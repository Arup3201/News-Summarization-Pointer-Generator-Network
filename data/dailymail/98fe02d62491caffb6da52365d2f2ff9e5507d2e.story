The world’s biggest accountancy firm Deloitte, powerfulbanks Credit Suisse and Chase Manhattan, and giant law firm Richards Butler, now part of Reed Smith –which represented Gordon Brown at the Leveson Inquiry – are all on a secret list belonging to a corrupt private detective.

A Mail on Sunday investigation has also established the rogue investigators jailed last year for illegally accessing information by ‘blagging’ appeared to be linked to international solicitors’ firms Herbert Smith –which represented former RBS boss Fred Goodwin – and Clyde & Co.

Last night a senior Westminster source 
indicated that all six firms are on the classified Serious 
Organised Crime Agency list currently locked away in a safe opposite 
theHouse of Commons.

‘Blagging’ is defined as obtaining information without consent.

But The Mail on Sunday has also uncovered new SOCA evidence often further blue-chip firms – whose names were recorded by one of the detectives – including Manchester United sponsor and insurance giant AON, and Jyske, a Danish bank.

The evidence we have seen shows that SOCA were aware of the names of the companies five years ago.

MPs have demanded that the companies’ names are made public.

There is no evidence that those named knowingly employed the rogue detectives in criminal activity on their behalf.

It is unclear whether the other names also appear on the list passed to MPs.

We can also reveal that Morgan Sindall, a construction company with multi-million-pound Government contracts and Greymans, a bespoke security firm specialising in work for celebrities, were both linked to the detectives in cases which resulted in prosecutions.

The list came to light two months ago. SOCA handed the secret list of 102 over to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee

Our revelations last night led to calls for the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry to be widened beyond the media so that it includes the use of private eyes to perform illegal acts by any clients.

The controversial SOCA list of 102 customers was handed over amid great secrecy to MPs on the Home Affairs Committee last month.

The existence of the clandestine list
 emerged two months ago. Since then there have been repeated calls for 
the agency dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’ to name the companies.

But
 SOCA’s former chairman Sir Ian Andrews – who resigned over a conflict 
of interest last month – prevented publication of the names as it could 
‘substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations 
by tainting them with public association with criminality’.

Last
 week Trevor Pearce, SOCA director general, said: ‘I repeat the point we
 are not alleging that the individuals or companies named on the list 
have or even may have committed a criminal offence.’

Today this newspaper is listing the names of companies and individuals who are linked to the convicted detectives.

Our enquiries into the SOCA files revealed:

There is no evidence that the company was aware of the illegal activity. SOCA’s investigation into private eyes, called Operation Millipede, began in 2008 when infamous blagger Daniel Summers, 34 – already under surveillance – advertised an iMac computer for sale from his home in Kingston-upon-Thames.

Undercover officers bought the computer for £590 and, after forensic examination, retrieved a number of files which Summers had sought to destroy.

This led police to four other private investigators, three of whom, along with Summers, were convicted of fraud for their part in the blagging of information on a number of victims in 2007 and 2008.

When arrested in May 2009, Summers told officers: ‘I know why you are here, this is massive. I’m in the biggest s**t imaginable.

‘Do you want me to talk now? I’ll sing like a canary.’

Summers, described as the ‘lynchpin’ along with former policeman John Spears, Graham Freeman and one other man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were all jailed at Kingston Crown Court last year.

After the case, SOCA tried to justify why they had only investigated the private eyes rather than any third parties by saying: ‘In recognition of the fact the operation might also uncover information relevant to other authorities, SOCA worked in partnership with a number of bodies including [data protection watchdog] the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

SOCA will now hand over any such information to its partners to determine whether further action is appropriate.’

But the ICO has still not been handed the information discovered during the Millipede investigation.

SOCA said they decided to make it available first to the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Tuleta team, an ongoing investigation into computer hacking, primarily by journalists.

But last week it emerged that while some evidence on the Millipede had been passed over to the Scotland Yard team, it was not until three weeks ago that Met Commander Neil Basu was handed an official list showing customers organised into business sectors.

SOCA’s decision to block publication came as the newspaper industry was targeted in the phone-hacking inquiry, which led to widespread public revulsion and the largest criminal investigation in British history over practices which include the hiring of corrupt private eyes.

In light of the revelations, there have been calls for Lord Justice Leveson's hacking inquiry to look beyond the media

Even lawyer Mark Lewis, representing the family of hacked murder victim Milly Dowler and a scourge of the tabloids, has said: ‘Consistency demands that the same rules apply to all, whether you run a newspaper, a pharmaceutical company or a law firm.’

Documents uncovered in our investigations suggest that in 2008 major tunnelling contractor Morgan Sindall investigated three of its own employees suspected of taking ‘kickbacks.’

Some of the work was carried out by Dan Summers. As with many of the cases, there was a complicated chain of command involving companies hiring private detectives who might subcontract work to other private detectives who may not be so scrupulous in their methods.

Last year a private investigator who was arrested and later cleared in the ‘blagging’ case took Morgan Sindall to an employment tribunal claiming he had been promised a job in return for keeping the company’s name out of the inquiry.

His case was thrown out, but during the hearing the company’s lawyers revealed that around September 2009 the firm was ‘advised by solicitors that it faced no charges and indeed that at no stage did it fear criminal prosecution’.

A spokesperson said: ‘Morgan Sindall Group takes issues of fraud and misconduct very seriously and operates a whistleblowing system through which individuals can register any concerns. All such investigations are conducted properly and within the confines of the law.’

Greymans, now called Optimal Risk, is one of the companies mentioned in Spears’s files. Greymans specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and wealthy individuals discreetly.

Founded by Falklands veteran and ex-Parachute Regiment Major Mike O’Neill, 56, it was formed in 1993 and boasts of clients including multinationals, finance houses and law firms.

Our files show that the company used the services of the corrupt detectives on numerous occasions, and a trail of emails prove it often directly engaged Summers – usually through its former financial controller, Andy Driver, who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011.

Mr O’Neill failed to answer our calls or emails last week, but former operations director and ex-Met Special Branch officer Christopher Cully, who left the firm three years ago, yesterday denied that Greymans had engaged Summers.

Another company linked to the case is Keltbray PLC. The large rail contractor does not appear on the SOCA list itself, but it is closely linked to a firm which does: Gamble Rail.

Deloitte- the world's biggest accountancy firm- was one of the names on the top secret list

Keltbray is a specialist demolition and civil engineering contractor recently awarded a £46 million contract to build power infrastructure alongside the West Coast Main line for Network Rail.

Since 2008, Keltbray has donated £63,500 to the Conservative Party and a further £20,000 to Dr Liam Fox MP, according to the Electoral Commission.

We have seen a fax sent in July 2008, by chartered accountant Michael Bilton, 59, a director of Gamble Rail, giving the bank account numbers of a business rival he wanted to be examined and ended with: ‘Requirement: Special investigation on his personal and business bank accounts.’

In 2009 Gamble went into liquidation and was taken over by Keltbray, and Bilton became finance director at one of the group’s companies, Keltbray Aspire Rail.

Contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Bilton said he had never been asked about the fax by SOCA or any other police officers, but admitted sending it.

‘It’s not something I’ve ever done before or since. At that time, I wasn’t asking anything illegal to be done. I didn’t know what someone could or couldn’t get through legal means,’ he said.

When we asked him, as a chartered accountant, whether he knew of any legal means to investigate an individual’s personal bank account without his consent, he replied: ‘I assumed – obviously wrongly – that it would be done by fair means, not foul means. I just hadn’t thought it through.’

A spokesman for Keltbray said: ‘We would, of course, prefer if you did not refer to Keltbray in your article, given that the events you refer to date back to 2008 when Mr Bilton was not employed by Keltbray.

He was employed by us from 2009 to 2012, and as a director of the rail division only in the last two of these years – from 2010 until 2012.’
