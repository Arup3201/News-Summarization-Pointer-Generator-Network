Swathes of Britain could be left totally underwater by a tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean, it has been claimed.

An earthquake off Portugal could trigger disastrous levels of flooding along the coast of the UK, scientists have said.

The Isles of Scilly and parts of Cornwall would be worst hit if there were a repeat of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.

Experts believe that a quake similar to the devastating one 250 years ago would send a 10ft wall of water towards the UK.

The tsunami would crash over the tip 
of Cornwall within a few hours – leaving much of the coast underwater 
and wiping the tiny Scilly Isles off the map.

The prospect of the natural disaster 
was raised at a meeting of the Devon and  Cornwall Local Resilience 
Forum, which includes police, town planners and emergency services.

Members of the LRF told the meeting 
they fear Britain could suffer its own version of the 2004 Boxing Day 
Tsunami. They want an early warning system to alert bathers and people 
living on the coast, similar to technology used across Asia and America.

St Martin's is one of the five inhabited Isles of Scilly - plus dozens of islets - with a total population of around 2,100

Paul Netherton, assistant chief 
constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and LRF chairman, said other 
countries have suffered by failing to plan ahead.

He told the forum: ‘After seeing the 
devastation in Japan and Thailand we have to ask the question of the 
scientific community – what and where would be the impact, is it likely 
and, if it is, should we plan for it?

A lot of areas would cope but in 
others it would cause a big problem. We have to consider whether we do 
anything differently than we do now for severe weather events.

‘Tsunami are different – you don’t know they are coming and the water keeps coming and coming.’

Britain was last hit by a tsunami in 1755, the year of the great Lisbon earthquake, the meeting in Bristol was told.

In the event of an earthquake in the 
Atlantic, the public would currently rely on the British Geological 
Survey to register the quake and the arrival of a subsequent wave at 
nearby Portugal.

Neil Hamlyn, LRF coordinator in Devon
 and Cornwall, said: ‘The Isles of Scilly could be affected greatly, the
 islands could be covered and disappear.’

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake almost 
totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas and had a magnitude in the 
range of 8.5 on the Richter scale.

Under the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004, the UK maintains a National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies.

The very high risk table is currently 
topped by pandemic flu, terrorist attacks and coastal flooding, though 
the last major civil flooding emergency was on the east coast in 1953.

Mr Hamlyn says a tsunami is in the top 20 of the second 
category of high risks.

Other uniquely regional threats include a
 nuclear submarine incident at Devonport dockyard and possible 
contamination from old tin mines in Cornwall.

Work has also already been done to 
predict the catastrophic impact should a massive slab of rock twice the 
volume of the Isle of Man break away from the island of La Palma, in the
 Canary Islands, and smash into the Atlantic Ocean.

The resulting tsunami, higher than 
Nelson’s Column and faster than a jet aircraft, would devastate the 
eastern seaboard of America and inundate much of southern Britain.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon Earthquake, occurred on Saturday, November 1, 1755.

The earthquake, which had its epicentre around 200 miles south-west of Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast, almost totally destroyed Lisbon and had a magnitude in the range of 8.5 on the Richter scale.

It struck in the morning and lasted between three and six minutes, leaving vast cracks 15ft wide in the city centre streets.

Around 40 minutes later, a vast tsunami engulfed the city's docks and centre, followed by two more waves.

Estimates place the death toll in 
Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people, making it one of the 
deadliest earthquakes in history.

But its devastating impact was not only felt in Portugal - it travelled more than a 1,000 miles before crashing into the British Isles.

At around 2pm on the same day, a wave reported to be between three to four metres in height hit the shores of Cornwall, smashing into Mount's Bay, the area's highest point, where it killed at least one person.

Estimates suggest that the death toll in Lisbon reached between 10,000 and 100,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history

The waves (there were two more) also struck the south coast and were even seen in the River Thames in London.

The tsunami even reached as far as Galway in Ireland, where it was described as being two metres high. 

French writer Arnold Boscowitz claimed the wave caused a 'great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall'.

Recent studies show that should another earthquake of the same magnitude happen, it could affect the south west of England.

A wave would take approximately five hours to travel to Britain, with maximum water heights reaching one to two metres around the vast coast of Cornwall.

But it would peak at around four metres (13ft) in Mount's Bay.
