The extended family of a Houston girl who was the lone survivor of a shooting that killed her parents and four siblings have asked people to stop donating money after raising $400,000. 

Cassidy Stay, 15, survived July 9 by playing dead as her parents and four younger siblings — Bryan, 13, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 6, and Zach, 4 — were gunned down. 

Although wounded herself, she called police and identified the gunman as her aunt's ex-husband, Ronald Lee Haskell.

Cassidy's relatives posted a statement on the gofundme.com account that was set up by a family acquaintance and a Harris County constable who was among the first officers to reach the scene after the teenager's 911 call.

The statement said: 'We have reached an amazing milestone on this fundraising site and wish to close it as we acknowledge our infinite appreciation to all who have contributed.

'The generosity of the local, state, national and even global community has humbled us beyond our ability to convey. 

'At this time we hope everyone will continue to reach out to those in our various communities with the same care and love that has been shown to us.'

Authorities said the family members were shot when they refused to divulge the whereabouts of Haskell's ex-wife.

Haskell faces multiple capital murder charges for the deaths of Stephen Stay, 39, his wife, Katie Lyon Stay, 34, and their children.

Haskell had been divorced from Katie Stay's sister and records showed he had a history of domestic violence.

Cassidy's relatives thanked those who have helped the teenager.

They said: 'We will keep you all in our prayers and ask you keep us in yours as we go forward. Our faith and knowledge of Jesus Christ and His plan for all of us will heal all heartache. 

'It is time for us as a family to develop a new routine, keeping our lost loved ones in our heart as we make a new path.'

A family spokeswoman, Mary Flood, said the family didn't want to suggest where to send donations.

'People have been so generous and loving that they just think they've got to help somebody else', she said.

Earlier this month, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling wrote a heartfelt letter to Cassidy Stay.

She had quoted part of a speech given by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in the third film of the popular series.

Bravely speaking at a memorial just days after the July 9 attack, Cassidy had quoted the film, saying: 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.'

An online campaign to get J.K. Rowling to contact the teenager led to the world-famous author writing to Cassidy in the voice of Dumbledore.

The handwritten note of comfort, written in purple ink, was accompanied by a wand, an acceptance letter to Harry Potter's school Hogwarts, a list of school supplies and a signed book.

A spokesman for the 49-year-old author told the newspaper: 'We can confirm that J.K. Rowling was in touch with Cassidy Stay, however, the contents of the letter remain private.'

Asked whether a meeting between the two may happen, she added: 'We wouldn't comment on that but [Cassidy's] is a remarkable story.'

After quoting from the film The Prisoner Of Azkaban, Cassidy said: 'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca, and Zach are in a much better place and that I'll be able to see them again one day. Stay strong.' 

The line was spoken in the film by Harry Potter's mentor Dumbledore - played by Sir Michael Gambon - when he addressed students at the start of the film.

The quote was credited to writer Steve Kloves, who transformed all seven books into screenplays.
