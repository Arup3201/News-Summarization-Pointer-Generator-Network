For sale: Stickle Tarn in Great Langdale has an attractive guide price of between £20,000 and £30,000

Popular with walkers, climbers and nature lovers, it is protected as a site of Specific Scientific Interest and still supplies water to the Langdale valley via Stickle Gyhll.

The plot for sale covers a total area of 24.2 acres (9.8 hectares) and includes a strip of land around the lake itself.

But any buyer will not be able to build so much as a wooden shack - as a protected spot the new owners will not be allowed to develop the area or restrict public access in any way.

Tranquil: The plot for sale covers a total area of 24.2 acres (9.8 hectares) and includes a strip of land around the lake itself

The tarn lies in the shadow of Pavey Ark (pictured) and Jack’s Rake and and was formerly used as a reservoir to supply the nearby Elterwater Gunpowder Works 

The plot for sale covers a total area of 24.2 acres (9.8 hectares) and includes a strip of land around the lake itself.

And if you're interested in viewing the property you'll need to be properly kitted out as it's a long trudge and the estate agent warn conditions can often be 'difficult under foot'. 

The property description states: 'Stickle Tarn is located in one of the most spectacular areas of the Lake District.

'The tarn itself extends to about 24.23 acres is surrounded by the wonderful Langdale Pikes with magnificent views across Langdale and beyond.

'Built as the water supply for the old Elterwater Gunpowder Works the tarn is still used as a water supply. The original water level was raised by a damn, and the regulations of the Reservoirs Act 1974 apply.

'The sale includes a strip of land surrounding the tarn. The whole area is a part of the Langdale Pikes [site of special scientific interest] and surrounded by common land.'

Also up for sale is stunning Lady Wood near Grasmere which has a guide price of £20,000 to £25,000

Blea Brows on Coniston Water has a guide price of £70,000 - £90,000 and is described as a 'truly wonderful, majestic stretch of shoreline'

Blue Hill and Redbank Wood is another beauty spot up for sale by the National Park Authority with a guide price of £100,000 - £120,000

Stickle Tarn is one of seven beauty spots put up for sale by the cash-strapped authority which plans to reinvest the money raised in other conservation projects.

The other properties are river frontage at Portinscale,  Blue Hill and Red Bank Wood at Ambleside, Blea Brows on the banks of Coniston Water, Baneriggs Wood between Grasmere and Rydal Water, Lady Wood, White Moss, Grasmere, and Yewbarrow in Longsleddale in the eastern Lake District.

The three woodland areas are expected to fetch at least £100,000 each and if all seven properties realise their guide prices, it would raise half a million pounds for the authority.

Potential buyers are required to fill in a questionnaire of their intentions and 'aspirations for the future' of woodland on the land.
