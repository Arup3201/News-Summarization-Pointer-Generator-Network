Two out of three people think the current benefits system in Britain is 'unfit for purpose' and should be replaced by tougher regulations, a new poll has revealed.

The survey of more than 1,800 people suggested the majority of Britons think the £208million-a-year welfare state is broken and should be scrapped in favour of new rules about who can claim benefits.

The YouGov poll, commissioned by Channel 5, also revealed that 76 per cent oppose immigrants being allowed benefits in their first year of residency.

Despite considering the system broken, 45 per cent of those questioned said they felt benefit claimants themselves are portrayed unfairly.

The poll comes ahead of a live television debate on the issue later this evening.

Channel 5 is screening The Big Benefits Row: Live at 9pm to discuss research which shows huge public concern about the current system.

The panel is due to include Benefits Street's White Dee who will give her view of the benefits system and tell her own story, as well as former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and ex-Tory MP Edwina Currie.

Outspoken commentator Katie Hopkins and former model Annabel Gies - who once lived on benefits as a single mother - are also appearing.

Speaking to the Daily Express, Robert Oxley of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'The benefits system has failed both those claiming and those paying for it. Welfare should never be an alternative to work but without reforms it is still too easy to subsist on the dole'.

Channel 5 director of programming, Ben Frow, said: 'With Benefits and Proud airing on Channel 5 last October and subsequent series from other broadcasters, the benefits debate is very much part of the news agenda.'

'The Big Benefits Row: Live is Channel 5 shining the spotlight on an argument that has gripped the nation.'
