The victim of a glassing attack by soap opera actress Crystal Hunt has said the incident destroyed her chances of ever having a baby.

Elizabeth Nam said 'Guiding Light' star Crystal Hunt caused her such distress when she smashed a pint glass in her face, she feels she has no hope of finding a relationship.

According to court documents obtained by TMZ, Ms Nam says the attack that left her with cuts on her face has ruined her life.

She says she had been 'actively searching for a mate,' before adding, 'the assault might have killed my future baby due to my biological clock ticking'.

Hunt, 29, a former Daytime Emmy Award nominee, hurled the glass at the victim following an argument at Pearl's Liquor Bar in West Hollywood  on December 13, prosecutors told TMZ.

Ms Nam required medical attention following the attack, and claims she has seen an army of doctors since then. 

These apparently include a plastic surgeon to fix the scars on her face, as well as psychological help to fix the emotional scars. 

Hunt was arrested and charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon.

The actress pleaded no contest to one count of felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

If she had pleaded not guilty and been convicted of the charge, she could have been imprisoned for up to five years, OnTheRedCarpet.com reported at the time. 

But instead, Hunt avoided prison after LA Superior Court Judge Kathryn Solorzano sentenced her to three years of probation and 45 days of  work for the California Department of Transportation.

Following her arrest last year, the actress reportedly claimed she had been acting in self-defense when she threw the pint glass filled with water because the woman had been harassing her.
