Dozing teacher Sue Hall was given a parking fine after a warden ticketed her car while she sleeping inside.

The 51-year-old fell asleep after dropping her daughter Lucy, 15, and a friend off at the gym and awoke to find the warden putting a £50 fine on her windscreen.

Mrs Hall, from Southampton, said she was 'really tired' after a busy day at work when she fell asleep around 4pm.

Sue Hall with the £50 parking fine she received while sleeping in her car as she waited for her daughter to finish at the gym; she had purchased an hours' parking but it had expired five minutes earlier

She had purchased an hour's parking and can't understand why the warden didn't simply wake her up to let her know it had expired.

She said: 'I'm really angry about being given this ticket.'

Mrs Hall said the sound of the ticket being placed on her windscreen woke her up. 

'I couldn't believe it. Instead of waking me up, he had gone ahead and fined me.

'I got out of my car and said, 'What are you doing?' and he told me I had gone over my parking time by five minutes.'

Mrs Hall, who is appealing the ticket, can't understand why the parking warden didn't simply wake her up to tell her that her parking had expired

Mrs Hall said she asked the warden why 
he didn't wake her and he replied that he wasn't sure if he had even 
noticed she was in the car.

She said: 'He had the attitude that rules were rules and walked off.'

Mrs Hall said she accepts her allotted time had expired, but believes the warden could have been more considerate.

She said: 'It's the principle of the thing I'm furious about.

'To me, parking tickets are supposed to be given for illegal or inappropriate parking, not making money out of things this.

'I don't know if the parking attendants have a quota of tickets to fill. I do everything to avoid getting a ticket because I can't stand getting them.'

Southampton City Council said they could not comment on individual cases but said their wardens follow strict rules when issuing fines.
