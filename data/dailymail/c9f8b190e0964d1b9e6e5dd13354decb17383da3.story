Greek authorities need to take rapid action against malaria as recent outbreaks have exposed the already crisis-hit country to a possible re-establishment of the disease, scientists in Athens said today.

Several cases of malaria have been discovered in the southern regions of Lakonia and East Attica, and researchers warned that stricter controls are needed.

Greece's healthcare system has already suffered severe budget cuts, and experts fear vulnerable groups are not getting sufficient treatments.

Further crisis: Cuts to public services such as hospitals have been cause of protest in Greece in the past, but scientists fear authorities may have a new crisis on their hands with recent malaria outbreaks

‘It is clear that surveillance and vector control programmes should be strengthened and rapidly intensified,’ researchers at the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP), wrote in online journal Eurosurveillance.

They urge the Greek authorities to take measures such as insecticide spraying, eliminating standing water and tracking 
mosquito populations as well as people infected with the disease.

This year Greece has reported 75 cases of malaria. Most were contracted abroad but 16 cases were local.

The American Centre for Disease Control are advising visitors to the worst hit region, Evrotas, to take antimalarial pills, according to the Telegraph.

Malaria, which causes high fever and 
chills and kills hundreds of thousands of people a year worldwide, was 
once endemic in Greece but was officially eliminated in 1974.

However,
Greece has established populations of potentially malarial mosquito 
species, and last year, 40 cases of locally-acquired malaria were 
reported, mainly in Lakonia and Attica.

Danger: Malaria is contracted through mosquito bites and is common in Africa and Asia although scientists warn that it may return to Greece unless authorities take action

Apostolos Veizis, director of medical-operational support for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Greece, warned in a statement earlier this month that any malaria plan could not work properly unless access to healthcare was available to all.

'It is very important to monitor the situation and invest in mosquito control," he said. "But medically speaking if people cannot be examined and properly diagnosed, it's easy to lose sight of the problem.'

The HCDCP experts said a coordinated effort had begun with the collaboration of Greek authorities, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organisation (WHO) experts to prevent malaria returning.
