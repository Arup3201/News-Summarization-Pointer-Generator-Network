Big family: Peggy Koller's decision not to join a convent led her to marry and eventually become mother to eleven children. Today, her sons and daughters, 56 grandchildren and 59 great-grand-children all say Koller is the family social director who keeps the group informed of everyone's comings and goings

'It's a really busy life,' said Koller, who spends most every weekend at a graduation, wedding, or some other ceremony. 'I'm always at somebody's house for dinner. It's wonderful'

'It's a really busy life,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I'm always at somebody's house for dinner. It's wonderful.'

Koller spends all her weekends bouncing from graduations to weddings to baptisms and other ceremonies and does whatever she can to keep from missing one of the life events.

'She’s the type of person who, even at 91, if you asked her, "Granmom, will you help me with this?’ or, ‘Can you do this?,’ she will,”' one of her granddaughters Lauren Naldzin told ABC News.

On the rare day when she does't have an event to attend, Koller exercises and attributes her longevity to the healthful practice.

Peggy married her husband William in 1942. They opened a funeral home in Philadelphia that two of their children still run. William died in 2008

'The exercising, I think, is the thing that has kept me going,' she said. 'I’ve exercised my whole lifetime.'

Koller told ABC that she originally wanted have 12 children, but she missed the mark with her husband William by just one.

The two started their life together when they married in 1942 before opening a funeral home in Philadelphia, Koller Funeral Home.

Mr. Koller died in 2008. The funeral home is still run by one of their sons and one of their daughters.

'My husband and I always had a lot of faith in God, and I think that just helped because we figured we were doing the will of God and he would look out for us, and he did,' Koller said. 'It's like [there were] little miracles all throughout my life and big ones, too.'
