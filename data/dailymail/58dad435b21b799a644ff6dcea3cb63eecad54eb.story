Glistening with oil, flexing their muscles and donning skimpy underwear, they are certainly a striking sight.

Meet the bodybuilding contestants - and winners - at the Arnold Sports Festival 2015, which is currently underway in Columbus, Ohio.

The annual festival, which includes more than 50 sports and events, is named after former Mr Universe, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

And on Saturday, the seven-time world bodybuilding champion, who served two terms as Governor of California, was pictured handing out prizes to the muscly winner and finalists of the world-renowned Arnold Classic professional men’s bodybuilding championships.

Dexter 'The Blade' Jackson, a 45-year-old who won the contest in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2015, was awarded a staggering $130,000 after scooping his fifth title at the Columbus Convention Center. Branch Warren, meanwhile, was gifted $75,000 for achieving second place.

In other bodybuilding categories, Brian Shaw came first in the Arnold Strongman World Championships, Jose Raymond won the 212 Class and Ashley Kaltwasser scooped $7,000 after placing first in the 2015 Bikini International contest, dressed in a glittery blue and silver bikini.

On Saturday, Schwarzenegger, 67, who was the youngest person ever to win the Mr Universe title at just 20 years old in 1968, welcomed participants and guests to the  center, according to 10TV News. 'Everyone having a fun time?' the Hollywood star asked the crowd.

The sports festival, which attracts professional athletes from across the world, began on Thursday and finishes on Sunday evening. One man, who flew to Columbus from Belgium to support his friend, said of the event: It's huge I really didn't expect it. I really like it.'

In addition to bodybuilding, attendees can watch people compete in fencing, gymnastics and even chess.

On Sunday morning, the Arnold was scheduled to kick off with a 5km run.
