Earl Hayes, a friend of Mayweather, shot wife Stephanie Moseley, a dancer who starred in the VH1 show Hit The Floor, while in a rage over her alleged infidelity.

Hayes is believed to have shot his wife and then turned the gun on himself at a high-end LA apartment complex, according to police sources.

TMZ reports that Mayweather was a witness  and heard everything after Hayes called him.

When the rapper, once signed to Mayweather's record label Philthy Rich Records, said he was going to kill his wife, the boxer pleading with him not to - but to no avail.

LAPD raced to the Palazzo East apartments at 7:30am after residents heard a woman screaming and up to 10 gunshots, a police spokesperson said.

A SWAT team was forced to knock down the door of the apartment and, once inside, found a back bedroom door closed.

When they sought to go into the room, they heard two more gunshots, police said. 

'I suddenly heard screaming,' neighbour Charles Segal told NBC 'and then the screaming stopped and the next minute, cops all over.'

Hayes' friend Burrel Wilks said the married couple had been in the process of breaking up

Moseley had performed as a backing dancer for Chris Brown and on Monday he posted a tribute to her

Burrel Wilks, Hayes’ life coach and close friend, described the married couple as long-time partners who were in the process of breaking up, reports KTLA.

'I've had sit downs with both of them so whatever happened behind those doors we'll never know, but I heard out of her own mouth, he never raised a hand on her so this is kind of stunning,' he said.

Moseley played ‘Devil Girl/Arelly’ in Hit The Floor, the VH1 drama series about an NBA cheerleading team called the Los Angeles Devil Girls.

She had also appeared in movies including The Twlight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, Mirror Mirror and Sparkle and as a backing dancer for singers including Janet Jackson, Chris Brown and Britney Spears.

On Monday, Brown posted a tribute to Moseley on Instagram. 'RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family,' he wrote.
