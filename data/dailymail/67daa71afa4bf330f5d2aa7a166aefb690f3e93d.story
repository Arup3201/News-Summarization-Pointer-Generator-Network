Britain’s most overcrowded train routes were named yesterday, as it emerged some carry double the number of passengers they should at peak times.

The 4.46pm from London Euston to Crewe came out on top, with more people forced to stand than can find seats, according to figures from the Department for Transport.

Last autumn, the London Midland service carried an average of 435 standard-class passengers at its most crowded point, more than twice its seated capacity of 206.

Packed like sardines: A new government league table has laid bare the parlous state of Britain's rail capacity

Critics said that if the train companies were carrying animals instead of human beings they would be prosecuted for cruelty.

The findings in a new Government ‘league table’ of cramped carriages come amid rising anger over soaring train fares, bumper rail profits and poor punctuality, that has led angry passengers to demand better value for money.

Second worst was South West Trains’ 7.32am commuter service from Woking to London Waterloo, which was designed to carry 738 passengers but actually crammed 1,278 on board - or 540 more than it should.

It was followed by the 7.21am Oxford to London Paddington service operated by First Great Western – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by disgruntled passengers - which was 73 per cent overcrowded.

And on the 6.33pm Heathrow Express service, 806 passengers squeezed into a space designed for 476 – or 330 too many.

But London was not the only city affected. First TransPennine Express’s 6.30am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough was 66 per cent over capacity, with 275 people in a space designed for 166.

The report from the Department for Transport also looked at overcrowding in Spring 2013. Here again the 4.46pm to Crewe had more than double the passengers it should have carroied.

It crammed 414 passengers into space for 206 – some 208 more than it should. 

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘Commuters are being treated worse than cattle when it comes to overcrowding because EU laws prevent animals being transported in such cramped conditions.

'Our real time train figures show four out of every 10 trains in the South East actually running late, means they are getting the worst of all worlds, overcrowded and slow trains.'

Attack: Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh described the report as a 'misery map'

The new Government figures show that nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of morning peak trains into the capital are overcrowded with six out of ten passengers left standing.

Just under one million passengers arrive into central London every day.

The report notes: ‘In London, 120,000 passengers had to stand at trains’ busiest points in the morning peak, 20 per cent of the overall total.’  

Based on rail journeys on a typical autumn weekday in 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) figures showed crowding figures for London, nine other English cities and Cardiff.

Overcrowding in London was worst at Paddington station, while there were large increases in overcrowding compared with autumn 2012 at Blackfriars, Euston, King’s Cross and St Pancras stations.

First Great Western was the train company with highest level of overcrowding of any London and south east England operator. The next-worse was London Midland.

Peak overcrowding across the 11 cities surveyed saw 2.6 per cent of passengers exceeding the capacity of the trains they were travelling on.

Overcrowding was higher in the three-hour morning peak from 7am to 10am, with 3.4per cent passengers in excess of capacity – the official measure.

Overcrowding was higher in London than in other cities, with an average rate of 3.1 per cent compared to 1 per cent across the other ten cities. 

The highest overcrowding outside London was in Sheffield, which had 2.6 per cent rate.

On London Overground the design of new trains, with fewer seats, meant that in autumn 2013 as many as 50.8 per cent of passengers stood in the morning peak and 45.4 per cent stood in the afternoon peak.

David Sidebottom, the director of watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘Overcrowding is a daily struggle for many commuters. Our latest rail passenger survey found that 30 per cent of commuters were unhappy about overcrowding on their train.’

Rammed: On average, peak trains into the capital run 3.1 per cent over capacity, but some are much worse

There was fury this week as thousands of commuters saw their rail fares double.

Changes imposed by the Government on the main rail company in the north of England, Northern Rail, mean some people will be paying 162 per cent more than they did last Friday.

It forced Northern Rail to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the West Coast franchise saga in 2012.

To soften the blow Mr Osborne also announced that countrywide inflation-busting fare rises planned in January will be limited to the rate of inflation in July - 2.5 per cent – and not rise by an above-inflationary 3.5 per cent as previously planned.

Mr Osborne is also scrapping the ‘flex’ system where companies could raise some fares by up to two percentage points. He said more than 250,000 season ticket holders will save £75 across 2014 and 2015. 

A big increase in capacity was needed to cope with increased demand for trains, he said.

He added: ‘This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand, as well as ensuring that overcrowding doesn’t get worse as passenger numbers increase as predicted.'

James MacColl of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘These figures show overcrowding is getting worse at the country’s main stations.

‘With up to one-in-five passengers having to stand and ticket prices increasing much faster than wages, rail commuters will be questioning the value for money they get.’

Labour’s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘As well as enduring inflation-busting fares increases, this misery map of the most-crowded services shows the reality of life for commuters under David Cameron.

'Some services are carrying twice as many passengers as they should, a far cry from the "comfortable commuting" which out-of-touch ministers imagine on the railways.’

Transport Minister Claire Perry said: ‘I understand the frustration of rail passengers forced to stand on busy services and that is why I am calling on the operators to do more.

‘Since 1995 passenger journeys on the railway have more than doubled, with 1.6billion journeys being recorded in the last year.

Worst-hit: The most overcrowded service was the 4.46pm from London Euston (pictured) to Crewe. The four carriage train had space for 206 standard class passengers, including many standing, but actually carried 435

‘This means that on too many journeys, passengers have to stand in cramped conditions. Train operators must act now, they must find new ways to create space on the network and in their trains.’

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, representing Network Rail and rail operators, blamed the growth in passenger numbers over the last 15 years for the problem.

‘The official measure of crowding during peak times now compared with then has remained largely unchanged despite a doubling in passenger journeys,' the spokesman said.

'But we recognise that some services remain crowded and understand people’s frustration when they cannot get a seat.’

Train companies were planning to increase peak-time seats into and out of many major cities by a third in the next five years, the spokesman added.
