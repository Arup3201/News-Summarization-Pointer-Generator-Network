Abu Hamza and five other dangerous terror suspects could follow Abu Qatada in being freed to walk Britain’s streets.

Unelected Euro judges are preparing to rule if the six – who are accused of running terror camps and extremist websites or plotting atrocities – can be extradited to the U.S.

And, in the wake of Europe’s ruling that fanatic Qatada cannot be kicked out of Britain, Whitehall officials are braced for defeat.

Hate preacher Hamza is claiming that his potential jail term in America could constitute a breach of his human rights because it is potentially ‘inhuman’ or ‘degrading’.

Once there is a Euro court ruling that any of the six cannot be extradited, British judges are expected to follow the precedent set by the Qatada case and free them on bail.

In a worst-case scenario, it could mean Hamza and his fellow fanatics being released in the run-up to the London Olympics – the biggest security challenge this country has faced in peacetime. Experts have already warned there are up to 200 would-be suicide bombers in the UK, including ‘lone wolves’ seeking religious justification from the likes of Hamza or Qatada to carry out atrocities.

The Strasbourg judges are considering whether jail terms of up to 50 years in the U.S. without parole – the sentences faced by Hamza and the others – would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’.

For all the defendants, except Hamza, they also agreed to examine whether their potential detention in ‘supermax’ high security prisons was a breach of human rights.

The court said Hamza had no case against the conditions at a supermax prison because his disabilities – he lost his hands in an explosion in Afghanistan and is blind in one eye – mean he would spend only a short time there before being transferred to a prison with a less severe regime.

The latest revelations came after another day dominated by the disclosure that Qatada, one of the world’s most dangerous fanatics, will be released on bail within days.

Immigration judges ruled he could be released in the wake of the European Court of Human Rights ruling that he cannot be deported to Jordan in case some of the evidence used against him in a planned terror trial has been obtained by torture.

Unacceptable: Home Secretary Theresa May said that she 'vehemently disagreed' with the decision to bail Abu Qatada

Home Secretary Theresa May was called to the Commons to explain how she intends to protect the public from Qatada, a man rated so dangerous that he will be placed on a 22-hour curfew.

She told the Commons she ‘vehemently’ disagreed with the bail decision, saying: ‘It simply isn’t acceptable that, after guarantees from the Jordanians about his treatment, after British courts have found he is dangerous, after his removal has been approved by the highest courts in the land, we still cannot deport dangerous foreign criminals.’

She added: ‘The right place for a terrorist is a prison cell and the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell, far away from Britain.

‘That’s why we will do everything we can within the existing legal regime to deport Qatada, and we’re doing everything we can to reform that regime to avoid these cases in future.’

But backbench Tories queued up to demand Britain’s immediate withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights and moves to neuter the power of the Strasbourg judges.

Shipley MP Philip Davies told Mrs May: ‘It is no good you huffing and puffing about the decision – what the British public want to know is if we cannot secure the reforms we need from the European Court of Human Rights, are we going to withdraw from the European Convention?’

Mark Pritchard, secretary of the Tories’ powerful 1922 committee, said the ECHR was ‘undermining British justice and British national security’.

It emerged yesterday that Qadata could be free from all controls within just two years if he stays in Britain. By the end of 2014 both bail and control order powers will have expired – leaving him entirely at liberty.

David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Qatada could be subject to a new type of control order known as a TPIM only for a maximum of two years before it expires.

Previous control orders could be repeatedly renewed. TPIMs can be renewed in exceptional circumstances, but this is expected to be extremely difficult.

A ruling by the Euro judges is expected as early as this month on whether it would be a breach of human rights to extradite Hamza and the five others who the Americans are desperate to put on trial.

They include Hamza’s trusted lieutenant Haroon Aswat, who is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Oregon.

Hamza was jailed for seven years in February 2006 for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque in North London. His sentence has now been served and, if extradition proceedings are abandoned, he would be eligible for release.

Baba Ahmad and Seyla Ahsan, accused of conspiracy to commit terrorist atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups, have been held in high-security British jails for between five and seven years while they fight extradition on human rights grounds.

Another man, Khaled Al Fawwaz, has been in jail here since 1999. Allegedly a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, he was arrested in connection with bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies in east Africa which killed more than 200 in 1998.

The sixth man, Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings and has been held in prison for 13 years.

The British court’s ruling on Monday that Qatada should be freed on bail is based on the fact that, if the prospect of extradition or deportation becomes unlikely, it is unfair to continue to hold a suspect indefinitely.

Officials fear this principle would also be applied in the case of the six wanted by the U.S., in the event of an adverse verdict from Europe.

Releasing the men would give security officials a massive headache in the run-up to the Olympics.

Monitoring fanatics round-the-clock is hugely expensive and time consuming.

Bugged: Usman Khan was heard by MI5 discussing plans to recruit radicals to a terrorist training camp in Kashmir

An extremist inspired by Al Qaeda called on British Muslims to claim benefits to fund a terrorist training camp, a court heard yesterday.

Usman Khan, 20, was bugged at his home by MI5 discussing plans to recruit 100 radicals to attend the camp in Kashmir to learn to use guns.

Discussing fund-raising during a late-night meeting, he declared radicals could receive in benefits in a day what people earn in a month in the disputed region split between India and Pakistan. ‘On Jobseeker’s Allowance we can earn that, never mind working for that,’ he said.

Khan added that there were only three possible outcomes for him and fellow jihadists: victory, martyrdom or prison.

Members of the group also discussed launching a ‘Mumbai-style’ atrocity in London while others talked about setting off pipe bombs in the toilets of two pubs in Stoke, the court heard.

The group’s other targets included the London Stock Exchange and the capital’s Mayor Boris Johnson, Woolwich Crown Court heard.

Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said members of the group were recorded in December 2010 calling the late Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden ‘beautiful’.

Khan, of Stoke-on-Trent, is one of nine men being sentenced for terror offences.

He has admitted engaging in the preparation of terrorism.

The hearing continues.

We have been contacted by Arnaud Mafille
following the publication of this item.  He would like us to make clear
it was reported that Abu Qatada had ‘influenced Djamel Beghal, an 
Algerian linked to the Finsbury Park mosque, who was jailed in France 
for plotting to blow up the American embassy in Paris’ (Mail). In 
reality, Beghal was sentenced to prison in France even though the French
Court of Appeal decided in 2005 that there was no evidence of the 
existence of any plan to bomb the embassy apart from statements made by 
Beghal while in illegal secret detention in the UAE. The Appeal Court 
dismissed these because they had been extracted under torture.
