Guingamp defender Benjamin Angoua took an unorthodox method to try and stop his goalkeeper getting sent off. 

Stopper Mamadou Samassa was about to be given his marching order during the club's Ligue 1 clash against Montpellier for his furious protests after conceding a goal. 

But as referee Philippe Kalt was brandishing the red card, the Ivorian international knocked it out of the official's hand not once but twice. 

On the second attempt Angoua succeeded but after fumbling the card, Kalt dismissed Samassa. 

Angoua fortunately escaped without further punishment in Guingamp's 2-1 defeat on Saturday.
