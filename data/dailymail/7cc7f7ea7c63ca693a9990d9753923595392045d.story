Nick Easter rolled back the years to inspire Harlequins to a richly deserved victory as the Londoners made a mockery of their abject domestic form.

The former England No 8 produced a magnificent display at the back of a resurgent Quins scrum alongside returning Red Rose captain Chris Robshaw, scoring a vital second-half try while tackling himself almost to a standstill at a packed Twickenham Stoop.

Conor O’Shea’s men — lying ninth in the Aviva Premiership — are now three points clear at the top of Pool 2 in the European Cup with three wins from three.

Victory over three-time European champions Leinster in Dublin next Saturday night would make Quins red-hot favourites to qualify with something to spare and, at 36, Easter is playing like a man 10 years younger.

‘It’s only half-time against Leinster and half-time in this group,’ he said. ‘It’s fantastic to win our home games but we’ve been in this position before and we know we’re going to face another war next week. If we couldn’t get up for a game like this then we really shouldn’t be here. It’s another moment in Quins history today.’

Five-and-a-half years after the Bloodgate scandal rocked the West London club, this comprehensive victory over the same opponents should go a long way to finally closing that unwanted chapter in their history. Easter was simply magnificent. The 47-cap veteran has not played for England since the last World Cup and it is stretching the bounds of probability to suggest he could feature in next year’s tournament. But on this kind of form he is surely worthy of consideration.

‘I’ve always said it,’ O’Shea said when asked if Easter could feasibly play for England again. ‘Nick is an old head who can cover a few positions.

‘Sometimes when you’re in those kind of matches you need those old people around. We have a lot of youngsters who are learning on the hoof but when he plays like that he is a very special player. I’m very fortunate I’ve been around the club while he’s been here. He’s towards the tail end of his career but he’s still got a few years left in him. Brad Thorn is still playing and he’s 40!’

Robshaw was not far behind his back-row partner as the Quins pack produced a sensationally high work-rate allied to a rock-solid scrummaging display which was light years away from last week’s embarrassing Premiership mauling at the hands of Bath.

Easter and Robshaw made 13 tackles apiece but Quins will point to an outstanding collective effort which suggests they have turned a corner following a disjointed start to the season.

The win was built on a phenomenal scrummaging performance which saw Joe Marler give his former team-mate Mike Ross a torrid afternoon before being forced off late in the second half with a shoulder injury.

Easter said: ‘The way the scrum is going this season it’s a real battle and hard to predict, but we got on top today. That was really pleasing after last week.’

O’Shea remained confident that Marler, whom he described as ‘battered’ after four internationals in succession, will be fit for next Saturday’s return fixture at the Aviva Stadium, although fly-half Nick Evans is more doubtful after lasting only 13 minutes before being replaced by 21-year-old new recruit Tim Swiel.

‘I thought the players showed unbelievable desire today,’ O’Shea added. ‘We just have to make sure we’re ready for the Aviva Stadium. We have to be 20 or 30 per cent better than we were today. But the players are buzzing after that.

‘Sometimes it’s about grit and we showed that in abundance.’

South African Swiel, brought in on a short-term contract to cover for the injured Ben Botica, looked nervous at times but showed plenty of heart to kick three from five attempts. The sides were level at 9-9 at half-time but Easter’s 53rd-minute try — taken superbly with his hands outstretched over his head — put Quins in front and they never looked back.

Quins’ Fijian winger Aseli Tikoirotuma intercepted Rob Kearney’s attempted pass six minutes later and ran the length of the pitch to score. But despite two late penalties from the flawless Ian Madigan, Leinster could not quite drag themselves back into contention.

Leinster head coach Matt O’Connor said: ‘It was disappointing. We didn’t control the set-piece or get any dominance. We have to get that right next week.’

An impish left-foot drop-goal from scrum-half Danny Care, who also produced a fine all-round display, sealed victory for O’Shea’s men and set up a mouth-watering encounter in Dublin next week.

Easter’s name will be the first on the team-sheet.
