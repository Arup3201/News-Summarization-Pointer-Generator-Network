Emmanuel Adebayor has been released from hospital after contracting malaria but will still miss Tottenham's pre-season tour of North America.

The striker was hospitalised on Saturday after feeling unwell and was diagnosed with a mild bout of the disease before being released two days later.

It will be enough to keep the 30-year-old in England while his team-mates train abroad for pre-season.

The club said the illness was detected at an early stage and Adebayor was responding well to treatment.

Adebayor requires a minimum of seven days before returning to training, and was advised not to travel on medical grounds.

The Togo international enjoyed a fine season last term after Tim Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas as boss, and will be hoping to impress the new man at the helm, Mauricio Pochettino.
