A couple whose car was damaged by a pothole have won a victory over the local council – who lied to avoid paying compensation.

Jane Tramontana, 59, drove over the 3ft-wide hole and the collision blew out the tyres on her Nissan Micra.

When her husband Phillip Charles, 49, arrived at the scene, the road was ‘littered’ with cars that had hit the hole.

But when they reported the incident to Northamptonshire County 
Council in January last year, the authority claimed to have no knowledge
 of the road defect and refused to pay compensation for the damaged 
vehicle.

The couple decided to fight the ruling and are now celebrating 
victory after a court ordered the council to pay them £311.

Northampton 
County Court heard the authority had already been informed of the 
dangerous pothole, in Sutton Bassett, and had recorded it as a priority 
case to be fixed within five days.

The authority had actually been informed of the dangerous pothole but claimed to have no knowledge of it

But the repairs were not carried out and council chiefs claimed to have no knowledge of the problem.

District Judge Sarah Watson told the court: ‘There are clear problems with the way the council deals with dangerous potholes.’

Following
 the year-long legal battle grandfather-of-two Mr Charles urged other 
road users to fight councils for compensation.

The electronics engineer 
yesterday described the case as ‘a nightmare’.

He said: ‘When I got to 
Sutton Bassett I found the road just littered with cars that had hit 
this hole – you couldn’t avoid it.

'Every one had damaged their tyres. I 
called the police in the end because it was obviously dangerous.’

The council denied being told of the pothole, but ‘they clearly had’, Mr Charles said.

‘We
 were told that people had reported it and since it is dangerous they 
should have fixed it straightaway. But they still tried to claim it 
wasn’t a problem. They even sent us a group of reports that were 
obviously for a different hole.’

This is not the first time a council has tried to wriggle out of paying compensation.

Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that Essex County Council council should foot the repair bill.

But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame.

They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace.

But Mr Cattrall used a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months earlier – but the council had ignored it.

The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed.

But even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the disagreement went to the small claims court.

At a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115.

He added: ‘They then bombard you with all sorts of documents and hope they will confuse you into just going away.

‘It’s
 just not acceptable … These potholes are dangerous for any road users. A
 cyclist could be sent flying off their bike and die.’

The couple from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, are calling on councils to change their policies on fixing road defects.

Most
 authorities promise to repair dangerous potholes within five days of 
inspection, but before 2010 there was a policy of two-hour or 24-hour 
repairs for ‘critical’ problems.

The pair said the pothole in Sutton 
Bassett was so dangerous it should have been fixed on the same day.

Miss
 Tramontana, a medical receptionist, told the court: ‘This defect was, 
without any doubt, a serious road hazard and should have been repaired 
immediately following inspection given its size and location.’

Northamptonshire County Council refused to comment.

The
 legal victory comes just one month after the Mail reported that 
62-year-old Frank Cattrall forced Essex County Council to pay £615 for 
his car repairs after he proved they had ignored potholes.

A council worker had reported the 18in-by-6in hole that damaged his car three months before the incident but it was not fixed.
