The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim.

Banks have so far paid out £17.3billion to those who were wrongly sold PPI alongside loans and credit cards.

If the FCA proposals are passed, then victims could be barred from making a claim three years after they first realised the mis-selling had taken place.

The City watchdog will announce its plans in the summer, which could involve introducing the deadline, an advertising campaign to alert mis-selling victims who have not yet put in a claim, or other rule changes.

Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years.

'To make it work fairly for consumers they'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit, so people know they have been mis-sold.

'More importantly they'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to, knowing most people won't take it this far. 

'I can't see either of those things happening, so a time limit should be a strict no-go.'

Tens of millions of PPI policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans, mortgages and credit cards. 

They were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so. 

Often, victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years. Since the scandal broke, banks have been inundated with PPI complaints.

Although many of these come from actual wronged customers, others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls.

Alongside millions of legitimate claims, banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms.

The independent Financial Ombudsman Service says it is receiving around 4,000 PPI complaints a week, down from a peak of 12,000. It finds in the customer's favour in roughly two-thirds of cases.

Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: 'I fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly. 

The banks had their hands in customers' pockets for years. Victims shouldn't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around.'
