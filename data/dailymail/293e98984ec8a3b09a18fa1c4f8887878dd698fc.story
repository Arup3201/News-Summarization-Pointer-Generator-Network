The tragic story of an 18-year-old girl from a prominent family in Florida overdosing on prescription pain medication just 18 months after her parents first realized she had a drug problem has inspired a short film about addiction that made its debut at the Sarasota Film Festival last week, and serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drug use.

Brandi Meshad - a graduate of the posh Out-of-Door Academy who'd been accepted at the University of Alabama with dreams of becoming a broadcast journalist - died in 2011 from on overdose of prescription painkillers at the age of 18.

Journals kept by the successful student revealed her daily struggle to kick her addiction in the months leading up to her death - and serve as inspiration for the short film cryptically titled No Real Than You Are by Vince Dale, an aspiring filmmaker.

Potential: Brandi did well in school and had been accepted to the University of Alabama with dreams of becoming a broadcast journalist

Dale says that the film tries to tell the story of his hometown - Sarasota - through one of the common themes currently plaguing much of southern Florida: Addiction to prescription drugs like Oxycontin and roxicodone, the opiates of choice for Meshad.

The cryptic title of the film comes from words written on the front of a giant Lego doll that washed up on the beaches in Sarasota in 2011 - on the front of the doll, the words No Real Than You Are are printed in white type. 

According to Dale, Meshad's story is similar to a lot of stories about addiction in Sarasota - it can sometimes go unnoticed until it's too late.

'The first time we realized she was using until she died was an 18-month
 period,' Brandi's mother, Lisa, told the Herald-Tribune. 'For most of that time she was 
sober â€” and that's the scary part.'

Prior to her prescription pill use, Meshad had dabbled with alcohol use, but no more or less than your standard high school seniors.

Meshad first started using Oxycontin when she was given a few pills by a friend to help her sleep. She ultimately spiraled out of control with the drug and was found dead in her grandparents' home on March 8, 2011.

Her journal entries tell the story of the slippery slope of addiction to prescription pain medication that ultimately ended with her death.

'Addiction isn't any ordinary monster,' Brandi wrote in journal entries shared with the Herald-Tribune. 'It's like a giant octopus weaving its tentacles not just around you but through you, squeezing not hard enough to kill you, but enough to keep you from feeling until you try to get away.

Signs: Lisa Meshad says Brandi's behavior began to get erratic in the moths leading up to her untimely death

'Try, and you hunger for its grasping clutch ... your need intensifying exponentially every minute you refuse to admit its being.'

Meshad's rebellious side began the summer before she started her senior year of high school - according to her mother, the teenage girl had declared her 'right to party.'

As she sank further into the depths of addiction, Meshad's behavior went from disinterested to eccentric, often throwing erratic tantrums - and the fights with her mother began to happen more frequently.

'Pills were the new best friend,' Meshad said. 'Mom is the enemy now.'

Meshad's mother says she thought the change in behavior was due to a divorce she'd been going through with Brandi's father - she didn't suspect drugs.

'A lot of parents who go through this, you enter this place of denial,' 
she said. 'You know something's off, but then they can look at you and 
say, 'You're crazy, Mom. I'm fine,' and you believe that. Denial in 
itself is very wicked.'

In September of 2009, Meshad's parents made her take a drug test. They were shocked when she tested positive for opiates and Xanax.

Sasha: The character of Sasha in Dale's short film is based on Brandi and shows the horrors of addiction

'We were just shocked,' her mother said. 'Teens have this idea that prescription drugs are safer because you don't think your parents or the police can tell, but the danger is that these drugs can kill you on your first try. There's no recreational oxy user.'

Lisa Meshad has used the tragedy of losing her daughter to spread the word about the dangers of prescription pain medication, as well as lobbied the Florida Legislature for stricter laws about prescription pain medication.

'We don't have a recovery story, but we want others to have it,' Lisa Meshad said.

Dale's film focuses on a girl named 'Sasha.' There are many differences between the character of Sasha and Brandi Meshad - Sasha injects her drugs while Brandi typically snorts hers - but the story of the pain caused by addiction is representative of many stories in southern Florida.

'I don't think anyone who grew up in Sarasota could avoid having friends
 or people they know who start to develop problems with opiates and 
other drugs,' the film's cinematographer, Sebastian Baron, told the Herald-Tribune.

Lisa Meshad has seen the movie.

'[After watching the movie] I immediately wrote [Dale] and told him I was speechless,' Lisa said. 'I 
think in a beautiful way it really showed how quickly a beautiful life 
can end.'

However, she says, the fight against addiction is often a losing battle.

'I think in Sarasota we've done an incredible job of raising 
awareness and doing something about the pill mills,' Lisa said. 'But do I
 think it's changed the number of people of all ages who are addicted? 
No.'
