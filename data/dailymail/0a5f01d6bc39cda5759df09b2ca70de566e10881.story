She's best known for solving complex mathematical problems on Channel Four's cult show Countdown.

And now Rachel Riley has turned her brilliant mind to figuring out something we all want to know - who will win this summer's World Cup.

The Manchester United fanatic and Oxford graduate has been poring over all the data from World Cups down the years to try and pinpoint the patterns that will tell us which team will lift the famous trophy in the Maracana on July 13.

World Cup tips: Countdown presenter Rachel Riley has crunched the data ahead of the big kick-off in Brazil and tipped Chile as the winner

Heading for glory? Chile are the fancied team after Rachel's calculations, which took into account dozens of different factors

And, in an outcome that may raise a few eyebrows, all the statistics point to outsiders Chile.

Commissioned by bookmaker Ladbrokes, Rachel took into account a diverse range of factors including goal average, goal scorers, win rates, climate and geography in a mathematical formula to try and find a winner.

She found that since the Mexico World Cup in 1986, performances in the qualifying competition have had a significant influence on the outcome of the tournament.

The key is not to peak too soon and to do just enough to qualify with a win rate of between 50 and 66 per cent.

It all adds up: A combination of Chile's win ratio, qualifying campaign and FIFA ranking suggests they will be dark horses in the finals

This is bad news for the likes of Germany and Holland, who raced through their qualifying groups and won 90 per cent of their games, and also Belgium (80 per cent) and defending champions Spain (75). Chile's qualifying win rate of 56 per cent is just about perfect.

The second biggest influence according to Rachel are the goal scoring averages. The previous seven world champions only averaged 2.1 goals per game through the qualifying rounds.

Unfortunately, this rules out England, who averaged over 3 goals a game in their 10 qualifying matches.

Relying on one star player is not the key to success either. Top scorers in previous World Cup winning teams scored an average of 4.85 goals during qualification.  

Place your bets: Rachel recommends you put your money on outsiders Chile to lift the trophy in the Maracana on July 13

Show your working: Rachel looked in detail at every tournament since 1986 in order to draw her conclusions

This time round, Luis Suarez scored 11 and Lionel Messi 10, knocking both Uruguay and Argentina out of the equation, but their South American neighbours Chile had Arturo Vidal and Eduardo Vargas on five goals each.

The fact no nation from outside Europe and South American has ever won the World Cup rules out a swath of teams. And no team with odds of 100-1 has ever prevailed either.

No European team has ever won on South American soil, removing France, Portugal and Italy from the mix, leaving Brazil, Colombia and Chile.

The next factor was that no pre-tournament favourites have lived up to their billing since 1986 and so Brazil - priced at 3-1 - aren't going to do it.

It now boils down to omens and human reasoning - Colombia have the easier group but are without star man Radamel Falcao.

Chile have the stronger squad and won 2-0 at Wembley against England back in November - 66 per cent of teams to do so at the new Wembley have been World Cup finalists.

Explaining her decision, Rachel said: 'Having crunched all the numbers and stats my maths suggests Chile are a good bet to upset the odds at 40/1.

'They might be amongst the outsiders, but the statistics and form imply they will be this year’s dark horses. They’ve got a decent team, and although it’s a tough group, they tick all the boxes and I’m convinced Chile can go all the way.

'Everyone thinks the winner will come from one of the top 10 teams, but the key stats on qualifying performance, goals scored, goalscorers, host nation and current outright odds suggest the likes of pre-tournament favourites Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany, Italy and France will be going home empty handed.

'As for England, I’ll be cheering on Roy’s Boys, but I’m not sure it’s going to be their year.'
