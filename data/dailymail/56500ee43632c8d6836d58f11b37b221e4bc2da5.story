Tragedies like the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated unless there is a revolution in the way the public sector deals with complaints, MPs warned last night.

A Commons committee found there was a culture of denial among managers in councils, schools and the health service – meaning they take little notice of criticism.

Their failure to listen is so bad that aggrieved members of the public simply believe there is no point in making complaints, MPs found.

The report from the Commons public administration select committee comes a week after England’s top health watchdog warned that tens of thousands of elderly people were ‘suffering in silence’ on NHS wards because they were too polite to ‘make a fuss’.

In an article for the Daily Mail, Dame Julie Mellor, the health service ombudsman, called for a ‘significant cultural shift’ in the way complaints are handled.

The MPs’ report also highlighted the failures that were exposed in the damning review by Robert Francis QC on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where up to 1,200 died amid appalling neglect.

It called on ministers to force a culture change across the public sector to prevent future tragedies.

Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ‘There needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run, and how the public perceives government.

‘As things are, most people believe  there is no point in complaining.  Unless and until we have a culture of leadership in public services that listens to, values and responds to complaints  from service users and staff, there will always be the potential for tragedies like Mid Staffs.’

The committee recommended a minister for complaints should be introduced, along with a dedicated unit to deal with grievances about government agencies. Its report, More Complaints Please, found public sector managers viewed complaints as ‘hostile criticism’ rather than a chance to tackle problems.

MPs called for a culture where complaints are valued and suggested the Cabinet Office work with high performing private sector companies to find the best ways of dealing with the issue.

The committee also attacked the public sector for using euphemistic words such as ‘feedback’ instead of ‘complaint’, saying they give the impression that concerns are not being taken on board.

Last night Dame Julie said: ‘The findings present an opportunity for organisations to deal more effectively with complaints and develop ways to learn from those mistakes.

‘Good complaint handling has to start from the top, and strong leaders will recognise the valuable opportunities complaints provide to really improve.’

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s essential for better public services that the Government makes it easier and more effective for people  to complain.

‘Giving people a single point of contact and having a minister who is responsible should give people more confidence that complaints do count.’
