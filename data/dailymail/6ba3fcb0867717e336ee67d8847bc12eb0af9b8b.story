Among the many tattoos on Danny Ings’s body is an inscription on the inside of his left forearm. It reads: ‘The difference between the impossible and possible lies in the man’s determination’.

It’s a quality the Burnley striker has drawn on more than any other to propel himself into the Premier League and, now it seems, to the brink of a move to Liverpool.

Just four years ago, Ings was playing for Dorchester Town in the Conference South on loan from Bournemouth. Even when he made a £1million move to Turf Moor from the South Coast in 2011, you could hardly say he was a star in the making.

Ings has netted seven times in the Premier League for Sean Dyche's Clarets this season

But Ings has been battling the odds ever since he was rejected by Southampton’s academy at the age of 10. At 15, when most Premier League hopefuls are well on their way through the system, he was playing for was his dad’s team Itchen Tyro in the Hampshire Sunday League.

Ings stuck at it, though, through dedication and sheer hard work. He has flourished at Burnley under Sean Dyche, scoring 26 goals in the club’s promotion campaign last season, and seven in the top-flight since returning from a hamstring injury in October.

Even that is not enough for the England Under-21 striker who has caught the attention of Roy Hodgson and now Brendan Rodgers.

‘Four years ago I was playing for Dorchester Town so it’s a dream come true for me,’ Ings told Sportsmail recently. ‘But it’s also a journey I don’t want to settle with. I want to carry on that journey and I want to improve to become the best I can be.

‘You always dream and have hopes but I think it all comes down to hard work. I have always grown being hard working. I have never known where I will end but all I could do was give myself the best opportunity by working as hard as I can.’

Dyche has nurtured Ings into one of the hottest prospects in English football over the last two years

Ings has recently set up a disability project in east Lancashire and enjoys a healthy relationship with the fans

It will be a wrench for Ings to leave Turf Moor, however. He has a great relationship with the fans and recently set up the Danny Ings Disability Project which aims to bring football coaching to disabled youngsters and those with learning difficulties. It will continue, he insists, even if he leaves the club.

The 22-year-old has also stayed on good terms with the club even though, privately, it has been acknowledged for some time that he will not be signing a new contract when his four-year deal ran out in the summer. Dyche even went to the lengths of publicly praising the player’s agent recently which is rare in these situations.

Ings' contribution to their Premier League survival fight is worth considerably more to them than the transfer fee.

If he leaves, they will be losing a good man. And Liverpool will get a striker who is determined to succeed.
