Labour MP Jim Dobbin died in September this year after drinking too many shots during an alcohol-fulled dinner while on a political trip in Poland 

MP Jim Dobbin died after drinking a huge quantity of shots during an alcohol-fuelled meal while on a political trip to Poland, an inquest has heard.

The stalwart Labour politician was at a banquet laid on as part of a Council of Europe trip to Slupsk when he was invited to drink a shot of spirit with every course.

The practice - said to be a Polish tradition - caused the 73-year-old to be five times over the legal drink-drive limit.

After the lavish evening meal, Mr Dobbin - a former microbiologist who had served an an MP since 1997 -  complained of feeling ill.

He went to bed after being told by colleagues to 'sleep it off'. 

But, when his wife Patricia was unable to wake her unconscious husband, she raised the alarm. 

The father-of-four, who also had eight grandchildren, was taken to hospital just after midnight on  September 7 last year, but died less than one hour after being admitted. 

The Council of Europe trip had been to mark the town being awarded the council's 2014 Europe Prize for 'promoting the European ideal'.  

Other British politicians on the trip included former Deputy PM John Prescott and Labour MP Alan Meale. 

At an inquest into his death in Rochdale, the court heard how Mr Dobbin had died with food in his lungs. He also had a blood alcohol level of 399mg per 100ml -the legal limit is 50mg.

The inquest heard how the MP, who represented Middleton and Heywood, never drank alcohol at home and only did so socially. When he did, he usually preferred beer rather than spirits.

But Mrs Dobbin, who had been married to Mr Dobbin for 50 years, told the hearing how her husband had been invited to consume a shot of Polish spirit with each course - a tradition which was apparently customary for the occasion - by their hosts.

Mrs Dobbin told how after the meal she went up to their room while her husband went to speak to Mr Meale.

She said: 'He saw the MP Alan Meale and said he wanted to go over to him – so I went upstairs back to the hotel room.

'While he was downstairs he told some friends he began to feel dizzy so they brought him upstairs to the room at around 10.30pm.

'Alan and two colleagues were with him and he (Jim) said "What's all this about?". His colleagues told him he just needed some sleep so I took off his tie and his shoes and was soon asleep.'  

During the inquest, Coroner Simon Nelson gave the cause of death was alcohol toxicity with food aspiration, which occurs when food blocks the body's respiration.

He also recorded a conclusion of death by misadventure.

Paying a warm tribute to Mr Dobbin, he said: 'When the Coroner's system was undergoing change a few years ago, he was one of a few MPs who responded to a letter I sent out – and when I met him I found him every bit as engaging as has been described.

'The area could not have wished for a more appropriate person to serve their needs.

'I believe he will be irreplaceable and I can't imagine any finer attributes than those described by those who knew him.' 

Mrs Dobbin added: 'He loved it (the visit to Poland) as he knew one or two people there who were involved with the pro-life movement as he was. He was having the perfect day.'

She added: 'He never stopped – he was always busy and after he died, I had 940 cards of sympathy from all over the world.

'He was very sociable and outgoing and everything he set out to achieve in life, he achieved.'

The MP, who had two daughters and two sons, was elected as a councillor to the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale council in 1983, where he became group leader in 1994.

He was also a committed Roman Catholic and was made a papal knight by Pope Benedict in 2008.

In parliament, Mr Dobbin chaired the Pro Life Committee and was also a member of the Involuntary Tranquillizer Addiction Group. He also sat on the Transport Scrutiny Select Committee.

Some of his key moments in parliament included calling for integrated healthcare for the developing world to help prevent diseases spreading and to improve sanitation.

He also voted against the same-sex marriage bill, commenting that MPs who voted for the change would 'rue the day' that they did so.  

Mr Dobbin was part of a delegation which had travelled to Slupsk (pictured) to mark the town being given the Council of Europe's 2014 Europe Prize for 'promoting the European ideal'

Mr Dobbin was the local MP for Fusilier Lee Rigby, the soldier who was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, last year.

He said at the time that the death had ‘absolutely traumatised’ people in Fusilier Rigby's home town of Middleton, Greater Manchester. 

Mr Dobbin, the son of a coal miner, was born in Kincardine, in Fife.

He went to Napier College, Edinburgh, where he studied bacteriology and virology, before working as a microbiologist for 33 years, 22 of which were for the Royal Oldham Hospital 

At the time of Mr Dobbin's death, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said it was a 'sad day for Parliament,' adding that Mr Dobbin was a 'dedicated public servant'.

He had said: 'I will miss Jim's good friendship and decency.

'On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Pat, and their children. We will all miss him.'
