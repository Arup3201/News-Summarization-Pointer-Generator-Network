South African Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba led the tributes to Nelson Mandela on Thursday night just hours after the Royal premiere of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.

Charlize, 38, said: 'My thoughts and love go out to the Mandela family. Rest
 in Peace Madiba. You will be missed, but your impact on this world will
 live forever,' adding: 'There will never be words to say what I'm 
feeling right now. I am saddened to the depths of my soul. Truly.'

Naomi Campbell, 43, told MailOnline, 'Nelson has stood as a figure of strength, hope, freedom, selflessness and love, and I join everyone across the world in mourning his passing.

'However, he was much more than just a figurehead to me - he was my mentor, my honorary grandfather, my Tata. Since meeting him in 1993, he's guided me and gave me a reason for being in the tough times of my life. He changed my perception of the world.'

the rest of the family.'

The Wire star Idris,

memory, not just reflect on how far we've come, but on how far we have 
to go.

with me and with all of us.'

Mr
 Weinstein, 61, who produced the movie starring Brits Idris and Skyfall star
Naomie Harris, told MailOnline: 'One of the privileges of making movies 
is having the opportunity to immortalize those who have made a profound 
impact on humanity.

'We count ourselves unspeakably 
fortunate to have been immersed in Nelson Mandela’s story and legacy. 
It’s been an honor to have been granted such proximity to a man who will
 go down as one of history’s greatest freedom fighters and advocates for
 justice.'

Queen guitarist Brian May, a founding ambassador of Nelson Mandela's 46664 charity, assisting those infected or affected by HIV/Aids, said: "Very sad to hear of Madiba's passing.

'We (Queen, along with Dave Stewart, and the Corrs) were privileged to spend some days and nights with him at his game park retreat, while we were organising the first 46664 concert for Aids at Green Point Stadium in Cape Town. They were life-changing days, with quiet time and talks around a camp fire at night, which we will remember till we die.

'Mandela was the most inspiring man of his generation. His message, by example, was the power of forgiveness. He showed us that it's possible to act after great injustice with no thought of revenge. He was light, funny, enormously generous, and, quietly, the greatest example to the world that a man can be.'

While some messages were short, others from celebrities were more detailed.

Actor Ryan Phillippe recalled meeting Nelson Mandela with his daughter Ava over ten years ago.

The 39-year-old actor wrote: 'The privilege of spending a small amount of private time w/ Mr. Mandela as he held my baby daughter, is a highlight of my life. Mandela was bouncing Ava, then two yrs old, on his knee & called her, “future leader”. I couldn’t believe it in that moment. I still can’t.'
