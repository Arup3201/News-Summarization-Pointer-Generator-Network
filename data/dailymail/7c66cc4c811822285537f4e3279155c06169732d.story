Celtic were left enraged last night after top signing target Stefan Scepovic staged a last-minute U-turn over his planned move to Glasgow.

The Serbian international passed a medical in Madrid yesterday – and had already secured a work permit allowing him to complete the £2.2million switch from Sporting Gijon.

Despite also having agreed personal terms on a four-year contract with the Celtic Park hierarchy, however, Scepovic broke the news that he wouldn’t be closing the deal.

No deal: Stefan Scepovic has performed a dramatic U-turn on his move to Celtic 

The dramatic twist on the eve of deadline day leaves Ronny Deila with limited room for manoeuvre before the summer transfer window shuts at 11pm tonight.

Sportsmail understands the Celtic manager and club officials were left disgusted by Scepovic’s attitude to the deal, with talk of multiple agents and a last-minute move by Getafe blamed for pulling the plug.

Club insiders dismissed any talk of the 24-year-old’s change of heart coming because of their Champions League exit, pointing out that he had willingly gone through all the necessarily immigration procedures and a lengthy medical several days after the play-off loss to Maribor.
