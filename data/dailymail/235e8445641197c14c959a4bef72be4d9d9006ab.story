What was she thinking: Investigations are underway to see what caused Miriam Carey, 34, to go on her dangerous drive

The sisters of the woman who was shot to death by police officers after ramming her car into a White House barricade have spoken out about how she was a 'vibrant woman and had a lot of dreams and aspirations'.

Miriam Carey, 34, was killed on Thursday after she slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she had her young daughter in the backseat.

'She was fun, she was loving. She was filled with dreams for her new daughter,' Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones said during an exclusive interview with CNN.

'We don't know what happened.

'We're still trying to put the pieces together. It's very sudden. It still doesn't seem real. We're still waiting for the real story.'

The investigation into the use of 
force by the Capitol police and the metropolitan police during the 
shooting is underway, and the sisters say that may prove one area where 
they can get some closure on their unanswered questions.

'Was there some other way that she could have been helped so that it didn’t end tragically?' the woman's sister Amy Carey-Jones asked.

'Personally, I feel that as professionals there has to be another way other than shooting and killing an individual.'

Since the shooting, police have revealed that Miriam suffered from post-partum depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose name has not been released.

Speaking out: Miriam Carey's sisters- Valerie Carey (left) and Amy Carey-Jones- held a press conference near Amy's home in Brooklyn on Friday

Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase

Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression

Her sisters have spoken out about the 
wide-ranging claims about Miriam's mental state, saying that while she 
had mental issues in the past, they were under the belief that it was 
under control.

‘I didn’t 
know she was in DC. I was on my way to work- the call was very sudden,’ 
Amy said, telling Anderson Cooper how her first reaction was ‘“That 
could not have been my sister.”’

'I immediately went to the television to see what was being reported… I did recognize the car. It just didn’t seem real.'

After searching Miriam's Stamford, 
Connecticut home, police found files confirming her former mental 
diagnosis, though the clearest reports come from the interview with the 
victim's sisters.  

The people who knew; Miriam's sister Amy Carey-Jones spoke to Anderson Cooper about the doctor's decision to taper her off medication he had prescribed for post-partum depression

'My 
sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why
she was in DC. Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not 
have ended there,' Valery Carey, one of Miriam's sisters, told CNN.

Amy
described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored 
by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication 
for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior 
issues.

'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said.

'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication.

'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable.

Questions: Sisters Valerie (left) and Amy (right) said that there is no clear reason why Miriam drove down to DC where she met her death on Thursday

'There (were) not moments of her walking around with delusions- that's not what was going on.

'She
had her challenges as a new parent and I always spoke closely with 
her,’ Amy said, describing those challenges as ‘nothing out of the 
ordinary’.

'She seemed to be overwhelmed.'

The
biggest question- why she did it- will be one that remains with family 
members for the rest of their lives as Valerie Carey said that 'she was a
law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda'.

'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' her sister Amy said.

Miriam's boyfriend has told investigators that she feared her house was under surveillance by President Obama, though her sisters dispute that theory.

'What I can say is she has never disclosed of anything of that nature and since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable,' Valerie told Anderson Cooper during the Friday interview.
