An Indonesian man whose body is covered by hundreds of tumours has made a final plea for help as the rare condition robs him of his sight.

Slamet, from East Java, is believed to be suffering from neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition which causes uncontrollable growths along the nerves.

According to his brother Suwadi, the 59-year-old had a tumour removed from his waist in 1991.

Desperate: A man whose body has been disfigured by hundreds of tumours has made a final plea for help as the rare condition robs him of his sight

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious

But six months later tumours began to form all over his face and body.

Years later the condition has become intolerable and Slamet suffers constant pain throughout his body.

Recently the tumours have started blocking his nostrils, making it difficult for him to breath.

Neurofibromatosis is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps.

Although
 many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their 
parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation 
before they are born.

In November a photo of Vinicio Riva, who also has neurofibromatosis, spread across the world when he was warmly embraced by Pope Francis at one of the pontiff's weekly audiences in St Peter's Square.

Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome

Slamet is 
believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the
 name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps.

Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of 
their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a 
gene mutation before they are born.

There
 are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type 
one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. 

Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious.

The
 condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name 
given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured.

However,
 in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had 
Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms 
such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head.

The
 confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had
 suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and 
Proteus syndrome.

However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive.

Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin.

These
 harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many 
people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a 
centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. 

NF1
 is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop 
gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary 
considerably from person to person.

People
 with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and 
behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral 
nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1
 over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved 
spine.
