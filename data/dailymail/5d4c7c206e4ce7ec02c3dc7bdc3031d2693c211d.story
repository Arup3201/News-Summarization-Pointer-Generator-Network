A Cape Cod beach was shut down on Sunday morning due to a shark sighting off the coast.

A senior lifeguard spotted a dorsal fin about 150 yards off Nauset Beach in Orleans at 10:15 a.m today which looked like a great white.

In a 2013 summer first, the beach was shut down and swimmers were ordered out of the water. Other beaches in the area were also notified.

Sighting: Nauset Beach is open again after being closed for an hour this morning following the sighting of what officials say is a 12-13 foot great white shark 150 yards off the beach and heading south to Chatham

Orleans Harbormaster Dawson Farber told the Cape Cod Times that the shape and color of the dorsal fin led the lifeguard to believe that it was indeed a great white shark, which are slowly returning to the Cape Cod area to feed as the seal population increases.

'You can understand why they’re here,' Farber told CBS Boston, adding there are tens of thousands of seals in the harbor right now.

Lifeguards estimate the shark was between 12 and 13 feet long.

On May 28, state officials confirmed the first great white shark sighting of the summer season off Cape Cod.

The 13-foot female, which had been tagged with a transmitter by Massachusetts scientists two years earlier, was detected off Monomoy Island near Chatham.

Greg Skomal, a scientist at the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries, said Nauset Beach was reopened about an hour after the sighting.

'It's that increase in the gray seal population that we've seen over the last four decades that's now drawing these sharks closer to shore. The café is open and these sharks have come here to feed,' Skomal told WCBV.

Meanwhile, at an actual Cape Cod café, patrons seemed unconcerned by the sighting.

'I’ve had hundreds of people here at the restaurant today and not one has expressed fear of the sharks being out there today,' owner of Liam's Cafe at Nauset Beach John Oman told CBS Boston.

'There are a lot of people down here, a lot are taking pictures of the newly constructed beware of the sharks sign,' he said.

The beach was reopened at 11:15 am, following state protocol that the beach be shut down for one hour pending further shark sighting.
