The owner of a $300,000 Lamborghini who parked in a disabled spot at a camping store has apologised and made a 'substantial' donation to charity after being called out on social media.

The bright orange sports car was photographed in a clearly-marked disabled spot outside the BCF store in Joondalup, north Perth, and the image posted to the Facebook page Australian Disability Parking Wall of Shame.

The outraged reaction online promoted the man to own up and make a donation to the Centre for Cerebral Palsy.

He told the charity has paid the price for his mistake and is remorseful for his actions.

'I'm extremely sorry for my actions, I know I've done the wrong thing,' the centre quoted the man, whose identity was not revealed, as saying.

'Showing other people respect is incredibly important to me, and on this occasion I failed to do this,' he added.

One posted a picture of a p-plater parked in front of KFC in Queensland: 'Young teen at schoolies sat inside KFC for 40 minutes while parked there not caring and laughing about it all'

'I hope this donation will go some way towards making a positive impact on an individual's life; for me it's not about the money but showing respect for other people.'

The charity did not disclose the amount of the donation, but said it was 'considerable' and would go towards supporting individuals with disability and their families who access the centre's services.

The Perth businessman is not the first driver to be named and shamed by the Facebook group.

Hundreds more examples of drivers who have parked without a permit are also posted on the page.

Angry drivers have posted photos ranging from shoppers taking up two disable spots to non-permits parked outside of fast food chains and shopping malls.

One photo shows a man casually drinking and standing outside his parked Peugeot car in a disable spot, while a few others taking up two spots outside shopping malls.

Adding to the so called 'wall of shame,' people are also using disable spots to 'sell their vehicle' as one user said: 'This van has been parked in a disabled space in Haymarket Sydney for well over a month.

'It does have a valid disabled permit in the window, its allowed to sit there indefinitely and take up a parking space that no-one else can use. The council has told me there's nothing at all that they can do about it. Makes me kinda angry though...'

An anonymous member said: 'My father-in-law has contacted centre management, local council etc and still no action has been taken. This was first bought to our attention last Tuesday when my wheelchair dependent mother-in-law wanted to shop at Millers in the new centre.'

Another user added she had a child with autism, which entitles her family to use a pass when she's with them.

Sara Hassan posted: 'One had the audacity to yell that my daughter didn't look 'disabled enough' to be entitled to one. We need to educate the public that a perfectly 'normal' looking person can still have a handicap that entitles them to having a pass.'

Thousands of Australians have taken to the 'name and shame' page to post photographs of drivers who park in disability parking bays without permits

Despite all the awareness for parking to help people with disability, one user also suggested that another page should be considered for 'people who use the disabled toilet facilities who shouldn't.'

Wendy Cramley posted on the page: 'I was at Warringah Mall shopping centre and had to wait for 10 minutes before some guy came out. When I told him that it was a disabled toilet he said that he "couldn't care less because it suited him to use the bigger toilet and that I should go f**k myself."
