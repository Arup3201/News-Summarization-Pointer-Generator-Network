Barack Obama made a point of shaking hands with every one of the medical workers gathered for a White House photo-op today as he hailed the work of Ebola-exposed health care professionals.

The president thanked the 'hero' doctors and nurses for their work in West Africa and insisted that they must be treated with dignity and respect. He conceded, though, that Americans will 'likely see more cases' of the disease, which kills more than half of those diagnosed.

A series of controversies have erupted, most visibly in New Jersey, surrounding the difficult question of whether Americans who work with Ebola patients overseas should be forcibly quarantined upon their return.

Obama said he was 'a little frustrated' by 'people talking about American leadership' but then 'running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers' when Ebola emerges - an apparent dig at New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie.

Quarantines for Ebola typically last 21 days, the length of the disease's incubation period. Some of Obama's guests were still within that time-frame, meaning that they could possibly be harboring the virus without yet showing any outward symptoms.

In touch: President Obama shakes hands with an unidentified medical worker at a White House reception for healthcare professionals who have been working to tackle Ebola in West Africa 

Safe to embrace: Dr. Ken Brantly, who has been medically cleared as Ebola-free, got a presidential handshake

It was unclear which of the doctors and nurses were within the 21-day period, but he shook hands with all of them.

Ebola can be spread through contact with bodily fluids, including sweat. Human hands are the body parts that sweat the most.

Obama said Americans 'can't hermetically seal ourselves off' from the world in the fight against Ebola. Discouraging their work with restrictive measures that confine them upon their return, he added, would be a bad policy.

'We will contain and eventually snuff out this outbreak,' the president pledged. 'We don't run and hide when there is a problem.'

He didn't name any particular states, governors or policies, but his point was understood as a jab at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose statewide quarantine mandate goes far beyond what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers necessary. 

The New Jersey leader has been at the center of a row over the treatment of Kaci Hickoc, who was put into quarantine after arriving at Newark Airport and who claimed she was being mistreated by being detained.

Obama also embraced Kenneth Brantly, a U.S. doctor who was treated for Ebola but has since been declared free of the viral infection. 

His remarks came in the East Room of the White House. Some of the health care workers have already been in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, where the disease has killed more than 5,000. Others will soon go there.

The president paid tribute to the health care workers 'on the front line in West Africa'.

'We need to call them what they are,' he said: 'American heroes' who show 'what is possible when America leads'.

Obama cited an improvement in the mood of Ebola-stricken countries as an example of 'American exceptionalism'.

Moments later he complained about policies that might make health care workers reconsider braving the inconveniences associated with traveling to fight Ebola.

FOUND! White House Ebola Response Coordinator Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents whose lack of a medical background has made him a political punching bag, attended the photo-op

'We are at our best when we are standing up and taking responsibility,' Obama said. 'Making sacrifices especially when it requires sacrifices.'

'That's how we help others around the world ... It's not just massive deployments of troops and equipment. As proud as we are of that, it's also our skill and compassion and painstaking effort and our ability to learn from mistakes that are made, and our ability to work through problems that are complicated.'

'And to see something through. And not lose our heads. To have grace under pressure. And apply ourselves with slow, steady effort. The kind that change and progress requires. That's what I want to see from us, the pride of a nation that steps up to get the job done.' 

'Ebola czar' Ronald Klain, the Democratic Party operative tapped to coordinate what the White House calls a 'whole of government response' to the Ebola crisis, was in attendance on Wednesday but said nothing publicly.

Klain's absence from public view has led to charges that the White House isn't as serious about combating the public health threat as it is about managing the political risks just days before an election. 

D.C. pundits have joked about the 'Where's Waldo'-style parlor game involved with spotting the all-but-invisible Klain. 

The White House says he spoke with the president on six of his first seven days on the job.

DEFIANT CHRIS CHRISTIE TO NURSE WHO MAY SUE HIM OVER EBOLA QUARANTINE: 'WHATEVER, GET IN LINE.'

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blew off on Tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for Ebola.

Speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse, Kaci Hickox, Christie said, 'Whatever. Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before.

'Get in line. I'm happy to take it on,' he added, according to CNN.

Christie disputed the nurse's claims that she was mistreated and pointed out that the tent she was confined to was indoors, not outdoors, as early reports claimed.

'There's been all kinds of malarkey...about this,' Christie told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in Rhode Island.

'She was inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cell phone, access to the internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark,' he said.

Christie has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep Hickox in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for Ebola.

Attorney Steven Hyman speaks to his client, quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox, at the isolation tent at University Hospital in Newark, N.J., where Hickox was confined after flying into Newark Liberty International Airport

Abrupt: Chris Christie had a brief and pointed response when he was asked about the potential for Kaci Hockox to sue: 'Whatever. Get in line.' He added that she had been well-treated and disputed her claim she was in a hospital car park 

The nurse came from West Africa by way of a New Jersey airport last week. She found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of Ebola.

But even after the nurse's fever subsided, health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet.

She has obtained a high-powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit. The lawyer, Norman Siegel, told Reuters on Sunday that Hickox's quarantine raised 'serious constitutional and civil liberties issues.'

The New Jersey government has since allowed Hickox to return to her home in Maine.

Christie, a possible, 2016 presidential candidate, has denied that her release was an about-face, however.

He has also refused to rescind the state's new policy requiring health workers returning from West Africa to self-quarantine at home for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola.

On Tuesday he maintained that he didn't think he'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she didn't have Ebola.

'We're trying to be careful here,' Christie said on NBC's Today show. 'This is common sense, and ... the American public believes it is common sense. And we're not moving an inch. Our policy hasn't changed, and our policy will not change.'

At the campaign event later that day Christie pointed out that the Centers for Disease and Control staff who were 'on the ground in University Hospital monitoring the conditions she was in' didn't think the state treated Hickox unfairly, either.

'She had access to the Internet and we brought her takeout food,' he said.

Pouncing on Christie's comment, Gawker called some of Newark's 'finest' takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to Hickox - or at least not to the restaurants' knowledge.

As Christie noted New Jersey officials brought Hickox the food, so takeout restaurants may not have been aware they were feeding the Ebola patient.
