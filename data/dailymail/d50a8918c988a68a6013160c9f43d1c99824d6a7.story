Paul Jenkins, 35, from Caerau, south Wales, was jailed for 15 months after crashing into a mother-of-three while she called a taxi from the pavement

A mother was left fighting for her life after being hit by a schizophrenic motorist who claimed voices in his head told him to drink-drive.

Paul Jenkins, 35, was driving while over the legal drink-drive limit in Maesteg, south Wales, when he swerved into 47-year-old Karen Tatchell, while she was standing on the pavement calling a taxi.

Despite throwing Mrs Tatchell into the air, Jenkins failed to stop.

He left the victim lying helpless on the ground outside the Llynfi Coach House, while her husband Huw was still inside.

Jenkins, who had denied driving 
dangerously, said he thought he might have been fiddling with 
the car stereo when his car mounted the pavement.

During the trial, he told the court: 'I didn’t see them - I’m devastated. I didn’t know I had hit anyone.'

But Cardiff Crown Court heard Jenkins, who lives with his parents in Caerau, later claimed in a psychiatric report that voices had 
told him to drive home after drinking.

Defence
 barrister Tim Evans said Jenkins - who had a previous conviction for drink-driving - was diagnosed with schizophrenia some years
 ago and his mental health had deteriorated recently.

Recorder Jeremy Jenkins said it was 'worrying' that 'voices' were apparently instrumental in what happened.

Jenkins was jailed for 15 months after 
being convicted of driving dangerously, being over the limit and failing
 to stop after the accident.

The court heard that, after the crash, he was found by police in his flat a couple of streets away, watching TV in his bedroom.

They tracked him down after finding a broken wing mirror and matching it to the dark-coloured car in which Jenkins was driving.

Meanwhile, the mother-of-three was left in a coma and still suffers problems with her memory.

Home carer Gillian Fencott of Nantyffyllon told the court: 'My husband John was on my left and Karen in front of me and it happened so quick.

'I saw a car and next minute it mounted the kerb and they were both on the floor. I’d heard a ‘bang.... bang’ as they were hit. The car went on, swerving.'

Karen Tatchell, 47, was left lying helpless on the ground after Jenkins failed to stop at the scene. She spent 'considerable time' in a coma and still suffers from memory problems

Witness Nicola Thomas said Mrs Tatchell had been calling for a taxi at the time.

She said: 'I suddenly saw John going up in the air and landing right in front of me. I didn’t see it hit her but she was on the floor and John was trying to get up to help her.'

Mrs Thomas’ daughter Jessica added: 'I saw a dark car coming down then up on to the pavement. It hit her, she went up and came down on her side.'

The recorder told him: 'You made a conscious decision to drive home that night knowing you had been drinking and suspecting you might be over the limit.

Recorder Jeremy Jenkins at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured above, said it was 'worrying' that 'voices' were apparently instrumental in what happned

'You told the jury you were driving slowly because of it and have (since) said voices told you to drive.

'While I accept you have a long-standing mental illness, the consequence of your decision was that you mounted the kerb outside the Llynfi Coach House and careered into a number of pedestrians who were chatting after an evening out and waiting for their taxis.

'Karen Tatchell was thrown in the air and was in a coma for a considerable time and still has long-lasting difficulties.

The crash took place outside the Llynfi Coach House in Maesteg, pictured above, while Mrs Tatchell's husband Huw was still inside

'This is a serious case of its kind and had the offence been committed just a few months later (following new legislation), you would be facing a much longer sentence.'

The maximum term, at that time, of two years, was reduced to 'reflect Jenkins’ illness' and a copy of his psychiatric report was ordered to go to prison with him.

Jenkins was described as vulnerable and someone who would 
find prison difficult.

He was banned from driving for five years.
