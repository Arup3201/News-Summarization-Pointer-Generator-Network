Now if you're going to get sick, please can you try to plan it well in advance, preferably before 5pm, Monday to Friday?

In the modern NHS (which should be renamed care Not Holidays, Saturday or Sundays) getting to see our local GP at a time when it suits us rather than them has become a pipe-dream, like finding a parking space you don't have to pay for by mobile phone, or bagging a trolley at the supermarket when you haven't got a pound coin.

A & E departments are in meltdown, swamped with an extra million people a year (compared with three years ago). They can't see their local doctor since new contracts in 2004 gave them a 45 per cent pay increase and allowed GPs to opt out of working unsocial hours.

cent of doctor's surgeries in England are not open when it is 
convenient for patients - but what have they done about it? Nothing'

Worse, after sitting patiently in a queue in casualty for hours in the evening or weekend, there's a one in five chance the person who sees you will be a junior doctor with just a few months' experience.

Many have not been long in the UK, are on short-term contracts, have limited English, and certainly no knowledge of any of your family history.

Many consultants and senior doctors, like GPs, don't work at night. Millions of us have lost faith in out-of-hours helplines, run by private companies who use nurses instead of doctors, and would rather take pot luck at  hospital instead.

The Health Department reckons that 93 per cent of doctor's surgeries in England are not open when it is convenient for patients - but what have they done about it? Nothing.

The Care Quality Commission says emergency wards can't cope. The body which represents A & E doctors agrees.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt blames GPs.

But even when you are lucky enough get to see your family doctor, in the over-stretched, reconfigured cost-efficient NHS, it's a dispiriting experience.

First, they hardly look at you, and stare at their computer screen. They spend your precious few minutes of face-to-face time typing in information and reading stuff online.

When you have blood tests you have to ring up a couple of days later and speak to the over-worked receptionist, who will tell you if the results are normal or not. That's a medically unqualified secretary who has a line of patients waiting for appointments and prescriptions standing right in front of her.

If you require a follow-up appointment, then you will have to go through the ridiculous procedure of bagging a convenient slot all over again.

Recently, my arthritis medication was altered, and the new drug requires blood tests for three months, but I was told they couldn't be put in my diary now as the surgery doesn't work that far in advance!

When I asked for a printout of my last blood tests, I was told I couldn't obtain them online as so many were done every day. I have been given a password to log in and order repeat prescriptions, but I can't communicate directly with my doctor online about changing anything. This is half-baked: either you use the internet properly as a service to patients, or not.

A friend was worried that the whites of her eyes looked slightly yellow, which could mean - although she felt ok - she was suffering from a serious liver complaint, or hepatitis.

She waited days for her appointment, and then was disgusted when the GP (whom she'd never seen before) looked up ‘yellow eyes' on Google in front of her!

Recently, Mike Farrar, head of the NHS Confederation, told a committee of MPs that he thought patients should email their doctors with their symptoms to free up surgery time. Labour MP Valerie Vaz said: ‘I thought medicine was based  on observation.'

In fact, wouldn't doctors' surgeries run better if we just Googled our own symptoms and sent an email to the GP for a second opinion? (Only joking).

Another sign that patients are regarded as stumbling blocks to efficiency is a controversial policy document on the Conservative Policy Forum website, an organisation chaired by Oliver Letwin and backed by party co-chairman Grant Shapps, which asks party  activists to vote on various proposals to make the NHS more 'efficient'.

To my horror, they ask if it's a good or bad idea to limit the number of visits we can make to GPs in a year, and whether appointments at weekends and evenings are ‘a luxury the country cannot afford'. Another gem asks whether ‘families should take care of their infirm relatives'.

This website plays an important part in determining the Conservative Party manifesto - so you have been warned.

It's perfectly plain that the NHS of the future would run so much better without us, the annoying patients who clog up doctors' surgeries and A & E units.

Family doctors provide a service we pay for - increasingly, it's one that suits them, rather than their customers.

Oh Hell, it's Cara

Cara Delevingne says she wants to act

Bushy browed model of the moment Cara Delevingne turns up in Cannes (above) and announces, 'I want to act' - telling journalists she'd be happy to work with Tarantino, Spielberg, Scorsese or Luhrmann.

The joyous arrogance of a 20-year-old! I can't say I was any different, because when you are that age you can't see why you won't be able to achieve whatever you want in life.

Cara says she'd like to play 'a Dante'. I presume she means the medieval Italian poet, whose Divine Comedy - a journey from Hell to Purgatory and Paradise - has inspired artists and (more recently) a blockbuster by Dan Brown. Brown's latest opus, Inferno, has been described as 'bilge' and 'his worse book yet', but it  will still sell in  its millions.

I wonder which stage of the journey interests Cara. The fashion business might be Hell, and staying that thin Purgatory - but is she ready to face God in Paradise?

Having happening eyebrows doesn't necessarily mean you've got any acting ability. Carey Mulligan, one of the most talented young actresses in the world, has a uniquely mobile face that changes depending on her character.

Sadly, no matter what faces she pulls on Instagram snaps, Cara always looks exactly the same.

Can't we bank on the Co-Op anymore?

What's going wrong at the once-reliable  Co-op? The head of finance has been forced to resign after the banking arm of the group dramatically halted plans to buy 632 branches of Lloyds last month.

The Government was keen on the sale because it wants to break the dominance of the four major lenders in the High Street.

To add to their woes, the Co-op's banking boss left two weeks after a major credit agency slashed the company's credit rating, causing customers to panic.

Steve Humes, the group finance director who has just resigned, had no experience in  banking, but had been promoted from the  food division.

Is the Co-op trying to do too much? My local branch in Masham, North Yorkshire, recently moved into a brand new building. It's bigger than their old place, but seems to sell less.

The other day they ran out of potatoes. There were hardly any vegetables and little fruit. I was told ‘there hasn't been a delivery' -  everything comes from a depot.

The Co-op supports Fairtrade, but do they source local suppliers?

Will Mrs Polanski give him a little ticking off?

Roman Polanski and Emmanuelle Seigner

Roman Polanski has not visited the  U.S. since fleeing the country in 1978 after being arrested and charged with having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The film director has mostly been based in France, avoiding countries which might  extradite him.

Like many outside the rarefied world of luvvies, I find his failure to confront his past repellent, so why do his inane views about women get so much publicity?

Promoting his latest film in Cannes, which stars his beautiful wife Emmanuelle Seigner (both pictured), Polanski announced that the availability of the Pill had ‘masculinised’ women, and he regretted sexual equality, saying: ‘Trying to level the genders is purely idiotic.’

Seigner is 33 years younger than Polanski, and they have two children. Wisely, she kept her mouth shut during her husband’s comments, but I hope that, back home, she might have enlightened her Neanderthal husband.
