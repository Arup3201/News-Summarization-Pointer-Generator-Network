A christian teacher claims she was forced out of a controversial Islamic school after being put under pressure to follow an extreme Muslim dress code.

Women employees at the Al-Madinah free school were ordered not just to wear the hijab – scarf – to cover their head, but to cover the entire body and not wear symbols of other faiths.

The 50-year-old teacher has revealed the full list of rules she was made to adhere to, condemning the school for being ‘more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children’s education first’.

The Derby school drew criticism last week for its policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms. Former teachers say reading fairy tales, playing musical instruments and singing are all banned.

Statement: The school, pictured, has posted a letter to parents on its website claiming no staff members have ever raised concerns about the dress code

The Christian teacher, who does not wish to be named, started work there when it opened as a multi-faith free school a year ago but left three months later after she felt the rules had become too ‘strict’.

She said she was told nothing about a dress code in her interview or contract, but a month after she started the dress code handbook was distributed.

She started by wearing a head scarf or small hat, but took it off after classes, for which she was reprimanded. Shortly after that she began being ‘hassled’ about the rest of her clothing and, on one occasion, was sent a text from the school saying it ‘insisted’ on a ‘modest dress code’.

She said she asked how her outfit – a business suit – was not modest and wrote to the head teacher saying she has always dressed in a professional manner.

‘The skirt was well below the knee and I wore thick black tights that covered my legs,’ she said.

The teacher has revealed how she was forced to resign after refusing to comply with a strict school dress code insisting all female staff wear hijabs regardless of their religion.

She said: 'It wasn’t until an 
induction session, just before the school opened, that female non-Muslim
 staff were told they must wear a head covering, which was not made 
clear at any time during my interview for the job or was part of any 
contract.

'I reluctantly 
complied and either wore a head scarf or small hat, but took it off when
 I wasn’t in the classroom, but for which I was reprimanded.

'Wearing the head covering was difficult for me because I am a Christian and had I known it was compulsory for non-Muslim staff I would never have accepted the position.'

The teacher, who does not want to be 
named, said she was even sent a text from the school saying it 'insisted
 on' a 'modest dress code. Full length dress or skirt acceptable'.

She said she asked how her outfit - a
 business suit - was not modest. 'The skirt was well below the knee and I
 wore thick black tights that covered my legs', she said.

The
 teacher told how she was offended at the suggestion her clothes were 
'immodest' and was left particularly angry after being was told to take 
instructions from two male teachers about what was considered 'modest'.

She said: 'I wrote back to the head pointed out that "in nearly 20 years in teaching, I have always dressed in a professional manner".'

She claims the dress code was issued in a handbook to staff in October 2012 - just one month after the school opened.

The book indicated that female staff should only have their faces and hands uncovered when in the school.

She said: 'In the interim, I had expressed my concerns to the school about being forced to wear Muslim dress but as there did not seem to be any leeway, I went on sick leave as advised by my union.

'The school then put me on "gardening leave" and I eventually left in December.

'I am extremely disappointed by my experience. The school seems to me more concerned about dress codes and not putting the children’s education first.

'I also objected to the school’s policy of sitting girls at the back of classrooms, to no avail. The reason given was that girls are allowed to look at boys but the boys are not allowed to look at the girls, but how can that be good for the children’s education?

'I am disappointed that the school does not appear to be the multi-faith school I was excited about joining. I felt oppressed, faced with prejudice and marginalised. I also missed opportunities to take other jobs because I accepted this one.

'I have written and spoken to the Department for Education to complain about what has been happening at the school, and specifically about my experience, and am awaiting a response.'

The Daily Mail revealed on Monday that, following a series of complaints, Ofsted inspectors are to be sent to Al-Madinah ‘within days’ to scrutinise the quality of teaching and leadership.

This follows reports last week that former head teacher Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned from his role after alleging he was ‘bullied and sidelined’ by members of the school’s trust, which is predominately Muslim.

Two months earlier the deputy head, Suzanne Sutherland also stepped down, allegedly citing similar reasons. The school strongly denies their claims.

Another former teacher who spoke anonymously to the Mail said the school ‘was like being in Pakistan’ adding: ‘Boys go and eat lunch first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go.’

And one woman interviewed for a position claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers.

The school declined to comment.

In a letter to parents published on the school's website, the interim Principle Dr G S Wilson said: 'There has been a suggestion that female members of staff are unhappy to wear a headscarf or hijab when they are on the school site. 

'In all our adverts, and whenever we interview candidates, we draw their attention to our dress code, which we have based on our interpretation of modesty within our unique Free School environment. To date, the school has not received a single concern from colleagues about this issue.

'It has also been suggested that girls are treated in a way that implies they are not equal to boys. This is totally wrong. In Primary, boys and girls have never been segregated either inside or outside the classroom.  

'In Secondary, girls are seated as a group, either at one side of the classroom, or alternately at the front or the back of the room, swapping over from time to time. Our intention is to respect both genders equally. These seating arrangements have been determined purely by practicalities such as the size of the classroom.'

It is already being investigated by the Education Funding Agency, from which it receives public money, over alleged irregularities over its grants. It has already been given £1.4 million and can expect to receive more to spend on a new building.

Now it is expected that officials from the Office for Standards in Education will inspect the school within days following the furore over the dress code claims and concerns by unions over the standards of education at the school.

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'These allegations are very worrying. We have already been investigating this school for other reasons.

'Ofsted was due to inspect it this term and after discussions will bring forward its inspection.

'The DfE will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to prevent religious intolerance or any breaking of the rules for free schools.'

Rules: The strict dress code issued to teachers at Al-Madinah School in Derby quotes the Quran (stock image pictured)

Al-Madinah is an Islamic Free school. 
Within the school we value and esteem our teachers and consider them to 
be strong role models for all of the students and representatives of the
 school with all external individuals and organisations.

We wish to 
create an Islamic environment within the school for the sake of the 
students and to cater for the sensitivities of the community.

Although 
some of the following points are not Islamically-binding upon all 
individuals except those who wish to adhere to the faith by choice, 
Al-Madinah School has adopted them as a code of dress for all teachers.

The code of dress for teachers has been 
adopted by the school and all teachers must adhere to it.

By signing the
 contract of employment with Al-Madinah school all employees agree to 
adhere to this policy.

1. Clothing must cover the entire body, only the hands, face and feet may remain visible.

2. The material must not be so thin that one can see through it.

3. The clothing must hang loose so that the shape of the body is not apparent.

4. The design of the clothing must not display any symbols of other faiths.

5. All clothing must be full sleeved and all lower body garments must be loose and covering to the ankles.

6. Skirts must be ankle length and must be loose and flowing.

7. Teachers should not wear overt jewellery or clothing accessories.

8. Wearing of the Niqab or Burqa during work hours is not permitted.

Allah has stated in the Quran that women
 must guard their modesty. 'Say to the believing women that they should 
lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display 
their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof.' 
(Quran: 24.31)

'Say to the believing man that they 
should lower their gaze and guard their modesty that will make for 
greater purity for them, and God is well acquainted with all they do.' 
(Quran:24.30)
