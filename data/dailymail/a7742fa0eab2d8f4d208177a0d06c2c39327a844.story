Petrol will drop below £1 a litre across the country within weeks, ministers predict as they increased demands on oil companies to pass on falling prices.

Treasury minister Danny Alexander told MailOnline latest falls in the global oil price should see average prices hit the £1 mark at the pumps.

And he called on drivers to use their buying power to put pressure on fuel firms refusing to respond.

New figures today showed the average petrol price in the last week was £1.06, the lowest since November 2009 and down 10p in just four months

New figures today showed the average petrol price in the last week was £1.06, the lowest since November 2009 and down 10p in just four months. Diesel is down to £1.14 per litre.

Mr Alexander today briefed the Cabinet on the latest Treasury forecasts, and the expectation that the price will hit £1 within less than a month.

While he welcomed the moves so fare from oil companies, he insisted they had still failed to pass on the full benefits of dramatic falls in the crude oil price.

He told MailOnline: ‘Looking at the petrol price at the moment there is more to go.

‘This came up at Cabinet this morning. I said that within the next few weeks we should be seeing petrol down to round about £1 a litre. That is what people should be expecting and pushing for.

‘We saw the price fall again to below $50 a barrel two to three weeks ago. So there’s a six week time lag before that gets passed through at the pumps, so there should be further cuts.

‘I will certainly be pressing the fuel retailers to make sure we continue to see the pass through.’

A small number of independent petrol stations have cut the price below £1, but to date none of the major supermarkets have gone that far.

Motoring groups predicted the £1 litre mark would be reached a month ago, but so far it has not happened.

Mr Alexander said pressure from the government, the media and the public was working.

But he ruled out a fall to as low as 90p per litre, unless there was another dramatic fall in the oi price.

‘On the basis of the oil price fall at the moment I wouldn’t see it going that far. I think if we can get to around £1 a litre that would be fair, but you know let’s see.’

In recent weeks he has written to bus companies, airlines and tour operators demanding they also reduce their prices.

But bus firms in particular complain that they bought their fuel in advance to protect themselves from rising costs, and are yet to see the benefit of falls.

Mr Alexander insisted the excuses were not good enough: ‘I think bus passengers are going to say well we should be seeing this passed on to us. I’m looking at the moment into is there anything more we can do in that area.

‘I’m trying to get to the bottom of what is the nature of this hedging. Clearly someone is making a lot of money out of this, I’d quite like to find out who it is and see what we can do to accelerate it.

‘When you see such a massive shift, I really do want to see that passed on to not just people who are filling up their car but people who are travelling by bus, people who are travelling by plane, people who are buying package holidays.’
