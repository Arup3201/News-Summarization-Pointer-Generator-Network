A man suffered thousands of pounds of damage to his car after taking it in to the garage to have a lightbulb replaced.

Ben Langley took his Vauxhall Insignia to a dealership's workshop in Beverley, Yorkshire two weeks ago - but during the simple servicing a mechanic started driving it with its bonnet still up.

The car crashed into a vehicle which had been elevated above the ground, causing the bonnet to bend back and smash into the windscreen and roof.

The father of two now says the garage has refused to restore the vehicle to its original state, and offered to pay just £4,000 to replace the car.

Mr Langley, 38, said he was waiting outside the workshop when he heard a loud bang and saw the damage which had been done.

'I couldn't believe what I was seeing,' he said. 'I jumped out of my seat and looked out - I could see my car and there was a car on top of it.

'There were people all over the place but they couldn't give me a decent explanation of what had happened, they said it must have stalled or something.

'The mechanic had driven it across the workshop with the bonnet up. It's obviously common practice, and on this occasion he was caught out.'

Collision: The car's bonnet was snapped off while the roof was dented, causing extensive damage

Shock: Mr Langley only took his car in to get a lightbulb changed at a supposed cost of £40

Mr Langley's car was left with its bonnet ripped off, a smashed windscreen and dents in the roof after the other vehicle seemingly fell from its ramp.

The fire brigade had to be called in to remove the Vauxhall Zafira from the bonnet of his car.

Mr Langley says he is worried that the vehicle could be unsafe to drive, and criticised the garage's offer to buy it for £4,000 as that would leave him out of pocket when he buys a replacement.

'They have offered to repair the car, but I'm not interested,' he said. 'They want to do a cut and shove job, and take off the damaged parts and weld new ones back on.

'I have got kids and I would not be comfortable driving my car with a welded roof.

'They want to buy it from me for £4,000, do the work and then put it on the forecourt and make a profit. I don't think I should have to suffer any loss.

'This has caused me and my family such huge anxiety and stress, simply because they're not willing to put their hand in their pocket.'

Anger: Mr Langley says he would refuse to accept the offer of repairs unless the car is restored to its original state

Dealership: Bosses at the garage in Beverley insist they are planning to repair the car fully

Mr Langley, a project manager from Wawne, said he chose the dealership because he felt it would give him greater peace of mind despite its relatively high prices.

He said he would have replaced the bulb himself if he had not been offered a free 'winter health check' as a follow-up from his last servicing.

He has now been provided with a courtesy car while his own vehicle is still damaged, and says he plans to keep it until the matter is resolved.

A spokesman for the dealership said: 'I can confirm Mr Langley's vehicle was involved in a minor collision during a routine repair in the workshop.

'Nobody was injured. We have apologised to Mr Langley and accepted our responsibility.

'We have given him the use of an Astra while we agree a proper remedy to this situation. The vehicle is easily repairable and we have offered to repair the vehicle at no cost.

'We are sympathetic to Mr Langley and continue to engage with him with a view to finding a mutually agreeable and reasonable solution.'
