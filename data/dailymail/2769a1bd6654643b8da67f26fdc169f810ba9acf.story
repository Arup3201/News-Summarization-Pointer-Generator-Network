Chris Coleman believes Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti needs to resolve the 'political' feud between Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo for the sake of their season.

The Wales manager is concerned that the turbulent situation at the Bernabeu may affect Bale as he tries to guide his nation to Euro 2016.

Real enter Sunday's Clasico trailing La Liga leaders Barcelona by one point having surrendered a lead of their own in recent weeks.

Relations have not always been too cordial between Bale and Ronaldo this season

Wales manager Chris Coleman has urged Real boss Carlo Ancelotti to solve the 'political' feud 

And even last weekend's 2-0 win over Levante was marked by Ronaldo histrionics after Bale scored on the rebound from one of his shots.

Coleman told the Sunday Mirror: 'I look at it as a Ronaldo v Bale thing because that is how it is being framed by some people over there.

'There are pictures of expressions Cristiano makes if Baley does not pass. I was there at the start of the season and I can tell you, hand on heart, there was no problem between the two of them.

'Carlo Ancelotti is a manager I have been so impressed with after spending time with him. He is perfect for the situation.

'He is getting stick, too. But he will look at it and if there is a problem with Cristiano he will deal with it in-house.

'Gareth was the most expensive player and he was signed by the president. so, there's a political side to this.'

Bale was signed in the summer of 2013 for a world record fee in the region of £85m, eclipsing the £80m Real paid for Ronaldo in 2009.

Both players scored in the final as Real defeated Atletico Madrid to win the Champions League last season.

Ronaldo, who was crowned World Player of the Year in January, has been in sensational form this season, with 41 goals and 21 assists in 39 matches. Bale has scored 16 times in 38 matches.
