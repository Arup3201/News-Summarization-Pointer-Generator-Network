When the Make-A-Wish foundation transformed San Francisco into Gotham City on Friday, many were moved by the elaborate performance to make a five-year-old cancer survivor feel like a superhero for the day.

Miles Scott of Siskiyou County, California was diagnosed with Leukemia when he was just 2-years-old, but his cancer recently went into remission after three long years of chemotherapy.

For his Make-A-Wish foundation wish, he asked to be a superhero for the day and the organization responded with an elaborate day full of crime-stopping as the 'Batkid'. While the foundation grants wishes approximately every 38 minutes, Miles' wish generated much more attention than usual.

Patricia Wilson, executive director of Make-A-Wish for the Greater Bay Area, explains just why Miles' story became so popular in a new video that gives a behind the scenes look at the Batkid wish.

'It got picked up by a blogger and just went viral and as a result the wish has taken on a life of its own,' Ms Wilson said.

Ms Wilson believes the boy's simple wish to be a superhero for a day was something a lot of people could identify with.

'I think this wish just really struck a chord with a lot of people. A lot of people remember from their childhood wanting to be a superhero and here he is battling leukemia and as far as I'm concerned every child with a life-threatening condition is a superhero to me,' she said.

While some Make-A-Wish foundation kids receive their wishes while in treatment, Miles' parents decided to wait until he was off of chemotherapy so he would have enough energy for his special day. It also gave him something to look forward to.

'During Miles' darkest moments of chemotherapy and being sick and hospital stays this was a distraction for him - to start thinking about when he was going to be Batman,' Ms Wilson said.

And the wait was certainly worth it. Ms Wilson says a really good indicator of a wish working, is seeing the parents' reaction.

'I know that it works when I look at the parents face. And I look at the joy that they receive,' she said.

On Friday, Mr and Mrs Scott were all smiles as they followed their son around on his day of crime-stopping.

Hundreds of people lined the streets and cheered as he emerged from the Batmobile - driven by an adult Batman - before freeing a damsel who had been tied to cable car tracks.

Bosh! The damsel in distress did not hold back her thanks

As she embraced him in thanks, he got a call that the Riddler was trying to rob a vault downtown, so headed to the Financial District and promptly stopped the thief in his tracks.

News cameras captured the moment the Riddler was hauled from the bank and taken away by police officers.

After battling his enemy, he headed to Burger Bar to refuel, his Make-A-Wish itinerary explained.

While at Burger Bar, he received get a call on his batphone to go to the window where he saw a huge group of volunteers screaming for Batman’s help - because the Penguin was kidnapping a famous Gotham City mascot - Lou Seal.

Batman and Batkid raced to AT&T park to apprehend the villain and freed Lou Seal, the San Francisco Giants mascot since 1996.

After catching the Penguin, Batkid made his final stop at City Hall, where the Mayor and the Police Chief of Gotham City thanked him and gave him the key to the city.

Batkid was praised for his efforts, with Senator Dianne Feinstein tweeting: 'Thanks for saving Gotham, Batkid!'

Ahead of his heroic efforts, little Miles underwent acrobatic training with his 'Batman', inventor and acrobat Eric Johnston, to prepare him for his big day.

Johnston and his wife, Sue Graham Johnston, who played the damsel, even created Bat-style gadgets such as a wrist device that played previously recorded messages from San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr for Batkid throughout the day.

Johnston said of Batkid: 'He's an excellent superhero because he's a totally mild-mannered kid when the mask is off. But when he puts on the armored Batsuit, he's uncontainable. He shines.'

Around 1,000 special edition 'Gotham City Chronicle' newspapers were handed out at Union Square that day, with the headline: 'Batkid saves city.'

And even the illustrators for the original Batman are involved, after Andrew Farago, curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, reached out to cartoonists and DC Comics.

Generosity: Graham Nolan, an original illustrator of the Batman comics throughout the 1990s, drew this image of Batkid taking on Bane, adding at the bottom: 'For Miles - a real superhero!'

The boy behind the mask: Miles had told the Make A Wish Foundation that he wanted to be Batkid

Graham Nolan, who drew the Batman series through the 1990s and co-creator of the villain, Bane, was the first to respond - and sent through a drawing showing Miles as Batkid fighting Bane.

Nolan signed it: 'For Miles, a real superhero!'

'We certainly all were children who had dreams of being a superhero and being larger than life,' Farago told the Mercury News.

'But I think this has touched people because most of us have never had to overcome the obstacles that this boy has.'

While the day of saving damsels in distress and capturing the Riddler was no doubt great fun for Miles, it is also an important day for his family.

'This wish has meant closure for our family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son's body,' said his mother Natalie, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to give them hope.

Other incredible wishes it has granted include Justin Bieber meeting eight-year-old Annalysha Brown-Rafanan, who suffers from a life-threatening liver condition, and 11-year-old Tyler Sue, who has a serious genetic condition, meeting her 'Cake Boss' idol, Buddy Valastro.
