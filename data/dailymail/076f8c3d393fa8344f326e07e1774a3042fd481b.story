Even though she followed a gruelling diet to shed more than 7st in a year, Dawn French admits she is happier now she has piled on the pounds again.

The comedienne, 55, went on a strict regime that included cutting out chocolate and carbohydrates after her 25-year marriage to Lenny Henry ended in 2010.

But she has recently put 2st back on – and says she feels more dignified and ‘in control’. ‘If you’ve got the gift of a bit of extra heft, use it,’ Miss French told Australia’s New Idea magazine.

‘I’d like to decide what you may find funny about my fatness. For me there’s a dignity in that.

‘I don’t need you to be laughing at my fatness in a cruel or bullying way. Luckily in my life I’ve never experienced that, but I know that other big women do and don’t like it at all. I’ve always wrestled that into my control.’

Miss French, who is to star with James Corden in the BBC2 comedy The Wrong Mans, was 19st at her heaviest. She blames her recent weight gain on a weakness for bread, pasta and potatoes.

‘I had ballooned a bit more than I wanted to. I want to be there for my kid,’ she added.

The Vicar Of Dibley actress, who began 
dating twice-married charity executive Mark Bignell, 49, last year, has 
ruled out any more diets in the future, saying she has come to terms 
with her figure.

‘I am perfectly happy with how I look and I always have been. I’ll 
always be a fat girl and I am happy with that,’ she said recently.

In interviews at the time she said that entering her fifties had made her more health conscious.

Miss French also explained that falling in love has given her a new lease of life, and suggested that she started to put the weight back on following a romantic trip to Paris with Mr Bignell.

‘Generally I eat much more healthily and I eat less, probably half as much as I did before,’ she said.

‘I am very fond of this body - it’s served me well and it’s never disappointed me.

‘I understand it, I know it and I even like it now it’s all saggy, it’s a mark of my journey this far.’

Mr Bignell, whom Miss French has described as a ‘remarkable man’, is chief executive of a Plymouth-based charity which helps drug and alcohol abusers reintegrate into society.
