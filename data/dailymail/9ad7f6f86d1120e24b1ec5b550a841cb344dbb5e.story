The Pope has many titles, such as The Holy See, the Vicar of Jesus Christ, the Pontiff and His Holiness, but now it appears he has one more - style icon.

The U.S. edition of men's style and lifestyle magazine Esquire has named Pope Francis as its Best Dressed Man of 2013.

The magazine admits the decision is 'unconventional' but claims his simple manner of dressing has 'signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church'.

Mark-Evan Blackman, assistant professor of menswear design at FIT, told the magazine: 'His mode of dressing really does reflect the mindset behind it.'

'I remember when John Paul II was buried in those opulent bright red shoes. When the current pope was elected and chose not to wear the red shoes I thought that was very reflective of his approach to being a person functioning in a role.'

The Pope has been lauded for his humility - on Maundy Thursday, he knelt to wash and kiss the feet of young offenders — two of them girls and one a Muslim - during an Easter visit to a youth detention centre. In July, he invited homeless people to dine with him in St Peter’s Square.

In August, he posed for a ‘papal selfie’ with a group of teenagers. A few weeks later, he put on a red clown’s nose to pose for comic photos with a newly-wed couple.

'Pope Francis understands that menswear is meant to express the character of the man wearing the clothes,' said Mary Lisa Gavenas, author of The Fairchild Encyclopedia of Menswear.

'No rapper-style popewear for him.'

Ann Pellegrini, Associate Professor of Performance Studies & Religious Studies at New York University told the magazine the simplicity of his garments 'offers a way to visibly display his theological and material concerns for the poor'.

Esquire's previous winners of the award have included film stars and musicians like OutKast's Andre 3000

Known since March 13 as Pope Francis, the spectacle-wearing 77-year-old was 2013’s most discussed human being, according to the Global Language Monitor’s annual survey of the internet.

The accolade lays bare his ability  to shape the news agenda and capture hearts and minds with a succession of charismatic speeches and colourful public gestures.

Earlier this month, Francis was named Time magazine’s 86th Person of the Year — an honour previously awarded to Churchill, the Queen, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy.
