A Thai man suspected of raping a 20-year-old British teacher, claims he had consensual sex with the woman while his friend watched after meeting her in a bar.

Pongpatana Porsoi, 26, was paraded before the press and made to reenact his movements during the alleged attack on a second floor walkway in the city of Nakorn Sri Thammarat in Southern Thailand.

The woman, who is from Fort William, Scotland, claims she was attacked by four men and raped by two of them as she walked home from a night out at around 3am on Friday.

Suspect: Pongpatana Porsoi, 26, wearing a stab vest to protect him, is led away by police in Thailand. He denies raping a 20-year-old British teacher claiming the sex had been consensual

She had previously accused the Thai 
police of treating her like 'some drunk idiot' and treating the attack 
as a joke. She was unable to positively identify Porsoi as one of the 
attackers.

Police reports yesterday quoted the 
manager of a restaurant, where the woman was refused admittance, as 
saying she was escorted to a room. A neighbour reportedly said that if 
she was being raped she would have heard her cries.

Porsoi claimed he spotted the woman 
in the early hours of February 15 at a bar and went to help 
her because she had sustained a knee wound. He then followed he up to the 
second floor.

Events: Porsoi, 26, was paraded before the press and made to reenact his movements during the alleged attack on a second floor walkway

Story: Porsoi claimed he spotted the woman in the early hours of February 15 at a bar and offered to help because she had sustained a knee wound

He said he had attempted to have sex 
with her twice and claimed she had not resisted his advances but kept 
repeating the words 'OK. Good'.

Police were able to trace Pongpat because recordings from a security camera showed he was following her.

The woman said she had been out with a
friend at a restaurant where she had drunk 'a few beers' before moving
on to a bar where she met another friend.

She said her memory of the evening was hazy but added she had a clear description of two of her attackers.

She said: 'I remember quite clearly what the two men who raped me looked like.

The alleged scene of the crime: Police comb the second-floor balcony of the building in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, where a British student was found weeping

'One was wearing a black T-shirt and 
the other was wearing a green khaki T-shirt, he had black hair and a gap
in his teeth or a tooth missing.

'They hit me in the face and on my 
head. There are bruises on my arms from where they held me down and my 
elbows and knees have been scraped.'

Allegations: The British student said she was gang-raped in Nakhon Si Thammarat, southern Thailand

Police probing the attack have said 
they are waiting for forensic reports from the hospital where she was 
treated while their enquiries continue.

But the woman has hit out at the way the authorities have dealt with her since the assault.

She said: 'I've given three 
statements to the police using two different interpreters, I feel like 
I'm going round in circles with them.

'They tell me one thing and then 
another, they've said something about a bouncer at the bar taking me 
home and dropping me off, but he can't remember where that was.'

She added: 'I still haven't received 
anything back from the police, or from the hospital for tests for 
diseases following the attack.

'How come no-one in nearby houses 
heard anything happening? I was screaming and shouting during the 
attack, there's no chance they never heard anything.

'The police have said the people 
living nearby just thought it was a fight and didn't do anything. The 
police and authorities are very humiliating, their whole system has let 
me down.

'They're making out that I was some drunk idiot and it was my fault, which was not the case.

Meanwhile he woman's mother rounded on Thai police and the press.

She said: 'The system there is so 
corrupt ...and if my daughter had been taken back to the flat there was 
another housemate there who wasn't aware (my daughter) was home.

'He would have heard her ...instead 
of theses ignorant people not listening to the screams of a young woman 
being attacked /raped.

'They go to the authorities and tell 
stories to make money to keep their country looking good and us Briton's
looking like drunken idiots.

Destination: Thailand is popular with British tourists, particularly students, with thousands visiting every year.

'She does admit she was drunk but 
believe me my daughter was so happy with her new life about to begin in 
Thailand with a new job etc. Why would anyone make up such stories, to 
make themselves out foolish or stupidans?'

Police Major General Ronnapong Saikew
said the woman was shouting at police a lot and had expressed her 
intention to leave Thailand on the next plane. A flight departing Nakorn
Sri Thammarat connected with onward flights to London at Bangkok's 
Suvarnabhumi International airport.

A Thai Daily newspaper which 
published details of the victim, including her photograph, has now 
removed them from the internet after protests.
