Barely 10 minutes had gone when Roy Hodgson left his seat and adopted an uneasy stance on the touchline, a few yards from Fabian Delph, who was already beginning to look like a red card in a white shirt.

Hodgson’s team selection had been bold and here it was in danger backfiring. It seemed a matter of when not if Delph would commit the foul which cut short his first start for his country.

Fortunately for all concerned, the quiet word, or the sight of James Milner being sent out to warm up, did the trick.

Competitive debut: Fabian Delph made his first competitive appearance for England 

Delph got hold of his emotions, cooled his mind and produced a confident display packed with the energy and desire which will give the England boss hope that with a little polish this crazy diamond can shine on.

It needs more work and it has defensive frailties. Jack Wilshere is not a natural Pirlo with his instinct to carry the ball, not pass it on, but even during the course of the game, it was possible to see Hodgson’s players coming to terms with a system designed to offer more freedom to Raheem Sterling.

In the first half Sterling was too often smothered and roughed-up in congested areas. Later in the game, he became influential. He was involved in both goals and was a real threat once England were ahead and the Swiss pushed forward. 

Booked: Delph was given a yellow card after just nine minutes 

Penalty appeal: Delph could have earned England a spot kick when he was challenged by Johan Djourou

If it is to work, Hodgson needs those on outside of his diamond to have the legs to cover ground and quality to keep the ball. Jordan Henderson has established himself in the last 12 months and last night Delph repaid Hodgson’s faith.

This was not the first time he has trusted youth and inexperience at vital moments in defiance of his reputation for caution. He threw 18-year-old Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain into the first game of Euro 2012 and the hardest fixture of the group, against France.

It was Ox’s first competitive international, just as it was for Sterling when Hodgson moved Wayne Rooney left in order to play the teenager in the No.10 role, against Italy in the World Cup opener in Manaus.

His gamble last year on Andros Townsend was a spectacular success. The Tottenham winger sparkled on debut and scored the third in a 4-1 win against Montenegro, England’s penultimate World Cup qualifier and one they had to win.

Last night in Basle, it was a game they could not afford to lose. Out went the flying wingers and in came Delph for his second cap, after a promising 21 minutes as a substitute against Norway last week.

He opened with an explosive burst down the flank left past adventurous right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner and a quick snap into a clean challenge to win the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield.

On the ball he was sure and confident. He passed it well and linked up with Leighton Baines. He was not overawed. Off it, he simmered with aggression and a thread of recklessness which rarely goes down well with officials in European football.

Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir needed less than nine minutes to show Delph his yellow card. It was for late sliding tackle which took over Lichtsteiner, and it might have been worse. Cakir would have been within his rights to book him moments when he cut through Valon Behrami from behind.

Fortunately, the referee played the advantage and the angry reaction from the crowd had been quelled by the time he came to tick off the Villa midfielder.

This fearless tenacity has always been part of the appeal. He was still a youth team player at Leeds when he wiped out manager Dennis Wise in a training game. Wise being Wise was impressed and quickly promoted him.

Line up: Delph (bottom right) was rewarded for some impressive performances for Aston Villa  

After this breakthrough at Elland Road and a £6million transfer to Aston Villa, he was soon tipped for the international stage but injuries and instability at his club interfered. Having finally made the step, his exuberance was perhaps understandable.

Delph continued to hurtle into challenges, ever keen to launch into a slide tackle. Hodgson must have toyed with the idea of an early change, but eventually Delph settled down and so did England.

It might have happened sooner had the team taken one of its early chances and soothed the nerves before the first of Daniel Welbeck’s goals.

By the end, he seemed entirely at home. There was no suggestion of him coming off as Hodgson made changes. He ran for miles and made contributions in both penalty boxes. There was a good block to deny Granit Xhaka and a good shout for a penalty, 10 minutes from time.

In a department where England are painfully thin, here was a big bonus for Hodgson.
