West Ham teenage star Oscar Borg is subject to a tug-of-war between the England and Turkey national teams. 

The 17-year-old was born and grew up in Surrey but alerted the Turkish Football Association to his eligibility when they discovered his grandmother was born in Istanbul.

Since then representatives from the English and Turkish FAs have contacted his parents to declare their interest in him.

Borg has been dubbed the next Gareth Bale for his ferocious pace down the left flank playing at full-back or on the wing.

West Ham United youngster Oscar Borg is wanted by both England and Turkey on an international level

He went on trial at Manchester United last summer, when he was 16, during which he played in the Milk Cup in Ireland for them where he impressed in matches against CSKA Moscow, County Armagh, Gold Coast Academy and Vendee. 

He also featured in an Under 18 Premier League fixture against Bolton at Manchester United's Carrington training ground. 

But a move collapsed when United were unable to agree a suitable compensation package, understood to be around £220,000, with West Ham.

Aston Villa have been monitoring him long-term while Chelsea and Fulham have also been keeping tabs on his situation, though the player is currently happy in East London.

Borg joined West Ham when he was spotted by their scouts playing an Under 13 match for AFC Wimbledon and joined them aged 12.

At 15 he already earned a called up to West Ham's Under 21 side and signed a two-year scholarship contract with them last September which runs until June 2016.

Borg is yet to represent a national team at youth level but his impressive form has sparked a battle between England and Turkey for his services.

One to watch: Borg has been likened to Gareth Bale because of his ferocious pace from left-midfield
