Quincy, Massachusetts firefighters leaped into action when a cab driver knocked on their door in the wee hours and said his passenger was having a baby.

The firefighters in Quincy, south of Boston, not only delivered the baby girl on the sidewalk at the corner of Hancock st and east Squantum at 1:36 a.m. on Friday, they saved her life.

Fire Lt. Shawn Darcy says when he and his colleagues firefighter John Banuk and firefighter Timothy Lynch reached the cab, the baby had been partially delivered.

Lt. Shawn Darcy and his colleagues delivered a baby on a sidewalk at 1:30 am on Friday

They completed the delivery but found that the baby wasn't breathing so they suctioned the baby's airway and tapped on her feed to stimulate her breathing.

An ambulance showed up and transported the baby and her parents to the hospital, where all are reportedly doing well.

'Everybody was breathing, crying and happy,' Darcy said to CBS.

The Mail Online spoke with Deputy Chief Fenby who said that all firefighters are trained to deliver babies though it doesn't happen often.

'Most mothers know when they're about to have a baby,' he joked.

Fenby said he heard that the family was on the way to the hospital when the woman began giving birth but he could not confirm that as fact.

Firefighters are EMTs and first responders and there are what are called 'OB kits' on board the truck at all times in cased they need to deliver a child.

The kit has tools like sterile blankets on which the mother of the child rested as she was giving birth.

The identity of the family has still not been made public but the mother and the child are reportedly doing well.
