Most people on a day trip to enjoy the picturesque beauty of the Isle of Wight would hop on a ferry.

But when Princess Beatrice paid a visit she avoided the queues and bustle of Portsmouth sea terminal – not to mention a £17.20 return fare – by hitching a ride with the Royal Navy.

The 25-year-old’s decision to hop aboard HMS Ranger, an Archer-class patrol boat, when she travelled to the island last week raised eyebrows, with one resident saying: ‘Why couldn’t she come on the ferry like everyone else?’

It is not known whether Prince Andrew, a former Navy Commander, pulled any strings to help his daughter hitch a lift, but insiders were quick to insist that the boat-ride did not place an additional burden on the taxpayer.

Senior naval sources added that there were long-standing plans for the vessel to train in Isle of Wight waters.

The 20-metre-long vessel, part of the 1st Patrol Boat Squadron, provides
 navigation training to junior officers and university cadets out of HM 
Naval Base Portsmouth.

HMS Ranger deposited the sixth in line to the throne at the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes.

It later collected her from the same place after she had finished her official engagement.

Most day-trippers travelling between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight 
would catch the ferry to Ryde or Fishbourne. Public transport does not 
stop at Cowes.

Beatrice’s schedule included stops at some of the island’s main historic
 attractions, as well as some landmarks of particular personal 
significance to the royal.

Her first port of call was to Carisbrooke Castle – the home of her 
former ancestor and namesake, Princess Beatrice, who served as governor 
of the Isle of Wight until her death in 1944.

The previous Princess Beatrice was the youngest of Queen Victoria’s 
nine children and her lifelong companion.

She was appointed Governor 
after the death of her husband Prince Henry in 1896, and lived at 
Osborne Cottage on the Osborne Estate until 1912, when she moved to the 
Governor’s House at Carisbrooke Castle.

Her trip was revealed in the week it emerged her uncle, Prince 
Charles, spent more than £1.2million on official travel last year – 
including £250,000 on hiring a private jet to attend Nelson Mandela’s 
funeral.

Angered by the news that the Royal Navy had allowed the princess to hitch a lift on June 16, one resident said: ‘When the Duke of Gloucester came over last year, he came down from London in his own car and then came across on the ferry from Portsmouth.

'Prince Andrew must have pulled some strings with his old Navy chums.’

However a Navy source said that it was not a case of ‘Oh, you’re going Cowes, we’ll do a mission especially to suit you’.

Despite the planned training in the area, sources declined to say whether the vessel was actually due to stop-off at Cowes, if Beatrice’s officials requested the stop or if the Royal Navy chief had offered one.

A source told the Mail that the costs of the royal sightseeing visit – which was at the request of the local Lieutenancy – were covered by the Duke of York.

‘Princess Beatrice has a full-time job in the business sector, from which she was on annual leave.’

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the boat was on a ‘regular exercise’.
