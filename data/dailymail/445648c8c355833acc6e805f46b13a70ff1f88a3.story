The Queen met staff and volunteers preparing for the Commonwealth Games today as excitement around the competition builds in Glasgow.

The monarch was accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh for a behind the scenes look at venues in the city.

The royal couple received a tour of Kelvin Hall, which is home to the uniform and accreditation centre for the Games, where they spoke with volunteers and staff.

The Queen, wearing a Karl Ludwig pale buttercup yellow crepe coat, floral silk dress and Angela Kelly hat, was shown around by Commonwealth Games staff, including head of accreditation Adrian Wood and operations manager Ed Saayeng.

He said: 'The visit was a brilliant experience. She was much more laid back than I expected and very open and interested in what we are doing here.'

Around 15,000 volunteers have already collected their accreditation for the Games, from a total of 50,000 expected to pass through the centre’s doors before the competition begins later this month.

The Queen, who last visited Kelvin Hall in 1951 to open an exhibition of industrial power, was presented with a special accreditation pass during the tour.
