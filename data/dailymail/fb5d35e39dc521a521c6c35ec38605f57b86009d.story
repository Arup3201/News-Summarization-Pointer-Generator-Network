A 10-year-old boy who had suffered a bad reaction to morphine died after being prescribed an opiate patch by an A&E doctor who overruled a hospital pharmacist, an inquest heard today.

Jane Warren, 39, wept as she told an inquest how she discovered the body of her son Tom on the sofa at the family’s three-bedroom bungalow in Greenwich, south-east London.

She told Southwark Coroner’s Court: ‘His lips were pale; I put my hand underneath his nose next to see if I could feel his breathing. I couldn’t, I called 999.’

Aged just 10: Tom Warren (pictured), who had suffered a bad reaction to morphine, died after being prescribed an opiate patch by an A&E doctor who overruled a hospital pharmacist, an inquest heard

Mrs Warren said that two days earlier she had taken her son - a Charlton Athletic football fan who died in November 2008 - to A&E at nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital because he was in acute pain.

There, she overheard Dr Lewis Ingram, who is no longer on the medical register following mental health issues, put pharmacist Manisha Daudia ‘in her place’ as he insisted she issue the prescription.

The inquest heard Tom, who has a twin-sister called Megan, was born premature, weighing just 2lbs 8oz. His parents later found he suffered from cerebral palsy and mild sclerosis.

Tom was in a wheelchair and had problems with his hips. He underwent a seven-hour operation in 2008 to try to relieve his hip pain - after which he was still in agony, so doctors gave him morphine.

Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris asked Mrs Warren: ‘You say his mood changed and he became uncontrollable, and the doctors said his behaviour could be because of him being given morphine?’

She replied: ‘That’s what I was told.’ Mrs Warren said that after his operation Tom suffered from intermittent pain, adding: ‘It wasn’t constant pain, but every now and then he would complain of it.’

The family had organised a meeting with Tom’s doctor, Dr Martin Gough, at QEH, but four days before the scheduled meeting his pain increased, leading him to be taken to A&E at the hospital.

Mrs Warren got a phone call from Tom’s school saying he was in a lot of pain - and she was advised by a physiotherapist to take him to A&E, the inquest heard.

She said the pain would come and go because one minute he would be chatting, then ‘the colour would drain from his face’.

Tom was examined by Dr Lewis Ingram when he arrived at the hospital, the inquest heard.

Mrs Warren said: ‘He said “has Tom had morphine recently?” I said “yes” he had, and asked if he couldn’t have morphine because of the reaction he had. He explained that there is an opiate in the same family, and it reacts in a different way and is in a patch.’

The doctor prescribed the opiate patch to Tom and the family went to the hospital pharmacy to collect the prescription, the inquest heard.

However, Mrs Warren said that Ms Daudia was not happy with the prescription when they went to collect it, and Dr Ingram arrived.

Mrs Warren added: ‘We couldn’t hear the whole conversation, but it was clear that the pharmacist wasn’t happy with Tom taking opiates.’

Dr Harris asked her: ‘You say the pharmacist was fighting her corner to try and get something different?’

Mrs Warren replied: ‘He put her in her place and you could overhear him talking about all his years of experience and he was in no doubt this was the right way to go. She then came over and said he had halved the dose.’

The inquest was told that Tom’s parents used the opiate patch and it was not removed until he reached the hospital the day he died.

Later in the hearing, hospital pharmacist Ms Daudia admitted she was ‘not happy’ about the strength of the dose a doctor had prescribed.

Tom suffered a bad reaction to an opiate patch he was given containing 25mg of fentanyl and diazepam.

Ms Daudia told the hearing she 
confronted Dr Ingram, who had initially prescribed 50mg, about the 
strength of the dose, but she had been overruled.

She said she was unsure about whether Tom
 had previously been prescribed morphine and thought 25mg might be far 
too strong for someone who was ‘opiate naïve’.

She said: ‘I had concerns 50mg was too
 high, especially as it was well over the product recommendations, and I
 suggested 12mg would be more appropriate.

‘I
 did try to explore further his mother’s statement that morphine does 
not suit Tom, but without success. Dr Ingram said that dose would not 
touch Tom’s pain as he believed Tom’s pain level was chronic.

Concerns: Mrs Warren said she overheard Dr Lewis Ingram put pharmacist Manisha Daudia (pictured) 'in her place' as he insisted she issue the prescription

‘I suggested ordinary painkillers, but he said they would not help. But he agreed to lower the dose to 25mg. The lowest available dose was 12mg.

‘I tried to explain my feelings about putting Tom on a lower dose first, but the difficulty I had was Dr Ingram interrupted me in the middle of my sentences. I made him aware of my concerns, but he did not really acknowledge them.

'I was still not happy with the dose, but I felt I had tried my best and the doctor was not going to listen to what I would say.

'I relied on Dr Ingram’s experience and clinical judgement. If he had stayed at 50mg I don’t think I would have given the prescription.’

Ms Daudia, who had been in the post for just two months, said she had spoken to senior pharmacists and two other doctors for advice, none of whom had said the initial dose was dangerous.

She said: ‘I don’t feel anyone stepped into help me deal with the actual prescription.

‘The level of the drug was outside the product licence, but the majority of drugs prescribed to children were “off label” because of the limitations of testing and the difficulty of carrying out clinical trials on children.

‘One senior pharmacist said she had never encountered a dose like that in children before. But nobody told me it was dangerous.’

Despite her doubts, Ms Daudia gave the patch to Tom, who collapsed on the sofa while wearing it at the family home, the inquest heard.

She said she was aware the patch could cause ‘depression of the central nervous system and respiration’ but did not tell Tom’s mother of the possible side effects.

Ms Daudia said: ‘I told her about the effects of drowsiness and sedation. I should have mentioned depression of the central nervous system, but didn’t. But I would not have expected this to
 happen - it was a rare side effect.

'You don’t tell patients of all the 
side effects, otherwise they might not take a drug that could help them 
because they are too scared.’

In
 giving her evidence, Ms Daudia said, looking back, she
 would not have given Tom the drug.  She added: ‘With hindsight I should 
have refused to dispense the prescription.

‘But,
 however, I do not feel I had the experience or training to disagree 
with Dr Ingram even further. I was adequately satisfied with Dr Ingram’s
 explanation. I did all I could to help Tom’s pain.’

Paying tribute to Tom, his mother said: 
‘He was a fun-loving little man, who could charm the birds out of the 
trees. He loved his football, he loved his music, he loved life, and he 
was humorous and funny.’

After Mrs Warren finished giving evidence to the inquest, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust apologised to the family for the death of their son.

Malcolm Fortune, representing the Trust, said: ‘On behalf of the Trust, I would like to apologise publicly for the tragic loss of your son, Tom.’

Dr Ingram was unable to give evidence in person because he had a serious mental illness, the inquest heard.

'His lips were pale; I put my hand underneath his nose next to see if I could feel his breathing. I couldn't, I called 999'

Jane Warren

Sarah Elliot QC, representing the Warren family, said: ‘The family should be able to understand why a key witness, who prescribed a drug which some of the witnesses are going to say may have contributed to his death, is not going to give live evidence before this court.’

Coroner Dr Harris said: ‘The family have been aware that serious mental issues dictate that Dr Ingram is not fit to give evidence.’

Mary O’Rouke QC, representing Dr Ingram, added: ‘The GMC have removed Dr Ingram from the medical register.’

The Coroner ruled that questions should be sent to Dr Ingram through the court and judged by his legal team and a psychiatrist if he can answer them. The inquest continues.
