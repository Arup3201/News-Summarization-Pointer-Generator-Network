Woken by an explosion that shook her home, Margaret Goodwin knew she was in a pickle the moment she saw the wreckage in her kitchen.

The fridge door had been blown off and the shock wave had lifted the ceiling, cracked walls, sent shards of glass flying and blasted the casing off an extractor fan.

Fearing that perhaps a gas main had exploded, she called the fire brigade, who revealed that her flat had actually been blown up by...rhubarb chutney.

Mrs Goodwin, 66, had been given the home-made preserve by a neighbour and had left it in the fridge in an uncovered ceramic ramekin.

After five days, the chutney, which was made without the chemical preservatives used in mass-produced varieties, began to ferment and give off methane – a gas that can be explosive when mixed with air.

And so it proved for Mrs Goodwin, whose fridge had been shut for 12 hours, meaning there was nowhere for the gas to go until she heard a ‘massive bang’ while in bed at 7am. ‘It was a terrible shock,’ the divorcee said. ‘My bed jolted and there was a tremendous noise.

‘I knew it was from my flat and approached the kitchen with trepidation. It was a total mess inside.

Wreckage: Margaret Goodwin was confronted with a scene of destruction after investigating a huge explosion in her kitchen early on Tuesday morning

‘I always keep the kitchen door shut 
but it had blown that open. The sides of the fridge had ballooned out 
and it was split at the back.

‘I was quite shaken up. I’m just glad I wasn’t in the kitchen at the time – it could’ve killed me.

‘I didn’t know what had happened and was worried there might be more explosions, so I rang 999.’

Baffled
 firemen were left scratching their heads after the explosion on 
Tuesday, having failed to find any fault with the fridge, until someone 
asked Mrs Goodwin what she had left in it – and the penny dropped.

Adrian
 Green, technical manager of the Hanover retirement complex where Mrs 
Goodwin lives, said: ‘Methane from the chutney was the only logical 
cause.

'I spoke to the fire service and they agreed. It’s a real one-off.

'I’ve never come across anything like this before.  We’ve asked around to see if anyone else may have been given some of this chutney – obviously it doesn’t pay to have it knocking around too long.’

Dr John Emsley, a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, said: ‘Methane and air are highly explosive, but normally you’d have to have an electrical spark. Perhaps the light in the fridge was faulty. It’s a very rare occurrence.’

Mrs Goodwin, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said: ‘You wouldn’t think a little jar of rhubarb chutney could do such a thing.

'I thought the pressure building up in the fridge would force the door open to let the gases out, but the fire brigade tell me that when gases build up in a fridge, it actually makes the door seal itself even tighter.’

Mrs Goodwin, who will now have to redecorate, added: ‘The chutney tasted absolutely delicious, by the way.’

Fermentation: The explosion, which tore doors off their hinges, was caused by a build up of gasses in a jar of homemade rhubarb chutney which had been left in the fridge

PREPARATION TIME: Ten minutes.

COOKING TIME: One hour.

MAKES: Six jars.

INGREDIENTS: 2lb (900g) rhubarb, 2lb (900g) sugar, 1lb (450g) sultanas, one pint of vinegar, 1oz (25g) salt, 1oz (25g) powdered ginger, one finely chopped onion, half a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of ordinary pepper.

PREPARATION: Put all the ingredients in a pan and bring them to the boil before reducing the heat. Let it simmer away until thick and dark brown, while stirring the mixture now and then.Pour the chutney into clean, sterilised jars and store with  lids on.
