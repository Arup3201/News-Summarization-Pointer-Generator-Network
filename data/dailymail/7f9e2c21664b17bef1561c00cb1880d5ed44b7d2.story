Two women who say they were sexually abused as teenagers by financial guru and former Clinton confidante Jeffrey Epstein in his Palm Beach mansion are hoping a trove of newly released documents will get the case reopened.

Epstein was suspected nearly a decade ago of paying for sex with dozens of underage girls.

The FBI ultimately dropped its investigation, and Epstein pleaded guilty to a single offense and served more than a year in jail.

Recently, though, Epstein's accusers won a precedent-setting ruling that will let them see the documents regarding the deal Epstein made with the government.

The women say they were left in the dark about the agreement, only learning about it after Epstein pleaded guilty to the single solicitation charge.

The women are hoping to undo the agreement and subject Epstein to more charges.

The women's lawyers say Epstein got a sweetheart deal because of his wealth and connections.

Among those connections were his ties to then-President Bill Clinton who flew on Epstein's private jet more than 10 times.

Flight logs from 2002 to 2005 that were only disclosed in March show that Clinton, who was only recently out of the White House at that point, travelled around the world courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein while his wife, Hillary, was a senator in New York.

Among the stops were Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James, where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves.

Clinton was deemed to be so close to Epstein he was nearly forced to give a statement during the investigation into the latter’s paedophilic tendencies, legal documents revealed in March.

Epstein, who is now 61, is considered to be one of the most well-connected men in America caused acute embarrassment to Prince Andrew, who was at one point photographed with Virginia Roberts, one of  the girls Epstein is said to have used as a sex slave.

The Duke of York also stayed at Epstein’s home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet.

The investigation into Epstein's exploits came when a woman in Palm Beach contacted police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex.

The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender.

Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.
