Michael Howard, 73, has been named as a candidate to be Britain's next EU Commissioner

Michael Howard was named yesterday as a candidate to be Britain’s next EU Commissioner.

The former Tory leader, 73, is understood not to have been ruled out as David Cameron prepares to name his choice for the job following months of speculation.

Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are also tipped to conduct a mini ministerial reshuffle, possibly on Monday.

But the Brussels appointment has dominated Mr Cameron’s thinking and yesterday’s Spectator magazine listed Lord Howard, a former Home Secretary, as one of those in the frame.

A Government source confirmed he was being considered, but insisted: ‘It remains highly unlikely. His name has clearly been around. The final decision hasn’t been taken.’

Several others touted for the role – including Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – are said to be out of the running.  

However in the Cabinet, Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson are among those still tipped in an announcement likely to come next week.

Business and energy minister Michael Fallon, highly regarded by No 10 as being reliable in a crisis, is also the subject of intense speculation.  

Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell has not been ruled out – though ongoing legal cases surrounding the so-called ‘Plebgate’ affair, which saw him accused of swearing in the presence of police officers at Downing Street, may make his appointment difficult.

EU diplomats insist that whoever is selected, Britain may come away empty-handed when EU leaders carve up a package of top EU jobs next week, due to its fierce opposition to Jean-Claude Juncker’s appointment as European Commission president.

Mr Cameron infuriated other leaders last month by breaking with a tradition of taking decisions by consensus and forcing them to vote on whether Mr Juncker should head the EU executive. Only Britain and Hungary voted no.

Yesterday it also emerged that Nick Clegg is considering a plan to catapult his youngest female MP into the Cabinet, in a bid to tackle the Liberal Democrats’ image as a party of the ‘pale, male and stale’.

Lib Dem sources claim that Jo Swinson, 34, could be fast-tracked into the Cabinet as early as this month to replace Energy Secretary Ed Davey.

An alternative plan is also being considered that would see her appointed as Scottish Secretary following the independence referendum in  September, as part of a wider pre-election reshuffle.

Mr Clegg is desperate to be seen doing more to make his top team look more inclusive, following a string of sex scandals – including claims that former party chief executive Lord Rennard made inappropriate advances towards female activists.

But his 57-strong group of MPs contains just seven women and no-one from an ethnic minority, limiting his options. One Lib Dem said the lack of diversity was ‘embarrassing’, adding: ‘We used to call the Tories pale, male and stale, but look at us.’

Miss Swinson, minister for consumer affairs, only recently returned from maternity leave after having her first child before Christmas.

But Mr Clegg believes she is ready for a front-line role in the run-up to the election.

Meanwhile, there were signs last night that Tory Right-wingers are circling the wagons to protect their own in Mr Cameron’s reshuffle.

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson urged Mr Cameron not to bow to pressure from green groups to sack the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, a leading Eurosceptic.
