New laws could give Russian courts the right to seize foreign-owned assets, in a move seen as a backlash against Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

A draft submitted to parliament on Wednesday by a pro-Kremlin deputy would also allow state compensation for individuals whose property is seized by overseas courts.

Italian authorities this week seized property worth about £23million($40 million) belonging to companies controlled by Arkady Rotenberg, an ally of President Vladimir Putin.

The Kremlin and St Basil's Cathedral, Moscow: A draft law submitted to parliament on Wednesday by a pro-Kremlin deputy would allow Russian courts to seize foreign-owned assets in the country

The draft law, published on a parliamentary database, would allow for compensation for Russian citizens who suffer because of an 'unlawful court act' in a foreign jurisdiction.

It would also clear the way to foreign state assets in Russia being seized, even if they are subject to international immunity.

Boris Nemtsov, a Kremlin critic who in the late 1990s was a senior member of government, said the bill was an attempt by Putin to shield Russian billionaires and officials from the impact of sanctions.

'What is a strongman's friendship like?' he asked rhetorically on his Facebook page.

'It is when your four villas, apartment and hotel are seized in Italy, and your accomplice in the Kremlin immediately introduces a bill to compensate for the losses from the Russian budget.'

Russia and the West are locked in their worst standoff in decades over the Ukraine crisis.

Western powers have introduced several sets of sanctions against Moscow, ranging from visa bans and asset freezes to caps on access to overseas capital markets for Russian firms.

Russia responded by introducing food bans against EU agriculture producers and has threatened more retaliatory measures if the West presses ahead with sanctions.

Russia's economy is set to stagnate in the next two years as the country pays the price for the Ukraine crisis, lack of structural reforms and uncertain economic policy, the World Bank said in a report this week.

Russian laws require three readings in the lower house and the approval of the upper house before going to Putin to be signed into law.
