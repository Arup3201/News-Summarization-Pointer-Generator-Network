Starting with the DynaTAC in 1974 and ending with Apple’s iPhone 5S, a team of designers has plotted the major milestones in the 40-year history of the mobile phone.

The first cellular voice calls were made in 1973 and it took ten years for the first handheld phone, called the DynaTAC 8000x, to go on sale.

Since then the number of phones has risen to more than 6 billion and this video shows how market leaders of the 1980s and 90s, such as Nokia and Motorola, have made way for the likes of Apple and Samsung.

Starting with the DynaTAC in 1974, to the Nokia 7110 of the mid-1990s, and ending with Apple's iPhone 5S, a team of designers from New York has plotted the major milestones in the 40-year history of the mobile phone. The Nokia 7110 was the first mobile phone to run Series 40 and to come with a WAP browser

The iPhone was released on 29 June 2007 in the U.S before being made available in the UK and Europe in November.

It is attributed as revolutionising the smartphone industry and fuelled the rise in handsets around the world.

The original iPhone operating system 3.1.3 was the last version of iPhone OS (now iOS) to be released for the original model.

It comes in 4GB, 8GB and 16GB versions and prices started at $499 (£309). 

The original iPhone has a 3.5-inch, 160-pixel per inch screen.

The phone includes, contacts, calendar, visual voice mail, SMS and quad-band GSM + Edge, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Jobs announced at the launch the software also lets people have multiple SMS messaging sessions at once.

The video was created by London-based design and development firm Fueled.

Its soundtrack features a Motorola advert from the 1980s which predicted the rise of the mobile.

The voiceover says: 'Industry watchers say there are only a few thousand of cellular phones in use right now, but that number is expected to grow considerably within the next few years – during the cellular revolution.’

Fueled’s video begins with the DynaTAC ‘brick’ phone developed by Dr Martin Cooper. 

Cooper made the first phone call over a cellular network in 1973, but it took a decade until his DynaTAC 8000x was sold as the first commercial handheld phone in 1983.

It weighed 1.75lb, stood 13-inch high, stored 30 numbers, took 10 hours to recharge and cost $3,995 (£2,390).

The 'brick' was followed by the pioneering Motorola MicroTAC 9800X which had one of the world's first 'flip' designs.

The world's first digital phone, the TPU 900 pictured right, was launched in 1991 by Orbitel

The Hagenuk MT-200, pictured left, went on sale in the 1990s and was the first mobile to run games, in particular a version of Tetris created by Hagenuk's team of developers, pictured right

The world's first GSM, or digital, phone was launched in 1991 by a British firm called Orbitel. The Orbitel TPU 900 weighed more than 4lbs, and its sister model, the TPU 901, was the first phone to receive a text message in 1992.

During the mid-1990s Nokia released its 7110 model, while German phone manufacturer Hagenuk released its MT-200.

The Nokia 7110 was the first mobile phone to run Series 40 and to come with a WAP browser. It went on sale in October 1999.

Canadian firm BlackBerry released its first phone, the 6210, pictured, in 2003. It was the 10th BlackBerry handset, but was the first with an integrated phone. The 5810 had phone functions, but users needed an additional headset to use them

The 5810 had phone functions, but users needed an additional headset to use them. The 850, introduced in 1999, was just a two-way pager.

By comparison, the 6210 offered e-mail, phone, text messaging, a browser and BlackBerry Messenger. 

In Fueled's video, the original iPhone was quickly followed by a succession of handsets including the HTC Dream, the iPhone 3G and 3GS, Google and Galaxy Nexus and finally the iPhone 5S, pictured, and Galaxy Note 2 both released towards the end of last year

Fueled said: 'It's remarkable how little the iPhone's aesthetic has changed in contrast to Android models', such as the Galaxy Note 2 pictured

Fueled said: 'It's remarkable how little the iPhone's aesthetic has changed in contrast to Android models, which are becoming larger and changing constantly.

'What will the next 40 years look like? While I don't know exactly when, it's only a matter of time before the cellphone will be completely obsolete.'
