These may be tough economic times, but that hasn't stopped one mobile phone case designer saying 'What the hey!', and throwing rare pink and white diamonds, 18-carat rose gold and Italian leather at the problem.

Uunique London has released the most expensive iPhone case in the world, made out of exactly those luxury materials.

And will be sending an eye-watering invoice of £189,000 to anyone who wants to take one home (if they haven't had to sell their home to afford one, that is).

Don't drop it down the loo! The Uunique London Lotus iPhone 5 case, left, costs £189,000 and was launched in London by Mischa Barton, right, last night

The case was launched at a party hosted 
by Mischa Barton - who designed some of the cases in the range - in London last night, where it was showcased alongside 
other (marginally) cheaper models in the brand's new collection.

The Uunique cases - which come in white leather, brown leather, snake skin, animal prints, Swarovski crystals and, of course, diamonds - start at £34.99 but quickly rocket up to £600 before reaching the jaw-dropping price of the latest fl;ashy design.
