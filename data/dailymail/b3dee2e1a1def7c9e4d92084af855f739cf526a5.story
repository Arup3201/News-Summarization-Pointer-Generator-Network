She has managed the nigh on impossible - and snared Hollywood A-lister George Clooney.

But as high-flying British barrister Amal Alamuddin enjoys dates with the dashing star at the White House and romantic trips to the Seychelles, it's quite a distance from her childhood in Buckinghamshire in the UK.

The striking lawyer, who has been representing Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, was just two when she moved from her birthplace of Beirut, Lebanon, to the UK.

Amal, 37, who is now a British citizen, was brought up by her mother Baria - who bears more than a striking resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor - and father Ramzi.

And Baria makes no secret of her pride 
at her daughter's budding new relationship. Indeed, on her Facebook page
 she 'recommends' an article about Clooney missing the Oscars earlier this month to take his new
 love on vacation, as first revealed by MailOnline.

Baria, 66, is the foreign editor of Al Hayat, a widely-read Arab newspaper, and has made numerous appearances as an analyst on Middle Eastern affairs on CNN and Al-Jazeera as well as CNBC, the BBC and Sky News in the UK.

Her beauty was said to be so striking that she has been said to resemble Elizabeth Taylor - while the poet Said Aki praised her 'Greek' beauty in poem.

She has interviewed numerous heads of state including King Hamad Bin Issa Alkhalifa, President Hosni Moubarak, King Hussain of Jordan, Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Fidel Castro - and was the last journalist to talk to Indira Gandhi before she died.

She once said: 'I speak on behalf of moderate Muslims who are being cast aside in this war against terrorism.'

Baria is a frequent guest speaker and moderator at international conferences, she has been the President of the IAC (International Arab Charity) since 2004 and is a member of the advisory board of the Tallberg Forum in Sweden.

And it would seem that Amal comes from good stock as her grandmother was the first woman graduate of the American University in Beirut.

It is believed that Baria and Ramzi fled Lebanon at the time of the civil war, however, Ramzi moved back in 1991.

Ramzi was formerly a university professor and is the ex-vice president of the American University of Beirut.

Today, Baria lives in Buckinghamshire in a house valued at $1.4million.

Amal was educated in English law at St.Hugh's College at Oxford University and joined NYU School of Law in 2000.

Amal now specialises in international law and human 
rights. She's now based at London's Doughty Street Chambers.n 2011 she started representing WikiLeaks founder Assange in his fight 
against extradition to Sweden.

The beauty is fluent in French and Arabic and is also advising Kofi Annan, the former United Nations Secretary General, on Syria.

She is also the author of several book chapters and articles on international criminal law. 

Rumours
 about Amal and Oscar winner Clooney, 52, first surfaced when they were spotted together in London 
last October. At the time Clooney described her
 as a ‘friend’. 

But her 
status appears to have changed since the start of this year.

In February, MailOnline revealed how Amal accompanied Clooney to a White House screening of 
his latest film, Monuments Men, where onlookers described them as being 
‘very much together.’

And earlier this month, the couple enjoyed a vacation together in Tanzania, where they were spotted enjoying a safari, followed by a trip to the Seychelles,

Last year, Amal topped the 21 Hottest Baristers in London list for women, created by Yourbarristerboyfriend.tumblr.com.

Her entry on the site begins: ‘Amo, Amas, Amal. These are three short words that come to mind when thinking about this dazzling beauty.’

Clooney has dated a string of stunning women over the years from British model Lisa Snowdon to Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and former pro-wrestler Stacy Keibler, who is recently married and pregnant.

But when asked in a recent interview who is or was the greatest love of his life, the Gravity star replied: ‘I haven’t met her yet.’
