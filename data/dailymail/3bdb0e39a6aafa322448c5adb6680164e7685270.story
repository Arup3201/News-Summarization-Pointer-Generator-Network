Nothing can keep Karla Sanchez San Martin, one of Mexico's few female bullfighters, from facing off against her bovine opponents. 

On Tuesday, the ambitious matador-in-training vowed to return to the ring by mid-January, two days after she and several others were gored by what she said was a 'very smart' bull.

The 26-year-old bullfighter, who fights under the stage name of 'Karla de los Angeles,' suffered a pair of gashes to the thigh and buttock when she was gored twice by the 1,090-pound beast Gamusino.

'From almost the beginning, he was hunting me,' De los Angeles said from the hospital room where she was recovering from a 9 ½ inch wound to the thigh and 6-inch slash to the backside.

De los Angeles was going in for the kill when the bull lifted his head, caught her with a horn and tossed her into the air. 

Bloodied and bandaged up, De los Angeles re-entered the ring at the Plaza de Toros de Mexico to finish off her formidable opponent.

'But the bull had already learned,' she said, noting he held his head high, making it hard for her to drive the sword in.

He caught her a second time with a lifted horn and tossed her to the dirt, goring her again.

Another bull in Sunday's fight leapt over the ring wall, crushing a spectator's face. Another man, identified as a bull breeder, also suffered injuries to his hand.

None of the injuries were considered life-threatening.

'It was one of those afternoons where the accidents happened one after the other, that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of those in the ring and the stands,' the Plaza Mexico bull ring wrote in an article on its web site.

De los Angeles said of the wounds, 'the truth is, right now it hurts a little bit' but 'this is not going to discourage me.' 

She said she has a fight on January 18, 'and I'm going to be there.' 

Federico Dominguez, de los Angeles' assistant, was also gored by the massive bull, BBC reported.

Gamusino injured two different assistants as well as a farmer after he leaped over the ring and went into a walkway, according to AFP. One of the assistants reportedly had a concussion and is in serious condition.

Some 5,000 people went to the bullring on Sunday, as part of a ten-day event, the wire service reported.  

After being attended to by medics Ms de los Angeles continued the fight only to be gored a second time

Speaking to Picture Radio in Spanish, de los Angeles said, 'I'm sad because I could not cut off an ear and I could not kill a second bull. 

'It was [a very bloody run], there were many mishaps, thank God, so far as it goes, we're fine,' she told Picture Radio. 'You have to accept it as it is, to recover and what comes.' 

De los Angeles' Facebook shows that in addition to being a female bullfighter, she is also the mother of a three-year-old daughter.

AFP reported that it was the first time three female Mexican bullfighters participated in an event at the Plaza de Toros de Mexico.

During General Francisco Franco's reign, women in Spain were not allowed to be matadors, BBC reported. That has since changed, though not many  bullfight professionally.
