Peter Wharton, pictured, said the 1p bill was a 'ludicrous' waste of public money

A businessman is furious after receiving a council tax bill for just 1p on the home of his late father.

Peter Wharton, 60, was sent a demand for the meagre amount despite the fact his 86-year-old father Jim died in the summer.

Darlington Borough Council's revenue and benefits team has since apologised for the upset the bill caused but said it is legally obliged to send it.

However, it said Mr Wharton is not expected to pay the outstanding bill.

Mr Wharton, who is still receiving his father's mail from his home in Darlington, County Durham, said council officials should use common sense.

The demand, which includes deductions for single occupancy and benefit payments, states if a bill is less than £5, then the recipient does not need to pay the balance.

However, Mr Wharton, managing director of a construction firm, said: 'If I am being told that I can disregard the letter, then why have they sent it out and what am I supposed to do with it?

'It just seems like a ludicrous waste of taxpayers’ money, especially at a time when the council is looking to save cash.

'Here is the perfect example of something they could have written off, but they didn’t, they put a stamp on it and posted it.

'If you asked the man on the street, I’m sure they would say that it makes no sense whatsoever.

'I know the council are probably following rules and procedures that have been laid down, but perhaps they should look at reviewing those regulations.'

The council spokeswoman added: 'We have a legal obligation to send out the letter, but we are not expecting Mr Wharton to pay the amount.

'The letters also help us keep track of a number of things, including changes within council tax bands.'
