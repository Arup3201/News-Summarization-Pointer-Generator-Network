They’ve marched down Broadway, stormed the Brooklyn Bridge and got permission to stay at their protest camp in New York against all odds. But they haven’t yet targeted a baseball game.

Fears are growing that Occupy Wall Street demonstrations could affect the World Series, which starts in St Louis, Missouri, on Wednesday, as protesters make the most of the media spotlight.

Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are both expected to attend - and police are worried about potential plans for a huge rally, pitching tents around the stadium or putting a streaker at Busch Stadium.

Painting the sign: The World Series opener between the Texas Rangers and St Louis Cardinals on Wednesday night will honour military veterans

The World Series opener between the Texas Rangers and St Louis Cardinals on Wednesday will honour military veterans and feature the First Lady and Dr Biden - wife of Vice President Joe Biden.

There will be a huge media spotlight on the event and police are concerned Occupy St Louis protesters may cause trouble, although only ten have been arrested since the demonstration began.

‘There are times that we know that there are certain elements that can get drawn into large protests and other people who have other agendas,’ a St. Louis police spokesman told CBS St Louis.

Police are concerned about a ‘lone wolf’ 
causing problems, but the protest has been relatively small so far in 
St. Louis and only 30 people have been camping overnight in a park near 
the stadium.

Mrs Obama and Dr Biden will take part in a pre-game ceremony at Busch Stadium as part of Major League Baseball’s ‘Welcome Back Veterans’ programme and Mrs Obama's ‘Joining Forces’ initiative.

 are certain elements that can get drawn into large protests and other 
people who have other agendas'

St. Louis police spokesman

Commissioner Bud Selig said the MLB is ‘honoured’ to have Mrs Obama and Dr Biden in attendance to recognise the ‘courageous men and women who serve the country as well as their families’.

Fans will be able to get into the ballpark up to three hours before the game begins and have been told to expect additional security checks on the gate of the stadium, which can hold 50,345 people.

Occupy St Louis is part of the international movement that has spawned from Occupy Wall Street in New York, in which demonstrators are angry at the state of the U.S. political and economic systems.
