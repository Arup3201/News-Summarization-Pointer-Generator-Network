A painting by Stephen Pearce of Dr John Rae, who is to be honoured with a plaque at Westminster Abbey

One of Britain's greatest Arctic explorers, whose reputation was trashed when he reported cannibalism within a lost British crew, will be honoured with a plaque at Westminster Abbey.

Dr John Rae was sent to the Arctic to find out what had happened to Sir John Franklin and his crew - who went missing in 1846 - and made a discovery so shocking it was refused by the establishment.

Inuit tribesmen told Dr Rae that Franklin's men has starved to death and resorted to eating each other after their ships got trapped in the ice.

After three journeys across the Arctic, Dr Rae reported back, saying that the men had 'been driven to the last dread alternative as a means of supporting life'. 

His unfavourable findings were widely criticised and led to him being completely discredited - Charles Dickens wrote a two-part essay theorising that it had actually been the Inuits who killed Franklin's men - and his version became the accepted story.

In his essays, Dickens wrote about the 'firmness, fortitude and courage' of the crew, compared with the Inuits - a 'gross handful of uncivilised people, with a domesticity of blood and blubber', The Times reports.

The successful campaign to sully Dr Rae's account was started by Franklin's widow, and he never recovered from it - he was the only Victorian explorer who was not knighted.

The mantle of having discovered the Northwest Passage was also given to Franklin - despite many believing that Dr Rae actually found it.

While shunned in his time, Dr Rae is now recognised as one of the country's great explorers, and a plaque with his name is to be unveiled in the Chapel of St John the Evangelist next week.

It has been placed below a bust of Franklin - to show reconciliation - and the unveiling ceremony will be attended by relatives of both explorers.

Also in attendance will be author Ken McGoogan - who helped restore Franklin's reputation with his book, 'Fatal Passage'. 

The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, told The Times: 'We are very keen on reconciliation here,' adding that Westminster Abbey would not be joining the debate about who discovered the Northwest Passage - a sea route which goes through the Arctic Ocean.

Modern historians largely believe it was Dr Rae who made the discovery, and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen - the first explorer to sail the passage - also gives him the credit.

His reports of cannibalism were all but confirmed back in 1997, when bones from some of the explorers who died were found on King William Island with cuts on them - implying that flesh had been sliced off them. 

Jane Hamilton, Dr Rae's great great grand-niece, will attend next week's ceremony, and said: 'John Rae survived because he got to know the Inuit ways and he looked after his own men. He only lost one person in the whole of his Arctic journeys.' 

Every member of Franklin's crew died in the Arctic after spending years in icy conditions. One of his ships was recently found in Victoria Strait in northern Canada.

John Rae is one of Britain's great Arctic explorers, but was largely discredited in his time because of the reports he brought back about Sir John Franklin's crew - which he had been sent out in search of - resorting to cannibalism after becoming trapped in the ice.

He was a Scottish doctor who took three trips to the Arctic Coast - between 1948 and 1951 - and is credited by many modern-day historians with discovering the Northwest Passage - a sea route through the Arctic Ocean along the coast of North America.

The first of these three trips took him from the Mackenzie River to the Coppermine River, on the second he was thwarted by ice as he tried to cross to Victoria Island and on the final expedition he managed to explore the whole south coast of Victoria island - in Canada.

As well as exploring the Arctic, Dr Rae also travelled to the Gulf of Boothia, north west of the Hudson Bay, and other parts of northern Canada.

He met the Inuits who told him of Franklin's fate near Pelly Bay after leaving Repulse Bay on March 31, 1854. One of the Inuits had a gold cap-band, and told him that he had got it from the body of one white man among around 35 who had starved to death.

He continued his explorations before meeting more Inuits in May. They communicated to him that they had met Franklin's crew four years before, and that, when they saw them again the following spring, around 30 men were dead and there were signs of cannibalism.

Despite not getting knighted, he did leave behind a legacy after his death in 1893 - at the age of 79. Rae Strait, Rae River and Mouth Rae - all in Canada or the Arctic - are among the landmarks named after him.
