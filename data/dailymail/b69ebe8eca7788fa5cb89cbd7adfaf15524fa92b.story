An illegal taxi driver tried to escape from police by hiding under his car - and then refusing to come out.

Jiang Tseng, 42, was stopped by police after they received a tip-off that he had been carrying passengers without a permit.

But instead of giving himself up, the driver hid under his cab and then refused to come out.

When Tseng refused to come out from under the vehicle more police were called to the scene

The scene, in Chengdu, Sichuan, southwest China, caused a major traffic jam in the city.

Police found that the rogue driver had three people and a child on board when it was stopped at traffic lights.

He was then asked to show his driving licence and the paperwork for the vehicle.

Tseng handed it over with the keys but then while officers were looking at the documents the man suddenly vanished.

Police spokesman Shaiming Jen said: 'They didn't need long to find him.

'As they hadn't seen him run off they knew he was somewhere near – and actually he had ducked under the bus.

'Although it was clear he wouldn't be able to get away, he still refused to come out and every time they tried to grab him he would wriggle away.'

The stand-off lasted for an hour and caused heavy traffic on a busy main road.

More officers were called to the scene and the driver was dragged out from beneath the car.  

Eyewitnesses alleged that the driver was demanding to be left alone, shouting that he did not want to live anymore.

Police said he would face a fine of £3,000 for the illegal taxi driving.

The illegal driver was fined £3,000 after he did not have the appropriate paperwork to be driving passengers around in his vehicle
