A fitness fanatic mother who gave birth a year ago has won an international bodybuilding contest - and now has her eyes set on TV stardom.

Natasha Gilson, 29, who works at NLG Fitness in Didsbury, won the Fit Factor event at BodyPower Expo in Birmingham in front of 60,000 people a week ago.

Natasha gave birth to daughter Anais in April last year, months after quitting her job at a law firm as it was ‘too formal’.

in front of 60,000 fitness enthusiasts. And, right, in December 2013

After a traumatic pregnancy, she decided to learn how to be a personal trainer during her maternity leave.

Now her work involves stripping down to a
 bikini and heels and showing off her chiselled muscles - and that’s all
 on top of her day job keeping people in shape.

The
 bodybuilding champ, who has a 25-inch waist and can lift 90kg, said: 
'There were 50 girls at the Expo but I was the one with the youngest 
baby.

Mother of all champions: 'I'd love to turn myself into a brand,' says bodybuilder Natasha, pictured here with daughter Anais

'Quite a lot of the woman had had cosmetics done, and some were wearing fake nails.

'I was the only woman there with an afro! The first round was really nerve-wracking, I was shaking like a leaf.

'But it turned into such a huge buzz. I didn’t want to leave the stage by the end. It was amazing.'

Now
 Natasha, whose weekend at the competition between 16-18 May was the 
longest she’s spent away from her now one-year-old daughter, wants to 
show off her talents on television, and says she could be Miss 
Motivator.

She
 explained: 'I want to strike while the iron’s hot. I’d love to turn 
myself into a brand. Maybe get on This Morning or get a regular fitness 
slot somewhere or write a fitness column.
