Scientists at Harvard have confirmed a 19th century book in one of the university's libraries is bound in human skin.

Conservators at the university carried out a series of tests on the binding, which left them '99.9% confident' the binding came from a human.

The book, Arsène Houssaye's Des destinées de l'ame, which translates as The Destiny Of The Soul, is described as a meditation on the soul and life after death and is believed to have been bound in skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient.

Houssaye is believed to have presented the book, a meditation on the soul and life after death, to his friend Dr Ludovic Bouland

Scientists confirmed the 
binding on the book, housed in the Houghton Library, is human skin after using a technique known as peptide 
mass fingerprintings to analyse microscopic samples.

The
 results create a 'peptide mass fingerprint' (PMF) which allows 
scientists to then rule out 'fingerprints' from other sources.

Bill
 Lane, director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource
 Laboratory, said: 'The PMF from Des destinées de l'ame matched the 
human reference, and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources, 
such as sheep, cattle and goat.

'However,
 although the PMF was consistent with human, other closely related 
primates, such as the great apes and gibbons, could not be eliminated 
because of the lack of necessary references.'

Further
 tests were carried out on the samples however which led the scientists to 
conclude it was 'very unlikely that the source could be other than 
human.'

In a blogpost on the library's website, Heather Cole, Assistant Curator of Modern Books & Manuscripts, claims Bouland bound the book with skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient who died of a stroke.

A note inside the book, written by Bouland, reads: 'A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering: I had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman'

In the note, Bouland also refers to another book bound in human skin, Séverin Pineau's De integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis, which is in the Wellcome Library collection
