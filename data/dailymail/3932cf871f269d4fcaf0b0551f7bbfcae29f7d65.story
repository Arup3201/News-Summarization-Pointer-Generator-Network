A neighbor of the 23-year-old Quincy man who is facing federal charges for his alleged connection with the Boston Marathon bombings said she heard loud explosions in the vicinity of the young man's house one week before the attack last year.

Khairullozhon Matanov was arrested Friday and charged with one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation. He had ties to the alleged bombing suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The Massachusetts cab driver allegedly went out for dinner with the pair hours after the attack on April 15, 2013.

Quincy resident Elizabeth Feitelberg said she heard two explosions in her neighborhood in March and April of last year, one so powerful it shook her house.

Arrest: Khairullozhon Matanov is facing charges of obstructing a terrorism investigation after allegedly deleting files from his computer

Scene: The apartment building where Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, was arrested shortly after 5 a.m., Friday, May 30, 2014, in Quincy, Mass. Matanov, a friend of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing suspectss, faces federal charges he destroyed, altered and falsified records, and made false statements to obstruct the investigation into the bombings

Concerned resident:  Elizabeth Feitelberg, a neighbor of Khairullozhon Matanov in Quincy, Massachusetts, said she heard two explosions in her neighbor in March and April of last year, right before the Boston Marathon bombings

The photographer reported both incidents to police, but only realized a possible connection to the bombings following the recent arrest of Matanov, who lives nearby.

'I thought it's probably not a coincidence if the people that did what they did in Boston wanted to practice or do stuff ahead of time,' she told My Fox Boston.

Feitelberg’s husband told FOX 25 that he remembers what he called a loud helicopter or planes flying over the neighborhood last year.

A source told the Patriot Ledger that the FBI was using a drone-like plane to track Matanov's movements.

Police do not believe Matanov was directly linked to the bombings or that he had prior knowledge about them.

He has lived in the U.S. since 2010, when he arrived on a student visa. He was later granted permission to stay because of unrest in his home country.

At his court hearing on Friday, hours after police raided his apartment, Matanov wore a Levi's T-shirt and jeans as he entered no plea.

According to the indictment, seen by the Boston Globe, Matanov had been friends with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and allegedly joined him in activities such as 'discussing religious topics and hiking 
up a New Hampshire mountain in order to train like, and praise, the "mujahideen" [Islamic guerrillas]'.

After dining with the brothers a few hours after two devices had been detonated near the finish line of the marathon, in an attack that killed three and injured 260 others, Matanov appeared to show support for the bombings.

Nervous: An attorney for Matanov, who moved to the U.S. from Krygzstan in 2010, says his client is frightened by the charges

Suspects: Tamerlan, right, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, seen on security footage on the day of the attack. That night, they met Matanov for dinner

Arrest: Matanov was handcuffed and led away from this Quincy apartment at about 5.30am Friday

He allegedly told a witness the attack 'could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam,' the indictment said.

Cab driver Khairullozhon Matanov was friends with the Tsarnaev brothers before the Boston Marathon bombing.

He had joined older brother Tamerlan for a hike where they allegedly praised mujahideen.

On April 15, 2013, just 42 minutes after two bombs were detonated near the finish line of the marathon, Matanov called the brothers to invite them out for dinner.

An indictment claims that as a manhunt for the suspects - at this point still unidentified - got underway, Matanov spoke to the brothers on a cell phone.

On April 17, the 23-year-old from Krygyzstan visited Tamerlan at his home.

He first realized they were suspects when police released pictures of the brothers.

On April 18, Matanov allegedly tried to call Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered.

After the brothers were named as suspects, Matanov allegedly deleted 902 video files and 377 document files from his computer. 

He allegedly asked two people to take cell phones from him.

Early on in the investigation, Matanov was interviewed voluntarily by police.

On May 30, 2014, he was arrested at his apartment.

It added that he claimed 'he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and the victims had gone to paradise'.

It was only days later that he started to express sympathy for the victims, and say the bombings might have been wrong.

During this time he allegedly saw the brothers, suspected of being behind the attacks, a couple of times.

He allegedly tried to contact both Tamerlan and Dzhokhar twice on a cellphone, and saw Tamerlan in person on two occasions, including at the suspect's home on April 17.

According to the indictment, Matanov didn't realize his friends had been connected with the bombing until the FBI released pictures of them on April 18.

He allegedly tried to contact the brothers one last time, on the morning of April 19, when he called Dzhokhar's cellphone. No one answered.

At that point, Dzhokar was the focus of a massive manhunt, and his brother had already been shot dead by police.

After the brothers were named as the suspects, Matanov is accused of making false statements to investigators, and deleting files from his computer of 'violent content or calls to violence'.

He also allegedly tried to get two people to take cell phones from him, so they wouldn't be found when the FBI searched his apartment.

By deleting the files, the indictment says Matanov: 'Obstructed the FBI’s determination 
of his internet activity ... and the extent to which he shared the 
suspected bombers’ philosophical justification for violence, among other
 topics of interest'.

Connection: Brothers Tamerlan, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, knew Matanov

Refuge: After arriving in the U.S. on a student visa, Matanov was given residency because of unrest in his home country

Accusations: Matanov could face a lengthy prison term if he is found guilty of obstructing the investigation

Although he was interviewed voluntarily by a detective, Matanov allegedly made false statements to hide the extent of his friendship with the brothers.

Matanov, who has no family in the U.S., was described as being 'nervous and frightened' by his defense attorney, Ed Hayden.

'He had no intent to mislead the FBI and, from what I can see, whatever he did, didn’t impede the investigation,' Hayden told the Boston Globe.

Matanov has been charged with one count of destroying altering and falsifying records and documents, and three counts of making a false statement in a federal terrorism investigation.

Deadly: Runners head towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts on April 15, 2013

Forensic: Investigators survey the site of a bomb blast on Boylston Street a day after two explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013

If found guilty, the cab driver could face up to 20 years in prison for the first charge, and up to eight years for each of the three false statement charges.

He is being held without bail until a hearing, scheduled to be held on Wednesday.

Matanov is the fifth person to face charges surrounding the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is charged with carrying out the attack, and three of his university friends are facing charges over the alleged removal of a backpack and laptop from his dorm room.
