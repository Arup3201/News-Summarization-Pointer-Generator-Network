When Ivan Waterson was walking his dog on the beach, the last thing he expected was a three metre crocodile charging at them.

The 56-year-old, from Wulagi, north of Darwin in the Northern Territory, took his border collie named 'Friday' on their regular walks along Rapid Creek beach about 7pm on Sunday.

But after letting Friday go for a swim in the water to wash off the sand, Mr Waterson noticed just the eyes of a submerged saltwater crocodile about 30 metres from his dog and moving quickly toward him.

‘I couldn’t see what it was so I thought I’d check it out because it looked like a fish on the surface,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘They are very smart creatures and it had its whole body submerged the whole time and all you could see were those little eyes coming at you.

‘It was coming straight at us really fast and we had to run right off the sand before it spun around and went straight back into the water.'

Mr Waterson was walking back towards the bridge when he happened to turn around and notice the reptile before other beach goers alerted what they had saw.

‘People on the other side of the creek were screaming out: “Watch your dog!”,' he said.

‘It happened to stalk us at the time and it would have come from behind us and got the dog. If I hadn’t seen it, it would’ve been a whole different story.

‘I also warned the fishermen to get off the bank at the time because he was right on the edge of the water.'

The quick-thinking man noticed the submerged three-metre crocodile moving really quickly towards them from 30 metres away

But Mr Waterson said this wasn’t the first time the crocodile had 'targeted' the pair. Two months ago, he was walking with his wife, daughter and Friday, when they had a similar encounter.

‘Friday was chasing rocks under the water and we made sure he played in the shallow end.

'Just as we started walking back, my daughter said something in the water looked like a croc.

'We kept an eye on it and it didn't worry us too much but it started following us for a good 200 metres before it stopped and sort of sat there.

‘I did go back there after to take the dog for a run and as soon as it saw Friday, it made a beeline for him because it obviously wanted the dog - a dog is a bit of a delicacy for the crocs.'

A three-metre saltwater crocodile was spotted along Rapid Creek beach in Darwin on Sunday evening

Mr Waterson has been a regular Rapid Creek visitor for 15 years and said the incidents haven’t changed his mind about going back there.

‘It doesn’t stop me from going back there but I am always alert and aware,' he said.

Mr Waterson added: ‘What worries me are the kids who are playing near the water or new people who don’t have an understanding of swimming at the beach.

‘You need to be aware because they’re very fast creatures but the odds of taking someone is slim.

‘There have been two reports of crocs in the Rapid Creek area around this time of year but no one has been taken by one – they’d take a dog before taking anyone else.'
