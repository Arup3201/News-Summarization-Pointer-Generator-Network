Arsene Wenger has demanded that UEFA crack down hard on Manchester City for breaching financial fair play rules.

City were found to have violated FFP regulations — the rules set up to stop clubs spending more than they earn — and it is expected they will have their wage bill cut for their Champions League squad next season.

And Wenger said he will feel ‘let down’ if UEFA do not severely punish City and has called on the authorities to take serious action.

‘There are rules to apply for financial fair play,’ said Wenger, whose club posted a £6.7m profit earlier this year. ‘If you don’t respect them, you have to apply the rules.

‘One
 of the rules is that normally you should be banned for the excess of 
the financial amount that is not justified, that is if you are £100m 
overboard, you should be punished for £100m of your wages bill in the 
Champions League.

‘I want to
 see that respected, if that is not respected, then the financial fair 
play will have problems to be respected in the future because everyone 
will just not consider it at all.

‘If it is not respected, of course we will feel let down.’

There
 were initial suggestions that clubs could be banned from the Champions 
League if they broke the new rules, but Wenger believes UEFA have 
back-tracked on that so they do not risk jeopardising money from TV 
rights, especially since Paris St Germain have also violated FFP rules.

He
 added: ‘That has gone now, I have thought about that problem and the 
media might play a part in that, because when UEFA sells the rights of 
the Champions League to a French TV station, it is very difficult to 
explain to them once they have paid the money that the best club in 
their country will not play in the competition, so that might be one of 
the reasons behind that.’

In order that Arsenal stay within the financial rules, Wenger maintains that he will not be making huge changes to his squad.

The
 64-year-old will bring in two or three players in the summer, but is 
confident they have the nucleus to make minimal transfers in order to 
catch up with the top three.

‘It
 will be busy but the main thing for us will be to keep the stability 
because we feel we are close, we want to add something that makes us 
even stronger,’ he explained. ‘But number-wise it will not be massive.

‘At the moment I have people around me who start to look.

‘From my experience the World Cup years have always been very quiet until the end of the World Cup, with no players reachable.

‘Everybody is focused in the country on their national team and there’s not a lot happening, people are away.

‘I believe this year again you will have to wait until the July 15 to start going.’
