With paws in place of a shovel, this is the moment a determined cat burrows his way out of a snow-cased home.

James Gilfoy from Canada filmed his pet feline Rudider making a bid for freedom at the front door following a wintry storm.

With close to 4ft of ice blocking the entrance way, the pet makes a valiant effort before leaping up and making his great escape.

Rudiger starts by attacking the bottom section of snow with his paws.

As he pounds away, debris falls around him on the floor.

He then moves to another section and attempts the same tactic.

In the end, he decides digging a tunnel will be too much work. 

After a couple of attempts to jump up and over the blockage, he finally makes it out.

The fluffy animal is seen sniffing the chilly air and looking around at his white surroundings inquisitively. 

Many viewers have applauded Rudiger's snowplowing antics.

'That's one determined cat! Very cool,' one commenter wrote. Hopefully the snow has subsided making Rudiger's exit easier to navigate.

Too much to handle: With close to 4ft of ice blocking the entrance way, the pet makes a valiant effort before leaping up and making his great escape

Third time lucky: It takes him a few attempts to jump up and over the blockage
