This JIhadi fighter was today filmed claiming he is training British teenagers to fight in the Syrian war.

The Dutch man, known as Yilmaz, confirmed via Skype he had trained people as young as 16 to take part in the conflict, which has reportedly claimed the lives of more than 160,000 people so far.

Donning camouflage uniform with bullets strapped to his chest, he also insisted the majority of British fighters did not pose a threat to the UK.

This man, known as Yilmaz, was today filmed claiming he is training British teenagers to fight in the Syrian war

The Dutch fighter confirmed via Skype he had been training people as young as 16 to take part in the conflict. Above, a photo, posted to Tumblr, shows Yilmaz sat with another rebel in the town of Kasab in north-west Syria

But he told Sky News: 'There is always the chance of a loose cannon doing something stupid, doing something crazy.'

Yilmaz, who has been in Syria for two years, formerly served in the Dutch Army and worked in an old people's home in Holland.

Since his move, he has set up a Tumblr account to blog his experiences as a Jihadi fighter, on which he regularly posts digitally-altered photos of himself, weapons and his colleagues.

Bizarrely, he has also uploaded a number of images of cats curled up to pistols, rifles and grenades.

Speaking to Sky News, Yilmaz said the majority of British fighters did not pose a threat to their home country

But he added: 'There is always the chance of a loose cannon doing something stupid, doing something crazy.'

Yilmaz, who has been in Syria for two years, formerly served in the Dutch Army and worked in an old people's home in Holland. Since his move, he has set up a Tumblr account, on which he posted this photo of a cat

One image, posted on the site, shows Yilmaz stood on top of a tank holding a
 rifle. Its accompanying caption reads: 'We came here to fight, learn, 
grow and die.'

Meanwhile, another photo shows the 
fighter sat with another rebel in the town of Kasab in north-west Syria. Its caption states: 'Our last picture in Kasab! A few hours later, 
outmanned, outgunned and abandoned by various big groups we had to pull 
back.'

Yilmaz,
 who claims he supports terror group ISIS's aim to overthrow the Syrian government, 
today said it was 'extremely easy' for young Britons to travel to the 
war-torn country to fight.

Yilmaz also posted this digitally-altered image of a cat sat next to a rifle on the microblogging platform

This grey cat, cuddled up to a grenade, was among many posted on Tumblr by the Dutch Jihadi fighter

Speaking from the country's Idlib province, he said: 'It's
 extremely easy to get here … People go on holiday, they end up in 
Syria. What you need is a person that wants to go - and he'll find his 
way.

In addition to his Tumblr account, Yilmaz has set up an Ask.fm page where users can anonymously him questions.

So far, these have included:

Aleppo is soon going to be taken back by the regime, true?

'They are closing in, yes'

'Why are you not using Twitter?'

'I do not know'

'Rrrr, I love cats'

'Same here'

He has also posted a photo of his dinner on the site, comprising melon, beans and rice.

'It's
 funny, the British Government itself is funding and training, be it in 
Jordan or Syria, the Free Syrian Army. So the British Government is 
helping and I'm helping in my own way.'

Yilmaz told Sky News that the youngest of his British trainees were '16... 17... teenagers'.

He added that he knew he was could never return to his home country, but that being 'stuck' in Syria was 'all I ever wanted'.

The interview comes just two weeks after twin British schoolgirls sneaked away from their Manchester home in the middle of the night to travel to Syria.

Salma and Zahra Halane, who were star 
pupils with 28 GCSEs between them, were discovered missing from their 
beds by their 44-year-old mother.

They have now told their parents they have 
reached Syria – and have no intention of returning. It is believed they may have joined their brother, who is thought to have flown out to fight with ISIS last year.

In another image posted on Tumblr, Yilmaz is pictured stood on top of a tank donning camouflage uniform and holding a rifle. The photo's accompanying caption reads: 'We came here to fight, learn, grow and die'

Yilmaz uploaded this image of himself beheading a snake, alongside the caption: 'My first beheading in Syria!'

Meanwhile, three Muslims from Cardiff 
have recently appeared in an ISIS recruitment video from Syria, in which
 they urged other young Britons to join in the fight.

Nasser
 Muthana, who appeared in the film alongside his brother Aseel Muthana 
and Reyaad Khan, later posted online a photograph of an apparent collection of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.

Underneath the 
image, he wrote: ‘So the UK is afraid I come back with the skills I’ve 
gained.’

Yilmaz, who claims he supports ISIS's aim to overthrow the Syrian government, said it was 'extremely easy' for young Britons to travel to the war-torn country to fight. Above, Yilmaz and two companions hold up a flag

Last month, Home Secretary Theresa 
May said Islamist fighters had carved out a 'safe haven' in the Middle 
East - with 'advanced technology and weapons' capable of threatening the
 UK.

She said the terror threat was now 'on the doorstep of Europe' and was the most serious since 9/11.

She also revealed that women are among the 400 radicals that have left the UK to fight in Syria.

A man was today photographed carrying a baby as he rushed from an ambulance in the eastern Shaar neighborhood of the northern city of Aleppo.

Four barrel bombs were apparently dropped on the area by the Syrian airforce, injuring civilians and damaging homes, shops and other buildings.

It comes just days after elite government troops reportedly advanced in and around Aleppo in what appeared to be an attempt to lay siege to rebel-held parts in a 'major showdown'.

Aleppo, once Syria's commercial center, has been carved up into rebel-and government-controlled areas since an opposition offensive in mid-2012.

The push also came a month after extremist fighters of the Islamic State group seized territories straddling Syria and neighboring Iraq, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate. Most of the land was seized in June during a push across Iraq.

Abdurrahman and an activist based near the city who goes by the name of Abu al-Hassan said Monday's fighting was concentrated near an army base known as the Infantry Academy that rebels captured two years ago.

'The latest attack does not mean that Aleppo will fall. It is going to be a very difficult battle,' said Abdurrahman, whose group has a network of activists around the country.

He said the aim of government forces currently is to try capture Aleppo's northern district of Handarat to be able to further close in on rebels.

Syria's crisis began in March 2011 as largely peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's rule. It turned into an armed uprising after some opposition supporters picked up weapons to fight a brutal government crackdown on dissent.

It gradually became a civil war, in which more than 160,000 people have been killed, according to activists, and nearly a third of Syria's population of 23 million has been displaced

A third of those killed have been civilians.
