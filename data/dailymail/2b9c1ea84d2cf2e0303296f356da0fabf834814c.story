The mother of Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend, the model Irina Shayk, has allegedly suffered horrific burns after a fall at a Russian sauna.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s girlfriend, Irina Shayk, posted a picture of her mother’s back on Facebook showing horrific burns that she allegedly received after a fall at a Russian sauna.

The skin on her mother’s right shoulder and upper arm has been left blistered and painfully sore after an accident that Ms Shayk, 28, claims happened at a sauna in Emanzhelinsk.

Ms Shayk posted a picture of mother Olga Shaykhlislamova's back on Facebook, alleging that she fell over and crashed into an unguarded boiler.

Ms Shayk, the partner of Real Madrid’s star player for the past four years, posted the picture on her Facebook page and tweeted it.

She wrote: ‘I love my country but I feel so bad about things that happen there every day. My mother told this shocking story. She went to sauna, slipped on a wet floor and fall down on a red hot boiler which was not even fenced.’

‘She got second and third-degree burns and the worst part is that the owner of this sauna, Ermakov Stepan Nikolaevich, who is responsible for the safety of the guests, acted as if nothing happened!

‘I want to warn all people of Emanzhelinsk and guests of the town that they should avoid this place.And I ask the police and administration of Emanzhelinsk to check the safety conditions of the sauna "U Stepy", situated in Rabochi village.’

Ms Shayk’s career is on a definite upward trajectory having recently posed for American swimwear brand Beach Bunny.

The campaign is the latest in a series of career coups for the Russian model, who last year, appeared in editorial features in a host of prestigious magazines as well as on the cover of Spanish Vogue.

The model is also due to make her film debut later this year when she appears in Hercules: The Thracian Wars as Megara, the vengeful wife of the eponymous hero, played by The Rock.
