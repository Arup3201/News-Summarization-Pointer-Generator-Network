Luke Shaw told Southampton on the final day of the Premier League season that he wanted to join Manchester United.

The 18-year-old left-back's transfer to Old Trafford has been delayed due to his selection by England for the World Cup but a £27million move should go through after the tournament in Brazil.

Chelsea and Manchester City had hoped to hijack the deal but Shaw's mind was made up by May 11, according to the BBC.

Following Southampton's 1-1 draw with United on the final day of the season, Shaw told Saints bosses during a function at the team hotel of his intention to join the Red Devils this summer.

His actions are not dissimilar to those of Pascal Chimbonda, who infuriated Wigan by handing then boss Paul Jewell a transfer request while leaving the pitch following the final game of the season in 2006.

Shaw, however, has long been expected to leave Southampton this summer and join one of England's biggest clubs. Sportsmail broke the news that Shaw's move to United was all but a done on May 12.

But Southampton are temporarily digging in their heels over the move. The club are reluctant to sell before a new manager has been put in place at St Mary's. Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham last month.

Shaw had no choice but to put his move to United on hold until after the World Cup to concentrate on playing for England.

Despite finishing seventh in the Premier League last season, United have always been confident that they have won the race for for Shaw.

Shaw expects to get first-team football at Old Trafford and that clinched the deal. A powerful attacking asset, Shaw will replace France defender Patrice Evra.

Shaw is a boyhood Chelsea fan, but has decided he wants to pursue his career at United, despite Jose Mourinho's decision to let Ashley Cole leave Stamford Bridge this summer, which has opened a gap in their squad at left-back.

Shaw has already taken Cole's spot in the England squad for Brazil this summer, with Roy Hodgson opting to hand the youngster experience rather than take the man who won 107 international caps. 

Everton's Leighton Baines will be Hodgson's first-choice left-back this summer, however.
