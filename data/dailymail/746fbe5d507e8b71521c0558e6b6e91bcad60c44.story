This is the amazing moment an 87-year-old woman with Alzheimer's recognises her daughter and has a brief, lucid conversation. 

Kelly Gunderson, from Georgia, videoed the emotional encounter and uploaded it onto YouTube titled 'God's Gift', where it has been viewed almost 950,000 times over the past three days as the inspirational tale went viral on the internet.  

At the start of the video, Ms Gunderson's mother is visibly confused, initially thinking that her daughter is in fact her mother.

Ms Gunderson, from Georgia, United States, captioned the emotional video: 'My 87 year old mother with Alzheimer's knew who I was, even if just for a moment.'

In the short video, Ms Gunderson's mother is not certain who her daughter was. 

After a brief conversation, Ms Gunderson's mother realises that she is talking to her daughter. 

Mrs Gunderson said: 'Well I love Kelly. Didn't I name you Kelly. I love you Kelly.'

The 87-year-old then briefly tries to explain what she is thinking about, briefly putting her hand to her head. She said: 'My Lord, what am I thinking about?' 

Luckily, Mrs Gunderson's moment of clarity continues and she tells her daughter that she is currently thinking about her. 

She said: 'Well, I'm loving you.' 

'I'm loving you too momma.' 

'We're both doing the same thing... isn't it wonderful,' added Mrs Gunderson.
