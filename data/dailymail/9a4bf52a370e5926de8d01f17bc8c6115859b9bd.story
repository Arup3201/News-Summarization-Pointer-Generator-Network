Andy Murray stormed into the Valencia Open final by beating David Ferrer for the second time in a week — and took a huge step towards qualifying for next month’s World Tour Finals.

Murray, enjoying a stunning end to the year, won 6-4, 7-5 to reach his third final in less than a month.

And after victories in Shenzhen and also in Vienna last Sunday — when he beat Ferrer in a three-set thriller — he is just one success away from a 31st career title and the chance to breathe easier in the Race to London.

*Standings on Saturday October 25

Murray, who is playing for the fifth week in a row, said: ‘After the US Open (last month) I was aware that I would need to win a lot of matches to reach the Tour Finals. So it was important for me to get as many matches as I can against the top players between now and the end of the year.’

Murray arrived in Spain lying eighth in the World Tour Finals standings, with only the top eight qualifying for the grand event at the O2 Arena.

Rafael Nadal’s withdrawal on Friday means ninth place will now get a berth, though Murray is looking forward rather than over his shoulder thanks to his autumn return to form.

The Scot will move up to fifth in the race if he wins today’s final — against Tommy Robredo or Jeremy Chardy — and he will be the clear favourite given the way he held off Ferrer in just under two hours.

He could do with the extra points going into next week’s Paris Masters, the last qualifying event where the likes of Ferrer, Milos Raonic and Grigor Dimitrov will be planning one last assault on a place at the Tour Finals. Murray could face Dimitrov in the last 16 and Novak Djokovic in the last eight in the French capital.

This was Murray and Ferrer’s third meeting in three weeks, the Spaniard having won in Shanghai before the British No 1 avenged that loss a week ago in Austria.

Murray seemed to be cruising at 3-0 up in the second set but the Spanish baseliner, roared on by his home crowd, battled back superbly. Murray had to fend off three break points in his match-winning service game before he finally crunched a forehand to secure victory.

In Basle, Roger Federer defeated Ivo Karlovic 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a final against Belgian David Goffin, who beat Croatia’s Borna Coric 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.

Elsewhere, Serena Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki in a thrilling contest to reach her third consecutive final at the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore.

Wozniacki served for the match in the third set and led 4-1 in the deciding tie-break but Williams battled back.

The world No 1 will today face Simona Halep in the final after she beat Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-2. The Romanian crushed Williams 6-0, 6-2 in the group stage on Wednesday, a defeat the 33-year-old American admitted was ‘embarrassing’.
