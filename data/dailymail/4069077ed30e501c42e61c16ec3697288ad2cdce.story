A council is attempting to trace a tenant who caused thousands of pounds of damage to a house after keeping a pig inside the property.

Housing staff from Derby City Council found the Gloucester Old Spot roaming around the bottom floor of the property in Kingsley Street, Sinfin, Derbsyhire, when they went to evict the tenant following complaints from neighbours.

The carpets were muddied and covered in droppings, and rooms were so full of boxes of junk that officials could not get into them.

This little piggy stayed at home: This is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty

It is thought the pig had been kept at the house for a year. Officials also found a dog at the property.

One resident living in the same road 
said: 'I saw the man with the pig when it was tiny and he just had it in
 his hands outside the front of his home.

'I thought it was one of those micro-pigs which wouldn’t grow.'

Neighbours think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000

Some residents reported smelling urine around the property when the weather was warm.

Two Shetland ponies were known, by the RSPCA, to have previously been kept in the small back garden.

Another resident said: 'He used to 
chuck stuff outside in the middle of the night and once I saw laminate 
flooring soaked in poo and urine piled up outside the home.'

Derby Homes, which manages council 
housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that
 some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all.

Piles of junk was found in one of the bedrooms, left, while mud and muck covered the stairs, hallway and door

The front room with a dirty red leather sofa, faeces and piles of household junk stacked up on shelves

It said the cost of repairing the damage caused to the property would be between £10,000 to £15,000.

When housing officials and the RSPCA 
turned up to evict the tenant on March 15 after gaining an eviction 
notice from court, the tenant took the pig away.

Council officials are now trying to trace his whereabouts.

Derby Homes had been trying to get 
access to the property since September last year when the first 
complaint was made of a pony being kept in the rear garden and a pig 
being inside.

Although RSPCA and housing staff went out, the tenant would not allow them access.

The RSPCA visited again two months later and saw two ponies in the garden.

The officers warned the tenant that 
keeping the ponies at a domestic property was illegal. When they went 
back, the ponies had gone.

Fancy a bath? Derby Homes, which manages council housing in the city, said the tenant was an 'excessive hoarder' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all

Derby Homes began the legal process to
 get access to the home. Despite the court issuing an order for the 
tenant to allow access to housing staff, he failed to comply.

The court, therefore, granted an eviction notice and staff swooped on March 15.

A spokesman for Derby Homes said: 'We’ll try to trace the 
current whereabouts of the tenants and will pursue recovery of the costs
 of repair. The individual will not be eligible for housing with Derby 
Homes in the future. Thankfully, such cases are rare.'

The garden isn't much better full of old bits of wood, a barbecue. At one point there were two ponies in the garden

Maria Murphy, director of housing and 
customer service at Derby Homes, said: 'This is a disgraceful waste of 
money, caused by a tenant who failed to show respect for this property 
or his tenancy agreement.

'On top of the repair costs there is the cost of the office time and legal proceedings in gaining possession of this property.

'The tenant removed the pig and therefore no action was taken by the RSPCA.

'We are trying to trace the whereabouts of the tenant and will pursue the costs of repairs required at the property.

'The individual will not be eligible for housing with Derby Homes in the future.'

The house looks fairly respectable from outside but behind the front door it was full of disgusting rubbish
