Before the likes of Apple, Google and other pioneers of the technological world, 20th century inventors came up with novel and wacky ways of developing existing products.

Among the most bizarre ideas that never managed to take off include reading glasses fitted with mirrors and radio-fitted hats from the 1930s; an extendable caravan that made a stretch limousine look compact, and a car that could scoop pedestrians off the road to prevent them from being run over.

Other inventions include a vending machine that served hot sausages in Germany and a contraption that shut out all outside noise and was fitted with an oxygen mask to ensure the wearer didn't suffocate.

These Hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 and were designed to make it easier for people to read in bed. The words from the page were beamed to the reader's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and now have to strain their neck

Forget the stretch limo, this invention from 1934 is a stretch caravan. It was designed by a French engineer and comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was being towed. When the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite, the caravan could be extended to provide extra living space

In 1924, swimwear was fitted with wooden panels as safety devices. The wood was naturally buoyant and were designed to stop wearers from drowning

Yet despite these early inventors' forward-thinking, many of these creations never made it into the mainstream.

The pioneering radio hat designed in the U.S in 1931 comprised of a boater hat fitted with a transmitter and speaker, allowing the wearer to take the news with them wherever they go. 

A more ambitious way of using the relatively new wireless radio technology was in the 1921 radio pram.

It was fitted with a transmitter and meant parents could keep up with news and current affairs while walking their child. The radio could also be used to soothe the baby's crying

For people who preferred reading rather than listening to the radio, a pair of Hamblin glasses were invented in 
1936 designed to make it easier for people to read in bed.

The 
words from the page were beamed to the reader's eyes using mirrors so 
the reader could lie on their back and not have to strain their neck.

Many of the other historical brainwaves of the early 20th century involved inventors' taking transportation at the time and making it more efficient or useful.

A French inventor created an amphibious bicycle that let the user navigate land and sea using bulbous floats combined with wheels.

The 1924 Wooden Swimsuit allowed wearers to swim safely because the wooden panels were naturally buoyant and would keep them afloat.

Following the invention of the wireless, inventors in the U.S took the technology a step further. The radio headwear, left, was invented in 1931 and comprised of a boater hat fitted with a radio transmitter and a speaker.  While the radio pram from 1921, right, was equipped with a transmitter that could be used to soothe the baby as it slept

Before radar equipment became more mainstream, an inventor in the 1940s came up with this novel way of trying to listen for enemies. The dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds, which became louder as they moved through the tunnels. The user could then listen into by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits

Italian Goventosa de Udine’s harebrained idea for a one-wheeled motorcycle was conceived in 1931 and enabled the rider to hit speeds of 150 kilometers per hour. 

Forget the stretch limo, in 1934 one French engineer invented the stretch caravan. It comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was 
being towed.

When the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite, the caravan
 could be extended to provide extra living space.

Another wacky design to come from the same decade may have been one of 
the first off-road vehicles. Invented in 1936, the truck was fitted with ten wheels and each tyre sat at slightly different angles.

This meant it could drive across
 all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient.

Another take on the design of cars at the start of the 20th Century, this vehicle was fitted with a safety scoop to prevent pedestrians from being run over. It was designed in France and this picture dates back to 1924

Transport safety was also a key 
concern and in 1920s Paris, inventors came up with a scoop to attach to 
the front of cars which meant that if a pedestrian were hit they would 
be safely scooped up into the net.

All
 the noise of the city too much for you? How about slipping into Hug 
Gernsback’s 1925 invention, The Isolator. This contraption 
was designed to eliminate all outside noise and isolate the user in a 
peaceful working environment.

It came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer wouldn’t suffocate.

Later in the century, before radar equipment became mainstream, an inventor in the 1940s came up with a novel way of trying to listen for enemies.

Large dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds, which became louder as they moved through attached tunnels.

The user could then listen in by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits.

It came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer wouldn't suffocate. The invention on the right is an early, German take on the vending machine from 1931 that served hot sausages rather than fizzy drinks
