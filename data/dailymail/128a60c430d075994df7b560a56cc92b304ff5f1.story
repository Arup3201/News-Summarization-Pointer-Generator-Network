Lothario: Former Greater Manchester Police chief Michael Todd had a string of affairs

Police officials are examining new claims of financial malpractice against a senior officer exposed as a love cheat who also made sexually explicit videos of his mistresses.

Greater Manchester's new Police Commissioner has appealed for information about Michael Todd, former chief constable of the force, who had 'liasions' with 38 women in six years.

The claims centre on Todd's role in drawing up unique contracts that allowed some staff to get enormous payoffs when they left the force.

Married father-of-three Todd, 50, was found dead in mysterious circumstances on Mount Snowdon in 2008 after taking a cocktail of drink and sleeping tablets.

An inquest ruled that he did not commit suicide but died of exposure while his mind was in turmoil.

An inquiry questioned his 'judgment and integrity' and revealed he was linked to at least five women in the force - but said his private life did not affect his duties. It also cleared him of any misdemeanour in promotion of staff, and of inappropriate behaviour regarding expenses, hospitality, accommodation.

But now Tony Lloyd, a former Labour Foreign Office minister who has just been elected Police Commissioner for the force, is to be handed a report into allegations of possible financial malpractice, including 'golden goodbye' redundancy packages of up to £300,000.

According to The Sunday Telegraph, the West Midlands Inquiry into Todd failed to make crucial evidence public. The report contained details of Todd's computer, which contained sexually 
explicit videos of his lovers, some of who were Greater Manchester police staff.

A separate inquiry is now examining claims that the late police chief helped several employees - with whom he was romantically linked - to gain promotions or pay offs. These payoffs were then hidden in the force's accounts, The Sunday Telegraph reports.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing against those who received the payments.

Supt Alan Greene, head of the Great 
Manchester branch of the Superintendents' Association, told the newspaper: 'These concerns were dismissed.

'Spending such monies, way in 
excess of any normal redundancy certainly needs to be scrutinised and 
its right that the police authority is doing so.'

At the time of his death Todd - who was married to wife Carolyn - believed that his three-year affair with Angie Robinson, the head of Manchester Chamber of Commerce, was about to be exposed.

As well as impacting on his family, this would have revealed his failure to adhere to police vetting procedures requiring him to disclose changes in his circumstances to prevent blackmail.

Commissioner Tony Lloyd, a former Labour
minister, is awaiting a report on the allegations, and said: 'If 
police officers or anyone else have evidence of criminal offences I 
would urge them to come forward.'

Greater Manchester Police has so far failed to return calls to MailOnline.

The redundancy packages said to be under examination include those given to Cathy Butterworth, 53, and Christine Brereton - although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing or that either were ever romantically involved with Todd.

Ms Butterworth, who went from being a clerk at Rochdale police station to director of development earning £87,000 a year under Todd's leadership, apparently received a £117,000 pay off. The Sunday Telegraph quoted sources who claimed the total package was worth around £300,000.

Ms Brereton, who was head of human resources and earned a £87,000 salary, received a £105,000 deal.

Both packages were described as 'termination payments' and are much larger than the 'redundancy payments' given to others.

These include the force's IT director, who earned £85,00 annually but got a pay out of £40,030, and the director of diversity, who was on £74,000-a-year but received £10,210.
