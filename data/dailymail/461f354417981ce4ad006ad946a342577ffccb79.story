A pilot in Florida is lucky to be alive after a bird smashed through his windshield and struck him in the face, sending shards of glass flying into the cockpit.

Robert Weber was flying his Piper Saratoga around 10 miles from Page Field airport near Fort Myers in the southwest of the state, when the bird flew straight into his pilot-side window.

Remarkable footage taken by his cockpit camera shows the bird exploding on contact with the windscreen, as Mr Weber struggles to maintain control his light aircraft.

The goose-sized bird has not yet been identified but body parts found in the cabin, including a leg, are now being analyzed.

Crash: A pilot from Florida is lucky to be alive after a bird smashed through his windscreen and struck him the face sending shards of glass and feathers flying through the cockpit

Moment of impact: The windshield shattered, feathers scattered, and something scraped across his forehead as his sunglasses tore from his face

Debris: Glass and feathers fly through the cockpit about 1,000 feet up and traveling at 170 mph with a broken windshield

Speaking to reporters and still bearing a cut to his forehead that he suffered in the strike, Mr Weber explained how he managed to keep his composure and safely land the plane.

'The windscreen just exploded,' he said. 'First thing that came to mind was the first thing I was told when I started flying, and that was 'just fly the f---ing plane'.

Describing the moment the bird slammed through the glass, Mr Weber said it was 'sheer panic.'

It all happened in the blink of an eye as Mr Weber was flying at 170 mph when a bird crashed through the glass.

Glad to be on the ground: Robert Weber with his wife. He has been flying for eleven years

Lucky to be alive: Mr Weber suffered a cut to his forehead escaped serious injury

Close call: Imagine flying this plane with the wind in your face at 170mph, 1,000ft above the ground!

Perfect landing: Around five minutes after the bird strike, Mr Weber managed to safely land his plane

In a split second, the window was gone and blood was everywhere.

Mr Weber radioed for an emergency, as the entire incident was caught  on camera.

'You're sitting there waiting for a bird to come in. Never did see him. All of the sudden the window just explodes. I don't know if he was diving or what happened when I got him,' he said.

'I declared an emergency and I got it down as quickly as I could.'

A 1,000ft up, all Mr Weber says he could do was hold to hold on tight and fly his plane as glass and feathers flew throughout the cockpit.

He suffered a cut on his forehead, but refused medical assistance after a perfect landing.

Mr Weber says he was lucky he wasn't knocked out in the accident because he was the only person on board.

'I fully expected to find the rest of the bird when I landed,' he said. 'All I found were my glasses.'

The only part recovered was the birdâ€™s leg and some feathers, which will be used to identify what type of bird hit the plane, he said.

All that remains: Just a tiny leg and a few feathers were all that was left of the bird after the strike above Florida

No chance: Blood can be seen on the metal frame of the aircraft

Grounded: Mr Weber will need a new windscreen before he can take to the friendly skies once again
