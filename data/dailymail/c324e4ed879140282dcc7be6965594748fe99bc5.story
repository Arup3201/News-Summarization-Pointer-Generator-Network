A California high school was brought to a standstill on Monday after staff reported a suspicious package that had been left unattended on the grounds.

However after all major precautions were taken - with the campus evacuated and the bomb squad called in to destroy the box - it turned out to be nothing more than some vouchers from KFC.

Officials at Willows High School in Glenn County - north of Sacramento -  said they handled the situation a little more drastically than usual after multiple threats were made again the school last week. 

Suspicious: A package found unattended at Willows High School in Glenn County - north of Sacramento - on Monday and was subsequently destroyed by the bomb squad turned out to be a box of KFC coupons

The threats were allegedly made by three students on social media.

Willows High School Principal Holly McLaughlin filed a police report about the three - a 16-year-old male and two females, aged 16 and 17 - after discovering the threats on Twitter.

They were posted after a large group staged a protest at the school on Thursday. 

Instead of going to class at the start of the day, dozens of students took part in a sit-in in the hallway.

They were attempting to show support for two popular teachers, Paul Gadbois and Paul Bailey, who had recently lost their jobs.

'Things sort of blew up on social media after the board meeting,' Principal Holly McLaughlin told CBS Sacramento. 

Administrators say the principal, school board members and their children were threatened on social media.

'It kinda makes you nervous and makes you not wanna go to school at all,' said Willows High junior Ashlynn Geiger, who is the daughter of a school board member.

Protest: On Thursday students stayed a sit-in after two popular teachers lost their jobs

On the back of the threats, the staff became worried when they found the unmarked box outside the school entrance on Monday.

Police were notified, and initial exams of the package deemed it suspicious.  

'It looked suspicious when they did the x-ray,' said Sgt. Troy McIntrye.

The premises were evacuated and the bomb squad was called.

They destroyed the box, but afterwards realized it was just a collection of coupons from a local KFC.

Police do not think it had anything to do with the threats.

Principal McLaughlin admitted that, had it been a regular day at the school, a staff member would have likely just opened the box, however they were all on alert.
