Germany boss Joachim Low has warned his players they have gone from hunter to prey since winning the World Cup.

Low's men head into Euro 2016 battle with the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday evening having surrendered a 33-game unbeaten running in qualifiers with a 2-0 defeat in Poland on Saturday, a result which followed a friendly loss to Argentina and a narrow Group D victory over Scotland.

But while the manager insists the weight of success is not a burden for his team, he admits the label does serve to inspire whoever they come up against.

Joachim Low's German side have posted some average results since their World Cup victory in Brazil  

Low said: 'The difficulties we are experiencing at the moment are of a type that we have experienced many times before. But generally speaking, I don't think the position now is anymore difficult than it's always been.

'We used to be the hunter; now we are the prey. We know that teams like Scotland will play with incredible motivation against us - but that was true even after [the World Cup in] 2010 and [Euro] 2012.

'We know the situation, we know how to get by it, but it's no different now than it used to be.'

Germany remain overwhelming favourites to top the group and will expect to right the wrongs of Warsaw in comprehensive style against an Ireland team which has collected maximum points from a trip to Georgia and a 7-0 demolition of Gibraltar.

Low said: 'If you ask me what is the mood like now, fury is the wrong word, anger is the wrong word. But what you can feel is some kind of determination, that we really badly want these three points against Ireland.

'But there is no incredible disappointment in the team. That would be wrong to say.

'We have seen both the Irish games and have analysed them, and we can expect some sort of copy of Poland. There's nothing new to us. The Irish are good fighters, they have commitment and fantastic fighting spirit, and they know how to defend.

'They are a very well organised team, but at the same time, they have excellent players, like Robbie Keane, who is very experienced and has an eye for goal, Aiden McGeady, James McClean and other players who come from the wings and are very good at dribbling around their opponents.

'Like Poland, they are very fast on the counter, coming from the wings and putting dangerous crosses in.

'They come to Germany with self-confidence and with three teams being able to qualify from this group, they are in with a more than reasonable chance of actually making it to France.'

Schalke striker Julian Draxler is set to be named in Low's starting line-up to face the Republic of Ireland 

Low insisted he would not make too many changes to his team, although Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer will be missing through illness with Schalke's Julian Draxler expected to be drafted in on his home ground after himself shaking off a virus.

Draxler said: 'We want people to forget the defeat against Poland. As a footballer, you want to win every game.

'The last thing you do is sit down looking at the table and try to pre-conceive, 'We can afford to lose this one, we can afford to lose that one and still make it'.

'If you are a professional player, you want to win everything, so we feel we need to prove to our fans we can still win games.

'We are reigning world champions. Even if we lost a game, we still are title-holders and we are all fully there. We want to show the world that we would like to reach unbeatable status as quickly as possible.'

Low has cited Everton winger Aiden McGeady as one of the Republic of Ireland's main attacking threats 

Much of the concern in Germany over the current team surrounds the full-backs with Philipp Lahm's international retirement in particular leaving a gaping hole at the back, and youngsters Erik Durm and Antonio Rudiger have found themselves under intense scrutiny.

But Low said: 'Philipp Lahm played in the position for many, many years and he showed world class both on the right and on the left.

'It was obvious it would be difficult to replace somebody like him on a one-to-one basis. That is a fantasy.'
