Adrian Lewis hit the first nine-darter of the 2015 World Darts Championship at the Alexandra Palace before going on to lose against Raymond van Barneveld.

Jackpot won the £10,000 prize money for the feat at the Ally Pally, the second time he has inflicted nine perfect darts against Van Barneveld and the third televised of his career.

The 29-year-old hit a nine-darter in this tournament against Gary Anderson in the 2011 final before going on to become world champion, but it did little good on Tuesday night as he lost 4-3 against the resilient Dutchman.

Lewis achieved his latest and third of 2014, following two in Players Championship events, by hitting two 180s before finishing with treble, 20, treble 19 and double 12 in front of a 2,500-strong crowd in north London.

The two-time world champion turned to the crowd, put his hands in his pockets and shrugged his shoulders, before Van Barneveld hugged his opponent as they walked away from the oche for the first break after Jackpot took the opening set.

But Barney came from behind three times to win 4-3 and book his place in the quarter-finals, which will be played on January 2. 

'What a game,' Van Barneveld said. 'The first set of the match was probably the best I've played so far then Aidey got a nine-darter. I thought, hold on, if this is the standard what can I do?

'I'm thinking just keep believing. I saw Aidey was struggling. He didn't hit trebles anymore. I don't know what to say, I'm so happy. I'm a five-time world champion, Aidey in the last couple of years has been amazing. I don't know what to say, I'm so happy.'

Nine-darters used to be better rewarded than they are now, with Phil Taylor taking £100,000 for his first in 2002 and 501 bottles of Budweiser for two others in 2004 and 2005.

Jackpot’s £10,000 bonus may be modest in comparison but it takes him to fourth in the all-time list of televised nine-darters behind The Power, Van Barneveld and Michael van Gerwen.

The £10,000 will be shared, too, if another player hits a nine-darter during the remainder of the tournament, which concludes with the final on January 4, where the winner will receive £250,000. 

The nine-darter also means Haven House Children’s Hospice, the official charity of the PDC, and Parkinson’s UK, supported by Sky Sports presenter Dave Clarke, will received £9,000 each from William Hill.
