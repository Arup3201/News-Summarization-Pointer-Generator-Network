A NSW father who allegedly gave his 12-year-old daughter sex advice and arranged an illegal marriage between her and a 26-year-old man has been granted bail.

The 61-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14.

Police said the young girl's father facilitated the sexual assault of his daughter by actively arranging the unlawful marriage in NSW in January 2014 by allowing the pair to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before an Islamic ceremony took place in the living room.

The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police said.

The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'.

The 26-year-old Lebanese man, who has had his student visa cancelled and been placed in immigration detention, has already been charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years.

Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 26-year-old University of Newcastle student in November 2013 after he approached her father and expressed a wish to meet her.

A week after the wedding the father allegedly asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home, the court heard in May.

He also asked the girl, now aged 13, if she needed to shower before morning prayer on one occasion, documents show.

It also states that since the marriage the pair have engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis.

The father is due to reappear at Burwood Local Court on July 21.
