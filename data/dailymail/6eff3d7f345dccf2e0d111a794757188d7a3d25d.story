A doctor attacked her children's nanny because she thought the youngsters had been abandoned in the street, a court heard yesterday.

Dr Ping Zhu, 57, allegedly launched an attack on Rebecca Forsyth before smashing the hired help's BlackBerry mobile phone.

The row was so fierce that police were called to break up the row, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

Dr Ping Zhu denied assault and criminal damages when she appeared in court yesterday

Chinese-born Zhu denied assault and criminal damage when she appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

She was picking up her children from their father's home in in Bayswater, west London, at the time of the alleged attack last November 12.

The doctor is said to have snapped because she believed Ms Forsyth had abandoned her duties and left her children alone.

The ensuing fight was reportedly witnessed by bystanders and the court was told police attended the scene.

Wearing a bright pink scarf and clutching a designer handbag, Zhu spoke from the dock only to confirm her identity.

She denies the assault ever took place or that she was responsible for Ms Forsyth's broken phone.

The doctor was released on unconditional bail until her trial on March 18, when her nine-year-old son is due to be called as a witness.

Zhu, of Holland Park, west London, pleaded not guilty to assault by beating and criminal damage.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
