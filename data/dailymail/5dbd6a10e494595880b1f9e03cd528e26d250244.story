A belief in contagion raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as John F. Kennedy, (pictured) a study claims

Most people think they pay little attention to magic in modern times.

But a new study has shown that when it comes to celebrities, plenty of people subscribe to the rich and famous instilling everyday objects with their magical ‘essence’.

A belief in contagion – magical thinking in which a person’s qualities can be transferred to an object – raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as John F. Kennedy but lowers them for criminals and fraudsters, researchers claim.

Two psychologists at Yale University set out to find how the belief in contagion influences the sale of celebrity memorabilia.

Using data from three high-profile estate auctions, George Newman and Paul Bloom found that people’s expectations about the amount of physical contact between an object and a celebrity positively predicts the final bids for items that belonged to well-liked individuals such as President Kennedy.

Essentially, people were willing to pay more for items owned by liked celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, if they had touched them a lot.

The study in PNAS revealed that contagion negatively predicts final bids for items that belonged to disliked individuals, such as financial fraudster Bernard Madoff.

The researchers wrote: ‘Contagion is a form of magical thinking in which people believe that a person's immaterial qualities or essence can be transferred to an object through physical contact’ and concluded the belief suggests ‘that magical thinking may still have effects in contemporary western societies.’

Volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it belonged to a celebrity they admired as well as one they disliked.

People were prepared to pay almost 15 per cent less for a jumper worn by a celebrity if it had been sterilised - destroying the contagion effect.

They would pay almost 9 per cent less for a jumper that they were not allowed to resell, indicating that most people value the celebrity ‘essence’ attached to an item, more than its cash value.

However, sterilisation boosted the value of a jumper owned by a hated celebrity.

Sterilised items that had belonged to an unpopular celebrity were valued around 17 per cent more valuable than those that had not.

Drs Newman and Bloom looked at auction prices of 1,297 JFK-related items as well as 288 items said to have been owned by Marilyn Monroe and 489 related to Bernard Madoff.

Descriptions of auction items rarely say whether the item was touched by its owner, so the participants of the study rated how much contact they thought each item might have had with its owner on a scale of one to eight, Smithsonian reported.

The psychologists reasoned that people sitting in an auction house subconsciously do the same thing.

They discovered a strong link between items thought to have been frequently used by a celebrity - such as a fork or a watch – and the price of items that exceeded auction houses’ estimates of how much an object would fetch.

The only exception to their findings were prices paid for incredibly expensive items such as jewellery.

For items valued over $10,000, people did not pay any more or less based upon the amount of contact a celebrity might have had with them, indicating that the contagion effect does not influence serious investments.

The duo also conducted an experiment where 435 volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it had belonged to a celebrity they like as well as one that they hate.

‘When asked to bid on a sweater owned by a well-liked celebrity, participants report that they would pay substantially less if it was sterilised before they received it,’ destroying the magical contagion effect and a celebrity’s ‘essence’, the psychologists wrote.

‘However, sterilisation increases the amount they would pay for a sweater owned by a disliked celebrity,’ the researchers said.
