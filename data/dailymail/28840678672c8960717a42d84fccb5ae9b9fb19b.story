An Argentinian town has become the first in the country to ban beauty contests calling them sexist and discriminatory.

The pageants are popular in the South American country and often lead to winners gaining greater fame and fortune.

But in the city of Chivilcoy, in the province of Buenos Aires, have said they will no longer crown a queen based on her physical appearance.

Making a stand: Beauty pageants are popular in the South America but one city has decided they won't hold the competition anymore

Damaging: The city of Chivilcoy say the beauty pageants they have previously held 'reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance, based on stereotypes'

They say the practice is damaging to women as it forces them to live up to a 'stereotypical' ideal of beauty which can lead to them developing eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. 

The ruling has caused heated debate in the country where beauty pageants are a common element in regional festivals where a 'queen' is chosen to represent the town for a year. 

Women who participate are usually between 15 and 25-years-old and are judged on categories such as 'beauty', 'personality', and 'poise' after parading in a number of outfits including swimsuits. 

The new legislation was put forward by the Gender Secretariat and the Assembly for Children's Rights of the local branch of the Argentine Workers' Union (CTA).

Success: Members of the group who lobbied for beauty contests to be banned

In the past: From now on, young people in Chivilcoy will be rewarded for their efforts in the community rather than for their looks

It was supported by the mayor of Chivilcoy and several NGOs, and passed by the local council by 12 votes and five abstentions out of the 17 councillors present during the debate. 

Outlining the reasons for its decision they said that such contests 'reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance, based on stereotypes'. 

They added that they are 'a discriminatory and sexist practice', and an 'act of symbolic and institutional violence against women and children.'

Banned: Miss World was crowned earlier this month but one city in Argentina has decided they won't hold a similar beauty pageant from now on

'Sexist practice': The Chivilcoy council warned that rewarding women for beauty over achievements can lead to eating disorder

Instead, the beauty pageant traditionally carried out as part of the celebrations for the anniversary of the foundation of the city will be replaced by an event celebrating the achievements of young people and the difference they have made to the community.

They stated that the new contest would be for 'people between 15 and 30 years who, in an individual or collective way, have stood out in volunteering activities aimed at improving the quality of life in neighbourhoods within the city or the district.'

Claudia Marengo of the local CTA branch said of the decision to ban beauty pageants: 'It's a very important achievement. It has an enormous symbolic value. The municipal state made the decision, within the framework of this bill, to stop subjecting the women of Chivilcoy to the exhibition, objectification, and selection that beauty pageants imply, with the added bonus that instead they will promote other values that aim to encourage the construction of citizenship with a gender equality.'

Last September, the French government banned beauty contests for children under the age of 16 on grounds that participants are subjected to hyper-sexualisation.

More than just a pretty face: This year's Miss World winner, Rolene Strauss, 22, from South Africa, is a bilingual medical student

In a similar move, Russian MPs proposed a ban on child beauty pageants as they harm children physically, psychologically and intellectually.

More recently the organisers of the most famous beauty pageant of all - Miss World - announced they will no longer have a swimsuit round in the competition.

In an interview with Elle, chairwoman Julia Morley explained: 'I really... don't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis. It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn't do anything for any of us.'

She added: 'I don't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's. We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.'

The motto of the competition - which started in the Fifties - is 'beauty with a purpose'. They encourage participants to support and get involved in charity projects and prove they have brains as well as beauty.

'Beauty with purpose': Rolene said she wants to use her position to promote education

Modernising: Miss World has announced they are now dropping their swimsuit round which as been part of the pageant for decades

This was illustrated by their year's winner, Rolene Strauss from South Africa, who was crowned Miss World earlier this month. The 22-year-old is a bilingual medical student who wants to use her position to promote the importance of a good education.

She said: 'I am what I am today because of the opportunities I have received and I would love to give others the same opportunities; educating, the opportunity to be educated, to make healthy choices and also to live their dreams.

'As Miss World, people look up to you and see you as an independent, strong woman. That's the picture I'd like to show people out there.'
