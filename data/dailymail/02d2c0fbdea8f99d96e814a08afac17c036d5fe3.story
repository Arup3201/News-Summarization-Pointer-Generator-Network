Vauxhall gave the economy a huge boost yesterday when its car workers were judged to be more efficient, hard-working and flexible than their counterparts in a Germany wrestling with the euro-crisis.

The verdict came from American parent company General Motors as it saved Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire from closure and made it the lead plant in Europe to manufacture the next generation Astra from 2015.

It means £125million of new investment and 700 extra jobs on top of the 2,100 already secured.

With the UK enjoying a car exports boom, up to 3,000 more jobs at suppliers could be generated as Vauxhall raises the amount of British-sourced components in the Astra.

The plant will build the five-door Astra hatchback plus one variant – either the Sports Tourer estate or the sporty GTC – with production soaring from 140,000 a year now to 160,000 and up to a capacity of 225,000.

Vauxhall beat German counterparts thanks to a ‘ground-breaking’ round-the-clock flexibility deal.

It spells extra shifts, weekend working and the end of the ‘traditional’ long summer shutdown as well as a two-year pay freeze from 2013 followed by two years of real terms increases of RPI inflation plus 1 per cent.

The move was hailed by the Prime Minister, business leaders and unions as ‘a vote of confidence’ in British workers and the economy.

It marks the latest triumph for the booming UK motor industry which for the first time since 1976 is exporting more cars than it imports.

David Cameron praised the ‘team effort’ of employees, unions, managers and ministers in keeping production in the UK.

Business Secretary Vince Cable, who flew to Detroit in March to put the case for Vauxhall to GM bosses, said it was ‘fantastic news’.

He added: ‘The fact that big American car companies are making big investments in Britain is a good signal.’

Vauxhall bosses called it ‘a historic day’.

The good news came as motor industry figures showed a near 10 per cent rise in the number of cars built in Britain in April compared with a year ago.

The figures were boosted by strong export demand for the likes of Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mini, Nissan, Honda and Toyota.

The turnaround follows significant car industry investment in the UK topping £4billion in 18 months.

The General Motors decision on Ellesmere Port means the plant will be exporting Astras to Germany where production of the best-selling small family car will cease altogether.

That marks the death-knell for GM’s German factory in Bochum – employing up to 3,200 people – which was competing with the British plant.

Ellesmere Port and Gliwice in Poland will now become the only two manufacturing centres for the Astra.

The deal also turns on its head the notion that British plants are first in line for closure because their ‘flexibility’ means they are easier and cheaper to shut than those in Germany where the cost of laying off workers is significantly more expensive.
