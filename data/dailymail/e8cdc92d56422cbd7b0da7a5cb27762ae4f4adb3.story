The biggest payday loan firms have been threatened with closure over the misery and hardship caused by irresponsible or illegal lending.

They include market leader Wonga, which has links to David Cameron’s office and the Tories.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) yesterday gave the 50 firms a deadline of just 12 weeks to clean up their act or lose their credit licences.

The firms, which have been dubbed ‘legal loan sharks’, lend more than £2billion a year and target the vulnerable with interest rates of more than 4,000 per cent.

Many who initially borrow small sums are encouraged to roll these over several times and end up owing more than they can afford.

The watchdog’s chief executive, Clive Maxwell, said: ‘We have found fundamental problems with the way the payday market works and widespread breaches of the law and regulations, causing misery and hardship for many borrowers.

‘Irresponsible lending is not confined to a few rogue payday lenders – it is a problem across the sector.

‘If we do not see rapid, significant improvements by the 50 lenders we inspected they risk their licences being removed.’ The firms under investigation are responsible for 90 per cent of loans.

The OFT is also referring the industry to the Competition Commission, which has powers to recommend new laws and regulation.

The Treasury and Department for Business tried to pre-empt the damning OFT report by announcing a range of measures it said would ensure a fair deal for consumers.

These include large fines for those that mislead or mistreat customers, but there was no pledge to cap punishing interest rates.

Regulation is being moved from the OFT, which is being scrapped, to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). But Sylvia Waycot, editor of Moneyfacts.co.uk, warned it will take at least a year before the FCA takes over this job. ‘Until then, those in financial difficulty will be dealing with what is largely a self-regulating industry,’ she said.

Consumer minister Jo Swinson said the OFT’s measures combined with the Government’s proposals would protect the public.

‘The evidence of the scale of unscrupulous behaviour by payday lenders and the impact on consumers is deeply concerning,’ she said.

‘The Government is committed to tough action to tackle these problems.’

The Consumer Finance Association, which speaks for loan  firms, said members are improving how they operate, and offered to ‘consider’ the Government’s proposals.

Chief executive Russell Hamblin-Boone said: ‘From credit-checking all new applications, to limiting loan rollovers and providing help for those who get into financial difficulty, we have raised standards all the way through the loan process.’

The fact that Wonga is among the loan firms savaged by the OFT could embarrass David Cameron and the Conservative Party.

The firm paid thousands of pounds for the right to have face-to-face lobbying time with senior Conservative politicians at the party’s annual conference in Birmingham last year.

Later a member of the Prime Minister’s inner circle, his digital adviser Jonathan Luff, joined Wonga, which has been lobbying against calls from some consumer groups for a cap on the industry’s sky-high interest rates. Yesterday’s announcement that there would be no such cap was ‘broadly welcomed’ by Wonga.

Wonga is keen to present itself as the acceptable face of payday lenders through its sponsorship of TV shows such as ITV’s Red or Black, which is fronted by Ant and Dec, and Newcastle United football club.

The business was founded in 2007 by two South Africans, Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz, both 43, and has thrived during the recession. It sold a record 2.5million loans – more than 6,000 a day – in 2011 and tripled its net income to £45.8million.

Mr Damelin is now said to be worth £34million, while Mr Hurwitz’s fortune is put at £25million.

Wonga refuses to give Mr Luff’s job title but he has been variously identified as head of public affairs and head of government affairs.
