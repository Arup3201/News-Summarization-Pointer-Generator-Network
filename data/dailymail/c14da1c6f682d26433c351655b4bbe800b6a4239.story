Two brothers have been jailed for life for decapitating a man after beating, stabbing and shooting him, then setting his corpse on fire.

Anthony and Joseph Jenkins killed John Grainger in January this year after the three had been drinking in various pubs in Stockport town centre.

A pathologist who later examined Mr Grainger’s body said the injuries were so severe his skull had 'largely distintegrated' and had 'essentially fallen to pieces.'

Mr Grainger, described by his family as 'very sociable and friendly', died in the frenzied attack at the brothers' flat after Anthony Jenkins was kicked out of a nightclub for spraying beer around the dancefloor.

Anthony Jenkins, 31, had pleaded guilty earlier in the trial, while his 30-year-old brother was today convicted of murder at Manchester Crown Court.

The pair were sentenced to life in prison and must serve a minimum of 30 years and 32 years respectively before they can be considered for parole.

Murder victim John Grainger was described as 'very sociable and friendly'

Tests showed that the pair had tried to saw Mr Grainger's head off with a bread knife before turning to a motorised saw during the attack in the early hours of January 26.

The court heard how Mr Grainger was severely beaten, hit on the head with a hammer, stabbed in the legs and was then shot in the knee and point blank in the head.

The brothers took his body to the bathroom where he was decapitated.

Earlier in the trial prosecuter Graham Reeds, QC told the court: 'Once dead his body was taken into a bathroom where it was decapitated. His head was put into a plastic shopping bag and his body into a plastic or canvas wheeled holdall.

'His body was then taken along with the head, a can of petrol and the gun, down two flights of stairs through the communal hallway and to a wooded area.

'This was a task for which two people were needed. John Grainger weighed around 12 stone 11 pounds. Once in the wood his body was set alight using petrol to accelerate the fire.'

The blaze was spotted by a casino worker on his way home and firefighters alerted police when they realised a body was on fire.

The Jenkins brothers were spotted acting suspiciously a kilometre away from their flat, having changed their clothes.

Police found six live shotgun cartridges in Anthony Jenkins' pocket and saw blood on his shoe.

They then received a radio message about the burning corpse and arrested the pair.

Police found large blood stains on the walls and furniture when they searched the flat on Wellington Street, Stockport.

The power saw the brothers used to decapitate Mr Grainger was covered in blood and still plugged into an extension lead.

The gun was found under a parked car nearby, while a hammer, butterfly knife, bread knife, Stanley knife and razor were found in the bath.

The Jenkins brothers had attempted to clean up with a mop and bucket of bleach. Their clothes were in the washing machine.

Joseph Jenkins had previously claimed that he went off with a woman after leaving the XXL nightclub, leaving the two other men.

When he returned to the flat, he told the court he found bloodstained clothes in the hallway and was shocked to be told by his brother: 'That lad John, I’ve done him.'

Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall from the Major Incident Team said: 'The Jenkins brothers put Mr Grainger through a horrifically violent and cruel attack before shooting him. What followed was nothing short of macabre.'

Chief Superintendent Chris Sykes from Greater Manchester Police’s Stockport Division said: 'The gap left by Mr Grainger’s untimely death has proved impossible to fill but I hope this sentence goes a little way in helping his loved ones get on with their lives.'
