Fans angered by the increasingly racy storylines in The Archers say their views are being censored by the BBC.

From next week, critics of the Radio 4 soap will be prevented from posting their views online when the show’s messageboard is shut down.

BBC bosses claim not enough people are using it, but fans have accused them of trying to censor their comments.

Critics of The Archers, who celebrate the 50th anniversary in 2001, pictured, say that the BBC is censoring their views

Heather Bell, who is pictured second on the right with the staff of the show in 1971, was the subject of criticism. The actress returned to the role of Clarrie Grundy, which she hasn't played since 1979

One angry listener said the BBC could not take‘constructive criticism’ while another said they were ‘insulting their most loyal customers’.

The online forum currently has 10,000 users and attracts posts from listeners all over the UK. But the comments posted have become increasingly critical as fans complained about ‘sexed-up’ storylines. One compared the cost of the messageboard with one of BBC1’s Saturday night shows, saying: ‘£22million on The Voice but they can’t keep our little community going.’

Others vented their anger on Twitter. One wrote: ‘BBC is closing down the Archers Message Board. Terribly sad, an insult to their most loyal customers.’

Explaining the decision in a blog, 
Radio 4 interactive editor Nigel Smith wrote: ‘Traffic to the 
messageboard has reduced greatly. While there are around 10,000 regular 
visitors the number of people who contribute actively has dropped below a
thousand.’

One particular Archers episode has 
been singled out for criticism. Based on the wartime film Brief 
Encounter, it was described by one listener as a ‘lame, utterly 
humourless parody’. Titles of discussion threads on the site include 
‘That really was a new low...’ and ‘Worst Episode Ever’.

There
has also been criticism of this week’s return of Heather Bell to the 
role of Clarrie Grundy, whom she last played in 1979. Miss Bell replaced
Rosalind Adams, who had played Clarrie for 25 years.

Other
fans have complained about continuity errors in the script and 
criticised scriptwriters. On Monday users of the service were informed 
that web discussion pages would be closed in two weeks because use of 
the site had ‘reduced greatly’.

They
were also told that the number of ‘active’ contributors had dropped and
that they should use Facebook or Twitter to talk about the programme.

Many
believe the decision to axe the service is due to the increasingly 
vocal criticisms on the messageboards about poor storylines and 
unhappiness at the general direction of the farming soap.

Following the announcement, hundreds used the messageboard to attack the BBC over the decision.

Fans are raising a petition which they hope to send to Culture Secretary Maria Miller in a bid to get the move reversed.

Underneath a posting directing fans to Mr Smith’s blog, there were more than 380 comments, most of them negative.

One read: ‘I can only conclude that the BBC does not like the way certain storylines have been received here.’
