England manager Roy Hodgson is about to name the 23 men he reckons have the best chance of ending almost 50 years of World Cup hurt - but it's a lady with a beard who has provided the greatest omen for the Three Lions.

Conchita Wurst was voted the best of the Eurovision Song Contest entries and won the competition for Austria for the first time since 1966.

Up for the cup: Conchita Wurst won the Eurovision Song Contest for Austria in Copenhagen this year

On top of the world: Bobby Moore led England to World Cup glory at Wembley in 1966Â 

Tough task: Steven Gerrard is the England captain as they head for Brazil looking to end 48 years of hurt

Bobby Moore lifted the World Cup that year - still England's only major honour - on home soil and the team head for Brazil this summer desperate for any kind of boost to their chances.

The unlikeliest may have arrived in Copenhagen on Saturday night, if you believe in that sort of thing, as Wurst and her hit Rise Like A Phoenix topped the Euro pops.

The win for drag queen Conchita, the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, was good for Champions League finalists Real Madrid, 
as an Austrian Eurovision triumph preceded their European Cup win in 
1966.

Their city rivals Atletico, in pole position in La Liga, were
 Spanish champions that year.
