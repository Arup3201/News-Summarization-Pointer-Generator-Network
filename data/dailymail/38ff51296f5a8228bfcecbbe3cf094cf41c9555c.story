The thief shown in surveillance footage stealing a disabled boy’s wagon returned to apologize.

At least one of the two young women filmed stealing a six-year-old disabled boy’s wagon early Tuesday morning from the front yard of his Belmar, NJ., home felt guilty. One of the thieves returned Friday morning to apologize for the heartless theft.

Not only did she apologize, but she also bought a new wagon, according to Belmar Patch.

Shown on numerous television stations in the area after the footage was uploaded to YouTube by distraught father Jim Bean, the theft shocked the small beach resort town one hour south of New York City.

The media blitz must have struck a chord, because one of the women returned Friday morning with a brand new, still-in-the-box wagon and a written letter of apology to young Alex Bean.

‘She apologized profusely for the theft,’ mother Tracy Bean told Patch. ‘She said she was sorry… she wasn’t thinking.’

The wagon burglar didn’t know where the stolen wagon was, lost to a night of recklessness, but did replace it, Tracy Bean added.

‘I’m moved to tears,’ said the mother, ‘All is right.’

Explaining that the remorseful robber could not have been more apologetic, the happy mother declined to identify the woman.

‘She was very sincere,’ Tracy Bean told Patch. ‘She said they just didn’t think about it at the time.’

The family was featured in several new reports earlier in the week pleading for their son’s wagon to be returned, saying it was his favourite toy and that he was distraught over its disappearance.

‘I think he wants his wagon back, it's a little kid toy, come on,’ Jim Bean told WABC earlier in the week.

Alex Bean suffers from cerebellar hypoplasia, a rare neurological condition that stops him from being able to walk or speak

‘My son has a very rare neurological condition where he was born with parts of his brain missing,’ Tracy Bean told WINS.

The family took their son around the picturesque town in the wagon, instead of a wheelchair, so he felt more normal.

‘You look at my son, he's handicapped, he's in a wheelchair’ the angry father told WABC. ‘When he's in the wagon, he's a little more normal, you know? He's looking around, he's not strapped in, sitting up tight.’

Relieved: Father Jim Bean (L), Alex Bean (C) and mother Tracy Bean (R) are satisfied with the girl's apology and new wagon, they will not press charges

The wagon bought to replace it was exactly the same.    

‘That wagon was great because it supported his back and he had plenty of room,’ Tracy Bean told WINS. ‘The one [the thief] brought us is the same — it had the bucket seats, it has the seatbelt and he has plenty of room. That’s all my son needed.’

The family has said that all is forgiven and that they will not press charges. 

'I think the two women have been through enough after the video went viral, so we didn’t want to press charges,' Tracy Bean told the Asbury Park Press.

More importantly, a young boy got his favorite toy back.

'As long as my son is satisfied and happy, then I have no problem at all,' Jim Bean told the paper.
