Sligo Rovers recorded an historic 2-1 win over Norwegian giants Rosenborg in Trondheim on Thursday.

Alan Keane handed Rovers a well-deserved lead on 54 minutes before Danny North’s goal shocked the hosts as he tapped home for Sligo’s second.

Per Joar Hansen’s side pulled back a fortuitous consolation 10 minutes from time courtesy of a David Cawley own goal. But the Bit O’Red held firm to record a magnificent victory, only their third ever in European competition.

Sligo enjoyed a lively start and were responsible for the game’s first chance with less than a minute played. North’s quick thinking resulted in his pass finding Cawley, but the midfielder was denied by a Tore Reginiussen block inside the area.

Rosenborg’s Alexander Soderlund shot wide on 11 minutes after he was played through by Mikael Dorsin. Hearts were in Sligo mouths on the quarter of an hour mark. Ross Gaynor conceded possession 30 yards out, but Pal Andre Helland failed to hit the target.

Sligo’s John Russell then sent his low drive wide of Alexander Hansen’s left hand post on 25 following a speedy counter attack down their right. Rosenborg fired a warning shot before half time as Mikkelsen blasted narrowly over shortly before the break.

The industrious Helland could only bend his left footed shot wide of the Sligo goal five minutes into the second period.

Sligo took the lead soon after when Keane’s initial shot was blocked by Hansen but he made no mistake with the rebound which flew in with the help of a deflection.

Rogers pulled off another superb save on the hour mark as he diverted Helland’s downward header away for a corner. Evan McMillan cleared Morten Gamst Pedersen’s dipping header off the line on 64 as the Norwegians kept fighting.

Incredibly, Sligo doubled their lead on 70 minutes. Cawley’s searching ball to the back post was tapped in by the lurking North at the back post.

Soon after Rogers had to be alert to Helland’s deflected effort as he got his body behind the shot after it took a touch off Gaynor. North went close with a speculative effort from the angle, a few minutes later.

The home side grabbed a reply on 80 minutes. Pedersen’s corner was punched away by Rogers, but the ball hit the back of the unfortunate Cawley before it  spilled behind Rogers and into the net. Sligo almost restored their two goal advantage on 87 minutes.

Substitute Ruiari Keating robbed Mikkelsen before seeing his shot blocked away by Hansen. The rebound fell to Paul O’Conor whose effort was blocked off the line.
