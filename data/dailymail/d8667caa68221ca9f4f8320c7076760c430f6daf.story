Tragedy: This is where Lee Tien fell to her death

This photograph shows the last image of a teenage Chinese girl who killed herself rather than face life without her own mobile phone.

The parents of 13-year-old Lee Tien had been unhappy about the amount of time she spent on her mobile phone, which culminated on the day she died in a furious row with her parents.

The family refused to comment on the matter, but neighbours told local TV they had heard the pair arguing about the fact that she was always on the phone, and that the teenager was unhappy when her phone was taken off her to teach her to be more disciplined.

Neighbour Chan Juan Lai, 55, said: 'She was such a sweet girl, and very obedient. Who would not have thought she would take her own life over something so unimportant.'

But devastated at the loss of the device, she had instead thrown herself from the front room window of the 11th floor flat in the city of Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, in southwest China.

Resident Chen Jutian, 34, spotted the girl lying face up on the ground and immediately reported the incident to the police. Medics who attended confirmed that the teenager was dead.

He said: 'I saw that she wasn't moving and feared the worst, which was confirmed when the medics arrived.'
