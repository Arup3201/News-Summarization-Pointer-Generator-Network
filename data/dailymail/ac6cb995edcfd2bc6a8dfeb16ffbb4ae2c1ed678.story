High-ranking prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC has been accused of perverting the course of justice and will be the focus of a NSW corruption inquiry.

The deputy senior crown prosecutor, along with her son Stephen Wyllie, are being investigated after allegedly advising Wylie's girlfriend, Sophia Tilley, to pretend to have chest pains to avoid having a blood alcohol test following a car crash on May 31 this year.

Ms Cunneen has stood aside from her duties until ICAC's investigations have been completed by the corruption watchdog.

Ms Tilley allegedly took the advice that was offered to her at the time of the incident.

Attorney-General Brad Hazzard said in a statement that it was 'important to recognise that any individual appearing before ICAC has the presumption of innocence.'

'The Director of Public Prosecutions has advised me that in discussions with Ms Cunneen SC she has agreed that it is appropriate for her to stand aside and to have no active involvement in any current prosecution or future prosecution until the resolution of the ICAC hearing, whereupon the situation will be reviewed,' the statement said.

'As this matter involves a senior public official involved in the administration of justice in New South Wales, the Commission considered it appropriate for a person from outside New South Wales to preside at the inquiry,' the commission said in a statement, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The three-day inquiry begins on November 10.

Due to Ms Cunneen's standing, Queensland barrister Alan MacSporran QC is being brought in from outside NSW to preside over the inquiry. 

Ms Cunneen was appointed to preside over the special commission of inquiry into claims of interference in police investigations of alleged paedophile priests in the NSW Hunter region.
