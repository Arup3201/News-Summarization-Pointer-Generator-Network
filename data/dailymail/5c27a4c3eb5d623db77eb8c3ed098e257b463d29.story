Ian Bell would like to continue working with Graham Gooch — who was sacked as England batting coach earlier this year — after a one-to-one session before last week’s third Test proved an instant hit.

The England No 4 made a sparkling 167 in Southampton, his first Test hundred for 20 innings, to set up a crushing win over India — and credited his revival to a two-hour net with Gooch at Edgbaston.

Bell had been one of the senior players failing to do justice to their talents this summer, averaging just 25 in four games against Sri Lanka and the Indians. But, two days after the nadir of England’s 95-run defeat in the second Test at Lord’s, he invited Gooch up to Birmingham for a session on Warwickshire’s colts ground.

‘We have a really good set-up with England, but sometimes it’s nice to have another set of eyes,’ Bell told Sportsmail.

‘I used to have Neil Abberley here at Warwickshire, someone you could chat through a few things with. Because they’re not so attached to the game, there’s less emotion involved, and it’s nice to do that with Goochy — a net session with someone who can help me reconnect in a different way.’

Gooch, whose tally of 20 Test hundreds was surpassed by Bell at the Ageas Bowl, was hurt when Alastair Cook told him at the end of April that his services were no longer required by England. But Bell’s decision to seek help outside the bubble reflects the high esteem in which Gooch continues to be held.

‘He does one-on-one net sessions really well,’ said Bell. ‘He never goes through the motions. He puts you under the pump, which is where you are in a Test match. He never gets over-complicated or technical. It’s about making sure you’re in the right frame of mind.

‘As Goochy always says, you should always be looking to score runs, not just to survive. It’s nice to refresh that from time to time. Generally we’re always exchanging text messages.

‘And if he’s available I try to make the most of him for a couple of hours. If I get the chance I’d like to keep doing that.’

Ian Bell moved into England’s top ten Test run scorers against India last week. His 7091 took him past Andrew Strauss. 

Gooch was not Bell’s only net buddy in the lead-up to the Southampton Test. After seeking permission from Cook and coach Peter Moores, Bell took it upon himself to offer his former Warwickshire team-mate Moeen Ali help with his off-breaks.

The upshot? Second-innings figures of six for 67, the best by an England spinner against India since Ray Illingworth at Lord’s in 1967.

Bell said: ‘Having watched him bowl in the first Test, and having faced him in the nets, it felt like he was bowling in the Test as he was in the nets.

‘The important thing for me was trying to get him clear on what his role was at different times in the game.

‘Swanny was brilliant at having two game plans: hold up an end for the seamers when conditions aren’t in your favour, then bowl aggressively when they are. Moeen is naturally aggressive: he gets spin on the ball and good shape.

‘He’s got his pace up a little bit to 55mph, from 51 when he started. But on the Hawk-Eye data he’s also getting more drop and drift.

‘The important thing for me is not pace but energy. When Swanny bowled, his arm speed was full of energy, so the ball drops. With dismissals like when Moeen nicked off Pujara and Kohli — world-class players of spin — the ball deceived them on length. He wants to learn and he’s not far away.’

England’s unofficial vice-captain, Bell was named in some quarters as a possible leader until Cook ended his own drought last week with scores of 95 and 70 not out and his side’s first win in 11 Tests. But he says it was not a scenario he gave any credence to.

‘I heard it muttered around, but I didn’t pay it much attention because obviously I believe Cooky’s the right man. He’s won Test series in India, he’s won an Ashes series and he’s 29. I think he’s the right bloke to captain England.’

If the loyalty is to be expected, then Bell’s own lack of runs made his potential promotion just as unlikely. But his 167 — after he was lucky to escape an lbw shout from Pankaj Singh before he had scored — symbolised the about-turn in Southampton which Bell describes as ‘a perfect five days’.

And he said the possible ban hanging over Jimmy Anderson during the third Test following his altercation in the Trent Bridge pavilion with Ravindra Jadeja did England no harm.

‘Maybe it has brought us tighter together,’ he said. ‘No one’s really discussed it too much. Jimmy wanted it that way, to focus on the cricket. But hopefully it will keep us tight as a unit. Jimmy was at the top of his game — he must prefer those headlines.’

When the fourth Test starts in Manchester on Thursday, England will be hoping for more of the same.
