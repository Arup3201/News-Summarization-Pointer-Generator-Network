England saw their Grand Slam ambitions go up in smoke for another season in Dublin two weeks ago, but Stuart Lancaster's side are still very much in the hunt for the Championship.

Lancaster's side will look to bounce back against Scotland on Saturday evening following their disappointing 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium. 

Courtney Lawes's return to the engine room is most welcome following England's problems at lineout time against Joe Schmidt's side last time out.

Saracens No 8 Vunipola and his fellow back rowers will be looking to bounce back against the Scots 

Mike Brown returns at full-back following his recovery from concussion and replaces the unlucky Alex Goode who was one of England's better players during the Dublin defeat. 

Lancaster's men will be looking to unleash two weeks of pent-up frustration on Scotland following their round three loss. 

Robshaw led his charges through their team-run at Twickenham on Friday, but the squad engaged in much more hostile session at their team base at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday.  

'I had to calm it down, blow the whistle at the end and make sure we didn't play the game too early,' Lancaster said on Wednesday.   

Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetress will once again provide cover from the bench 

Backs coach Andy Farrell has demanded England react to their setback in the Irish capital by keeping their title hopes alive against the Scots.

'What happened against Ireland is a massive factor for this game,' England's backs coach said.

'If you put that alongside the fact we are still in with a shout of winning the competition, then those two things together are a pretty powerful thing leading up to this game. Hopefully we'll put in a performance that matters.

'You learn a lot from a loss. Lads who haven't been in that type of position before will have learnt a lot.

'Did we let ourselves down against Ireland? We didn't play our best, but Ireland like most good sides have a way of making an impact on the game and they did that very successfully.

'There is a determination to put a performance in.'

Farrell is hoping his side will improve on their two key shortcomings against Ireland namely their failure to assert their authority at the breakdown and a lack of discipline.  

'We're confident about the breakdown and our discipline for this week. They have been big areas that we have worked on,' Farrell added. 

'We've worked on all aspects of the game this week, making sure we're ready for all aspects that could happen.'
