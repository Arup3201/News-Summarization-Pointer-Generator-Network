A vast collection of over 1,000 letters, postcards and manuscripts written by some of history's most iconic women from the 14th century onwards are going under the hammer. 

The auction, Women: Letters and Signed Manuscripts, will see letters collated by manuscript expert Thierry Bodin up for auction in Paris where they are expected to fetch thousands.

One of the most interesting lots is a letter from Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon begging the Pope to block their divorce. The historical artefact is expected to fetch up to £35,000 at auction.

Historical artefact: A letter from Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon, left, begging the Pope to block their divorce is expected to fetch up to £35,000 at auction

In the note dated October 3, 1529, the Spanish-born Queen asks a cardinal from her home country to seek the pontiff’s help in halting the king’s bid to annul their marriage because she had failed to produce a son.

Within the letter, she writes: 'I am completely innocent. I can assure you with certainty that here [in England] there is no decision that can be made that will not bring a great evil in the future.'

Pope Clement VII’s eventual refusal to grant the divorce led to a schism with the Roman Catholic Church, with Henry appointing himself head of the Church of England.

The Ader Nordmann auction house in Paris expects the letter to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000, making it one of the most lucrative items. 

The letter is among more than 1,500 from royalty and celebrities to go under the hammer in Paris next week.

Vintage: The auction also includes a letter written by Brigitte Bardot in 1967, within which she asks a record company not to release her steamy duet Je t'aime moi non plus with Serge Gainsbourg

Explanation: It was re-recorded after Bardot's husband Gunter Sachs objected. Jane Birkin, who later became Gainsbourg's wife, then featured on the song

In one written by Brigitte Bardot in 1967, she asks a record company not to release her steamy duet ‘Je t’aime moi non plus’ with Serge Gainsbourg after husband Gunter Sachs objected.

It was re-recorded with Jane Birkin  who later became Gainsbourg's wife. The lot is expected to fetch around £2,300.

The auction, which also includes missives from Coco Chanel and author Victor Hugo's mistress Juliette Drouet, will take place in Paris on November 18 and 19.

Speaking to The Guardian about the auction, which has been dubbed the first of its kind, Bodin said: 'It’s really the first time so important a collection in terms of both quantity and content and time period covered, has been seen.

'It covers women from all domains, historical figures, writers, actors, painters, scientists.'

Friendly chatter: The Paris auction will also include a letter exchanged between Katharine Hepburn, left, and Coco Chanel. The postcard was sent to the fashion designer after Hepburn played her in a Broadway show

Legendary women: Amongst the 1,500 documents is manuscripts from Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, pictured, and Mary Queen of Scots

Amongst these women is a letter exchanged between Katharine Hepburn and Coco Chanel. Penned in French, the postcard was sent to the fashion designer after Hepburn played her in a Broadway show.

There's also lots of manuscripts from royals, such as Henry VIII’s sister Mary Tudor, Mary Queen of Scots, and a note from Queen Elizabeth II to her hatmaker and stylist.

Queen Elizabeth writes: 'I am really delighted with your present. And I can truthfully say it is just what I need, for my one white bag is grey now, and my maid was in despair!'. 

A letter from Catherine II of Russia in 1792 to her former lover Stanislas Auguste Poniatowski, says: 'You read my letters with very little attention. I've told you and repeated that I risk being assaulted from all sides if you put a foot back in Russia.'

Style notes: A letter from Queen Elizabeth in 1950 to her hatmaker and stylist says: 'I am really delighted with your present. And I can truthfully say it is just what I need, for my one white bag is grey now, and my maid was in despair!'

Another highlight of the collection includes a note from Princess Grace of Monaco, estimated to fetch  around £460, apologising to a teacher for her daughter Stephanie not doing her homework.

She writes: 'Please excuse Stephanie for not having done her French lesson. She left her book at school, Wednesday. Grace de Monaco.'

Sylvie Robaglia, spokeswoman for the auctioneers, Ader-Nordmann, also told the paper: 'The letters reveal how strong these women are. 

'The letter from Catherine of Aragon is the centrepiece of the collection. In it we see her defending the throne for her children; she is showing herself to be a mother before all else, before being the Queen.'

Edith Piaf wrote to husband Jacques Pills in 1956 (while she was in rehab for alcohol and morphine addiction): “Lovely man, have confidence in me as you have always had and you will see it’s the good side in me that will win, by the end of the detoxification! It’s not even two months … you will see that things can start again! I am always your good little wife.'

Virginia Woolf penned this to André Maurois in 1929: 'I have been unwell otherwise I would have already thanked you for the very kind preface you wrote for the French translation of Mrs Dalloway. It’s a great privilege for me to come across so much intelligence and sympathy.'

Catherine of Aragon wrote  to Francisco de Quiñones, the cardinal of Santa Cruz: 'Without cause, except, as I sincerely believe, at the instigation of an enemy completely without scruples [Thomas Cromwell] who has abused the king, my lord; the case, if examined without passion, will clearly show, I hope, that truth and justice are on my side'

Juliette Drouet to Victor Hugo: 'When I left you my angel, you seemed sad and unhappy - My Victor, will I be attached to your life like a venomous scorpion that withers and exhausts it?'
