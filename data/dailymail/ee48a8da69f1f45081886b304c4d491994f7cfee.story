While there was plenty to admire from our favourite male celebrities in 2014, even our most esteemed hunks managed to let us down.

From scalp landing strips and a gratuitous display of pectoral cleavage to slinging on a bedspread and calling it a scarf, A-list men provided much to look at - if not to applaud.

Now a national survey reveals the very worst crimes against fashion committed by some of the biggest names in music, acting, and reality TV. 

Robert Pattinson's bizarre 'rat tail' hair do

This bizarre haircut was the clear winner of The Biggest Fashion Fail of 2014.

The 28-year-old actor gave the world the first glimpse of his very unusual new 'do as he and girlfriend FKA Twigs headed back to their hotel in New York in November.

Instead of the tousled vampire locks he is known for, Robert instead sported a monkish tonsure.

Heartthrob Rob Pattinson showed off 2014's most bizarre haircut: a monk's tonsure with a lone landing strip

Rob, here with co-star Kristen Stewart in Twilight, is better known for his tousled  floppy locks

But there at the base of his skull was a rectangular patch of close-cropped hair. 

Was it punk? Was it fashion-forward? No one knows, but perhaps the edgy style is influenced by his out-there new girlfriend. 

FKA Twigs - whose real name Tahliah Barnett - is known for her envelope-pushing look both on and off stage.

However it is doubtful that Rob's legions of loyal fans, who came to love him as floppy haired Edward in the Twilight saga, are as happy at his makeover.

Oliver Tezcan, founder and CEO of  menswear fashion website TheIdleman.com, which conducted the survey,  said: 'When Robert Pattinson first showed off the "landing strip" haircut many people took to Twitter to speculate if he'd done it because he had lost a bet.

'Others thought it looked like an exclamation mark without the dot, or a goatee on the wrong side of this face – but like just our survey the unanimous verdict was that this was a huge fashion fail.'

Kanye West's Fashion Week moob display

While you have to give the rapper and designer credit for his courage and adventurous fashion sense, he often gets it wrong.

While there were many options for his ultimate style fail of 2014, the one voted for by Brits was his fine display of 'man boobs' or 'moobs' during Paris Fashion Week. 

Kanye's Lavin show look contained many aspects including moobs, head stripes and knee-less jeans 

The rapper appeared with wife Kim Kardashian at the front row of the Lanvin show in September.

She wore a tuxedo jacket with nothing on underneath so Kanye made sure they matched by unbuttoning his navy shirt to the navel.

The result? It was difficult to decide who had better cleavage

Justin Bieber's  leopard-print trousers and studded hat

The 18-year-old was seen sporting a pair of bright purple leopard-print trousers, a black jumper and a bright yellow hat complete with metal studs. 

The teen crooner was snapped wearing this inexplicable outfit as he left the swanky Langham Hotel in London after a night of partying which saw him visit several nightclubs across the Capital before being joined by two young ladies at his hotel at 4.30am.

After such escapades, it is perhaps plausible that Beiber rolled out of bed and headed to his car still in his nightwear and donned the unusual hat as a means to conceal his bed hair. 

Over the course of 2014 Justin has done his best to shed his clean-cut image with drugs, arrests and a monkey-related scandal all ensuring the Baby singer didn't stay out of the spotlight for long.

Alongside this transformation has come a change in his fashion, with Justin opting for a much more urban feel to his wardrobe.

However this look may be taking his new found edginess just a tad too far. 

Bobby Norris's one-legged 'Schlong Thong' 

When TOWIE star Bobby Norris walked out into the Marbella June sunshine wearing his barely-there man pants, the whole world gaped in awe. 

How does it stay up? Is this legal in public? What would Borat say?

Pictures of the asymmetric 'swimsuit' went viral, with celebrities such as Paris Hilton and David Walliams even tweeting about the daring summer look.

There is almost nothing good to say about Bobby's decision to wear a red sling in lieu of swimming trunks, an option that provided the least possible amount of cloth cover without making him liable for prosecution for exposing himself in public.

Explaining his one legged budgie-smuggler Bobby said that it avoided 'unsightly white bits' while tanning. He even appeared on ITV's This Morning to try and sell his very own range of the tiny swimwear.  

Oliver Tezcan said clearly Bobby was trying to shock with his particularly revealing choice of swimwear.

Proudlock's all-tartan suit 

Known for his long hair and lothario ways on E4's Made In Chelsea, Oliver Proudlock, who goes mainly by his surname, usually wears a casual combination of tight trousers and T-shirt.

Proudlock was joined by his stylish co-star Rosie Fortescue at a John Rocha fashion show in February

However clearly feeling he had to smarten up for the  John Rocha autumn/winter 2014 catwalk show in February, Proudlock opted for head-to-toe tartan. 

He may have thought he looked jazzy, but the overall appearance was closer to picnic blanket than high fashion.

The T-shirt designer accessorised the Ralph Lauren Polo tailor-made tartan suit with a plain white shirt and gold medallion on a chain.

Mark Wright's pink velour tracksuit

Another popular fashion fail was Essex boy Mark Wright's fuchsia all-in-one outfit.

It was a rare style mistake from Strictly Come Dancing finalist and reality TV star Mark as the usually dapper 27-year-old wore a shocking pink velour tracksuit for a trip to Newcastle in May. 

To make matters worse he teamed the sportswear with a pair of bright white trainers, allowing for a glimpse of ankle between the elasticated trousers and shoes.

Engaged to the stylish Michelle Keegan, Mark generally fares well in the style stakes, which makes this faux pas all the more upsetting. 

Usher and Lenny Kravitz's outlandish accessories 

How did two of the most fashionable and desired men in the music business manage to get it so wrong.

Wearing perfectly normal outfits, both R&B star Usher and rock star Lenny Kravitz suceeded in landing themselves on the worst fashion fail list through their accessories alone.

Despite being indoors - and in Los Angeles - Usher plonked a giant fur raccoon hat on his head for the BET awards show.

As well as being totally out of place when not worn by a mountaineer up a snowy peak, the presence of a furry tail hanging down the singer's neck was nothing short of creepy.

Similarly, Lenny managed to ruin his normal get-up of shirt, jumper, jacket and jeans with a massive scarf.

More blanket than winter warmer, the knitted monstrosity looked in danger of suffocating the rocker as he walked.  

Long enough to comfortably cover a sofa, the brown scarf hung down nearly to the singer's waist and even Lenny's legendary swag couldn't make it look good.

Pharrell Williams' cropped tux 

Musician Pharrell Williams made it on to the list with his black tie shorts look which he wore to the Oscars.

A true gentleman's classic, the tuxedo is not to be messed with, and while the Happy singer can pull off many wacky looks (most famously of course his Mountie hat), the cropped tux trousers he wore to the Oscars led many to question if there had been an accident at the dry-cleaners.

Standing at a modest 5ft 7in, the knee-length leg-wear did nothing to lengthen the star, who looked positively diminutive next to his statuesque wife Helen Lasichanh.

Pharrell Williams may have written Happy, the song of 2014, but his cropped tuxedo  failed to win fans
