A TV news anchor in Colorado is so fed up with people taking photos of their snow-covered patio furniture to show how much snow has accumulated whenever there's a storm that he devoted two whole minutes of airtime to explain to viewers that they can do better.

'C'mon, Colorado. We can do better than this. We love winter. We own winter. Let's take the pictures to prove it,' 9NEWS anchor Kyle Clark said in his humorous rant.

Clark - who is originally from Upstate New York - feels that, given Colorado's natural beauty, residents should start taking photos of things slightly more impressive than the patio furniture they bought at Costco.

Fed up: Colorado anchor Kyle Clark thinks the state's residents can do better when it comes to photographically documenting snow storms

Enough: 'Yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too'

'We live in one of the most beautiful spots on earth but we point our cameras towards the back porch...yes, everyone is impressed you have a four-piece set - we saw it at Costco, too. Chair covers? Somebody got a raise. A grill? Nice. Three grills? Easy there, Bobby Flay,' he jokes.

Clark explains that there are simple things people can do to make their winter patio shots a little more interesting.

According to Clark, 'if you like it then you should have put a thing on it.'

Clark suggests including a 'disgruntled dog' in your winter, patio shots. Or 'your husband drinking a beer' - anything to liven up the monotony of patio shots that are constantly coming into his newsroom.

Boring: With all the natural beauty in Colorado, Clark wants people to photograph things other than chairs covered in snow

People take shots of their patios, Clark explains, because it's easy - you just 'point the camera out the window and click.'

But - as Clark points out - Colorado residents don't 'take the easy way out.'

'We blasted a road through the Rockies. We put a cliff in a Mexican restaurant,' Clark says. 'Our welcome sign is a demon horse with crazy laser eyes. We don't do easy around here.'

Clark ended his rant by dropping his lapel mic, as if to say 'peace, I'm outta here.'

Clark later took to Twitter to share some reactions to his editorial - and not everyone found it as amusing as he did.

'So tonight Kyle Clark was whining about people sending in pictures about snow on their decks. So what?' one viewer wrote in an email to the station. 'Seems like it's your station that chooses to show these pictures. I am having a tough time understanding why Mr. Clark is still employed.'

Clark posted a screenshot of the email on his Twitter feed, along with a tweet saying 'the emails from the people seriously offended by the snow photo editorial are the absolute best.'
