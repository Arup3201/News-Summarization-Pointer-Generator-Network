A group of Manchester United supporters have raised £840 to fund an aeroplane to fly over Old Trafford with an anti-David Moyes message.

The supporters have put the money together to hire the plane with the order: ‘Wrong One – Moyes Out’ to go overhead during Saturday's Barclays Premier League home match against Aston Villa.

It is a direct challenge to the Stretford End Flags group, who say they will not take down the 'Chosen One' banner inside Old Trafford.

Stretford End Flags spokesman Andrew Kilduff on why they're keeping the Moyes 'Chosen One' banner - for now

The Republik of Mancunia website, who first reported the plans, 
said: 'The message is a response to the Stretford End Flags banner which
 reads "The Chosen One".

Following United’s 3-0 defeat against City 
yesterday, stewards were sent to protect the banner at full time, after 
there were concerns that fans would want to remove it.'

'As
 yet, there have been no public protests within the ground, home or 
away, but it is expected that will change at the weekend when United 
face Villa.'

Andrew 
Kilduff of Stretford End Flags told Sportsmail that the group had 
thought about taking the banner down but ultimately decided to keep it 
up.

He explained: 'It’s
 rare that we commission banners for a player or manager who has just 
arrived. Certainly it’s almost unheard of that we would do one for 
someone who hadn’t won or achieved anything with us. But we thought the 
David Moyes situation was different. 

'When
 he arrived, we had been urged by Sir Alex Ferguson to support him and 
this was just one of the ways we felt we could do that. Now we are under
 some pressure to take it down.

'The words "The Chosen One" came from
 a rank-and-file United fan and we took it and ran with it. It was 
appropriate that it was first hung for the visit of Jose Mourinho and 
Chelsea at the first home game of the season. We knew the "Special One" 
had wanted the United job and this was our way of telling him we had 
chosen someone else.'

'The 
feedback was largely good. A few people moaned that Moyes shouldn’t get a
 banner until he had won something but on the whole the banner proved 
very popular, both as a concept and in terms of the wording.

'All
 in all it probably cost about £500 to make and hang and all that cash 
came from supporters. Some may donate a pound, someone else may donate 
£50. It’s the way it always is.

'Over
 the course of the season there have been some moans and groans about 
results but the talk about removing the banner only really gathered pace
 on the Sunday and Monday ahead of the Olympiacos home game. People 
started to get in touch on Twitter and other social media asking us to 
take it down.

'As we speak, there are still calls 
for us to remove it. There are polls saying that more than 90 per cent 
of fans want it down. But 90 per cent of how many? Is that truly 
representative of the average United fan? I’m not sure it is.

'What
 we don’t want to do is anything knee-jerk. So the banner will stay for 
now. It will stay for the Villa game on Saturday and it will stay for 
Bayern Munich. As I said before, the focus should be on the team ahead 
of the Bayern game in particular.

'There has been nothing particularly visible or verbal against Moyes during games at Old Trafford. No ‘Moyes Out’ flags or anything. So we don’t think it’s our place to initiate some kind of campaign for his sacking by taking his banner down.'

Planes are usually used by fans to taunt opponents, such as when Millwall supporters flew a message over the DW Stadium mocking relegated West Ham and thanking their manager Avram Grant.

They are even sometimes used by players - in the 1980s Blackburn striker Simon Garner hired one to mock relegated rivals Burnley.
