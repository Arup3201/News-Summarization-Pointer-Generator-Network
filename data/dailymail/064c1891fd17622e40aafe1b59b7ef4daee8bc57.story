It may not have all the bells and whistles, or the expense, of Apple’s fingerprint scanner, but Google does offer an alternative way to unlock an Android phone - and it involves using your face.

The Face Unlock feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of Android 4.0, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich, but despite this, it is still a relatively unknown tool.

It can recognise a person’s face and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph.

Google launched its facial recognition feature called Face Unlock when it released Android 4.0 in 2011 - but it could be bypassed by holding a photo up to the screen. During the update to Android 4.1 in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check. The user must now blink during authentication to confirm they are alive and not a static image. However, some users were still able to bypass this using photo editing tricks

To set up Face Unlock, people with Android phones running Ice Cream Sandwich or higher can go to Settings, Security, click on Screen Lock and select Face Unlock.

The set-up wizard will then ask the user to take a photo of their face, using the device’s front-facing camera. It will also advise if the lighting or positioning isn’t clear enough.

Once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face, the Android system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph.

As a backup, users need to additionally set up a screen lock pattern or PIN, in case the camera breaks or fails to recognise their face. This can happen in poor lighting, for example.

When Google launched Face Unlock it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet's camera.

In the update to Android Jelly Bean in July 2012, Google added a 'liveness' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices.

This meant a user would have to blink while using Face Unlock to prove they were alive.

A number of Nexus 5 users reported problems with the Face Unlock feature when the phone  launched earlier this year, but Google has said that these bugs should be fixed with the introduction of Android 4.4 KitKat.

In June, details emerged of a Google patent, pictured, that would let users unlock their phones by pulling silly faces, such as frowning, poking out their tongue or wriggling their nose. The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity

The expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user's identity.

The patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible.

It is likely this feature may appear in future versions of the Android operating system, although a precise release date hasn’t been announced.
