Paul McGinley has made no secret of the fact that Ryder Cups are won with great teamwork, so it should come as no surprise to see him and Justin Rose expertly riding a tandem bicycle together.

The duo were taking part in a special race against Ian Poulter and Chinese golfer Wu Ashun ahead of this week's BMW Masters in Shanghai.

Just as most of McGinley's pairings at Gleneagles worked perfectly in tandem, his ride with Rose looked to be a great success... even if the Englishman admitted afterwards: 'I was hanging on for dear life.'

Perhaps the US Ryder Cup taskforce, set up to address their consistent failures in the biennial showpiece against Europe, should take a look at the pictures. Perhaps Phil Mickelon should be encouraged to ride in tandem with the next American captain. Well, good luck with that.

The BMW Masters is the first event of the European Tour's season-ending Final Series, which sees the climax of The Race to Dubai.

But after Rory McIlroy's spectacular summer, Rose admits he has little chance of catching the Open and US PGA champion to be crowned Europe's No 1 this year. Instead, the former US Open winner has set himself a new target during the next month: reaching No 2 in the world rankings.

Rose is currently ranked sixth in the world but has been as high as third following his triumph at Merion last year. He now wants to go one better.

'I’m not sure I can catch Rory in The Race to Dubai,' said Rose, who is eighth in the money list but a long way behind the runaway leader. 'But the bonus pool runs deep down to 15th and I want to strengthen my world ranking as much as possible.

'If I can play well and maybe win a couple of tournaments between now and the end of the season, I could probably get up to second in the world, which would be a personal best. So there’s always something to play for.'

Poulter arrived at Lake Malaren Golf Club hoping for a happy ending to a difficult season. The Englishman's latest troubling episode was being branded a 'Lil Girl' by PGA of America president Ted Bishop, who was subsequently sacked for his comments.

Poulter currently sits outside the top 60 who earn a place in the season-ending Dubai showpiece. But the Englishman was in a positive frame of mind after arriving in the country where he sealed his biggest career win to date, the WGC-HSBC Champions in 2012.

A fun warm-up round of match play against Rose on the course they co-designed at Mission Hills appears to have helped Poulter's mood too.

'It’s always nice to come back to Asia and I’ve got a decent record here,' said Poulter. 'I've played well on this golf course in the past, so I’m looking forward to getting going.

'I’ve been in China for five days, and opening the golf course with Justin was great fun. We had a little match play competition yesterday and he managed to beat me 3 and 2, so it would be nice if I can go one up on him this week.'
