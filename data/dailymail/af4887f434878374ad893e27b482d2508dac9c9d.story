It seems that everybody has regrets about the way they look, even supermodels. 

Elle Macpherson has revealed that she wishes she had taken better care of her skin when she was younger and now wears Factor 50 sun cream every day to try and reverse the damage she caused in her early years.

Speaking to Into The Gloss, the model said: 'My greatest regret from when I was younger was that I didn’t protect my skin from the sun—even though I think I look better with a tan.

She continued: 'I have plenty of freckles all over my body and I haven’t done anything about it. There’s no point in doing lasers because I’m in the sun all the time anyway, but I think sunblock is really important now. Always 50+ SPF.' 

50-year-old Elle, who started her career as a model in the 80s, also told the site that to kick start her career, she even funded her own business.

She revealed that with cash in the bank she created her own calender and found a photographer and distributor off her own back. 

She is now a shrewd businesswoman and has designed her own lines of beauty products and a lingerie line called Elle Macpherson intimates. 

Elle always looks stunning on the red carpet but she admits that she doesn't like to wear a lot of make-up

In the Nineties, Elle was nicknamed 'The body' because of her incredible figure 

In the interview, Elle also revealed that despite being one of the most glamorous women in the world she's not a fan of piling make-up onto her face.

In fact, she has even banned her step-daughters from wearing it. 

She said: 'I have two stepdaughters, 14 and 16, and I usually tell them to take their makeup off. 

'They come downstairs and I tell them, 'Go back up.' They look so much prettier without it. I was never into makeup growing up, and I'm still not into makeup.' 

Elle, who was given the nickname 'The Body' thanks to her amazing figure, told Into The Gloss that when it comes to doing her own face she shies away from a red lip and prefers to do dark eye make-up and a nude lip. 

She also reveals that she likes to match her nail varnish and will always go for very dark or very light shades for both her toes and her nails. 

While Elle shies away from the make-up counter in pharmacies, one thing she does love to indulge in is holistic remedies. 

She said: 'I have a holistic approach to my body - all Australians do. 

'We more readily accept alternative medicine, acupuncture, homeopathy, and clean ingredients. 

'It’s also about making sure I put time aside for meditation, time to laugh a lot and to read inspiring material.'
