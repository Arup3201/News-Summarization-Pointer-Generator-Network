Ed Miliband was last night forced to publicly deny that Labour’s chances of winning the general election would be boosted if he was replaced by Alan Johnson.

The Labour leader, who is facing a revolt over his ‘complacent’ strategy for winning power, dismissed suggestions that health spokesman Andy Burnham was also plotting to succeed him.

Both Mr Johnson, 64, and Mr Burnham, who ran in the last Labour leadership campaign, have been touted as potential replacements.

There were claims last night that Mr Johnson would take the top job if it was offered in a ‘coronation’ rather than a contested election.

The charismatic former home secretary insisted his answer to those urging him to make a leadership bid was: ‘No, no, no, no, no.’

Asked if Labour’s chances of success would be improved if he went, an irritated Mr Miliband answered: ‘I don’t. I think that I’m the right person to be doing this job.

‘What I’m clear about is that we have a plan. We have a plan for the future of this country and these questions don’t arise.’

Labour nerves have been jangled by three polls suggesting the Tories have moved ahead after Mr Miliband’s disastrous party conference speech, in which he forgot to mention the budget deficit.

David Cameron, meanwhile, has opened up a staggering 42-point lead over Mr Miliband on the question of leadership.

There is growing unrest over the Labour leader’s alleged plan to secure victory by winning around 35 per cent of the vote – core Labour supporters plus disaffected Liberal Democrats. A poll set alarm bells ringing this week by suggesting a sharp fall in the number of Lib Dems switching to Labour.

The Labour leader is said to be preparing to shake up his top team within the next few weeks as he seeks to steady the ship.

Former Cabinet minister Lord Adonis, an ‘ultra’ Blairite who masterminded the academies programme, is tipped for a comeback. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said that if his party clinched victory in a by-election in the safe Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton tomorrow, ‘Ed Miliband will be gone by Christmas’.

He refused to endorse another Labour politician to replace Mr Miliband, but said: ‘Alan Johnson at least has the advantage of talking like a human being.’

Mr Miliband is also under pressure to make a strong attempt to deliver a Labour victory in another by- election in Rochester, Kent, amid signs the party plans to sit back as the Tories and Ukip slug it out.

Former defence minister Lord Moonie said his party needed to do more to reflect the concerns of ordinary voters: ‘The concerns of voters in Rochester should be ours too, if we wish to win our targets. Poverty of aspiration has never to my knowledge been a winning strategy.

‘We must inspire people. As a confirmed anti-EU campaigner, I believe for a start we should be offering a referendum on in/out. We must also address legitimate concerns of our working-class core support on migration and jobs.’

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, called for a significant reshuffle – accusing his party of becoming too metropolitan.

‘This problem is well beyond Ed Miliband,’ he said.

‘He’s got to shake up the pack, it’s fundamental – he’s got to change the attitude at the top. There’s too much Mr Nice Guy – he’s not prepared to tackle the difficult issues such as immigration.

‘People at the top of the Labour Party need to listen to concerns over immigration and over people’s feeling of being disenfranchised in England. What I want is Ed Miliband to listen to the concerns of people like me and voters I represent.

‘In order to win he needs a bigger dose of Northern realism.’ Labour’s former Scottish leader Henry McLeish said that Mr Miliband had made ‘elementary’ mistakes.

‘What is the vision? What are the values? And more importantly, [what is] the narrative? Because quite frankly, the Tories have a narrative and we don’t,’ he said.
