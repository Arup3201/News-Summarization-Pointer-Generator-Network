Innocent: Former detective Trevor Gray, pictured at Birmingham Crown Court, was cleared of rape

A former detective sergeant who was jailed for rape almost two years ago has been declared innocent after a new witness came forward.

Trevor Gray, 49, was accused of raping a 43-year-old mother who invited him back to her house after a date.

Despite protesting the sex was consensual, he was sent to prison for eight years - where he remained until a taxi driver who had picked him up contacted police.

Gray's conviction was quashed in July last year after the new evidence came to light. The Court of Appeal, ruling that missing the witness from the original case had made the verdict 'unsafe', ordered a four-day retrial.

Today a jury of nine men and three women cleared Gray unanimously of rape, attempted rape and sexual touching.

Gray slammed the handling of his case by former colleagues at Nottinghamshire Police.

He told the court: 'The
 (police) investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation.
 My life has been ruined. I've been put in prison for 13 months for 
something I didn't do.'

Birmingham Crown Court heard Gray, from Watnall, Nottinghamshire, had been out for drinks with the woman in Nottingham city centre on July 23, 2011, and they returned to her house in a taxi.

According to the woman, she asked Gray to leave and he said he was going to hail a taxi to take him home - but he returned, breaking her door security chain and raping her while her young child slept in the house.

She claimed she fell asleep and woke up with Gray naked on top of her and raping her.

Gray, pictured leaving court with his ex-wife Alison Gray, said: 'The investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation. My life has been ruined. I've been put in prison for 13 months for something I didn't do'

But Gray told the jury he had been unable to hail a cab, so tried to ring the woman for help. She did not pick up so he returned to her house.

When he saw her door was ajar, he thought something was wrong and broke the chain - then she told him he 'might as well stay' and initiated sex.

Asked if he raped the woman, he told the court: 'I did not. The sexual activities were 
consensual. She agreed to everything, she initiated everything.

'It was her suggestion to go back to her house. I was on a date, I had no expectations. She gave me a tour of the house - she was obviously very proud of the house.

'We
 went back to the lounge and we sat on the settee cuddling and kissing. 
She suddenly said "it's probably time to go". I went to the door, we 
kissed and I went.

'[Later] I rang her phone, I send her another text asking her to get me a cab, again there was no response.

'I
 rang a couple more times and got no response. At that point I felt 
there was clearly something wrong. I walked back down towards the house.

'I could see the lights were on. I could see the door was ajar.

'My
 levels of concern were getting higher and higher. I repeatedly rang the
 doorbell with no response. I shouted through the door with no response.

'Then I made a decision to enter the premises. I used my hands on the door and pushed it open snapping the chain.

'She
 was sitting up in bed. I explained to her that I had been concerned 
about her. I then asked her if she could get me a taxi.

'She said "you might as well stay now". Everything was absolutely fine.

'I
 removed my clothing, used the toilet then I got in to the bed. I was 
lying in the bed, I turned away from her and after a few minutes I felt 
her arm come across me. I turned inwards and we started to kiss.'

Gray was suspended and later dismissed from Nottinghamshire Police after 
he was jailed.

His appeal to rejoin the force is still being considered and a police spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate to comment' before it is decided.

Detective Superintendent Jackie Alexander, of the Professional Standards Directorate, said: 'We
 take any report of sexual assault and rape extremely seriously and have
 a duty to investigate such allegations, whoever they are made against.

'The
 CPS considered it appropriate for this case to be prosecuted through 
the criminal justice system and having been presented to a jury over 
four-days they have considered the evidence and made a decision to 
acquit Trevor Gray.'
