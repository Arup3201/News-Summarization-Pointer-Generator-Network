Theresa May has publicly rebuked her Cabinet colleague Vince Cable for claiming that last week’s figures about a steep increase in immigration were ‘good news’.

The Home Secretary vented her anger at the Business Secretary and called on the Prime Minister to limit the movement of foreign labour.

Lib Dem Mr Cable was responding to figures showing  that net migration to the UK jumped by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013, powered by a 40 per cent rise  in the number of people taking advantage of European laws on free movement.

Mrs May, writing in today’s Mail on 
Sunday, expresses her alarm at the figures, which come despite David 
Cameron’s promise at the last Election to slash net migration to the 
‘tens of thousands’ by 2015.

And she slapped down Mr Cable for claiming it was a sign of Britain’s booming economy.

‘Vince
 Cable said this rise was “good news”. I do not agree,’ writes Mrs May, 
before going on to complain: ‘At the moment we are bound by the treaties
 that successive governments have signed. These mean we cannot impose 
formal immigration controls on EU migrants.’

She
 argues that Mr Cameron’s plans to claw back powers from Brussels prior 
to a referendum on EU membership in 2017 should be used as an 
opportunity to change European laws on migration. The Home Secretary 
wants new member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before 
their workers are allowed to travel to the UK to find employment.

Some
 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to 
September 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the 
previous year.

Those numbers
 are likely to rise, as the statistics pre-date the lifting of border 
controls on Romanians and Bulgarians  on January 1.

Mr
 Cable, who is to the left of most of the Lib Dems, and Mrs May, who is 
on the right of the Tories, are both keen to establish their leadership 
credentials ahead of any potential contest after the 2015 vote.

In
 his provocative remarks last week, Mr Cable said: ‘Actually, those 
figures are good news because the reason net immigration is going up is 
because fewer British people are emigrating and surely that’s a good 
thing – people are getting jobs here.’

Mrs
 May’s rebuke to Vince Cable came as former Tory Defence Secretary Liam 
Fox warned Mr Cameron that he must ditch the ‘statistical nonsense’ of 
his immigration policy and adopt a radical plan to reduce the number of 
immigrants in Britain if the Prime Minister wants to win back voters 
from UKIP.

He added it would be ‘dangerous complacency’ if Mr Cameron were to ignore the electoral threat posed by UKIP.
