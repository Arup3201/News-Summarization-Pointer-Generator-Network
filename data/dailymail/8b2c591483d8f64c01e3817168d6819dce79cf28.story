A Muslim family who thought they were buying a cheese and onion pasty were sold one containing a meat they are not allowed to eat

Then the supermarket rubbed salt in the wound by offering a bottle of champagne, which Muslims are not allowed to drink, as an apology.

Majid Khan, 28, from Canton, Cardiff, bought the pasty labelled cheese and onion from Morrisons.

Yousuf Khan, three, ate the pasty, which contained meat that is banned in his culture

But when his son Yousuf, three, began to eat it he complained about the taste.

His parents found the past contained potato and minced beef that was non-halal - the cow had not been ritually slaughtered.

Mr Khan bought a total of three pasties, one of which was mislabelled, on special offer for 57p

The Khan family has now attacked the supermarket for their ignorance in making the error

After realising the mistake, he rang the branch of Morrisons in Cardiff Bay where the manager apologised - and caused further insult by offering them a free bottle of alcoholic bubbly in compensation.

Two of the cheese and onion pasties were correctly labelled - but the third one actually contained non-halal minced meat

Garage worker Mr Khan, 28, said: 'It is ridiculous and ignorant of our faith - not just once but twice.

'Firstly they should be far more careful with how they label their products, especially when it could contain meat.

'But then it is completely wrong of the manager to then give us champagne when Muslims don’t drink alcohol.

'I feel highly insulted. I don’t want this happening to any other people who are Muslim.'

Mr Khan and his wife Nadia, 29, of Canton, Cardiff, said he will never shop at Morrisons again after the humiliating blunder.

The pasties were marked down to 19p from their usual price of 85p.

Mr Khan said: 'I put it down to human error, everybody makes mistakes.

'But it didn't seem like the manager was really paying attention to the real problem.'

Mrs Khan said the pasties were bought for Yousuf and his three older sisters Ruheena, 10, Amara, eight, and Areesa, four.

She said: 'I put them in the microwave and gave the first one to Yousuf.

'I heard him moaning a bit and was saying: "It’s not nice".

'I looked at the filling and it was brown meat and potato - he’s had a couple of bites by then.'

Mrs Khan said it was an awful insult to be offered alcohol as compensation for the meat blunder.

Red-faced Morrisons said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error

She said: 'The duty manager said we could come and have a bottle of wine or champagne on the house.

'I’m really disappointed in their response - they didn’t really care. They were ignorant and lazy.'

Red-faced Morrisons said they were taking the incident seriously and are looking into the error.

A spokesman said: 'Clearly this is not good customer service.

'We apologise for the mistake and any offence caused to Mr Khan and his family.

'We take labelling our products very seriously and we are looking into why this particular product was mislabelled.

'We know we have to be extra careful when labelling meat.

'We have 11 million people coming to our stores every week and we put this down to human error.

'As a result of this incident, we will reinforce the training and standards in the store to make sure it doesn’t happen again.'

Morrisons said they are currently in touch with Mr Khan to discuss a more suitable way of compensating his family.

Halal are foods that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shariah law.

Meat must come from a supplier that uses halal practices. The slaughter should be performed by a Muslim who must start by invoking the name of Allah.
