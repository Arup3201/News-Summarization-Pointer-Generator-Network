Of all the states in the nation, Maryland once again reported the highest concentration of millionaires, according to an annual survey conducted by a wealth research firm.

A report released this week by the New York-based Phoenix Marketing International showed that there were just over 6million millionaire households in the nation - an increase of 53,000 from the year before.

In other words, 1 of 20 households in the U.S. has more than $1million in investible assets, not counting the value of real estate. 

Spreading the wealth: Maryland was ranked No. 1 on list of states boasting the highest numbers of millionaires for third straight year thanks to 167,287 households with more than $1million in investibale assets

For a third consecutive year, the top spot in the rankings went to Maryland, where 167,287 households, or 7.7 per cent of all households in the state, boasted more than $1million in assets.

Maryland is located in close proximity to Washington, DC  - ranked No. 10 on the list - and many of the nation's top statesmen, power brokers and wealthy lobbyists own homes there.

For similar reasons, the capital's other neighbor, Virginia, was ranked seventh on the list of states boasting the greatest number of millionaires.

New Jersey and Connecticut were ranked second and third, respectively, moving up one spot on the list from the year before. 

New York was ranked 12th for a sixth straight year, with just over 429,000 households reporting more than $1million in assets.

Hawaii, which was dethroned in 2011 by Maryland as the state with the highest concentration of millionaires, in 2013 was in a fourth place, followed by Alaska - the only other state outside the northeast that made it into the top ten.

'Most improved' state: North Dakota jumped 14 spots on the list from 43rd in 2012 to 29th last year due to an energy boom in the state

However, it was unpretentious North Dakota - a state few people associate with extreme affluence - that delivered the biggest surprise on the survey by jumping 14 spots from 43rd in 2012 to 29th last year.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the 'Roughrider State' owed its stratospheric increase in the number of millionaires to an energy boom in the Bakken shale region.

Maine and Louisiana also enjoyed a good year, climbing 11 and 10 spots in the rankings, respectively. But other parts of the country did not fare as well in the millionairesâ€™ department.

Still feeling the pinch of the economic downturn, Nevada plummeted 20 points to No. 39, while Arizona, Idaho, Florida and Michigan all slid down in the rankings more than 10 positions.
