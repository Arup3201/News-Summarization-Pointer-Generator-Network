A spectator ran on to the circuit at Leicester Racecourse and dangerously sprinted alongside the horses during the Cream Gorse Handicap on Saturday.

Jockeys were forced to steer their horses either side of the man, who was wearing a pink shirt and black trousers, to avoid an accident at the course.

Luckily no-one was injured and the race was completed as scheduled.
