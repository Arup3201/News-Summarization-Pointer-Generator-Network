Found: Karl Josiah's body is believed to have been in his snow-covered car for six days before he was discovered

A young man lay undiscovered in his car for nearly a week after skidding off the motorway in snow and suffering fatal injuries.

Karl Josiah, 23, was discovered dead inside his Renault Clio after the car came off the busy road and tumbled down a steep embankment.

The mangled wreckage of the black car was then covered by a thick blanket of snow for up to six days after up to 10cms fell.

Motorists drove past the snow-covered ditch for days, completely unaware that the car was there.

As the ice began to thaw the car was eventually spotted by a Highways Agency team and the grim discovery of the body was made.

Paramedics rushed to the roadside but were unable to help Mr Josiah who was declared dead in the wreckage of the car.

His body was discovered between Junction 6 at Windsor, Berkshire, and Junction 5 at Datchet, Berkshire, on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 at around 1.05pm on January 23.

It is not known whether if he was discovered earlier he could have survived.

Police were today appealing for any witnesses who may have seen the car to come forward.

It was believed that Mr Josiah, who was from London, had left his home on January 18 as heavy snow and blizzards hit Berkshire.

Mr Josiah's parents David and May Josiah paid tribute to their son.

'He was a shining light that lit up all the lives of all that knew him,' they said in a statement.

'He will always be loved and missed but not forgotten.'
