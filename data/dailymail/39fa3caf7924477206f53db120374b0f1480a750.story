Millions of parents whose young children have a child trust fund will be allowed to transfer the money into a junior Isa, the Daily Mail can reveal.

It is a landmark victory for this newspaper’s Money Mail section which has campaigned for more than two years for the absurd rule, which currently bans the transfer, to be scrapped.

George Osborne, the Chancellor, said the decision ‘supports hard-working families who want to save for their children.’

Child Trust Funds were launched by the Labour government more than a decade ago, with an average voucher of £250 given to babies born between September 1, 2002 and 2 January 2011.

Around 6.3million children have a Child Trust Fund with a total of £5billion invested in these nest eggs, with extra money contributed by relatives and friends.

When the Coalition came to power, they were scrapped and replaced by the Junior Isas.

But, to the fury of millions of parents, children with a Child Trust Fund were not allowed to open a Junior Isa and were not allowed to move money from a Child Trust Fund into a Junior Isa.

As a result, the money was left locked in Child Trust Fund accounts paying dire rates, while Junior Isas were paying far more generous rates.

The best rate for a Junior cash Isa is currently six per cent, but the best rate for a child trust fund is half this amount.

If a parent put £300 a month into their child’s account from birth until his or her 18th birthday, it would total £118,800 in the Junior cash Isa.

But the child with the Child Trust Fund paying a rate of only three per cent would get £86,000 despite their parents’ making exactly the same contribution, a difference of nearly £33,000.

To make matters worse, some Child Trust Fund providers imposed rip-off charges.

For example, Britain’s oldest investment company, Foreign & Colonial, hit its savers with a £30 annual fee, which would decimate a £250 savings pot in just eight years.

Mr Osborne told the Daily Mail: ‘This Government supports hard-working families who want to save for their children.

‘So I’m delighted that, as a result of these changes, over six million children who currently have savings in a Child Trust Fund will be able to benefit from better returns and lower charges on those savings.’

The Government hopes to make the transfers legal ‘as soon as possible’, with the change expected to take place in April 2015.

The move is a relief for families, many 
of whom worried that the unfair transfer ban was creating an unfair 
divide between their offspring, where the eldest might have a Child 
Trust Fund but a younger sibling has a junior Isa.

For the last two years, the Treasury has insisted there is no difference between the two types of accounts.

But the announcement, which is expected today, endorses the Mail’s campaign, which has been supported by major banks, investment firms and financial advisers.

Parents were penalised, not just by lower rates and rip-off charges on child trust funds, but also a chronic lack of choice.

A dwindling number of banks and building societies offer Child Trust Funds, while Junior Isa savers can choose from a huge number of options. Around £550million is currently held in Junior Isas by around 300,000 children.

When they reach 18, Junior Isa savers can move their money directly into a tax-efficient adult Isa, but a quirk in the legislation meant that those with Child Trust Funds were only able to move their money into taxable accounts.

Parents were not given a £250 voucher to put into their child’s Junior Isa, but they can invest up to £3,720 every tax year into their child’s nest egg. The same amount can also be invested into a Child Trust Fund every year.

Saving up: Helen and Gareth Driver with Chester (left) and Charlie

Helen and Gareth Driver are relieved they will now be able to treat their children in the same way.

The couple have two boys. The eldest, Charlie, who is three, has a Child Trust Fund, but the younger, Chester, who is one, has a Junior Isa.

Both are held with the Skipton Building Society, but they pay different rates.

Mrs Driver, 32, who works as a team manager for Co-op supermarkets, said the administration of two different accounts has been annoying.

The fact that one of her sons gets a better deal than her other child is also something that bothers her because it seems unfair.

Charlie’s account pays 2.65 per cent, but this is trumped by his younger brother, who gets 3.02 per cent.

If the children are given money at Christmas or for their birthdays, it is put into the accounts to give them a helping hand when they reach 18.

Mrs Driver, from Malton, North Yorkshire, said: ‘We are delighted that Charlie can switch. He will earn a better rate and he will avoid having his money taxed when he reaches 18. 

‘It will also be much easier for us to keep track of just one account.’
