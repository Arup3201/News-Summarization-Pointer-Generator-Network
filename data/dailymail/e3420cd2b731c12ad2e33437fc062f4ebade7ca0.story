Traffic at a busy Sydney road was brought briefly to a halt when a van that appeared to have no-one behind the wheel reversed its way across the intersection.

The ghost van was caught in action at the Alison Road and Botany Street intersection at Randwick on video by Lee Henderson who uploaded the footage on YouTube.

In the 22-second video, which so far has attracted more than 300 views, the van cuts in front of a motorbike while travelling down Alison Rd.

About a week ago a white van - that seemed to have no driver - interrupted traffic at a busy Randwick intersection, in Sydney's inner city

The van rolled backwards across five lanes of trafficÂ 

As it passes in front of camera lens, no-one is spotted driving the white van as it makes its way from one side of the road to the other.

A pedestrian crossing the road appears unfazed by the incident while the motorcyclist continues watching it as it crosses their path.

The van is finally stopped after it runs into at least one car parked on Alison Rd.

It is believed the incident happened about a week ago.

Bizarrely, the traffic interruption was not been reported to New South Wales Police.

A police spokesman said enquiries to eastern Local Command Area stations had turned up no reports of the ghost van.

He said it was believed no one was injured during the incident.

It finally came to a stop when it hit at least one parked car
