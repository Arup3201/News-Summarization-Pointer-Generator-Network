In the dock: Detective sergeant Peter Yeates was jailed at Portsmouth Crown Court after stealing at least £10,000 of mobile phones and electronic equipment

A policeman and uncle of murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates stole gadgets worth thousands of pounds because her death left his life in ‘turmoil’, a judge heard yesterday.

Detective Sergeant Peter Yeates admitted taking digital cameras and smartphones from police stations before selling them on the internet.

The officer, who had been commended six times while working for a specialist crime unit, stole the confiscated stolen goods and lost property from storerooms.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard yesterday that Yeates, 51, changed from being the ‘perfect policeman’ after the breakdown of his marriage and the murder of Joanna, who was also his goddaughter.

Miss Yeates, 25, was killed by Dutch neighbour Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for life in 2011 after admitting strangling her.

During police interviews, Yeates said her death affected him ‘significantly’.

He had a breakdown in August 2011 and took several weeks off work to recover.

Ian Lawrie QC, defending, said: ‘The tragedy of what happened to his goddaughter is one of a number of features over two and a half years where there were domestic issues.

'You can see the stark contrast between the man who was a perfect policeman for 20 years and the dramatic fall from grace. His sense of shame is considerable.’

Yeates, who was one of two officers with access to Dorset Police’s property store, sold 461 mobile phones to an online recycling firm from January 2009 to March last year, making more than £10,600.

He took the items saying they were needed as props by the force’s major crime unit during operations.

But investigators found he put 17 phones up for sale on the internet on the day 22 were taken from a store at Weymouth police station.

Three digital cameras sold by Yeates on eBay came from the property store.

Murder: The killing of Joanna Yeates by her neighbour Vincent Tabak shocked the country, and her uncle Peter said that and his marriage break-up left his life in turmoil

Well-spoken Yeates, who grew up in 
colonial Rhodesia and was known by colleagues as ‘Posh Pete’ and ‘Yuppie
Yeates’, was arrested just three weeks from retirement in October last 
year.

He was charged days after retiring, 
which meant he was able to keep his full pension, estimated to be worth 
around £30,000 a year.

He later admitted four counts of theft totalling £5,000.

Judge Ian Pearson said: ‘It is a sad 
day indeed when an officer of your standing appears before this court on
multiple offences of dishonesty.

'I take into account that during this
period of offending you were experiencing difficulties in your personal
life and that halfway through this time you had to deal with the tragic
murder of your niece.

‘Any offence carried out by a serving police officer causes damage to the faith the public have in our police forces.’

Yeates was jailed for 34 weeks, ordered to pay £500 costs, and told to return £8,000.

More than 8,000 crimes take place 
inside police stations each year, including the theft of police cars, 
uniforms and even handcuffs.
