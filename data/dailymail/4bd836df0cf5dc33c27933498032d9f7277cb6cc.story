A coach driver left his passengers stranded after he quit his job at the wheel after repeatedly getting lost during a journey to an airport.

The National Express coach was travelling from Bradford in West Yorkshire to Heathrow on Tuesday night when the frustrated driver told passengers he has 'no idea' where he was going, before ringing up his bosses and quitting.

He told customers he was not allowed a satnav as National Express bosses believe they look 'unprofessional.'

At one point during the 'nightmare' seven-hour journey the coach was stuck on an industrial estate in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, for 25 minutes while the driver looked for Luton railway station.

The coach journey normally has around 11 scheduled stops, including Luton railway station and Luton airport bus station.

Trevor Wright, a passenger on the coach, told The Sun: 'People tried to talk to him but he refused to communicate. 

'He called his controller and said, "why did you put a driver on a route he doesn't know? These directions are s**t. I've never done this f***ing route."'

Mr Wright added that the driver eventually used a phone to find Luton railway station but then went 'ballistic' after he accidentally drove the wrong way up a one-way street.

When the coach eventually made it to the railway station the coach driver called his boss and quit the job, telling them: 'I've had enough of this job, it's problem after problem.'

Some passengers took to Twitter to vent their anger at National Express during their 'nightmare' journey

After getting lost the driver took the passengers to Luton railway station (pictured) where around 20 were left stranded and were forced to catch taxis to get them to Heathrow in order to catch their flights

The Sun reported that 20 passengers were then forced to get taxis to Heathrow in a desperate bid to catch their flights, while the driver took the rest to Luton Airport and would not drive any further.

Some passengers took to Twitter to vent their anger. 

Yimika Edun said: 'Shouldn't there be some sort of gps system on board to assist the driver? We pay for efficient service @nationalexpress' and 'People have to get off to take taxis now. Additional expenses. Thanks so much @nationalexpress.' 

Another user, who had friends on the coach, wrote: 'Appaz the driver quit before they entered Luton. When they got there he just parked and called national express to say he quit.' 

A National Express spokesman said: 'One of our coaches was delayed on its way to Heathrow Airport yesterday.

'Unfortunately, this delay meant the driver had exceeded his maximum legal driving hours and so on arrival at Luton Airport - which is a scheduled stop on this route - customers were moved onto an alternative coach. 

'We understand delays are always frustrating and we do of course apologise for the inconvenience caused.'
