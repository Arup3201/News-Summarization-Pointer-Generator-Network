A killer left a father of newborn twins dying in a pool of blood after a brutal attack with a pick axe handle - then told a concerned friend: 'He's just chilling.'

Arron Ward, 28, bludgeoned recruitment consultant Eddie Worton, 31, over the head after they got embroiled in a petty argument over a taxi.

As the victim was left to die inside a house, Ward fled and refused to call an ambulance.

When the friend called up to check Mr Worton was ok, he told him: 'Eddie tried decking us in and I have hit him on the back of the head. He's sound man - just chilling.'

Police were alerted later by Ward's 
aunt before breaking into the house in Middleton, Greater 
Manchester. There they found Mr Worton's body in the lounge.

It
later emerged the dead man's father had been battered and then left to 
die in an almost identical attack just three years earlier.

Today,
at Manchester Crown Court, Ward wept as he was jailed for nine years 
after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. His not guilty plea to murder 
was accepted by the prosecution.

The
tragedy occurred last February just six months after Mr Worton, a fitness 
fanatic, holiday camp worker and amateur boxer originally from 
Canterbury, Kent, became a father to twins Edward and Poppy after his 
girlfriend underwent five years of IVF treatment.

Andrew
Menary QC prosecuting said Mr Worton and Ward had been 'good friends' and 
on the night of the killing had been out together in Manchester city 
centre.

They ended up back 
at the home of Ward's brother Vincent, 27, for a party and in the early 
hours arrangements were made for Mr Worton and other guests to get a cab 
home.

'It was clear that morning in February
was a very cold, freezing morning,' said Mr Menary. 'The people inside 
the address heard a noise and assumed it was the taxi so they left to go
home.

'However the noise they heard outside was not the arrival of the taxi but some neighbours going to work that morning.

'Edward
wanted to wait inside but Vincent was keen to go back to bed and didn't
want him back inside the address and told him to leave. An argument 
began and Vincent was heard saying "get out I'm going to bed Ed".

'Edward
was complaining it was too cold and said "I'm just waiting for a taxi".
Arron told Ed to leave and Vincent pushed Edward. This resulted in 
violence and Edward was heard to say "I'll do you both in".'

A few minutes later the other guests got their cab leaving behind the two Ward brothers and Mr Worton having a row.

Mr Menary said: 'The situation soon 
escalated quickly resulting in Edward Worton being struck over the head.
It was a vicious beating involving the use of at least one weapon which
by the end left him dead or dying. He had terrible injuries to his 
head.'

Both brothers then left the house and locked the door leaving Mr Worton to die inside.

One
of the guests later phoned Arron later to find out what had happened 
and he replied: 'Eddy tried decking us in. I have hit him on the back of
the head'. He asked Ward if Mr Worton was ok and Ward said: 'Yeah, sound 
man, yeah' and said he was 'chilling'.

But
the QC said: 'Edward Worton was far from sound. It was likely he was 
already dead. He had multiple blows to the head and catastrophic 
injuries, he was never going to get up and follow anyone.'

Ward returned to the house realised Mr Worton was dead but instead of calling police or an ambulance went to 
see his aunt with Vincent. She took both men to Bury Police Station and 
they handed themselves in.

The court heard there was a blood 
spattered set of dumbbells near to Mr Worton's body with and a pickaxe 
propped up in the kitchen. Ward later claimed he killed Mr Worton whilst 
protecting his brother who had just been headbutted by the victim.

But it emerged the killer had just six months before the attack been given a suspended jail term for violent disorder.

In
a victim impact statement Mr Worton's girlfriend Michelle Bork, 29, said: 
'Eddie was my best friend and father of their six month old babies and 
he was taken from them.

'Someone is going to have to explain to 
those children when they're older what happened to their daddy and what 
happened to the man who killed him.'

The victim's sister

'I feel like my heart has been 
crushed. I used to be confident, outgoing and loving and always looking 
forward to the future and I can no longer love life, He was our 
protector, I now feel vulnerable'.

In mitigation defence counsel Nigel 
Power said: 'The defendant ended up losing control, fearing for what may
have happened to his brother. We submit that Mr Worton was an 
individual who when angry was very strong and who was very difficult to 
restrain.'

But passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told Ward: 'What happened was all out of proportion. He was your friend.

'You and your brother made no attempt to seek assistance and I have been driven to the conclusion that you knew he was lifeless when you left him. You called your solicitor a very considerable time later but never attempted to assist him.'

Vincent was cleared of murder at an earlier hearing.

In 2009 Mr Worton's father Ted, 52, a former miner, was battered with a mallet and then left to die during a party at his home in Ramsgate, Kent.

The killer who left Ted lying in a pool of blood for almost two hours was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter and was jailed for ten years. It emerged he had been on licence at the time of the attack.

Last month Eddie's family told of their disgust at Ward escaping a murder conviction. His mum Claire said: 'All we wanted was justice for Ed and now we feel let down.

'We're disgusted with what's happened and the outcome. We don't feel like we've been given justice as a family for the loss we suffered.'

His sister Katie, 31, said: 'Someone is going to have to explain to those children when they're older what happened to their daddy and what happened to the man who killed him.

'Even if he gets the maximum sentence he could be out walking the streets in six or seven years. Ed's two children will only be seven and we'll be left to explain that to them.

'We had been preparing for a two-week murder trial and didn't know anything about this until we got to court.

'We were just pulled into a side room and told this is what's going to happen and you don't have a say in it. We couldn't believe it. It was such a shock.'
