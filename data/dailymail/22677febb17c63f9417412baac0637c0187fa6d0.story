Most wanted: Martin John Power, 46, is sought by the Metropolitan Police for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud mortgage lenders out of an estimated £7 million

The identities of Britain's nine 'most wanted' criminals thought to be hiding in Cyprus have been revealed today.

The eight men and one woman on the run are accused of various crimes including rape, drug dealing and perverting the course of justice.

Their identities have been released amid fears that northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, could become the equivalent of the Costa del Sol where criminals escaped to in the 70s and 80s as they couldn't be extradited back to the UK. 

The nine are believed to currently be residing in the Republic 
of Cyprus but some may cross the Green Line into the self-declared 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to avoid being extradited back to the UK if arrested under a European warrant.

Crimestoppers released the list of the nine 'most wanted' compiled by the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Cypriot authorities in a bid to help bring them to justice.

The list includes Paul Lockwood, 41, who is
sought by Greater Manchester Police for allegedly raping a child.

Wayne
Smith, 38, is wanted by West Midlands Police for his role in a 
horrific road accident that killed a 22-year-old man while his girlfriend Julie Anne Skelding, 40, is being sought for perverting the course of justice.

Greek-Cypriot Costas 
Sampson, 21, accused of raping a woman in Ruislip, Middlesex.

The
list also has details of suspects accused of drug dealing and fraud, 
including Martin John Power, 46, who is sought by the Metropolitan 
Police for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to defraud mortgage 
lenders out of an estimated £7 million.

Martin Evans, 50, from 
Swansea, is wanted for running a drug-dealing gang between 1999 and 2001.

Founder
of Crimestoppers Lord Ashcroft said: 'My hope is that we shall see more
success in bringing some of the UK’s most wanted fugitives to justice.

On the run: Cypriot national Hasan Akarcay, 56, left,  is wanted by West Yorkshire Police over allegations of dealing class A drugs and Paul Lockwood, 41, right, is sought by Greater Manchester Police for allegedly raping a girl between the ages of six and 10

Suspects: Timur Mehmet, 39, left, from Buckinghamshire, was convicted in his absence and jailed for eight years for conspiracy to cheat the public revenue in a £25 million fraud and Greek-Cypriot Costas Sampson, 21, is wanted by the Metropolitan Police over allegations he raped a woman who he met at a club

Safe haven: The nine most wanted are believed to be in the Republic of Cyprus but could cross into Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus, pictured, where it would be harder to extradite them to the UK

'While
these suspected criminals will see Cyprus as a safe place to evade law 
enforcement, my belief is that with the help of the local public and 
expatriate community, these individuals will not be able to escape 
justice for much longer.'

The scheme, called Operation Zygos, targets criminals who could be hiding in the Republic of Cyprus or Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus.

Tycoon Asil Nadir evaded justice for nearly two decades after fleeing Britain to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 after being accused of theft following the collapse of his Polly Peck empire.

It was not until August 2010 that Nadir returned to London claiming he could not live with the ‘burning sense of injustice’.

But he was jailed after finally being convicted of stealing millions from his business to fund his extraordinary luxury lifestyle.

Cypriot Mehmet Salih, 41, left, is wanted by Leicestershire Police for alleged cocaine dealing between December 2010 and November 2011 and Martin Evans, 50, from Swansea, right, is wanted for drug dealing, theft and fraudulent trading

Wayne Smith, 38, left, is wanted by West Midlands Police for his role 
in an horrific road accident that killed a 22-year-old man and his girlfriend, the only woman on the list, Julie Anne Skelding, 40, is wanted for perverting the course of justice

Crimestoppers are appealing for anyone 
with information about the nine most wanted and their location to come 
forward regardless what part of the island the suspect is in.

Deputy director of Soca Martin Molloy 
said: 'Fugitives hiding overseas typically remain part of the criminal 
world, continuing to bring harm to communities locally and beyond.

'Soca and our partners are determined to ensure life on the run is intolerable for them, and that they are returned to face justice in the UK.'
