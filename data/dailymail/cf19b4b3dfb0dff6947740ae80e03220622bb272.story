Bum rap? Keith Mason is suing Huddersfield 
Giants for wrongful dismissal after his sacking over a picture of a teammate's bottom posted to his Twitter

A rugby league star is suing his former club for £300,000 after he was sacked over a tweet featuring a picture of a teammate's backside.

Keith Mason, 31, has taken Super League side the Huddersfield Giants to court following his dismissal last October for gross misconduct.

The prop, who was one of the Giants' highest paid players, was sacked weeks after a picture of teammate Scott Moore's behind was posted to his Twitter account, where it stayed for around 48 hours.

The hearing, which started today at Leeds High Court and is slated to last two days, heard the photograph was taken as Mr Mason, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was celebrating after the final game of last season.

The court was told that after Mr Mason returned home from the party on September 18 last year, his girlfriend came across the picture, which Mr Mason claims was taken without his knowledge, while looking through his phone.

She then uploaded the picture on to his Twitter account, to which he had around 4,200 followers, with the comment 'what the hell is this', the court heard.

The court heard many of Mr Mason’s followers would have been Giants fans or rugby league fans in general and could have potentially seen the Tweet.

Mr Mason went through the club’s disciplinary process and was dismissed for gross misconduct.

The court was told the club thought the content of the Tweet was contrary to their family values and Mr Mason’s position as a role model.

Martin Budworth, for Mr Mason, said: 'He has a considerable number of followers and the club believe the image could have been viewed by a considerable number of people.'

At the time of his dismissal Mr Mason was one of the team’s highest paid players. After playing seven seasons for the West Yorkshire team he was sacked with nearly three years left on his contract.

Mr Mason, who has brought a case of wrongful dismissal against the club, does not believe all the facts of his sacking add up, his lawyer said. The court heard that just days after he left, the club had hired two new players to fill his position on a lower salary than his.

Giving evidence, Mr Mason, who has also played for Wakefield, Melbourne and St Helens and is currently in his second spell with the Castleford Tigers, described himself as 'respected' and a 'professional athlete' and agreed that as a player with the Giants he was 'immersed in holding up family values'.

He told the court that ‘Mad Monday’, 
when the photo was taken, was a time for the players to let their hair 
down and that he was out from Sunday until Tuesday afternoon and had 
consumed alcohol.

When he 
got back home he said he was 'rather worse for wear and with no sleep' 
and didn’t know his girlfriend had posted the picture.

'If I’d seen the Tweet in the right frame of mind I would have taken it down straight away,' he told the court. 'I’ve never Tweeted anything of this nature.

'There is no way ever I would leave a picture on my Twitter to offend anyone, especially someone’s backside.'

Mr Mason denied deliberately keeping the picture up until his agent told him to take it down. He said his agent never notified him about it and he took it down when he got over his hangover.

He said: 'When I came round I took it off. I never thought at the time I would be getting a sacking two or three weeks later.'

The hearing continues.
