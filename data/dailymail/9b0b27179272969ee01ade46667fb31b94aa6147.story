Schools in deprived areas are denying pupils access to tougher GCSE subjects in a bid to improve their league table ranking, research suggests.

Particular concerns have been raised over access to triple science GCSE, with up to half the schools in some areas refusing to offer it, according to data published today.

Researchers said it was clear school leaders were trying to minimise poor exam results by ushering pupils towards easier subjects.

Some GCSE students are being steered away from more difficult subjects by schools keen to boost their rankings, according to a report by the Open Public Services Network (OPSN) at the RSA think-tank

The alarming findings come after the Government launched a crackdown on schools trying to ‘play’ the system by refusing to include poor-quality qualifications in league tables.

The research, carried out by Open Public Services Network (OPSN) at the RSA think-tank, showed access to tough subjects varied according to postcode. 

Roger Taylor, chairman of the OPSN, said: ‘This would be of little concern if these differences reflected the needs and choices of pupils and families.

‘Our worry is that instead they reflect decisions made by schools and are based on calculations as to how schools can appear better on league tables by encouraging children to avoid taking on more challenging subjects.’

He added that the evidence suggests in areas where most children are expected to do less well in exams, ‘the educational opportunities for all children are being restricted’.

The figures show in North East Lincolnshire, 50 per cent of the ten secondary schools did not offer triple science GCSE. 

More than a third of schools do not enter any pupils for triple science in Knowsley, Slough, Kingston upon Hull and Newcastle. 

In contrast, in Sussex and Cumbria – local authorities with more than 30 schools – every school offers GCSEs in three sciences.

The disparity is so huge that children in Knowsley, Merseyside, are half as likely to be enrolled for triple science GCSE as children in Buckinghamshire. 

Children in Kensington are four times more likely to be enrolled for a language GCSE than children in Middlesbrough where, on average, only one child in every four takes a language GCSE.

RSA Director of Public Services, Charlotte Alldritt, said: ‘Breadth of subject availability is being denied to our young people and curtailing their life chances’

In a report to be published next week, the RSA will warn of ‘subject deserts’ within certain local authorities, with pupils not given the option of finding a school which offers the subjects they want to study.

The report will argue that local authorities are unlikely to be able to tackle the problem with a growing number of schools converting to academy status – and thus enjoying greater autonomy.

It will also lay out concerns about the Department of Education’s ‘accountability regime’, in which schools are rated on the number of points they achieve in exams.

The report will argue the system can incentivise schools to offer more limited opportunities to children in an effort to maximise the school’s rating.

RSA Director of Public Services, Charlotte Alldritt, said: ‘Breadth of subject availability is being denied to our young people and curtailing their life chances.’

Last month, league tables showed twice as many state secondary schools are now considered to be underperforming compared with last year.

The increase was because of new rules that banned schools from including results from re-sits and poor-quality vocational courses.

Critics at the time said the changes had impacted schools operating in poor areas the most.
