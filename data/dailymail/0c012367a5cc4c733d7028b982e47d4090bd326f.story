A holiday home owner has ensured that his guests get the very best of the sunshine whatever the weather - by creating a beach in his front room.

Bringing the tropics to Dymchurch, Kent, Karl Emanuelsson has transformed his home into a luxury Caribbean style retreat - complete with real sand, palm trees and deck chairs.

Holiday makers can relax in 33 degree heat with a drink and listen to music as they bathe under the 'sun', created by cutting edge Swedish technology which replicates natural sunlight.

The room is believed to be the only beach room of its kind in the world - and, he claims, it’s even possible to tan safely and without suncream because the light is only as strong as natural sunlight but with greatly reduced UV rays.

Conjuring images of St Tropez or the Bahamas the luxury holiday home is complete with real sand, palm trees and deck chairs - but the luxury beach house is actually in Dymchurch, Kent

Guests can heat the room to a 33 degrees Celsius as they listen to the sound of waves lapping at the shore and are cooled by a gentle breeze thanks to a surround sound stereo and a wind fan

But the retreat comes without the price tag of a foreign holiday or the harmful skin damage exposure to the sun can bring as the dangerous UV rays have been filtered to a safe level.

It’s such a lifelike replica for the natural glow from real sunlight, the holiday home has even been popular among people affected seasonal affective disorder looking to rid themselves of the winter blues.

For £1200, up to six adults can spend a week out of season sunning themselves on the 'beach'. And if the weather does turn out to be good enough to go outside, the luxury retreat is just a stone's throw from the Kent coastline and a private beach for guests

The property even has a bar area with soft lighting, stools and chandeliers

The bedrooms have all been luxuriously decorated in a Mediterranean style

As well as the beach room, the three bedroom 17th century cottage is complete with a cinema room, a Jacuzzi bath and an open plan dining room and kitchen.

Owner Karl Emanuelsson, 38, said: 'The beach is invigorating - it really lifts you.

'People are so intrigued by the idea of sunning themselves inside when the weather outside is awful - especially in the winter.

'With the sand and the palm trees and the DJ decks, it’s ready for a real beach party or just a relaxing day on the shore.

'My family and I love it and so do guests.'

Jess Waters from QuirkyAccom.com which takes bookings for cottage said: 'The Beach Sun Retreat is popular as you aren’t reliant on the British climate to be entertained on holiday there.

'With the beach room, the mini cinema and the sun loungers it would be hard to go out even if the weather outside was good.

'We’ve seen more Brits looking to holiday in the UK, perhaps due to financial pressures at the moment. This way you get the sun, sea and sand without having to step on a plane - it’s the best of both worlds.'

The rays are exactly the same as natural sunlight and it is possible for sunbathers to safely work on their tan
