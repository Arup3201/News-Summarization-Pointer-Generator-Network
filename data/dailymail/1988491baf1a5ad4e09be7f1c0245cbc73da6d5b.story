As survivors and victims' families are forced to relive the grisly details of the night James Holmes allegedly went on a gun rampage at a Colorado movie theater, one woman sits quietly, taking notes.

Misty Benjamin is unlike any other at the trial - the 30-year-old sits in the overflow section of the  Arapahoe County courthouse in support of the man who is accused of shooting dead 12 people and injuring 70 more.

Benjamin has even dyed her hair a shocking red in support of Holmes, of whom she says: 'I don’t think he is a bad guy. What he did was bad.'

The University of Phoenix graduate said that she made the decision to dye her hair so that 25-year-old Holmes would know that he had her support.

She added: 'Tons of people are hating me because I’m deciding to be compassionate and show compassion for a person that committed a horrendous crime.'

Benjamin lives in the town of Aurora which was changed forever on July 20 last year when a gunman entered a midnight showing of the Dark Knight Rises and sprayed bullets into the audience.

Over three emotional days of pre-trial hearings, a succession of police and federal agents testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing guns and ammunition, concocted explosives to booby-trap his apartment and scouted the movie theater where he would allegedly unleash a horrific attack on hundreds of terrified people.

On Wednesday, prosecutor Karen Pearson showed a series of photos that investigators said Holmes took of himself hours before the massacre.

In one, he glares through black contact lenses, sticking out his tongue, as two locks of his orange-dyed hair curl out on either side of his head like horns.

Despite the horrifying details, Misty Benjamin told the Daily Beast: 'When they showed photos of him, everything I saw were cries for help.

She added: 'When I first saw him, I was physically attracted to him. I thought, oh crap. I think he is cute.'

Benjamin, who joined the Church of Latter Day Saints in 2004 when her dentist committed suicide, admits that she keeps pictures of Holmes in her wallet and writes messages for him in the yellow notebook she carries to court.

She also wears a plastic bracelet to court inscribed with the word 'besties' - her best friend in Michigan has the same. The pair met through a 'James Holmes is Innocent' Facebook group.

For the women are not alone - Holmes has developed a bizarre fan base who call themselves 'Holmies', revere plaid clothing and Slurpees - which the suspected killer once mentioned a liking for.

On Facebook, thousands of people have joined fan pages for Holmes where court sketches, memes and messages of support are written.

Tumblr accounts have also been created, encouraging Holmes supporters to write to him in prison to 'let him know you care'.

Misty, however, is keen to distance herself from these 'groupies', saying that she doesn't believe Holmes is innocent, just that he is in need of support as a human being.

A judge ruled late on Thursday that there’s enough evidence for Holmes to face trial for the murdered 12 people and 70 injured.

Judge William Sylvester said prosecutors have established probable cause to proceed with 166 felony counts, including murder and attempted murder.

Holmes is due to be arraigned on Friday, but his defense attorneys filed papers on Thursday afternoon saying he’s not ready to enter a plea.

They are likely to appear in court on Friday to ask for the arraignment to be delayed.

Defense attorneys did not explain why they are not ready for arraignment. Their filing also objected to media requests to bring cameras into the courtroom.

Other than during his brief initial appearance in July, cameras have been barred from court during Holmes’ case.

Sylvester’s ruling came after a 
three-day hearing earlier this week, in which prosecutors laid out their
case against Holmes, 25.

The officers also described a hellish
scene inside the theater on July 20, when 12 people were shot to death 
before their families and friends’ eyes and scores of others were 
wounded amid a din of gunshots, screams and the blaring soundtrack of 
the latest Batman movie.

Holmes’ lawyers called no witnesses 
and cross-examined only a few of those summoned by prosecutors during 
the hearing.

But they pointedly raised the issue of Holmes’ sanity at 
strategic moments, possibly foreshadowing a defense that some believe is
his best hope to avoid the death penalty.

'You’re aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?' defense attorney Daniel King asked one witness.

The
preliminary hearing, which ended Wednesday, was designed to determine 
whether prosecutors’ case is strong enough to put Holmes on trial.

Holmes’
lawyers haven’t said if he will plead not guilty by reason of insanity,
but since his arrest outside the theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora
immediately after the shootings, they have portrayed him as a man with 
serious mental problems prone to bizarre behavior.

Many legal analysts have said they expect the case to end with a plea bargain rather than a trial.

Tom
Teves, whose son Alex was among the dead, said he would rather see 
Holmes plead guilty to first-degree murder, avoiding a traumatic trial, 
bringing a life sentence and closing the door to an insanity defense.

If found not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes could conceivably be released someday if he is deemed to have recovered.

'Don’t pretend he’s crazy,' Mr Teves said Wednesday. 'He’s not crazy. He’s no more crazy than you and I.'

Prosecutors developed twin themes at the hearing: the horror and devastation of the attack, and a weeks' long process in which they alleged Holmes planned and prepared for the assault.

Two officers were overcome by emotion when they testified about the chaos in the theater and the race to get victims to hospitals by police cars until ambulances could arrive. Other testimony included the names and injuries of the victims, read out one by one.

Prosecution witnesses also testified that Holmes started assembling an arsenal in early May and by July 6 had two semi-automatic pistols, a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle, 6,200 rounds of ammunition and high-capacity magazines that allow a shooter to fire more rounds without stopping to reload.

In late June he began equipping himself with a helmet, gas mask and body armor, the witnesses said.

In early July, they testified, he began buying fuses, gunpowder, chemicals and electronics to booby-trap his apartment in hopes of triggering an explosion and fire to divert police from the theater. The bombs never went off.

Also in early July, he took some interior and exterior photos of the theater, witnesses said.

'He picked the perfect venue for this crime,' prosecutor Karen Pearson said.

Caren Teves, mother of Alex and wife of Tom Teves, said she saw Holmes smile when his self-portraits were shown in court.

'He just sat in the courtroom pretty much delighted. He was smiling. He was smirking,' she said
