Hamza Aldaradreh's dominating four-goal performance against Palestine has given Jordan coach Ray Wilkins a selection dilemma ahead of his team's must-win final group match against Japan.

Man of the match Hamza became just the fourth player to score four goals in an Asian Cup match to help Jordan keep its tournament hopes alive with a 5-1 win over Palestine on Friday.

Wilkins said Hamza was just the third-choice striker when Jordan started its Asian Cup campaign, behind Odai Al Saify and Ahmad Hayel.

Palestine: Saleh; Abusalah (Al Amour 56), Al-Bahdari, Battat, Jaber; Salah, Salhi, Said, Abuhabib, Hbaisha; Al-Fawaghra (Dhahda 75) 

Goal: Hbaisha 85

Jordan: Shafi; Zahran, Khattab, Murjan (Ateyah 54), Al-Dmeiri; Mustafa, Ahmad Ali, Ahmad (Israiwah 71), Deeb; Al Saify, Hamza (Al Dawud 85)

Goals: Ahmad 33, Hamza 35, 45+2, 75, 80

'Now Hamza's given me a horrible bloody headache that I have to try and sort out,' the former England midfielder said. 'Nevertheless I'm delighted for him and I'm delighted for the lads as well.'

Jordan shares the Group D lead with three points ahead of the match between fellow leaders Japan and Iraq later Friday in Brisbane. Palestine is now eliminated after two losses.

'We lost because we didn't score in the first half or 25 minutes,' Palestine coach Ahmed Al Hassan said. 'Then (we conceded) two goals in two minutes.'

Palestine looked the more organized early in the match, but it was Jordan that made the breakthrough in the 33rd minute when midfielder Yousef Ahmad Mohammad gathered a Hamza pass in the area and sent a long, curving strike into the top corner of the net.

Hamza scored another just over a minute later when he met an Abdallah Deeb cross in front of goal and slid it inside the far post.

The striker scored his second goal in first-half stoppage time when he raced into the box and connected with a Saeed Murjan cross, volleying past Palestine goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh.

Hamza completed his hat trick in the 75th minute when he burst onto a Deeb pass and sent a low shot into the net, then brought up his fourth five minutes later by beating Saleh with a low strike from just outside the box.

'I felt the score line was a little bit heavy in our favor if I'm perfectly honest. They had a number of chances and Amer Shafi made some very good saves for us,' Jordan coach Ray Wilkins said. 'I think defensively, both sides would not have been as happy as they were offensively.'

Palestine scored its first-ever Asian Cup goal when midfielder Jaka Hbaisha converted a set piece in the 85th minute to the roars of almost 10,000 Palestine fans in Melbourne's rectangular stadium. It plays its final match of the tournament against Iraq on Tuesday in Canberra.

For Jordan, preparations will now start for its final group match against tournament favorite Japan in Melbourne.

'We play in four days' time, so immediately we get back I'll take a look at the video and we'll see the end of the Japanese game and we'll see where we go from there,' Wilkins said.

'But it's back to the drawing board because the game we face now is critical for us. We've done a good job tonight, but the next game is crucial.'

Wilkins said he hoped to have Hayel available to play against Japan after he missed Friday's match due to dehydration. Hayel experienced dizziness, nausea and vomited during a protracted attempt to submit a urine sample after Monday's 1-0 loss to Iraq in Brisbane.

'He's improved very well indeed ... we got a lot of fluid into him and it looks as though he'll be OK to train tomorrow,' he said. 'If he's not good enough, then we won't play him.'
