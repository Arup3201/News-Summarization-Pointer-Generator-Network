Officers from Greater Manchester Police, who are investigating the crash, also said a dog was killed after being hit by the car while it was being walked. The dog's owner was not injured, they say. 

Today, Levi's bereft friends paid tribute to the 15-year-old on a Facebook site launched in her memory, calling her 'a top girl'. 

Cloe Louise Gregory wrote: 'R.I.P beautiful. Will be sadly missed by so many people', while Sarah Watson added: 'Still can't believe it, R.I.P Levi sweetheart. Sleep tight xxx.'

Bethy Mathers said: 'Still can't believe you're gone. Miss you so, so much. You were such an amazing girl and we had many good times. Anyway party hard up there! Love u so much.' 

And Courtney Louise added that she was 'heartbroken', saying: 'In so much shock to find out someone so beautiful at such a young age has just passed away.'

Jade Parr said: 'Rest in paradise beautiful. I cant get my head around it, I really can't! Going to miss you. You was such a top girl, always laughing and joking about! Always knew how to cheer someone up! Such an amazing girl...'

Carla Grealey said: 'RIP my beautiful little cousin, took so young can't believe it. Your in a better place now. Party hard up there baby girl. Your going to have the best send off ever!'

And Lisa Douglas posted: 'There's just no words. I go to write and my mind goes blank.

'I'm just glad I had the privilege to know such a rum but kind hearted beautiful girl. U had the world at your feet.'

Dozens of floral tributes have also been left at the scene of the crash. 

One tribute reads: 'To my sister Levi, I love you lots. Love Cameron.'

Another says: 'To my best cousin Levi. Love you so much. Love from Becca. RIP.'

The family are still too upset to comment on the young girl's death.

Neighbours living near to the site of the crash had told how they were woken by the sound of a bang and a scream. 

A spokesman said the firefighters were initially called to reports of a car hitting a tree with people trapped inside. 

Two fire engines were then called to the scene, where firefighters had to cut casualties out of the car. All casualties were taken to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport.

Police said it was too early to confirm who was driving the car and where the 15-year-old was sat.

They also added that it was also too early to say whether seatbelts were being worn or where the group had been before the crash took place.

Nearby resident Dave Goddard, the former Lib Dem leader and a House of Lords Peer, tweeted: 'Terrible car accident last night on Dialstone Lane, Offerton.

'Our thoughts with all the families involved at this most difficult time.'
