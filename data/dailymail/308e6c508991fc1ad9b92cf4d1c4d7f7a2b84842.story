Many British youngsters are too lazy, ill-educated and lacking the work ethic to compete for jobs, business leaders said last night.

The warning came in response to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s appeal to employers to ‘give our young people a chance, and not fall back on labour from abroad’.

In a speech which evoked Gordon Brown’s ill-fated ‘British jobs for British workers’ campaign, Mr Duncan Smith said employers had a ‘responsibility to help our young people get their first foot on the jobs ladder’.

But business leaders rejected the calls – and warned that many simply lack the ‘work ethic’ and skills to compete against migrant labour.

David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a generation had been ‘failed’ by schools.

‘After 11 years of formal education, employers say they get kids coming to them who can’t write, who can’t communicate, and who don’t have that work ethic,’ he said.

‘And I think we’ve also got to face up to having a benefits system which does not incentivise that many to work.

‘So, clearly, when you have these bright young Eastern Europeans who really want to work and have very good customer service skills then employers are going to turn to them – and quite right. These businesses are competing in a globalised economy.'

Andrew Cave, of the Federation of Small Businesses,  echoed concerns about education and accused Mr Duncan Smith of making a ‘glib, throwaway political comment’.

And Neil Carberry, the CBI’s director for employment policy, said firms had to ‘choose the best person for the job’.

In addition, employment lawyers warned that any firm favouring British workers could fall foul of the Equalities Act. Downing Street said Mr Duncan Smith’s speech to a think-tank in Spain – which was anticipated in yesterday’s Daily Mail – was made in a ‘personal capacity’.

A spokesman refused to endorse the idea that  firms should give preference to British youngsters over migrants, saying it was a  ‘decision for business’.

But Number 10 insisted Mr Duncan Smith had been ‘stating government policy’ in his call for a tougher approach to immigration.

Yesterday, he highlighted figures showing that more than half of the jobs created last year went to immigrants.

He said that without action from both government and business, a new generation of youngsters would be condemned to a life on benefits.

The Work and Pensions Secretary added that they needed to work together to ensure the immigration system ‘works in the interests of Britain’ and the unemployed are given a ‘level playing field’.

His speech is likely to stoke tensions with the Liberal Democrats over immigration.

Sources close to Nick Clegg insisted he was relaxed about it, but Business Secretary Vince Cable is known to be fighting with Home Secretary Theresa May over the issue.

Mr Duncan Smith was supported by fellow Tory MPs – as well as former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, who stressed he was ‘speaking for the vast majority of people in this country’.

And Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said Mr Duncan Smith was right to stress that business had a ‘responsibility’ to help get young people working.

The work ethics of foreign workers make them better candidates for jobs than many British workers

Needs to be 'an immigration system that gives the unemployed a level playing field'

But Chambers of Commerce boss counters: 'They expect young [British] people to come forward to them who are able to read, to write, to be able to communicate and have a strong work ethic. Too often that is not the case'
