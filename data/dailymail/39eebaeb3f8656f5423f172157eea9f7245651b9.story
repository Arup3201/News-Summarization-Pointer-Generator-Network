Ed Balls was forced to unveil a series of changes to Labour’s mansion tax plan yesterday – including a charge of £3,000 a year on homes worth up to £3million.

The Shadow Chancellor’s announcement of the controversial levy on homes worth £2million or more was the centrepiece of the Labour conference – with the money earmarked for the NHS.

But it has been attacked by senior Labour figures, who say it will penalise pensioners who live in houses that happen to have soared in value, and the Tories said yesterday that the plans were ‘unravelling’.

Labour;'s shadow chancellor Ed Balls today promised people earning less than £42,000-a-year will be able to defer paying the mansion tax

Yesterday Mr Balls said he had decided that people with an income of less than £42,000 would be able to defer payment until they sell up or die.

He also revealed that Labour’s mansion tax will cost about £250 a month for someone in a home worth between £2million and £3million. 

This adds up to a maximum £3,000 a year – £500 above the average council tax bill for properties in top rated Band H. Home owners would pay mansion tax on top of council tax.

Mr Balls also said foreign owners with second homes in the UK could be forced to pay ‘a larger contribution’ than people living in their only home.

Thousands of London homes could be hit by the plan to impose the levy on properties worth more than £2million

Writing in the London Evening Standard, Mr Balls addressed concerns that ‘cash poor, asset rich’ households would suffer.

‘Ordinary Londoners should be protected and wealthy foreign investors must finally make a proper tax contribution in this country,’ he said.

The tax would be ‘fair, sensible and proportionate’, he claimed, adding: ‘We will ensure those owning properties worth £2-3million will only pay an extra £250 a month. 

Owners and investors in properties worth tens of millions of pounds should make a much bigger contribution.’

Responding to the charge that poorer pensioners in expensive properties would be hit, he vowed that ‘long-standing residents’ on less than the higher rate of income tax — that is, less than £42,000 a year — would have a right to defer the charge ‘until the property changes hands’.

Mr Balls also addressed concerns that rapidly rising property prices in London would see ever-more households sucked into the tax. 

He said the threshold would rise in line with the average prices of homes costing £2million and more, rather than in line with average house prices.

‘We will guarantee that more modest properties are not brought into the tax,’ he said.

It is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax.

James Browne of the Institute for Fiscal Studies offered the Shadow Chancellor some support, saying it was ‘perfectly possible’ that the proposals would raise the £1.2billion that Mr Balls wanted for the NHS. But he said it would mean people with a home worth £3million and above having to pay ‘substantially’ more.

Priti Patel, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said Labour’s plans were in chaos.

‘Labour’s NHS promise has unravelled,’ he said. ‘This panicked change in policy shows Ed Miliband and Ed Balls’s homes tax won’t raise the money they say it will. 

'You can’t protect the NHS if you can’t make the sums add up and bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time.

‘The only way to secure the future of our NHS is to stick to our long-term economic plan.’
