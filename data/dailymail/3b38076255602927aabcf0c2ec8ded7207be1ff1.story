Miranda Hart's height has caused her TV character no end of trouble – even earning her the nickname Queen Kong.

But one disgruntled viewer has complained to the BBC that Miss Hart's sitcom ridicules tall women ... despite the fact that it is written by its 6ft star.

The bizarre comment was revealed by the BBC Trust in a report containing some of the oddest complaints it received last year.

The BBC has been accused of showing bias against tall women - such as six-foot tall Miranda Hart - and promoting a 'gay agenda'

 One complaint to the BBC accused the corporation of unfairly ridiculing tall women in its programmes

Agenda? Three complaints were made against BBC One show Doctor Who, accusing it of 'promoting homosexuality'

Three concerned the family favourite Doctor Who, accusing it of 'promoting homosexuality'. Peter Capaldi's Doctor and his assistant, played by Jenna Coleman, are occasionally joined on their adventures by a lesbian lizard-woman, Madame Vastra, and her human wife Jenny.

Others were concerned by the lack of happy marriages in other BBC dramas, while Americanisms, poor grammar and the use of metric instead of imperial measurements also raised the audience's ire.

The return of Jonathan Ross to Radio 2, six years after the Sachsgate affair, prompted ten complaints – while on Radio 4, The Archers was deemed too 'unrealistic'. 

Even The Great British Bake Off was condemned, for an inappropriate use of the Hallelujah Chorus, while the stars of Last Tango in Halifax were castigated for taking their eyes off the road while driving.

Some perceived 'religious bias' in BBC sports coverage which showed footballers crossing themselves. 

Others took issue with Match of the Day's alleged preferential treatment of Manchester United – with the programme also accused of being anti-Stoke City.

A 'lesbian' encounter between a lizard and a woman in Doctor Who was broadcast earlier this year

Misery: Popular soap EastEnders was in the firing line by viewers who complained about it having 'man-eating characters'

Peter Jones should not have called an entrepreneur a 'numpty' on Dragons' Den, one complainant said

A further complaint was lodged against the show by a viewer who thought it should not have aired footage of a supporter falling over. 

Concerning strong language, one Dragons' Den fan was moved to write in after Peter Jones mocked an entrepreneur – by calling him a 'numpty'. 

Of the 13,688 complaints made to the BBC between last February and this September, 12,000 were serious enough to go through a formal internal process – but hundreds were dismissed at an early stage. 

The trust said this occurred when there was a lack of evidence – or the complaint in question was deemed too trivial.

A BBC spokesman said: 'The complaints framework that the BBC Trust put in place in 2012 allows the BBC to close down, after an initial response, complaints that for example are hypothetical, use abusive language, fail to cite any evidence or breaches of the BBC's editorial guidelines.

'Only about 10 per cent of complaints fall into this category and if complainants are unhappy they can appeal to the BBC Trust.'
