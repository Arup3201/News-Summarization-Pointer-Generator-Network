Having set a date for her big day, Claire Donnelly was delighted to be able to get down to the business of choosing her wedding dress.

So the 31-year-old booked an appointment at boutique bridal shop By Design in Gloucester

But Miss Donnelly  was left devastated after shop workers reportedly told her she was too big to be fitted for a gown.

She says she was left feeling humiliated after an assistant told her the shop did not stock dresses big enough for her size 16 figure.

Too fat? Bride-to-be Claire Donnelly, size 16, says she was distraught to be told there was nothing big enough - or that she could afford on her £450 budget - in Gloucester bridal boutique By Design

Claire, who is 5ft 2ins, was then told that she would not be able to afford any of the designs in the shop with her budget of £450 to £500.

The retail assistant, who lives in Gloucester, said: 'The assistant took one look at me and said there was nothing there that would fit me.

'She asked what my budget was and said there was nothing there I could afford. I was taken aback by her attitude.

'I was trying to find one super dress for one super day and I just felt completely deflated. I was so upset and just wanted to go home.'

Unhappy: Claire claims that the boutique told her she was too big for any of their dresses - but manager Tim has hit back, saying they were never rude, and tried to accommodate Claire the best they could

The average UK woman has measurements of 39-34-41, putting them into a size of either 14 or 16.

Claire, who is due to get married next August, is now calling for dress shops to accommodate all shapes and sizes to avoid embarrassments for brides-to-be.

Tim Shayle, manager at By Design, said their dress prices start from around £500 - with additional costs for alterations and fittings, and that on the day Claire came into the boutique, she said she had a budget of £450 to £500. 

But he insisted that he always tries to accommodate brides and their budgets, whatever they may be, to help them get a deal that allows them to have the style they want.

He said: 'This is a difficult subject and we try to handle these situations as sensitively as possible.

'We are only a small boutique shop and it is a business decision to only stock certain sizes for people to try on.

'We only carry a certain amount of stock so we are limited to the sizes we have.

Economies of scale: Bridal boutique By Design said they don't carry samples in a size zero either. 'It's a commercial decision,' manager Tim said. 'We stock the samples we get asked for most. We simply don't have space to keep everything in store'

'Wedding dresses have to be perfect, but in order to help the customer as best we can we need to know what they can afford.'

'We
 were never rude. Claire did try on dresses in the shop but unfortunately 
they were not her size.

'We do the very best we can but sometimes you 
just don't have the stock. You can't please all of the people all of the
 time. It is very unfair for Claire to vilify us for not having what she wanted.

'You wouldn't go to Long Tall Sally and ask for a size 10 in a regular length and get upset if they didn't have it.

'It's
 a purely commercial decision to stock the range of sizes we do, and down to economies of scale. Any 
clothing retailer would tell you what their specific market is. We are the same.

'We
 don't stock size zero dresses either. Not because we have anything 
against petite people, we just don't get asked for it enough.

'We are not a department store': The Gloucester boutique says they do their best to help all brides, but that they are limited by space and cost

'The
 dresses are available throughout all sizes, but we only have a certain 
amount of space in the store to stock samples available for our 
customers. 

'You have to stock the sample dresses which we are most likely to sell.

'In six years of trading we know the majority of our customers want a size 8 to 14.

'We go no lower than 8 in our samples or higher than 14 - but we've made both smaller and larger sizes to order.

'We do our best to keep our customers happy. Without customers we don't have a business, after all.

'Miss Donnelly could absolutely have asked for any of our samples in a size 16 or 18, but we do have to consider budget.

'Hers was £450 to £500. We try not to restrict people, and we attempt to accommodate all budgets.

'We do our best to come to a deal they can afford and give them the style that they want.'
