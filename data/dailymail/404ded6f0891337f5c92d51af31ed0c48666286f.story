Playfully nuzzling up to the camera and warmly embracing a team of divers, these cute seal pups appear more like household pets as they frolic in the North Sea.

The seals, believed to be around two months old, were unperturbed by the divers and their cameras as they butt their noses against the camera lens and enjoy having their bellies tickled.

The adorable pups were captured on camera by scuba diver Jason Neilus as he and his friends took to the chilly waters off the Farne Islands in Northumberland.

'We’ve been visiting here for the last six years to say hello to the seal pups and we’ve never had this much interaction before,' he wrote on his Vimeo blog. 

'They were everywhere and all over us.'

The seals were filmed in October last year, just before the St Jude's Storm battered Britain and much of northern Europe.

'After a nightmare drive there with the worst traffic coupled with the 
imminent arrival of the St. Jude storm we didn’t think this trip was 
going to be worth the effort but once again the seals made every second 
worthwhile,' said Mr Neilus.

Filmed without lights, so as not to upset the young seal pups, the clip captures the curious creatures as they play in their natural habitat - cosying up to the divers without a care in the world.

In the videom which has been viewed 123,000 times on Vimeo, one pup even swims into one for its new friends for a quick cuddle, while others dart across the sea bed, pausing to cheekily nibble the divers' fingers.

Mr Neilus was quick to point out that as wild animals the seals chose to interact with the divers, and were not forced to interact with the group. None of the seals were harmed by diver interaction.

The seals were around two months old at the time they were filmed, but had already grown to two metres long, and weighed around 200 to 300lbs.

Once the pups reach adulthood the majority of them will move away to form new colonies, and are unlikely to even see humans again.

'As always once the seals get older and move off to form colonies of their own elsewhere and the majority of them will not see people again

'Fully adult seals are rarely this interactive and whilst tolerant of divers they tend to keep away after their first year of diver visits,' said Mr Neilus.
