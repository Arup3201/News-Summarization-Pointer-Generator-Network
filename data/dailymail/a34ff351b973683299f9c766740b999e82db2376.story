Among a rapidly dwindling band, no one epitomises the courage and heroism of the Bomber Command veterans more than Freddie 'Johnny' Johnson.

A survivor of 92 missions during five years of service in the Second World War, the highly decorated rear gunner was shot down twice – once behind enemy lines – but lived to fight another day.

Now aged 91 and a wheelchair user, he could have expected to be a VIP guest at the unveiling of a long-awaited £6.5million Bomber Command memorial in Green Park in central London.

But despite his distinguished service 
and years of work helping to raise money for the memorial appeal, Mr 
Johnson has been told he cannot attend the ceremony on June 28 because 
there are no tickets left.

The memorial, a sculpture which features seven bomber air crew members, is expected to be unveiled by the Queen.

It is seen as overdue recognition for 
the bomber crews whose place in history has been widely played down 
because of the high number of civilian deaths they caused.

Mr Johnson's family are furious about 
the snub. They found out too late that veterans had to apply for 
tickets, like anyone else wanting to attend.

Now the entire allocation has been 
taken up, largely by relatives of those who served on the bombers, and 
Mr Johnson has been told he can't go.

His daughter Mandy Stewart, 56, said: 'How can they expect a 91-year-old war veteran to sort this out himself?

'He's a member of the RAF Association so it couldn't have been that hard to trace him and invite him to the ceremony.

'We feel that precedence should be given to those who were actually there.'

Mr Johnson, of Tadcaster, North 
Yorkshire, supported numerous fundraising events over the years which 
finally led to the memorial being given the go ahead.

He said: 'I would have loved to have gone. I was very pleased when I heard it was being built.'

Like many other veterans he was determined that the 55,573 bomber crew who lost their lives should be given a fitting memorial.

Mr Johnson was 20 when he joined the 
RAF. As a rear gunner he had a life expectancy of six weeks, but went on
to survive the entire war and earn six medals, including the 
Distinguished Flying Cross, in the process.

There were 25 missions over Germany, as well as stints in Burma and North Africa in Wellington and Halifax bombers.

Mr Johnson's closest shave came at El 
Alamein in 1942 when his plane was shot down. He survived by a stroke of
luck when the turret of his plane where he was sitting came away as the
aircraft crashed into the desert. The front end of the plane exploded, 
killing four men on board, but he survived.

Despite being behind enemy lines he 
marched off into the desert  and was picked up by a group of British 
soldiers who had spotted the crash.

A second crash occurred when his plane
was shot down near the Burma border, and on this occasion everyone 
survived.

The rear gunner badly damaged his leg in another operation and
was in hospital when his medal and letter from the King arrived. He 
still has pins in his legs and suffers severe arthritis.

He remains fiercely proud of his war years and his wife Jean, 85, believes the authorities have let him down.

She said: 'It's a shame. He is 
bitterly disappointed. There can't be that many veterans left who saw 
such long service and were presented with so many medals. This memorial 
is what my husband has been waiting for. At one point in the war the 
bombers were all we had. The bombers deserve this.'

The memorial organisers said that they
were extremely sorry that Mr Johnson and other veterans had been unable
to get tickets to the event.

A spokesman said: 'The problem is we 
have been absolutely overwhelmed by demand for tickets. We have a 
licence limiting us to 6,500 guests which we cannot exceed, and have 
prioritised two groups – people who lost relatives such as husbands and 
fathers, and veterans who flew in the planes.

'But we still probably have at least 
1,000 people who would like to attend but cannot come. Other events will
be staged at the memorial later in the year and we would hope that 
people who cannot get a ticket this time will be able to attend one of 
those functions.'
