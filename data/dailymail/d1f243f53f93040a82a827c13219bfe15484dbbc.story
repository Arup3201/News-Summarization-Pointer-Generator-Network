Savaged: John Paul Massey was killed by his uncle's pitbull

Police ignored reports that illegal dogs were being bred in a house where a four-year-old boy was killed by a pitbull, a damning report has revealed.

Despite a senior housing officer telling officers that the uncle of little John Paul Massey was breeding illegal dogs in the same property where the youngster was mauled to death, police did nothing.

Watchdog bosses have now rapped officers from Merseyside Police for failing to act in the nine months before the child's death.

John Paul Massey was savaged by his uncle Christian Foulke's pitbull, Uno, while he was at his grandmother's home in November 2009.

The little boy suffered appalling injuries to his head and neck after being shaken like a 'rag doll' by the dog.

Foulkes, then aged 22, admitted owning the animal and was jailed for four months last June.

A report into the incident centres on officers choosing to reject an earlier report that Foulkes was nurturing illegal dogs at a house in Wavertree, Liverpool, where his mother Helen lived.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission described the force's reaction to the initial report a 'inadequate', highlighting a catalogue of errors.

Key findings in the report include how:

Two police officers - an acting sergeant and a PC - as well as a member of the police communication staff were given 'management advice' for the inadequate handling of the report following the inquiry.

Naseem Malik, IPCC commissioner for the north west, said: 'We will never know with any certainty what might have happened if a different decision had been taken by the officers and staff in February 2009.

'With hindsight it is easy to say that had the police responded differently the dangerous dog may have been seized and John Paul Massey would not have died.

'However hindsight is a wonderful thing. We cannot know for certain what would have happened.'

She added: 'What is a terribly sad certainty is that in November 2009 a young, innocent boy lost his life.

'I read the emotional tributes paid to John Paul after his death - he was clearly a well-loved little boy.

'He was too young to know the potential risk posed by that dog. The tragedy is others either were aware, or should have been aware, of the potential risk and they will have to live with that knowledge.'

Merseyside Police introduced a dangerous dogs policy following the death of Ellie Lawrenson in St Helens in 2007, which was recognised for good practice by the Association of Chief Police Officers.

However, failings in the John Paul Massey case 'undermined' the good work achieved previously.

Illegal: Pitbulls are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act

Ms Malik ruled: 'An opportunity was clearly missed which may have resulted in further investigation.

'However this was not due to malice or any deliberate act. Rather it was poor decision making on behalf of the officers and staff involved.

'The officers and staff - the acting Sergeant, the PC who requested the log be closed and the communications room supervisor who closed the log - have been subject to action plans.'

Chief Superintendent John Young, from Merseyside Police's Force's Professional Standards Department, said: 'Following the death of John Paul Massey we made a voluntary referral to the IPCC after the investigation discovered that information about potential illegal dog breeding at an address had not been dealt with adequately.

'This information was received by a police call handler nine months before a dog owned by John Paul's uncle and looked after by his grandmother, killed John Paul.

'However, on this occasion appropriate action was not taken. All recommendations made by the IPCC have been implemented.'
