A 14-year-old girl was repeatedly raped at a drug den by a gang of men who treated her with 'indignity and contempt', a jury has heard.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to the house in Brierfield, Lancashire, and allegedly passed around for their sexual gratification.

The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service.

He befriended the girl when she was 12 or 13 and frequently took her for drives in his cars, it is alleged.

Prosecutor Alaric Bassano told Burnley Crown Court: 'It was him who took her on many occasions to the house and him who assisted, encouraged and incited others to rape and sexually assault this girl.

'On one occasion, he raped the girl himself. Over a period of time he subdued her will and coerced her into submission.'

He said three other men raped her and one man subjected her to a sexual assault.

The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated.

She could be aggressive, disobedient towards her mother, refusing to go to school and staying out late at night, he added.

The girl told police that her mobile telephone number was given to Imran Amjad, known to her as 'Immy', by another, and he called to ask to meet up.

Three of the defendants are seen leaving Burnley Crown Court yesterday. The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated

She first met up with him when she was aged 13 and was driven around the streets of Burnley in his car every few days, she said.

Her mother became concerned she spent so much time in his company and confronted him.

Mr Bassano said the defendant’s response typified his 'arrogance', which he said would emerge in the trial.

He said: 'When she told him about her age, and when she advanced her accusation that he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with her, he simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away.

'It is to be noted that he did not deny the allegation.'

Her mother contacted the police in 
December 2009 to report her concerns about her daughter’s welfare at the
hands of 'Immy', he said.

Mr Bassano said the girl made no complaint at the time and continued to mix with Immy who, undeterred, went on to commit the numerous offences against her in 2010.

All six defendants are from Brierfield.

Imran Amjad denies abducting a child, rape, engaging in sexual activity with a child, aiding and abetting rape, and witness intimidation.

He is also accused of intentionally encouraging or assisting the rape of the girl by a man known as 'Saj'.

The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service. Above, four of the defendants pictured yesterday

Haroon Mahmood, 22, denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child.

Mohammed Zishan Amjad, 24, also denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child.

Mohammed Suleman Farooq, 22, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation.

Shiraz Afzal, 25, and Omar Mazafar, 21, both deny aiding and abetting rape.

All the sexual offences are said to have been committed between April and October 2010.

In summary, Mr Bassano said: 'This case concerns the sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old girl. A number of men were involved in this abuse which involved planning and, on occasions, offenders acting together.

'The girl was groomed over a period of time and on many occasions she was taken to a house in Brierfield.

'That house was used as a den at which young men attended and brought or invited girls and young women in order to drink alcohol, take drugs and engage in sex.

'It was to this house that the girl was taken and at this house where she was sexually assaulted and raped by several adult males.

'During these times the girl was being passed between the men to be used for their own sexual gratification. The Crown contends that this girl was treated with indignity and contempt by them.

'All six defendants were involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in this sexual abuse.'

The trial, expected to last six weeks, continues.
