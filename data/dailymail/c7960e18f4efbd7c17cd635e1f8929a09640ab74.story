Everton’s South African midfielder Steven Pienaar has admitted the death of his team-mate Senzo Meyiwa is ‘difficult to understand’.

Meyiwa, 27, was gunned down as he tried to protect his pop-star girlfriend Kelly Khumalo after masked raiders broke into her house late on Sunday night.

Pienaar said on Everton’s website: ‘I want to express my sincere sympathy to Senzo’s family and friends at this very sad time. To lose your life at a young age when you have so much ahead of you is tragic and very difficult to understand. 

Everton's Steven Pienaar said the death of Senzo Meyiwa was both tragic and difficult to understand

The goalkeeper last played for his club on the Saturday evening and had recently captained his country

'Senzo was a very talented goalkeeper who was well-liked by team-mates and opponents alike. Our nation has lost a popular sportsman and he will be missed.’

South Africa will decide later this week whether to call off next month’s African Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan.

South African president Jacob Zuma led the grieving yesterday saying: ‘Words cannot express the nation’s shock at this loss.’ He added that the police would ‘leave no stone unturned in finding his killers’.

This weekend’s derby between Meyiwa’s club side Orlando Pirates and their Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs has already been called off as a mark of respect.
