Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball bat

A pregnant woman who was beaten to death by her boyfriend who assaulted with a baseball bat has died, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. 

Police say 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco, who was originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning after being violently assaulted at her trailer park home in Delaware. 

Miss Polanco was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries.

Before she died, she gave birth to a baby girl who was born three months premature.

The newborn is listed in critical but stable condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware.

Police were called to the home in the Waterford Trailer Park after paramedics found the woman unconscious inside the home.

Investigators claim Paula's injuries were caused  by 24-year-old Fernando Flores who assaulted her.

Flores was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter.

He is now in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution awaiting trial.

Paola's family in Puente de Camotlan in Mexico are hoping that people may be able to donate to help bring her body back to her home country.

They have set up a page which they also hope will help to raise some funds to help care for her  newborn baby girl which the family will now look after. 

So far the page has raised $1,095.

The fundraising page reads: 'Paola Eden Delagado Polanco was a young thriving girl and full of life, with charming simplicity and humility. 

'She died October 29 at her 21 years as a victim of domestic violence. Paola was six months pregnant, and by a miracle the baby survived. God has plans for all of us and Paola is now in the kingdom of heaven with our Heavenly Father. 

She was beautiful, but her inner beauty was far more radiant than her physical attractiveness. 

'We urge support for funeral expenses and to send her body to rest in her home town of Puente de Camotlan Nayarit, Mexico. We also ask for your help in the expenses for her premature baby girl who has a long journey ahead of her. Thank you and may God bless you.'
