Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker has defended his decision to join the R's over Crystal Palace, despite being mired in a second successive relegation battle. 

The 23-year-old left Cardiff when they dropped out of the top flight last season, and held talks with both Palace and QPR before making the decision to move to west London.

Caulker, who has played 26 times in the Premier League this season, says that Rio Ferdinand was a major factor in his decision to sign for QPR.

The 23-year-old says that Rio Ferdinand was a huge influence in his decision to sign for the R's

'There were talks with Palace, but I spoke to Rio (Ferdinand) before I came, and QPR was a club I watched growing up as a kid,' the one-time England international told GetWestLondon.

'The influence of Rio and Richard Dunne, two good centre halves, made me think I could learn from them.'

Caulker will travel south of the river to face Palace on Saturday, in his first visit to Selhurst Park since opting against joining them.

Chris Ramsey's side are desperate for points, having been cut three points adrift after seven losses in their last eight games.

Palace, on the other hand, are in good form under Alan Pardew, and will look to continue their push towards safety with another three points.
