With six grandchildren of her own, among them the third in line to the throne, the Duchess of Cornwall is no stranger to the demands of small children.

And she had ample opportunity to show off her childcare skills when a young well-wisher's hat was blown off in front of her during a walkabout in Rutland.

Her face wreathed in smiles, the Duchess swiftly picked up the pink hat and tried to put it back on the little girl's head - much to her displeasure and her mother's delight.

After three attempts, the Duchess chuckled ruefully and handed the garment to the toddler's mother before rushing to catch up with Prince Charles who was saying hello to another well-wisher.

The royal couple were in the quaint market town of Oakham in the Midlands county to tour the St John and St Anne Almshouse, which provides a home for local retirees.

Prince Charles is patron of the Almshouse Association and during the visit, met some of the residents as well as unveiling a commemorative plaque.

Afterwards, the two were driven into Oakham where they met local well-wishers, among them the hat-averse toddler, before stopping for a beer and touring the market.

Camilla, who was elegant in a cream jacket and patterned skirt, certainly seemed to enjoy hers - although perhaps not as much as Prince Charles who smiled broadly as he sipped his half pint.

Also giving the famously eco-conscious royal a reason to smile were the market stalls, which included several that showcased sustainable production methods - among them Northfield Farm, which runs a herd of rare breed Dexter Cattle on its land, and Rutland Biodynamics.

Later, a troupe of Morris Dancers arrived to give a performance before a detour to Oakham Castle allowed the Duchess to take part in a local custom: presenting a floral horseshoe to the Lord of the Manor.

According to tradition, any peer of the realm or senior member of the royal family visiting Oakham for the first time should present the Lord of the Manor, currently Jos Hanbury, with a horseshoe.

Along with the decorative version presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, the collection at Oakham Castle includes one said to have been given by Edward IV 
around 1470.

More recent additions to the hoard include ones given by the 
Princess Royal in 1999, the Prince of Wales in 2003 and Princess
 Alexandra in 2005.

Customs satisfied, the couple were driven to the final stop on their tour, Rutland Water nature reserve.

There, Charles was given the chance to show off his own childcare skills as he met youngsters taking part in the recently launched Walk a Country Mile scheme, which aims to raise funds for hard-hit rural communities.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are currently in the middle of a busy series of engagements that began with their annual 'Wales Week' at the beginning of July.

Other stops on their itinerary have included Devon and Cornwall, Wiltshire and, most recently, a visit to Glasgow to meet athletes as the Commonwealth Games kicked off.
