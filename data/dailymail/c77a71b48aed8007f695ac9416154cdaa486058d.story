A major Ebola outbreak may have gone unreported in a remote region of Sierra Leone, according to the the World Health Organization (WHO), whose officials found scores of bodies piled up in a hospital earlier this week. 

'They uncovered a grim scene,' the UN health agency said in statement after making the discovery  in the remote diamond-mining region of Kono. 'In 11 days, two teams buried 87 bodies.'

Among the dead were a nurse, ambulance driver and janitor who had previously been drafted in to remove bodies as they piled up, they added.  

Officials from the World Health Organisation fear another outbreak of the Ebola Virus in the remote Kono region of Sierra Leone. Health workers discovered scores of bodies piled up at the region's only hospital

The Kono region has now been on lockdown by the Sierra Leone government as it bids to battle the disease. The district had reported 119 cases among its 350,000 inhabitants before December 9 but officials fear the numbers will be far worse

The area has now been put on a two-week lockdown by the country's government.

'Our team met heroic doctors and nurses at their wits end, exhausted burial teams and lab techs, all doing the best they could, but they simply ran out of resources and were overrun with gravely ill people,' said Dr. Olu Olushayo, an official in WHO's response Ebola team. 

Officially the Kono district had reported 119 cases among its 350,000 inhabitants before December 9, but some have expressed concern that the figures have massively underrepresented the size of the outbreak in the region. 

In just five days leading up to the WHO team's arrival, 25 people died in a makeshift, cordoned-off section in the area's only hospital. 

Bodies are a frightening source of contagion as the devastating virus carries its heaviest load right after death. 

WHO officials also discovered that villages scattered across eight of the area's 15 chiefdoms had also been hit by the disease.

'We are only seeing the ears of the hippo,' said Dr. Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone's Director of Disease Prevention and Control, using a local proverb equated to 'the tip of the iceberg.'

Sierra Leone authorities said they ordered a two-week 'lockdown' in the region until December 23, in hope of containing transmission of the virus. 

While people will be able to move within the Kono region, officials said no one will be allowed to leave.  

The West African nation recently overtook neighbouring Liberia for the highest number of Ebola cases, recording 7,897 since the epidemic was first identified earlier this year. 

'For tireless acts of courage and mercy,' Time announced Ebola fighters as their 'Person of the Year 2014'  

However, Liberia has registered 3,177 deaths, considerably more than the 1,768 marked in Sierra Leone, raising concerns that many fatalities have not been reflected in the figures. 

Quoted by WHO, the country's health minister Abu Bakarr said it was difficult to put an exact figure on the death toll, explaining that his country was only counting deaths from laboratory confirmed Ebola cases. 

'They are adding suspected cases, so that is causing the discrepancies in the results. We are going by the textbook,' he said. 

The current Ebola epidemic is the worst on record and has killed 6,388 people out of 17,942 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone according to WHO data.

The death toll continues to grow, fuelled principally by new infections in Sierra Leone. 

News of the latest outbreak comes just days after medics battling the disease were recognized as Time magazine's Person of the Year 

Announcing the prestigious title , editor Nancy Gibbs said: 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight.'
