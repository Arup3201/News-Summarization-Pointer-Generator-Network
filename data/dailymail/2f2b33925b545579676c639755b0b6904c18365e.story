Prime Minister’s Questions should be shown live on TV in a prime time slot, Nick Clegg has claimed as he railed against the ‘ridiculous’ spectacle of MPs hollering at each other each week.

The Lib Dem leader said voters should be able to send in questions to be answered by the Prime Minister as he called for an end to the ban on MPs calling each other by their names.

In an extraordinary attack on parliamentary tradition, Mr Clegg condemned the ‘highly aggressive, macho, chest‑beating, testosterone‑driven’ charade which is deeply off‑putting to the public.

Mr Clegg warned that each failure to change the way Parliament is run, including party funding and electing the House of Lords, is ‘another nail in the coffin of public interest in participation in politics’.

Senior politicians have repeatedly tried to alter the way the Commons is run, with David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband all vowing soon after becoming leader to change the culture of Prime Minister’s Questions.

But attempts to end the heckling and insults rarely last long, despite repeated warnings that the public are put off by it.

Asked what he would like to change about the Commons’ culture, Mr Clegg replied: ‘Pretty well everything. I just despair sometimes about just how totally out of step with modern life politics generally appears and, certainly, in the House of Commons.’

Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband go head-to-head at noon every Wednesday, meaning few people who work ever watch the clashes live.

Mr Clegg backed a Mumsnet petition calling for PMQs to be overhauled and made more accessible.

‘I think it’s brilliant… basically saying, ‘When is Prime Minister’s Questions is going to be, a) scheduled to the time when people below the 65 watch it? When is it actually going to allow other people to ask questions?

‘When is it going to become less of this kind of Punch and Judy formula?’

The Deputy Prime Minister said he had tried - and failed - to make changes to the House of Lords and party funding

Mr Clegg told a Q&A with Mumsnet: ‘It’s just ridiculous. You can’t even call people by their name. You can’t even address people like human beings.

‘And so the whole thing is in a language which wasn’t used since 1867 and in a kind of highly aggressive, sort of, macho, chest‑beating, testosterone‑driven idiom which is deeply off‑putting to – to any normal person.’

Under Commons rules, MPs cannot refer to each other by name, but their constituency.

It means Mr Clegg is known as ‘the Right Honorable member for Sheffield Hallam’.

MPs must also speak through the chair, so instead of telling an opponent ‘you are wrong’, they must say ‘he is wrong’.

MailOnline last year revealed details of letters sent to Commons Speaker John Bercow about behaviour at PMQs.

MPs were branded them ‘morons’, ‘t**ts’, ‘braying donkeys’ and a throwback to the 19th century.

MailOnline last year revealed details of letters sent to Commons Speaker John Bercow about behaviour at PMQs, branding MPs 'morons’, ‘t**ts’, ‘braying donkeys’ and a throwback to the 19th century.

Mr Clegg said he had tried – and failed- to modernise Parliament. ‘I couldn’t even manage to persuade the powers that be to introduce a smidgen of democracy into the House of Lords or even change the rules by which parties were funded.

‘My own view is that every time the Westminster establishment fails to reform itself, whether it’s on how Prime Minister [Questions are] conducted, how parties are funded, whether you let voters in to decide who’s in the House of Lords… every time they do that, there is just another nail in the coffin of public interest in participation in politics.’

He said the failure to back change will ‘only make the later crises – which will come – in public confidence in politics all the worse.’

Meanwhile, Commons Speaker John Bercow last night urged MPs to complete the 'revolution' in Parliament triggered by the expenses scandal five years ago.

In a speech at Westminster, Mr Bercow said that reforms passed after the public outcry over MPs' expense claims had had a 'transformative' effect on the work of the House.

He highlighted in particular select committees, which had adopted a more confident, 'gladiatorial' approach since their members were elected in a secret ballot of party colleagues, with the chairmen elected by the whole House, rather than chosen by party whips.

He suggested they should go further, extending the system of 'confirmation' hearings for important public appointments, following up their reports more vigorously and employing in-house researchers.
