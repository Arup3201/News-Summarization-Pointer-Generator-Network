A religious fanatic who thought he was Madonna's son and called himself Jesus was jailed 11 years after brutally murdering his wheelchair-bound mother.

Trevor Rush, now 33, insisted that his horrific killing of 57-year-old Dorothy was 'God's work' after he stabbed the multiple sclerosis sufferer to death in May 2001.

Rush murdered his mother and injured his father in a frenzied attack with a mallet and kitchen knife at their home in Norwich.

He has been held in a secure psychiatric clinic in the city since the savage killing, after being declared too mentally ill to plead to any charges at the time.

The then 22-year-old believed he was the son of pop star Madonna and told police at the murder scene his name was Jesus Christ and Jesus Ciccone.

He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and unlawful wounding at Norwich Crown Court on Thursday.

Rush was made the subject of an indefinite hospital order and taken straight back to the Norvic clinic.

The frenzied attack on both his parents took place at their home in Norwich on May 6, 2001.

Rush used a mallet and a kitchen knife to inflict deep neck wounds on his mother and seriously injured his father John as the 58-year-old desperately tried to save his wife's life.

Mr Rush then went to call for help from his neighbour as the brutal assault continued, leaving his deranged son standing over his mother with the mallet.

Shocked police found Mrs Rush lying dead while her blood-soaked son appeared totally calm.

Rush told police: 'I struck him [his father] until he repented, but the witch wouldn't so I killed her.

'I was doing God's work and I will put my faith in God.'

He gave his name as Jesus Christ and Jesus Ciccone, the surname of pop star Madonna.

Rush told officers to take him to a church before the police station so he could thank God for helping him.

At a trial in 2002, John Rush said he had begun to worry about his son and had planned to visit his GP two days after the tragedy.

Mr Rush said his son became very withdrawn after dropping out of university halfway through an engineering degree and had refused to look for work.

The murder took place after Rush slapped his mother, a regular church-goer and former foster parent.

He then flew into a rage and turned on his father when he tried to call police.

Rush accused his father of being in collusion with Government spies and police and plotting his murder before calling his mother 'the whore of the devil'.

His delusions are thought to have started around Christmas 2000.

Rush grew a beard and long hair and began believing that Madonna was his mother and his real parents had fostered him.
