What if you could send secret messages to someone just by touching them?

Disney has created a ‘magical’ device that allows you to do just that using a simple microphone and the human body.

The Ishin-Den-Shin technology, which roughly translates into telepathy in Japanese, turns the body into a human speaker allowing anyone to transmit messages through their fingertips.

When a person whisper’s into the Ishin-Den-Shin microphone, sound energy is converted into electrical energy creating an electrostatic field around the whisper’s body.

The whisper can then touch another individual on their earlobe and the electrostatic field will send vibrations through the ear.

This causes the person touched, but no one else, to hear the message that was whispered.

Ivan Poupyrev, one of the inventors 
of the system, explained that the inaudible signal can be transmitted 
from body to body, using any type of physical contact.

‘The Ishin-Den-Shin system includes a handheld microphone connected to a computer’s sound card.’ He said.

‘When someone speaks into the microphone, the computer turns the sound into a looped recording.

‘The recording is then converted into high-voltage, low-current inaudible signal that flows into a thin wire connected to the exterior of the microphone.

‘This looped, inaudible signal creates a modulated electrostatic field around the body of the person who is holding the microphone and can be transmitted from person to person via any sort of physical contact.’

Bone conduction technology, which transmits sound through the inner ear, isn't new. 

Special forces and police departments often use the technology, which allows headphones to operate without 'leaking' sound. 

It has, however, recently moved into the mainstream with its use in commercial headphones such 'Aftershoks' as well as its use in Google's Glass.

It's latest use in the Ishin-Den-Shin system received an honorary mention at this 
week's Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria.

Disney said it is hoping to use the device to create ‘magical’ storytelling 
experiences at its attractions.

 A Shure 55 microphone is connected to a 
computer’s sound card.

The microphone records as soon as a sounds 
of amplitude higher than a set threshold is sensed.

The computer then 
creates a loop with the recording, that is sent back to an amplification 
driver.

This amplification driver converts the recorded sound signal 
into a high voltage, low current (<300 Vpp, <50 uA) inaudible 
signal.

The output is connected to the casing of the microphone via an almost 
invisible wire wrapped around the audio cable.

When holding 
the microphone, the whisperer comes in contact with the inaudible, high 
voltage, low power version of the recorded sound.

This creates a 
modulated electrostatic filed around the visitors’ skin.

When touching 
another person’s ear, this modulated electrostatic field creates a very 
small vibration of the ear lobe.

As a result, both the finger and the 
ear together form a speaker, that makes the signal audible for the 
person touched.
