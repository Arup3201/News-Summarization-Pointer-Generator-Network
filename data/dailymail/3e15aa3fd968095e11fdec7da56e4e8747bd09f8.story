George Zimmerman's lawyers have revealed that the former neighborhood watch volunteer could bring his own lawsuits following his not guilty verdict.

Speaking on Good Morning America on Monday, attorney Don West said that Zimmerman, who was cleared of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, is considering taking action over how his case was handled.

'If you look at this case and take away the emotion of the loss of Trayvon Martin's life... and look at what happened, we have a lot of political and social pressures that [we] normally would not... and there may be compensation for something like that,' West said.

He added that they could potentially take legal action over the way Zimmerman was prosecuted, who decided to bring the charges against him 'and everything that's happened to George Zimmerman'.

The charges and subsequent witch hunt came despite the Sanford Police initially choosing not to charge him because of a lack of evidence, he said.

It comes as the attorneys said they would now be pursuing action against NBC for how it edited the 911 calls Zimmerman made to dispatchers the night of February 26, 2012.

The edited tapes depicted Zimmerman as a racial profiler after he came across the teenager walking through a Sanford neighborhood to his father's home, armed with nothing but a bag of sweets.

On March 27 last year, NBC aired a version of the tapes which said: 'This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black.'

In fact, the full tape showed Zimmerman had only said Martin was black when asked by a dispatcher.

George Zimmerman's call to 911:

Zimmerman: 'This guy looks like he’s up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking 
around, looking about.'

Dispatcher: 'OK, and this guy - is he black, white
or Hispanic?'

Zimmerman: 'He looks black.'

NBC version, aired March 27, 2012

Zimmerman: 'This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black.'

'This guy looks like he’s up to no good,' Zimmerman said on the tapes.
'Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking 
around, looking about.'

The dispatcher asked: 'OK, and this guy - is he black, white
or Hispanic?'

Zimmerman said: 'He looks black.'

He sued NBC for defamation over the editing last December, but the case was put on hold pending the outcome of the trial.

NBC maintained that other media outlets had also highlighted the racial angle of the killing, and said that if he was convicted, this would show Zimmerman's loss of reputation was his own doing, rather than that of any media outlet.

With no conviction brought, Zimmerman is now ready to move forward with the suit, one of his lawyers told the Washington Post.

'We’re going to start in earnest asap, we just have to get the stay lifted which is a ministerial act,' James Beasley said.

He added that the verdict had shown the jury did not believe Zimmerman was a racial profiler and now 'it's simply time for us to start the case and hold accountable anyone who was irresponsible in their journalism'.

Zimmerman's lawyers said on GMA that due to the charges, Zimmerman's life is forever changed. Following the verdict, protests have erupted across the country and their client is now fearful.

'I think he's aware of [the anger 
against him], he's been aware of it for 16 months,' Mark O'Mara said. 
'He’s become the focus of a lot of people's dismay, disgust, anger about
the event that happened that night.'

Asked
if Zimmerman was scared, O'Mara added: 'Absolutely. He's been scared 
for 16 months and with anger like this I think he has good reason to be 
worried.'

West dismissed calls for Zimmerman's gun to be seized - because now he needs it more than ever.

'I don't know how he could not lawfully carry a gun at this point since he has been lawfully allowed to carry one,' he said. 'This is the worst time in his life isn't it?'

Protests have spread across the country in the wake of the sensational not-guilty verdict.

Demonstrations - from Florida where the trial took place to Atlanta, DC and New York - remained largely peaceful, though Los Angeles protesters managed to shut down an entire freeway and thousands of New Yorkers mobbed Times Square and blocked traffic for an hour.

Emotional crowds screamed 'Justice for Trayvon' and carried signs that likened the struggle of the slain teen and his supporters to that of the original civil rights movement.
