A young Oregon couple and their baby who fell desperately ill after moving into a newly purchased home have discovered that the house is a former meth lab that has been emitting highly toxic fumes ever since they moved in.

Beth and Jonathan Hankins of Klamath Falls bought the property through foreclosure in the summer and though they recognised it was a fixer-upper, could never have predicted the traumatic events that would follow.

Within a matter of days, Beth began experiencing problems with her breathing and by week three of their occupancy, Jonathan and their infant son, Ezra, had been struck with agonising sores, migraines and nose bleeds. 

Happy days: Jonathan, Beth and baby Ezra Hankins bought their foreclosed home in the summer for $36,000 but soon all three of them had fallen ill with breathing difficulty, migraines and mouth sores

More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history

Oblivious to the connection, the couple were about to make a call to the doctor when a neighbour revealed the shocking truth about the home's previous tenants and just as quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their nightmare.

The owner of a coffee house and an ER nurse, Mr and Mrs Hankins had bought the home from government-sponsored Freddie Mac.

'We said, "It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,"' Jonathan Hankins told Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous.'

Buying the home 'as is', they were informed of their responsibilities for detecting lead paint and asbestos hazards and chose not to bother with an inspection that would only point out superficial repairs anyway.

Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it

Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home

Neither brokers nor the Freddie Mac representatives warned them of any drug activity on the property so armed with paintbrushes and an optimism - illustrated in a happy family picture on the day of closing - the Hankins moved into their new home.

After hearing the news from their neighbour, a $50 testing kit proved that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit.

Wasting no time, Mr Hankins moved his wife and baby boy out of the property and into a rental.

'The walls were poisoning us,' he concluded as he lamented that the couple are now facing financial ruin.

How a young couple could have been allowed to purchase such a dangerous home with no warning is part of a complicated legal story.

Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores

Innocence: Ezra before he contracted mouth sores is one of the luckier children according to Joe Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup who says he has spoken to families who children have died owing to the toxic fumes of meth

Though in 23 states including Oregon, laws require seller to disclose if a property was ever used as a clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the Klamath Falls house's history.

And because they sold it 'as is' to the Hankins family, it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery.

Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German told Yahoo News: 'We certainly empathize with the situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.'

Joe Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup, a company that does what it says on the label, admitted that even with disclosure laws, only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you don't always see the meth residue.'

'It's extremely dangerous stuff' he said of methamphetamine.

Home-style: A home-made meth lab likely similar to the one in the Hankins home that a $50 tester kit revealed emitted fumes 80 times higher than the legal rate of contamination

He also explained that information regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of foreclosure.

According to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years.

While sadly Michigan has no disclosure laws, the meth lab expert said: 'I could tell you stories like that for days.'

Mr Hankins meanwhile is less willing to let Freddie Mac off the hook for their part in the sale and vented his frustration on Change.org.

Before: Mrs Hankins and her family now face financial ruin as they are billed $5,000 to $15,000 for the clean-up on top of a mortgage and rent from the place they are living now

Peace: Mr Hankins, a coffee shop owner has posted an online petition asking Freddie Mac who sold them the house to shoulder the cost of the clean-up

Posting an online petition to try and hold them accountable for the costs of the clean up, he wrote: 'Freddie Mac advertises, "Our qualifying homes come with a reviewed title, and a repaired living space making them easier to sell and improving home values in your territory. We sell our homes responsibly. Freddie Mac is committed to having the best property maintenance and sales standards in the country."

'We had no reason to expect otherwise. Instead, they irresponsibly sold us a ticking time bomb of dangerous chemicals without even telling us.'

But attorneys are insisting that the 'as-is' fine print is what will ultimately leave the $5,000 to $15,000 clean-up burden on Mr Hankins' shoulders.

A quote he has been given costs more than the house is worth.
