Alerted: Documents claim twod eaths could have been avoided had Andy Burnham's department taken action after he was alerted in January 2010

Labour’s former health secretary was told about a string of baby deaths – despite his claims he did not remember any ‘specific’ warnings, it emerged last night.

Andy Burnham said he did not recall being told about the problems at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria.

But documents seen by the Mail show Mr Burnham was briefed about the problems in January 2010, three months before his regulator gave the hospital a clean bill of health.

It is thought the lives of two babies might have been saved at Furness had action been taken by Mr Burnham after he was alerted.

Mr Burnham was briefed on the scandal ahead of a meeting with local MP, Tim Farron, in January 2010.

The memo he was given mentions five maternity, neonatal and gynaecological incidents including the death of baby Joshua Titcombe, who was killed in 2008 by an infection which should have been treated with antibiotics.

It states that Joshua’s death ‘highlighted a number of underlying contributory factors’ at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital.

Mr Burnham did not act on the information in the memo, which notes that the incident was being taken ‘very seriously’ and that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and  Strategic Health Authority were monitoring the trust.

Three months later, the CQC reduced its risk rating of the Trust to ‘green’ and registered it as compliant. A further two babies died after this decision. In July, Mr Burnham faced pressure to quit after a review by Sir Bruce Keogh revealed failings at 11 hospitals where ‘thousands’ of patients needlessly died on his watch.

Last week, Mr Burnham was accused of trying to suppress a critical report into poor hygiene standards at the Basildon and Thurrock trust in Essex.

Emails were released suggesting his department ordered the CQC not to release a report on the problems during the run-up to the 2010 general election.

Mr Burnham has strongly denied the claims and has threatened Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt with legal action after he tweeted about the scandal.

However, the latest revelations over Morecambe Bay will reignite claims that bad news about the NHS was being suppressed.

In June, Mr Burnham denied that he had been warned about the Morecambe Bay scandal.

Last night, Tory MP David  Morris said: ‘This new evidence blows out of the water his claim that he received no warnings about Morecambe Bay.

‘I fail to see how you could forget or not follow up on a meeting where you’re warned about  serious hospital incidents involving the deaths of babies.’

A spokesman for Andy Burnham said: ‘Andy Burnham has acted entirely properly at all times in relation to Morecambe Bay. A thorough review of his papers shows it was not directly raised with him, nor were any specific warnings given to him by the regulator. All of the statements he has made on this issue are entirely accurate.

‘The only meeting he had about this Trust during his time as  secretary of state was requested by Tim Farron MP on local cancer services.

'Information on maternity was provided in an annex to the official briefing as part of a wider list of issues that might have been raised by the MP. As this issue was not raised at the meeting, there was no call for it to be used.

‘In any event, the note records that investigations by the CQC and SHA were at that time on-going. This was the proper course of action. No ministerial intervention was required or appropriate that time.’
