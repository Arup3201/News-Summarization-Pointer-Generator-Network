This is the moment Britain First, a Christian group determined to see off Islamic fundamentalism,. harasses an innocent Muslim family attending the Old Bailey for a case of their murdered son.

City of London police intervene to protect the family who cower in a doorway near the Central Criminal Court.

One man shouts that he knows which mosque the family attend and another accuses the police of protecting Islam.

The scenes are taken from London's 
Holy Turf War, a new documentary that shows on one side the Muslim patrol berating people who 
drink or dress provocatively in the streets while on the other is the 
Christian patrol, members of a new group Britain First, a political party and 'street defence organisation' that says it 'opposes and fights the many injustices that are routinely inflicted on the British people'.

The Muslim patrol is supported by the controversial Anjem Choudary who wants to see the introduction of sharia into Britain.

Three of 
its members were jailed on December 6, 2013. Jordan Horner, a 19-year 
old Islamic convert who calls himself Jamaal Uddin, pleaded guilty to 
two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and 
behaviour, was sentenced to 68 weeks’ imprisonment. Ricardo MacFarlane, 
36, who pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to one year for affray and two
 years for using threatening words and behaviour.

A 23-year old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty and received a six-month sentence for affray.

In the documentary Vice
 News reporter Alex Miller goes on patrol with the patrols and speaks to
 Choudary and Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First.

Over the last year a quasi-religious turf war has sprung up on the streets of London. Young radicalised Muslim patrols are enforcing Shariah law in the capital. In reaction, far right Christian Patrols are also taking the law into their own hands

Muslim extremists wants shariah introduced into Britain

Protests on the streets of east London to combat Muslim extremism have become more frequent and more violent

Choudary has been associated with a number of organisations that have been proscribed under terrorism laws.

He told Miller: ‘I think that there’s an inevitability that Muslims will be the majority one day in Britain and some form of sharia is coming.

‘Islam is not a religion of peace ... It is a religion of submission. We need to submit to the will of Allah.’

Britain First staged a protest outside the Old Bailey as Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowal, the killers of Lee Rigby, were sentenced for his murder.

Members of Britain First insist that the killers should be ‘taken to the nearest tree and hung (sic)’ and that in ‘ten years there’ll be a right-wing government and that will happen’.

They did themselves no favours, however, by harassing an innocent Muslim family who were there for another case.

The film crew accompanied Abdul Mahid, a key member of Choudary's entourage, as he embarked on one of his vigilante patrols of east London to police behaviour that does not comply with sharia.

Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, says that his organisation is ¿doing the job the government refuse to do, which is clamp down on Muslim extremism

Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, says that his organisation is ‘doing the job the government refuse to do, which is clamp down on Muslim extremism’. He led a convoy down Brick Lane in an armour-plated ex-British Army Land Rover, distributing anti-Islamic materials to pedestrians.

Some people take the leaflets while others throw them on to the floor.

Miller finishes by saying that Choudary and Golding while representing extreme views need each other to survive.
