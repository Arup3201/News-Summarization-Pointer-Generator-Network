For just a moment it looked as if the brilliance that had earned Martin Kaymer a place in the record books at the halfway point of the 114th United States Open was about to unravel.

Becoming the first man to open a major championship with two rounds of 65 suddenly appeared more than 24 hours ago. Now he was staring down a 15ft putt for a bogey at the fourth.

Miss it and he would have been three over par at that early stage, and his six shot lead would have been halved after less than an hour’s play.

What followed, though, proved the start of 15 minutes of sheer guts and class that kept the 29-year-old from Dusseldorf firmly on course to claim his second major championship, following his win in the USPGA in 2010.

The putt, like so many over the first 36 holes, was drained, to be followed by an approach to the par five 5th that might well prove the shot of the championship.

From the ‘native area’ just off the fairway to the left, Kaymer played a long iron so precise it pitched on the only sliver of green available for it to finish close to the flag, and he holed the ensuing six-footer for a fabulous eagle three.

There is still work to do today, though, thanks to the spirited efforts of Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton but Kaymer’s last shot of the third round looked significant.

A fine approach was followed by a confident six foot birdie putt for a 72 that stretched his lead back to five shots going into the final round. ‘I didn’t play as well as I did the first two days but the pins were in more difficult positions as well,’ said Kaymer. ‘I’m obviously pleased with my position, but I know the tournament is far from won.’

Is there a more remarkable athlete in sport than Compton? There’s certainly not a more remarkable golfer. Don’t talk to the 34-year-old about adversity on the course. He’s known plenty off it after undergoing not one but two heart transplants but here he is, with a chance to win his national championship after a 67.

Deposed champion: Justin Rose has admitted he will be handing over his US Open title this year

Fowler, who grew up idolising Payne Stewart who won here in 1999 and donned plus fours as a tribute on day one, is on the same three under par mark after a 67 of his own, while the dangerous Henrik Stenson will start six shots off the lead, alongside Dustin Johnson.   

Defending champion Justin Rose accepted he was handing the trophy after a round of 70. It’s been a decent defence nonetheless, although he was irritated by failing to get up and down on three occasions and staining his card with a three-putt.

He was still the best of a disappointing UK challenge, though, in tied tenth spot with Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter unable to get into contention following rounds of 74.  

Sheffield teenager Matt Fitzpatrick was another to suffer in the more difficult conditions as he ran up a 78 but today will be a memorable one for him regardless. His final day in the non-paid ranks will conclude with him being presented with the silver medal as low amateur.

Frustrated figure: Rory McIlroy watches on as he misses a putt for birdie on the 12th green at Pinehurst

It completes quite a collection for the gilded 19-year-old, since he can place it next to a similar medal he won at the Open at Muirfield last year, and the trophy he collected for becoming England’s first US Amateur Champion for more than a century last August.

And so the real world awaits, and it will be fascinating to see how the most feted British amateur since a tender Justin Rose in 1998 gets on.

Rose, of course, earned similar status as the apple of the golfing world’s eye when he turned pro after finishing fourth at the Open at Royal Birkdale. He promptly went on a downward spiral that saw him miss 21 halfway cuts in a row.

Cool customer: Swede Henrik Stenson is six shots behind Kaymer on two-under-par overall

So who better than Rose to consult about the pitfalls facing Fitzpatrick, in his attempts to justify the hype? The pair played together for the first two rounds here, and Rose was as impressed as anyone at the manner in which Fitzpatrick coped with the clamour of playing with Phil Mickelson to become the only amateur to make the halfway cut.

‘I have talked to Matt about what lies ahead and I hope he learns from my own experience because he’s a great lad and a wonderful player,’ said Rose. ‘It is very easy to get distracted thinking you need to get your European Tour card or your PGA Tour card or get your world ranking to such and such position.

‘When you do that you’re just heaping pressure on yourself and I’m sure Matt will not make that mistake. Turning pro is a huge step for anyone, though. I don’t think you’re ever 100 per cent ready because at the end of the day it is a process to get better year on year for the next 20 years for him. That’s what you have to focus on.’

Young gun: Matt Fitzpatrick will be presented with the silver medal as low amateur on Sunday

Fitzpatrick’s first event will be the Irish Open which starts on Thursday and may well prove a wise place to make his debut, since much of the spotlight will inevitably fall on returning heroes like Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell.

First, though, the US Open presentation ceremony, where it looks for all the world like being an England-Germany affair.
