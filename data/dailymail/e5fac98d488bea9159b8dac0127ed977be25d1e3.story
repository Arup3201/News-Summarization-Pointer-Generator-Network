Claire Hessan has been given the all clear after being diagnosed with the rare nasopharyngeal cancer

A mother-of-two who had a rare cancerous tumour growing behind her face was misdiagnosed by doctors who prescribed ear drops.

Claire Hessan went to her GP after developing hearing loss, a strange itch in her ear and lumps in her neck after the birth of her second child in 2008.

The 39-year-old was fitted with a grommet - a device fitted into the eardrum to allow air to pass into the middle ear and release pressure - and given ear drops.

A string of experts concluded her problems were caused by pregnancy hormones.

A year later Ms Hessan was sent for an MRI because her condition was showing no signs of improving.

Returning to the doctor, further investigations revealed the true cause of Ms Hessan's symptoms - a huge tumour growing behind her nasal passage.

The cancer, which had spread to her neck and cheeks, is so rare doctors at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon said they see just one or two cases a year.

Head and neck consultant Tass Malik, who treated Ms Hessan, said the cancer can be hard to spot because it lies hidden behind the nose, 'frequently presenting quite late'.

It is rarely diagnosed in the West, but is more common in smog-plagued cities in China and other parts of Asia.

Doctors treating the mother-of-two, from Callington in Cornwall, started her on an intensive course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

For six months she was fed through a tube in her stomach, unable to to eat properly.

But after losing five stone, Ms Hessan's body slowly recovered and she was given the all clear.

Office manager Ms Hessan, who is mother to Owen, six, and daughter Teagan, eight, said: 'When I was six months pregnant I started to get a really itchy ear and they kept giving me ear drops and saying it was fine.

'They put a grommet in my ear and it was great it, I could hear again.

'But then I started getting lumps in my neck and went to the doctor who said it was pregnancy hormone related, as did the ear, nose and throat specialist.

'A third specialist sent me for an ultrasound on my neck, which came back clear.

'The children gave me the strength to fight through it. I said from the
 start I didn't bring them into this world to leave them at such an 
early age'

'But when Owen had just turned one I went for an MRI scan and biopsy and they found that it was cancer.

'The doctors said it was a very rare tumour which is more prevalent in Asia. The closest I have got to going to China is having a Chinese.

'At first I just thought "I’m going to die." You think "how long have I got to live, how am I going to pay the mortgage?"

'My daughter Teagan was three at the time. It was the last thing I was expecting to hear. I was working full time as a PA having just gone back after maternity leave.'

Ms Hessan’s treatment involved a series of exhausting five-day bouts of chemotherapy.

She had a special surgical mask made for her so doctors at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, would know the precise spots to target with their equipment.

The mother-of-two first noticed the symptoms - a loss of hearing, a strange itch in her ear and a lump in her neck, after the birth of her son in 2008. Doctors prescribed her ear drops, before further investigations revealed a huge tumour growing behind her face, at the point which the nose meets the throat

Tass Malik, the consultant head and 
neck surgeon who treated Claire Hessan at Derriford Hospital, said: 'The cancer 
that Claire had is one of the rarer types. We see one or two cases per 
year in this trust.

'The symptoms can be of slow onset because the cancer is hidden in the back of the nose, so it frequently presents quite late.

'Some patients have no symptoms until the cancer has spread to the neck lymph glands.

'Others
 experience one-sided hearing loss due to fluid building up behind their
 ear and others may experience nose bleeds and nasal blockages.

'Claire’s
 case required a large dedicated team.

'Treatment included biopsies, to 
determine the type of cancer, scans to allow us to pinpoint the location
 and extent of the cancer, followed by treatment of chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy.

'Claire
 has been inspirational and has lots of inner strength, which helped her
 to complete her challenging treatment. We would like to wish her all 
the best in this year’s Race for Life.'

By then, the cancer had spread to the back of Ms Hessan’s head and her collarbone but the fear of losing her children spurred her on.

She said: 'My cheeks and face were burning. I had a wisdom tooth removed because they didn’t know what the problem was.

'The first few times at radiotherapy seemed quite easy but being on the table for such a long time for six weeks, I had to find something to focus on while lying there.

'My daughter Teagan had the cutest little bum wiggle ever and I used to lie there and think of that in my mind.

'I was suffering from dry mouth - it zapped my saliva glands. I was fed through my stomach for around six months.

'I had crates and crates of these milkshakes and it often went in my stomach and came back out my mouth - it’s meant to be the other way round.

'The children gave me the strength to fight through it. I said from the start I didn’t bring them into this world to leave them at such an early age.'

Since being given the all-clear Ms Hessan has decided to raise funds for the battle against rare forms of cancer and is taking part in this year’s Race For Life event.

Claire Hessan was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer, which starts to grow behind the nose, where it meets the throat.

Cases of nasopharyngeal cancer are very rare in the UK - with around 240 cases being diagnosed nationwide each year. It accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed.

It is more common in some ethnic groups living in the UK, for example people of Chinese origin.

Experts do not know exactly what causes nasopharyngeal cancer, but a poor diet is thought to put people at risk.

People who eat more fresh vegetables, 
fresh fruit and other sources of vitamin C may have a lower risk of 
developing nasopharyngeal cancer.

It is more common in parts of Asia, Northern Africa and the Arctic that it is in Europe.

Nasopharyngeal cancer is very rare in the West, affecting 240 people each year in the UK. It accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed in the country each year. File picture shows cancer cells

Diets very high in salt cured meats and fish or pickled foods are more common in some of these places.

These foods can be very high in nitrates and nitrities, which react with protein to form nitrosamines. These chemicals can damage DNA.

Studies in China and Hong Kong have shown that babies and young people who eat Chinese cured and salted fish are at an especially high risk of nasopharyngeal cancer later in life.

Other studies have looked at the link between certain viruses and developing nasopharyngeal cancer.

Specific viruses cause genetic changes in cells that make them more likely to become cancerous in the future. It does not mean that cancers can be caught like an infection. There are links between the Epstein Barr virus and human papilloma virus are certain nasopharyngeal cancers.

Those who have relatives who have suffered nasopharyngeal cancer, people who have had chronic ear, nose and throat diseases and smokers all have an increased risk of getting the disease.

Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include:- A lump or growth in the neck area that does not disappear after three weeks- Hearing loss- Tinnitus- Fluid collection in the ear- Blocked nose, especially on one side- Blood stained discharge from the nose- Headache- Double vision- Numbness in the lower part of the face- Difficulty in swallowing- Changes in voice - such as hoarseness
