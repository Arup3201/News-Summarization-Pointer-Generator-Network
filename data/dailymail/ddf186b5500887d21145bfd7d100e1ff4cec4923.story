Colin Walker, 77, drove his Nissan Micra the wrong way up the motorway

A confused pensioner who drove the wrong way on a motorway told police that it was his first mistake in 50 years.

Colin Walker, 77, who is now undergoing tests for Alzheimer's Disease, said: 'It's my first mistake in 50 years on the roads.'

The pensioner wreaked havoc on the M56 near Manchester Airport as cars swerved to avoid crashing into his Nissan Micra. A court heard he was lucky to be alive as he was sentenced for dangerous driving after his terrifying journey.

The pensioner's Micra collided with a Volkswagen Polo at junction 5 of the motorway after he attempted to do a u-turn. Both cars were badly damaged but the drivers escaped with minor injuries.

Manchester Crown Court heard that Mr Walker, of Leng Road, Newton Heath, has suffered a number of other episodes of disorientation since that day and is undergoing tests for Alzheimer's disease.

The court was told he was attempting to visit relatives in Wythenshawe in the afternoon when he mistakenly took the spur road for Manchester Airport and found himself going around the roundabout for terminals.

Then, as he attempted to recover his way, he ended up travelling the wrong way down the spur road and the motorway itself. Drivers swerved to avoid Mr Walker as he hurtled towards them, with a Land Rover narrowly avoiding crashing into him.

Then, in an ill-fated bid to get out of 
harm's way, he tried to do a u-turn at the exit slip, causing the smash 
with the oncoming Polo in the eastbound carriageway at 4.30pm in the 
afternoon on July 25 last year.

When interviewed by police last October, he told police: 'It's one mistake I've made in 50 years - no one got hurt.'

He went on to plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving

The pensioner drove in the wrong direction up the M56 near Manchester Airport and was forced to do a U-turn.

Nick Flanagan, defending, told his sentencing hearing: 'The prognosis isn't clear, but if it's the onset of Alzheimer's it isn't something which quickly comes on - it's a gradual process that may go some way to explaining what happened on this occasion.

'The reality is this is a 77-year-old man who's never been in any trouble before and not likely to be again - he has no intention of driving.'

Sentencing, Recorder Philip Curran made Mr Walker subject to a three-year conditional discharge and banned from the road for the same period. He will have to take an extended retest if he is to drive again.

The judge told Manchester Crown Court that he would not ban Mr Walker for life as his difficulties might be treated

He told him: 'As you said to police, it was one error in 50 years, but it was a very serious error indeed and it could have led to your death and the deaths of others. That's why it is such a serious event. It must have been a frightening experience for you and the other road-users swerving to avoid you.Â 

'You really should have pulled into the hard shoulder and stopped instead of trying to do a u-turn.

'You really did aggravate the situation, but I suspect that may happened because of the traumatic situation you were in.'

The judge said it would be wrong to ban the pensioner for good, saying there was a possibility his difficulties could be treated, and that it was a matter for the driving authorities.

As he left court, Mr Walker said: 'What I did, I've not done it on purpose.'
