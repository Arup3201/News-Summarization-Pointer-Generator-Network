Rookie IndyCar driver Mikhail Aleshin was rushed to a hospital in serious but stable condition Friday night after a horrifying crash in the final practice session for the series season finale.

Aleshin, 27, was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center in California. The Russian driver suffered broken ribs and a broken right collarbone along with a concussion and chest injuries, an IndyCar spokesperson said.

On Saturday evening, Aleshin’s condition was upgraded to stable after he underwent a medical procedure.

Miracle: The driver of the other car improbably walked away from the crash unscathed

IndyCar announced Aleshin's improvement before its season-ending race at Fontana.

At least three drivers played a role in the crash at the Fontana track in Turn 4, which had a gaping hole in the catch fencing and a wheel wrapped in the fence after Aleshin’s car violently flew up against it.

Aleshin, who drives for Sam Schmidt, spun when he went below the white line in the turn.

He slid back up the track and collided with Charlie Kimball in a shower of sparks and smoke, sending Aleshin’s car flying into the catch fence while spinning.

Kimball improbably escaped serious injury, walking away from his wrecked car. Debris was strewn all over the track as safety personnel gathered around the wreck of Aleshin, who was removed on a stretcher.

Aleshin is the first Russian driver in IndyCar history, joining a team with title contender Simon Pagenaud this year after a career in open-wheel racing in Europe.

He is 15th in the overall points standings with seven top-10 finishes this season, including a career-best fifth-place finish at the Grand Prix of Indianapolis in May.

The 27-year-old driver also had several run-ins with Sebastien Bourdais earlier in the season, and he was involved in an unusual crash with Juan Pablo Montoya in Toronto.

Montoya was stalled in a tire barrier when Aleshin spun into the back of his car. Aleshin then slid under Montoya, leaving tire marks on Aleshin’s helmet and requiring a tow truck to lift Montoya’s car off Aleshin.

In July, Aleshin hurt his left wrist after crashing with Takuma Sato of Japan at the Iowa Speedway in Newton, Iowa, during the Verizon IndyCar Series. 

The two-mile Fontana track is a fast, high-banked oval with well-worn, bumpy and occasionally dusty asphalt, providing a challenge even for veteran drivers.

Helio Castroneves won the pole for Saturday’s race with an average speed of more than 218 mph in his qualifying lap Friday, when temperatures reached 100 degrees in Fontana.

Although IndyCar racing on ovals can be spectacular, the risk factor is high. Dan Wheldon was killed in a 15-car accident in the 2011 season finale at Las Vegas, another high-banked oval.

The IndyCar series finale is scheduled for Saturday night. Aleshin was eighth in qualifying earlier Friday, easily the best finish by a rookie.
