A man was exposed as a bigamist after his first wife tracked him down on Facebook - only to discover wedding pictures of him and his new spouse.

Brian Frain, 36, of Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, is now facing a possible prison sentence following Anne-Marie Sim's shock find.

Frain married Ms Sim at Tameside Register Office in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, in June 1999 after a two-month ‘whirlwind romance’, a court was told.

Brian Frain is facing prison after he was exposed as a bigamist. His first wife, seeking a divorce, tracked him down on Facebook and discovered pictures of his second wedding to Louise Meredith

They separated after two months and she moved to Scotland. Tameside Magistrates’ Court was told that she attempted to get in touch with Frain five years later to seek a divorce as she wanted to re-marry.

She contacted solicitors and hired a firm to track him down, but they couldn’t locate him.

Eventually, Mrs Frain turned detective herself and hunted him down through Facebook - where she saw the wedding pictures of his marriage in September 2009 to Louise Meredith, the court heard. He used the same register office for both weddings.

Frain claimed he thought the marriage was over because it had only lasted two months and took place 10 years ago.

David Curtis, prosecuting, said: 'She made enquiries with the register office and he had not told them that he was already married.'

Mr Curtis said that in interviews, Frain admitted that he had married in 1999.

He said: 'Due to the amount of time that had passed, Mr Frain assumed that he was no longer married to her.

'He did not inform the register office and took no legal advice.'

The court was told Frain met his second wife Louise, from Droylsden, in June 2007.

They formed a friendship after they exchanged messages over the internet, district judge Paul Richardson heard.

Mr Curtis added: 'He made no mention that he was married. Police were contacted and Frain was later arrested.'

Frain pleaded guilty to a single count of bigamy. The case was adjourned for sentence.

In a statement written by Ms Meredith, read out to the court, she said: 'Although I had been married before, I was under the impression that this was Brian’s first marriage.

'The wedding went well. I truly believed that I was his first wife. This has obviously affected me.'

The court was told that they are no longer together.

Rachel Wilson, defending, said Frain claims his second wife knew that he was married. District judge Richardson ruled that a short trial would be held on August 7 to settle the point.

Ms Wilson said: 'He fully complied with the police. Ten years later he meets the second wife. He believes that at that stage, his marriage no longer existed because of the fact that it was only for two months and it was 10 years ago.

'He accepts that he was ignorant.'

District judge Richardson told Frain:
'It makes a difference whether or not you deceived this lady. Your 
statements are opposite and we are going to have a trial of the issue.'

Out of the blue: Louise Meredith said she was in 'shock' when police told her about the bigamy investigation

Frain was bailed to appear again in court on August 7.

After the case, Louise, 34, said: 'I got a phone call around February this year from the police asking about Brian. I said I am not with him.

'They informed me there was a bigamy investigation - I was in shock. I wanted to see him, I wanted answers.'
