Generous Good Samaritans known collectively as 'layaway angels' have been reminding everyone what the holiday season is all about.

Many US retailers have dusted off the once-popular layaway option in recent years, offering customers to reserve merchandise and pay for in installments.

But shoppers on a tight budget often find themselves scrambling to come up with the money to cover their debt in time for the holidays so they can bring home presents for their loved ones.

That is where the 'layaway angels' come in.

In Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, a mysterious donor who calls himself 'Santa B' shelled out $50,000 to cover all the layaway balances at the local Wal-mart this week.

'He said he wanted to help take care of folks – to bring everyone a special Christmas,' store manager Steve Myers told Pennlive.com.

The do-gooder, who chose to remain anonymous, sent a check to the store and instructed Wal-mart staff to donate any money left from his gift to charity.

Shoppers at the suburban big-box store who have inadvertently become the generous donor's beneficiaries were touched by his gesture - but also disappointed they were unable to thank him in person.

'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things,’ Brittny Coeyman told Fox43.

'Santa B's' grand gesture is part of a cultural phenomenon that has been observed in across the country.

In Auburn, Massachusetts, Cathy O'Grady, a jewelry company owner and the founder of the charitable organization Sofia's Angels, walked into a local Toys R Us last week and paid just shy of $20,000 for strangers' layaway purchases.

O'Grady says her mother, Sofia, who passed away from breast cancer 17 years ago, and who inspired her enterprise, taught her to be generous.

‘She was always a giver, and I wasn't sure how I was going to carry on her legacy and her memory,’ O'Grady told ABC News. ‘It took me long enough to figure out what I wanted to do.’

The kind-hearted Good Samaritan turned out to be Jed Smith, the owner of Smith Company Motor Car, who spent more than $1,000 in his capacity as a ‘layaway angel,’ reported CBS12.

'I'm Santa Claus today,' he told customer Leann Heater. 'I'm going to cover this for you.'

Heater, who had reserved $600 worth of gifts for her daughter, burst into tears when Smith took money out of his own pocket and paid her bill.

Kmart district manager Dan Radcliffe described the experience as 'overwhelming,' saying that it was a first for him in his 32 years with the company.

‘I have the biggest butterflies in my stomach,’ an overjoyed Walker said. ‘I'm very excited. I'm happy. I'm blessed. This is crazy.’

A Toys R Us in Johnson City, Tennessee, also has been visited by a layaway angel who plunked down more than $5,000 to take care of 52 layaway accounts, including that of Monte Riffey, who was taken aback upon learning that a stranger had paid her $900 balance.

‘Of course, I was very shocked that someone would do that for someone they didn't even know,’ she said. ‘I was very shocked and appreciative.’

Mystery man: 'Santa B' instructed the store to give the rest of the money to charity 

Customer:  Brittny Coeyman told a television station 'We were scraping together the last few minutes here to pay for it, we were actually going to have to return a couple things' before her balance was covered

Another big-time donor paid a visit to the Lake City Wal-mart Supercenter in Florida Monday, closing some 300 layaway accounts to the tune of $63,000.

‘It was an outstanding thing,’ store manager Gary Taylor told ABC News. ‘It's good to know there are still some good Samaritans in the world.’

The Chiefland, Florida, Wal-mart has received a generous check for $51,000 towards the store's layaway accounts, and a location in Kansas City, Missouri, got a $10,000 donation to help out struggling holiday shoppers.

The concept behind 'layaway angels' has been growing in popularity since 2011, when Lee Karchawar founded the Pay Away the Layaway charity to help shoppers settle their store accounts, reported CBS News.

The non-profit organization, which works with Wal-mart, Kmart and Toys R Us, collects donations from individuals, which are then pooled together and used to pay down layaway balances of families who are trying to buy holiday presents for kids. 

The charity raised $25,000 last year but expects to double that amount this year, in part thanks to individual 'layaway angels' like Jed Smith, Cathy O'Grady and 'Santa B.'
