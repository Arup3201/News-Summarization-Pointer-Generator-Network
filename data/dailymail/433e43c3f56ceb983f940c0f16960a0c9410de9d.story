A British family has received more than £23,000 in compensation from a tour operator after their Tunisian holiday was ruined when each of them fell ill with ‘horrendous’ gastric symptoms.

Christopher Sheldon, his wife, Amanda, and their 26-year-old son, Daniel, all suffered stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and headaches during their two-week stay at the Caribbean World Borj Cedria hotel, southeast of Tunis, in October 2011.

Amanda, 45, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and is still suffering from gastric-related symptoms, although her husband and son have both made a full recovery.

Amanda Sheldon still suffers from symptoms three years after the nightmare holiday

Christopher, 47, told MailOnline Travel: ‘She’s still quite bad. She came back with a very bad case of gastroenteritis and every now and again she’s still really bad with it.

‘This has just really sort of rocked her.’

In their claim, the family, from Ashington, Northumberland, complained about unsanitary conditions in the three-star resort’s restaurant.

They said chicken was undercooked, food was served on damaged and dirty crockery on occasion, and uncovered and reheated food was left out for long periods of time.

They also claim to have seen cats roaming free in the restaurant.

The family fell ill just a few days into their two-week stay at Caribbean World Borj Cedria in October 2011

Christopher, formerly a manager in the food and drink industry, said: ‘We were appalled by the state of the restaurant when we arrived and it isn’t something I expected from a three-star resort, it was disgusting.

‘We even overheard staff at one point saying that they would not eat in the restaurant.

‘We all fell ill with horrendous symptoms a few days into the holiday. This meant that we were not able to go on any excursions or explore the local area as we had hoped because we had to stay at the hotel as we felt too ill to travel.

‘My wife is still suffering with stomach issues which she finds very uncomfortable and at times embarrassing. We did not expect our annual holiday to turn out the way it did.

‘We are pleased that our legal battle is now over and feel like we can finally move on from our ordeal.’

 The Sheldons say their 'horrendous' symptoms prevented them from going on excursions

The Sheldons, who booked online with Sunsave Travel Limited, hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to pursue a claim against the Bradford-based tour operator.

Irwin Mitchell said Sunsave Travel Limited denied any liability and a £23,600 settlement was reached after it issued court proceedings.

Nichola Blackburn, a legal specialist with Irwin Mitchell’s international personal injury team said: ‘What was supposed to be a lovely family holiday with their son became ruined by illness. The family saved up hard for their trip and it ended up being one they will never forget, for all the wrong reasons.

‘Sunsave Travel Limited denied liability, Court proceedings were therefore issued.

‘We are pleased that a settlement has been agreed that reflects the illness each family member endured while at the hotel, and also takes into account the on-going altered bowel habits Amanda faces as a result of the holiday.’
