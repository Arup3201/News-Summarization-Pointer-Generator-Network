Graziano Pelle would likely be selling coffee out of a van on the sandy-coloured streets of Lecce, in southern Italy, with his father Roberto had he not met Louis van Gaal in 2007.

If he had listened to his mother he may not even have been a footballer - she wanted him to become a professional dancer. At the age of 13 he was Italy's Latin-American dance champion, partnering his older sister Fabiana.

His father wanted him to play football and he choose that route instead. But it has been far from a straightforward one.

The Southampton striker's career was floundering in Italy, struggling for consistent form at Lecce, who he joined as a teenager, and during loan spells at three lower-league Italian sides.

But then Van Gaal, in charge at AZ Alkmaar, brought a 22-year-old Pelle over to Holland and while he was still not prolific in front of goal he helped them win the Eredivisie in 2009 during a four-year spell.

Van Gaal is renowned for his faith in young players and it was for that reason that Pelle decided to leave his native Italy to try elsewhere.

The Italian forward has been a huge success at Southampton, scoring five goals in his first eight games

'If he'd never met the Dutch guru [Van Gaal], as well as Ronald Koeman, maybe my son would now be a carpenter or he'd be sitting with me in my van, selling coffee,' said Pelle's father in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport.

Pelle had managed just 16 goals in two seasons in Italy, but the move to Holland is considered to have launched his career – and it is where he was given his 'Italian Stallion' nickname, which needs little explaining.

But if the Manchester United manager is to take the plaudits for introducing Pelle to the Dutch league, it is Koeman who must be given credit for sculpting him into the fearsome goalscorer he has become.

Pelle has been a very late developer in the game when it comes to finding the net.

After AZ he returned to try his hand in Italy once more, this time for Parma, but was again frustrated and loaned out first to Sampdoria before Koeman – at this point in charge at Feyenoord – took him on loan in 2012.

Pelle scored  50 goals in 57 games for Dutch side Feyenoord before Southampton paid £8million for him

Ronald Koeman must also be given some credit for developing Pelle both at Feyenoord and Southampton

It was then, just two years ago, that everything clicked into place.

Pelle netted 11 times in his first 10 games, had agreed a deal to make the move permanent by January and ended the season as the Eredivisie's second top-scorer with 27 goals.

During his two seasons in Holland he scored 50 goals in 57 league games before Koeman took Pelle with him to Southampton for £8million.

Five goals in his first eight Saints games finally earned him a first call-up to the national team, at the age of 29, by Italy manager Antonio Conte, where he scored the winner against Malta.

Despite numerous attempts to prove himself in his native country, Pelle always struggled in Serie A

Pelle is modelling himself on Luca Toni, a similarly powerful forward who also blossomed late in his career

'Finally somebody has noticed that there was an Italian who scored 64 goals [in all competitions] in Holland,' Roberto added.

'It's going to be good fun with Conte. Graziano has confided in me that he sees a lot of Van Gaal in him.'

After the match, presenter Donatella Scarnati, on Italian TV channel RAI, introduced him as a 39-year-old by accident. Pelle responded to questions about his age with, 'Better late than never.'

He is looking to Luca Toni, similar in his powerful forward play and in developing late, as inspiration and wants to win as much as he did. Toni, who lead the line for Italy between 2004 and 2009, has the 2006 World Cup plus Bundesliga trophies to his name.

'Dancing with the Stars can wait,' Pelle added to Scarnati, with a smile.
