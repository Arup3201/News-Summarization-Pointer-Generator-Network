If you get irked losing an earring when you go swimming, it's probably not a good idea for you to go anywhere near this swimsuit.

Australian jewellery designer Ann Middleton has created a costume intricately garnished with over 220 diamonds and pearls, a sparkly ensemble that would set you back a dazzling AUS$1m (£583,302).

The elaborate swimmers will be modelled by Samantha Harris at the inaugural Gold Coast Swim Fashion Festival in Queensland at the end of the month, and Harris will be moving about very carefully to ensure none of the precious stones fall off.

Middleton, who has created pieces for Elton John and Bill Clinton in the past, collaborated with swimwear label 
Sunseeker to craft the 133-carat piece, which Harris will wear at the Sunseeker's show at the Surfers Paradise Marriott Resort on November 28.

The designer has been creating jewellery for 39 years, and used almost 100 Australian South Sea pearls in the pricey costume.

She told Australian newspaper the Herald Sun: 'Hundreds of hours went into creating the swimsuit and we used as many Australian gems and pearls as possible.

'I hadn't done a swimsuit before but when I saw the design, I knew I 
wanted to create a seemingly simple, perfect, beautiful garment.'

Festival organiser Leanne St George said the beach-inspired showcase will draw attention to the Gold Coast and Queensland: 'It was a wonderful coup to have Samantha, Ann and Sunseeker come on board with this project.

'Our lifestyle and fashion is unique. It's time to take them to the world.'
