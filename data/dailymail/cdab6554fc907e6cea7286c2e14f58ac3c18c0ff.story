A disabled Staten Island stroke victim was fatally stabbed inside his own home on Sunday after he and his wife came face-to-face with a crazed home intruder..

Peter Gialluisi and Vincenza Gialluisi, both 66, were returning from their joint birthday party celebrated with their grandchildren in New Jersey when they interrupted burglar Dante Viggiano, 20, inside their garage.

He then viciously attacked them, stabbing Peter Gialluisi in face and hands and his wife in the neck and back before fleeing the scene.

Ambushed: This is Peter Gialluisi and Vincenza Gialluisi, both 66, at their joint birthday party with their grand children in New Jersey just hours before they returned home to find the intruder in their garage

According to the New York Daily News, Vincenza dashed across the street to her neighbors to scream for help for her husband, who used a walker to stay mobile.

'She was bleeding from her head, all over her body,' said David DiDia, who rushed to her aid.

Arrested: Dante Viggiano has been charged with Peter Gialluisi's murder

'She was screaming, ‘My husband! My husband! They killed my husband!’

The two rushed to help the stricken man and found him collapsed on the floor outside the garage, but he was still breathing.

Peter Gialluisi was taken to Staten Island University Hospital South but tragically passed away.

He and his wife would have both turned 67 this week.

To pay tribute to Peter, his relatives posted photographs of him smiling alongside his wife and their grandchildren while celebrating their birthdays on Sunday at their son's house in Westfield, New Jersey.

'So beautiful to have spent their birthdays together,' a family friend wrote on Facebook.

'Remember the moments. Be as strong as you can.'

His wife, Vicenza is in a stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital North.

'She dedicated her life to caring for him,' said neighbor Teresa Parenti to the New York Daily News.

'He could not walk a few steps without oxygen.'

Viggiano was picked up by police at his own Staten Island home, which is around three miles from the Gialluisi's. 

Happy:  Peter Gialluisi and Vincenza Gialluisi with their grandchildren in New Jersey during another visit. Peter and Vicenza were attacked on Sunday after they returned home

Scene: The Gialluisi's SUV is seen outside their open garage in Staten Island after the attack on Sunday 

Horrific: More stains are visible on a light post that stands near to the Gialluisi's home in Staten Island

Officers responded to a 911 call from a person who lives with Gialluisi to say that he was worrying them.

He was found with wounds to his hands, presumably caused during his desperate struggle with the elderly couple.

Police say 20-year-old Dante Viggiano was being held on murder, attempted murder and burglary charges in Sunday's stabbings on Staten Island.

Viggiano was in custody pending arraignment. A message was left at a number connected to his address.
