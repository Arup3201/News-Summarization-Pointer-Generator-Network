David Cameron today hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax.

The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax
evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.

It is thought Austria and Luxembourg - the only opponents of tax
transparency - have agreed to back the plan if Switzerland will also do so.

David Cameron is in Brussels today for talks on tax avoidance, where he spoke to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, right, Croatia's Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, second left, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte

Mr Cameron wants to see companies reporting where they pay tax country-by-country, across the EU and the G8.

However there is a risk that some EU countries will want to set up their own, separate, system.

Large-scale tax avoidance schemes are estimated to cost the European Union alone £850 billion a year.

Speaking at a summit in Brussels 
today, Mr Cameron said EU leaders had achieved 'a proper agreement, here
in the EU to start with, that all countries should exchange tax 
information, that all countries should act on beneficial ownership, so 
we know who owns what. I think this is a big step forward.'

The Prime Minister said the EU had persuaded Austria and Luxembourg to drop their complete opposition to tax transparency.

'Today we've agreed to push for a new international standard of automatic information exchange between tax authorities and to help those authorities fight tax evasion with new standards to give them info on who really owns and controls each and every company,' he said.

'Tax evasion is illegal and should be cracked down on as rapidly as possible. Of course governments should more to turn aggressive tax avoidance schemes into tax evasion by making them illegal.

'But no government in the world can move fast enough to catch up with some of practices put in place by some businesses and individuals.

'There is a moral issue - companies have to make decisions about themselves. My decision to put this on top of the G8 agenda has unlocked some really important international action.'

Finance
ministers from 17 EU countries including Britain and Ireland have 
already signed a declaration backing the global system, but 11 have not 
and long-standing opposition has been driven by Luxembourg and Austria, 
where banking secrecy is traditionally sacred.

Iceland's new coalition government has shelved plans to join the European Union.

The centre-right Progressive and Independence parties halted accession talks and promised a referendum before continuing the application.

New Premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson said: 'The government intends to halt negotiations between Iceland and the European Union. We will not hold further negotiations with the European Union without prior referendum.'

Mr Cameron was also at pains to claim that he raised tax avoidance 'very directly' with Google boss Eric Schmidt at a meeting this week.

Downing Street made clear on Monday that the Prime Minister would not refer to reports the search engine firm paid only £10 million in corporation tax in the UK between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9 billion.

However, this morning Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed that he did raise public anger with firms which are not seen to be paying their 'fair share' of tax' with the Google chairman.

He said 'companies, as Google are finding out, are coming under pressure to act'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband today used a speech at a Google event to criticise the 'extraordinary events' the firm goes to in order to avoid paying tax in the UK.

Tonight Mr Cameron insisted he did discuss the broader issue of tax avoidance with Mr Schmidt during the meeting of the Business Advisory Group, but not the particular concerns about Google's tax bill.

The Prime Minister said: 'I raised the issue very directly as he is on my business advisory panel and we discussed the G8 agenda, the tax multinationals are paying and I made sure there were proper contributions from people around the table, including him, on that issue.

'Aside from talking about it what is much more important is taking action, what putting this at the front of the G8 agenda has achieved is a proper agreement, here in the EU to start with, that all countries should exchange tax information, that all countries should act on beneficial ownership, so we know who owns what. I think this is a big step forward.'

He went on: 'I explained my G8 agenda, how important I think it is, I explained I think it is important to tackle not just tax evasion but aggressive tax avoidance.

'I asked Eric Schmidt to comment on that and he did in the meeting. I don’t think we’re going to solve this if we simply take one company or another company that is registered in Europe, this one in Ireland. We are going to solve this we are going to have proper concrete action.'

Before traveling to the EU summit, Mr Cameron warned other countries the losses from tax avoidance were 'staggering'

Algirdas Semeta, European Commissioner for tax, said countries were on course to agree  full automatic exchange of information on income from January 2015.

Reports
about global firms cutting their tax bills by taking advantage of 
differences between national tax systems 'clearly demonstrate that there
are weaknesses in our corporate taxation system both at EU level and 
also internationally', he told BBC Radio 4.

A
package of measures has been put forward by the Commission, including 
general anti-abuse rules in member states, renegotiation of 
double-taxation treaties and a blacklist for tax havens.

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny defended his country's tax regime from criticism that it is used by firms to cut their tax bills

'This package, if implemented thoroughly by member states will make significant change in this area', said Mr Semeta.

Earlier Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny brushed off attacks on Ireland's tax regime for helping multinationals avoid billions in tax - insisting he was backing plans for global tax transparency and an end to tax havens.

Ireland's low corporate tax rates have been identified in inquiries into how companies such as Google and Apple arrange their tax affairs to reduce liabilities to a minimum.

But, heading into EU summit talks in Brussels on cracking down on corporate tax avoidance and tax evasion, Mr Kenny insisted: 'I'd like to repeat that Ireland's corporation tax rate is statute-based, is very clear, very transparent - we do not do special deals with individual companies in relation to that rate.'

The Taoiseach said Ireland was one of the first countries to agree a scheme on sharing of tax information with the US.

'Multinationals, in their aggressive tax planning, operate in many jurisdictions,' he said.

'For that reason, Ireland has been very much to the forefront in having and building more international consensus as far as transparency in tax regimes is concerned.'
