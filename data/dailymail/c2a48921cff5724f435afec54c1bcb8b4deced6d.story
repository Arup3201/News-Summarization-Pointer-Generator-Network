This dramatic CCTV footage shows the moment a drunk van driver lost control of his vehicle and ploughed head-first in to a police van, leaving an officer with 'life-changing' injuries. 

The video was published after the driver, 28-year-old Steven King, was jailed for two and a half years at Birmingham Crown Court today. 

PC Arthur Klucznik was the passenger in the police van and had been dealing with a 999 call at the time.

The wrecked LDV Maxis work van King had driven without permission - he was twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed into the police van in Aston, Birmingham

The video was published after King was jailed for two and a half years at Birmingham Crown Court 

The officer suffered a broken leg in the collision and had to be cut free from the wreckage. He was left trapped in the vehicle and feared it would catch fire.

The court heard he may never be able to return to front-line policing again, as he can now only walk short distances without pain.

King, a father-of-two, was twice the legal drink-drive limit and had hit speeds of 80mph as he raced through traffic without lights on, shortly before midnight on April 26 this year. 

King had hit speeds of 80mph in a 40mph zone as he raced through the traffic without lights on

As he tried to weave through the traffic, he swerved on to the opposite carriageway of the A34 Birchfield Road in Aston, Birmingham and crashed in to the police van. 

Prosecutor Alistair Redford told the court King had been banned from driving for being drunk behind the wheel in 2012, but that night he had taken an LDV Maxis work van without permission.

Mr Redford said: 'The van was driven at speeds between 50mph and 80mph, in these sections there is a 40mph limit.

'Various witnesses described the vehicle as overtaking and cutting in front of them. Some witnesses tried to flash the driver to alert him to the fact his lights were not on.

'Because he had his lights off a vehicle pulled in front of him, the defendant braked sharply and swerved and nearly hit a wall.

'He crossed the central reservation and collided with the police vehicle which had just come out of a tunnel. It was, in effect, a head-on collision which caused the police vehicle to spin around.

'PC Klucznik was trapped and was in fear the vehicle would catch alight. The defendant was thrown through the passenger side window and suffered a broken back in seven places.'

The court heard King had been banned from driving in 2012, but took the van from work without permission

Despite his injuries, Mr Redford added, King continued to shout abuse at the officers who attended the scene and went to hospital with him.

David Swinnerton, defending, said King had shown remorse for his actions and 'knew clearly' how lucky he was that he had not killed PC Klucznik or himself with his 'appalling' driving.

Sentencing him to prison, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said: 'The photos vividly tell the tale of what happened. It is quite simply remarkable nobody was killed in this collision. You were a little more than twice the legal limit and were still being abusive after you were arrested.

'PC Klucznik suffered a serious fracture. Six months later he still needs crutches and the prognosis for him is still uncertain.

'The driver of the police vehicle escaped serious injury but he found it a terrifying experience which is not surprising.'

King had pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to causing serious injury through dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, drink driving and driving without a licence or insurance.
