The heartbroken former fiancée of tycoon Scot Young attended his funeral yesterday with more than 100 guests - including his daughters and the model Caprice.

The service was held at Kensal Green Cemetery in west London more than six weeks after the Dundee-born property magnate fell to his death from the balcony of their luxury penthouse.

Noelle Reno, 31, joined his daughters Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19, at the service this afternoon, but it appears 52-year-old Mr Young's ex-wife Michelle, 50, decided to stay away.

In attendance: More than 100 guests, including former model-turned-businesswoman Caprice (pictured), who appeared alongside Miss Reno in the reality TV show Ladies Of London, were at the private service

Mr Young, who was said to have had a fortune of £2billion and was involved in one of Britain's most notorious divorce cases, plunged 60ft on to railings outside a £3million apartment last month.

His coffin, covered in white roses, was carried in a hearse with flowers spelling 'Daddy'. Relatives arrived in a fleet of more than a dozen luxury cars, headed by two black limousines.

Mourners were driven to a private entrance of the chapel for the service which lasted around one hour, before the coffin was driven to the grave site within the cemetery for the burial ceremony.

Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8.

He had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet.

But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters.

Service: More than 100 guests attended the funeral of Mr Young at Kensal Green Crematorium

In shock: The exact circumstances of Mr Young's death remain a mystery and an inquest will be held this year

Tributes: The flowers and coffin in west London were accompanied by handwritten notes from loved-ones

Close up: Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side'

Many of the father-of-two’s relatives and friends were driven to a private entrance to the crematorium chapel before his burial at the cemetery.

In cold and bright weather, the hearse arrived carrying a mahogany coffin topped with floral tributes, including one made of roses from his daughters, which read 'Daddy'.

Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side.'

Another message said: 'Dear Scot, missing you badly mate and you will always be remembered.' One tribute spoke of their 'great memories' with Mr Young, adding that he was 'one in a million'.

After the hour-long service, Mr Young's friends and family emerged from the chapel led by Noelle Reno, the star of Bravo's Ladies of London reality TV show. He also appeared in the first season.

Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'.

Fall: Mr Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone (above), in the early evening of December 8

Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs.

He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case.

After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone.

When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said.

She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window.

By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'.

Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.
