Lewis Hamilton could not even bring himself to look at Nico Rosberg, the winner of the Monaco Grand Prix.

Neither put his arm around the other’s shoulder for the podium pictures. They then travelled back to the paddock press conference in separate minibuses. They sat on the dais side by side without so much as a glance at each other.

The two World Championship contenders are not talking in private or public.

Rosberg winked at his manager, Georg Nolte. A smile constantly played across his lips. Hamilton, by contrast, glowered from under the long, straight brim of his Mercedes cap. He answered enquiries in a downbeat manner.

The source of the tension was 
Rosberg’s final lap in qualifying on Saturday, when  he missed the 
Mirabeau turn and drove  into an escape road. This brought out  yellow 
caution flags, meaning that Hamilton had to abort his attempt to take 
pole position.

The stewards 
investigated the incident and exonerated Rosberg. The driver steward was
 Derek Warwick, a veteran of 146 grands prix and a man noted for probity
 and fairness.

That, however, did not satisfy Hamilton. He believed Rosberg had deliberately thwarted him. If he did, it was the perfect crime.

So
 tense are relations that the two men did not share a room for their 
post-qualifying debrief.  Hamilton said, slightly implausibly: ‘I went 
to the toilet and Nico did his debrief before I got there, which is 
unusual.’

On Sunday morning
 the froideur persisted. Hamilton rejected  Rosberg’s apology and 
proffered hand. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘This thing we 
have with Lewis accusing the other of doing something stupid, I tried to
 fix it this morning with Lewis but I couldn’t. If they hit each other 
at the first corner, then they have a problem with me.’

Rosberg
 was away cleanly so there was no chance of a collision and the race 
progressed as a predictable procession on Monaco’s narrow streets. 
Rosberg led from lights out to chequered flag to take a  four-point lead
 over second-placed Hamilton in the standings. Daniel Ricciardo, of Red 
Bull, was third to go ahead of his world champion team-mate Sebastian 
Vettel, who retired with a faulty engine.

Hamilton,
 again, showed his petulant side in the cockpit. During the second of 
two safety car periods, after Adrian Sutil crashed his Sauber, both 
Mercedes came in, Rosberg first with Hamilton  arriving at the pit box 
just as his team-mate was vacating it.

Hamilton
 was tetchy. ‘I can’t believe we just had to pit,’ he said over the 
radio. ‘Can you just inform me of what options I have? We should have 
pitted on that lap before but I knew you wouldn’t call me in, guys.’

Later,
 when he had something in his eye and was told how close Ricciardo was 
getting to him, he said: ‘I don’t care about Ricciardo. I want to know 
what the gap is  to Nico.’ Afterwards, Hamilton returned to the subject 
of qualifying and again argued the case against Rosberg by innuendo,  
saying: ‘I wish you could have seen the data. I’m sure you did see on 
TV. If you haven’t seen what was on TV then you should go and watch it. I
 saw something late on last night, and all I could do was smile.’

Pressed
 on the nature of the data he saw, Hamilton said: ‘I’m not going to tell
 you. I just wish you could see it. Then you could see for yourself.’

A straw poll of informed paddock observers returned a verdict split pretty much down the middle on Rosberg’s intentions.

There
 is a background to Saturday’s events. Sources within  Mercedes have 
revealed Hamilton pressed the overtaking mode  button on his steering 
wheel in the closing stages of the Spanish Grand Prix a fortnight ago 
despite being told by his engineers not to. The extra power enabled him 
to hold off Rosberg. Hamilton was admonished, Rosberg mentally noted the
 incident for future reference.

So
 it may be there was a tit-for-tat element to Rosberg’s actions as the 
clock ran down in qualifying: if you play dirty, I’ll play dirty.

Hamilton
 said last week he is hungrier for success because he comes from a 
Stevenage council estate rather than brought up in Monaco as Rosberg was
 (though Hamilton was lavishly funded by McLaren: a salary, a private 
tutor and a Mercedes). But both are tough and resilient. As Lauda said: 
‘You have to be a b****** if you want to win in Formula One. Tell me one
 nice guy out there. Do we start with Fernando Alonso? This is a breed 
of people who are 100 per cent focused. They use every trick to blow the
 other one off. And in the same team it’s harder. Here it’s very tense.’

Hamilton, who at times 
wallows in his distress and wears it indulgently, was somewhat more  
sanguine after the official press conferences when speaking to a smaller
 group of journalists in the garage. ‘What doesn’t break you will make 
you stronger,’ he said.

It 
is rare for an internal team rivalry to erupt so spectacularly as early 
as the sixth race of the  season. Lauda is there to manage it. He is 
close to both drivers and speaks from experience as a three-time world 
champion.

‘You can’t stop 
the rivalry,’ he said. ‘One thing is clear, that Lewis, from my point of
 view, has a one or two tenths advantage over Nico. He can get the laps 
in qualifying.

‘And Nico 
is working hard — my type — with the mechanics and engineers with the 
tyres. So we have one natural talent, very  emotional. And we have 
another guy who is doing the same job in another way.

‘We have two different drivers, but in the end they get the same results. So for me it’s a very good situation.’

Down
 the field, Marussia scored their first points in five years in the 
sport through Jules Bianchi’s ninth place, a contrast with fellow 
back-markers Caterham, whose owner Tony Fernandes has put them up for 
sale just as he is celebrating his football team, QPR, winning promotion
 to the Barclays Premier League.

Jenson Button was another notable achiever, moving from 12th on the grid to finish sixth for McLaren.

Thoughts turn to the next race in Montreal a fortnight hence and the next instalment of the Hamilton-Rosberg feud.

Will they have hugged and made up by then? ‘It will be a while,’ said Hamilton.
