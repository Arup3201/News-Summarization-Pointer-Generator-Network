'Value for money': Climate change minister Greg Barker said the aid was a sensible investment which the UK's economy would benefit from

Spending almost £3billion of taxpayers’ money helping developing countries tackle climate change will save ‘British lives’, a minister has claimed.

Each household is committed to contributing £116 to foreign aid projects, such as wind turbines in Africa and greener cattle farming in Colombia, over a four-year period ending in 2015.

Conservative climate change minister Greg Barker said the £2.9billion was a sensible investment which was needed to prevent more ‘failed states’ as a result of ‘dangerous climate change’.

Mr Barker, speaking at the UN climate talks in Doha, Qatar, added that the UK’s economy was well-placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy.

Britain is the only developed nation that has so far publicly committed funds, known as climate aid, over the next three years to help poorer nations adapt to the impact of rising temperatures, such as floods and droughts. The pledge has angered some Tories, who believe the money could be better spent in times of economic hardship at home.

Glyn Davies, Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, said the Government’s spend on climate aid was a ‘complete waste’. He added: ‘Energy costs are impacting on British households and businesses. I think tackling that should be the absolute focus of the Government at the moment, not spending millions supporting wind farms abroad.’

But Mr Barker said: ‘We are extracting value for money [on climate aid]. I think it represents a sensible investment for British people.

‘If we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states, we will see countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change. And, ultimately, we pay the price in British lives.’

Save 'British lives': Support foreign aid projects including greener cattle farming in Colombia mean the UK's economy will be well-placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy, Mr Barker said

The minister warned climate change would
be ‘a very aggravating factor’ that could threaten the future stability
of countries such as Somalia, Eritrea and Afghanistan.

He said growing investment in the 
renewable sector could also benefit Britain economically, adding: ‘These
talks are about making an audacious land-grab for the multi-trillion 
low carbon market for the City of London.’

Britain’s
‘climate aid’ includes more than £100million pledged for renewable 
power generation in Africa, such as wind farms, solar, bio-energy and 
hydroelectric power.

Another
£21million has been pledged to provide better water resources 
management for 18million of the world’s poorest inhabitants.

Britain
is also giving the Colombian government £15million to support ‘low 
carbon agriculture’ by helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
ranching. It aims to save carbon emissions, protect forests and improve 
the livelihoods of farmers.

Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘The problem is sometimes people look at the  numbers rather than looking at the outcomes – the advantages of spending money in this way.

Whether it’s bringing clean energy to Africa, whether it’s preventing the rainforest being chopped down in parts of  Latin America and Asia, these are huge benefits.’

In chaotic UN climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide £6billion a year over three years as ‘fast start finance’. But with this pledge period ending, there has been little in the way of promises for further money to help developing countries grow sustainably and deal with the impacts of climate change.

Oxfam climate change policy adviser Tracy Carty said: ‘The UK has taken a step forward, now we eagerly await other developed nations to follow suit.’
