The luxury yachts in the background might be a bit of a giveaway, but other than that it's the archetypal image of an ordinary doting grandmother surrounded by her smiling grandchildren.

But this relaxed holiday snap in fact features of one of the world's most influential royal families.

Queen Sofia of Spain, 74, is pictured with her daughter Elena, Duchess of Lugo, 49, and daughter-in-law Princess Letizia, 40 and her eight grandchildren.

It seems Queen Sofia is determined to turn her family holiday into a display of love for her grandchildren.

She is considered to be one of the most 
stylish European royals and her wardrobe and immaculate grooming often 
win plaudits from the Spanish press.

But this week, she left her style 
credentials to one side as she was spotted carrying a handbag featuring 
pictures of her eight grandchildren.

The Queens' eldest daughter Infanta Elena has two children Felipe, 15, and Victoria, 12, with ex-husband Jaime de Marichlar.

Informal: The pictures show a more relaxed side to the Royal family

Infanta Cristina has four children: Miguel, 11, Pablo, 12, Juan, 13, and Irene, 8.

And the youngest member of the family Crown Prince Felipe and wife Princes Letizia have two daughters Leonor, 8 and Sofia, 6.

The people of Spain are used to 
seeing pictures of the Queen's beloved grandchildren with the families 
often appearing on the royal family's official Christmas cards and 
Season's Greeting messages.

These candid pictures show the royals in an informal setting, wearing shorts and sunglasses.
