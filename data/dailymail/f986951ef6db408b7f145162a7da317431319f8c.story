CCTV footage of a street brawl allegedly involving Liverpool FC captain Steven Gerrard was seized by an off-duty police officer as a 'as a tool for blackmail', a court heard.

Gerrard was out with friends celebrating his testimonial match at a wine bar in Formby, Merseyside, when trouble flared.

Helen Jones, 33, who worked for Merseyside Police for eight years, was on a career break when she used her warrant card at a bank in Formby to obtain footage of the dispute.

A court today heard how there was an 'irresistible inference' that Jones took the footage on behalf of others intent on blackmailing the Liverpool and England star.

Jones, of Chatham, Kent, has admitted misconduct at Preston Crown Court but the prosecution rejects Jones's account that she was unaware of any criminal purpose behind obtaining the recording. 

Describing the events that were captured on camera on August 4, Richard Haworth, prosecuting, said: 'The professional footballer Steven Gerrard, and it will not need me to remind the court of his position and status, was celebrating his testimonial match on an evening out in Formby with a group of friends at Woodwards Bar in Chapel Lane.

'The group included a man called Lee McPartland. In the course of the late evening there was a dispute between Mr Gerrard's group of friends and another group and it moved out on to Chapel Lane, outside Lloyds Bank where an altercation was captured on CCTV which showed the involvement of a man called Paul Lloyd.

'The Crown's case remains that Mr Gerrard was seeking to avoid any involvement, or any form of aggression or confrontation, and as far as he was concerned was attempting to defuse the situation.'

On August 8, three days later, Jones went to Lloyds Bank on Chapel Lane and asked to speak to the manager, Sharon Allen.

She retrieved the footage after showing her warrant card and telling the bank manager that she was in plain clothes because 'the job I do, no people would talk to me'.

The prosecution said that a phone call made through a Merseyside Police call operator to Lloyds Bank at Jones's request was to 'provide a smokescreen' and 'add authenticity' to her actions.

Mr Haworth added: 'In the weeks that followed Mr Lloyd contacted Mr McPartland and arranged a meeting of the two men.

'Paul Lloyd showed Mr McPartland CCTV of the incident on a laptop, gave his interpretation of the footage and requested Mr McPartland relay this to Mr Gerrard.

'The only copy of the CCTV had been provided to the defendant (Jones). It could not have been obtained by anyone else but the defendant.

'Paul Lloyd said he had been offered a substantial amount of money by the press for his story.'

The court heard that Gerrard's and Liverpool FC's solicitor was later contacted by the head of press at Anfield to say that The Sun newspaper had been provided with a copy of the footage.

Mr Haworth added: 'Whether that is right or wrong is perhaps unimportant ... but it was reported to the police and an investigation got under way as to how the CCTV had passed into the hands, ostensibly, of a civilian. Those enquiries led to the defendant, who by this time was in London, being arrested on October 2, 2013.'

Jones at first denied any knowledge of any of the parties involved, handling the footage or entering the bank. She claimed that she was in Liverpool with her niece on the day the footage was seized.

It was only in September this year, days before her trial was due to begin, that Jones admitted taking the footage, saying she acted out of concern for someone who had claimed to have been assaulted by a group 'that included a well-known individual' who intended to use it for 'civil redress through the courts if necessary'.

She claimed in a defence statement: 'I had been assured that there was no intention to use any evidence criminally. I wasn't made aware that the recording may be offered to the press.'

Jones was due to give evidence later as her defence team argued that she was unaware of any criminal purpose to be carried out by others with the film.

But Mr Haworth added: 'The nature of what's being sought, the individuals who are alleged to have been involved in the incident which took place and the means by which this defendant was asked to obtain the item concerned, gives rise to the inference that ultimately this item would be used as a tool to blackmail parties involved in the incident of August 4.'

Jones was suspended from duty and then resigned in December last year.

The case continues.
