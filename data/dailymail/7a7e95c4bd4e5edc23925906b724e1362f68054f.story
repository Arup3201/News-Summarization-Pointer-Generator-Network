The earning power generated by some university courses is so low and student debt so high that pupils would be better off choosing apprenticeships, new research suggested today(THUR).

Findings showed sharp variations in the graduate earnings premium depending on the university and course chosen.

With student debt now averaging £44,000, industry apprenticeships would be a ‘better deal’ for many pupils than costly degrees, according to the charity behind the study.

The Sutton Trust said some youngsters ‘may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects’.

Industry apprenticeships would be a 'better deal' for many pupils than costly degrees, according to the Sutton Trust

The claim came as the trust published a new study showing that students who go to Oxford and Cambridge enjoy starting salaries £7,600 higher than counterparts who go to so-called ‘new’ universities.

The Oxbridge premium drops only marginally to £4,760 when the prior A-level grades of students and their social background are taken into account.

Differences by degree subject were found to be even larger, with medicine and dentistry graduates attracting starting salaries £12,200 higher than those who studied design and creative arts.

Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s chairman, said the research showed that ‘not all degrees are created equal’.

The figures underlined the ‘importance of choosing the right degree and course’.

He said: ‘It may not surprise anyone that an Oxbridge graduate on average commands a higher salary than someone from a newer university, but a £7,500 (42 per cent) difference which only falls to just under £5,000 allowing for social background and prior attainment is a bigger difference than many might have expected.

And he added: ‘With debts of £44,000 on average, returns from some degrees may mean going into a good apprenticeship offers a better deal for many students.’

Sir Peter went on: ‘We need to look honestly at the extent to which some young people may be better earning and learning on good apprenticeships than on a degree course with poor prospects.’

He called for ‘many more high level apprenticeships for that to be a real option’.

The research used official data to examine the differences in the starting salaries of recent graduates and their earnings three-and-a-half years after finishing their studies.

It found that the average starting salary for a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge was around £25,600 - £7,600 higher than the equivalent wage for students who went to a ‘new’ university created after 1992.

The Oxbridge earnings premium compared with other, more established universities was smaller but still apparent.

Oxbridge graduates earned £3,300 more than their counterparts who attended other highly-selective British universities, it emerged.

After allowing for their previous achievement and background, Oxbridge graduates still took home £4,760 more than fellow students who went to new universities – and £2,500 more than graduates of other top institutions.

The subjects with the highest earnings premium emerged as medicine and dentistry, engineering and technology, economics, computer science and education.

The lowest salaries were earned by graduates in psychology, English, design and creative arts, biological sciences and history and philosophy.

In a further finding, more evidence was uncovered of the earnings premium enjoyed by private school pupils.

They earned starting salaries £1,350 higher than counterparts from state schools with the same degree from the same university.

Other than this, university tended to act as a ‘social leveller’. Graduates from different backgrounds tended to do equally well after graduation.

Sir Peter said there was ‘no link’ between the cost of a degree and its later value in the job market.

He added: ‘This new research shows how important it is that we enable low and middle income students with the ability to go to Oxbridge and other elite universities to fulfil their potential.

‘With your chances of going to a top university nearly 10 times higher if you come from a rich rather than a poor neighbourhood, it is vital that we redouble our efforts to improve access to these institutions.’

Under reforms in 2012, maximum tuition fees tripled to £9,000-a-year and the available Government-backed loans rose accordingly.

A real interest rate was also applied for the first time and graduates must start repaying once their annual incomes reach £21,000.

Previous research has shown that 73 per cent of graduates will still be paying back their student loans after 30 years.

They will take so long to repay their university loans they will qualify for their debts to be written off after three decades – when most will be at least 52.
