The UC Santa Barbara killer murdered six people May 23, but some of his 50-plus shots also hit and injured a dozen others and one of those survivors has now spoken out about what it was like to live through Elliot Rodger's rampage.

Megan Carloto, 22, was riding her bike to a friend's house that fated Friday when she felt a pain in her thigh and pulled over.

She thought the shots she heard were just fireworks at first, but when the pain hit her, so did an horrific realization.

'That guy tried to f*****g kill me,' she told ANIMAL New York.

Carloto was lucky and didn't even require surgery after the bullet passed through her thigh, but she says the experience has changed her

But Carloto was one of the lucky ones. Unlike Weihan Wang, Cheng Yuan Hong, George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss, she got through the night alive.

'It’s my upper thigh. It’s across the top,' she told ANIMAL. 'There are two holes because the bullet went through the top of my thigh. It didn’t hit a bone. It didn’t hit an artery. No surgery, no stitches.'

Carloto describes the next few minutes and hours as a battle to come to terms with what had happened, who had perished and how she and her flesh wound fit into the horrible scheme of things.

'I watched Elliot Rodger’s YouTube video a couple hours later. That was the moment when I realized someone tried to kill me.

Horror: Carloto was riding her bike that fated Friday night when she felt a pain in her leg and it slowly dawned on her that she'd been shot

'He pulled over his car and pointed at me and shot. I thought I was caught in the crossfire. And it turns out he saw me, pulled over, and shot at me.'

As the mourning for the slain continues and Carloto moves on from the experience, she's taking away two things from the experience: the convictions that gun laws must change and that women can no longer be victimized for not returning the advances of men.

'We’re not obligated to fulfill this male desire,' she says. 'And it angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic.'

While she knows that small changes to gun legislation won't prevent the next Elliot Rodger, she Carloto questions the wisdom of doing nothing at all.

'I’m not gonna snap my fingers and make everything perfect and one law is not gonna make everything perfect. But at least try. Try something. It’s not gonna hurt,' she says. 'It's just two holes. In and out.'

'It angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic that he felt that he should kill people who don¿t wanna have sex with him,' says Carloto
