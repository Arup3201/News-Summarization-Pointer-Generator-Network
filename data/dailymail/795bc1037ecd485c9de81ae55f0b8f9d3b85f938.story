The father of Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic broke the nose of his son's training partner after headbutting him in the face, a court has heard.

John Tomic, a former taxi driver who now
coaches his son, is accused of inflicting causing bodily harm to his son practice partner Thomas Drouet during a row on Saturday.

Both men appeared at court in Madrid today where Mr Drouet was seen with a large 
dressing fixed to his nose with white surgical tape and a neck support.

Tomic, who claims he was acting in self-defence, appeared unscathed apart from a small cut above his right 
eye.

The pair sat about 15 metres apart outside the courtroom before Tomic insisted he acted in self-defence during a brief hearing. A further court appearance has been scheduled for May 14.

The incident, which the Association 
of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Tennis Australia (TA) are 
investigating, took place on Madrid's central Paseo de la Castellana 
street on Saturday and Tomic was later taken into custody at his hotel, 
police said.

He
was ordered to appear in court and could be handed a prison sentence of
up to three years and  fined if found guilty.

'I don't feel guilty, I didn't do anything wrong,' a weary-looking Tomic, whose light blue shirt had sweat circles under the armpits, told reporters after the hearing.

Returning home: Drouet will now return to his home in France before the next hearing on May 14

Asked if he was worried about being thrown off the Tour, he said: 'No I just said I didn't do anything wrong.'

He
declined to comment further and left the court by a side entrance to 
avoid the reporters and television cameras waiting in the street.

A subdued Drouet, who will return to his home in France before coming back for the May 14 hearing, was reluctant to discuss the details of the incident as he left the court.

He said he would consider maintaining his working relationship with world No 53 Bernard Tomic as long as the father was not on the team.

Australia's Herald Sun newspaper quoted Drouet as saying that Tomic had treated him like a 'dog' for years and that he had punched his son in the mouth at a training session last week, leaving him in tears.

Shortly before the headbutting incident, John Tomic had told him he was sacked and would not be getting paid.

'I thought he was going to say sorry for the verbal abuse, but no,' Drouet told the paper.

'He spat in my face, then walked away, and said he wouldn't pay me any more.

'I said, "OK, John, you are a real man. That's fine. Bernard will pay me". And he head-butted me.'

Tomic's Spanish lawyer, Carmen Dieguez, told reporters that while Tomic did not dispute that he had caused Drouet's injuries he had had no other choice to butt him as Drouet had grabbed him by the arms.

Tension between the pair had been rising for some weeks and it was not the first time they had clashed, she added.

Bernard Tomic, who lost 6-3 6-2 in the first round of the Mutua Madrid Open to Czech Radek Stepanek on Sunday, has long been the great young hope of Australian men's tennis.

Controversial: Tomic has been the great Australian hope for years but has enjoyed his fair share of controversy

However, a lack of consistency over 
the season has kept the 20-year-old's world ranking relatively low 
despite strong showings in grand slam events.

He has also enjoyed his fair share of controversy in his short career, frequently clashing with Australian tennis officialdom.

One of the earliest incidents came 
when his father ordered the then 16-year-old to walk off court at a 
development event in protest at inaction against what he alleged was 
repeated foot-faulting by his opponent.

During
a late-season slump last year, a string of Australian tennis coaches 
suggested Tomic dump his father as coach and work with someone new.

Reacting
to initial reports about the incident, tennis Australia official Todd 
Woodbridge, a former Australian Davis Cup player, said: 'What's 
important for us at Tennis Australia is that this allegation is thrown 
toward John, his dad, and not to Bernard.

'I just want to make sure that everyone 
understands that this is nothing to do with Bernard and his behaviour,' 
Woodbridge, TA's head of men's tennis, told 3AW radio.TA later released a statement.

'Obviously media reports regarding an incident in Madrid are very concerning,' it read.

'We are working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
