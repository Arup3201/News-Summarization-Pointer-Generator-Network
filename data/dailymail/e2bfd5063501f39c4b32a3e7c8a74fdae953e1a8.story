If you’re planning to update your iPhone or iPad to the latest iOS 8 software, you may be in for a shock.

Although the update files themselves take up less than 1GB of space, the total software needs between 3GB and 5GB of storage to complete the install, depending on how up-to-date the device is.

This means that if you don’t have enough space on your device, you may need to get rid of photos, videos, files and apps just to make room.

Apple unveiled iOS 8 in June and released it worldwide on Wednesday, and although the size may seem substantial, it is average for mobile software of this kind. 

Design-wise, iOS 8 looks similar to iOS 7, with flat icons and menus.

The search function on Apple’s Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates, or album name.

The Messages app in iOS 8 now lets users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds and music.

The new Messages app also takes on Whatsapp by additionally letting users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time.

Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on an interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll. 

Although the size of the software may seem substantial, it is average for mobile software of this kind. However, if users don’t have enough space on their device, they may need to get rid of photos, videos, files and apps just to make room

Users can upgrade to iOS 8 by opening Settings, General, and Software Update.

If users need to clear space, they can begin by uploading photos and files to iCloud.

If the Photo Stream feature is enabled, there may be duplicate photos in the Camera Roll and iCloud. 

Once the photos are backed up, these duplicates can be removed.

Backups automatically take place when the feature is enabled - in Settings, iCloud, Storage & Backup - and the device is plugged into the mains, and connected to Wi-Fi.

Files can also be transferred to a laptop or PC by connecting the device to the computer.

To delete apps, press and hold the icon on the homescreen and click the cross. 

Apps that are removed from the device are still accessible from iCloud.

Once the software is installed, if there is enough room, users can then re-download any apps they removed.

Be aware that when apps are deleted, typically their data is removed as well, which won’t be recoverable.

In addition to deleting photos and videos, messages equally take up storage space and full, unwanted conversations should be removed to make room.

Clearing cookies used to store data on Apple’s Safari browser will also make space. 

This can be done in Settings, Safari, Clear Cookies and select Data. 

These new features need room on the device, but during the install, Apple also needs somewhere to temporarily store iOS 7 while it is being replaced. 

It also needs room to unpack software files, before compressing them, which means that although the update may need a certain amount of space, the final space it occupies should be less. 

Users can upgrade to the software by opening Settings, General, and selecting Software Update.

If users need to clear space on the device, they can begin by uploading their photos and files to iCloud.

If the Photo Stream feature is enabled, there may be duplicate photos in the Camera Roll and iCloud.

Backups automatically take place when the features is enabled - in Settings, iCloud, Storage & Backup - and the device is plugged into the mains, and connected to Wi-Fi.

Files can also be transferred to a laptop or PC by connecting the phone or tablet, and dragging the photos and contacts, for example, over.

Users can also delete apps, by pressing and holding them from the homescreen and clicking the cross. 

Many apps will be removed from the device, but are still accessible from iCloud.

Once the software is installed, if there is enough room, users can then re-download any apps they removed.

When updating software, Apple advises that backups are carried out as a matter of course, and that the phone is plugged into the mains, and connected to Wi-Fi throughout.

If the battery dies half way through an update, it could cause the phone to crash – and download times vary from between 45 minutes and three hours, depending on how up-to-date the user’s software is.

Apple’s iOS 8 is compatible with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, comes pre-installed on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and is available for the iPad 2, 3rd and 4th-generation iPad, iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad Mini with Retina display.

However, reports in ArsTechnica claim iOS 8 will slow down the iPhone 4S significantly, causing it take almost three seconds longer to boot, for example.

The site found that that an iPhone 4S, running iOS 8, takes almost twice as long to open Apple apps, such as Safari, too, compared to the latest iOS 7.1.2 software.
