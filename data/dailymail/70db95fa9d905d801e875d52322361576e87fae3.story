A four-year-old girl was fighting for her life last night after falling nearly 30ft as she queued for a ride at a theme park.

Jessica Blake was said to have plunged through a gap left by a missing plank in a rope-style bridge leading to the Tomb Blaster ride at Chessington World of Adventures, in Surrey.

The youngster has a fractured skull, fractured ribs and bleeding to the liver and kidneys.

Accident: The girl, four, fell from height while queuing for a ride at Chessington

Her parents, Darren Blake and Sarah 
Archer, who are divorced, are by her side at St George's Hospital in 
Tooting, South London. Her condition is said to be critical.

Jessica's aunt Carly Hyde, from 
Watford, said: 'There were one or two planks missing from the bridge. 
Jessica was walking ahead of her mother and all of a sudden Sarah saw 
her disappear through the gap.

'Our little girl is touch and go at the moment, the doctors have said she has suffered damage to the right side of the brain.

'Their main priority at the moment is to get her through the next 24 hours.

'Her parents are not coping at all, 
she is their whole world. She really is a little angel. The whole family
are in shock and absolutely devastated.'

Only two weeks ago Jessica, who lives with her mother in Sheerness,Â  Kent, was the flower girl at her father's wedding.

Comments from witnesses on the park's Facebook page asking about the girl's condition were allegedly removed.

A statement was then published on the 
same page, which said: 'The circumstances surrounding this sad incident 
are currently under investigation and therefore it is inappropriate to 
comment on this further.

'We have been in regular contact with the family and our thoughts and best wishes are with them at this time.'

Mrs Hyde said the family were 'disgusted' that the comments had been removed.

She said: 'This is a serious incident and people want to know how Jessica is doing.

'And in their statement they've said that they are in constant touch with the family, and that is just not true.'
