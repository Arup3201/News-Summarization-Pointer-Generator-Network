A new mother who went into labor just as July's 4th Hurricane Arthur left her stranded from the nearest hospital, has told her story.

Wendy Garcia was already two weeks overdue with her first child when the treacherous storm - and her labor pains - hit her hometown of Roanoke Island Manteo, North Carolina; forcing the only route to hospital, a main highway overpass, underwater.

'It looked like waves in there,' Mrs Garcia told Today. 'It looked bad.'

Stranded: Wendy Garcia, already two weeks overdue, went into labor just as July 4th's Hurricane Arthur hit her hometown of Roanoke Island Manteo, North Carolina, where she was cut off from the mainland

Perhaps they should have called him North West? Wendy's son Mialan is now two months old

Because she was so overdue, doctors had advised Mrs Garcia to rush to hospital if she felt 'any pains at all,' she told The Outer Banks Voice. 

Her contractions kicked in at 4am on Friday July 4, just as the hurricane was hurtling towards shore from the sea.

'The pains were so bad I couldn't stand it anymore and so my mom decided to drive me to the hospital,' she said.

Once they reached the flooded overpass, which had been blocked by police, an ambulance was called to the scene. As soon as it arrived, however, it was clear amid the howling winds and gushing water that crossing would be impossible.

Flooded: The only route to hospital was a main highway overpass (pictured), which was dangerously waterlogged, and which the ambulance they had summoned couldn't cross

From there, a five-ton 'military-type' truck was summoned, which was just high enough to navigate the waterlogged overpass. Too high, however, for Mrs Garcia to reach; heavily pregnant and standing at only 4ft 11in tall.

In the end, she scaled the back of a first responder and scrambled into the truck, which sped off before she could even tell whether her husband Eduardo had joined her.

He had, and by the time they finally reached the hospital, the story was already circulating and the media had beat them to it.

Happy ending: Mrs Garcia reached hospital safely and after a 14-hour labor, gave birth to Mialan at 6.30am the following morning. Pictured, the truck crossing the overpass (top) and the stranded ambulance (far right)

'The doctor comes in and he's like, "Do you know you're famous?"' Mrs Garcia told Today. 'And I'm like, "why?"'

Mrs Garcia had more important things to concern herself with, of course: the difficult 14-hour labor that lay ahead of her.

Her son Mialan was born at 6.30am on Saturday July 5, weighing in at a healthy 7.7lbs.

'The first time they put him on top of me, he looked at me, and I looked at him, and it was the best part ever,' she recalls.

Mrs Garcia adds that this wasn't Mialan's first brush with bad weather. She had her very first ultrasound the day of a huge January snow storm.

'We’ll have lots of stories to tell him when he’s big about storms and his birth,' she told OuterBanksVoice.

Perhaps they should have called him North West.
