With a trail of light sparkling away in the night sky, are these the images that show Father Christmas is hard at work above Britain on his busiest night of the year?

The long streak of light was spotted in the night sky above London tonight as families were settling in for Christmas Eve.

But although Santa Claus may well have started his deliveries early this year, scientists have another explanation for the display.

Residents in London may be forgiven for thinking the long streak of light in the night sky was Father Christmas delivering presents

Residents across southern England enjoyed the best views of the streak of light - which experts have revealed was the International Space Station passing above.

The man-made satellite appeared as a small dot of light moving across the night sky at about 5.20pm today.

It was only visible for about three minutes, according to the Independent.

Stargazers were told to look to the west at 35 degrees from the horizon.

The newspaper quotes the Met Office as saying 'The space station will be passing over – and it might look like Santa’s sleigh.'

It comes as a major operation was launched earlier today aimed at tracking Santa Claus as he makes his annual delivery of presents.

Hundreds of highly trained experts at NORAD follow the live action on a big screen normally used by the US Air Force

Santa left his top-secret toy factory deep underneath the North Pole several hours ago, with Rudolf leading the reindeer on their trip around the world.

International aircraft have been warned to steer clear of the North Pole as Santa Claus dashes around the world at almost the speed of light.

Central to the tracking operation is the North American Aerospace Defense Command, who have been following Santa's movements from space since 1955.

Before the invention of satellites, ground observers had to try and spot the reindeer-powered sleigh as it shot across the night-time sky.

NORAD is especially busy on Christmas Eve and has brought in volunteers in order to field hundreds of phone calls, emails and tweets from anxious children, wondering what time Santa will arrive.
