If you wanted something to keep you company on a space mission, chances are it would be as cute as this.

Kibo the robot is set to join the crew of the International Space Station this summer - to act as their ‘space buddy’.

He will be sent up with Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and will be able to talk to him in his own language which has been programmed into his circuits.

Scroll down to see Kibo in action

Kibo the space robot has already been tested on a series of zero gravity flights, and will blast off to the International space Station later this year

Kibo will also visit schools and help educate children about space - and is seen here dancing with a group of children before his flight

Kibo will also keep the rest of the crew amused, take pictures and update his Twitter account via a robot brother back on Earth as part of his mission to be a ‘social robot’.

In an oh-so-cute-it-hurts video posted on YouTube, Kibo is put through a zero gravity test in which he floats through the air with his arms and legs waving around.

He also waves and appears at one point to do a little dance.

Another video shows him playing with schoolchildren who smile and copy him as he bends over and flaps his arms.

Kibo is the work of the The Kibo Robot Project and his Japanese maker Dentsu after an appeal by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

Kibo has also been put through his paces on earth in a series of demonstrations revealed today

He is based on the already existing kit called Robi and stands 13.4 inches tall and weighs 2.2lbs.

The language processing technology was contributed by Toyota and Kibo speaks in a synthesized voice.

A camera on his head is fitted with facial recognition software.

Kibo was designed by renowned robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi whose earlier creation EVOLTA climbed a rope to the top of the Grand Canyon.

Kibo’s name was decided after more than 2,400 titles were submitted as part of a competition.

The winners were Kirobo and Mirata, with the latter going to Kibo’s duplicate that will remain on Earth to tell the world what he is doing.

The robot has been unveiled just as billionaire Dennis Tito revealed that he wants to send a married couple to Mars on a 17-month mission.

Should they have Kibo with them, it might lower the risk of them rowing and falling out with each other.
