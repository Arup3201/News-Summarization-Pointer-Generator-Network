Guilty: Silvio Berlusconi committed fraud while he served as Italy's Prime Minister

Silvio Berlusconi committed fraud at his media empire even when he served as prime minister of Italy, a judge has ruled.

The three time Italian premier, 76, was involved in fraud ‘for many years’ and ‘continued despite the public roles assumed.'

He conducted it ‘in the highest possible positions’, an explanation published today for a judgement upholding Berlusconi’s conviction for tax fraud said.

The billionaire politician, who made an extraordinary comeback to take second place in February’s elections, was last October sentenced to four years in jail for his part in deals for TV rights bought by his Mediaset network.

His centre right party is now back in government as part of a coalition.

There was both oral and written evidence that Berlusconi ‘directly managed the first stages of an ‘enormous tax evasion’ scam using offshore companies, the judgement said.

Berlusconi claims that he was not party to any of the fraudulent film-rights deals as he was too busy in his political role.

But in the explanation judges said it was obvious Berlusconi 'remained interested and involved in management decisions, while abandoning the day-to-day operations.'

The one-time Italian leader is set to appeal against the ruling, which also bars him from holding public office for five years.

In Italy sentences for non-violent crimes do not usually take effect until the appeals system has been exhausted. 

But, even if his conviction is upheld by 
the Supreme Court, the centre right leader is, at 76, too old to go to 
jail in Italy, where over 70s usually serve time under house arrest.

At 76, Silvio Berlusconi, pictured last month, is too old to go to jail, despite the ruling that he committed fraud

The ex-premier is also facing a six-year sentence for allegedly paying for sex with an minor in a trial in which the verdict is due next month.

He is also appealing a one-year term for involvement in the publishing an illegal wiretap and accused of paying a Senator to cross benches to bring down the government when in opposition.

Berlusconi has always denied wrongdoing, and says he is the victim of a left wing political conspiracy among the judiciary.

He is attempting to secure a nomination as a life-Senator which would give him political immunity.
