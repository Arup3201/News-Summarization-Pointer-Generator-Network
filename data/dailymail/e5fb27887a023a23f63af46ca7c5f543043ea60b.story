Two engineers were killed when they were dragged onto a conveyor belt while carrying out repairs, an inquest heard today.

James Bibby, 25, and Thomas Elmer, 27, died while working on a 150ft tall silo at the Sonae factory in Kirkby, Merseyside, on December 7, 2010.

Coroner’s officer Lynda Roberts told the jury at Bootle Town Hall: 'It is believed the maintenance work was almost complete when the conveyor belt has started up and both males were dragged into the machinery.'

John Moutrie, a specialist mechanical inspector for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said that the 'tragic incident' occurred while the work was carried out 'without the conveyor belt being isolated'.

He said: 'The conveyor would not have run if the isolator was off and the incident could not have occurred.'

Mr Moutrie questioned the Sonae safety procedures and the 'Permit to Work' which he said outlined how a 'permit issuer' - or staff member responsible for safety - should have checked that machine.

He said the staff member in question was 'apparently not trained' and 'may not have been competent to authorise the permit to work procedure'.

But Mr Moutrie also said that Mr Bibby and Mr Elmer should have checked their own machine and applied isolation 'locks' prior to starting work.

He added: 'In my opinion if it’s an outside contractor working on the site it’s doubly important that it’s inspected by the issuer.'

The inquest heard the conveyor belt had been triggered automatically as factory machinery started to dump wood chips into the silo.

The two men, both from Rossendale, Lancashire, were working on one of four silos - described as the overflow silo - which was used when the three other silos were full up.

The jury was told that prior to the incident both men were 'fit and healthy' and that toxicology tests later confirmed that no alcohol or drugs were found in their systems.

A post mortem examination found that both men died from multiple injuries.

The inquest, heard in front of Merseyside Coroner Christopher Sumner, is expected to continue for around three weeks.

The factory was burnt to the ground in 2011 and Portuguese company Sonae Industria stopped production in September 2012.
