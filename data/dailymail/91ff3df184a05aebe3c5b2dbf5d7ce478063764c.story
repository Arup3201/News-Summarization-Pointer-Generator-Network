Diana Dudas, the British woman swept away in Spain after flooding in town of Vera Almeria

Smiling at the camera for a photo later posted on Facebook, this is the first picture published of Diana
Dudas,  the 'lovely, very warm, very caring' British expat who went missing amid severe flash flooding in Spain.

The 52-year-old was reported missing in the town of Vera, Almeria, after 
torrential rain hit the area - leaving at least 10 others dead.

Her friend Genny Sutcliffe, 56, said Mrs Dudas had a Spanish husband, Javier, and had lived in the country for many years.

She said: 'I was told that her body 
was found washed up in the lagoon. I’m not sure exactly when it was that
she went missing, but the heavy rain started on Thursday night.'

Mrs Sutcliffe said she did not believe Mrs Dudas had any children, but had other family living in the UK.

She had her own holistic therapy clinic and hairdressers in the town and had just written a book.

Mrs
Sutcliffe added: 'She was absolutely lovely, very warm, very caring and
with a great sense of humour. We are absolutely devastated.'

She said her own home had not been affected by the flooding as she lived on higher ground.

Speaking of where Mrs Dudas went missing, she said: 'The devastation in that area is horrendous.

'I saw a house that had a car that had been swept into its front garden and a car in its back garden.

'A lot of people aren’t going to be able to return to their homes for months.'

A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was looking into the incident and liaising with local authorities.

An extensive search was launched for Mrs Dudas after her husband reported her missing.

Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes after torrential rain led to flash flooding in the Andalucian provinces of Malaga, Almeria and Murcia.

She is thought to have vanished during torrential rain on Friday morning as she headed for work at her health salon in Vera.

Dozens of Civil Guard and local police officers as well as civil protection workers have been taking part in a land and sea search, which began at the Vera Beach Club hotel.

It is believed that Ms Dudas has been a practising holistic therapist and reflexologist for more than ten years.

Heavy downpours and resulting high waters and the death toll includes five people in Murcia, three in Almeria and one in Malaga. Five people originally declared missing had been found alive.

Dozens of roads have been closed and two motorway bridges have collapsed.

Jackie Broad, 58, said her home in Mojacar, Almeria, was too high up to be flooded but she had seen cars get washed away by raging torrents of water.

She said: 'The river at the bottom of our road has burst its banks. There was a lot of water, in some places up to the roofs of shops and houses.

'The water has run away now but it's 
left about a foot of mud everywhere. A lot of the roads are closed so 
we're having trouble getting around.'

who have died include two children who were found drowned in a car in 
Puerto Lumbreras in Murcia, Spanish national radio reported

The station also said an elderly man was found dead near the town's cemetery.

The heavy rain started yesterday morning throughout Spain and follows months of drought and soaring summer temperatures which helped trigger thousands of wildfires.

Meanwhile, 35 people were injured when a tornado swept through a fairground and knocked down a Ferris wheel in Valencia last night.

The tornado damaged several rides and cut electricity at the temporary fair set up in the main square of Gandia, according to its town hall website. It said 15 of the injured were seriously hurt, all of whom were treated on site.
