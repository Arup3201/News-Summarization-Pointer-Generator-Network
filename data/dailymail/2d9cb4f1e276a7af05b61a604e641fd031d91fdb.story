The new season may only be just starting, but Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has already provided one of the celebrations of the season.

The Gabonese winger headed home powerfully from a cross to put his side two goals up against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich in the German curtain-raiser, before unleashing one of the great responses to a goal.

Aubameyang produced a spiderman mask from his pocket and pulled it over his head before celebrating with his teammates.

It was a move reminiscent of former-Fulham striker Facundo Sava, who used to remove a zorro mask from his sock after scoring. 

Aubameyang, 25, scored 14 times for Dortmund last season, and will hope to add more goals this year to help fill the whole left by the departure of Robert Lewandowski to their opponents Bayern.

Dortmund ran out 2-0 winners, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan scoring the other goal for Jurgen Klopp's side.
