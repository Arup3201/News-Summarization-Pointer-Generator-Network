Newcastle are continuing to monitor Genk defender Kara Mbodji as they consider a summer transfer.

The versatile 25-year-old was a January target for West Ham, West Bromwich Albion and Celtic after impressing in central defence and midfield for Alex McLeish's club. He also earned glowing reviews for his performances with Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations.

Newcastle want a centre-back and a striker for the summer as they look to strengthen their squad and bring in a new manager with Derby's Steve McClaren still very much in the frame.

Scout Graham Carr has watched Anderlecht's DR Congo centre-back Chancel Mbemba Mangulu also but Mbodji, who is 6ft 4ins tall, has added versatility and come be bought for around £5million.

Scouts from Chelsea and Arsenal have also given Mbodji glowing reports after watching him against Anderlecht last month.

They had originally gone to watch £15m-rated Anderlecht striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, also a Newcastle and Swansea target, but came away impressed by how he was kept quiet by Mbodji.
