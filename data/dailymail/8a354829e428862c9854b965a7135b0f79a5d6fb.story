A couple who knew each other only as penpals in their early teens were reunited after 14 years via OkCupid, and last weekend, they were married.

Piper Goodeve, now 35, and Gabriel Vaughan, 36, started exchanging letters at the suggestion of mutual friends in 1994, when Piper was 14 and living in New Hampshire and Gabriel was 15 and living in Massachusetts. They were both in relationships at the time, only met in person once, but bonded over their shared acting ambitions.

After four years of writing to and fro, the letters stopped. Unbeknownst to them, however, they spent the next 14 years living in parallel; both studied acting in London and then ended up living a mere three blocks from one another in Brooklyn, New York.

As a teen, Piper and Gabriel shared a passion for Shakespeare and a dream to one day be actors, so their friends put them in touch - as was customary before the age of the internet - via pen and paper.

'It was like receiving a letter from a kindred spirit who...just knew what she wanted to do,' Gabriel told The Huffington Post. 'So we could talk the same language right out of the gate and that was really rare.'

The pair enjoyed one brief meeting when Piper went to see Gabriel in a play, The Tempest, at a Massachusetts theater, but four years and some-50 letters later, the pair fell out of touch and went their separate ways.

Or so they thought. In fact, both studied acting in London only a year apart, then moved to Brooklyn, New York, where they lived a few blocks apart, worked as actors and audiobook narrators, and even shared the same voiceover agent.

'We took the same subway every day,' Piper says. 'I would get onto the front of the subway and he would get onto the back. So we never met.'

In 2011, Piper and Gabriel both happened to join OkCupid, Piper reluctantly, and at the urging of her friends.

'This isn't my story,' she recalls thinking to herself. 'This isn't how I'm going to meet the guy I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I just don't think it's how it's supposed to happen to me.'

When Gabriel came across Piper's profile and saw they had a 94per cent match, he was intrigued, but didn't recognize her or her cryptic screen name.

'I wrote to her just like, "Hey, do you want to go on a date?"' he relays. 'And a second later I get a message back and it's like, "Gabe! It’s Piper! It's your penpal!"

Gabriel's screen name was his real name, and Piper's only way of knowing who he was, since they barely knew each other by face. Both were utterly 'shocked' and 'dumbfounded,' but met a few days later for a casual neighborhood date.

That very night, they headed back to Gabriel's apartment, where he quickly rummaged around in the back of his closet and retrieved a purple binder, stamped with 'Piper G,' containing every single one of her letters.

The couple quickly fell in love, and in October 2013, Gabriel proposed to Piper in the garden of the Lord Jeffrey Inn, the Massachusetts theater where they had at met just once all those years ago.

The newlyweds now live together in Brooklyn, and have since discovered they'd shared 'many' mutual friends for years without ever crossing paths.

In the end, when pen and paper failed them, acquaintances never matched them and even geography didn't prevail, it was a computer algorithm that finally brought their relationship back full circle.
