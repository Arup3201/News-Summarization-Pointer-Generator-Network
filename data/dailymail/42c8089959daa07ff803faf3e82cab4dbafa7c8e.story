A California Highway Patrol officer is off the streets as he faces accusations of stealing nude pictures from a DUI suspect's phone and sending them to his own device as the woman was booked into a county jail. 

The unidentified 23-year-old woman who's made the shocking allegations claims officer Sean Harrington went through her phone after she was pulled over on Interstate 680 in August.

She claims she gave him her password so he could find a phone number for her to contact someone about her booking. 

The unidentified 23-year-old woman claims officer Sean Harrington went through her phone and stole nude photos of her while she was being booked in county jail

He sent as many as six images of the young woman to his own cell phone. 

She discovered the invasion of privacy when her iPad, which was synced to the phone by the iCloud service, showed a record of the images being sent to an unknown phone number in the 707 area code during the hours she was in custody. 

Her attorney says that number was later identified as belonging to Harrington's cell phone.  

'She's tremendously distraught,' her attorney, Rick Madsen, told ABC 7. 'We don't know at this point, although we're gratified by the extent of the investigation by the Contra Costa District Attorney's office, the extent to which they've been transmitted, either to other individuals perhaps other law enforcement officers.'

The alleged victim's attorney, Rick Madsen, said a record of the images being sent to Harrington's phone was recorded on her iPad

The district attorney's office will decide whether to press criminal charges once their investigation is complete. 

Harrington is on desk duty while the investigation continues into next week.  

'We've been investigating this for quite some time, the investigation is coming to a conclusion and we expect to make a charging decision this week,' deputy district attorney Barry Grove told The Contra Costa Times News. 

Grove would not comment on the possibility that other officers would be implicated. 

Should Harrington be charged and convicted of a felony he would not longer be able to be employed as a police officer.
