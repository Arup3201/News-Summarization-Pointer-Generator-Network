A letter from Sergeant Bernard Brookes says that German troops wore women's clothes to entertain British soldiers during the Christmas Day truce

Cross-dressing German troops put on a pantomime for British soldiers during the First World War Christmas truce, wearing blouses and skirts they had stolen from a French farmhouse.

Newly-discovered letters from the trenches reveal that British servicemen were entertained by their German foe, who dressed up in women's clothes and caused 'much merriment'.

It has long been known that the enemies set aside their weapons on some parts of the frontline on Christmas Day in 1914 for a game of football, but the letters shed new light on the meeting between the troops.

Former police officer Bob Brooke, 58, from Maybole, South Ayrshire, found the detail in letters his grandfather Bernard sent home from France.

Bernard, 22 at the time he wrote the letters, was a sergeant with the Queen's Westminster Rifles. He survived the war and died in 1962, aged 69.

One letter explains: 'Many of the Germs [sic] had costumes on which had been taken from houses nearby, and one fellow had a blouse, skirt, top hat and umbrella which caused much merriment.'

The troops even exchanged addresses and promised to write to each other at the end of the war if they 'came through safely'.

The 58-year-old said: 'It was the last thing I expected to find,' he said. 

'You can only imagine the men were sick of the death and carnage and were desperate for an escape through entertainment.

'It must have seemed like a pantomime to my granddad and the other British soldiers.'

The full tale is recounted in a new book by Mr Brookes' aunt Una Barrie, called A Signaller's War, with all profits donated to the British Legion.

Soldiers emerged from their trenches along parts of the Western Front and met each other in no man's land on December 25, 1914

WWI historian Alan Cleaver said he had heard rumours of troops dressing up for each other but the letter was the first concrete evidence of it actually happening.

He said: 'I'd heard stories of pantomimes and dressing up on the Western Front but never seen written evidence until now. 

'His account is particularly interesting as it confirms men dressing in fancy dress and women's clothing during the truce.'

Another letter discovered in Scotland tells the story of a German soldier who defected to the British side during the Christmas truce.

A poignant note from Captain John Stansfeld, who was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders, reveals a 100-year-old love story.

His letter says: 'Tonight a German came across and deserted to our side.

'He had been talking to some of Scots Guards on Xmas Day and took advantage of the truce to come right in. 

'He is married to an English girl and lives in Devonshire.' 

Captain Stansfield's great-grandson Edward said: 'We may never know what happened to this young German defector.'
