Liverpool will be hoping to better a record of just two wins in 14 against Arsenal in all competitions when they welcome the Gunners to Anfield for Sunday's vital Premier League clash.

Neither side has enjoyed the first few months of this campaign, with both Brendan Rodgers and Arsene Wenger under increasing pressure to get things right.

After challenging for the title last season, a Luis Suarez-less Liverpool have suffered without their talismanic Uruguayan and England striker Daniel Sturridge, who has been out since the end of August with a combination of thigh and calf problems.

The Gunners have also stuttered so far, with fan frustration reaching boiling point.

However, Anfield has represented a happy hunting ground for Wenger and his side in recent years - getting the better of some thrilling encounters.

Aside from last season's first-half capitulation at Anfield, Wenger has masterminded three wins from his last four visits to Liverpool, with just one solitary defeat at the Emirates the only blot on the copybook for the Frenchman.

That victory in August 2011 was Liverpool's first win at Arsenal in 11 years. Helped by the dismissal of Emmanuel Frimpong, the Reds took full advantage with an Aaron Ramsey own goal and substitute Suarez helping Kenny Dalglish's men earn a crucial three points.

Certainly the most famous clash in those 14 games was the memorable 4-4 draw at Anfield, with forgotten man Andrey Arshavin grabbing all four goals as the Gunners left it very late to snatch a dramatic point. 

The scene of one of the most dramatic moments in footballing history - Michael Thomas' last minute winner which snatched the Division One title in 1989 will always live long in the memory.

But determined to further avenge that encounter and numerous other more recent defeats to the Gunners, coupled with the need for a vital three points to get their season up and running, Liverpool have plenty to spur them on when Arsenal come to town this weekend.
