Three fathers who have taken on the unusual challenge of wearing 33lb pregnancy suits have declared they have new found respect for pregnant mothers.

Jason Bramley, Steve Hanson and Jonny Biggins are taking on the challenge of pregnancy to honour mums in the run-up to Mother's Day.

Appearing on ITV's Lorraine the men complained of trouble sleeping, walking and tying shoe laces.

'It’s the little things that become mammoth tasks - dropping a pen or taking a plug out,' Steven Hanson (left on sofa) alongside Jonny Biggins and Jason Bramley told Lorraine Kelly (far left)

Perched on the sofa with their legs akimbo and hands on their fake babies the men told host Lorraine Kelly about the pain of the last 10 day.

'It's been tough, really tough,' said father-of-one Steven, 46, who came up with the crazy idea to help promote a new personalised Mother's Day book by the threesome's publishing company, The Book Of Everyone.

'It's hard in the morning and hard at night, but the most difficult part  is walking to work,' he said.

'We’re allowed a 15 minute shower. But it’s the little things that become mammoth tasks - dropping a pen or taking a plug out.'

Fellow pregnant dad Johnny added: 'I've given up doing up my tying shoe laces.'

The men, who confirmed that the novelty of having breasts wore off on day one, are ten days into their month-long challenge, which in real life would mean they still have 284 days to go.

'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task,' says Steve, 46, (left) who has a 12-year-old son Saul with his wife Kate

But already the challenge is taking it's toll. ‘On the physical side, carrying this thing around not easy,' said Johnny.

Patting his bump, dad Jason, 44, added: 'And we don’t have all the hormones and everything else going on – just this weight.' 

The publishing directors, are charting the  ups and downs of impending parenthood in an online diary.

Steve, who is married to Kate and has a 12-year-old son, called Saul, said: 'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task.'

The trio are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash

The trio, who are from England but all work at an office in Barcelona, are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash.

Jason, who is a father-of-one mused on day five: 'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs.

'I have a chair in the office with wheels and this is a blessing. I can glide effortlessly across the office to my desired destination.' 

'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' says company director Steve, from Doncaster, pictured on his laptop while wearing the belly

The 'empathy belly' comes complete with fake breasts and weighs two and a half stone - the average weight of a full term baby bump.

It is designed to put pressure on the bladder, stomach and lungs, and cause abdominal distention and the inability to get comfortable.

'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' said company director Steve, from Doncaster.  

'My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' said Steve (pictured in his 'empathy belly')

'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs,' dad-of-one Jason, 44, (pictured) wrote in his diary

'I tried to make a small city out of pillows around my bump. My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' he added.

'They were way too warm and hung on my arm, sending it to sleep and waking me at the same time.'

By day three the constant swinging motion of his belly forced Jonny, 45, from Surrey to visit his local pharmacy and seek medical help.

'I unzipped my jacket, exposing my belly and explaining my predicament to the woman behind the counter,' says Jonny, dad to Enzo, five, and Leo, one.

'I expected her to crack a smile or reel back in shock but she nodded professionally like she's seen it all before, opened a drawer and placed an elastic waist strap on the counter.  

Despite the trials and tribulations caused by faking pregnancy, the Steve, Jonny and Jason said it has made them appreciate what their wives have had to go through

'A few minutes later, with belly strapped firmly in place, I waltzed out of there with a new-found spring in my stride. It was wonderful, I could move again.' 

Yet despite the trials and tribulations just one week in Steve admits to bonding with his 'baby'. 

He told his  diary: 'It seems to be taking on a personality. It has a name, and its name is Bump. I cradle it, pat it, rub it and I just caught myself talking to it while patting it.'

As well as writing down their experiences the dads are also uploading videos of their pregnancy journeys to their online diaries - and all three are looking forward to Mother's Day when they can remove the suits for good.

'Huge respect goes to all you pregnant mums out there. Every single one of you,' said Steve.
