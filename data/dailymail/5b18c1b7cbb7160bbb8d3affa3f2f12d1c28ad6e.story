Mystery still surrounds the 2008 'kidnapping' of a pilot who was subjected to an unclaimed $750,000 ransom bid and whose body has never been found.

More than four years on, the whereabouts of 26-year-old Robert Wiles is still unknown, despite a workmate recently being found guilty of his manslaughter.

His parents, Tom and Pamela, this week revealed for the first time the inside story about their heartbreaking ordeal in a specialÂ 48 Hours Mystery broadcast on CBS.

Missing: Robert Wiles vanished in 2008 and has never been found

Ransom demand: This is the email sent to Tom Wiles demanding $750,000 for the release of his son Robert

They told how they received an anonymous note, signed 'Group X', demanding three quarters of a million dollars on April 3 - two days after Robert vanished.

Convicted: Toby Holt, who was sentenced for the manslaughter of Robert Wiles

They stumped up the cash and tried to drop it off to the supposed abductor, but no-one came to claim it.

Robert, business development manager and pilot at the Lakeland, Florida, branch of Tom's aircraft maintenance firm National Flight Services, was never heard from again.

No further demands were made on the ransom, and his body was never found.

Speaking of the moment they received the note, Tom said: 'I can't imagine anything worse. Somebody has taken one of your children, and is threatening to kill him.

'When I opened the email, it scared the hell out of me. I found the ransom demand from the people who had taken Robert.'

The note said: 'We have Robert, if you
hope to see him alive again, you must follow our instructions without 
deviation! Do not speak about this to anyone, including family.'

There
was a five-day deadline of April 8, and so, after drafting in the FBI, 
Tom, who lived in Toledo, Ohio, set off to Florida.

Hope: Robert Wiles' family offered a $250,000 for any information leading to the discovery of the missing man

He
wired the money to a Florida bank with the idea that he would use it as
bait to entice the abductor. But officers rejected that plan and filled
it with coffee that weighed the same amount as the cash.

They
placed the box, as demanded, in Robert's office. A secret camera was 
set up to record what happened, and armed SWAT teams hid close by. But 
no-one ever came to collect the loot.

It was during this time the FBI turned its attention to Tom, who had separated from Pamela some years earlier and had just reached a deal where she would receive $750,000.

FBI special agent Jim Bucenell told 48 Hours Mystery this information led him to believe that the author of the ransom note was 'very close to this business'.

Tom said he felt, during that time, like a suspect. He said: 'They treated me like one. I was grilled a number of times. I was very angry. You know, 'How could you possibly be looking at me?'

Pamela was also under the spotlight, as was former colleague mechanic Steve Lindsey who had been sacked because of a drink problem.

No-one could understand how Robert, a star athlete in great physical condition who was a keen boater and fisherman and had spent years in military academies, could have vanished so suddenly.

Tom and Pamela, becoming increasingly desperate, offered a $250,000 reward on national television and followed up on tips from psychics who claimed to know the location of their son.

Then came the bombshell, from his barber Janie Bear, that Wiles could still be alive. She said he once told her 'he was frustrated with his life'.

She said Robert had learned his father carried a kidnapping insurance policy and ended their conversation by saying: 'Please don't tell anybody I told you all this'.

But family members say Robert would never be that selfish and the investigation took another turn as officers spoke to Joel Valle, the the owner of another airplane engine repair business.

The pair had been together the day before his disappearance and had come up with a plan to partner their firms with Steve Lindsey to play a key role.

Everything was in place but Tom, who had previously sacked Lindsey, vetoed the proposals. Lindsey went on the run.

In desperation, FBI agents obtained detailed call records of the location of Robert's mobile phone calls and, in turn, CCTV footage of the various toll booths on the Polk Parkway where a call was made from.

Tom was drafted in to look at the tapes and quickly spotted the car of Toby Holt, his 42-year-old operations manager, who passed through the toll booth with his right arm and hand close to his ear.

But, according to Holt's own phone records, his mobile was not in use as he went through the toll. He then became a prime suspect, was called in for questioning and could not provide an alibi for his whereabouts that evening.

The FBI discovered he had several mistresses, outside his marriage to wife Beverly. But there was no DNA, blood or forensic proof to link him to the crime. The trail had gone cold. Then, in March 2009, the FBI called in reinforcements to 'systematically' go back over the case.

They soon realised that 'Toby Holt's phone and Robert Wiles' phones were seemingly synchronised' meaning that, in the tollbooth photograph, Holt was using Wiles' phone.

Bucenell said: 'When you put them together - the pieces of the puzzle - it's - it's a very strong circumstantial case.' Holt was arrested on December 18, 2009, at Orlando International Airport after a flight from Bogota, Colombia.

Toby Holt, whose real first name is Stobert, denied the charges of extortion, kidnapping and murder of Robert Wiles and languished in a Florida jail for two years.

Then, in January 2012, he stood trial. Defence lawyers said there was no evidence and pointed the finger at Steve Lindsey, who in fact died of lung cancer in 2009.

But prosecutors said that 'too many coincidences is not a coincidence' and that Holt's unexplained whereabouts for over four hours the night Robert disappeared was key. They also said Holt repeatedly used Wiles' phone, even using it to send the ransom demand to his father.

Holt was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently scheduled for release in 2039 when he will be 72-years-old. He is appealing his conviction based on insufficient evidence.

Tom Wiles told the court following the verdict: 'Keep this man off the street, and maybe someway, somehow, somewhere he'll decide to tell us where, what he did - what he did with Robert.

'We have a son. We don't know where he is. We wanna bring him home. I wanna know where my son is.' Pamela added: 'I'd give anything for - to hear him again. Just to touch him again.'
