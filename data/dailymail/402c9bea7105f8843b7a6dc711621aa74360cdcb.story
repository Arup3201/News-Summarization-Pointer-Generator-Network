Traditional treat: Brits are losing their appetite for flapjacks

It was once a popular teatime treat but now the British flapjack is dying out in favour of cereal bars and U.S-style muffins and cupcakes.

New industry figures show UK sales of flapjacks slumped by 23 per cent between 2011 and last year.

The fall comes despite the Mary Berry-inspired baking boom that has helped buoy sales of rival products from Victoria sponges to individually wrapped cake slices and bars.

And while flapjack sales flop, those of muffins have almost doubled over the same period, said market analysts Mintel.

Flapjacks are one of the oldest and most traditional of British favourites, even getting a mention in Shakespeare's play, Pericles, where it is referred to as an after dinner treat.

'Come, thou shalt go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome,' the Bard wrote.

But Britons are losing their taste for it, even though other similar products are selling, quite literally, like hot cakes fuelled partly by the popularity of BBC's Great British Bake-Off.

According to Mintel, overall sales of off the shelf (rather than home cooked or sold in a cafe or coffee shop) cakes went up 11 per cent from 219 million kg in 2011 to 244 million kg last year.

In terms of value, the rise was just two per cent, to £847 million. But this is partly due to a fall in previously record prices for commodities like grain which has reduced retail prices.

The biggest increase was a 99 per 
cent volume sales rise for shop bought muffins, up from 20 million kg 
sold in 2011 to 39 million last year, said Mintel.

Individual
cake slices, such as those sold by brands including Mr Kipling, saw a 
21 per cent volume rise from 29 million kg to 35 million kg in the same 
period.

There was also a 20 per cent rise for cake bars, like those made by brands including McVitie's, as volume sales increases from 10 million kg to 12 million kg.

Sweet temptation: Cupcakes and muffins are profiting from being fashionable tea break snacks

Whole cakes and small, individual cakes such as cupcakes both saw rises, as did old fashioned malt loafs. Mini rolls and tart sales were static.

Mintel said flapjacks floundering because they lack big brand support and 'sit awkwardly' between being a wholesome product made from oats yet are also unhealthy because they're high in fat.

A spokesman said: 'Devoid of big brand support and encumbered with a recipe that sits awkwardly between wholesomeness and indulgence - and yet is outstanding in neither - flapjacks appear to be floundering in a middle ground.

'After all, you have to go back to the Bard himself for their last notable marketing moment.'

Cereal bars have prospered as an energy-rich alternative to flapjacks and some other forms of individually wrapped cakes, said Mintel.

And cupcakes and muffins were profiting from being fashionable tea break treats, which flapjacks were not.

Mintel added: 'In the 12 months to January 2013, volume sales of flapjacks nosedived. This is particularly dismal considering the total cake category enjoyed an 11 per cent market jump in the same period.

'It's likely that flapjacks have been hit by the rise in prominence of cereal bars. Many of them too have a basic composition of oats or other grains, honey and occasional fruit, similar to flapjacks, yet have clearer associations with healthiness, wholesomeness and on-the-go snacking.'
