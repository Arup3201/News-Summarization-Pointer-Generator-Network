From the moment the father of Bowe Bergdahl took the stage with President Barack Obama, it was clear the Bergdahls were not an average US military family.

Sporting a long, bushy beard that he refused to trim since his son went missing in 2009, Bob Bergdahl spoke Pashto, Afghanistan's main language, and also a few words of Arabic at the White House press conference announcing his son's release.

Some critics of the deal to free the only remaining American prisoner of war have shifted their attention to Mr Bergdahl and his controversial statements. 

Just a few days before his son was 
released in a trade for five Guantanamo detainees, Mr Bergdalh tweeted 
at a Taliban spokesman saying, 'I am still working to free all 
Guantanamo prisoners.'

'God will repay for the death of every Afghan child, ameen.'

This tweet, which was later deleted, has drawn the ire of some conservative activists, who say it is evidence of possible 'Stockholm Syndrome' or a coverup

The tweet was later deleted, but not before it was spotted by several conservative activists. Some are raising questions about Mr Bergdalh's loyalties - possibly even converting to Islam. He has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and Gitmo. 

'Folks, this is either a very bad case of Stockholm Syndrome or something far more nefarious is at stake,' wrote former Republican Congressman Allen West, who labeled the message a 'smoking gun.'

'Regardless, there is more to this than meets the eye of Obama making a unilateral decision and announcement on a Saturday - when he believes no one is watching.'

Supporters see a man who has done everything he could raise awareness of his son's five years in enemy captivity and project any image that might be likely to keep Bowe alive.

In a video posted by the Guardian, Mr Bergdahl told photographer Sean Smith: 'I don't work for the military. I don't work for the government. I don't represent the American people. I'm a father who wants his son back.'

Mr Bergdahl's former pastor Bob Henley told the Washington Post that the father began to study radical Islamic politics as a way to understand his son's captors. He grew a beard to mark the time his son was gone - but also, possibly - to win some sympathy from the Taliban who held Bowe.

Before Bowe was captures, Mr Bergdahl was best known as the town's UPS deliveryman.

It all changed when Bowe was taken by the Taliban. Friends say he delved deeply into his studies of the country and the people who were holding his son.

Some wondered aloud whether he had crossed a line, the Post reports.

Robert Bergdahl also got criticism for this tweet, in which he called democracy a 'cult'

A spokesman for the family told the Washington Post that that Bergdahls acknowledged that the tweet about the deaths of Afghan children being avenged was sent and then deleted, but did not offer a further explanation.

Some activists have picked up on other tweets from Mr Bergdahl, as well. 

In March, he wrote, '"Democracy" is a cult in the West' in response to a comment about the Afghan elections.

He also raised eyebrows when, in a pres conference, he said the family's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, 'We're so much like Afghanistan.'

In a 2011 video message to Bowe's captors, Mr Bergdahl said: 'Strangely to some we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years.

'We know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home.'

Idyllic? This is the beautiful homestead of Bob and Jani Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho. The Bergdahls hope Bowe will return here to a hero's welcome. But what were the circumstances of his release?

The Idaho-native Bergdahls were unlike many military families - or unlike many other families - well before Bowe was captures.

The Bergdahls are Presbyterian. The Daily Telegraph reports that Bob and Jami are still  seen at church in town. They home-schooled Bowe for six hours a day.

They also reportedly traveled 300 miles to attend an Orthodox Presbyterian church in Boise for a time.

Bowe took ballet, but could also ride a horse and shoot a rifle by age 5.

Mr Smith, the Guardian journalist who followed Bowe in Afghanistan before his capture and late spent time with his father, said Mr Bergdahl became political out of necessity after his son fell into Taliban hands.

'I don’t think he had all the opinions at the beginning that he had at the end. I think his thinking has changed,' he said.

'He was trying to understand. It’s not a question of agreeing with people. It’s a question, from his point of view, of trying to understand where they may be coming from.'

In a Rolling Stone magazine article last year, Mr Bergdahl said he kept in contact with a Taliban source who claimed to know where his son was.

He also said he had learned a great deal about Afghan politics. He learned to speak a few words of Pashto and Arabic so he could record a 2011 video message to his son's captors.
