Dr Karl Kruszelnicki boogies on down at Kanye West's final concert in Sydney on Saturday night

He may know how the answer to most things that come his way but one thing Dr Karl Kruszelnicki does not have the answers to is the science of dance - and boy don't we know it.

But the  Australian science commentator and author, best known for his segment, Morning with Zan on radio station Triple J has been excused for his daggy dance moves paired with a loud outfit choice at Kanye West's final performance in Sydney on Saturday night. 

As he bobs  without rhythm, beating his hands in the air and singing to Kanye West's 'Run This Town' you can not help but smile at that precious moment of him in his element, letting go of all inhibition as the music took control.

Standing in a crowd of youngsters, Dr Karl dressed in bright yellow pants and a loudly patterned top that would be sure to give anyone a headache if they stared long enough, looked like he was having the time of his life in a video received by Pedestrian TV. 

Who would have thought Dr Karl was such a fan of Kanye West... Or maybe he was just trying to steal Kim Kardashian's attention through his own science of dance.

He may have all the answers to the questions but one things for sure, he does not have the answer to dance
