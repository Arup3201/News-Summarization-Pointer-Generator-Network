The father of six children who died in a house fire broke down in tears yesterday as police confirmed an arsonist started the blaze.

In dramatic scenes, Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead, 31, wept uncontrollably as officers described how petrol had been poured through the family’s letterbox and set alight.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers John, nine, Jack, seven,  Jessie, six, and Jayden, five, all perished as flames and smoke engulfed their council house  in Derby.

Mick and Mairead Philpott, the parents of six children that died following a fire at their home in Derby have had the murder charges dropped against them

Mr Philpott thanked fire crews for their efforts to save his children. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill (right) confirmed that an arsonist poured petrol through the letterbox in the front door of the the house

Their 13-year-old brother Duwayne died of his injuries in hospital over the weekend with his parents at his bedside.

Police are yet to establish who started the fire or what their motive was but said yesterday they were ruling no one out.

One line of inquiry is that the family was targeted because of its ‘celebrity status’.

Mr Philpott, a father of 17 children by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house to share with his wife, his girlfriend Lisa, and eight of  his offspring.

When asked if Mr and Mrs  Philpott would be quizzed as  suspects, officers refused to comment.Appearing at a press conference yesterday, Mr Philpott, 54, repeatedly broke down in tears while describing the events of last Thursday night and thanking the authorities for their efforts in trying to save his children.

Mr and Mrs Philpott are believed to have been sleeping downstairs when petrol was poured through the letterbox of their three-bedroom council house and ignited with a match or a cigarette lighter.

The fire then funnelled upstairs, with smoke filling the rooms where the children were sleeping. Mr and Mrs Philpott were woken by a smoke alarm but ‘valiant’ attempts to save the children were unsuccessful.

Sixth victim: Duwayne Philpott, 13, died in hospital after his parents made the difficult decision to turn his life support machine off

Mr Philpott said: ‘I want to thank my three eldest children because they have helped us cope. And then there’s a young lad who tried to get in the house the same as myself.

‘Then of course there is the four firemen, the police, the ambulances, the doctors and nurses – everybody who tried to help save our children.

‘We can’t express our gratitude enough. It’s not just us that have suffered, it’s them as well – it’s everybody.’

Mr Philpott said that his son Duwayne’s organs had been donated to save the life of another child.

‘That makes us happy and it takes a bit of the pain away,’ he added.

‘We grew up in a community that’s been through a lot of problems with violence and to see this community come together like it has, it’s too overwhelming.

'Those poor gentlemen from the fire  brigade, who saw what we saw – my heart goes out to them.’

Steve Cotterill, Assistant Chief Constable at Derbyshire Police, said: ‘The seat of the fire was inside the front door below the letterbox and there are clear indications petrol was used as an accelerant to light the fire.

Grief: Mick Philpott holds his wife Mairead yesterday at the derby Conference Centre as he issued an appeal for the public to help police find the people who started the fire which claimed the lives of six of his children

‘The consequence was the fire took hold and smoke went upstairs to where the children were sleeping.

‘Tragically, those children died of smoke inhalation.’

Mr Cotterill added that authorities were ‘not ruling anybody out’ as suspects.

Crime scene: The blaze broke out at the house in Allenton, Derby, at around 3.45am last Friday

Mr and Mrs Philpott are yet to be questioned fully because it would have been ‘utterly inappropriate’ so soon after the tragedy, he said.

Mr Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis, 28, and her brother-in-law Ian Cousins, 38, had  been arrested on suspicion of murder before being released without charge.

Miss Willis shared the home in Allenton with Mr and Mrs Philpott until they fell out two months ago. She is in a custody battle with Mr Philpott over their five children.

Mr Philpott also praised members of the local community for their 'overwhelming' support since the tragedy
