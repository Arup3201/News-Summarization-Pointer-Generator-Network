Brittany Maynard does not have a death wish, but she wants to be the one calling the shots when it comes to the time and manner of her passing - not her terminal cancer.

At age 29, Maynard was filled with bright hopes for the future: starting a family with her newlywed husband, traveling and going on mountain-climbing adventures with her friends.

But on January 1, 2014, everything changed: doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain.

Devastating news: Brittany Maynard, pictured left and right with her newlywed husband, Dan Diaz, learned this past January that she is dying from brain cancer  

Doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor

Silent killer: The 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma - an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain 

Hopes dashed: The young couple were thinking of starting a family when the awful diagnosis came 

At first, Brittany was given 5-10 years to live, but then in April Maynard was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma, which will likely take her life within six months.

Maynard, a vivacious young woman described by her mother as precocious and larger than life, decided then and there to take her life, or whatever was left of it, into her own hands.

On Monday, Mrs Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states.

In order to have the option of ending her life on her own terms, Maynard, her husband, Dan Diaz, and her parents moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, which has a death-with-dignity legislation on the books.

On November 1, Maynard plans to take a pill given to her by her doctors and painlessly fade away surrounded by her loved ones in her and Dan's bedroom, with her favorite music playing in the background.

Painless death: Maynard and her family moved to Oregon - one of five states with death-with-dignity laws - where doctors prescribed her pills that would help her end her life without any suffering

But Brittany Maynard wants everyone to know: what she is planning to do is not a suicide.

‘There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die,’ she told People Magazine in an exclusive interview. ‘I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.’

The 29-year-old Portland resident said she decided on this course of action after hearing from her doctors what would happen to her body in the final stages of her illness.

‘I can’t even tell you the amount of relief that it provided me to know that I don’t have to die the way it’s been described to me that my brain tumor would take me on its own,’ Maynard says in the YouTube video.

Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives.

Bucket list: Since her devastating diagnosis, Maynard has been traveling around the country with her loved ones, hoping to see as many natural wonders as possible 

Accompanied by her husband and best friend, Maynard had visited Yellowstone National Park and Alaska 

Special day: Brittany decide to go on November 1 so she could celebrate her husband's (right) birthday on October 30 

Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico also allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough.

‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said.

Since her diagnosis, the 29-year-old cancer patient has become an advocate for dying with dignity. 

Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death.

Despite increasing pain, seizures and growing weakness, Maynard has remained active, traveling around the country with her family and best friend to try and visit as many places on her bucket list as possible before November 1 - the day after her husband’s birthday.

So far, Brittany has journeyed to Alaska and took a trip to Yellowstone National Park with husband Dan, but she still hopes to see the Grand Canyon before the end.

Sacred vow: Brittany has made a promise to her mother, Debbie, to meet her in spirit in Machu Pichu, Peru 

She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins.

With less than one month to go before the date chosen by Maynard as her final day on earth, the young woman reminds everyone what is truly important in life.

‘Seize the day, what's important to you, what you care about, what matters,’ she says. ‘Pursue that -forget the rest.’
