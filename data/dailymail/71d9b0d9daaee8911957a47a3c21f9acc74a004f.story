Judd Trump benefited from a first-round walkover on Tuesday when Chinese opponent Rouzi Maimaiti had visa problems, and the Bristolian was largely untroubled on Saturday in what became his opening match as he brushed aside Indian Aditya Mehta.

The 2011 UK champion won through to the third round by beating Mehta 6-1, highlighted by a century in the fifth frame.

Elsewhere, world champion Mark Selby suffered a shock exit at the hands of world number 62 David Morris.

He will concede top ranking to Robertson or Ding Junhui, and was not altogether surprised by the performance from his opponent.

'I've known him for a few years and I know he dropped off the tour and thought about stopping playing, but I know the potential he has got he should be doing a lot better than he is at the moment' said Selby, after the shock 6-4 defeat. 'He showed what a good player he is out there.'

China's Ding Junhui avoided going the same way as Selby, fending off crowd favourite Jimmy White in winning 6-2.

Three-time UK champion John Higgins joined Ding in the last 32 as the Scot beat Stoke's Jamie Cope.

Higgins has fallen into a trough of frustrating form in recent seasons, but breaks of 80, 97 and 69, twice, in a 6-4 win showed some of the old magic lingers in the Wishaw man's cue.

Glaswegian world number 84 Fraser Patrick had a break of 139 in a decent 6-4 win over Welshman Ryan Day and Hong Kong's Marco Fu made three centuries in an impressive 6-1 victory over China's Lyu Haotian.

Carmarthen's Matthew Stevens, who beat Stephen Hendry in the 2003 UK final, saw off Kent-based Northern Irishman Gerard Greene 6-3. Greene had a 139 break in the opening frame, which means he and Patrick are early pace-setters in the battle for the tournament's £10,000 top-break prize.

And finally, two-time former champion Mark Williams beat Jimmy Robertson 6-0.
