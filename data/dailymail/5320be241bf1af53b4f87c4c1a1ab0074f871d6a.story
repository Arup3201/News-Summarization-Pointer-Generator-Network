On the up: The Queen's income will receive a boost next year after record profits from her lucrative Crown Estate property empire

The Queen’s income will receive a boost next year after record profits from her lucrative Crown Estate property empire.

Controversial changes made last year tying Royal Family funding to Crown Estate profits means the Queen and royal household will be entitled to a 16 per cent hike in their official duties grant - to £36million from next April, up from £31million this year.

The rise follows the Government’s move last year to scrap the Civil List and link funding for the royals to profits from the Crown Estate, as part of a new sovereign grant.

The royal household is entitled to 15 per cent of profits from the Crown Estate - which belongs to the nation and includes a host of historic properties, such as Regent Street in the West End of London, Windsor Park, Royal Ascot and most of Britain’s coastline.

Figures for the Crown Estate reveal the portfolio enjoyed the best performance in its history, with profits rising to £240million in the year to March 31 from £231million the year before.

Previously, all profits from the Crown Estate went to the Treasury and the taxpayer - a historic arrangement dating back to 1760.

Over the last ten years, the portfolio has contributed £2billion to the Treasury.

Campaign group Republic said it was 'disgraceful' that 15 per cent of Crown estate profits went to the royal household.

Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said: 'This is more evidence that the whole funding arrangement needs to be reformed and put on a proper footing.'

He added: 'The Crown Estate doesn’t belong to the Queen, it belongs to the country.'

A
Treasury spokesman said it was up to the royal household to spend the 
grant 'prudently' and stressed any money not spent would go towards a 
reserve to cope with unexpected costs and dips in revenue.

While there is no cap on cash received 
from Crown Estate profits, the Treasury has set a cap to ensure the 
reserve does not exceed half the sovereign grant in that year.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Royal Household is absolutely committed to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, having already reduced expenditure by a fifth over five years.

'The sovereign grant is a simpler, more transparent way of funding the monarchy and is, of course, now open to scrutiny by the National Audit Office.'

Figures on royal household spending are due out on July 2.

It is thought some of the income from the sovereign grant will be used to clear a backlog of repairs to the Royal palaces, thought to total more than £32million.

The Crown Estate’s annual results showed its capital value passed the £8billion milestone for the first time, up 11 per cent in the year.

Total return last year was 16.8 per cent, far higher than the industry benchmark of 10.4 per cent, and the value of its properties was £7.6billion after a 7.4 per cent hike in the past year.
