The death toll from a powerful cyclone which battered India's eastern coastline rose to 24 today, as the storm weakened and moved inland, leaving a swathe of destruction and triggering fears heavy rains would bring flash floods.

Packing wind speeds of over 120 mph, Cyclone Hudhud hammered the coasts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha states on Sunday, forcing tens of thousands of coastal inhabitants to seek safety in storm shelters.

In the port city of Visakhapatnam, home to two million people, government workers began removing uprooted trees which had blocked roads, restoring snapped power and telecoms lines and clearing up debris including sign boards and corrugated iron roofs ripped off buildings by the strong gusts.

'I do not know how many days it will take to restore my business. I have lost everything,' said Heusikeswa Rao, a trader in Visakhapatnam, as he tried to gather the pieces of wood and metal which once formed his stall.

Huge lines were seen at the few petrol stations which reopened after a two-day closure as people carrying jerry cans jostled to get fuel which was in short supply. Residents also resorted to panic buying items such as milk, candles and kerosene in some places.

Few shops were open and schools and many offices were closed due to poor telecoms and no power for the second day in a row.

Officials in Andhra Pradesh, which reported 21 deaths, said initial surveys found that thousands of houses had been damaged and there was widespread destruction to banana, sugarcane and rice crops in the districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, East Godavari and Vijaynagaram.

Tens of thousands of people spent a third night in cyclone shelters due to damage to their home or a lack of food or clean drinking water in their villages, officials said. 

Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu, who visited Visakhapatnam on Monday, said he was fully confident that response to the disaster would be quick.

'Visakhapatnam is a place I like very much. But, it is painful to see the city this way today,' Naidu told reporters.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would visit the area on Tuesday. 'Have been constantly taking updates on Cyclone Hudhud ... Will visit Visakhapatnam tomorrow and take stock of the situation,' Modi tweeted.

Authorities in Visakhapatnam, locally known as Vizag, said 19 helicopters had been dispatched to drop food and water packets to affected villages. Four naval ships were also being readied to sail to the coast, carrying relief material for 5,000 people, and four more ships were on standby if required.

The relatively low death toll reported so far followed an operation to evacuate more than 150,000 people to minimise the risk to lives from Hudhud - similar in size and power to cyclone Phailin that struck the area exactly a year ago.

According to India's weather office, Hudhud has weakened into a deep depression but is expected to dump heavy rains in northern and northeastern India and, eventually, snow when it reaches the Himalayan mountains.

Aid workers warned the rains were likely to inundate large tracts of farmland, comparing it to Phailin's incessant rains last year which caused major rivers and tributaries to overflow, submerging villages and stranding hundreds of thousands of people for days after the cyclone had passed.

In the coastal fishing village of Mangamaripeta, 15 miles from Visakhapatnam, where scores of thatched homes had been swept away by storm surges, inhabitants waited for aid.

'We do not know how we manage for the next few days,' said N. Bangaramma, housewife and mother of three. 'Our house was damaged. Whatever we had was washed away.'

More than 300 relief camps have been opened to house more than 400,000 residents who were forced to evacuate their homes

Yesterday, television footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.

Four districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people - Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari - were expected to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages.

Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, said that while the early evacuations had saved lives, the cyclone caused 'huge damage' to buildings and crops in the coastal districts.

The cyclone's wind speed dipped to about 100mph, but was expected to pick up later on Sunday. Above, Visakhapatnam is hit

Grewal said 30 diving and 20 rescue teams were on standby. Hundreds of rescuers from India's National Disaster Response Force were also spread out across Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.

India's meteorological department said Sunday afternoon that the cyclone would weaken over the next 12 hours, with wind speeds gradually decreasing. 

But heavy rain was expected to lash Andhra Pradesh and Orissa for another three days. Other parts of central and northeastern India were also expected to see heavy rain.

The Indian Ocean is a cyclone hot spot. Of the 35 deadliest storms in recorded history, 27 have come through the Bay of Bengal - and have landed in either India or Bangladesh. In 1999, a cyclone devastated Orissa's coastline and killed at least 10,000 people.

Cyclone Hudhud struck as Typhoon Vongfong hit Japan's southern islands, injuring at least 31 people. Vongfong made landfall on the southern island of Okinawa and was aiming at the island of Kyushu, where authorities told 150,000 people to evacuate. It is expected to reach Tokyo by Tuesday.  

Strong winds from the storm knocked out power lines and toppled traffic signals and signposts on Sunday, and bullet train service was halted for several hours on Kyushu island. Authorities issued landslide warnings.

West Japan Railway Co., which operates trains in central Japan in the area surrounding the ancient capital of Kyoto, said that some train services would be shut down starting Monday afternoon because of the typhoon, and that the disruptions could continue through Tuesday.

The U.S. military on Okinawa, where last week's typhoon killed three U.S. airmen who were washed out at sea, instructed personnel and their families to remain indoors Sunday until strong winds and rain subsided.
