Her first major hit was The Cinnamon Challenge.

With more than 10 million views, GloZell Green rocketed to YouTube fame by swallowing a ladle-full of ground cinnamon then gagging, retching, spitting and coughing for two and a half minutes.

It is a far cry from her next gig: interviewing President Barack Obama.

Change of scene: GloZell rocketed to YouTube fame by choking on a ladelful of cinnamon, with 10m views

News! This is the moment the LA-based vlogged told her 21 million fans that she will interview Obama

Many expressed surprise at Obama's three planned YouTube interviews after the State of the Union address

After his State Of The Union address on Tuesday, the POTUS has confirmed, he will sit down for interviews with three YouTube stars - including GloZell.

The Los Angeles-based vlogger, who characteristically wears green lipstick, starts each video with 'Hello this is GloZell! Is you ok? Is you? Good, 'cause I wanted to know!'

Most clips, which last around two to seven minutes on average, usually proceed to feature a musical parody or a food-related challenge.

GloZell's 'cereal challenge' sees her fill a bath with milk and cereal before eating the lot.

The 'hot pepper challenge' does what it says on the tin.

And the 'change your eye color with honey challenge' was ultimately unsuccessful.

The Cereal Challenge: For seven minutes, GloZell sat in a bath of milk and cereal while eating it all

Musical parodies: This is a still from her six-part music-less rendition of Nicki Minaj's hit song Anaconda

Hot Pepper Challenge: Millions watched GloZell eat a hot pepper and attempt to overcome the effects on video

The Onion Challenge: Here she attempts not to blink or cry while holding a freshly-cut onion to her face

A monumentally successful performance was a six-part music-less reenactment of Nicki Minaj's hit song Anaconda.

Each skit, dating back to January 2008 has drawn in millions of viewers.

Preparing for her latest role, GloZell implored her viewers for advice.

'I'm so happy I watched all those episodes of Veep!' she screamed at the camera, as she told fans to put their best questions in the comment section.

On that she is keen to ask is what Obama likes on his toast.

Change Your Eye Color With Honey Challenge: This venture was ultimately unsuccessful but reined in viewers

Special edition: Three YouTube stars have been invited to interview the President on their own channels

Number two: Bethany Mota has already achieved mainstream fame with a stint on Dancing With The Stars

'Don't forget to be awesome!': Hank Green and his brother also have a huge following online

A keen Obama supporter, GloZell has been posting supportive videos about the President since he was elected in 2008.

One video was a Marilyn Monroe-esque song titled Happy Inauguration.

Another, told viewers she voted for Obama in support of his healthcare plans.

But while that might be on the agenda, she first wants to know if he's a fan of green lipstick.

The second interviewer will be Bethany Mota, the teenage YouTube star who graced Dancing With The Stars after her 'hauls' (shopping sprees) became a viral sensation.

Finally, the President will sit down with Hank Green - one half of the YouTube duo The Vlog Brothers, who operate under the tag line 'Don't Forget To Be Awesome'.
