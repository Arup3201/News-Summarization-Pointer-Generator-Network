Raffaele Sollecito has said he has unanswered questions about Amanda Knox's behavior after the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007.

In an interview that aired on Italian television, Sollecito said that Knox left his house the morning before Kercher's body was found and when she returned hours later, she seemed 'very agitated'. She said her front door had been broken into and that she had found spots of blood in the bathroom.

'Certainly I asked her questions,' Sollecito said in the interview, which aired in part on the Today show on Monday. 'Why did you take a shower? Why did she spent so much time there?'

The interviewer asked what answers he had to these questions.

Interview: He said he did not know why she took a shower after seeing her house had been broken into

'I don't have answers,' he responded.

NBC legal analyst Lisa Bloom said Sollecito seemed to be distancing himself from Knox - his girlfriend of just a week at the time of the murder - with these latest comments.

'He's saying that there's some evidence that may apply to her that doesn't apply to him,' she said.

Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, for the murder of Kercher in Perugia and served four years before being released in 2011.

Upon her release, Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington and when the case went into retrial last year, she refused to return to Italy.

Fight: Amanda Knox posted this image - saying 'We are innocent' - to Facebook earlier this month

Speaking out: In interviews since she was reconvicted in January, Knox said she will not return to Italy

On January 30, an Italian 
appeals court reconvicted the pair of murdering former roommate Kercher - a ruling the pair are again appealing.

'I am frightened and saddened by this 
unjust verdict,' Knox wrote after the ruling. 'Having been found innocent before, I expected better 
from the Italian justice system.'

Sollecito did appear in court for the appeal and, after they were reconvicted, he was found in a hotel near the Italian border before having his passport revoked.

Earlier this month, Knox denied claims that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance himself from her.

The day after the murder: Both Knox's defense team and the attorneys for Sollecito argued that they were in his apartment on the night of Meredith Kercher's murder

Writing on her blog, she said: 
'It has been claimed that, in this most recent round of closing 
arguments and in interviews since the latest guilty verdict, Raffaele 
and his defense attorneys have finally betrayed their resentment and 
started to put distance between him and me legally and personally.

Victim: Meredith Kercher was found killed in the apartment she shared with Knox in 2007

'This
 is not the case. Actually, Attorney Bongiorno’s closing arguments and 
Raffaele’s latest statements pinpoint and attack a fundamental weakness 
in the prosecution’s case against both Raffaele and me that has been 
ignored for far too long: Raffaele is not a slave.'

She
 added: 'Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against 
me. The only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens 
to be my alibi.'

She said Sollecito had recently e-mailed her backing up her stance.

She
 said he told her: 'I don’t want to be punished for, nor have to 
continue to justify, those things that regard you and not me.

'Obviously
 the evidence demonstrates both of our innocence, but it seems that for 
the judges and the people this objectivity is of no importance.'

Of his role in the case, she said: 'He
 is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible and 
unrelenting scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that
 is "Foxy Knoxy".'

Knox's blog post came as she released a grim portrait of herself on her Twitter feed that shows her holding up a sign declaring her innocence in Italian.

The
 26-year-old is shown in a black-and-white photo, holding a piece of 
paper with the words 'SIAMO INNOCENTI' which translates to 'We are 
innocent'.
