Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Arsenal have won four of their last five Premier League games against Tottenham (two 1-0 wins and two 5-2 wins).

Tottenham have won just one of their last 21 Premier League games away at Arsenal.

Arsenal last failed to score at home to Spurs in the Premier League in November 1998. Since then the Gunners have scored 38 times in 15 games.

Tottenham have conceded six penalties in the Premier League in 2014, only Manchester United have conceded as many.

Tottenham have won just once in their last 21 league games at Arsenal, with Rafael van der Vaart netting for Spurs in their 3-2 victory at the Emirates Stadium in November 2010

Arsenal took 25 points from their 10 London derbies in the Premier League last season (W8 D1 L1) and defeated Crystal Palace on the opening weekend this season.

Six of Tottenham’s seven league points this season have come in London derbies.

If there are four goals in this game then it will become the outright highest scoring fixture in Premier League history (currently 126 goals).

Seven points from five games is Tottenham’s slowest start since gaining just two under Juande Ramos in 2008-09.

Arsenal (154) and Tottenham (125) are first and third respectively for dribbles attempted this season.
