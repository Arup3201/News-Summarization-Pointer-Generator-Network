Locked up: Road rage driver Usman Ali Yasin, 30, has been jailed for 16 weeks after he attacked Patricia Pearson because she was driving too slowly

A thug has been jailed for beating up an elderly woman who told him to watch his language when he swore at her for driving too slowly.

Road rage driver Usman Ali Yasin, 30, left Patricia Pearson, 81, with horrific injuries following the attack in June this year.

She suffered cuts to her forehead, lips and cheek and told police the attack had left her feeling 'vulnerable'.

Yasin claimed that the pensioner attacked him and told officers he had been acting in self-defence.

He was jailed for 16 weeks yesterday after a trial at Burton Magistrates Court found him guilty of common assault.

Jailing
 Yasin, chair of the bench Dorothy Pegg said she and her fellow Justices
 of the Peace felt they had no choice but to impose a custodial 
sentence.

She said: 'For this offence of assault we take in to account the effect that this has had on Mrs Pearson.

'She was once strong-minded but she is now scared and vulnerable and was terrified by the attack.

'The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence is justified.'

The court did not order Yasin, from Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, to pay any costs or compensation to the victim.

Yasin, who had been on bail, looked stunned as two prison officers entered the court room before escorting him in to custody.

Victim: Patricia Pearson, 81, suffered horrific injuries after being slapped by Yasin - who was angry at her for driving too slowly

Painful: Patricia had a swollen lip, lumps on her forehead and cuts on her cheek from the incident

The
 court heard that the fast food delivery driver had become incensed when
 he became stuck behind Mrs Pearson - who had been driving to visit her 
husband in a care home.

He pulled in front of her and braked sharply, before Mrs Pearson got out her car and approached the passenger side of his Peugeot 206.

The court heard she opened the car door and was met with a torrent of abuse from the defendant.

Mrs Pearson leaned in to cover Yasin’s mouth to stop him using foul language towards her, causing him to lash out.

Prosecutor Michael Taylor said: 'The defendant called her a ‘stupid f***ing bitch’ and ‘an old cow’.

'She was incensed by it and leaned in to the car, leaned forward and put the palm of her hand to his face, mouth and nose.'She said "mind your language".

'A witness saw him deliver a back-handed slap to Mrs Pearson which appeared to connect with considerable force.

'Her glasses were thrown 15-20 feet down the road.

'She then felt two scratches down her face which started bleeding.'

The court heard a victim impact 
statement from Mrs Pearson, from Burton-upon-Trent, in which she 
described the devastating effect of the attack.

She said: 'The attack left me feeling scared and vulnerable. I have always been a strong person but was terrified when this man attacked me. There was no need for him to attack me and no way to do so in the way he did.'

The incident occurred on All Saints Road in Burton on June 17 at around 2pm.
