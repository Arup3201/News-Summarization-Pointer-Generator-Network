Lewis Hamilton has vowed not to change his style as he seeks to avoid that 'if only' feeling come the end of the season.

Following the team orders furore during the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, Hamilton remained defiant he had done nothing wrong.

In ignoring instructions to let by Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg on lap 51 - given the two drivers were running different strategies - Hamilton put his own interests first ahead of the team.

On the other hand, Hamilton is not there to hand Rosberg a free pass to this year's championship as he has no doubt he would have finished behind the German in Hungary if he had let him through.

Instead, Hamilton grabbed a stunning third having started in the pit lane after a fire during qualifying wrecked his car, with Rosberg a place further back in fourth, to cut the gap between the two to 11 points.

It was the second astonishing drive from Hamilton in a week, bearing in mind he started 20th in the German Grand Prix and again went on to finish third after a brake-disc failure in qualifying.

Reflecting on his decision in Hungary once the adrenaline had abated, the 29-year-old said: 'It was not about questioning authority, and I don't think I was being ruthless.

'I was not even being bloody minded. I was doing my job and got to the top.

'I am hired to race and bring in points for the team. I am also hired to be me and race my heart out.

'I did not start at the front of the pack. I started from the pit lane, so in my mind I could not afford to lose anything else. I have already given away too much.

'At the end of the year I could be looking back saying 'if only the car did not catch on fire', or 'if only the brakes didn't fail', 'if only I hadn't made a mistake in qualifying', 'if only the engine had not stopped in the race'...all these things.

'So it was just a case of not giving a single point away. I tried my hardest to be ahead and I don't feel as though I was being obligated to help.'
