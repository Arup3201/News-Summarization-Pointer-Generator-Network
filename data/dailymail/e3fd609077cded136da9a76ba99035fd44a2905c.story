Eric Dier has asked Gareth Southgate not to pick him for England Under 21s this month because of concerns about his game.

The Tottenham defender, who has been part of the squad who qualified for next summer’s European Championship, contacted the Under 21 coach before he named his 23-man party for friendlies against Portugal at Burnley and France away on Monday.

Dier, 20, has been playing at right back but sees his future for club and country as a central defender and Southgate said he explained the benefits of staying with Tottenham rather than joining up with England.

Southgate has given it his full blessing and applauded Dier for having the honesty to confront the issue. This, Southgate pointed out, is not a case of a young footballer having no ambition to represent his country.

‘This is an interesting one,’ he said. ‘We had quite a mature conversation about it. He feels there are parts of his game he wants to work at. Long term we both agree he is unlikely to be a full back. So we agreed, for this one, he stayed with Tottenham.

‘It was quite refreshing. It did take me by surprise a little bit. He would have been in the squad and we thought he did well in Croatia (in the play-offs). But I get what he is saying.

'He recognises there are others, like Liam Moore and Ben Gibson, who are playing regularly in that position.

’This game against Portugal will be a dress-rehearsal for Euro 2015, as the two nations have been drawn in Group B, along with Italy and Sweden. England’s preparations for next summer include fixtures next March against Germany and the Czech Republic.

‘We had those games in mind six months ago,’ said Southgate. ‘The idea of going to the Czech Republic is seeing what it will be like to have a base camp and playing good opposition. The Czechs and Germany are two of the teams in the other group so it will be a good test.’
