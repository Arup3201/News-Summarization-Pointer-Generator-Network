Former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett offered to help Gina Rinehart 'in any way' just months before she asked him to convince her daughter - his former girlfriend - to end their legal stoush.

In an email sent by Australia's richest person on November 25, Mrs Rinehart said how great it had been to see Hackett, who dated Bianca Rinehart, again at a university ceremony.

In a reply obtained by The Daily Telegraph, just 20 minutes later, Hackett said how it had been 'wonderful' to see Mrs Rinehart again.

The former swimmer added that he always admired the mining magnate's 'work ethic and resilience' and he had often thought of her and Bianca over the years. 'Please let me know if I can ever assist or help in anyway,' he wrote.

Gina Rinehart is Australia's richest person, but has been embroiled in a long running feud with some of her children over the trust

But as the Rinehart family feud escalated, Mrs Rinehart reached out to Hackett just six months later when she asked him to talk to his former flame Bianca about withdrawing her trustee nomination.

Earlier in the week the Supreme Court heard how Hackett had forwarded the email to Bianca

As part of the hearing into who should beome trustee of the $5 billion trust, the email was evidence tendered to court.

The hearing will determine who controls the 23.4 per cent share of Hancock Prospecting.Â 

On Wednesday, the court heard one-time politician Jeff Kennett declined a position as a trustee of the $5 billion Hancock trust.

Mr Kennett was asked in an October 17, 2013 email sent to Equity Trustees directors whether he was 'known favourably to the (Rinehart) family matriarch'.

'We didn't know what the nature of the association was,' Equity Trustees national manager Stephen Hardy told the NSW Supreme Court. 'Mr Kennett got a call from Gina or someone asking him to do it.'

Mr Kennett declined the offer but emailed that Equity Trustees should apply. 'This would be a wonderful commission if we were able to secure it,' he wrote.

In contrast, his fellow Equity Trustees director Robin Burns was keen.

He proposed to 'be the meat in the family sandwich [and] I jealously ask that the role be kept for me,' the court heard in tendered documents.

Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett was asked to be the trustee of the $5 billion Hancock trust but turned down the role, a Sydney court was told on Wednesday

Lawyer Gary Reardon, whose firm was nominated as trustees by Ginia Rinehart, who has taken her mother's side against her three siblings, gave evidence on Wednesday.

Christopher Withers, lawyer for Bianca Rinehart and her brother John Hancock, accused Mr Reardon of not knowing anything about the trust, despite asking for more than $1 million in fees.

Mr Reardon also wanted to charge $300 per hour for work outside normal duties. He disagreed the fees were excessive.

The court heard he only asked whether the trust's assets were inert and how often the beneficiaries would meet before nominating a $275,000 establishment fee and an $825,000 annual management charge.

'They were the two matters that helped fill in some gaps,' Mr Reardon said.

The court heard the trust paid about $2.1 million annually to the beneficiaries and while he had not managed other trusts worth its $5 billion value, Mr Reardon said he would act 'as a prudent and diligent trustee' if given the job.
