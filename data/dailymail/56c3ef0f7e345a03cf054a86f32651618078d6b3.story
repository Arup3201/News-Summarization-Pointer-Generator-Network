The grief-stricken friend of a murdered teenage girl was jailed today for setting fire to his home so he could be 'with her'.

Devastated Luke Morgan, 22, was so upset by the rape and murder of pregnant Nikitta Grender that he torched his own house in a suicide bid.

Morgan was the best friend of Nikitta, 19, who was raped and murdered by nightclub bouncer Carl Whant.

Cardiff Crown Court was told Morgan was so overcome with 'extreme grief' after the tragedy he set fire to his own home.

He told police: 'I don’t want to be here, I just want to be with Nikitta.'

Whant, 28, was found guilty of murder, rape and destroying Nikitta’s unborn baby Kelsey-May who was due just two weeks after the 2011 tragedy.

The former nightclub bouncer set fire to Nikitta’s home in Newport, south Wales, to cover his tracks.

He was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 35 years in March last year.

when he was alone in the house - but panicked and fled when the blaze 
took hold.

He alerted neighbours, who called the emergency services, but the family dog perished in the smoke-filled house.

Consultant psychologist Dr Angela Phillips said Morgan was suffering with post traumatic stress disorder after Nikitta’s tragic murder.

She said he is undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to deal with anxiety and was on medication for depression.

Morgan, from Newport, south Wales, was jailed for three years after admitting arson and being reckless as to whether life could have been endangered.

Judge David Wynn Morgan ruled that the public’s safety could not be guaranteed if he was released into the community.

Judge Morgan said: 'The offence was committed during a period of extreme grief following the appalling murder of a very close friend.

'This was an extremely serious offence, endangering the lives of those living adjacent to his mother’s property.

'The primary concern of the court is for the public.'
