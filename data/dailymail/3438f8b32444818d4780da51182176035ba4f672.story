War speech: Cofer Black calls on security researchers at the Black Hat hacker conference to prevent further cyber attacks

A former director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Centre has warned of an imminent 'code war' where hackers target technology that runs real-world infrastructure such as power stations and water plants.

Cofer Black pointed to last year's Stuxnet computer worm, which some researcher's think was designed to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, as a sign of things to come.

Hacking, once seen as college prank, has now moved into 'physical destruction of a national resource', he said.

'I don't necessarily understand how this (Stuxnet) was executed, but the important points are that it was really expensive, so a nation-state had to be involved.'

Black was speaking yesterday as IT firm McAfee claimed to have uncovered one of the largest-ever cyber attacks - a five-year campaign which targeted 72 organisations.

Somewhat fittingly, Black's keynote talk at the Black Hat hacker conference at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, was interrupted by real-world alarm and flashing lights.

'Attention, please. Attention, please,' a robotic woman's voice said repeatedly as Black smiled, apparently confused.

'We are currently investigating the alarm signal you are hearing. Please remain calm.'

After a pause and some laughs from the audience, Black kept going.

'This is a very delicate window into our future,' he told the hackers. 'Cold war, global war on terrorism and now you have the code war - which is your war.'

Coincidence? The Black Hat hacker conference, held at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas (pictured), was interrupted by an alarm - just as Mr Black was warning against cyber attacks on real-world targets

It's unclear what caused the alarm - whether it was planned to help make Black's point, was an accident or the result of a hack. 

Security firms, the UN and the International Olympic Committee are among 72 organisations targeted in a five-year campaign of cyber attacks, IT experts McAfee have claimed.

McAfee will not say who it thinks may be responsible, but there is speculation it could be China.

Last month, the Pentagon admitted it lost 24,000 files of sensitive data in March in a cyber attack by a foreign government.

William Lynn, the US deputy secretary of defence, said the data was taken from the computers of a corporate defence contractor. 

He said the US government had a 'pretty good idea' who was responsible, but did not elaborate. Many cyber-attacks in the past have been blamed on China.

But Beijing has always denied any state involvement in cyber-attacks, branding the allegations 'groundless'.

Black Hat is a computer security conference attended by thousands of hackers.

One Black Hat spokeswoman said alarms happen every year at the event, but she's not sure what causes them.

Another said it wasn't a hack.

'With over 6,500 people in here, it's hard to control who pulls the alarm,' Natalia Wodecki wrote in an e-mail.

In any event, Black's siren-punctuated words carry weight, since he's credited with warning the United States government about a September 11-type terrorist attack in August 2001. 

Black recalled the moment he told defense officials about the threat of al Qaeda - and compared that moment to his Black Hat talk.

Officials should be more concerned about a cyber attack, he added.

'People say, "Were you surprised when 9/11 took place?" and I can tell you neither myself nor my people in counterterrorism were surprised at all.

'Instead, it was a strange validation of what we had anticipated had indeed taken place.

'In the technology world, you may face similar issues in the future.'

He left the talk on an optimistic note, calling on security researchers in the audience to work to prevent such attacks.

'We're all in this together - and we're counting on you,' he said.

Black spent 28 years working for the CIA and was appointed director of the agency’s Counterterrorist Centre in 1999 and co-ordinator for counterterrorism for the Department of State.

Is nowhere safe? Even the Pentagon (pictured) was targeted when a foreign government stole 24,000 sensitve files in a hacking attack
