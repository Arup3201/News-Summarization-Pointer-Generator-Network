The father of a Colorado high school gunman who shot dead a 17-year-old girl before taking his own life has posted an obituary for his son on the one-year anniversary of the shooting.

Karl Pierson, 18, stormed Arapahoe High School in Centennial, suburban Denver, with a shotgun, a machete, several homemade bombs and 125 rounds of ammunition on December 13, 2013.

He apparently intended to kill his debate coach, Tracy Murphy, but instead fatally shot fellow student Claire Davis in the head at point-blank range, before turning the gun on himself.

Now, a year to the day of the attack, Karl's father, Mark Pierson, has posted a newspaper obituary for the teenager, saying he wants him remembered as a person 'who lost his way for a moment'.

Happier times: In the obituary in the Denver Post, Mr Pierson (pictured with Karl several years ago) described his late son as 'a young man full of hope and promise who lost his way for a moment, but now is found'

In the obituary, Mr Pierson wrote: 'Karl Pierson walked on to the spirit world December 13, 2013. He was a young man full of hope and promise who lost his way for a moment, but now is found.

'I love you, I miss you, I forgive you.' The message was simply signed off: 'Dad'.

It comes on the same day as a candlelit vigil is being held for Claire, who was described as a 'bright young soul' by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and his wife, Susan, following her death.

Organizers said the victim's father, Michael Davis, is expected to speak during the ceremony.

After Claire's death, the Davis family issued a statement saying 'the grace, laughter and light she brought to this world will not be extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger.'

Speaking to AP, Mr Pierson said he did not mean to disrespect the Davis family by posting the obituary, but said he wanted his son to also be remembered for the good things he did in life.

'I thought this was a nice tribute. He did some things right in his life. Everyone remembers Karl for the last 80 seconds of his life,' he said. 

He added that he decided not to post the obituary in the Denver Post immediately after the shooting because he felt it was not the appropriate time.

Earlier this year, Mr Pierson told the Denver Post that his son was an Eagle Scout with leadership qualities and a lot of potential. He also said Karl had 'the ability to light up a room'.

Following the shooting, Claire was rushed to hospital and placed in a coma. But despite medics' best efforts, she died eight days later. She was surrounded by her family at the time.

Police later revealed that Karl had intended to target Mr Murphy - months after he had already shouted a death threat against the coach in a school hallway.

At the time, school officials did not punish the student. But Mr Murphy was so fearful after the encounter he considered resigning, according to police reports.

Administrators apparently deemed Karl low-risk, despite a threat-assessment that showed a history of violent behavior and angry outbursts.

Tragic: Claire, who is not believed to have been known to Karl, was rushed to hospital and placed in a coma. But despite medics' best efforts, she died eight days later. She was surrounded by her family at the time

The district has declined to comment about the way it responded to the shooting, the threat and Karl's behavioral issues.

Nearly a year later, investigators released portions of the student's diary in which he described himself as 'a psychopath with a superiority complex'

He also indicated he was exacting revenge for being teased in elementary school. He said he planned the attack to start a conversation about teasing.
