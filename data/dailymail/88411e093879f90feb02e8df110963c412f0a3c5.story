Bono performing at Glastonbury: The star has been revealed as an investor in online storage start-up Dropbox

Online storage start-up Dropbox has some high-profile support - U2's Bono and The Edge have personally invested in the company.

Singer and activist Bono has been a high-level investor in tech companies through the private equity firm Elevation Partners, of which he is a co-founder and Managing Director.

Elevation Partners will reap an estimated
 $1.4BN from Facebook's upcoming IPO, providing the social network is 
priced high enough.

The Dropbox investment is the first time Bono has been publicly named as an individual investor in a company.

'Dropbox is excited to welcome Bono 
& The Edge as investors. Thanks for the support and look forward to 
great things,' said the company in a Tweet this week.

The 'cloud' storage start-up was recently valued at $4 billion.

Services such as Dropbox have become 
hugely popular as people increasingly use computers 'on the go' - 
offering simple 'cloud' storage where users can access their files from 
anywhere via apps or web browsers.

Dropbox's CEO Drew Houston reportedly turned down a 'nine figure' offer from Apple for the company.

But Dropbox is now up against serious competition - including a rival service from Google which is to launch shortly, according to insider reports.

Apple
 now offers a similar service, iCloud, which stores music, books, films 
and apps online, and is free to all users of iOS 5, the latest version 
of its mobile operating service.

Google will launch 'GDrive', an online storage service that will store large files online 
instead of in PC hard drives, early in April, according to leaks from sources near the company.

'I am told the big day is sometime 
during the first week of April 2012,' said blogger Om Malik, quoting 
unnamed sources familiar with the company's plans.

Google is rumoured to be on the brink of launching 'GDrive', a service that would offer online storage for digital files - a direct rival to startup Dropbox

The company has long been rumoured to be working on such a service.

Google
 has spoken about launching a 'G Drive' service in the past, but the 
company has been tight-lipped on the subject recently.

Videos, documents and music would be stored remotely in Google's data centres, instead of in individual hard drives.

Google Documents already lets users store 1Gb of files online.
