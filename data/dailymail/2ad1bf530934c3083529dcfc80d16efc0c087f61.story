Hard task: Shares plunged again today after Tesco's Dave Lewis pledged to turn the supermarket around but kept the plan secret

Tesco's shares plunged again this morning after its new boss refused to reveal how he would tackle the biggest crisis in its 95-year history.

The supermarket giant yesterday revealed half-year profits slumped by 91.9 per cent and its £263million accounting scandal was even worse than predicted.

The news triggered another dramatic slump in Tesco shares, which closed down 12p at £1.71, and they have continued to dive-bomb today.

This morning they were available for £1.65 but a year ago they were worth £3.70, meaning Tesco has had £4billion wiped off its stock market value in just 12 months. 

Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality, 

But CEO Dave Lewis yesterday refused to be drawn on what he would do to win back shoppers.

He said: 'Everybody's been saying to me, 'Dave, when are you going to reveal your strategy – when is there going to be an announcement about what you're going to do?' And I won't be doing that because strategies are constantly evolving.

'So, there won't be an announcement of Tesco's new strategy. That will be for me and the management teams only.' 

He did say though he would 'begin the long journey of rebuilding trust and transparency in the business and the brand.”

He added: 'As of today, we draw a line under the accounting issue. We dealt with it completely and then we start again in terms of looking at the business going forward.'

Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent also ran for cover yesterday to try to dodge questions about the crisis.

He raced out of a briefing with journalists amid high emotions and crashing furniture when challenged to defend the 92 per cent slump in profits.

Sir Richard - who quit the company yesterday - denied any wrongdoing or failures before escaping through a door that was then barred by a company minder. 

He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: ‘Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?’

Mr Lewis then told reporters: ‘I don’t think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.’ 

Chief executive Philip Clarke quit in the summer, with Dave Lewis parachuted in last month as the new CEO. Chief finance officer Laurie McIlwee left in April and has only just been replaced.

Tesco is already reeling from the suspension of eight senior executives amid allegations that profits for the first half of the year were artificially inflated by £250million. Yesterday it emerged that the true scale of the black hole was £263million, with the problem dating back to 2012.

Tesco also revealed that pre-tax profits for the six months to August 23 plummeted from £1.39billion last year to just £112million, with like-for-like sales down 4.6 per cent as families switch to budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl.

Sir Richard, 61, who will leave his £625,000-a-year post next year, refused to accept that he or the board had failed, insisting: 'I think the company has been well governed'.

But he added: 'The issues that have come to light over recent weeks are a matter of profound regret.' He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: 'Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?'

Mr Lewis then told reporters: 'I don't think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.'

Tesco also announced that it is suspending multi-million-pound 'golden goodbye' bonuses for Mr Clarke and Mr McIlwee. Mr Clarke was due to receive 18 months' pay – £1.7 million – plus deferred share awards worth up to £5million. Mr McIlwee was due £971,000 pay and deferred share awards of up to £3million.
