Steven Gerrard has never been one for a sugar coating. When he was about to win his 100th cap, he was asked to rate his own international career and gave himself a six before, after a pause, upping it to a seven.

All at sixes and sevens; it sums up 21st Century England, Gerrard’s generation, and they were much the same on Thursday night. They fared no better in the winter chill of Sao Paulo than in the jungle sweat-box of Manaus.

There was in fact less to admire in terms of flair and attacking promise than against Italy. If Roy Hodgson’s team deserve credit for hauling themselves back into the game they were naïve to let it slip again and remain painfully fragile at the back against decent teams.

Outdone: Luis Suarez beats Liverpool team-mate to the ball in Sao Paulo

Looking back: Gerrard and Phil Jagielka can only watch as Suarez's header loops beyond Joe Hart

Gerrard must take his share of 
responsibility as the deepest midfielder — the man who missed his tackle
 in midfield as Luis Suarez opened the scoring and the man under the 
long ball which somehow made its way to Suarez for the winner. The man 
who makes the tactical calls on the field.

If he hoped the World Cup might help erase the agony of Liverpool’s title slip he appears likely to be disappointed.

After
 surviving the early Uruguayan assault, England were beaten by a simple 
long ball down the middle and a very good finish from a very good 
finisher, who somehow escaped the attentions of everyone.

In
 Brazil, England have lost two games they ought to have taken points 
from and, despite flickers of progress, Group D is proving just too 
tough.

At the heart of all this, the 34-year-old skipper is finding it hard to either influence the game or protect his defence.

More
 World Cup heartache; he might be glad it will be his last. By now 
Gerrard knows the routine. There are no excuses and no hiding places, as
 he says himself.

He can be 
his own harshest critic and he is a valuable voice on the state of the 
nation as England face up to the prospect of their first three-game 
World Cup finals since their first, when the tournament was last in 
Brazil in 1950.

Tough times: Gerrard was disappointing for England against Uruguay

VIDEO Uruguay elated as England sit on the brink

In this 
twilight of his career, Gerrard talks with the gravitas of an England 
captain. These days he carries himself like an England captain, chest 
out, full of pride.

He may 
not be a world-class player any more but he has quality. Few could have 
produced the cross from the right when he whipped the ball towards 
Daniel Sturridge.

Gerrard 
has always addressed the ball with style, whether he be shooting or 
spraying passes. He no longer gets to take all the set-pieces but he can
 strike a dead-ball, as he did with the free-kick from which Wayne 
Rooney headed against the bar.

It
 is his defensive acumen which can be questioned, particularly in this 
deeper midfield position where he has settled with club and country over
 the last 18 months.

Gerrard refers to it as the ‘controlling role’ but he has not been able to exert much control against Italy or Uruguay.

Against
 the Italian midfield pass masters he could not get a grip of the game 
and there were similarities last night against an intense and highly 
motivated Uruguayan team.

Holding on: Gerrard tussles with Edinson Cavani as England struggled to thwart Uruguay

As
 England trailed 1-0 with 20 minutes to go, frustration tore through 
Gerrard and he was booked for a late and heavy challenge on Cristian 
Rodriguez.

He was bounced 
off the ball by Suarez early in the game, allowing Uruguay to counter 
quickly. It was a reminder that he lacks a defensive instinct. The 
priority was to ensure Suarez did not escape beyond him with the ball 
but he tried to win it, got out-muscled and England were exposed.

It was not easy.

Uruguay’s
 movement and tempo were excellent. They were inspired by Suarez and the
 tactical tweak by coach Oscar Tabarez to play Nicolas Lodeiro behind 
the strikers, which kept Gerrard and Jordan Henderson occupied.

Gerrard’s conversion is not complete. Perhaps it never will be. His instinct is to play freely and fairly, not to stop others.

Harsh lesson: Gerrard and Gary Cahill trudge off at half-time after a punishing first-half

The
 Barclays Premier League does not cultivate these footballers. The 
speed, physical nature and rapid turnover of possession means the 
all-action heroes thrive — like a young Gerrard, Frank Lampard or Yaya 
Toure.

None of which means 
he should not be in that role. This will be his last World Cup, maybe 
his final major tournament. But if he calls it a day, is there anyone 
better?

Fabio Capello, 
hailing from Italy where these qualities are cherished, always trusted 
Gareth Barry, but there is no going back to Barry or Michael Carrick and
 there is no young heir apparent. Jack Wilshere has lots to prove.

The empty cupboard might prompt Hodgson  to plead with Gerrard to stay on as the Euro 2016 campaign gets rolling.

It has been a soft-spot in the team for some time. Gerrard has helped to mask it.

At times he looks comfortable in there but often he does not, especially against fluent teams like Italy and Uruguay.

It has been laid bare. It is another six. Pause.

Perhaps even a five.
