A young boy from Victoria has written a strong letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott demanding answers on a subject very close to his heart.

Jaden, a 10-year-old from the Melbourne suburb of Berwick, penned a letter to Mr Abbott questioning his stance on same-sex marriage and the reason his mums can't get married.

The letter, originally posted on samesame.com.au, begun with a polite introduction and an admission that Jaden likes to play basketball and 'I am really good at it'. He then gets to the point.

'Anyway, this is why I am writing to you because I want to ask if my parents can get married?' he wrote.

In the letter, the schoolboy also expressed his misunderstanding over why his mums, Emily and Janaha, can't wed. He said he doesn't believe their marriage would hurt the Prime Minister because 'you wouldn't even see them.'

'And dude you sister is a lesbian!' Jaden proclaimed, referring to the PM's sister Christine Forster. 'And if you can except (accept) that I'm sure you can let gay and lesbians get married!'

One of Jaden's mums told Seven News she was 'in shock' when her son chose to pen the letter, but was proud of her son for standing up for what he believes in.

He closed with a sensitive sentiment, writing: 'Thank you for listening and if you let my parents get married then my life and there (their) life would be so much easyer (easier)'.

The letter points out that his mums' marriage wouldn't hurt the PM and that Tony Abbott's sister is a lesbian

Jaden's mums said they were surprised when he decided to write the letter and he did it of his own accord

Jaden then suggested that a positive response to the letter may help Mr Abbott win future elections, and said 'maybe when I'm older I and all the other people will vote for you!'

According to the program Mr Abbott's office has received the letter, but as the Prime Minister is in London he will read and reply to it upon his return.

This is not the first time a young boy has reached out to the Prime Minister to express his wishes that his mums could marry.

An 11-year-old boy who wrote a letter to Tony Abbott earlier this year, called his stance on gay marriage 'pathetic', and revealed he was disappointed by the 'poor response' he received from the Australian Prime Minister.

Jaden finished the letter with an offer for Mr Abbott - if he changed the laws he might just get the schoolboy's vote in the future

He maintained he didn't see how his parents were different to anyone else's, and if they were allowed to wed it would make the family's life easier

Orlando Burcham, from Cessnock north of Sydney, wrote to Tony Abbott in May expressing his passion for gay marriage after his mother Cordelia Troy married her girlfriend last year.

He also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister, Christine Forster, was in a same-sex relationship and asked why the Prime Minister was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country'.

Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter but the 11-year-old was less than impressed.

'When I got it back I was very disappointed because there wasn't any reasons,' Orlando told MailOnline on Thursday. 'It was just a poor response.'

Orlando Burcham's letter to Tony Abbott went viral after it was posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook earlier this year

Copies of Mr Abbott and Orlando's letters went viral after they were posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook in June.

In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum – a member of the Liberal Party and a local Cessnock councillor – had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier.

'You have actually met my mum (Councillor Cordelia Troy) who is a member of the Liberal Party and she was deputy mayor at the time. It is so pathetic that you aren't letting the gay people of Australia and other countries get married here.

'You were elected to represent our country, not yourself. Just because you think it's wrong, does not give you the right to make it illegal. Doesn't our opinions matter to you? Just because you're the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power.'

The Cessnock schoolboy also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister was in a same sex relationship and asked why he was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country'

Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter last Friday but the 11-year-old was less than impressed

Orlando's mum said she had nothing to do with the letter but she had encouraged him to be heard.

'He came in and asked me how to spell "beautiful" and then he came back and asked how to say "pathetic". I thought where is this going?'

Ms Troy said she was rapt with Orlando's letter and the response it has garnered.

'I was pretty emotionally touched. To have one of your kids express something so well and the way he has expressed it is beautiful,' she said. 'It makes me feel really proud as a mum.'

In his response, Mr Abbott said he respected Orlando's views.

The Prime Minister has made his strong stance on marriage clear, despite his sister Christine Forster being in a same sex relationship.

Ms Forster, a City of Sydney Liberal Party councillor, is engaged to her partner of six years Virginia Edwards.
