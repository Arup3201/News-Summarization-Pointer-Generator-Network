Britain's Big Six energy firms are set to make £118 per household despite falling wholesale gas and electricity prices

The average profit that energy firms are making from customers has surged to an all-time high of £118 a household.

This is up by a third on last year and well over double the £49 the companies were making two years ago.

The rise is a direct result of firms failing to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale price they pay for gas and electricity.

The industry regulator Ofgem estimates that the average wholesale cost of gas and electricity is down from £633 per household a year ago to £553 – an £80 drop.

But its figures for household dual-fuel bills show a lower fall of £60, taking them to an average of £1,295 a year – of which nearly 10 per cent is profit.

The Big Six firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, E.on, EDF and Scottish Power – have been able to cash in by keeping their tariffs high during winter. They have announced small reductions of around 5 per cent or less, but this will make little difference to household bills.

The apparent profiteering comes despite the fact that last year was one of the warmest on record and total household consumption of gas and electricity was down by 14 per cent on 2013.

It will add to demands for a shake-up amid claims that suppliers are failing to compete on price and customer service.

The Competition and Markets Authority is asking suppliers to explain why lower wholesale costs have not been passed on and Which? wants a new regime for setting energy prices.

The consumer group suggests regulators should set a fair ‘price to beat’ based on an assessment of costs, and firms would compete to match or undercut it.

Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘Consumers will be questioning why their bills haven’t been slashed further at a time of rising profits and falling wholesale prices. Energy bills are consistently the top consumer concern, so we need the CMA to get to the bottom of whether the price people pay is right. We also need to see simple pricing, and a price to beat that people can trust.’

Citizens Advice said: ‘Low wholesale costs are allowing energy companies to increase profits while barely cutting energy prices.’

Energy companies reject the way Ofgem estimates profits. Lawrence Slade, of the trade body Energy UK, said: ‘Ofgem risks misleading customers by publishing these inaccurate figures every month.’

The firms have suggested part of the blame for high bills should fall on Ed Miliband and his vow to impose a price freeze if Labour wins the election.

Executives suggest they are unwilling to cut prices because they are afraid of being locked into low tariffs that would put their profits at risk.
