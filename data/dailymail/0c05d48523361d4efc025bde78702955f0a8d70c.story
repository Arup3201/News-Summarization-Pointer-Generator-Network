Proudly clutching an array of 'magical' items including feathers, flowers, and even a pipe, these modern-day witches are a far cry from the traditional image of a crone hurling potions into a cauldron.

Wearing anything from a floral blouse to full-on druid robes, these women are among the wiccans, traditional healers, enchantresses and druids photographed by Polish photographer Katarzyna Majak.

In her fascinating series Women Of Power, Ms Majak wanted to celebrate the alternative spiritual paths taken by women in her largely Catholic homeland.

Subjects: Listener Kasia Emilia (left) and Bea (right), who Ms Majak describes as 'the one who listens to the woods',  were among the 29 women featured in the series

Each of the subjects, who were aged between 30 and 80, posed with her preferred talisman, displaying a range of items including daggers, plants, and sticks wrapped in brightly coloured beads and decorated with feathers.

Ms Majak, who has exhibited her images and compiled them for a book, said she embarked on her project after feeling a void in her own life.

She decided she wanted to speak to women who identified with the spirituality of their ancestors who practised paganism, witchcraft and shamanism prior to the introduction of Christianity to Poland.

Her striking portraits aim to turn the stereotypical imagery of witchcraft, and asked what being a witch meant to one of the 
subjects in the series, she replied ‘A witch is a woman of knowledge who
 takes a broom and sweeps to cleanse the world.’

Some of the women have taken a great risk by agreeing to be photographed by Ms Majak, and her collection marked the first time that many of them publicly acknowledged their beliefs or religion.

Among the 29 women Ms Majak spoke to were spiritual healers, or whisperers, from close to the Belarusian border the who combine their religion with superstitions to heal using the power of prayer.

Others had grandmothers who worked as healers or visionaries, and were striving to revive these ancient traditions.

Many of her subjects had even travelled abroad to North
 America, Peru, or New Zealand, learning about traditions in these 
far-flung countries and mixing them with their own knowledge.

Buddhists, Wiccans, Ma-uri followers, Asatrus, Druids and Left Hand Path followers are also represented in the series of photographs.
