A man who shone a laser into the cockpit of police helicopter dazzling the pilot with a light so bright it could have caused it to crash and kill the crew on board has been jailed.

Andrew Paul Holden, 47, was branded 'stupid and selfish' by police officers after he shone the laser beam at the National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter as it flew over Radcliffe in Greater Manchester. 

Images of the bright green light seen by the officers show the dangerous 'bloom effect' it creates - easily dazzling the crew with potential catastrophic consequences.

Officers on the ground were guided to Holden's home in Radcliffe, Bury, by the crew on board the helicopter and were arrested him.  

The helicopter had to abandon the job it had been called out to in Radcliffe because of the incident. 

Holden pleaded guilty to endangering an aircraft and was sentenced to six months in prison.

The incident took place on October 13 last year when the laser was fired into the cockpit. Holden had previously claimed he didn't target the helicopter intentionally.

The pilot on the flight, Captain Robert Grainger, said: 'The consequences of targeting an aircraft can be horrendous.

'During this incident I had to ensure the safety of my passengers, the general public and myself, whilst being disorientated by the intense light.

'Luckily this incident didn't result in any injuries, but it could quite easily have ended in fatalities.

'Sadly, and frustratingly, this is not a one off event. I hope that the sentence handed down reflects the severity of such foolish and reckless actions and will serve as a deterrent to others.'

The helicopter is equipped with technology which makes it able to track individuals and help with search operations. 

Tactical Flight Officer, Pc Andy Shaw, said: 'As a result of one person's stupid and selfish actions we had to stop our original tasking, meaning the valuable resource of the NPAS helicopter was taken away from supporting officers on the ground.

'Fortunately, on this occasion it didn't greatly impact on the incident we were dealing with or have any significant impact on the public, but we could have been involved in an incident whereby someone's life was in danger. 

'Additionally shining a laser into a helicopter could have itself had catastrophic consequences.' 

A number of people have been convicted of targeting police helicopters with laser pens to dazzle them, creating dangerous risks for those on board. 

People who are targeted with the lasers can also suffer eye damage.  

Last October Chris Vowles targeted the National Police Air Service (NPAS) four times with a laser while he was drinking in his garden below the plane with his friends in Birmingham.

Police said shining a laser pen into a cockpit can have potentially fatal consequences for the crew 

Police tracked Vowles using thermal imaging equipment so he could be arrested. 

The 23-year-old TK Maxx worker admitted targeting the helicopter and was sentenced to seven years in prison, suspended for two years. 

And last November 23-year-old William Sprout, from Warrington, was jailed for up to four months after beaming a laser at a police helicopter from the window of his flat.

Police said they take the practice of deliberately targeting helicopters with laser pens very seriously.

The lasers can create a 'bloom effect', with a large burst of light dazzling pilots who are in danger of losing control. 

People have lasers shone into their eyes can suffer eye damage. 

It's not just police helicopters that are targeted with laser pens. In January last year the RAF revealed its planes had been targeted 262 times in five years. 

Some of the incidents reported by the military included people shining the lasers into the cockpits of planes carrying injured personnel.  

The planes were targeted as they descended below 5,000ft on their final approach to Birmingham Airport to take soldiers for treatment at the city's state-of-the-art Queen Elizabeth Hospital. 

RAF officers have warned that the practice plays 'Russian roulette' with the lives of pilots and those on board, while police have warned of the potentially disastrous consequences. 

Aviation officials issued a plea in December for people to stop shining lasers into the eyes of pilots as they prepare to land, after 100 incidents were recorded at Liverpool John Lennon airport in just two years. There were more reports of pilots being targeted at Liverpool than at London Stansted and Edinburgh. 

Shining a laser at an aircraft in flight became a criminal offence in 2010, and carries a fine of up to £2,500.

Recklessly endangering an aircraft is punishable by up to five years in jail.

The pens can be bought for as little as £8.
