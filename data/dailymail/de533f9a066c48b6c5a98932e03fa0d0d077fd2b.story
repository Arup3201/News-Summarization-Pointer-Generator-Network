After watching his American Football team lose on New Years' Eve, a loyal fan's misery was compounded when he fell asleep on the taxi ride home and woke up to a $908 bill.

Joseph Martin had been drinking all day in preparation for the Peach Bowl final between his beloved University of Mississippi and Texas Christian University in Atlanta, Georgia.

He attended one after-party with his sister before jumping in an Uber taxi with some friends thinking they were making an eight mile journey to another.

Joseph woke up over an hour later to discover they were in Alabama, en route to his home in Mississippi -- over 300 miles away.

He claims to have 'crossed the state line twice' and was dropped off at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Peachtree Street in Atlanta.

Bad trip: Joseph Martin's cousin tweeted a picture of $908 being removed from Joseph Martin's account after the fateful New Years' Eve journey

In an interview with Fox Sports, he said: 'I started with mimosas that morning, and we really didn't stop all day. I was with my sister Hannah all day, and she went to a NYE party with me and a few friends. 

'When I left the party, me and a few other people took my sister back to the hotel because she had a flight the next day. I walked my sister up to the room and came back to the Uber. 

'Once I got back, I asked the other members of the car what the address of the after party was that we were supposed to be going to. They said they had already given it to the driver and he confirmed.

'I didn't come out of the party trashed and put my Mississippi address in the system and get a ride home. It was one of the other members of the car that talked to the driver. I assumed they knew the address of the party, which was only about eight to ten miles away.

'I may have dozed off for a bit. My phone woke me up and I didn't realize we had been driving for about an hour and a half. The other three people in the car were also asleep. 

'I woke one of them up and asked where we were going and what address she gave the driver. She told me and the driver the address and when he looked at his phone they didn't match up, obviously.'

Crossed wires: Joseph Martin accidentally entered his home address in Mississipi when entering the taxi in Atlanta, Georgia -- over 300 miles away

Rumours of his New Years' nightmare began to circulate on social media, before his cousin uploaded 'proof' of his disastrous journey.

He later uploaded another picture of the $908  leaving Joseph's account on January 2.

The fee was so large because of the company's 'surge pricing', triggered by the post-game crowds and the fact he had allegedly entered his home address in Mississippi.

Uber allows users to locate its nearby taxi drivers and agree fares on their smartphones. It claims to have worked with Joseph to reduce the overall price.

He has reportedly said the company have been very helpful since the incident and wouldn't hesitate to use their service again.
