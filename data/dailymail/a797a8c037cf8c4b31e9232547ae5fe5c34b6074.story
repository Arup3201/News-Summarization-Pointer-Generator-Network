Diane Bakuraira, 33, was just 10 years old when she first began to develop feelings for her female classmates.

But when, years later, Diane plucked up the courage to tell her mother about her sexuality, the response was worse than she could ever have imagined.

'I am still struggling to make her 
understand me,' explains the Ugandan human rights activist, 'but it is still very hard. At one point, she called the police to come and arrest me and she has said she wants to disown me.

Fear: Diane Bakuraira says she is living in terror of her life following the enaction of Uganda's anti-gay law

She adds: 'My mother has met most of my gay friends but when she did, she sternly accused them of "spoiling" me.'

Diane is one of an estimated 500,000 gay people in Uganda; a country where homophobia is so entrenched, the government introduced a bill which punishes homosexuals with sentences that range from 14 years for 'first time offenders' to life in prison.

Those who aren't thrown into prison are forced to live with a daily barrage of abuse and risk being 'outed' by local tabloid Red Pepper; a paper notorious for such headlines as: City Tycoons Who Bankroll Ugandan Homos Revealed and Straight By Day, Gay By Night.

In the wake of President Museveni's signing of the anti-gay bill last month, the paper celebrated with the headline: Exposed! Uganda's 200 Top Homos Named; a stunt that led to backers, phone company Orange among them, pulling their ads.

'I got fired from work because the Red Pepper ran a story that claimed I was a famous female DJâ€™s girlfriend,' reveals Diane.

Angry: Diane has been attacked in the Red Pepper newspaper and lost her job because of it

Speaking to MailOnline via email for fear that her phone has been tapped by Government agents, she adds: 'I get so angry and scared for the people being named because the stories put us at risk of mob violence.

'[The Red Pepper] puts them in terrible danger, from their family, landlords
 and bosses. I know four lesbians who have been evicted by their landlords because of Red Pepper and some of my friends have been disowned.'

Shocking though it might sound, being disowned is the last of their worries as Diane explains.

'The police have been to my 
house after someone told them that I am a lesbian and that I was dealing drugs,' she reveals.

'I'm currently looking for a new house because last week, someone slipped an anonymous note under the door that said "tetwagala bisiyaga wano" (we don't want homosexuals here) and I'm scared of what might happen.'

And it's not just at home. On the street, Diane runs a daily gauntlet of ridicule, verbal abuse and even violence at the hands of fellow Ugandans.

'Being a lesbian in Uganda is like being a tourist who walks past a hungry old lion in Tsavo National Park [in Kenya],' she explains.

'It's hard because you're either forced to live a lie all your life or be open about it and then deal with slaps and ridicule at malls and other places. Some of us are even subjected to corrective rape 
by our families.'

But it's the new anti-gay bill and the harsh penalties attached that are currently causing her the most worry.

Shocking: A headline in Ugandan tabloid Rolling Stone which regularly publishes the names of gay citizens

Uganda's Red Pepper tabloid is notorious for its anti-gay stance and inflammatory headlines.

Lowlights include the recent naming of 200 alleged homosexuals following the passage of the anti-gay bill through Uganda's parliament and wild claims that 'homo generals' were responsible for a pair of Al Shabaab bomb blasts in Kampala in 2010.

The paper is owned by General Salim Saleh; the younger brother of President Museveni and a man currently wanted in connection with alleged war crimes by prosecutors at the Hague.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its eye-catching headlines, Red Pepper is one of the country's most popular papers and has been joined by a second tabloid, Rolling Stone, which is just as virulent.

Among recent unpleasant headlines published by the latter are: Men Of Shame Exposed and Hang Them; They Are After Our Kids!!

'I am 
scared, confused and so disappointed in my fellow Ugandans,' she reveals. 
'The way they celebrated like they had won a medal and yet, it's real lives
 at stake.

'I have to admit, I thought a time like this would come but not so soon,' she continues.

Although the bill that finally emerged last month didn't specify, as feared, the death penalty for homosexuals, Diane says the alternative of life in prison is little better.

'I don't think it makes any difference,' she sighs. 'Life imprisonment is more of a death sentence in its own way. Life in a 
Ugandan prison would be like being in hell itself.

'I
 am worried day and night about what might happen but what worries me most is how many innocent lives are at risk, all because they happened to fall in love with the wrong person.'

And she's not the only one terrified about what could happen next. Many of her gay friends, says Diane, have gone into hiding in terror for their lives.

'People are saying 
the law has just stopped them from doing anything,' she reveals. 'Some have stood their 
ground but others, even those who used to take part in rallies, have gone back into hiding.'

For now, Diane says she has no plans to disappear and adds that she hopes things will one day change for the better.

She also hopes that the international community will consider cutting aid to Uganda but says it shouldn't be because of the anti-gay bill but because of the endemic corruption that exists in the country.

'I donâ€™t think aid should be cut because of the new law; 
they should cut it because of the corruption and 
misappropriation of donor funds meant for projects intended to benefit ordinary people, including the LGBT community.

'Human Rights are 
being violated in this country so yes sanctions should be imposed.'

Despite the risks of remaining, Diane says she has no intention of moving abroad and is desperate to stay and fight for her rights.

'I
 hope that, with time, we will be accepted for who we are
 and won't be treated like second class citizens or outcasts.

'But,' she adds, 'I am a Ugandan so leaving has never been an option because this is my country and I belong here.

'I
 would rather stay and fight because if I donâ€™t speak up for myself 
or the community I serve, no one else will.'

Passed into law on 24th February 2014, Uganda's anti-homosexuality act criminalises same sex relations with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment attached.

It also includes a clause that makes it illegal for Ugandans to enter into gay relationships outside the country and calls on other nations to allow extradition of gay citizens to Uganda to face courts there.

Also covered in the bill are media organisations, NGOs, individuals or companies that know of LGBT people and do nothing, or support gay rights.

Originally drafted with the death penalty as the maximum sentence, the bill swiftly became known as the 'Kill the Gays Bill' in the local media.

Since the act came into force, several nations have suspended aid to Uganda, among them Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands.
