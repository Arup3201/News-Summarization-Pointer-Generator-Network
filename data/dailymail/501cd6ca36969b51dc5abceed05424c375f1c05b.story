A gang who posed as police officers to carry out a string of violent robberies have been jailed.

The thugs wore police uniforms and used fake IDs to make their way into people's homes and claimed they were executing official search warrants before beating and tying up their victims so they could flee with their valuables.

They even kidnapped one of their victims and sexually humiliated him with barrel of a shotgun in a bid to get him to phone his friends and ask for more money.

One of the raids happened in front of two young children and a baby.

Richard
Clancy, 27, Connor MacPhee, 
20, Matthew Cheston, 31, Mark
Worthington-Breen, 22, were jailed for a total of 31 years for the string offences, including robbery, burglary and kidnap.

Outlining the prosecution's case at Minshull Crown Court in Manchester, Alex Leech detailed a series of shocking incidents where the men disguised themselves as public officials and forced their way into people's homes.

During one robbery at a house in Salford, the householders 
answered a knock at the door and saw what they believed was a police 
officer who showed ID and claimed to be from the CID.

The bogus officer 
claimed he was searching for weapons, handcuffed the man of the house 
and then radioed for support from sniffer dogs.

Other gang members ransacked the house as the man's wife sobbed before they escaped with cash and jewels.

During
another robbery, a man 
answered a knock at the door and saw what he believed were police 
officers complete with CS spray, stab-proof vests, batons, handcuffs, 
combat trousers and boots.

He
was told a search would be conducted under the Proceeds of Crime Act. 
The gang fled with goods worth thousands of pounds, including a VW Golf.

At another home, the bogus officers claimed they were acting on behalf of Customs and Excise.

The householder was tied up, kidnapped and taken to another address where he was beaten and throttled until he blacked out.

Disguise: During a raid at a house in Birchfield Drive, Salford, a man answered a knock at the door and saw what he believed were police officers complete with CS spray, batons and handcuffs

The gang threatened to stab him in the eyes if he failed to raise more cash.

his head was covered in a pillow case and he was freed although he was 
convinced he would be killed, the court heard. His home was set on fire 
the following day.

The four men also terrorised a family, including two girls aged five and seven and a nine-week-old, by was ransacking their home.

Clancy, of Little Hulton, was sentenced to

burglaries.
