Conviction overturned: Juan Rivera has spent the last 19 years in jail

He had his conviction overturned on Friday after spending the last 19 years in prison, but Juan Rivera could face another appeal by state prosecutors before he is released.

The 39-year-old was jailed in 1992 for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl but a court in Illinois has declared he ‘suffered the nightmare of wrongful incarceration’.

Mr Rivera was told the news by fellow inmates on Saturday but now a pending appeal by state prosecutors could jeopardise his freedom.

Holly Staker was raped and murdered in Waukegan in 1992 and Mr Rivera was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the crime.

A lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime scene and DNA testing in 2005, which proved his semen was not the sperm found in Holly’s body, were critical factors in the appeal.

The court also found that the police’s lengthy interrogation of Mr Rivera, who was originally in custody for burglary, could have influenced his confession.

‘The details the defendant provided were the result of psychological suggestion or linguistic manipulation’, the court ruled.

Mr Rivera is said to have been banging his head against the wall and pulling his hair out during police questioning 19 years ago, The Times reported.

During his trial, jurors were convinced that Mr Rivera knew details of the crime scene that only the murderer would know, but this argument was rejected after the court ruled ‘the evidence supports an inference that details of the crime were provided to the defendant, intentionally or unintentionally during the investigative process.’

Prosecutors are not able to bring Mr Rivera to trial again but they could ask the court to look over the findings again and launch another appeal to block his release.

After learning of the ruling, Mr Rivera told the New York Times by phone: ‘It was overwhelming, it’s still a shocker at this point.

‘This is all I know, 19 years, this type of environment. It’s strange to say, but I’m going to miss all my friends.’

The Lake County state’s attorney, Michael J. Waller, told the newspaper: ‘We are going to study the opinion, confer with our appellate attorneys on Monday and determine a course of action.’
