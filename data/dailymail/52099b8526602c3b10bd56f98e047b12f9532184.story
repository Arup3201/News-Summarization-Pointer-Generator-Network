The chairman of Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, Len Roberts-Smith, said he thought the issue of abuse was bigger than it has been publicly acknowledged

Four former female cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy have revealed fresh allegations of rape and sexual assault by their male superiors.

ABC's Four Corners aired its investigation on Monday night, on which female cadets recounted the horrors the endured while at the academy in the 1990s.

The program also claimed that nothing was done about many of the allegations, with complaints from cadets often locked away in a filing cabinet known as the 'chamber of horrors', never to be seen again.

Some alleged that the perpetrators are currently serving military officers, or are still working for the department.

One former cadet, who went by the fake name 'Susan', said a superior came into her bedroom during the 1990s and proceeded to indecently assault her.

'He was a third year. He was much bigger than me. I just froze and pretended to be dead really, and wished I was,' she said.

Her complaint was one of many that was placed in the filing cabinet known internally as the 'chamber of horrors'. She said the cabinet was full of envelopes - each of them containing a complaint lodged by ADFA cadets alleging sexual harassment or assault.

Susan said she witnessed the process herself, and said that was the last she heard of the incident, believing it was never properly dealt with or investigated.

A still-serving officer, who went by the made-up name 'Jane' and was played by an actress on the program to protect her identity, said she was raped as a cadet during the 1990s.

Even after the assault, Jane decided to stay with the army - but she said she had to watch her attacker move up the ranks, unpunished for his crime.

The report also revealed that many complaints by cadets were unresolved and put away in a filing cabinet dubbed the 'chamber of horrors'

The cabinet was full of envelopes, each of them containing a complaint lodged by cadets at the ADFA alleging sexual harassment or assault.

'To walk around the corner and literally bump into him again was awful. I didn't know how to react. I felt frightened, I felt powerless ... to still have him standing there, laughing and joking with his mates and knowing he's still part of the organisation that I'm in,' she said.

Following a notorious 2011 incident, where two ADFA cadets used Skype to secretly film a female colleague having sex, an external review of sexual and other abuse in the Department of Defence was announced by then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith.

The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce (DART) which has since assessed more than 2,400 complaints of abuse, paid $28 million in compensation and referred 63 matters to police.

But Len Roberts-Smith, the chairman of DART, told the program that he believed the problem of abuse within the military is bigger than it has been publicly acknowledged.
