A second fairground ride called the Vortex left a worker with a broken back, pelvis and leg just days after three people were hospitalized by a separate machine.

Anesto Newell, 32, was in intensive care on Monday after a seating section of the Vortex fell on him on Sunday at the North Carolina State Fair.

The accident happened as fairground workers dismantled equipment at the annual fair in Raleigh. Mr Newell became trapped when part of the seating on the older Vortex ride landed on the lower half of his body.

The injured worker suffered a broken back, pelvis and leg, according to his family members who were working nearby dismantling equipment at the annual state fair

He was taken to WakeMed Hospital in Raleigh where he had surgery and was believed to be in critical condition.

The injured man's brother and sister-in-law who were working nearby told WRAL-TV that he had suffered a broken back, pelvis and leg. They had tried to lift the ride from him but could not.

The Vortex ride which injured Mr Newell had been part of the fairground's main attraction for several years.

The incident follows another Vortex ride which spun into motion last Thursday as people were exiting, dropping riders from heights of up to 30 feet. Five were injured with three still in hospital as a result of their injuries. 

Anthony Gorham, 29, Kisha Gorham, 39, and
a 14-year-old whose name was not released were still in hospital today.
The severity of their injuries is unknown.

On Monday, a ride operator made his 
first court appearance to face criminal charges over injuries at the 
North Carolina State Fair.

Timothy
Dwayne Tutterrow of Quitman, Georgia, faces three counts of assault 
with a deadly weapon, inflicting serious injury when five people were 
injured on a Vortex ride. Three were hospitalized. 

Wake
County District Court Judge Keith Gregory declined to lower Tutterrow's
$225,000 bond. The 46-year-old defendant was returned to jail in 
handcuffs.

Wake Sheriff Donnie Harrison says the ride had been intentionally tampered with to bypass critical safety devices.   

Records show Tutterrow has twice been arrested for drug charges, including a 2002 felony charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

The Vortex ride at the North Carolina State Fair started up without warning and sent people flying through the air on Thursday night

Horrified bystanders watched as riders were thrown off while others tried to hold on to the machine.

Max Byrn, 13, told ABC News Radio that he was watching the ride and had seen people knocked unconscious.

He said:
'There were actually some people that were still, I think, strapped in 
and holding on, really hanging on for their lives.  But they were 
falling like raindrops. It was really crazy.'

The Vortex is a pendulum ride that flips passengers upside down.

Witnesses say the ride had stopped and people 
were getting off when it started moving again.

Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison told ABC11: 'After inspection of the ride, we determined that it had been tampered with and critical safety devices were compromised.'

Tutterrow's lawyer said on Monday that his client was 'devastated' by the incident, adding that the fairground worker is a father and grandfather who would never intentionally hurt anyone and that his prayers were with those who had been injured.
