David Cameron will today announce plans to cut red tape and increase funding to find new treatments for dementia

David Cameron will today call for Britain to lead the fight against dementia, amid fears the number living with the disease in the UK will soar to two million by 2050.

Describing dementia as ‘one of the greatest enemies of humanity’, the Prime Minister will pledge to slash red tape and increase funding to find new treatments to slow the onset of the disease, or even beat it altogether by 2025.

Last night a charity warned that if nothing improves, the number of over-60s living with Alzheimer’s and related conditions will more than double from 800,000 to two million over the next 35 years, putting a huge strain on the NHS and social services. Dementia costs our economy up to £21billion a year in treatment costs and lost productivity.

Mr Cameron will claim that  a ‘big, bold, global push’ is needed to make up for years of underinvestment.

At a health summit in London, he will pledge to  fast-track research, insisting: ‘We have to fight to cure it.’ At least five times more is spent on cancer research than dementia worldwide, and only three new dementia drugs have come on to the market in the last 15 years.

Professor Martin Knapp, from the London School of Economics, said discovering a treatment to delay the onset of dementia by just 36 months would save the country as much as £5billion a year.

Mr Cameron will claim there is a ‘market failure’, with scientists and drug companies having no incentive to prioritise dementia research.

His proposals include measures to ensure patients can get access to dementia drugs more quickly by leapfrogging the usual clinical trials process, along with moves to bring down the cost of medicines.

As well as increasing funding for research, he will call for an extension of patents for dementia drugs to ensure it is worthwhile for pharmaceutical firms to invest, and more collaboration between different countries through a new global fund.

The UK’s Medical Research Council is also planning the world’s biggest study into dementia involving two million people.

Mr Cameron will say: ‘Dementia now stands alongside cancer as one of the greatest enemies of humanity.

‘We have to fight to cure it. I know some people will say that it’s not possible, but we have seen with cancer what medicine can achieve.’

The Prime Minister announced last year that British investment in tackling dementia will be doubled to £122million by 2025.

The Alzheimer’s Society also confirmed a pledge to spend £100million in ten years on research.

An analysis by the charity, published last night, predicts there could be as many as two million people with dementia by 2050, but that the number of sufferers could be dramatically reduced with better drugs.

Dr Dennis Gillings, who was appointed by Mr Cameron as ‘world dementia envoy’ in February, will tell the conference: ‘Dementia is a ticking bomb costing the global economy £350billion and yet progress with research is achingly slow.

‘Just as the world came together in the fight against HIV/AIDS, we need to free up regulation so that we can test ground-breaking new drugs.’
