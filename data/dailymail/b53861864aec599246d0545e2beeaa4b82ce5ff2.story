Gemma Leung was told to cover up if she insisted breastfeeding her eight month old daughter on an easyJet flight to avoid offending other passengers 

A mother was ordered to cover herself up when she tried to breastfeed her daughter on an easyJet flight because  it might 'upset' other passengers.

Mother-of-two Gemma Leung was preparing to feed eight-month-old Ruby-Bow as she flew from Spain to Gatwick to return home to Fareham in Hampshire, when she was told it was best she did not continue.

The 27-year-old was then told if she insisted on breastfeeding she should put a blanket over herself so she didn't offend anyone. 

Mrs Leung, who was flying back to the UK from Spain after a business trip with her mother, said another member of staff later apologised to her. 

But she felt too embarrassed and upset to continue breastfeeding her daughter and was forced to leave her agitated and unhappy during the hourney. 

I couldn't believe what I was hearing,' said Mrs Leung. 

'It ruined the whole trip for me and my mum. It's just not right.'

Mrs Leung and her mother, Sasha Mueller, were on a flight from Valencia to Gatwick on Wednesday morning when she was asked by a male member of cabin crew to cover up if she fed her daughter. 

Mrs Leung said: 'We were just about to take off so I thought to calm her down I would feed her.

'Then he approached me and said he would rather I didn't do that on the flight as it might offend other passengers.

'I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Then he said that if I did breastfeed could I put a blanket over my baby.

'The air hostess came over afterwards and asked if I was okay. When I told her what happened her face dropped and she went and confronted him.'

Mrs Leung said the male employee returned to speak to her again, but instead of apologising made the situation worse. 

Mrs Leung tried to feed her eight-month-old daughter Ruby-Bow when she became distressed on a flight 

'He came back and said 'it's a bit of a tricky situation and we need to consider other passengers and how they feel',' said Mrs Leung.

'No-one had complained about me feeding and there were quite a few babies on board. I was wearing a shirt, you couldn't see anything.

'It was so embarrassing for me. I didn't carry on breastfeeding after that so she was an unhappy baby for the flight and I got a few people looking at me because of that.'

Mrs Leung's mother said  she was angered by the comments.  

'I was so shocked because we have used easyJet for years and never had a problem,' she said. 

'I couldn't speak I was so angry. I was just shell-shocked that this had happened in the 21st century.'

Mrs Leung, who is currently on maternity leave, submitted a complaint to easyJet when she returned from holiday and was told she would have to wait 28 days for a response.

An easyJet spokesman said the incident was being investigated.

The spokesman said: 'easyJet is a family friendly airline and our policy is that that passengers can breastfeed at any time during the flight including during take-off and landing and we do not require mothers to cover themselves.

'We are sorry that Mrs Leung was advised to cover up when breastfeeding onboard by one of our crew members on her flight from Valencia to London Gatwick on March 4.

'The crew member was immediately corrected by another member of crew who apologised to Mrs Leung.

'This does not reflect easyJet's policy on breastfeeding. We try to ensure we always consider the needs of families travelling onboard easyJet.

'We are now investigating with the staff involved and ensure that cabin crew are clear on our policy in relation to breastfeeding.'

In February Ellie Hiscox went to Dough Pizza Kitchen, in Manchester's Northern Quarter, to celebrate her birthday. She deliberately booked a table there because she had had no problem breastfeeding there before, only to be told she must cover up if she wanted to continue feeding her three-month-old daughter. 

Last year Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told she would not be allowed to breastfeed her daughter at Middleton Pool because of the site's food and drink regulations. 

In January new mothers invited to a summit on breast feeding at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium were told it was not appropriate to bring their children because the venue was 'not designed to accommodate breastfeeding.' 

Louise Burns was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head while she breastfed in Claridge's in London in December last year. The incident led to a protest outside the exclusive hotel, with 40 mothers holding a mass nursing protest. 

In 2014 Rhea Holley was branded a 'slut' by a couple in their 60s when she tried to breastfeed her baby at a Costa coffee in Purley in London. 

Heather Vaughan, 29, said she was left in tears after a male staff member at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth ordered her to stop breastfeeding in its creche, saying: ‘We don’t do that here' last March. 

The same month, Emily Slough was branded a ‘tramp’ by internet trolls after somebody took a photograph of her breastfeeding in public in Rugeley, Staffordshire.

Elsewhere, nurses stopped Gemma Murphy, 37, from feeding her infant daughter in a waiting room at St Cross Hospital in Rugby.
