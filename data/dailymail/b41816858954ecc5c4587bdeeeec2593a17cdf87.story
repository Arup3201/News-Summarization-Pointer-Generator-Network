NFL legend Jim Kelly is free of cancer after three months of chemotherapy, according to the hospital overseeing his treatment.

Hall of Fame quarterback Kelly was evaluated on Tuesday at the New York Head & Neck Institute at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and given the good news.

Dr Peter Costantino, the hospital’s Executive Director, said: ‘The great news is that upon physical examination, there is no evidence of the cancer.

‘The treatments so far have completely eliminated Mr. Kelly's pain and his level of function has essentially returned to normal.’

Kelly will now undergo a series of tests to determine if any further treatment will be necessary.

Should treatment be required, it would likely consist of surgery followed by a form of highly focused radiation referred to as Gamma Knife Therapy, the hospital said in a statement.

‘It is possible that no further treatment will be required, and the testing over the next week will define this issue,’ Dr. Costantino said.

Determined: A few months ago the former football player posted a video promising that he 'will be back'

Earlier this year Mr Kelly’s daughter, Erin, posted a touching photograph of her father embracing his wife on Mother’s Day.

It carried the caption: 'Daddy just wanted to dance with his bride on Mother's Day.'

The former Buffalo Bills quarterback closed his eyes as he appreciated the moment.

The Hall of Famer's family has regularly shared snaps of his battle, including their celebrations when he returned home from hospital in April.

Kelly, 54, had undergone surgery in Buffalo last June to remove cancerous cells from his upper jaw and he was declared cancer-free.

But earlier this year, he announced the disease had returned.
