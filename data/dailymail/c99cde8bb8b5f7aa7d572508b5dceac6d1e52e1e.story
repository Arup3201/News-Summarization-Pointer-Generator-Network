AC Milan are continuing talks with Chelsea over a potential deal for Fernando Torres, with the Serie A giants light in attack following Mario Balotelli's £16million move to Liverpool.

Milan want to take the former Atletico Madrid forward on loan but the player's camp are awaiting proposals for a permanent transfer.

Roma are also said to be considering a move for Torres, who was left out of Chelsea's match-day squad for their Premier League win against Leicester.

Benched: Torres (centre) was an unused substitute in Chelsea's 3-1 win at Burnley on Monday

The Spanish striker was an unused substitute in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Burnley on Monday night and has been linked with a Stamford Bridge exit this summer.

Torres has struggled for form since moving to Stamford Bridge from Liverpool in a £50million deal back in January 2011.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has bolstered his side's attacking options this summer with the signing of Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa for £32million, while Blues legend Didier Drogba also returned to the club. 

Despite Torres being out of favour in London, Mourinho insisted he is 'going nowhere' in a recent press conference.

The former Liverpool forward, who receives £150,000-a-week in wages at Stamford Bridge, wants Chelsea to pay up the two years remaining on his deal - totalling around £16m - if he is to leave the club.
