A former bank worker is facing jail for helping steal £123,000 from a customer - despite her claims she was forced into the plot by conmen who threatened to publish naked pictures of her online.

Anisyah Ali, who worked at Halifax's North Finchley branch, passed confidential details to her then-fiance Salim Hussain and others, who looted customer Julian Masters' bank account.

She claimed she only agreed to aid with the scam after fraudsters threatened to publish compromising photos of her on the internet.

Both Ali, 25,  and Salim, 29,  are tonight facing prison sentences after they were convicted of fraud.

Former bank adviser Anisyah Ali was found guilty of fraud for aiding a plot to spirit £123,000 out of a customer's account. She insisted she was forced to help fraudsters, who threatened to publish photos of her

The Old Bailey heard Ali abused her position as a personal banker to order a new debit card and PIN number for an account, which was then used by criminals.

The new card was used to buy  cars and gold jewellery and withdraw cash, the court was told.

The card was blocked in 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account.

But information gleaned from the account allowed the fraudsters to phone the bank to remove a block, prosecutors said.

By the time the customer spotted the fraud, purchases totaling £123,000 had already been approved. The bank declined another £114,000.

Receipts for cash payments totalling more than £1,500 were later found in Ali's bag while receipts for gold jewellery were found in her Southall home, which she then shared with Hussain.

Ali's now ex-husband, Salim Hussain, was also found guilty of fraud by false representation for his role in the scam

Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900.

Prosecutor, David Hughes said: '[Ali] was a pivotal figure. The fraud could not have been carried out without the involvement of Ms Ali.

'She used and abused her position to access the account, obtain the necessary information to change the account owner's address to another one connected to the fraudsters and enabled the obtaining of the debit card used to carry out fraudulent transactions in a variety of locations on many occasions.'

Ali said she was forced to take part in the fraud by conmen who threatened to publish photos of her online.

She wept as she told how her friends and family had deserted her after the naked 'sexts', which she had sent to a previous lover and had already ended up on a Danish porn website and fake Facebook profile.

She said: 'It is a very, very difficult subject. When he told me it was going to happen for a second time it made me even more scared because it would have involved Salim’s family and we would not be able to get married. 

'They would have thought very bad of me. For me to know he could have been taken away from me at any point because of that, it frightened me, it scared me, and to know that he could have been hurt at the same time.'

Salim claimed he and his now ex-wife Ali were subjected to a campaign of harassment by Alexander Saeed, who earlier admitted fraud.

He said he did not benefit from the scam and only did as he was told because he was scared of Saeed.

'I was never, ever in possession of the card. I didn't have any of the card details,' he told the jury; 'I didn't know what transactions were taking place at any time.'

Ali, of Norwood, south London, was convicted of one count of fraud by false representation and one count of fraud by abuse of position.

Salim, of Southall, west London, was found guilty of a single count of fraud by false representation.

The Old Bailey heard the couple could now face jail when they are sentenced later this year

Judge Michael Shorrock QC warned both they face immediate jail terms when they are sentenced alongside Alexander Saeed in April.

Detective Constable Aine Matthews, the officer leading the investigation, said after the convictions: 'Rather than safeguarding the interests of her customers, Ali did the exact opposite and betrayed the position of trust she held within the bank.

'Today's convictions send out a clear message to those facing the same temptation – commit these crimes and you will be brought to justice.' 

Another man, Zain Hussain, of Hounslow, west London, was found not guilty of fraud.
