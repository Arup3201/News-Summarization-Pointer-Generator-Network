Tigermum: Angela Garcia ordered her son to get out of the car and walk home

A Texas mother has been arrested after she threw her child out of the car on a busy freeway and ordered him to walk home.

Angela Garcia, 34, was arguing with her 10-year-old son and decided to punish him by having him make his own way down a freeway southeast of Houston.

The boy walked in the dark for about 15 minutes before authorities stopped him, League City police said.

Local police received a report of a child walking on the freeway shoulder at around 8.30PM.

The police vehicle that picked him up eventually encountered Ms Garcia, parked on the shoulder of the Interstate 45, known as Gulf Freeway.

She had been driving 300ft in front of the boy, but he had not been able to see the car as it was dark outside.

League City Police has charged Ms Garcia with Abandoning or Endangering a Child after the incident.

‘Making your child walk home on I-45 at 8.30 at night in the dark, in a busy stretch where many fatalities have occurred that is crossing the line,’ League City Police Officer Reagan Pena told MyFoxHouston.com. 

‘It's on a major roadway. There are many cars going, it's also a stretch of freeway we've had many fatalities in the last month. The child truly was in danger.’

‘The way things are, he could have been kidnapped, killed,’ a League City resident told told KHOU-TV.com.

‘That’s not right. You don’t treat children like that. Either take care of your kids or you don’t have any.’

One of Ms Garcia’s neighbours told the website it was a surprise to hear of the incident, and said it was out of character for the mother-of-two.

‘I can’t believe it. They are a nice family,’ the neighbor said. ‘The boys are so nice.’

Garcia, a resident of League City, held Tuesday at the Galveston County jail on a $7,500 bond.

The boy and his brother, who was also travelling in the car, have been released into the custody of their father.
