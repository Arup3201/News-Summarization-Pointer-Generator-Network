According to the BBC, cuts of 4.7inches and 3.9inches were made to the 25-year-old bullfighter's thigh and gluteal muscles during the battle.

Federico Dominguez, de los Angeles' assistant, was also gored by the massive bull, BBC reported.

Gamusino injured two different assistants as well as a farmer after he leaped over the ring and went into a walkway, according to AFP. One of the assistants reportedly had a concussion and is in serious condition.

5,000 people went to the bullring on Sunday, as part of a ten-day event, the wire service reported.  

After being attended to by medics Ms de los Angeles continued the fight only to be gored a second time

Speaking to Picture Radio in Spanish, de los Angeles said 'I'm sad because I could not cut off an ear and I could not kill a second bull.'

De los Angeles also stated that she and three people that Gamusido wounded are in the hospital. 

'It was [a very bloody run], there were many mishaps, thank God, so far as it goes, we're fine,' she told Picture Radio. 'You have to accept it as it is, to recover and what comes.' 

de los Angeles' Facebook shows that in addition to being a female bullfighter, she is also the mother of a young girl.  

AFP reported that it was the first time three female Mexican bullfighters participated in the event at the Plaza de Toros de Mexico.

During General Francisco Franco's reign, women in Spain were not allowed to be matadors, BBC reported. That has since changed, though not many  bullfight professionally.
