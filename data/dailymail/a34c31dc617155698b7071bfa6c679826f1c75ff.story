Vitamin D deficiency: Scientists have finally discovered what killed the composer Mozart aged just 35

If only Mozart had spent a little more time outdoors enjoying the sunshine – because then we might have had a few more masterpieces.

Scientists discovered the composer, who died at just 35, did not get enough sunlight. 

He lived in Austria, which was darker than most of Europe, and would work through the night and sleep during the day. 

This prevented his body from producing sufficient levels of vitamin D.

Mozart suffered illness throughout his life, including kidney disease, smallpox, typhoid fever, tonsillitis and strep throat.

Retired Nasa scientist Dr William Grant, believes that vitamin D deficiency was the underlying cause of his  poor health and early death.

Dr Grant said: ‘Almost every disease has a vitamin D connection. If only Mozart had known about vitamin D and had access to supplements, he could have doubled his lifetime’s output of work.’

The ‘sunshine vitamin’ is essential for bone health and is produced when the skin is exposed to the ultraviolet B sunrays.

Vitamin D deficiency is linked to many medical conditions, and increases the risk of developing influenza, pneumonia, certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal pain.

Another victim: Austrian composer Gustav Mahler died in 1911 from bacterial endocarditis, which is also caused by a lack of vitamin D

'The same goes for several other famous musicians who died at young ages.

'I think modern-day musicians are unaware of the fact that by staying indoors, they are not getting the adequate amount of vitamin D that they need.'

The study 'Medical Problems of Performing Artists' also suggests two other famous musicians died from lack of sunlight.

British cellist Jacqueline Mary du Pre died in 1987 aged 42 from multiple sclerosis, a disease linked to vitamin D deficiency.

Austrian composer Gustav Mahler died in 1911 from bacterial endocarditis, which is also caused by a lack of vitamin D.

Many have speculated over Mozart’s 
death. He was buried just three days after he died in 1791, and no 
autopsy was ever performed.
