If you thought it was cold where you are at the moment then a visit to the Russian village of Oymyakon might just change your mind.

With the average temperature for January standing at -50C, it is no wonder the village is the coldest permanently inhabited settlement in the world.

Known as the 'Pole of Cold', the coldest ever temperature recorded in Oymyakon was -71.2C.

Oymyakon, which is considered to be the coldest permanently inhabited 
settlement in the world

The thick fur of these East Siberian Laikas puppies keeps them warm: Oymyakon is 750 metres above sea level, which means that the length 
of a day varies from 3 hours in December to 21 hours in the summer

The village, which is home to around 500 people, was originally a stop-over for reindeer herders who would water their flocks from the thermal spring

Daily problems that come with living in Oymyakon include pen
 ink freezing, glasses freezing to people's faces and batteries losing 
power.

Locals are said to leave their cars running all day for fear of 
not being able to restart them.

Another
 problem caused by the frozen temperatures is burying dead bodies, which
 can take up to three days. The earth must first have thawed 
sufficiently in order to dig, so a bonfire is lit for a couple
 of hours. Hot coals are 
then pushed to the side and a hole a couple of inches deep is dug. The 
process is repeated for several days until the hole is deep enough to 
bury the coffin.

This is the lowest recorded temperature for any permanently inhabited 
location on Earth and the lowest temperature recorded in the Northern 
Hemisphere

The village, which is home to around 500 
people, was, in the 1920s and 1930s, a stopover for reindeer herders who would water 
their flocks from the thermal spring.

But the Soviet government, in its 
efforts to settle nomadic populations, believing them to be difficult to
 control and technologically and culturally backward, made the site a 
permanent settlement.

Ironically, Oymyakon actually means 'non-freezing water' due to a nearby hot spring.

Most homes in Oymyakon still burn coal and wood for heat and enjoy few modern conveniences.

Nothing grows there so people eat reindeer meat and horsemeat. A single shop 
provides the town's bare necessities and the locals work as 
reindeer-breeders, hunters and ice-fisherman.

Doctors say the reason the locals don't suffer from malnutrition is that their animals' milk contains a lot of micronutrients.

Unsurprisingly, locals are hardened to the weather and unlike in other 
countries - where a flurry of snow brings things grinding to a halt, 
Oymyakon's solitary school only shuts if temperatures fall below -52C.

The village is located around 750 metres above sea level and the length of a day varies from 3 hours in December to 21 hours in 
the summer.

And despite its terrible winters, in June, July and August temperatures over 30c are not uncommon.

There are few modern conveniences in the village - with many buildings 
still having outdoor toilets - and most people still burn coal and wood 
for heat. When coal deliveries are irregular the power 
station starts burning wood. If the power ceases, the town shuts down in
 about five hours, and the pipes freeze and crack.

Oymyakon lies a two day drive from the city of Yakutsk, the regional 
capital, which has the coldest winter temperatures for any city in the 
world.

It is served by two airports and is home
 to a university, schools, theatres and museums.

Daily problems that come with living in Oymyakon include pen ink freezing, glasses freezing to people's faces and batteries losing power. Locals are said to leave their cars running all day for fear of not being able to restart them.

Even if there was coverage for mobile phone reception the phones themselves would not work in such cold conditions.
