Bacary Sagna is continuing to unwind ahead of the new season after hitting Miami Beach with his wife Ludivine.

The Manchester City new boy has been afforded an extended holiday having made it to the quarter-finals of the World Cup with France.

And the 31-year-old is enjoying a Stateside break ahead of meeting his new team-mates.

Life's a beach: Manchester City's Bacary Sagna and his wife Ludivine Kardi Sagna relax on Miami Beach

Sagna and his wife soaked up the sun and went jet-skiing at the popular Florida resort.

The
 former Arsenal defender agreed to join City on a £150,000-a-week deal 
after eight years with the Gunners, but denies he left for financial 
reasons.

'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money.

'For
 people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I 
needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time.

'It
 was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and 
it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a
 lot of respect for Arsenal.’

Tearful exit: Sagna's last game for Arsenal was in their 3-2 FA Cup final victory against Hull City in May

High note: The FA Cup victory was the only trophy Sagna won during his seven-year spell at Arsenal
