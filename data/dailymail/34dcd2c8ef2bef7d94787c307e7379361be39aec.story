Arjen Robben won't be tuning in to the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Atletico Madrid as he 'couldn't watch' the first leg.

Robben was part of the Bayern Munich side humiliated 4-0 by Real Madrid at home to crash out of the competition on Tuesday night.

However, the Holland winger doesn't care who faces Real in the final, despite playing for Chelsea between 2004 and 2007.

Robben slammed the quality of football on display in last week's first leg in Madrid, which ended in a 0-0 draw.

Quizzed on Wednesday night's crucial tie, Robben said: 'I don't really care. I watched the 90 minutes last week and I couldn't watch it. The match had nothing to do with football.

'I respect the two managers [Jose Mourinho and Diego Simeone] and everybody has their own way, but I think Real Madrid will win the Champions League and I wish them all the best.'

Robben moved from Stamford Bridge to Real in 2007 and revealed his disappointment at not getting one over his old side.

He said: 'It's a massive disappointment. We were very hopeful, the atmosphere was great and we tried everything we knew.

'We
 attacked from the off, but when you concede two goals from set plays 
you know it's all over, and then we let in another one. We knew we were 
playing the world's best counter-attacking team.'
