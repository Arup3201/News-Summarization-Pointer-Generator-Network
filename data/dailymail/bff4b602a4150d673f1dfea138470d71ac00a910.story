A double killer who knifed his girlfriend and their six-year-old son to death in a frenzied attack will today begin a court bid to inherit their £200,000 estate.

Paranoid schizophrenic Paul Chadwick is seeking to exploit a loophole in the law that prevents killers profiting from their crimes.

But his victims’ family have told of their torment at the prospect of having to face him across a courtroom again and their anguish at having to relive the tragedy.

Chadwick, 35, claims that his mental illness meant that he had not intended to kill. 

He has been granted permission to bring a test case at the High Court – and has applied for the case to be heard in secret ‘in the interests of justice’, claiming it would breach his human rights for confidential information about him and his financial affairs to be made public.

Chadwick stabbed partner Lisa Clay 32 times and their son Joseph 25 times at their home in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, in April last year. 

His plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted and last September he was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a secure mental unit.

The landscape gardener has been granted permission to leave the secure unit in Preston to give evidence at the hearing at Manchester Civil Justice Centre. 

Chadwick is demanding the £150,000 semi-detached home he shared with Miss Clay, 40, his son’s £30,000 trust fund and £16,000 in joint bank accounts.

He claims that because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried out the killings he is entitled to the assets – the proceeds of money inherited by Miss Clay – because he was the beneficiary of her will.

If successful, he could set a precedent for other killers to make a claim because their mental health was impaired at the time of their crimes.

The Forfeiture Act of 1982 says those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes.

But there is clause allowing that ban to be waived in exceptional circumstances. For example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her partner, she may still be able to inherit his estate.

Preston Crown Court heard that Chadwick had complained of hearing voices days before the killings and told Miss Clay, who worked part-time in a Marks & Spencer store, he was concerned that people thought he was gay.

Miss Clay’s family, who learnt of the High Court action just before Christmas, told in a statement yesterday of their anguish at Chadwick’s attempt to claim his victims’ estate.

‘To have Lisa and Joseph killed in this way is a tragedy we will never overcome,’ it said. ‘But to be faced with the prospect of seeing their killer in court, fighting to inherit money from the two people he stabbed to death, has been too much for us.

‘He has nothing to lose from taking this action, but it has caused such torment for us.

‘One of Lisa’s aunts was going to give evidence but has had to pull out because of the anguish caused by the thought of seeing him.

‘She is still distraught and this has brought back the nightmares.’

Another family member due to give evidence, who does not want to be named, said: ‘I’m dreading the idea of going into the witness box and seeing him. Is it justice that he can stand there in court with the hope of claiming Lisa’s estate while we have to sit there with the prospect that he could soon be released to enjoy the spoils of his horrendous crime?’

Miss Clay’s relatives have been forced to use their savings to fight the case, while Chadwick has launched a claim against them for his legal costs to be paid.

Keith Etherington, of Slater & Gordon, who is representing Miss Clay’s family, said: ‘Manslaughter is the unjustifiable, inexcusable and intentional killing of another person. The usual rule should not be relaxed where the violence was grievous and unprovoked, as here.’
