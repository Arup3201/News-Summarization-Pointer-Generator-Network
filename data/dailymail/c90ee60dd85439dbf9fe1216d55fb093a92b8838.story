It's the picture that has broken the internet over the last 24 hours... is the dress white and gold, or blue and black?

Celebrities far and wide have had their say, and now it's the turn of the professional footballer. 

Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has weighed into the debate, in an Instagram video posted by the club's official account.

This dress has sparked debate, with viewers disagreeing over the colour: blue and black, or white and gold?

'It's blue and black?!,' the Manchester City midfielder exclaims, before the presenter retorts: 'It's white and gold.' 

Outraged, and perhaps echoing the thoughts of half the world, Toure says 'White and gold? How is it possible?', storming off.

He turns again to shout his thoughts, but it's certainly a debate that has divided not just the nation, but further ashore too.

Elsewhere at City, as shown in a video for the club's official YouTube channel CityTV, a number of the squad are divided, with Gael Clichy claiming that it's 'the big talk in the dressing room.'

The former Arsenal defender is firmly in the black and blue camp, but revealed that David Silva and Samir Nasri had seen one combination, before changing their minds an hour later.

Nasri, upon leaving the training ground on Friday, was asked his thoughts by the presenters, claiming 'now I see white and gold', while Pablo Zabaleta told the presenter to 'put some glasses on' when she disagreed with his view. 

Members of the Crystal Palace squad have also become embroiled in the debate, with midfielder James McArthur writing on Twitter: 'This colour of the dress picture is doing my head in. How can people see white and gold?', while striker Dwight Gayle claimed: 'This dress is starting to create a massive divide in the team. I'm adamant it's blue and black.'

At Newcastle, the squad aren't sure. Rolando Arrons said: 'It's white and gold!! I'm tired of seeing this stupid dress', but Sammy Ameobi disagreed, claiming: 'This dress is black & blue right? Not white and gold!' 

Not one to involve himself in speculation, Carlton Cole is firm in his response: 'It don't matter if that dress is white/gold or black/blue its horrific anyway. Lol.' 

Elsewhere, pop sensations Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift have claimed it is blue and black, while the Sportsmail office is split 50/50.

But what do you think...?
