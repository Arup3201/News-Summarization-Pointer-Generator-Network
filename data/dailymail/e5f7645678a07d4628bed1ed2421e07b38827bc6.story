The Everyday Sexism Project has hit 50,000 entries in just over a year and a half.

Laura Bates, 26, from London, founded the anti-sexist initiative in April 2012. It aims to raise awareness of discrimination based on gender.

The site made headlines worldwide in May when its hugely successful campaign led to Facebook changing its policy on content endorsing rape and violence against women.

The #FBRape initiative highlighted the flaw in the social network’s guidelines which banned hate speech but not offensive remarks regarding sexual assault.

The campaign saw several companies pull their advertisements from Facebook, and the website agreed to change its policies.

At the time, the Mail reported that the Project had collected over 30,000 women's experiences of gender imbalance in just over a year.

'I see and hear stories every single day
 from women whose lives are directly impacted by sexism, misogyny and 
sexual abuse,' said Laura.

Laura sees the 50,000 records of everyday sexism as a sign there is a lot more to be done.

She said: 'It is a testament to the 
sheer scale of the problem that we have reached 50,000 entries in such a
 short space of time.

'Every woman has a story. Sexism and harassment 
have become normalised and accepted, from schoolgirls facing regular 
harassment in their uniform to women in the workplace being marginalised
 and discriminated against, to female politicians facing open sexism in 
the House of Commons.

'Against the backdrop of the media’s constant 
portrayal of women as disposable sex objects, we are facing an epidemic 
of sexual violence, with over two women per week killed by a current or 
former partners, 400,000 women sexually assaulted and over 85,000 raped 
every year.

'If the Project has shown anything, it is that gender 
inequality is a spectrum, and these things are all connected.

'The same 
ideas and attitudes that underlie ‘minor’ incidents like catcalls, which
 we are so often told to ignore, or brush off, are also at the root of 
more serious incidents of violence and assault.

'We have to tackle the 
normalised acceptance of sexism in the public sphere.'

The Project has expanded into 17 different 
countries worldwide.

Entries have flooded in from women around the 
world, as well as men, and have covered the full range of experiences of
 gender inequality. From sexual harassment in public spaces to workplace
 discrimination, sexual assault and rape, shocking stories have been heard from around the globe.

Some 15 new branches are in 
the pipeline, in countries including Japan, Mexico, Serbia and India.

The
 Project has been vocally supported by many male celebrities, including 
Simon Pegg and James Corden.

It has quickly amassed a dedicated social 
media following, with 111,000 Twitter followers, and has led several 
successful high-profile campaigns, including the #FBrape campaign of 
this Summer.

In the 
past few months, the Everyday Sexism Project joined forces with the 
British Transport Police on Project Guardian, an initiative that saw 
2000 police officers given special training to crack down on sexual 
offences on public transport.

Alongside an online awareness campaign led
 by Everyday Sexism, Project Guardian has seen an increase of 20 per 
cent in reporting of sexual offences on public transport and a 32 per 
cent rise in detection of offenders. 

The Everyday Sexism Project
 has been used by MPs, businesses, schools and universities, and took 
part in the drafting of new guidelines on media equality at the Council 
of Europe.

Next year it will launch a major international campaign on 
sexual violence in teen relationships. A book about the project will be 
published by Simon & Schuster next year.

Laura Bates, the 
founder of the project, last week won a Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women of 
the Year Award for her work on gender equality.
