Laws safeguarding journalists’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘snooping’ by the police, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

He said he was ‘concerned’ by recent cases in which detectives used powers to spy on reporters and obtain details of their sources ‘without clear justification’.

The Deputy Prime Minister called for journalists to be given a wider public interest defence if charged with breaking the law in pursuit of a story, saying it was ‘incredibly important in a free society’.

Protection: Laws protecting journalists’ sources must be strengthened to prevent ‘snooping’, Nick Clegg said

Revelations that police used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access details of reporters’ phone conversations sparked calls for reform. 

Speaking at a press conference in London yesterday, Mr Clegg said the law should be changed to require the use of Ripa powers to reveal journalists’ sources to be signed off by a judge.

Asked about recent cases, Mr Clegg replied: ‘I am concerned about this. It is incredibly important in a free society that journalists should be able to go after information where there’s a clear public interest to do so without fear that they will be snooped upon or have their files rifled through without clear justification.’

He went on: ‘Where the police ask you (a journalist) for information which might reveal your sources – privileged information – that shouldn’t be done on the say so of a police officer, even a senior police officer. That should only be done on the say so of a judge.

'It is a big thing to say to the Press in this country: “We can demand to know where you got your information from and we don’ t even need to go to a judge to do so.” That needs to change.’

Mr Clegg also signalled unease over the large number of current prosecutions against journalists. Existing laws provide reporters with only a limited defence that the story they were pursuing was in the public interest.

Mr Clegg said this defence should now be enshrined in law, with amendments made to a number of major pieces of legislation to make it clear that there are circumstances where journalists can legitimately break the law in pursuit of a story.

‘There should be a public interest defence put in law - you would probably need to put it in the Data Protection Act, the Bribery Act, maybe one or two other laws as well - where you enshrine a public interest defence for the press so that where you are going after information and you are being challenged, you can set out a public interest defence to do so,’ he said.

Mr Clegg also called yesterday for jail terms for anyone found guilty of large-scale data theft.

‘The penalties that exist at the moment are pathetic - a small rap over the knuckles and a £100 fine. There should be a custodial sentence attached to major data theft.’

Recent concern has focused on four cases in which it emerged that police forces used Ripa to spy on journalists. In three cases, the powers were used to seize phone records, despite the journalists involved not being suspected of breaking the law.

In one case involving the Mail on Sunday, the phone records of two journalists were seized as part of an inquiry into allegations that Constance Briscoe, a former judge, had misled the police.

Home Secretary Theresa May has promised to publish a revised code ‘to make clear that specific consideration must be given to communications data requests involving those in sensitive professions, such as journalists’.

But Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, has defended the practice, saying ‘nobody should be above the law’.

Speaking mast week, Mr Rowley said: ‘We will keep using the powers to chase down criminals whether they are ordinary members of the public or journalists.’
