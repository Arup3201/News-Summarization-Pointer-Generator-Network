More than six New Jersey firefighters have been disciplined after posting a video on Facebook which shows two trucks blasting and knocking down a colleague with three high-powered water hoses in a so-called 'cold water challenge.'

Under the challenge, which is doing the rounds online, participants nominate each other to jump in cold water and film it - if they do, they pay $10 towards a designated charity, if they don't they donate $100.

The stunt, by Whitman Square Fire Company volunteer firefighters, was posted on YouTube on May 20 and quickly caught the attention of fire district officials who condemned the actions and started tracking down the firefighters involved.

The man is quickly drenched by the water and a blast to the head knocks him down. Someone can be heard laughing in the background.

'Recently, a video surfaced on social media involving several firefighters at one of our stations utilizing department equipment to "deluge" water on a firefighter in an open field,' Fire District Chief John Hoffman said in a statement, according to nj.com.

'This action was NOT sanctioned by the department, the use of the equipment was not approved and the individual firefighters involved behaved inappropriately and outside of the boundaries of department policy, procedures and standing orders.'

Hoffman said no firefighters were injured in the incident.

But Board of Fire Commissioners Chairman Sam Micklus told nj.com that the incident could easily have left someone dead.

'The hose they used could've killed someone,' he said. 'I'm still shaking my head. They should've known better.'

Micklus lambasted the use of public equipment and water for the challenge.

'That's taxpayer money and equipment out the window,' he said.

All the firefighters involved were volunteers and not paid members of the department, however.

Discipline will range from a verbal reprimand to suspension.

Hoffman insisted that most cold water challenge videos are harmless and bring attention and funds to important charities.

'This one just got out of control,' Hoffman said. 'And we're dealing with it.'
