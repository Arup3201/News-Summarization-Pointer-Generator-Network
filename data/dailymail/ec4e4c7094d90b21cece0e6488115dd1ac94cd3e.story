XCOM: Enemy Unknown was one of the best turn-based-strategy games of recent times. It’s no surprise, then, that its universe is expanding.

Although this XCOM spin-off has been in development since 2006, numerous facelifts have transformed what was once a first-person shooter into a third-person adventure.

But thankfully, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified promises to retain the tactical element fans have come to expect from the series.

Changed for the better: Although reaction was mixed when 2K Marin first unveiled the game, transforming it into a third-person shooter seems like a sensible move

Developed by 2K Marin, the team behind Bioshock 2, Declassified is set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War.

Originally established as America’s covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before.

As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic.

Similar to the previous game, your decisions have a serious impact on the overall result. Every command can mean the difference between life and death for Carter, his squad and mankind.

Carter can also use a unique Battle Focus ability – although exact details about how this works have not been revealed.

It has also been reported that Declassifed is a single player experience, and will not feature any sort of multiplayer.

‘We’re thrilled about 2K Marin’s refined vision for The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,' said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K.

'The game has evolved through a creative and iterative development process, and the result is a narrative-driven experience that is smart, engaging, and challenges players to think tactically.'

Watch this space: There is still no word yet on whether Declassified will be coming to next-gen consoles

He added: ‘The team has been working hard to leverage core XCOM elements like tactical decision-making and permanent death of squad mates in a purposeful way that makes this a unique tactical shooter.

‘To that end, The Bureau will challenge players unlike any other third-person tactical shooter.’

It's set for release on August 20 in North America and August 23 internationally.
