Princes William and Harry were among more than 150 public figures kept under surveillance by a private detective working for the News of the World, it emerged last night.

The princes were secretly followed and filmed under the noses of their armed protection officers on the instructions of the now defunct Sunday newspaper.

Scores of high-profile celebrities, politicians and sportsmen were spied on over an eight-year period by Derek Webb, a former policeman who claims to have received MI5 training during his career with the Hertfordshire Constabulary.

Harry’s former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, actress Angelina Jolie and football pundit Gary Lineker were also targeted, as was Maxine Carr, former partner of Soham killer Ian Huntley.

Mr Webb, who is believed to have earned hundreds of thousands of pounds working for the News of the World, was still following people on its behalf until its closure in the summer.

Labour MP Tom Watson, who has been a thorn in the side of News International by continually raising phone hacking in the Commons, was watched when he attended a conference in Brighton last year.

Solicitor Mark Lewis and his former assistant Charlotte Harris, who represent many of the most prominent phone-hacking victims, were also trailed.

Mr Webb revealed the industrial scale of the spying operation when he told BBC’s Newsnight that he was paid to follow targets selected by the newspaper from 2003 until it was shut down in July.

He said other targets were Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Several former Cabinet members, including John Prescott and Charles Clarke, were also followed.

Although carrying out surveillance is not illegal, the revelations mean the News of the World continued to snoop on people even after its royal editor Clive Goodman was jailed for phone hacking in 2007.

Goodman admitted working with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to intercept messages, including those left on the phones of senior royal aides.

News International’s chairman, James Murdoch, will inevitably face difficult questions about the surveillance when he appears before MPs tomorrow.

Members of the Culture, Media and 
Sport Committee, which is probing the phone-hacking scandal, want to 
know who sanctioned the surveillance operations.

A lawyer working for the News of the 
World instructed a private detective to put two solicitors under 
surveillance in a bid to get them into professional difficulties.

Julian Pike, a partner at the Queen’s 
solicitors, Farrer and Co, told News International executives that 
trailing rival lawyers Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris could reveal they
were ‘an item’.

In a separate email to private 
detective Derek Webb, he added that if they could be shown to be living 
together, it could help bring professional misconduct proceedings 
against them. In another letter to Mr Webb, Mr Pike wrote: ‘I write to 
confirm my instruction.’

Mr Lewis and Miss Harris are the 
outspoken representatives of some of the most high-profile victims of 
phone hacking by the News of the World, including  the family of Milly 
Dowler.

The suspicions proved to be without 
foundation but Mr Lewis’s former wife was secretly watched and filmed in
and around her Manchester home.

The messages provide fresh evidence of
desperate manoeuvring behind the scenes at the Sunday newspaper as the 
phone-hacking scandal unfolded.

News International admitted the newspaper had ordered the surveillance and branded it ‘deeply inappropriate’.

There are suspicions that the scale of 
the covert investigations was one factor in the eventual resignation of 
News International chief executive Rebekah Wade.

Mr Webb passed a dossier of evidence about his surveillance activities to Newsnight after falling out with the newspaper over a payment when it closed.

The former detective constable founded a private investigation agency, named Silent Shadow, after retiring in 2003.

He was soon hired by the Sunday  newspaper to follow and document the activities of scores of celebrities over the next eight years. He specialised in secretly filming his subjects and kept meticulous notes about their movements.

His most high-profile target was Prince William, who he followed during a visit to his father’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over several days in 2006. It is not known when Harry was followed, but the antics of the party-loving prince were a regular feature in the tabloid newspaper.

The surveillance operations raise uncomfortable questions for Scotland Yard protection officers charged with safeguarding the princes’ security and privacy.

Other targets are said to have included Lord Goldsmith, who was followed while he was attorney general, London mayor Boris Johnson, Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard, former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald, Paul McCartney and Lord Coe. Mr Webb also trailed the parents of Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe between 2009 and 2011.

Mr Webb said nine out of ten of those 
put under surveillance were celebrities or politicians. ‘I would write 
down what they were wearing at the time, what car  they were in, who 
they met, the location they met, the times,’ he said.

Details of the massive surveillance operation emerged after Mr Lewis disclosed that Scotland Yard detectives had handed him documents revealing how he was targeted early last year. The solicitor’s clients include the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, whose voicemails were hacked after she went missing in 2002.

His former wife was secretly filmed at
her Manchester home, and while visiting shops with her daughter. Mr 
Lewis plans to sue News International for breach of privacy.

Labour culture spokesman Harriet 
Harman said: ‘These revelations take the shame of the phone hacking 
scandal to a new low.’ A spokesman for Prince William declined to 
comment.

who represented victims of phone hacking, were allegedly tailed by a 
private investigator

News International has admitted it was ‘deeply inappropriate’ to put Mr Lewis and Miss Harris under surveillance and said the move was ‘not condoned by any current executives’. A spokesman added last night: ‘We are not able to make any comment around the specific work carried out by Derek Webb. As is well known, the News of the World was closed by News International during the summer.’

Mr Webb told Newsnight last night: ‘I used my 15 years of experience to evade the attention of royal protection officers. They didn’t rumble me, they had no idea.’

Jules Stenson, former head of features at News of the World, branded Mr Webb a ‘man with a grudge’.

‘All we are getting is one side of this from Derek Webb,’ he told Newsnight. ‘He’s clearly a man with a grudge who’s got a grievance against the company for not getting any compensation (when the paper closed). You are getting a very slanted story and you are not hearing any context to these investigations.’

A dossier compiled by private investigator Derek Webb reveals the names of 153 people allegedly targeted for surveillance by the News of the World between 2003 and 2011.

Here are the celebrities, politicians and other public figures said to have been singled out.

The list, obtained by Channel 4 News, does not include ordinary members of the public.
