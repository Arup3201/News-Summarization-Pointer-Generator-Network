Australia's iconic beaches have always been a source of fascination for surf photographers, and one native has made it his mission to find moments of perfection in Sydney's water no matter what it takes.

Shey Ivanov, 32, spends hours in the water every day in an attempt to capture elusive moments of beauty, often heading into the water after a long day at work just as other photographers are leaving.

Having gained a name for himself posting his stunning images on Instagram, Shey said that the responses he gets from his followers makes his efforts all worth while.

Curl Curl native Shey Ivanov captures waves as they crash onto the shores of Sydney beaches: this image was captured during a lightning storm that Shey 'had to be out in'

'I want to capture a moment, a microsecond of perfection, that might come out of hours of shooting,' Shey told Daily Mail Australia.

Working Monday to Friday as a picture framer 'to pay the bills', Shey has what he calls a 'full time hobby' in his water photography, building up a fan base on social media and his website.

His images, shot from the water using a Digital SLR Canon 5D Mark 3 in waterproof housing, capture moments of tranquility which Shey hopes will inspire positivity in people.

Growing up in Byron Bay, Shey said that he was 'basically born on the beach', and that it was inevitable that he would end up back in the water for his driving passion. 

'I always knew I'd end up back there, but Byron offered very little options- it tended to chew you up or spit you out, so I needed to get out of there.' 

After being inspired during his final school years by his sister's dabble with photography, Shey said he picked up a camera and never looked back. 

Relocating at the age of 21 to Curl Curl in Sydney's North Shore, Shey said he considers himself lucky to be able to live and work right near 'the best beach in Australia'.

While he admits that his style has changed over the past five years, Shey said the most significant change in his photography has been his ability to take pictures in any light.

'I use two flashes, which sets me apart from other people. I can be out in the almost dark and capture the rich colours of sunset, heading in to the water when other photographers are heading back on to the beach,' he said,  

This persistence and spirit of determination has seen Shey capture some of the most unique and striking images of his career.  

'You can go out in the worst conditions with grey skies, and can come back with gold- I'm in the water every afternoon for so many hours but I'm happy if I come out with one photo I love.' 

'My goal is to find pieces that everyone can relate to, whether they're an 80-year-old surfer or a 15-year-old out West.'

'As a surfer, waves are a big thing for me, but I've been moving towards capturing tranquility shots, ones that allow people to lose themselves in the photo and make them feel like they're there.'

Spending hours in the water in pursuit of these shots has meant that Shey has seen his fair share of strange and beautiful sights.

In 2012 Shey was out in the water taking photographs when he saw a 15 metre whale swimming right by him.

'I swam over, and he was sitting there, just floating around,' Shey said.

'I started taking photos, it was just unbelievable,' he said.

While he hopes he hasn't had a run-in with any ocean predators, Shey said that he's kicked things out in the water 'that you just pray aren't sharks'.  

One of his favourite images was captured during the lightning strikes which hailed down on Sydney earlier in the month.

Shey saw an evening storm start to roll in, complete with thunder and lightning, and knew he 'just had to be out there'.

'I was in the water taking photos and got the shot, and decided to stay in for a bit longer. One big bolt of lightning hit the water right next to me and I decided to get out,' Shey said. 

'Being 6ft 6 I was the tallest landmark on the beach and could feel the electric shocks zapping my neck from my wetsuit zipper,'

'I got down low and bolted, out of breath and almost collapsing as I reached the surf club. I don't know if it was the friction building up from me running in a rubber wetsuit or how close I actually came to being struck but that was close enough for me!'

'I think it's important to strive every day to be happy; life is a rollercoaster so enjoy it,' Shey said

Despite the scare, he said that the feedback he received on his Instagram made it all worth while. 

'Getting comments from people who are stocked with my photos just makes my day,' Shey said.

'I think it's important to strive every day to be happy; life is a rollercoaster so enjoy it while you're on it,' he said.

'I have a tattoo across my ribs that says 'enjoy the journey', and seeking the positive, and sharing that with other people is all part of that.'

For aspiring surf photographers, Shey said that keeping an open mind and being willing to take a chance is one of the biggest elements in finding 'gold'.

'One of the most important things I've learnt is that you can't wait for the perfect conditions to present themselves- go out and have an adventure, because you never know what you're going to get.' 

Accounts on Instagram which he uses for inspiration are other surf photographers, such as Warren Keelan, a photographer from Wollongong, and Willem Ungerman, from the Gold Coast.

Shey is also a big fan of Clarke Liddle, a surf photographer from Hawaii, but he said that 'everyone in the world has been inspired by him at some point.'

'Living in Hawaii, with crystal clear water and everything sitting in his backyard, he's one of a kind.'

'Anything that makes you happy should be your inspiration,' Shey said.
