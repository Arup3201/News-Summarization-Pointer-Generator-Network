A heartbroken mother has been ordered to get a DNA test carried out on her dead partner - so his name can be put on their baby daughter's birth certificate.

Sarah Dixon, from Little Hulton, Salford, lost her partner David Broome in a car smash last month, just weeks after their baby Shenayah was born.

But, because the couple were not married, she has been told that his name cannot be added to their nine-week-old baby's birth certificate unless she pays for a DNA test to prove that he was the father.

David Broome (pictured with his newborn daughter Shenayah) was fatally injured in a car accident in north Wales in October before he was able to sign his baby's birth certificate

The couple had planned to register the birth together just days before David's tragic death

The law states that unmarried parents need to sign the birth register together or get a court order proving you a parent.

Sarah will now have to pay in the region of £4,000 to take the fight to court and to pay for DNA to be analysed by a court appointed testing service.

Sarah, 25, said: 'We planned to register her together on the Monday and he died on the Wednesday before. I went to Salford register office and they said 'we need the father here to register the birth.' It broke my heart.

They told me they couldn't register the birth because we were not married.'

David's family have asked for toenail clippings and tissue samples to be taken from the coroner in north Wales, where the accident happened, as evidence that 26-year-old David was the father.

A petition signed by more than 1,500 people and a Facebook page Give Shenayah Broome Her Father's Name On Her Birth Certificate has now been launched.

Sarah added: 'We were together for three years so it was like we were married.

'He was at the birth, he went to all the scans and we were together for three years. He even cut the cord following the birth.

Sarah, 25, said it 'broke her heart' when she was told by Salford registery office that they would need the father present to register the birth

The loving father, from Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five

'I feel that this is punishing our baby.'

David died following the crash which also left his 18-year-old nephew Norman Gregory with leg and chest injuries.

The postman and DJ, from Irlams o' th' Height, Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five.

David, a former pupil at Buile Hill Visual Arts College, was a passenger in a Ford Ka driven by his nephew when it was in collision with a Skoda Octavia on the Nant Y Garth pass near Felinheli, in Gwynedd.

His funeral was held at St Thomas' Church, Pendleton and Agecroft Cemetery last Monday. 

Sarah was told she needs a DNA test to register her deceased partner David on their daughter's birth certificate as they were unmarried

All births in England must be registered at the local registry office or hospital within 42 days of the child being born.  

Within married couples, just one parent is able to register the birth and include both mother's and father's details.

But for unmarried couples, the law demands that mothers must provide proof of parentage unless both parents are present.

This can be in the form of a signed declaration of parentage form, or a court document, such as an order giving the father parental responsibility, or court ordered DNA test.

If these cannot be provided, the father's details won't be included on the birth certificate.

It can be possible to add the father's details at a later date by completing an application for the re-registration of a child's birth.

Where neither parents are able register the birth, a member of the administrative staff at the hospital where the child was born or someone present at the birth, are allowed to register on their behalf.
