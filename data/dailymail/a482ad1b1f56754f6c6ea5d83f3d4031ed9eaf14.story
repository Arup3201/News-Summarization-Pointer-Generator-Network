Nigel Farage has waded into the Top Gear racism row - insisting it was 'just typical Clarkson'.

The Ukip leader defended the 54-year-old after Jeremy Clarkson claimed he was on his final warning from the BBC and will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again.

Speaking as he unveiled an anti-immigration billboard, Mr Farage insisted the Top Gear presenter had not crossed the line.

Wading in: Jeremy Clarkson, who is under fire for footage (left) in which he 'appeared' to say the word n*****, has found an ally in Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right). Today Mr Farage said: 'It's just typical Clarkson'

He said: 'The more controversial Jeremy Clarkson is, the more 
people watch his programme, and the more money the BBC makes out of 
marketing a show that sells globally and makes them a fortune.

'I
 would think it's just typical Clarkson, getting very, very close to the
 line of being offensive but perhaps not quite going over it.'

Today Clarkson wrote in his weekly newspaper column that he did not want to apologise for 'appearing' to say n***** in unaired Top Gear footage, but the BBC made him.

And he said: 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked.

'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head.

'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.'

Controversy: Mr Farage was speaking as he unveiled an anti-immigration billboard in Dover, Kent

Mr Farage was correct to say Top Gear is one of the BBC's highest-earning shows.

Rights to air and mimic the motoring show, as well as merchandise and DVD sales, are exported around the globe through the Corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide.

The firm, which is owned by the BBC but is free to operate as a business, made a £156million profit in 2012/13 and Top Gear is usually cited as its biggest income stream.

Clarkson himself made an estimated £14million when the BBC took full control of Top Gear production company Bedder 6.

Since the move he was also rumoured to be the highest-paid presenter in the BBC.

The star became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using a nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media.

Defence: Mr Farage also had to admit his party had some 'idiots' after a candidate called David Cameron a 'gay-loving nutcase' and said Muslims were the children of the devil

Historically the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it.

In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead.

An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures.

Apology: Clarkson's video message this week

Mr Farage was speaking as he 
launched Ukip's billboard campaign for the European elections against the 
backdrop of the white cliffs of Dover.

The campaign poster features a 
picture of the famous landmark with an escalator running up the middle 
and the slogan: 'No border. No control. The EU has opened our borders to
 4,000 people every week.'

The poster adds: 'Take back control of our country.'

During the launch he was forced to admit Ukip had 'some idiots' after a row erupted over Stockport council election candidate Harry Perry.

On Twitter Mr Perry called for Pakistan to be 'nuked', dubbed David Cameron a 'gay-loving nutcase', Muslims 'devil's kids' and homosexuality an 'abomination before god'.

Mr Farage said: 'I've never heard of the bloke until last night. I've no idea who he is.

'I
 think he comes from the north west of England. Clearly his attitude and
 views are entirely inconsistent with being a member of Ukip. Simple.'

Mr Perry was suspended from the party today.

But Mr Farage claimed the media's reporting of what goes wrong in his party is 'completely disproportionate'.

He added: 'I could show you 14 elected councillors from the Lib Dem, Labour and Conservative parties who haven't just said nasty things they've been convicted this year of nasty things. And yet it never makes a national headline.'
