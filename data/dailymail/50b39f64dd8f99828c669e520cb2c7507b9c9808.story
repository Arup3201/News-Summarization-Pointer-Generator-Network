Two compounds at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea have been barricaded by groups of asylum seekers who are not allowing staff to enter.

ABC News reported on Sunday that protesters in the Delta and Oscar compounds of the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre placed boxes in front of gates to keep out security staff and government officials.

‘People in Delta compound fear (the) guards,’ one asylum seeker said.

However, security staff have reportedly rounded up who they consider to be the ring leaders and put them in a high-security isolation unit.

Refugee advocates say Transfield riot officers raided early on Sunday a compound seizing leaders of the protest in which hundreds of men are on hunger or water strike at the Australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre. While about 30 other asylum seekers have sewn their lips together.

‘The riot squad attempted to force water down the throat of two unconscious asylum seekers in the compound,’ Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said in a statement.

‘They also threatened that a special forces unit will come from Port Moresby 'to deal with you' unless the hunger strike was ended by this morning.’ 

Deputy premier Warren Truss could not confirm those reports on Sunday, but said new Immigration Minister Peter Dutton would be seeking to do that.

'Minister Dutton has made a number of statements about what he believes to be happening at the present time. The flow of information is not always reliable,' Mr Truss told AAP in Brisbane. 

The security personnel were reportedly rounding up who they considered to be the ring leaders 

The refugees said they were being denied food and water and have sent photos of men burrowing beneath a fence to reach crates of bottled water placed just outside the compound. 

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Dutton said the government had been ‘advised that food and water continue to be available’.

‘However, normal services and supplies in certain areas of the centre have been affected by the disruptive behaviour of some transferees. Normal services are ready to resume in those areas as soon as the situation allows,’ the spokesman said.

On Sunday, the Refugee Action Coalition also published a letter it said was signed by 80 asylum seekers in Foxtrot compound.

‘Here a disaster is about to happen, please prevent this disaster,’ the letter read.

‘The Australian Government is planning to resettle us in PNG against our will, by forcing us.

‘We are not willing to be resettled in PNG because there is no safety [or] any future for us and our family.

‘Today we consider us to be hostage for the Australian Government so they can deter others not to come to Australia.’

Asylum seekers' bedding lies on the ground where their hunger strike is taking place 

The protests, which began on Tuesday, were apparently sparked by plans to transfer some of the 50 men given refugees status to a transit centre near the main town of Manus Island.

He said the government wanted to ensure that people in those centres were appropriately cared for.

But Mr Truss reiterated that people who arrived by boat without a visa would not be resettled in Australia.

'You won't be able to get your way into this country through some kind of illegal people smuggling operation or by, for that matter, put up an argument that somehow or other you are being badly treated now and therefore should be granted access to this country,' he said. 

However, Mr Rintoul said taking leaders hostage or sending in the riot squad would not stop the hundreds of hunger strikers.
