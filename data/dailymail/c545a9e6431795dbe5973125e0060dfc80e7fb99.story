A new social hotspot is taking New York by storm this New Year's Day, offering up effective hangover cures to ailing revelers - from inside a bus.

The suitably-named Hangover Bus is a mobile lounge in which sore-headed party-goers can seek sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, while also enjoying a vitamin-infused IV drip which promises to rid them of all their hangover symptoms. 

Created by New York-based company the Hangover Club, the bus, which will be stationed outside of popular nightspot Bounce Sporting Nightclub on West 21st Street until 7pm this evening, comes complete with a team of trained nurses who administer the drips and offer additional medical advice to anyone who needs it.

Help is here: The Hangover Club's new mobile lounge is already proving to be one of New York's most popular destinations 

A complete cure: Customers can choose from a concise menu of vitamin drips, all of which include painkillers and vitamin infusions

'We like to call it the "whoops!" button,' Hangover Club nurse Lynnette Ayuso told the New York Village Voice. 

'People do drink and unfortunately sometimes we go a little overboard and the aftermath is feeling very dehydrated... essentially, what your body needs is cellular hydration. 

'The IV fluid is going directly into your bloodstream and replenishing the thirsty cells in your body.'

The IV drips - which can also be infused with painkillers and anti-nausea medication at the nurses' discretion - don't come cheap, however.

According to the New York Post, the drips, which take about 40 minutes, are being offered at a discount on the bus. 

The Classic, which includes hydration and nausea or pain medication, is priced at $129 (full price $175), the Super, which also includes a vitamin B booster, is $149 (full price $219) and the Mega, which contains a detox and vitamin C booster is a whopping $169 (full price &249).

Drip life: Prior to launching the Hangover Bus, the company delivered custom IV drips to its clients at their homes

Anyone with a slightly smaller budget can also opt for a half-bag option, which costs $79. 

And it's not just IV drips that the bus is serving up. 

Customers are also given free access to Bounce Nightclub, where they can enjoy a selection of New Year's Day football, screenings of The Hangover and a variety of delicious hangover foods such as mac and cheese, Parmesan truffle fries and pigs-in-pretzels.

Given that the bus can only fit 15 people inside at any one time - although it is equipped with enough IV drips to serve more than 200 hangover sufferers - the space of the nearby nightclub will no doubt come in handy. 

Prior to launching the Hangover Bus, the Hangover Club delivered custom IV drips to its clients at their homes. 

Following today's successful debut however, the company has announced that the Hangover Bus will be stationed at a different nightclub every Sunday in order to cater to the swathes of struggling revelers who are in need desperate need of its services.
