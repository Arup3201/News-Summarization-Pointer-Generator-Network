A council has been fined £150,000 for losing unencrypted laptops containing personal data and bank account details of more than 20,000 people.

Two computers were stolen from Glasgow City Council premises in a breach of the Data Protection Act.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which issued the fine, found that the building was insecure because it was being refurbished and there had previously been complaints about a lack of security.

'Beggars belief': A council has been fined £150,000 over the theft of 
unencrypted laptops containing personal data of 20,000 people, one of 
which was left in an unlocked drawer with a key to another drawer

One laptop had been locked away in its storage drawer, but the key placed in an unlocked drawer with the other computer.

This allowed the thief to access both devices during the raid on May 28 last year.

One of the laptops held the council's creditor payment history file, containing the personal information of 20,143 people, including the bank account details of 6,069 individuals.

Employees had asked for these laptops to be encrypted, but the council had not done so, it was reported by the BBC.

The ICO also discovered that a further 74 unencrypted laptops were missing, six of which had been stolen.

Despite its previous warning and in breach of its own policy, the council had given a number of staff unprotected laptops after having problems with encryption software, although most of these were later encrypted the ICO revealed.

'Flagrant disregard for the law': Glasgow City Council (above) had been issued with an enforcement notice three years ago after an unencrypted memory stick containing personal information had gone missing

The findings come after the council had 
been issued with an enforcement notice three years ago when an 
unencrypted memory stick containing personal information went missing.

Ken
Macdonald, the ICO's assistant commissioner for Scotland said it 
'beggars belief' that the council failed to notice the disappearance of 
74 computers.

He said: 'The fact that these laptops have never been recovered, and no record was made of the information stored on them, means that we will probably never know the true extent of this breach, or how many people's details have been compromised.'

He said the fact the breach followed an enforcement notice in 2010 showed 'a flagrant disregard for the law and the people of Glasgow.'

The ICO has ordered the council to carry out a full audit of its IT assets used to process personal data and a full check of all of its devices each year so that the asset register can be updated.

A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: 'This data loss should not have happened and we took immediate steps to ensure it does not happen again.'
