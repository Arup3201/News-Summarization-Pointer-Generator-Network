An 87-year-old has forgiven the fraudster who swindled £7,500 of her pension money by pretending to have throat cancer - and is now desperate to see him again. 

Margaret Hounslea, from Merseyside, even wants to overturn the restraining order placed on conman Terence Dixon, despite the fact he has fleeced her twice for money.

Dixon, 53, was jailed for 27 months in November  and ordered not to contact his victim until 2019.

Margaret Hounslea, 87 (left), from Wallasey, Merseyside, wants to overturn a restraining order imposed on Terence Dixon (right), despite the fact he stole £7,500 of her pension money by pretending to have cancer

The court heard it was the second time Dixon - whom Mrs Hounslea refers to as her 'grandson' - had been sent to prison for stealing money from her.

But Mrs Hounslea, who spent her life visiting prisons to rehabilitate criminals, wants the order removed so she can be reunited with her 'friend'.

Without children of her own, the retired scientist keeps a 'bedroom' for Dixon at home and has kept a framed photo on him on top of her TV since the pair met 27 years ago.

The Ministry of Justice has now indicated that Mrs Hounslea could have the ban overturned, but would need to make a fresh legal bid to lift it in front of the same judge who imposed the order.

She said: 'Yes, he has misbehaved. He shouldn't have told me he had cancer. He'll get the sharp end of my tongue when I see him next. 

'But I'm being punished as much as he is. He was my shopper, the person who changed the lightbulbs, who did jobs in the house. He cut my hedge.

'I still regard him as my grandson. I want the prohibition order lifted so he can come home.

She added: 'I won't be alive in five years' time. I miss him. I need a friend.' 

The pensioner, who spent her life visiting prisons, calls Dixon her 'grandson' and says she misses him 

Dixon was jailed in November last year after it emerged that he had persuaded Mrs Hounslea to transfer up to £80 a week into his bank account, leaving her with just £35 a week to live on.

He claimed he was penniless, but in reality was receiving £630 a month in state benefits and living with his wife. 

The court heard how Dixon, who had started relying on her for money in 2007, also once arrived at Mrs Hounslea's home  and found she had  been lying on the floor for a day after a bad fall. 

But, callously, he just put her in a rocking chair with a bottle of water and biscuits and left her there alone, saying he had to dash to London for more cancer treatment.

Two days later, he contacted Mrs Hounslea's friend, who arrived to find the pensioner dehydrated. Dixon turned up briefly but then left, claiming he had to rush off for an operation to remove half his liver.

It was while the pensioner was in hospital that the friend raised suspicions about Dixon. When interviewed by police, he admitted he had mistakenly allowed her to believe he had cancer but had actually used her money to buy clothes and fund his lifestyle. 

After pleading guilty in November to the fraud, Dixon was lambasted by a judge who told him: 'You are frankly a disgrace.

'I hope you are ashamed till the day you die. She is a very pleasant, compassionate lady.'

But Mrs Hounslea said: 'He shouldn't tell lies, but it's not criminal. I would have happily given him that money if he needed it.

'I wouldn't have gone into prisons, and done that job, if I didn't have forgiveness for people. We are all sinners. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.'

Mrs Hounslea met Dixon while working at HMP Spring Hill in Buckinghamshire and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship. 

The former school laboratory technician said: 'When I met Terry, the prison officer mistakenly referred to me as his gran, and that was the start.

'I told him, "OK, I'll be your grandmother".' 

But Dixon, who has various convictions for dishonesty, betrayed her trust in 2006 by stealing two cheques from her and cashing them in for £180.

He was jailed for the fraud but Mrs Hounslea forgave him and their friendship continued.  

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Decisions on varying or discharging such orders are for judges and magistrates, who will make their decision based on the full facts of the individual case they are hearing.'
