German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the opening of an exhibition at the Hermitage has been cancelled by Russia, reportedly because she planned to mention art 'looted' by the Soviets at the end of World War II.

Thousands artworks were taken from Germany by the Soviet Union, with hundreds of pieces of 'trophy art' taken as war reparations held in the St Petersburg museum.

Merkel is on a visit to an economic forum in the city and had planned to join President Vladimir Putin at the opening of the exhibition 'The Bronze Age of Europe: Europe Without Borders'.

Cancelled: The German Chancellor will no longer be attending the opening of an exhibition at the Hermitage in St Petersburg

But German government spokesman Georg 
Streiter said Russia had called off the event arguing that 'it was 
impossible for the host to find the time'.

Asked what Merkel had planned to say 
when she inaugurated the show, he said: 'She would perhaps have 
once more referred to the German position on the issue of "looted art".'

Mr Streiter added: 'The opening of the 
exhibition would have been a lovely occasion to highlight our close 
cultural cooperation.'

Germany's media has run headlines including 'Uproar about looted art', 'Putin is a miserable diplomat' and 'Looted art scandal overshadows Russia trip' and has referred to the incident as a sign of deteriorating relations between the two countries.

According to Berlin's Humboldt 
University, the Soviets plundered more than a million books and 
thousands of pieces of 'Beutekunst' - or 'looted art' - at the end of 
the Second World War.

Hundreds of pieces of art were taken by Soviet soldiers from Germany at the end of the Second World War.

Many were kept in storage for more than 50 years, with several being kept behind closed doors at the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, including masterpieces by Goya, Delacroix, Courbet, Domier, Degas, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, 
Cezanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse and Purrmann.

In the early 1990s the Hermitage began exhibiting the 'trophy art', saying the works should be made accessible to the public before decisions could be made about their future.

The works have been a contentious issue between Germany and Russia, with scholars divided over whether they were stolen or saved by Soviet troops.

Many pieces have still not been traced down and Germany has indicated it wants the art back.

The Hermitage holds many 'trophy art' items removed by the Soviet Union which Germany is keen to see returned.

The exhibition opens to the public on Saturday, the anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union.

Tension between Berlin and Moscow was apparent when Putin visited the Hanover trade fair in April.

Merkel, who grew up in communist East Germany, criticised his crackdown on foreign non-governmental organisations, saying: 'A lively civil society can only emerge when individuals can operate without fear or worry, of course on the basis of law.'

Her foreign minister, the openly gay Guido Westerwelle, has also protested about a new Russian law against homosexual 'propaganda'.

But Germany has to maintain good ties with Russia because of its dependency on the country's natural gas resources.

Merkel has said maintaining a dialogue is the best way to improve civil rights in Russia.
