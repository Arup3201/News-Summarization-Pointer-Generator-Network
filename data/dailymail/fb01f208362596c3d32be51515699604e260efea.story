Fabio Borini is the subject of an £8million bid from Sunderland as they attempt to lure back last season’s loan star to Wearside.

The Liverpool striker spent the entirety of the last campaign at the Stadium of Light and became a favourite after netting crucial goals in their fight against Premier League relegation.

Gus Poyet’s side eventually steered their way clear of danger, thanks in part to the Italian’s contribution up front alongside Connor Wickham.

And they want the 23-year-old to spearhead their attack when the new term starts next month.

That is made a slightly more realistic prospect given Brendan Rodgers’ summer courting of other forwards – notably Alexis Sanchez and the young Belgian Divick Origi – as the Reds brace themselves for the departure of Luis Suarez.

Borini has become a top target for Poyet after scoring in both Tyne-Wear derbies and putting them ahead against Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final. He was also was voted Sunderland’s young player of the year.

The player’s agent Marco De Marchi said earlier this month: ‘I would not be surprised if there were other clubs who want him, because I consider him a complete striker.

‘But for the moment, all I can say with certainty is that Fabio has returned to Liverpool to stay.’
