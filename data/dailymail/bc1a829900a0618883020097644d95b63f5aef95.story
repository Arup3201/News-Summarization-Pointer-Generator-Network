When British tourist Georgia Stephens went kayaking with her boyfriend she enjoyed a visit from an unexpected stowaway - a friendly seal.

Georgia, 22, from Woodford, Essex, was paddling with Martin Coppins, 25, in the Abel Tasman National Park in New Zealand when the mammal leapt out of the water onto the end of her kayak.

The couple caught the entire encounter, in the sea near Adele Island, on camera.

Georgia, who is training to become a publisher, said: 'I didn't know what to do because the seal had approached me and didn't seem scared at all.

'It started edging towards me, which I didn't really like because the locals told us not to go within 20 metres of the area's fur seals, as they can bite.

'I was quite scared but then it started to sniff around in my hair and touched my face.

'It also kept putting its face into the water as though it was looking for something.

Visitor: Georgia said that the seal sat on the end of the kayak and kept looking down into the water as if it were searching for something

'Eventually it slid back into the water and came around to the front, and tried to jump back onto the kayak between me and Martin.

'It tried about three times but kept failing because it was too high.

She added: 'It kept swimming around us for a few minutes more, before quickly disappearing back towards the rocks of the island.'

Georgia posted the video online and some followers commented that a shark can be seen in one part of her film, but Georgia and Martin, who works in hospitality, are unsure.

Georgia said: 'I'm not sure myself because I was concentrating on the seal.

'But it would give a good reason for the seal jumping onto my kayak.'
