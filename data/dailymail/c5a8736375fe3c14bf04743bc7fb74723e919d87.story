A new twist to the traditional nativity saw Joseph get down on one knee to propose to Mary in front of hundreds of amazed on-lookers.

Romantic Gareth Yardley made the proposal as he starred in a live nativity in Hull, East Yorkshire.

The 31-year-old popped the question to Lyndsey Holmes, who was playing Mary in the nativity, while their 11-week-old son Sidney slept in a nearby manger while playing the starring role of Jesus.

Proposal: Gareth Yardley proposed to girlfriend Lyndsey Holmes while the two performed in a nativity, which featured their son as baby Jesus

New twist: Joseph pops the question in front of hundreds of onlookers, left, at the end of the nativity in Hull which left Miss Holmes speechless

Miss Holmes, 25, was left speechless by the proposal which took place in the middle of the Nativity Live! event, outside Holy Trinity Church, in Hull.

Mr Yardley said: 'I only told a few people and we wanted to make sure it happened and I'm glad she said "yes".

'It was the perfect setting to propose.'

Nativity Live! recreated the Christmas story with actors, real animals and even newborn baby boy Sidney.

After a procession down through the city - where there was no room at either the Bonny Boat or the Kingston Inn for the Holy couple - the baby was eventually born in a stable outside Holy Trinity Church.

A choir of angels sang carols with the gathered crowds before the glittering star of Bethlehem was hoisted on a cherry picker above the stable, where 10-week old baby Sidney Yardley took on the starring role of Jesus.

Setting: Mr Yardley only told a few people of his plan before he made the proposal

Sealed with a kiss: The tale had a happy ending as Miss Holmes agreed to marry Mr Yardley
