The traditional clock has had its day.

A German creator has designed a robot that writes the time using a dry wipe pen on a miniature white board.

Its mechanical arms then erase the time from this board, before starting again - and each time the robot writes, the numbers correspond to the real-world time as its being written.

The Plotclock, pictured, was designed by Thingiverse member Joo, also known as Johannes from Nuremburg. It writes the time, in hours and minutes, on a white board using a dry wipe pen, before erasing it and starting again

To make the Plotclock, users will need:

A laser cutter or 3D printer

1 Arduino Uno board

3 servos

1 dry wipe pen

A piece of white board

M3 nuts, bolts, thread tape

Instructions, with pictures, can be downloaded from Thinigverse.

Dubbed Plotclock, the contraption only displays hours and minutes in 24-hour clock, meaning that the time it takes to write the numbers doesn’t cause a delay. 

The contraption was designed by Thingiverse member Joo, also known as Johannes from Nuremburg.

Plotclock is made up of 3D printed parts and mechanisms, connected by M3 nuts, bolts and thread tape.

It is powered by an Arduino Uno board and three servos control and manage the movement of its arms.

Joo’s Plotclock is just the latest in a line of 21st century redesigns of the traditional and digital clock.

The Hippocampus clock - named after the part of the brain responsible for spatial navigation and long-term-memory - was unveiled at the M.A.D (Mechanical Art Devices) Gallery in Geneva last year. 

The contraption only displays hours and minutes in 24-hour clock, meaning that the time it takes to write the time doesn't cause a delay

Standing 2.8m tall, it displays the time via two ‘retrograde’ indicators, so named because the hands travel in one direction before snapping back to the start, rather than rotating.

The one to the left shows the minutes; the one to the right the hours.

More recently, Japanese firm Tokyoflash designed a watch that displays the time in the form of Hermann Rorschach inkblots, whereas the Durr watch, from Oslo-based designers, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, vibrates at five minute intervals, but doesn’t show the actual time.
