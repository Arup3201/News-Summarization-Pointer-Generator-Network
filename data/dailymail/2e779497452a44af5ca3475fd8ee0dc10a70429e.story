How do you keep track of your cat’s health and well-being even when not at home?

This £65 ($100) smart cat scale claims to be the answer, providing alerts on what your pet has been up to and monitoring their health, weight and waste.

And the device will also be used to see if it’s true that cats can detect oncoming earthquakes.

A San Diego-based company has designed a smart litter box for cats (pictured). Called Tailio the internet-enabled scale is placed under a regular box. It then sends information on a cat's habits to a smartphone app. It can monitor the health and weight of a cat and provides alerts

Called Tailio, the device was developed by company Pet Wireless in San Diego, California and has already reached its funding goal on Kickstarter.

It is placed under a regular cat litter box and, when a cat climbs in to do their business, it tracks the weight of the cat and its time in the box.

And it’s sensitive enough to measure the change in weight of the cat and box when the animal climbs in and out.

The belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters – and even the weather - has been around for centuries.

In 373 BC, historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes and weasels, deserted the Greek city of Helice in droves just days before a quake devastated the place.

Accounts of similar animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the centuries since, such as catfish moving violently, chickens that stop laying eggs and bees leaving their hive in a panic.

Precisely what animals sense is a mystery, but one theory is that wild and domestic creatures feel the Earth vibrate before humans. Other ideas suggest they detect electrical changes in the air or gas released from the Earth. 

In March 2012, fishermen in Japan reported a sharp increase in oarfish sightings following the massive magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile that same month, which marked almost exactly one year before the country was devastated by its own magnitude-8.9 quake in northeast Japan. 

The device syncs with a smartphone app on iOS and Android so that, when out and about, owners can see what their cat has been up to.

It can also monitor multiple cats and provide information on how often each one is visiting the litter box.

If it notices irregularities in a cat’s behaviour it can share information with a vet to diagnose and treat the cat.

‘Tailio will alert you if they haven't shown up to the litter box in their usual routine, so you can see what may be needed,’ the company writes.

Tailio will also show trends over time to see if any pre-set weight loss goals are being met.

Perhaps most interestingly, though, the company will use Tailio to see if cats have a ‘sixth sense’ when it comes to the natural world.

‘For instance, since ancient times many people have believed cats can somehow sense impending earthquakes hours or even days in advance,’ they write.

Tailio has been awarded a grant by the National Science Foundation to in particular monitor the behaviour of cats along southern California fault lines.

The team will look for clues to see if there is a correlation between changes in animal behaviour and seismic activity.

The company is taking pre-orders for Tailio now, and expects to begin shipping in April 2015.

The belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters - and even the weather - has been around for centuries, and Tailio will also be used to see if cats can predict earthquakes. The team has a grant from the National Science Foundation to see if the pets have an ability to sense natural disasters

The device is Wi-Fi enabled so that all of its data can be synced. It is also easy to clean and has a splash resistant surface, while the non-slip mat ensures the litter box will not slide of the scale when the cat climbs in to do its business
