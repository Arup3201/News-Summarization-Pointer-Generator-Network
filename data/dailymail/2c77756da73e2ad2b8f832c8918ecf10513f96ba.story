Everton have agreed a deal to sign Chelsea midfielder Christian Atsu on a season-long loan deal, according to manager Roberto Martinez.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the Toffees had arranged for the Ghana international to spend the 2014/15 campaign at Goodison Park, something Martinez has now confirmed.

The details of the loan agreement have been sorted between the two clubs, with a work permit the only thing preventing Atsu from becoming Everton's fifth signing of the summer.

Martinez told the Liverpool Echo: 'Everything has been agreed with Christian - it's just a matter of finalising little details more with his work permit and personal situation.

'That will probably take a couple of days to get sorted but we have an agreement in principle to make the move as a loan deal until the end of the season.'

Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, will join new recruits Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway. 

The 22-year-old could be eligible to face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium this weekend, but he will be unable to face Chelsea when Jose Mourinho's side visit Merseyside on August 30.

Martinez is also in the hunt for a new striker before the transfer window closes and the former Wigan boss admits that his search for reinforcements could go down to the wire.

'We'll take every day we have left in the window just to assess what we have in the squad and I'm happy with what we have,' he added.

'I would say we will take right until the last moment.'
