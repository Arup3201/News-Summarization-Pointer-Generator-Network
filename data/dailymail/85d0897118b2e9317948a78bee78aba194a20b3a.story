Bereaved loved ones of the deceased looking for a unique take on the classic funeral service are increasingly taking advantage of showmen pallbearers who march, dance and twirl the casket toward its final resting place.

These lively professionals lend a decided different air to the traditionally somber ceremony, but they could come at a steep price.

While some funeral homes offer the service, which is more common in the American South, free with a funeral, others charge as much as $1,400 a show.

Lively: Bereaved loved ones of the deceased looking for a unique take on the classic funeral service are increasingly taking advantage of something unique--dancing pallbearers

Stepping it up: The pallbearers in this show march in, wearing all white, and approach the casket in a synchronized dance

Can be pricey: The unique show is offered free of charge at some funeral homes, but others charge upwards of $1,500

John B. Houston funeral homes in New Jersey and New York have been offering the unique services, in which eight impeccably dressed gentleman synchronize movements like spinning around with the casket on their shoulders, since 2010.

That's when owner John Houston witnessed the spectacle at legendary performer Lena Horne's funeral.

'Itâ€™s show business,' Houston told ABC News.

The Alabama native said he was accustomed to the showier funerals of the South and looked to his gym trainer to help him recruit some strong-armed gentlemen to become his home's 'White Glove' pallbearers.

The White Glove service is now a staple at his homes, where around 1 in 10 'upper echelon' clients request it.

Showmen: The mourners may even give the dancers a round of applause, like this group did as the dancers bowed to the deceased

Final resting place: The men take the body to the hearse and depending on the ceremony will do their choreography once more as they carry the casket to its grave

'They raise the casket, basically shoulder it at the end of the service from the top of the church down the aisle, and put the body in the hearse,' said owner john Houston. 'Then they accompany the hearse, walking. Then, depending on the service, they may do the same thing at the cemetery, shoulder the casket to the grave.'

The pallbearers often dance in unison to gospel music, with one of them men leading as a sort of 'drillmaster.'

Houston told ABC that the service is offered to everyone, but that it's African Americans who generally opt for it.
