They are a world removed from what most would consider high culture.

But that did not stop hundreds of people attending a serious academic conference - on the MTV series ‘Jersey Shore’.

The day long event featured heavyweight speakers discussing the gender politics of Snooki and the morality and ethics of The Situation and Jwoww.

Attendees also debated the ‘sociolinguistic’ significance of the series and whether or not it pandered to stereotypes of ‘Guidos’, or Italian-Americans.

Among the lectures was one called: ‘The Jersey Saga: Honour Culture in Medieval Iceland and Modern Seaside’.

Another debate was given the title: ‘"Pickles Is My Thing": Snooki and the Ascendancy of Ordinary Celebrity’.

'Pickles Is My Thing' is Snooki's catchphrase in the hit reality series.

According to the New York Times there were around 50 submissions from top academics of which half were chosen to go before the audience of professors and graduate and undergraduate students.

The first keynote address was from Alison Hearn, an associate professor at the University of Western Ontario, who talked about ‘the branded hybrid person-character’ and entrepreneurship in Jersey Shore.

Her speech was titled: ‘The Monetization of Being: Reputational Labour, Brand Culture, and Why "Jersey Shore" Does, and Does Not, Matter.’

Meanwhile: A day after academics debated her gender politics, Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi was at Pure nightclub inside the Caesars Hotel in Las Vegas on Saturday

Other talks on the day included ‘Platonic Justice and "Jersey Shore" '"You're Not Even Italian": Stereotype, Authenticity, and the Warped Reality of "Jersey Shore"' and ‘Foucault's Going To The Jersey Shore, Bitch!’

The conference, which took place on Friday and lasted from 9am to 8pm, was put together by David Showalter, a senior at the University of Chicago.

During his opening speech he admitted Jersey Shore was an obsession of his own and claimed that it was ‘exceptionally good to think with’.

He has previously said he is wary of academics ‘restricting heir work to so-called "high culture", but to seriously engage with popular culture as well’.

All the lectures were free and open to the public. It was paid for by funding from the university which had been secured by Mr Showalter.

Not everyone has agreed with the project, however, and late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel mocked the idea of it even taking place.

He has said: ‘The University of Chicago is hosting an academic conference called "Jersey Shore Studies".

‘Meanwhile in Korea, students are learning something called "math".'
