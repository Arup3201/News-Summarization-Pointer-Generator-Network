The 9-year-old boy fatally stabbed in a Michigan playground on Monday spent his dying breaths telling his brother he loved him and re-assuring him that the shocking attack wasn’t his fault, a family member has revealed.

Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke was playing with two of his brothers and another boy Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, who pulled out a knife and repeatedly stabbed Connor.

The boy's great-uncle Jim Stearns told MLive that the horrific incident had left the family ‘absolutely numb’.

He said Connor had told his brother: ‘If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you,’ as the boy had rushed his dying brother back to their parent’s house in Kentwood.

Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home

Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back

‘Their
 top priority right now is the mental health of their three remaining 
children,’ Stearns said of the devastated Verkerke family.

A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday’s deadly attack. About 100 people gathered to celebrate Connor's memory.

Children
 and adults both laughed and cried during the vigil, reports MLive before Stearns, who is the uncle of Connor's mom, 
spoke to the crowd and everyone joined in to sing Jesus 
Loves Me.

Community
 members honored Connor's memory with teddy bears, passed out by vigil 
organizers, placed next to a cross on the side of the playground.

Stearns
 said the incident has 'terrorized' the park for kids - in particular, 
two of Connor’s brothers who were with him when the attack occurred. 'They’re afraid,' he said.

The Verkerke family were also concerned about the Jamarion Lawhorn's family.

'Even though 
we’re dealing with a different type of pain, they’ll be dealing with a 
similar pain every day for the rest of their lives. That’s not to be 
taken lightly,' said Stearns.

The community has some together to help Conner's mom pay for his funeral. A Go Fund Me page set up yesterday has already raised more than $13,000 from 321 people. 

The Grand Rapids Press
 reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on 
Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to 
try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' 
and younger than his age. 

His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him.

Shocking:
 Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an 
adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young
 for his age

Jamarion's lawyer entered a 'not guilty' plea and asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. 

The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him.

Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. 

Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. 

Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife

Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground

Suddenly, 
he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in 
the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the 
weapon. 

Conner
 ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken 
to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. 

 Authorities
 say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent 
County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 
11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 
in Pontiac, Michigan.

Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime.

Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.'

He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him.

The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press.

He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy.

'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived.

When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.
