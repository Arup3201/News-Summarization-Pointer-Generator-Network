A smirking thug who ran up and kicked his victim's head 'like taking a penalty kick' at a music festival has been jailed.  

Leon Wong, 32, was caught on mobile phone footage running at victim Jordan Holmes and kicking him  in the face at the Parklife Weekender in Heaton Park, Manchester, in June.

He had already punched Mr Holmes in the face prior to the kick, and went on to attack his friend Andrew Bartholomew when he tried to intervene.

Wong, from Widnes, who appeared to be smirking in his police mugshot, admitted causing actual and grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing at Manchester Crown Court and has now been jailed for 18 months. 

He had fled the scene after the attack - jumping into a stranger's car before asking them to get him away from the scene.

However, he was found after the couple saw appeals for information about an unrelated suspected murder at the festival on the same day and contacted police.  

Wong's blood was found in the vehicle and though he was not connected to the death of festival-goer Robert Hart - who died after he was punched at the event, he was linked to assaults on Mr Holmes and Mr Bartholomew.

Crown Square court was told Wong had been talking to a woman in the Kaluki tent at Parklife, on Friday June 7, when he was attacked by two men.

He then mistakenly believed Mr Holmes and Mr Bartholomew were responsible - and launched his own savage attack.

Mr Holmes lost four of his teeth, and both men suffered facial injuries in the attack, which one witness described as if Wong was running up to take a penalty kick.

Charles Langley, mitigating, said his client had been 'disgusted and shocked' when shown footage of his actions, which happened in a 'moment of madness'.

But Judge Robert Atherton told Wong: 'If ever there was a case of violence begetting violence this is it.

'A punch would have been one thing but I think the description given that it looks like someone running up to take a penalty kick at a football is much more accurate.

'That's what struck me and someone present and the ball is the head, that could've caused very serious injuries. This could easily have been a case in which someone's life was lost.' 

Wong, who has ten previous convictions for offences including common assault, possession of heroin and perverting the course of justice, pleaded guilty to one charge of actual bodily harm and one of grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing.  

He was jailed for 18 months for the attack on Mr Holmes and four months for the attack on Mr Bartholomew, to run concurrently.
