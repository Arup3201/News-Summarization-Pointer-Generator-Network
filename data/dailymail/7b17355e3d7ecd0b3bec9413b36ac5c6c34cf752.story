The statement he made summed up the rivalry. In September 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson was asked about the great challenge Manchester United were facing at that particular time.

'My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their ******* perch,' he responded. 'And you can print that.'

He eventually realised his ambition, in May 2011, when United secured their 19th league title. It might have been symbolic for the general public but, speaking from a Liverpool perspective, there was no dwelling on what they achieved. Our focus was on how we could turn the situation around.

But on the eve of Liverpool's latest trip to Old Trafford, I think about Ferguson's words and find myself asking questions: are Liverpool ever going to knock Manchester United off their  perch? Or has a glorious opportunity been squandered?

When Ferguson retired, a door opened for Liverpool. He was an empire on his own, one of the biggest influences on football this country has seen but, suddenly, his departure transformed things. There was a glimmer of light to exploit.

Look at what happened: Liverpool beat United twice, the second time being with the most emphatic performance I can remember a Liverpool team producing at Old Trafford. They were even awarded three penalties that day – would that have happened with Ferguson in the dugout?

So it was crucial Liverpool made the right steps following that thumping 3-0 victory in March; first by winning the league and then, crucially, with successful player recruitment. Doing that would have made things difficult for United – who had not ended up below Liverpool in the table for 12 years – to get back into the Champions League at the first chance.

Yet here we are on December 13, exactly seven months after the last campaign ended, and United are back on the front foot, third in the table. They are an average side, compared to Ferguson's teams of the past, but being in transition has not hindered their ambitions.

In adding Angel di Maria and Luke Shaw, United bought the better players. Liverpool may have spent more than £100million but where has it left them? And when will they be able to lavish such a figure again? Looking at them now, you feel they need another £100m spending just to improve.

Once you begin to examine the respective finances of both clubs, you see the extent of the power behind United. Their recently published accounts showed they brought in revenue of £433.2m in 2013-14. Liverpool's, by comparison, was £206.1m.

Old Trafford, with 30,000 more seats, is a money-making machine. Yes, Liverpool are getting a fantastic new Main Stand, which will be ready in August 2016, but it will take time for benefits to be felt. While Anfield is being revamped, United's £750m kit deal with adidas will kick in.

When you consider all that, it proves United could – if they desire – spend £100m every summer. Liverpool have never had that luxury and it feels like, once again, they have handed their most bitter rivals a 'get out of jail free' card.

It keeps happening. When we finished second to Arsenal in 2002, the next step was to win the league. We were outstanding in the cups, as our treble in 2001 showed, and we had beaten United in five consecutive games over two campaigns. The right moves would have given us a great chance.

Instead, we bought El Hadji Diouf, Bruno Cheyrou and Salif Diao for £20m, all of whom failed. That same summer, United paid £29.3m to smash the British transfer record for Rio Ferdinand, Ferguson fixed his defence and, 12 months later, they were champions.

United have an ability to land 'star' names with Di Maria offering the latest proof. In my time at Liverpool, it was all about developing players to become stars yet surely last summer was the moment for them to show they could compete at the highest transfer level?

Rafa Benitez used to say Liverpool had 'to be perfect' when buying players to compete with United but he made mistakes, just like Gerard Houllier did before and all the others who succeeded him. When that keeps happening, is it any surprise a gulf exists between the clubs?

History shows the dominance in this rivalry goes in cycles. United, with the Busby Babes and three league titles, were the teams of the 1950s. They added a European Cup in 1968 but Liverpool, during the Sixties, were a becoming an irresistible force under Bill Shankly.

That led to Liverpool's total superiority in the 1970s and 1980s before it swung again, with United and Ferguson dominating the Premier League era. This conflict has always ebbed and flowed and achievements are evenly matched; Liverpool have 59 major trophies. United have 58.

Without Ferguson, though, they looked vulnerable. They experienced great change at a number of levels, first with David Moyes and then Louis van Gaal, and had Liverpool played their cards right, they could have finally reasserted themselves and left United scrambling catch up.

Now you cannot escape the conclusion Liverpool are doing the scrambling. Going out of the Champions League on Tuesday night was a savage blow and my initial fear was that after waiting five years to return to that competition, it could be another few years before they get back in again.

United, on the other hand, look like they are resuming normal service. They need working on before they reach a title-winning level once more but they remain on their perch they claimed in May 2011. Liverpool have let them off the hook.

Win a trophy and Pardew’s turnaround is complete

The transformation in Alan Pardew’s fortunes at Newcastle is one of the stories of the season and he deserved to enjoy the Chelsea win. It shows what can happen when clubs persevere with managers, and victory at Arsenal tonight would propel them into the top five. Given the confidence he and his players have, Newcastle will believe they can get a result at the Emirates.

Realistically, though, how long will Newcastle stay there? Sooner or later, the clubs with better resources will elbow them away from the Champions League spots. If Newcastle finish seventh or eighth, it represents a good season. Pardew, however, has a chance to make it a memorable one. 

They have a quarter-final in the Capital One Cup at Tottenham on Wednesday and they will not want to squander that opportunity. Newcastle’s fans are desperate for silverware and, if Pardew can deliver, people would really sit up and take notice of the job he has done.

Football is all about winning trophies. Everyone praised Newcastle for finishing fifth in 2012 but supporters will never say: ‘Remember that year we qualified for the Europa League?’ They want to talk about famous days at Wembley and, for Newcastle, it has been too long coming.

Like Pardew, Sam Allardyce at West Ham has worked hard to turn things round. But if they want to change perceptions, a trophy would do that.

THIS WEEK I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO: Seeing Andy Carroll... go back to war 

I know from experience that when Andy Carroll is in the mood and he gets the right kind of service, he is unplayable. He is a nightmare for defenders to handle.

John O’Shea and Wes Brown, then, will be bracing themselves for what is headed in their direction this afternoon at the Stadium of Light. Carroll was outstanding in West Ham’s win over Swansea last week and he will want to build on it.

The corresponding game last season between Sunderland and West Ham was shown on Monday Night Football and Carroll absolutely tormented Brown and O’Shea.

Carroll knocked Brown over when scoring and O’Shea ended up being substituted.

Sunderland’s defenders had a straightforward afternoon at Anfield seven days ago when keeping a clean sheet but if Carroll is in the frame of mind he showed against Swansea, it will be anything but for Gus Poyet’s men.

It will make for interesting viewing.
