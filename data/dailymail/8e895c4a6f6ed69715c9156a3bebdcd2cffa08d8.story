Heartfelt message: Matt Bowers revealed the sheet terror he felt when he wrote the message to his parents on the back of his hand on Friday as the Arapahoe High School shooting was occurring

As gunshots rang out on Friday, terrified Arapahoe High School student Matt Bowers scribbled a desperate goodbye message to his family on the back of his hand - promising to see them again one day in heaven.

Bowers and his terrified fellow students had heard a loud series of bangs from outside their classroom but it was the announcement of a full and immediate lockdown over the school intercom that caused them to fear for their lives after 18-year-old Karl Pierson shot Claire Davis, 17, at point blank range.

But in the midst of the panic as Bowers and his class bolted to the corner of the classroom, he found a ball point pen and etched, 'Family, I love you all so much' - underlining the 'so much' - and underneath drew a cross with the words 'I am here now' to symbolize the afterlife.

Speaking to CNN, Bowers said that he truly believed that if the shooter, who was unknown to him at the time, had entered the class room, he thought he was going to die and wanted his family to know he was in a better place.

'That's where I really genuinely thought I was headed if Karl happened to stumble into our classroom and actually end it for all of us,' said Bowers to CNN.

The teen's teacher locked the door and whipped off the lights and as the classroom heard more shots, they also heard someone shouting threats at other students in the corridor.

They were ordered to the corner of the classroom as far as they could get away from the door.

His mind racing, Bowers prayed to God and then wrote his heart-wrenching message onto his hand.

'I found that I was carrying a pen with me, a ball point pen, and that morning, I didn't really tell my family I loved them,' said Bowers to CNN.

'I wrote, 'I love you' on my hand just so that they knew I was thinking about them, and I was praying for them.'

'Since the shooting, I have been carrying the pen in my pocket the whole time,' said Bowers.

In the aftermath of shooting in which Pierson eventually ended his own life, Bowers said that he and his classmates cowered for 30 minutes while they heard the cries of other students and law enforcement outside.

In his own blog post published on Saturday, Bowers declared, 'My entire life had changed in the course of 30 seconds.'

'Really it was just a normal day when it all started. The first loud bang we heard from the hallway, we didn't really quite know what it was,' Bowers told CNN.

'After spending about an hour in this classroom, we were finally escorted out of the building by the S.W.A.T. team, hands raised in the hair.'

Eventually Bowers and his classmates were taken to Shepherd of the Hills church where the frightened students waited for their terrified parents to pick them up.

'I have never had such a frightening experience in my life before like that,' said Bowers.

'It really changed how I looked at my life, and just my whole perspective on what life is.'
