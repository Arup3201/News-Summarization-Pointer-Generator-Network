A chestnut pony found on the brink of starvation after suffering years of cruelty is now healthy and looking for a new home.

Boyd was found emaciated and infested with lice, but rescuers have now transformed him into the picture of a healthy horse. 

He was rescued by the Blue Cross after he was found on a farm in South Wales in April 2011, with barely any hair remaining on his body and was nervous of almost all human contact.

He was riddled with worms and left to wander in a concrete yard with no food or shelter.

Vets feared the pony, aged 18 months, would not survive, but after three years of intensive rehabilitation, Boyd is almost unrecognisable. 

Kath Urwin, manager of the Blue Cross Rehoming Centre in Burton, Staffordshire, said: 'We have put in a lot of time to help Boyd gain confidence and become the healthy, happy horse he is today. 

'We are delighted that our efforts have developed him into a wonderful horse and hope to see him finally settled in a home of his own soon.

'We've seen many animals in extreme need but we'll never forget the day that 18-month-old Boyd came to Blue Cross. 

'He was underfed, weak and infested with lice. The terrified pony's muscles were severely wasted and he was riddled with worms.

'Boyd's condition was so critical that it was going to be a battle to keep him alive.

'He had been living in squalor, left to roam in a cement yard without any proper food, shelter or veterinary care.'

She explained the rescue team first treated Boyd's lice and worms before beginning a 'long, uphill process' of building up his strength and teaching him to trust again.

She added: 'After his traumatic past, it took him quite some time to adapt to life at the centre. 

'He didn't have much confidence, so his training progressed slowly, but surely. Then, towards the end of last year he had a real breakthrough and his training came on in leaps and bounds.

'Sadly, we often never get to find out what happens to the owners who let animals get into this state, because prosecutions are handled by the RSPCA - all we know is that his previous owners handed him over willingly to RSPCA inspectors.

'We had to be very patient with Boyd, gradually getting him used to being handled and led out and about by the team here at the centre. 

'He's a completely different pony to when he arrived all those months ago and he's progressed so well that he's now ready to be rehomed.'

Blue Cross helps over 40,000 sick, injured and unwanted pets every year.
