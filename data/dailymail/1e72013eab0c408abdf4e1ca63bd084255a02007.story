Cinetta Jackson (above) has been charged with statutory rape

A woman has been jailed after she was accused of having sex with a teenager.

Cinetta Jackson, 50, of Memphis, Tennessee, reportedly slept with the boy who is just 14-years-old while she was living at his family's home.

She was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with statutory rape by an authority figure. 

According to Fox 13, Jackson is being held on $50,000 bond and has declined to comment. 

She is expected to appear in court on Thursday morning.

Under Tennessee law, statutory rape by an authority figure states that the victim is between 14 and 18-years-old, the aggressor is at least four years older than the victim, and that they 'had, at the time of the offense, parental or custodial authority over the victim and used the authority to accomplish the sexual penetration. 

The charge means that should she be convicted, she would not be eligible for probation and forced to serve her full sentence.

It is not known at this time why Jackson was living in the boy's home or if there is any relation between her and the boy's parents.
