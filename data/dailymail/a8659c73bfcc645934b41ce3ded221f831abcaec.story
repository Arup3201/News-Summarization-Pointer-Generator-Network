A smash-up involving a Fiat 500 may be a common sight for people in Italy's capital city. 

But the care-free Italian attitude to driving is now set to be immortalised in the 24th James Bond film. 

Scenes from the movie - which will be released in November 2015 - will be set in Rome and feature a daring parachute descent by Daniel Craig on to the city's famous Ponte Sisto bridge.

Scenes from the 24th James Bond film will be shot in Rome for the first time - the opening sequence of Quantum of Solace featured a high-energy roof-top chase in Siena (pictured)

Siena and Tuscany - Quantum of Solace

Sardinia - The Spy Who Loved Me

Venice - From Russia With Love, Moonraker, Casino Royale 

True to form, the film will include a series of high-adrenaline car chases with some through Rome's narrow cobbled streets, which ends with one car flying in to the river Tiber. 

In another pursuit, the iconic Fiat 500 ends up being crushed on the approach to the Vatican.  

The Rome footage will be shot in February and March and cover three high-action scenes, sources have said. 

Other scenes will be shot south of Rome at the Royal Palace of Caserta, known as the Versailles of Italy, as well as in Serbia and at Pinewood studios in Surrey, according to Italian news agency ANSA.

This will mark the first time a Bond film has ever taken place in Italy's capital, although Siena and Venice have starred in previous movies.

The opening sequence of Quantum of Solace, released in 2008, featured a tile-shattering roof-top chase across Siena. 

Infamous Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld will make a return with Christoph Waltz expected to play him 

Elsewhere, it was revealed this week that infamous Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, his most feared adversary, will make a return. 

Django Unchained star Christoph Waltz is tipped to play the evil genius - famous for his trademark white cat and for gruesomely disposing of his failing underlings – in the new movie. 

The baddie made his last appearance in an ‘official’ Bond film in 1981 when he featured in For Your Eyes Only.

In a nail-biting opening scene Blofeld is hanging from an helicopter  piloted by Roger Moore’s James Bond.

The scene ends with Blofeld being dropped down a huge brick industrial chimney close to the River Thames in London.

Pre-production work on ‘Bond 24’ has already started in Austria, and Waltz’s co-stars will be Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as spymaster M and Ben Whishaw as Q.
