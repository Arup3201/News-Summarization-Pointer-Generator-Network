Justin Rose became the first 
Englishman to win golf's US Open since 1970 with victory at Merion yesterday.

Rose followed
in the footsteps of Tony Jacklin 43 years ago by dramatically winning the championship in Pennsylvania last night.

He also ended the long wait for a 
major winner since Sir Nick Faldo won the Masters championship
in 1996.

An emotional Rose paid tribute to his father as he spoke of his victory.

Rose scored 70 in his final round to finish one over par and condemn Phil Mickelson to his sixth runners-up finish in the event on his 43rd birthday, finishing two shots behind alongside Australian Jason Day.

Although he is the first Englishman to triumph since Tony Jacklin ten years before he was even born, Rose is the third European winner of the US Open in the last four years.

Fellow golfer Rory McIlroy was among the first to pay tribute to Rose's victory last night.

Ulsterman McIlroy, who bent a club in frustration during the contest, wrote on Twitter: 'So happy for @JustinRose99! Couldn't happen to a better lad!'

Golfer Graeme McDowell, also from Northern Ireland, added: 'Congratulations to @JustinRose99. Best player in the world the last few years. Major much deserved. #respect.'

Rose began the day two shots off the lead held by Mickelson but soon caught him.

But he was pushed all the way by his rivals in a dramatic finish.

As he sunk his winning putt, an emotional Rose looked to the heavens in tribute to his father Ken who introduced him to the sport, but died of leukemia in 2002.

He told reporters afterwards: 'You saw me look to the heavens with it being Father's Day - I was just trying to remember my dad.

'My coach Sean Foley sent me a text this morning which said "Go out there and be the man that your dad taught you to be and that your kids can look up to".'

Strong day: Rose tees off at the ninth on a day he showed both consistency and skill

Rose, who finished fourth in the Open as a 17-year-old amateur in 1998 andÂ  turned professional the next day, added: 'It feels fantastic, absolutely amazing.

'Going forward it gives me a lot of confidence.

'I don't know if it takes pressure off, but it's a moment where you can look back and think childhood dreams have come true.'

His previous best finish was joint third place in last year's Open which was won by Ulsterman Rory McIlroy.

The last Englishman to lift the US Open was Tony Jacklin, who won
by seven shots at Hazeltine, Minnesota, in 1970. Five other Englishmen 
won the US Open pre-war, while a host of Scotsmen won early editions of 
the event.

World number one Tiger Woods was well off the pace and his challenge was ended even before the final round.
