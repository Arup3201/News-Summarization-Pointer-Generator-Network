A barmaid who was tied up as masked men ransacked the golf club where she worked in a night-time raid was actually the girlfriend of one of the robbers and helped plan the attack, a trial heard.

Managers of the prestigious Pine Ridge Golf Club had nothing but sympathy for Samantha Mawtus, who said she had been put through the terrifying ordeal.

Mawtus, 27, was given a week off to recover from the break-in but police inquiries soon led back to the mother-of-two when her boyfriend was arrested with another man.

Police believe the barmaid helped plan the night raid with the pair. She has denied conspiracy to commit robbery at Guildford Crown Court.

However, she claims she was ‘deceived’ by her boyfriend Mitchell Laidlaw, 25, from Liverpool, and his accomplice Kieran Beatty, 23, from Maidstone, Kent who have both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob the club on March 20 last year.

But Nicola Merrick, prosecuting, 
said: ‘Miss Mawtus made an agreement or plan with the two men to commit 
robbery at the club that night.

‘She was often short of money.’

She
said on the evening of the robbery, the defendant had switched shifts 
with another staff member which meant that she was working at the club 
in Camberley, Surrey, on the crucial night.

Her supervisor Simon Price, was in charge of the bar and allowed the barmaid to have a cigarette outside, leaving him alone.

But just minutes later a stranger came in through the same door wearing a balaclava and wielding a baseball bat.

Nicole Merrick said: ‘At first, Mr Price thought it was a joke. But the man soon made it clear that it was anything but.’

Ms Merrick said the robber forced Mr Price to empty the till of £330 before forcing him to leave the building.

The
terrified barman was then dragged to a nearby wood, tied to tree and 
had his mouth taped to ensure he wouldn’t raise the alarm.

But 20 minutes later he was able 
to free himself and run back to the club where he found Mawtus on the 
phone making a 999 call.

The jury heard that the defendant claimed that she been grabbed from behind by a man and her hands and legs were bound.

The defendant said she had spent 30 minutes freeing herself before calling the police.

Mrs Merrick said that initially, the police assumed that Mawtus was a victim.

But as their enquiries continued and her boyfriend was arrested, they became suspicious of her.

A search of her Ford Fiesta, which 
had been unusually parked in the customer car park and not in the staff 
car park on the night of the raid, revealed a balaclava and a rubber 
glove.

Police also found a roll of gaffer tape of the type used to tie up Mr Price with Beatty’s finger-prints on it.

Jurors heard that Mawtus had made a phone call to Laidlaw a few minutes before the robbery had been committed.

‘During the time when she said she was lying tied up and terrified on the ground, she was in communication with one of the robbers.

‘She was helping her boyfriend and his accomplice commit what was a very nasty and frightening incident for Mr Price,’ said Ms Merrick.

Giving evidence, Mr Price told the court that on the evening that the raid happened, he had been expecting another member of staff to be working with him - not Mawtus.

‘She asked to go outside and have a cigarette in the designated no-smoking area,’ he said.

‘No more than five minutes elapsed before Miss Mawtus going out for a cigarette and the robber coming in.’

‘He was waving a bat in front of me. I thought it was a joke and told him to stop messing around.’

But he said that the raider told him ‘I’m not messing around, give me the money.’

Mr Price said it was only later that he realised it was significant that the intruder had never inquired who else was in the bar at the time.

The trial continues.
