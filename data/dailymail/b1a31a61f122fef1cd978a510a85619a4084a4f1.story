A 12-year-old thug who bashed a teenager around the head with an iron bar, causing permanent hearing damage, has been sentenced to just three months probation.

Jordan Biggs, 16, was cycling to a relative's home with a friend in Birmingham when they were confronted by a gang of youths, including the younger boy.

As they tried to cycle away, the 12-year old whacked Jordan on the back of the head with the bar, fracturing his skull.

Jordan collapsed minutes later and was rushed to hospital where doctors removed a potentially-deadly blood clot on his brain.

The attack has left the Birmingham teenager partially deaf in one ear.

But the 12-year-old attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received just a three-month referral order at the city's youth court after he admitted wounding - and was told to pay his victim just £100 compensation.

If the schoolboy completes the probation order, in future he will not have to disclose his criminal record as the conviction will be 'spent'.

Jordan's mother Sharon Heap has now contacted the Crown Prosecution Service to demand the case is referred to the Attorney General in a bid to increase the sentence.

She said: 'Police were stationed to remain at my son's hospital to begin with to wait to speak to the surgeon, as his condition was so serious it was not known if he would live.

'And his attacker gets a referral to a youth offending team. What message does it send out? What deterrent is it?

'The age of criminal responsibility is ten so why is a 12-year-old, who smashes a modified metal bar on to my son's skull in an unprovoked attack, just given a slap on the wrist?

'Jordan's life has changed forever, the impact has been devastating. I want to see the sentence reviewed and a sentence which fits the crime handed out.'

Jordan had been cycling to his aunt's house with a friend riding on the back of the bike when yobs targeted them in Stechford.

His mother said: 'Jordan was about to spend his last night in Birmingham before moving to Weston-super-Mare to be with me.

'He had been staying with my sister, his aunt, while he finished his exams.

'I went to Birmingham on the Saturday to stay overnight and was due to take him home with me the next day.

'He and his friend Luke had been cycling along Gillcroft Road, Stechford, and were very close to my sister's house when the attack happened.

'They saw three lads on the opposite side of the road. One shouted across: "Have you got a cigarette?" Luke called back, "No, sorry".

'The lads then crossed the road and one tried to pull Luke off the back of the bike.

'Jordan then saw something out of the corner of his eye. He thought it was perhaps a hammer, he just saw a glint of metal. He ducked his head and then felt something strike the back of his head.

'Jordan tried cycling faster to get away. He felt something running down the side of his head, put his hand up and saw blood on his hand.

'At that moment he jumped off the bike, told Luke to cycle to the house to get me and then Jordan himself started running up the road back home.

'He was in shock at that point. Meanwhile, myself and other relatives had been sitting down ready to watch the England game on that night, expecting Jordan and Luke to be back any minute to watch it.

'The next thing I know Luke comes in and behind him Jordan comes crashing through the door shouting "Mum" and collapses on the floor.

'I leapt up and ran outside, afraid someone may be coming in after him. When I get back in, my brother-in-law had got Jordan into a chair and was giving him first aid. Jordan was still bleeding a lot, was in shock and was shaking. It was horrendous.'

It was the start of a living nightmare for the loving mother.

Jordan was rushed by ambulance to Heartlands Hospital where a CT scan revealed the teenager had suffered a fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and a significant blood clot.

In the early hours of the following morning - the day he was meant to travelling to Weston-super-Mare with his mother- he was transferred to intensive care at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

He spent more than four hours in theatre undergoing brain surgery to have the clot removed. He remained in intensive care for three days and hospital for 11.

'The surgery was successful and medically he is okay now, although he has lost some of the hearing in one of his ears and requires is going to have to have a hearing aid fitted.

Jordan can no longer skateboard, dance, or do any other activities in which he could suffer another fall, as it would risk causing further damage to his head

'But psychologically, the impact of what happened has been devastating. He has had to give up so many things. He had previously worked in a kitchen and wanted to be a chef when he completed his exams.

'He was due to start an apprenticeship, but he did a few days and couldn't cope with the pace and noise after the attack.

'He was very active and loved street dancing.

'He raised money by street dancing for Cancer Research - his nan had died of cancer. But he has been told he can't do that or some of the activities he loved doing before because a fall might cause further damage and it's too risky.

'He can't do skateboarding, which he enjoyed. He gets angry now because he's frustrated he can't pursue the life and activities he had planned.

'He's moved to live with me now in Weston-super-Mare but it's not the life he had been looking forward to.'

Police arrested three juveniles after the attack earlier this summer. Two 14-year-olds were released without charge.

A 12-year-old was charged with wounding, and he appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Youth Court last week where he admitted the offence.

He was handed just a three-month referral order to the Youth Offending Team and was ordered to pay £100 compensation to Jordan.

Ms Heap said: 'The police said to me: "What can you do with a 12-year-old? Do you lock him up and perhaps set him on his way to a life of crime?"

'But I am absolutely disgusted at the sentence, especially considering everything Jordan has been through and is still going through.
