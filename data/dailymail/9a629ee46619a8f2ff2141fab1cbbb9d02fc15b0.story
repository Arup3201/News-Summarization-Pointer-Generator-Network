As Israel and Hamas crept nearer to the ignition of a regional war over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was riding a Pee-Wee Herman-style bicycle – a female model – near his home on the swanky island of Nantucket.

First President Obama's 'mom jeans,' and now this.

A Boston Herald columnist wrote Monday that 'Kerry – rarely camera-shy – couldn’t be found,' on Saturday and Sunday.

He was, apparently, out for a ride on a pink bike.

Everything but handlebar tassles: Kerry's feminine bicycle will likely be the subject of jokes for years to come

Kerry ditched his sandals and his cute ride or the U.S.-Africa Business Forum in Washington on Tuesday, but seemed less than pleased to be in the spotlight

Big adventure: Kerry's island ride had all the masculinity of a Pee-Wee Herman cameo -- without the horizontal bike crossbar

And as Gaza turned into the world's latest flashpoint, the Herald writer noted, the job of explaining the United States' position 'was left to President Obama himself and other White House officials.'

National Review Online, a conservative website, was first to point a mocking figure at the secretary of state, courtesy of a photograph posted on a Nantucket tourist Owen Perkins' Instagram feed.

Perkins told the publication that he took the photo early Sunday afternoon near Kerry's home in Nantucket's swanky Brant Point neighborhood.

Conservatives will make hay over the photo, of course, which looks more like President Barack Obama in his 'mom jeans' than Vladimir Putin and his bear-wrestling.

The Kremlin has spared no effort in the past to cast the White House as weak and feminine.

After Obama announced a new round of sanctions on Russia last week, in response to Moscow's continued encroachment in the Ukraine, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted a split-screen photo of Putin and Obama side-by-side.

In the image, the Russian leader is posed with a leopard and the U.S. president is holding a poodle.

Kerry's thrill ride as the Middle East burns isn't his first bid to get out of Dodge for some rest and relaxation during a global crisis.

Second time around: Kerry was spotted sailing last year on a Wednesday as Egypt saw its president overthrown by Islamist radicals

Worse than 'mom jeans'? Maybe.

In 2014 as Egypt's political tumult led to the overthrow of then-president Mohamed Morsi, the State Department insisted that the secretary was 'working all day and on the phone dealing with the crisis.'

But CBS News obtained a picture of him on his sailboat in Nantucket sound on a Wednesday as regime change approached in Cairo.

A quick about-face followed, with Kerry spokeswoman Jen Psaki conceding he was 'briefly on his boat' before returning to the salt mines of international diplomacy.

'Secretary Kerry worked around the clock all day,' she insisted, water sports notwithstanding, 'including participating in the President's meeting with his national security council.'

Russia's deputy prime minister tweeted a picture last week mocking Barack Obama's masculinity just days after the U.S. president announced a fresh wave of sanctions against the country
