James McCarthy says Everton's players are getting primed for a silverware push with Roberto Martinez's tough pre season training regime.

The Republic of Ireland midfielder and his team mates who did not play at the World Cup are working in intense conditions out in Austria as the Everton manager pushes his players to go one better than last season.

The Toffees narrowly missed out on a top four place that would have granted them Champions League qualification - and McCarthy says that they now want to win something, with Martinez's training camp getting them ready for a long season ahead.

'The sessions are difficult, most of the work is with the ball and now and again there's a few runs but it's enjoyable and as a squad we're enjoying it so far.
