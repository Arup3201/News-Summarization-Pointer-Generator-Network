A baby who was beating a cancer-like illness, died unexpectedly and suddenly after contracting a deadly infection.

When he was just five months old Max Moment was diagnosed with Langerhans Cell 
Histiocytosis - a rare blood cell disease which affects around 50 children a 
year and leads to painful sores all over the body.

It began as a red dotted 
rash and he was referred to a dermatologist. The condition had affected his liver and spleen.

Rare disease: Max Moment had Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis which affects around 50 children a year

After
 11 months of chemotherapy, Max went into remission
 and his mother Mikayla MacMillan, 27, began to plan their future together.

Around the same time he contracted chickenpox after his elder sister Olivia, five, picked it up but Max was said to have been treated appropriately and treatment was successful.

Tragedy then struck just two weeks later after he was seen by doctors at Manchester Children Hospital for chemotherapy.

The 
following day he appeared floppy and unwell and Miss MacMillan dialled 999.

He was rushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital by 
ambulance and was said to have been suffering from fever in keeping with
 septic shock.

He underwent
 treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator 
before his condition deteriorated - he died on April 15.

Dr Vanessa Holme told the inquest that Max underwent treatment during resuscitation and was stabilised on a ventilator before his condition deteriorated.

Giving her opinion on his death she said: 'My opinion is that Max succumbed to an overwhelming infection.'

After an inquest into Max’s death Mrs MacMillan, of Clitheroe, Lancashire, said: 'What happened to Max was the cruellest blow as he appeared better and happier than he had ever been in his whole life.

'He had been absolutely fine the day before his death and had gone to sleep with a smile on his face.

'A couple of days before that he had started to learn to crawl and we were planning holidays because before that we couldn’t take anything for granted. I wasn’t even able to cuddle him.

'Life was getting back to normal and we were able to play with him and we could take him out - not to the park because it was a bit too risky - but we went to the shops.

'The disease had more or less gone and we thought it was the end of it.

'It was the light at the end of the tunnel. He always had a good prognosis. Everything was always really positive and he was always really positive.

'What happened to him seems so cruel especially when he seemed to be so much better.'

Heart-breaking: Max was beating the rare disease when he caught chicken pox, which led to a fatal infection

As soon as Max was diagnosed doctors put him on chemotherapy, which was intensified at Christmas

Tests could not prove if Max had a viral infection or if was linked to his chicken pox but he had a lower than usual immune system.

Speaking outside the inquest Mrs MacMillan said: 'As soon as Max got the diagnosis in April 2013, the doctors put him on low dose chemotherapy until Christmas when they changed it to intense for three months.

'He was on chemotherapy all over Christmas and at one stage was really poorly and lost his hair.'

'He never got to go to a park because of the risk of infection and germs, even if one of the family had a cold we had to keep them away. We may as have well have put a cross on the door - he was that susceptible. A cold could wipe him out.

'He was in pain and it was heart-wrenching that you couldn’t cuddle him because that’s all you wanted to do.

'When he started the chemo his skin got better and you could give him cuddles almost straight away.

Max's mother Mikayla was unable to cuddle him due to painful sores which blistered and covered tiny body

'But you would not believe what he went through and I don’t know of many grown-ups who have been through as much as he had been through in 17 months.

'My Max was always smiling. There’s pictures of him in hospital with oxygen up his body and tubes and attached to a blood transfusion and laughing. He had 63 blood transfusions.

'The nurses used to laugh because instead of having a toy in his hand he would have a plastic syringe.

'That morning I didn’t realise how 
ill he was because death had never been an option for Max. I phoned 999 
and they said they had to put sirens on and in my heart of hearts I 
knew.

'His body had gone 
into shock. This was Tuesday morning. He had chemotherapy at Manchester 
on the Monday and he was laughing with doctors and it was normal and 
then the following day he was ill and died.'

Always smiling: Max's mother devastated Mikayla said her son was an inspiration during his short life

'We’re just so devastated. Whatever life threw at him, Max seemed to fight on and was an inspiration.

'He was a very happy child who always had a smile on his face. We explained to Olivia that he had gone to heaven and he was poorly.

'She writes letters to him in heaven and posted them to him and has a memory box of him so she can look at him whenever she wants.'

Recording a narrative conclusion, the coroner Mr Michael Singleton said that Max had 'succumbed to an overwhelming infection' and because of his ongoing maintenance chemotherapy his immune system had been low. He said he still may have died even if he wasn’t on chemotherapy.

Mr Singleton told Mrs MacMillan: 'I know there are no words I can express that will take away any of the pain.

'I can’t begin to imagine what that must be like, I know coming here must not have been easy.'
