Killed: Jo La Spina was found dead at her home in Bingil Bay

The tiny township of Bingil Bay in Queensland’s north has been rocked by the suspicious death of a woman, 26, inside her two storey townhouse.

Jo La Spina, 26, was sleeping inside her Bingil Bay Rd unit when police allege she was attacked sometime during the early hours of April 19.

She was last seen leaving the Bingil Bay Café at about 2.30am, with a man who is believed to be known to her.

Detective Acting Inspector Kevin Goan said the man attempted to escort Ms La Spina from the café dance floor about 2.30am.

'We believe that they may have been at the Bingil Bay Café up until 2.30am on the Saturday morning,' Acting Insp. Goan said.

Her body was found later that day by another occupant of the house after he returned home from work.

The pair are also believed to have worked together.

Working on information from the public, police yesterday made a breakthrough arrest following more than a week of investigations.

Musa Brandon Ngwira, 31, from South Mission Beach was arrested at Cronulla and refused bail yesterday at Sutherland Local Court.

He will be extradited back to Queensland to appear before the Cairns Magistrates Court on April 30.

Detective Acting Insp. Goan said Ms La Spina, a well-respected woman who worked in Bingil Bay’s profitable tourism industry, was the target of a cruel 'act of violence.'

He said her family is 'simply devastated.'

'This was the needless taking of a young person’s life that is simply hard for the family to come to terms with and certainly for the community of Bingil Bay-Mission Beach to come to terms with,' he said.

'It is something that will scar the hearts of the family for many years and the community in general.'

He called the attack 'opportunistic,' and said the timing of it would have coincided with when she was at her most vulnerable.

'The victim would have thought she was alone and safe at these premises,” he said.

'Our information is she slept alone and had the room to herself.'

Devastated: Ms La Spina's parents, family and friends are utterly distraught at her death which occurred in the early hours of Saturday April 19

Ms La Spina went to Blackheath and Thornburgh College in Charters Towers for high school, before graduating in 2005.

She then lived in Cairns and Townsville before coming back to Feluga, where her family live, to work as a photographer for rafting company Raging Thunder.

'She was a likable, bubbly, friendly girl,' Acting Insp. Goan said. 'Every witness we’ve spoken to has said this.'

Her mother Shelley penned a heartfelt note to her daughter which read:

'To my beautiful Jo, I love and miss you so very much.'

'Jo please remember how much you are loved. I will love and cherish you forever. Oh my sweet, sweet, beautiful baby.'

'We will love you for ever and ever and then more,

Mum'
