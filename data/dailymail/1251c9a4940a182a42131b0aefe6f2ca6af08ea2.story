A former Oregon vintner has been fined $250 for partaking in oral sex in front of other passengers on a commercial flight to Las Vegas in June, just days after he hosted TV chef Gordon Ramsay at his winery.

Chris Martin and the object of his affections, Medford hairdresser Jessica Stroble, each pleaded guilty in absentia in the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas to a federal misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct on Wednesday.

In a statement, Martin, 44, who was fired in August by his father whom he previously ran Troon Vineyards with, claimed the lewd act, which made international headlines, was the greatest mistake of his life.

'I have made many mistakes in my life, none greater than this one,' he told the Mail Tribune in a written statement. 'I have lost my job, my reputation and damaged the legacy I had worked 10 years to nurture and grow. I will learn from this and move on to the next chapter in my life.'

The pair were initially charged with a federal misdemeanor crime of lewd, indecent and obscene acts on an airplane.

That charge carried a maximum sentence of up to 90 days in jail and a $500 fine.

Martin complained that he had been persecuted by the press, claiming the media had done 'everything to paint me in nothing but the worst possible light.'

He said in the statement that he believes he would have been exonerated if his case had gone to trial but he pleaded guilty to move on with his life.

He also apologized for hurting his friends, family, Troon staff and other passengers.

'My actions were clearly inappropriate and inconsiderate,' Martin wrote. 'Seeing and hearing the level of venom directed at these people has been hardest for me and I am truly sorry for that.'

On the winery's Facebook page, Martin can be seen chatting and posing with Ramsay as the pair enjoy a meal together and taste the vineyard's produce.

It was reported in August that Martin had been forced to take a leave of absence by his father after the embarrassing sky-high performance.

Troon Vineyards announced on its Facebook page that Martin had been replaced pending the court case against him.

Martin and Stroble, 33, were arrested on June 21 after getting off an Allegiant Airlines flight from Medford, Oregon to Las Vegas, where they were attending a conference.

They engaged in a number of sex acts several different times on the plane while young families were on board.

Troon Vineyards: Martin's father Larry Martin wrote in August: 'Former Director of Troon Vineyard Chris Martin has taken an indefinite leave of absence following a complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court'

One horrified mother complained to staff: 'This is not the sex education I wanted to give my teenage sons.'

The announcement, which was signed by Chris' father Larry Martin said: 'Former Director of Troon Vineyard Chris Martin has taken an indefinite leave of absence following a complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court.'

Passengers, including children, looked on in horror as the beauty salon worker allegedly grew increasingly intimate with the exposed Martin before performing oral sex on him shortly after takeoff.

Court papers describe in graphic detail how they then engaged in a second sex act mid-way through the 90-minute flight and did not even reign in their passionate 
exchange when confronted by airline staff.

They did take a break, however, when the mid-flight drink and snack service came down the aisle, but resumed shortly after.

This time it was Stroble who exposed herself as the tryst became even more heated. At one point, according to another passenger, Martin appeared to be 'in his own world' as passions grew.

Martin's attorney, Larry C. Hill, 
said passengers on the plane exaggerated events and because there was a person in the aisle seat no one would have been able to have a full view of what was taking place.

'Mr Martin is prejudicially 
characterized by the media as a reckless individual, which is contrary 
to his long-standing ties and contributions to the southern Oregon 
community,' he told Fox5.

'He's already being deemed guilty by the media. There are customers canceling contracts with him. There's orders that are not being renewed.'

When
approached by The Smoking Gun in August at the beauty salon where she works, 
Stroble claimed she had no idea about the court action.

And when asked to comment on the specific allegations, she replied: 'None of that happened.'

She
also refused to expand on the nature of her relationship with Martin 
other than to confirm that they are not married and that she had no 
contact information for him.

On Troon's Facebook page, customers have been divided on whether or not to stick with the company.

Leah Jolma wrote: 'Why does one have 
to have anything else to do with the other? Chris may or may not have 
done something. So what?

'Troon wine is delicious. If you need to pass judgement on him so be it. That is just more great wine for me. Thanks.'

Ian Shelley said: 'I'm pretty sure that I'm 
actually going to buy more Troon wine because of this incident. I'm a 
big proponent of sometimes doing things you shouldn't.'

Liam Soslowe did not agree and 
posted: 'Come on community, take a stand, there are TONS of other local 
& incredible wineries, that know how to be professional, take your 
business somewhere else till they clean this mess up!'

Kristina Smith Stader said: 'The 
problem I have is the fact that he is not an employee , he is the owner 
of the company. So any dollar I spend there adds to his profits.

'He has a
true lack of respect and consideration for others.  If I knew he would 
not profit at all from the business any longer than I would reconsider 
doing business there.'

Others took the situation lightly 
with one guy posting: 'Can I order a bottle of whatever Jessica was 
drinking for my girlfriend??'
