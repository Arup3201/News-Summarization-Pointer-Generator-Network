The owner of two seven-week-old terrier puppies who dumped them in a shoe box outside a cold doorway has been branded "cowardly" by the RSPCA today.

A black bitch and a tan and black puppy were found in a men's Timberland shoe box after the owner abandoned them on the doorstep of a stranger before knocking on the door and leaving the scene

Both puppies had hair loss and a skin condition which is thought to be mange.

The black puppy also had discharge coming from her eyes.

The member of the public cared for the puppies at her home in Beggarswood, Basingstoke, Hampshire, from 9pm on January 8.

They were collected the next day by RSPCA inspector Jan Edwards, who took them to a local vet for treatment.

Inspector Edwards said: 'Abandoning animals is cowardly and totally unacceptable and I would urge anyone with information about the person involved to please come forward.

'Luckily, these puppies were found quickly so they were still fairly warm but they were quiet and no doubt stressed by their ordeal.

'Where they were left is on a street which is close to a parade of shops and a car park so we are hoping someone may have seen the person responsible, even if they were not aware at the time what the shoe box contained.

'I would urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward so we can ensure no other animal is in danger or in need of treatment.'

Anyone found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal faces up to six months in prison and a Â£20,000 pounds fine under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
