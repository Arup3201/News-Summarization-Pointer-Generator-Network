An Elvis impersonator who sang for Elton John posed as a 13-year-old girl to trade explicit pictures with other internet perverts.

Louis Fella, 53, was jailed for a year after being caught with more than 900 indecent pictures and films of children. Some of them were in the most serious category of child abuse images. 

Fella rubbed shoulders with Sir Elton John at his famous charity White Tie & Tiara Summer Ball and has also played in front of Liam Gallagher, Tom Jones, Lulu and Shirley Bassey at Brit Award after-show parties.

Louis Fella, pictured, impersonated a 13-year-old girl while talking online to fellow paedophiles 

The father-of-two has travelled around the world with his act under the stage name Louis Rockafella.

In 2002, record company Sony BMG snapped him up to promote the release of Elvis’s No. 1s album.

He also appeared on US talk show The Jerry Springer Show in Chicago and with other Elvises on the Weakest Link.

But the entertainer, who described himself as the UK’s best Elvis impersonator, was condemned by a judge over his internet habits. 

Judge Andrew Hatton said: 'A significant number of young children experienced abuse and vile degradation in order that you could obtain sexual gratification.

'You were continuing that abuse and suffering by those children by distributing those images to others with a similar wish.'

Fella, pictured, was found to have more than 900 indecent images, many of them of the most serious type 

Liverpool Crown Court heard police became aware of Fella after the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children flagged up indecent images uploaded to an internet storage facility.

They executed a warrant at his home in Birkdale, Southport, last April and seized computers from his home and business, the Sun Recording Studio, named after the Memphis studio used by Elvis.

On the computers and an SD card were 917 indecent images and four movies.

Further analysis revealed that Fella had shared some of the files to other perverts on the internet.

In interview, Fella admitted posing online as a 13-year-old girl called Becky to engage in sexual chats with men but denied distributing the images.

But he last month admitted 19 counts of possessing and distributing indecent images.

Fella, circled, appeared on a special charity of The Weakest Link with Anne Robinson for charity 

David Morton, defending Fella, told the court: 'He engaged in a largely private and deviant fantasy world in which he did not truly understand the seriousness of his behaviour.

'He has expressed instructions that when indulging in this he was suffering from self-loathing and revulsion and on occasion beat it to a point, only to be drawn back in to it.

'He has expressed great regret.'

The court heard how his relationship had broken up following the child porn revelations.

Judge Hatton, who viewed the images, said he had no option but to impose an immediate custodial sentence.

He told Fella, who had shorn off his Elvis-style sideburns ahead of the court appearance: 'It is very easy in these cases for lawyers and judges to make reference to scales, numbers and letters without anyone realising the material that we are dealing with.'

He condemned one picture which showed a six-year-old girl being abused.

'A six-year-old girl suffered that abuse and degradation so people like you can sit at your computer and look at it and distribute it to others with similar inclinations.'

Fella started performing as Elvis following a 12-year stint in the Army. 

Last month, when the Liverpool Echo exposed Fella’s sex crimes a close friend said he was left 'numb' by the revelations.

He said: 'He is a cracking laugh - he is the last person I could think of that would do something like this. It’s despicable.'

Fella was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years and put on put on the sex offender register. 

Fella, pictured, even played in front of thousands of Elvis fans in Las Vegas during an American tour 

He admitted 11 charges of downloading indecent images, seven of distributing some of them and one of possessing a total of 907 images between November, 2009, and April 8, 2013.

Simon Duncan, prosecuting, told the court today that police received intelligence that someone using the name Beckyfella had uploaded indecent images of children to 'cloud storage' in April 2012.

Officers attended his home with a search warrant and seized his laptop computer and SD card and they also went to the Southport recording studio he used and seized his Apple computer. 

Examination revealed that all three devices contained indecent images of children.

'There was evidence of distribution in conjunction with sexualised on line chats with individuals through Skype and email,' said Mr Duncan.

The defendant portrayed himself as a 13-year-old girl and used a picture of a girl about that age wearing a skirt.

Forensic analysis revealed a total of 917 images and four movies with 179 images in the most serious category involving penetrative sex. The 19 images he had distributed included some in the top category and all had come from 'his stock of pictures,' he said.

When first interviewed he admitted searching the internet for dating site and pornography and admitted pretending to be a young girl but denied seeking child porn or distribution.

Re-interviewed in March this year after the material had been analysed he admitted distribution but denied obtaining sexual gratification.

The court heard that he has previous old convictions, including fraud, but had never been jailed.

Mr Morton, defending, said that Fella, who showed no emotion during the hearing, has lost his relationship and contact with his daughter on whom 'he utterly doted' because of his offending.

He said the judge had the stark choice between jailing him or allowing the embryonic work that he had begun with the probation service to reduce his risk to society.
