A new report commissioned by the U.S. speedskating team has catalogued a series of mistakes that contributed to the team's worst performance in 30 years at this winter's Sochi Olympics.

Among the errors were the late introduction of suits made by Under Armour as well as having the team train at high altitude and outdoors in Italy prior to the games, which took place indoors and at sea level.

The findings show that the conditions in Italy masked a drop in form by the athletes.

A new report cites late introduction of new uniforms and poorly planned altitude training as factors in the U.S. speedskating team's worst Olympic performance in decades

The report, detailed in a story by the Wall Street Journal, reflects a team becoming progressively more and more frustrated as athletes failed to excel.

The Under Armour suits, given to the team only shortly before the race, should likely have been replaced with new Mach 39 suits as well as a skate polish introduced just before competition.

'The idea that we 
would give these game-changers to our athletes right before the Olympics
 and they would get to the line and feel like they had an advantage, 
that did not work,' said Ted Mr. Morris, executive director of U.S. Speedskating.

'The lesson there is that if we 
have game-changers like that, let's introduce them in December, not 
February.'

The review also noted that there was a failure to analyze performance data prior to the Sochi Olympics that would have easily predicted the team would not peak

Baltimore-based Under Armour declined requests to comment on the report. 

The company has renewed their partnership with the U.S. through the 2022 winter games.

Other issues included a demanding traveling schedule and a lack of collecting and analyzing data that could have predicted the team would not peak in Sochi.

'When 
you go back and look at those performance trends, our expectations going
 into Sochi were not realistic,' Mr. Morris said. 'The idea that we were
 going to go there and win eight, 10, 12 medals in long-track alone was 
way off.'

The team has since parted with director Finn Halvorsen, who was a major supporter of altitude training as well as guiding the team in the run up to the Olympics.

The report is not unlike USA Track & Field's review of the U.S. men's and women's relay team performance in the 2008 summer games, which cited 'excessive travel and poor 
long-term planning on the part of athletes, their coaches and agents"

That report's recommendations helped the team score 29 medals in London in 2012. 

The speedskating organization was somewhat reticent to undergo such a review.

'There was a little bit of a 
reaction of, 'you know, Â‘I don't want to relive it. I want to put it my 
rearview mirror. You guys figure it out,'' Morris said.
