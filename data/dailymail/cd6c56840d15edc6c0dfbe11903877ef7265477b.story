Boris Johnson today launched a passionate – if not entirely complimentary – defence of Nick Clegg as the Deputy Prime Minister was again forced to defend his leadership.

Mr Johnson, the Tory London Mayor, set out 20 reasons why everyone, and not just Conservatives, should be grateful that Mr Clegg ‘laid down his political life’ to form a government, even if that meant being attacked from all sides and suffering a ‘protracted political humiliation’.

Murmurings about his leadership and dreadful poll ratings, Mr Clegg will be grateful of praise coming from any quarter.

Boris Johnson said Nick Clegg is 'probably a natural Tory' as he set out why the Lib Dem must survive as leader

‘It is time for us Clegg fans to echo those kindly folk who are trying to save the sweet furry badgers from the wrath of farmers,’ Mr Johnson said.

‘Never mind the badgers – save the Cleggster from extermination!’

But the support of one of the 
country’s best known Conservatives will not be universally welcomed by 
Lib Dem activists. At one point Mr Johnson says Mr Clegg ‘probably a 
natural Tory’ aside from his views on Europe.

And
in a backhanded compliment he delights in the ‘utterly hopeless’ Lib 
Dem campaigns for a new voting system and an elected House of Lords 
which helped preserve the status quo.

Opinion polls carried out to make the start of this week’s Lib Dem conference made grim reading for Mr Clegg.

Boris Johnson compared Nick Clegg's plight to the government's looming badger cull: ¿Never mind the badgers ¿ save the Cleggster from extermination!¿

In one his net satisfaction ratings had dropped to -63, a new low. In a survey of party members for the LibDemVoice website, his approval rating had dropped into negative territory for the first time, down to minus two points.

Four in five Lib Dem members also fear being in coalition will be bad for the party's election prospects in 2015.

But Mr Johnson insist that without Mr Clegg’s bold decision to form a coalition, Gordon Brown would still be in power, and George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove would not have been able to embark on major economic, welfare and education reforms.

He also hails Mr Clegg as ‘a very nice chap indeed’ who is ‘very good at tennis’, though keeps losing to David Cameron.

‘His wife, Miriam González Durántez, is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears,’ Mr Johnson wrote in The Daily Telegraph.

‘I have always thought that if you leave out Europe, he is probably a natural Tory.

‘He is certainly tough, and can take a joke.’

Whether Mr Clegg can see the funny side to being lauded by Mr Johnson remains to be seen.
