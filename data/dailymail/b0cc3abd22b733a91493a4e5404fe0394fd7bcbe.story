The FTSE closed down 56 points this afternoon as a warning from the IMF on the UK economy added to doubts over the global economic recovery.

Relief overnight that the U.S. Congress had voted to raise its debt ceiling soon dissipated after poor manufacturing data from the U.S., Europe and China overnight reminded traders of the fragility of the world economy.

The warnings transferred to the Stock Exchange, which closed down 56.04 points at 5718.4, its lowest figure since the end of June.

The index had fallen across the day with a fall of 42 points coming following the International Monetary Fund's warning that Britain will have a 'bumpy and uneven recovery'.

Today's fall followed an overall drop of 40 points yesterday, when early euphoria about the U.S deal quickly fizzled out as the scale of cutbacks sank in, coupled with worry about the depth of political disagreements in the USA.

Backlash: Obama has faced criticism over his last-minute deal to save America from a debt default

But British gloom about slow growth 
was intensified by an International Monetary Fund report that predicted 
families would be an average £1,500 worse off for the next five years 
because of higher taxes and lower benefits imposed by the Government’s 
deficit-reduction programme.

However, Chancellor George Osborne 
received a boost as UK gilt prices fell to a record low, seen as a vote 
of confidence in Britain’s financial stability.

Debate continues to rage in America after lawmakers passed an 
11th-hour bill to raise the U.S. lending limit and avoid a 
calamitous debt default, but Barack Obama still faces an angry backlash.

Despite successfully passing the 
rescue package, the President must now deal with criticism from both 
sides of the aisle over the uneasy compromises that were made to pass 
the legislation.

The 
269-161 vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives drew a
line under the crisis with hours left before the U.S. ran out of cash 
to pay its bills.

Announcement: President Barack Obama arrives to speak from the White House briefing room about a deal being reached to raise the debt limit

Both Republicans and Democrats saw the bill as an unpalatable necessity and were only able to reach acceptable terms after weeks of bickering and brinkmanship.

It will not be official until the Democrat majority in the U.S. Senate rubber stamps the deal this afternoon and it is signed into law by President Obama.

But, coming after weeks of uncertaintly, the deal allays fears that another delay would leave the U.S. government facing an unprecedented default.

The drama was heightened last night by the return of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords to Congress for the first time since being shot in Tucson in January to cast her vote, to a resounding round of cheers.

But even as leaders from both parties scrambled to get enough votes to pass the deal on Capitol Hill, new storm clouds were gathering over the ailing U.S. economy.

More bad economic news and finger-pointing in Washington quickly overshadowed early optimism on Wall Street over the debt deal – with fears persisting that America will still see its credit rating downgraded this week.

Hopeful: U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip Jon Kyl walk to the Senate ahead of yesterday's, as a deal on the debt crisis becomes 'very close'

Early gains in the Dow Jones Index were quickly lost as official figures showed virtually zero manufacturing growth in the U.S..

The FTSE 100 Index was also  typical of stock markets worldwide in rising in early trading before closing at a loss by the day’s end.

The President and Democrats in Congress were forced into an uneasy compromise with their Republican opponents to forestall the crisis.

This led to Mr Obama being accused of selling out his principles to boost his re-election chances in next year’s presidential race.

Plunge: The FTSE rallied briefly yesterday morning but then went off a cliff after the release of U.S. manufacturing figures this afternoon

The deal thrashed out between party leaders will see America’s legal ‘debt ceiling’ rise by up to £1.46trillion – from the £8.71trillion limit it formally reaches today – which will take the country beyond the election and into 2013.

But this rise in borrowing will have to be matched by deep spending cuts over the next decade, which are likely to affect welfare programmes and medical care for the poor.

Crucially, the Democrats have also failed to secure any tax rises as part of the deal. President Obama said yesterday: ‘This has been a long and messy process. As with any compromise, the outcome is far from satisfying.’

He added: ‘Is this the deal I would have preferred? No.’

Democrat Congressman Emanuel Cleaver was more damning about the President’s capitulation to Republican demands, describing the plan as a ‘sugar-coated Satan sandwich’. 

At last: President Barack Obama's deal to raise the U.S. the debt ceiling gave a brief boost to the UK stock market before an afternoon plunge

The President admitted the deal cuts domestic spending to percentage levels not seen in more than half a century, but said his biggest priority was to avert the global economic chaos that could have followed a default.

Conservative lawmakers, meanwhile, toasted a major defeat for the administration.

House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the chief Republican negotiator, said: ‘The White House bid to raise taxes has been shut down.’

The only solace for the President appeared to be that he point blank refused to accept a short-term solution and has put off another polarising and acrimonious debate on the debt ceiling until after next November’s election day. The rancour raised concerns over whether the debt deal would be pushed through in time.

The bill had to be passed by  lawmakers in both houses of Congress before Mr Obama could sign it into law.

The Democrat-controlled Senate was expected to be relatively straightforward, but first, Republican leaders in the House of Representatives had to overcome a Tea Party rebellion to cobble together enough votes to keep the deal alive.

By passing the plan, the U.S. would beat the midnight deadline to avoid an unprecedented default on payments to investors in Treasury bonds and businesses that do work for the government.
