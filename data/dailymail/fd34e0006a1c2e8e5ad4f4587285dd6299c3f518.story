She may have just been announced as the face of high-end label Balmain, but Rihanna proves that even A-listers love a bit of bargain High Street.

The 25-year-old was spotted in New York 
over the weekend rocking a pair of £7 tracksuit bottoms from F&F at Tesco.

The grey marl joggers come with a 'comfortable ribbed waistband' and drawstring ties and the singer wore them with pale grey trainers, a warm black coat and an emerald green gillet.

Did you get any clubcard points? Rihanna stepped out in New York wearing a pair of £7 leggings from...Tesco!

'Ideal for lounging at home, sport or lazy days, they also have stylish ankle cuffs,' say F&F in a description of the trousers.

Clearly keen to emulate the style icon's cut-price urban look, shoppers flocked to the website to snap up a pair - and they've sold out save for one size 16 pair.

She even got them on sale! A source in the US confirmed that Rihanna's joggers were bought online at Tescoclothing.com

'They're only available at F-F.com and we've had confirmation from sources in the US,' a spokesman for F&F told The Telegraph.

'The brand are in contact with her style team but this seems to be a very organic purchase from Rihanna/her team as it came as a complete surprise,' they added when questioned about the unlikely nature of her recent purchase.

Her usual look: Rihanna was unveiled as the new face of Balmain this week and rocked the brand's high-end garments in the new campaign - a far cry from her Tesco gear
