Chris Noble was remembered at a packed service today in his home town in country NSW

A man who died when a convenience store exploded, destroying his unit block above, texted his mother 'I love you' around the exact time the blast went off.

At 4.08am on Thursday September 4, 27-year-old Chris Noble reached for his phone at his Rozelle unit in Sydney and sent a  final message to Liz Noble.

Speaking at a packed memorial service for her son at Canowindra, in central west NSW, his emotional mother read the contents of his final text message  which stated that he loved her.

'The last thing he (Chris) ever did was send a message at eight minutes past four on the morning of Thursday September 4 saying "I love you."

A timeline of events suggest the message was sent minutes after the building caught fire at 4.05am - and just 25 minutes before both the convenience store and unit block were reduced to rubble when it collapsed.

The refrigeration mechanic was one of three who died in the  fire, including a mother and her one-year-old son.

Chris' father Ross Noble said his son would leave an everlasting 'legacy' on the people he knew

Police are still determining the cause of the blaze which one officer said was 'the worst he'd seen' and have not ruled out the likelihood it was deliberately started.

Leichhardt Local Area Command Inspector Gary Coffey said the 'very traumatic incident' had taken an emotional toll on his officers.

'This is certainly the worst tragedy that I've had to deal with,' he said.

'It's a very difficult time for the police, particularly for the young police involved in this matter.' 

Speaking at the country NSW service in front of 1000 people Chris' father Ross Noble said his son would leave an everlasting 'legacy' on the people he knew.

He said he loved living in Sydney and was excited by the opportunities big city life offered him. 

He said the 27-year-old - who had a passion for both rugby union and American Football - enjoyed living near the central business district because it was 'close to the action.' 

Mourners gathered and wept for the well-liked 27-year-old refrigeration mechanic

Chris may have sent his final text to his mother while trying to escape the crumbling building

'He would have been chuffed about the fuss being made about him today and all the messages we've received and the number of people here has given the family strength.'

'We will miss Chris so much but he has a legacy that forever will be entrenched in our hearts and minds.'  

Mr Noble frequently travelled from Sydney to Canowindra and would play for the local Rugby Union Club, the Canowindra Pythons, three games a season.

A shaken friend and coach of his rugby team earlier delivered a statement paying tribute to the 27-year-old.  

'He just loved his mates in Canowindra and he just wanted to come back and play with them,' Graham Rice said. 

The Rozelle fire in Sydney's inner west killed three people including a one-year-old baby

Roommates of Chris Noble  told of how they escaped the fiery inferno and when they last heard the voice of the 27-year-old.

Todd Fisher and Corey Cameron were the two men who leapt from the second storey balcony of a Darling Street apartment, which was above a convenience store.

'It was just a huge bang, you wake up and the ceiling is already gone,' Mr Cameron told The Saturday Telegraph.

'It was like a movie, the floors were falling in behind us, the walls were caving in, the roof was gone, smoke everywhere.

'I could just hear Chris say 'I'm coming, I'm coming.' 

The pair said they had tried to re-enter the building when they heard their friend's voice but could not see past the flames.
