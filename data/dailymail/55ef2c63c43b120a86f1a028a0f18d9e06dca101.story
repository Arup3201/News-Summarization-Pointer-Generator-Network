If you want to know the secret to staying happily married for 80 years, don’t ask Maurice Kaye – just go straight to his wife, Helen.

Because apparently, 102-year-old Mr Kaye will simply agree with whatever she says anyway.

And that, he believes, is the key to their success.

Maurice Kaye, left, met his wife Helen, right, when he would visit the London shop where she worked in 1929 

Mr Kaye was a travelling salesman just aged 17 in Walworth, South London when he first met 16-year-old Helen

‘The most useful thing is that as long as I agree with her, then I’m safe,’ said Mr Kaye, before joking: ‘I didn’t think it would last a week but it’s amazing it’s lasted 80 years.’

Mrs Kaye, 101, sees things a little differently, however, insisting: ‘We are very tolerant of each other and we do love each other.

‘You mustn’t be hard on each other. And if you have to give in a little bit, you give in a little bit.’

Yesterday the Kayes marked their oak wedding anniversary, making them one of Britain’s longest-married couples.

The couple  married in 1934 before they moved to Bournemouth after the war because their house and business  was destroyed by bombing

Over the decades they have endured more than their fair share of tragedy – losing two of their children and having their home bombed in the war.

But despite the difficult times, Mrs Kaye said it is their ability to laugh together that has helped them reach the landmark.

She said: ‘It’s been a wonderful marriage. It’s been hard work and not without tragedy but we’ve had so many good moments together.

‘It works because we just have the same sense of humour – we just laugh at the same things.’

It all began in 1929 when Mrs Kaye was 16 and working in her family’s womenswear shop in Walworth, South London.

Mr Kaye, 17, a travelling salesman, paid a visit and ended up staying for three hours, prompting his future mother-in-law to ask: ‘Who’s going to throw him out, you or me?’

Meanwhile, Mr Kaye had caught his future wife’s attention because he had a car. ‘In those days not very many people had cars, which made him interesting,’ she confessed. Five years later, they were married, having waited for Mrs Kaye’s older sister Paula to wed first.

Mr Kaye went on to manage his father’s factory and two shops in London before he joined the Army in 1939, leaving Mrs Kaye to run the business. Then, just before D-Day in 1944, the factory, shops and their home were destroyed in a bombing raid.

Neither was at home at the time but they soon fled to Bournemouth, where they have lived ever since after re-establishing their clothing business in the town. The couple faced more heartbreak when their son Anthony died of a burst appendix aged four. And they lost a daughter, Lesley, to a brain tumour in 1991 when she was in her 30s.

The couple, now aged 101 and 102 continue to live in their own home with a live-in carer

Today their surviving children Larry and Tina visit them in their flat regularly, and so do their seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Although they have a live-in carer, they keep sharp by playing bridge.

Larry, 66, said he thought the secret to his parents’ longevity was setting targets. ‘They wanted to see their grandchildren, and now they want to see their great-grandchildren grow up,’ he said.

The record for Britain’s longest-married couple is thought to be held by Karam and Katari Chand from Bradford, who wed in 1925.

Two of the couple's four children have died although their remaining son and daughter, Larry and Tina are regular visitors along with their seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren
