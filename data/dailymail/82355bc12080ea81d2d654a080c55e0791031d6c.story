A man long considered the prime suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz more than three decades ago was released from prison today and then immediately arrested on a Megan's Law violation.

Jose Antonio Ramos, 69, was taken into custody following his release from a northeastern Pennsylvania prison - where he spent more than 20 years for molesting children - because he failed to provide accurate information required of sex offenders, according to state police.

State police did not immediately specify what information Ramos failed to supply.

The 69-year-old has long been suspected in the disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz, who vanished May 25, 1979, after leaving his Manhattan home to go to a bus stop two blocks away.

It was the first time his parents had let him go off to school alone.

Megan's Law - also known as the Sexual Offender Act of 1994 -  was established after the murder of Megan Kanka, from New Jersey, at the hands of her neighbor Jesse Timmendequas, a registered sex offender.

It requires persons convicted of sex crimes against children to notify local law enforcement of any change of address or employment after release from custody.

In 29 July, 1994, Timmendequas lured the seven-year-old into his house by offering to show her a puppy. He raped, beat, suffocated and murdered her, had sex with her dead body before dumping it in a nearby park. 

It was largely held that if Megan's parents knew they were living next to a convicted sex offender, she would still be alive today.

Since 2004, the public has been able to view information on sex offenders required to register with local law enforcement, when previously the information was only available by personally visiting police stations and sheriff offices.

Kanka's family set up a charitable foundation, the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, with the aim of preventing crimes against children.

Investigators in Etan's case have long
been focused on Ramos, who had been dating the boy's baby sitter and 
later served the time in Pennsylvania for molesting two other boys.

Etan's disappearance prompted a 
massive search that stretched as far as Israel and spawned the national 
movement to publicize the cases of missing children. 

The blond, blue-eyed boy's photo was 
among the first put on milk cartons, and his case turned May 25 into 
National Missing Children's Day.

His parents never moved or changed their phone number, in case he returned.

In 2001, they obtained a court order 
officially declaring their son dead. They have become outspoken 
advocates for child protection issues.

Ramos was declared responsible for 
Etan's death in a civil court in 2004, but the Manhattan district 
attorney's office has said there wasn't enough evidence to charge him 
criminally. Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance.

Earlier this year, a new suspect 
named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said 
he confessed this spring.

His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said 
Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional
evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission.

Prosecutors are expected this month to
announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue 
pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store 
near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled 
the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag.

Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance.

He has declined interview requests while incarcerated, telling reporters 
he may make a public statement after his November 7 release.

In the 
early 1980s, Ramos was arrested but not convicted on charges he tried to
lure children to a drainage pipe he was living in.

At the time of his arrest, photos of young blond boys, similar to Etan, were found in his backpack.

After his release, Ramos traveled the country attending gatherings of the Rainbow
Family of Living Light, a loose collection of peace activists.

Then
in the mid-1980s he again faced child molestation charges when he was 
accused of luring three boys into his bus and assaulting them at two of 
the group's gatherings in Pennsylvania.

'He had 
thousands of dollars in 'Star Wars' toys on his bus. He had videotapes, 
and he had all kinds of materials he used to lure children inside,' 
Barry Adams, a longtime Rainbow member, recalled last month from his 
Montana home. 'It was a horrendous circumstance from A to Z.'

Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Etan's father Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy?' written on the back.

Earlier this year, a new suspect named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said he confessed this spring.

His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said that Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission.

Prosecutors are expected this month to announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag.

Since his 
confession, an extensive probe has found no hard evidence that could 
link Hernandez to the crime and his attorney has raised even more doubts
about the case saying that his client suffers from schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, and has heard voices.

'He either did it, or he really believes he did it,' a source in the district attorney's office told the New York Post.
