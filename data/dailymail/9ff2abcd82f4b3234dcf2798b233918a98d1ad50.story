An academy in south London has banned popular slang words used by pupils in an effort to improve standards of English.

No longer will words and phrases such as 'you woz', 'bare' and 'innit' be tolerated in the corridors of Harris Academy in Upper Norwood, one of 27 academies and free cchools in and around London sponsored by the Harris Federation.

The school has put up signs with a list of 'banned words' - including 'extra', 'innit' and 'like', as well as beginning sentences with 'basically' or ending them with 'yeah'.

Crackdown: No longer will words and phrases such as 'you woz', 'bare' and 'innit' be tolerated in the corridors of Harris Academy in Upper Norwood

Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy defended the move, only lamenting that 'sup blood' was not included.

He said: 'I think this is a very good idea. Speaking slang is fine in a social setting but a school should be a professional, educational environment and if part of that means banning slang then that’s fine by me.

'Too often I see young people going into job interviews or writing cover letters without being able to use correct English. Any attempts to change that should be encouraged.

'Not many employers would tolerate their staff using words like "innit" when speaking to customers or clients, so the school is right to try to discourage the use of this language in classrooms.

David Lammy has reported that an academy in South London has banned some slang words, such as 'bare' and 'extra'

'Given the huge levels of youth unemployment we are experiencing under the current government, it is more important than ever that schools do what they can to prepare students for working life, and teaching good communication skills is a vital part of that.

'I think it is fairly obvious to most people that anyone who goes into a job interview with a good grasp of the English language will have an automatic advantage over someone that doesn’t.

'The issue here isn’t about slang itself, but about the context it is used in. Language is an important part of any culture, and young people will always have their own slang.

'But young people need versatility; using slang is fine in some situations, but the ability to also speak good English is absolutely crucial in any workplace, and it is something that every school should be teaching its students.'

'Those saying this is an attack on culture are completely missing that point: no one is saying slang is bad, but simply that it shouldn’t be the only way that one is capable of communicating.'

But the move was criticised by some online observers. Science blogger and academic Alice Bell tweeted: 'Saddo limited approach to language, innit', while Becky Middleton said: 'Wow. Good luck enforcing that.'

But children's book illustrator Siân Schiaparelli tweeted: 'Sensible to teach kids to speak appropriately in formal contexts. Handy for job interviews, innit.

'Everyone is acting as if it's like when Victorian kids were caned for speaking Welsh. Language could secure them a better future.'

Joannepsi added: 'Fantastic - I have conducted job interviews with applicants who pepper their speech with these words. They didn't get the job.'

Harris Academy was not available for comment tonight.

The Harris Academy in Upper Norwood, where the ban has been implemented

Last year an academy in Sheffield banned slang and 'text talk' over fears pupils' command of English would adversely affect them in job interviews.

Kathy August, deputy chief executive of the city's United Learning Trust, which runs the city's Spring Academy, said: 'What we want to make sure of is that they are confident in using standard English. Slang doesn't really give the right impression of the person.

'Youngsters going to interviews for their first job need to make a good impression so that employers have confidence in them.

'It's not difficult to get youngster out of the habit of using slang.'

Coz - short for 'because'. As in 'Care is required in handling elemental sodium coz it generates flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide upon contact with water'.

Like - Often used erroneously in sentences. American in origin. For example: 'School dinner was, like, lasagna'.

Bare - Very, a lot of. For example: 'Shakespeare had bare influence on the English language'.

Extra - pointless, stupid, weird or just plain dumb. 'Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis is extra'.

Innit - Isn't it? As in: 'The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the world's oceans, innit?
