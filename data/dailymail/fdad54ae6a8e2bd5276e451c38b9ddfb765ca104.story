Manchester City and Bayern Munich are no stranger to one another in the Champions League group stage.

They meet at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night for the fifth time in the past three years.

And it’s fair to say their encounters invariably throw up headline news.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at their previous meetings…

Bayern 2-0 City – 27 Sep, 2011, Group stage

With City trailing by two and with more than half an hour left on the clock, Roberto Mancini instructed substitute Carlos Tevez to get warmed up.

The Argentine, infamously, refused. And so began a saga which saw Tevez exiled from the first team for six months, Mancini having said after the game that he would never play for the club again.

The visitors had earlier been outclassed and were blown away by a Mario Gomez double before the break.

After refusing to come on as a substitute, Tevez was dropped from the side until the following March

First he reacted quickest after Joe Hart had saved Franck Ribery’s free-kick, and again he seized upon a rebound from the goalkeeper to make it two.

City found little by way of a response after half-time but it was Tevez’s refusal to aid his team-mates’ cause which made the headlines.

He returned to the team in March and played a key role in their title victory, earning forgiveness for his meltdown in Munich.

City 2-0 Bayern – 7 Dec, 2011, Group stage

The significance of a win over Bayern - albeit a weakened version - was relegated by events elsewhere as Napoli beat Villarreal to claim second place behind the German table toppers.

For defeats in Bavaria and Naples meant Roberto Mancini’s side had surrendered their own fate going into the final group game.

Nonetheless, they saw home their end of the bargain and, for a while, it looked as though they might just scrape through into the knockout stages.

But when news filtered through that Gokhan Inler had scored for Napoli in Spain, an eerie silence descended on the Etihad.

Earlier, David Silva fired a sublime opener as he defied the odds to locate the bottom corner with a sweet left-footed strike.

Edin Dzeko had been the provider for that goal and he again assisted as Yaya Toure added a second after the break with a low poke having been slipped through on goal.

But it mattered not and the Europa League beckoned for Mancini’s men.

City 1-3 Bayern – 2 Oct, 2013, Group stage

A win for Munich? Or a defeat for City? For the hosts were so poor that Bayern barely had to break sweat.

But one man who was left sweating on his place in the City side was Joe Hart after a horror performance which raised questions over his credentials as England’s No 1.

The game was only seven minutes old when he allowed Franck Ribery’s shot from range to escape his grasp and snake across the line.

Hart's poor performance eventually led to him being dropped from the City side following the Bayern match

Gael Clichy was another enduring a torrid evening and he was at fault as Thomas Muller skipped clear before rounding Hart for Bayern’s second.

By the hour mark it was three, Arjen Robben beating the forlorn Clichy with ease before firing beyond Hart who made a feeble attempt to cover his near post.

A late rally - in which Alvaro Negredo scored a fine consolation and Jerome Boateng was sent off the visitors - did not mask what was a worrying display, particularly from Hart who was subsequently benched.

Bayern 2-3 City – 12 Dec, 2013, Group stage

This was supposed to be the night when City came of age in Europe, reversing a two-goal deficit to win at the home of the European champions.

Instead, it was a different number for which the thrilling contest was remembered - away goals, or rather, Manuel Pellegrini’s failure to grasp the concept of them.

A 4-2 victory would have taken City through as group champions, the result bettering Bayern’s 3-1 win at the Etihad with the sides level on points.

And Pellegrini’s maths malfunction - which saw him put on Jack Rodwell rather than Sergio Aguero when they should have been chasing a fourth goal - cost his team dear as they were drawn against Barcelona in the next round and were duly eliminated.

It had, though, been a devastating display.

They were trailing by two inside 12 minutes. Thomas Muller raced clear before finishing beyond Joe Hart - restored to the side having been dropped in October - and the goalkeeper was picking the ball from his net soon after when Mario Gotze prodded in from close range.

City had played a weakened team for what had appeared a dead rubber and it was one of those brought in, James Milner, who was key to their comeback.

First, on 28 minutes, he nodded into the path of David Silva who halved the deficit. It was then Milner who won the penalty from which Alexsandar Kolarov drew parity just before the hour mark.

And so it was left to Milner himself to produce a stunning winner with a measured curler from the edge of the area.

Substitute Alvaro Negredo was denied by Manuel Neuer as City came close to a fourth and top spot, it was just a shame Pellegrini hadn’t realised such.
