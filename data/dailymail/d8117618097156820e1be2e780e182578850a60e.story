As parents rush to fill their children's stocking ahead of Christmas, a list featuring toys from both the past and present that Brits thought were simply unforgettable has been released.

Retro favourites Space Hoppers, My Little Pony and Mr Potato Head join more recent classics such as Buzz Lightyear figures, Furbies and Tamagotchis in being named some of the most iconic children’s toys ever.

Entries from the Toy Story franchise proved popular after the release of the first movie in 1995 and were remembered for their appearance again in 2010 after Toy Story 3 was made.

Iconic: A new list  features toys from both the past and present that Brits thought were simply unforgettable, from Space Hoppers, Connect 4 and Cluedo to Furbies, Sylvanian families, Game Boy and My Little Pony

Other blasts from the pasts included the 1966 Viewmaster, the 1982 Glo Worm that lit up when squeezed, slinkies and Care Bears that are still stocked today.

In the Nineties, electronic talking Furbies and handheld digital pets, more commonly known as Tamagotchis, were the must-have toys.

Modern day entries included the Xbox One, the Elsa doll from Frozen and Nerf guns. 

One respondent said: 'The most iconic toy ever has to be the Viewmaster, it’s an absolute classic. It’s weird to think how simple the concept actually was but they were such a big hit. It’s a shame my children will never understand the appeal.'

Another said: 'I remember getting a Tamagotchi for Christmas and being absolutely delighted. I think it was the best present I ever got.

'If I could still walk around now with my handheld Tamagotchi and not be looked at weirdly then I definitely would.'

Another added said: 'I have to say that the Toy Story merchandise will always be the most iconic. I remember struggling to get my son the Buzz Lightyear figure back in 1995, it was sold out literally everywhere. Buzz is such an icon.'

A spokesperson for MobileSlots.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'There have been a lot of amazing toys over the years, it’s interesting to see how something so simple like a Viewmaster was once seen as iconic and nowadays they’ve been replaced by games consoles and gadgets.

'Toys have also become more iconic off the back of popular animated films like with Toy Story and currently with the Frozen frenzy. Merchandise is a big part of the toy scene.'

Then and now: Rubik's Cube baffled children in the Eighties but now it's all about the Frozen Elsa doll, right

Remember them? Sylvanian families were the biggest seller of 1987.

The Lilliputian animal characters included a meerkat, bear and bunny families who lived in dolls' houses stuffed with collectable furniture

But if you're looking to snap up an Elsa doll, a nightmare looms this Christmas with evidence there is a desperate shortage of Britain’s best-selling doll. 

Stores are unable to keep up with demand for Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, an interactive doll that sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99.

Many household chains and websites, such as Tesco, Toys R Us and Argos, list it as being ‘unavailable’, while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves.

Such is the demand from parents desperate to avoid tears on Christmas morning that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £79.99 - a mark-up of almost 130 per cent.

Elsa, the lead character from Disney’s Frozen film, is driving a phenomenal surge in sales in a wide range of merchandise linked to the inspirational animated fairy tale.

Sales of dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit an all-time high for any movie franchise – overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story.
