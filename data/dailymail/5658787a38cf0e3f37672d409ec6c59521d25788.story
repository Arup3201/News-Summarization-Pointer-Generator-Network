A pair of twins have been born to a mother in Kansas City, but their birthdays are more than a month apart.

Carl is more than five weeks older than his brother David.

The two tiny little boys came into the world in such a staggered fashion after a rare and risky delivery.

David and Carl: Two tiny little boys thriving in the Kansas City area are twins, but their birthdays are more than a month apart

Living life: Carl (left) was born 39 days ahead of his brother, David

Baby bracelet: At one stage Carl was so tiny that his mom was able to slide her wedding ring onto his wrist.

The boys' father, David Cowan, is an emergency room doctor.

He and his wife Elene live in Saudi Arabia but wanted to have the children born in the United States.

The couple flew back to the Kansas City area for her to give birth when she was 23 weeks pregnant.

But within hours of their plane landing, a complication occurred.

Surprise arrival: Elene Cowan was just 23 weeks pregnant when she went into labor early and gave birth to the first twin

Four months on: Carl remains on oxygen, but the boys' proud mother is enthralled and overwhelmed

Lucky lady: 'I am so grateful to God and the prayers from everyone,' mom, Elene Cowan said

Doctors told them that the amniotic sac holding baby Carl was bulging and that she was in labor.

Although they fought to prevent the labor from happening, Carl was coming out whether or not he was ready and at just 24 weeks, Elene delivered her first child.

'It's the hardest thing in my life that I've ever done,' Mrs Cowan said to KCTV. 'I thought that he would die and this really isn't a baby,' Elene Cowan recalled. 'There's no way he's going to make it.'

Weighting just over a pound, the baby was so small that she was able to slide her wedding ring onto his wrist.

After giving birth to Carl, doctors ordered bed rest for Mrs Cowan.

Almost 40 days later after Carl's delivery, David was born.

I'm your daddy: David Cowan is an emergency room doctor in Saudi Arabia and flew back with his wife to Kansas City in order for her to give birth

Doing everything they can: After Carl's birth, doctors literally tied his mother's cervix shut and put her on complete bed rest. She did everything for little David Jr. in her womb while Carl continued to gain a little bit of strength every day

'David was 2.9 pounds and I thought, 'Oh my word, this is a real baby,' his mother recalled.

Four months on, both boys are back at home with their mother.

Little Carl is still on oxygen but the babies are both growing stronger everyday.

Their father is now back in Saudi Arabia on the job. His wife and children will be heading over there as soon as the boys are well enough to travel.
