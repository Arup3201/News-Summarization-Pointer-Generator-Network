If you thought the Americans had cornered the market on super-sized portions then think again.

Because the USA has got some competition in the eating stakes and it comes in the unlikely form of Japan.

After generations of staying slim on modest portions of rice, noodles and vegetables a newly affluent wave of Japanese society are enjoying a western style boom in big eating.

Supersize me: An enormous bowl of rice is dwarfed by an even bigger stack of katsu chicken and accompanied by a salad

Supersized sushi: This enormous sushi wrap is stuffed with large chunks of fish and is served up on a plate the size of a tray

These remarkable pictures show the growing popularity of such 'mega meals' with delighted customers photographing their food and posting it online.

Known as 'ohmori' or 'large serving' this departure from traditional meal sizes have become increasingly popular amongst more adventurous - or greedy - Japanese.

Recently one Japan's largest web forums encouraged users to upload their favourite images of 'mega ohmori' or mega large meals.

Noodle Mountain: The presence of a man's torso in the background of this photo demonstrates just how tall this pile of noodles is

'Ohmori': The trend for super-sized meals has grown in popularity over the last few years with many happy diners choosing to photograph their food and post it online

This selection of photos were put together by popular Japanese website Kotaku.com who published it earlier this month.

Amongst the favourites is a sushi roll stuffed with large chunks of fish which looks like it could easily feed a family of four let alone provide a handy lunch.

In another shot, this time of a noodle dish, only the torso of a man in the background serves to demonstrate just how massive the pile is. 

Quite a handful: One diner, right, includes his own hand in the picture to demonstrate the size of his rice dish which itself appears to swim in a lake of sauce while left, a huge bowl of beansprouts threatens to overflow

Mega meal: Traditionally in Japan it is considered rude not to finish all the food in front of you but it seems impossible that any diner could have managed this without help

Compare: One restaurant shows off the size of its meals by putting them next to normal sized version, the chicken on the left measures 25 cm and weighs 2kg while this bowl of noodles, right, comes in at 1.5kg

Many restaurants are now cashing in on the craze, using particularly extravagant stacks of food as publicity stunts to bring customers through the door.

But such enthusiasm for stomach-busting meals may seem like something of a risk to take in a country where is it considered extremely rude not to finish everything on your plate - it's certainly hard to believe it was achieved without some considerable help.
