People consume 200 extra calories a day when eating at a restaurant compared to dining at home, a new study has revealed.

Researchers have found that adults who eat out take in more calories, sugar, saturated fat and salt than when they stay in to eat, whether they are at a fast food outlet or a formal restaurant with full table service.

The study published online by the journal Public Health Nutrition, backs up previous research linking eating out to people consuming more calories.

People can consume an extra 200 calories a day if they eat out at a restaurant, new research has revealed

This includes data which shows adults, who reported eating fast food, consumed more calories, fat and salt as well as less fruit, vegetables and vitamins compared to those who don't eat it.

The research was conducted by Binh Nguyen of the American Cancer Society and Lisa Powell of Chicago University.

They used data from more than 12,000 people aged 20 to 64, who were asked about visits to fast food and table service restaurants on two successive days.

The study found that on days when eating at a fast-food restaurant, there was a net increase of total energy intake by 194.49 calories, saturated fat by 3.48 grams, sugar by 3.95 grams and salt by 296.38mgs.

Researchers found that eating at fast food restaurants caused people to consume on around 194 calories a day more than if they ate at home

Eating at a table-service restaurant was also associated with a higher energy intake with diners consuming an extra 205.21 calories, and with higher intake of saturated fat by 2.52 grams and salt by 451.06mgs.

The study also found individual characteristics moderated the impact of restaurant food consumption.

Net energy intake was larger for black adults compared with their white and Hispanic counterparts and greater for middle-income compared to high-income adults.

Doctor Nguyen said: 'Our study confirms that adultsâ€™ fast-food and full-service restaurant consumption was associated with higher daily total energy intake and poorer dietary indicators.'

The researchers say the larger adverse effect they measured on energy intake for some lower socio-economic and minority populations has policy implications.

They say efforts to improve diet and reduce energy intake from restaurant sources could actually help to reduce racial and socio-economic disparities in diets.
