Paul Walker's family and friends gathered to say a final farewell to the tragic actor at an intimate Santa Barbara beach memorial on Sunday - one day after he was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

The star's 15-year-old daughter Meadow joined his 25-year-old brother Cody, his father and his mother as they laughed and remembered the actor the best way they could - by playing football and enjoying the warm weather.

Also beachside to reminisce about the life of the 40-year-old with his loved ones was Tyrese Gibson, who co-starred with Walker in the Fast & Furious franchise.

The choice of Santa Barbara also seems to have been the appropriate place for the memorial - Walker had long made the beautiful coastal stretch his home.

Indeed, after the fatal crash on November 30, the image of Tyrese Gibson breaking down in tears at the site of the accident has become one of the most iconic images of the actor's sad death.

After his service on Saturday, Tyrese posted a message onto Instagram which paid tribute to his friend.

'Today
 In a room full of your loved ones I wish today was your wedding 
instead,' Tyrese heartbreakingly posted along with a black and white 
photograph of Walker.

He
 went on...' I guess you can’t get all you ask for in life…. But our 
hearts are FULL from all the moments we DID have, 13 years of laughter 
and grace, humility and love….. Never did I take my access for 
granted….'

Support: Meadow Rain, 15, walks with friends along the Santa Barbara beach on Sunday - the day after her father was laid to rest in a low-key ceremony that was attended by friends and family as her grandfather (Paul Walker Snr.) walks with a friend towards the beach

And in a tragic interview with US Weekly in mid-November, Walker revealed how happy he was that his 15-year-old daughter was moving from Hawaii to California to live with him.

'I'm glad I had her at 25, because at 40 and 15, we're matching up sweet. It's just working,' Paul told the magazine.

'It's perfect,' he added.

Paul said he was looking forward to spending more quality time with Meadow and improving their communication.

Paul's close friends Ronn Shikari and Vince Krause, who both live in Hawaii, earlier this month said Paul was planning on giving up acting to spend more time with Meadow.

The teenager spent the first 14 years
 of her life in Hawaii with her mother Rebecca Soteros, before moving in
 with Paul recently in Santa Barbara.

'He
 was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time 
away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was 
his world,' Ronn said.

'That's
 why he wanted to retire from acting and talked to his family about it, 
as he’d achieved everything he wanted to achieve.'

On Saturday, the Fast & Furious franchise star, whose remains were cremated on Thursday was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, following a brief non-denominational ceremony attended by family and close friends.

According to the website, the ceremony took place at the Court Of Liberty, one of the cemetery's historical sites.

An American flag was allegedly folded in a triangle and displayed during the ceremony, and then given to the star's family.

More than three dozen people dressed in black and grey arrived at the landmark cemetery, where Walker's framed portrait has been set on an easel.

A pair of guards in white short-sleeve shirts, black berets and white cloves stood watch during the ceremony.

The family reportedly were hoping to keep the event private and is said to have asked those in attendance to arrive and leave together so they can be accompanied by a security escort.

Walker, best known for his roles in the "Fast & Furious" action movies, died on November 30 in a car crash in Southern California - which has led to an outpouring of grief nationwide

Ahead of the somber ceremony, Paul Walker's father, Walker Sr., was photographed driving his white KIA SUV towards the site of the burial.

A slew of celebrities are buried at the iconic Hollywood Hills cemetery, most notably Michael Jackson's tomb at Forest Lawn's Great Mausoleum.

Other stars laid to rest there include Liberace, Lucille Ball, John Ritter and Brittany Murphy.

According to RadarOnline, the Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in Glendale, California on Thursday.

A source told the website the family 'intends on dividing Paul's ashes between an urn and keepsakes.'

Walker was killed last month when the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita.

On Wednesday, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members finalised plans for the actor's funeral service. They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot.

His family will mourn the star in a very private service, though TMZ reported certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited because he considered them kin.

The Walkers were keen, however, to avoid throngs of media and fans, to protect the actor's daughter Meadow, 15, who is 'broken up' over her dad's death.
