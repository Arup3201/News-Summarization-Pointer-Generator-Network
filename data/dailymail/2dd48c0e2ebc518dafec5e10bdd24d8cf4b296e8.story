Sergio Aguero is the best striker in the world, according to Glenn Hoddle and Jamie Carragher.

The pair were speaking on Sky Sports ahead of Manchester City's trip to St. Mary's, where Manuel Pellegrini's side faced an in-form Southampton, who sit one place above them in the league.

City are third in the Premier League behind Chelsea and their weekend opponents, and have Aguero to thank for the majority of their goals so far this season. Hoddle was full of praise for the Argentinian.

'He's the best finisher in the world,' former Tottenham midfielder Hoddle said. 'He's just above [Diego] Costa at this moment in time. Where would City be without him? They'd certainly be out of the Champions League.

'As a defender, you may think you're marking him, but you're not. He's in between defenders, it's so hard to mark.'

Aguero had scored 17 goals in 18 appearances for Manuel Pellegrini's men going into Sunday's game, and Carragher believes that he is too good for the Champions League standard Manchester City have set in recent years.

During the match against Southampton, Aguero was booked for diving after what looked a blatant foul

Carragher said that Aguero should be winning the Champions League, and not just playing in it as he is now

'He's the best striker in the world. Man City need to freshen up. [Aguero] shouldn't [just] be  playing in the Champions League, he should be winning the Champions League.

'He comes alive 25, 30 yards from goal. Not on the half-way line, he doesn't want to get involved there.'
