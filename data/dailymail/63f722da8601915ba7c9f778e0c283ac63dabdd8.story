Figures reveal the corporation spent almost £2.5million on all-access tours but only made £1.2million back

The BBC is losing £600,000 of licence-fee payers’ cash every year running ‘vanity tours’ of its studios.

The tours are held at several BBC sites across the UK and cost between £9 and £13.50.

They offer visitors ‘behind-the-scenes’ access to programmes including Dragons’ Den and Match Of The Day.

But in just two years the BBC has lost £1.2 million running the tours, according to details obtained under Freedom of Information laws.

The broadcaster has earned £1,231,912 income from the tours but has forked out almost £2.5 million on running costs.

The popularity of tours differs vastly between different BBC buildings.

Only 18 people attended a tour of the BBC’s Cardiff studios in 2011/12.

Last night, Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tickets to tour the broadcaster shouldn’t be subsidised by the licence fee.

'Reducing the cost of taking visitors around the Beeb would mean more of the licence fee available for a better deal for all involved.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We know from feedback that visitors to the BBC enjoy our tours immensely.

'As the tours develop, and ticket income increases, we’ll ensure they provide the best value for money.’

The figures come just weeks after a report revealed BBC bosses lost £100million on a failed IT project.

The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was called off in May after the BBC admitted that to continue would be ‘throwing good money after bad’.

The number of visitors going behind the scenes of shows like Dragon's Den has been lower than expected

A review carried out by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed eight separate management boards were in charge of the project but none realised it was failing until it was too late.

Launched in 2008, the DMI was intended to digitise the BBC’s archive, enabling staff to share and download material remotely instead of having to transport tapes.

But it quickly ran into costly delays and became a joke among insiders, who referred to the project as ‘Don’t Mention It’.

When it was scrapped this year, bosses were forced to admit they had spent a total of £98.4million trying to make it work.
