Nicolas Anelka has been cleared to play for Mumbai City in Sunday's opening game of the Indian Super League. 

The former West Bromwich striker was banned for five games by the FA for his ‘quenelle’ gesture in December that was deemed anti-Semitic. 

But the Indians have allowed him to face Atletico de Kolkata after writing to FIFA for guidance but receiving no response.

Anelka's 'quenelle' gesture caused controversy and saw the then-West Brom striker banned for five games

Kushal Das, general secretary of AIFF, said: ‘We asked FIFA about his ban, but since we have not heard, he can play.’

Initially the ex-Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City forward saw his ban cut from five games to three. 

The 35-year-old protested his innocence claiming it was merely an appreciation of French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala who used the expression in his shows. 

On arriving as one of Mumbai's marquee players, the FA and had asked FIFA and the Indian Federation to uphold the ban.
