Safe and well: Ewan Powell was last seen on Saturday with his daughter Tanith before they were both located this evening

A divorced father who went missing with his three-year-old daughter on Saturday have both been found safe and well.

Thames Valley Police confirmed that Ewan Powell and his daughter Tanith were located this evening.

Ewan Powell was last seen on Saturday at his former wife's home in Worcestershire before he then disappeared with their daughter Tanith.

His ex-wife Kate Jonkers was due to collect their daughter on Monday after the pre-arranged weekend visit.

Police managed to speak to the 42-year-old IT worker on the phone on Monday but could not contact him again until this evening.

The pair were found in the Didcot area of Oxford.

Mr Powell was arrested at the scene and he is being questioned by detectives in connection with his daughter's disappearance.

A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said:

'Missing man Ewan Powell, aged 42, of Benson, Oxfordshire and his daughter Tanith Powell, aged three, from Worcestershire have both been found safe and well today in the Didcot area.

'We would like to thank the public and the media for their assistance locating them.'
