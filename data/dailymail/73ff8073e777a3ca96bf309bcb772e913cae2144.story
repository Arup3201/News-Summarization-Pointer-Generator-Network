Reforms: Jordan's King Abdullah. Despite human rights advances, The European Commission admits the country still falls behind on international standards

British taxpayers have spent more 
than £10million on Jordan in a futile battle to return hate preacher Abu
Qatada to the Middle East state.

The
cash, funded through Foreign Office handouts and EU grants, has 
financed a range of human rights reforms to try to bring one of 
Britain’s closest military allies in line with European standards of justice.

But last week Qatada’s deportation 
was blocked after a court ruled there was a real risk that evidence 
obtained through torture might be used against him.

The controversial cleric must stay in London with his family under house arrest.

Britain’s security services still regard him as capable of supporting Al Qaeda terror operations in the UK.

The
£10million handouts are on top of the £3million legal bill for Qatada’s
failed deportation and the on-going £5million-a-year cost of keeping 
him in the UK.

But
despite millions of pounds of British taxpayers’ money and the 
Government’s frustration, Jordan is still not a fit country to receive 
Muslim terror suspects.

Last
year the Foreign Office spent a record £1.5million directly from 
Treasury coffers to help pay for a justice system free from the risk of 
torture and other human rights abuses.

And since 2008, Britain has contributed £4.26million to an EU human rights aid budget for Jordan.

This year the EU pledged £3.8million from the UK contribution to improve human rights and democracy in Jordan.

Among
the projects part paid for by UK taxpayers is a human rights centre in 
Jordan’s capital Amman directly funded by the Foreign Office.

Other
EU and FCO projects are aimed at reforming the justice system, 
electoral system and an open national media.

They include a  €158,000 grant for ‘strengthening the capacity
of local societies to better understand human rights issues’ and a 
€193,000 grant to ‘reverse the gender bias against Jordanian women 
married to foreigners’.

This
week, nearly ten years after Britain first began the process of 
deporting Qatada, Home Office officials were dispatched to Jordan once 
again to try to resolve the human rights issue.

Earlier
this year, Europe’s human rights judges ruled that Qatada could not be 
returned to Jordan because of its sub-standard criminal justice system, a
ruling followed by British judges last week.

In February, Baroness Ashton, head of
EU foreign policy, heaped praise on Jordan’s progress on human rights 
in support of the on-going aid programme.

On
a trip to Jordan, she said: ‘Many in the world look to Jordan. You have
announced these important reforms, you follow a Jordanian model that we
admire very much... a model for the region, a democratic constitutional monarchy.’

But
in May this year, officials working for Baroness Ashton reported 
concerns about Jordan’s human rights record, including allegations of 
the ‘severe abuse of detainees’.

In
the document seen by The Mail on Sunday, it was also reported that the 
Jordanian government had not fully signed up to an international treaty 
outlawing torture.

In the same month an EU sub-committee pressed Jordan to introduce reforms to ‘prevent any acts of torture’.

A
recent Human Rights Watch’s report said that ‘despite a lack of 
progress, and a number of reverses’, EU assistance to Jordan increased 
by 12 per cent.

As recently as last month 
Amnesty International condemned Jordan for a  crackdown against 
pro-reform activists. It said: ‘The 20 men will be tried by the 
country’s State Security Court, a special court whose procedures fail  to meet international fair-trial standards.’

Last
night the European Commission admitted that despite all the money 
lavished on the country, Jordan had failed to tackle its human rights 
problems.

A
spokesman said: ‘The rationale for these actions is a mutual 
recognition that there is major work to be done to bring the Jordanian 
judicial system into line with best international standards.

‘There
is no attempt to hide the fact that in a wide range of political and 
social spheres, human rights in Jordan need to be improved on.

‘The Jordanian authorities have recognised this and are taking steps, with our help, to remedy the situation.’
