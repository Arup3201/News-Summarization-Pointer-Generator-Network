Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has signed a two-year deal with Australia Twenty20 franchise the Melbourne Stars.

Pietersen has primarily played as a T20 specialist after being sacked by England following the fallout of their Ashes whitewash last winter.

The 34-year-old captained the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League earlier this year, has turned out for Surrey in the NatWest T20 Blast and is set to feature for St Lucia Zouks in the Caribbean Premier League, which has already started.

Signing for the Stars, who reached the
 semi-finals in the last edition, will see him line up alongside 
compatriot Luke Wright and Glenn Maxwell.

'I'm
 very excited about joining the Melbourne Stars and look forward to 
playing with some of Australia's best T20 cricketers,' Pietersen said.

'Joining
 the Melbourne Stars was an easy choice for me when you look at the 
players we have and the amazing off-field support staff, and don't 
forget our home ground, the MCG.'

The
 tournament usually gets under way in December with the latest edition 
finishing in February, and a similar schedule this season would mean 
Pietersen is in Australia while the current England team play a 
triangular series Down Under, also featuring India, which runs from the 
middle to the end of next January.
