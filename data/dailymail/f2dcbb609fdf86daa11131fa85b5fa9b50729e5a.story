Sevilla's pursuit of La Liga's top four was boosted by a 3-0 victory over Elche at the weekend, but the victory has gained notoriety thanks to a player that did not even make it onto the pitch.

Fernando Navarro, a defender who was part of Spain's Euro 2008 winning team, appeared to decide upon relieving himself on the substitutes bench during his team's victory. 

A video shows Navarro grabbing an empty bottle before holding a jersey over his waist, with the help of striker Carlos Bacca, who had been taken off after scoring twice for his team.

Navarro must have thought he would  get away with not being seen, and not having to go to his team's dressing room, but a camera caught the entire incident.

Sevilla are four points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid in the Spanish league, with eleven games remaining in the  season.

But Sevilla face difficult opposition in their next game on Sunday. They travel to sixth-placed Villarreal who are only three points behind Unai Emery's side.
