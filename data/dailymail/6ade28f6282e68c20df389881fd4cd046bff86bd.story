A vicar who became the first Church of England priest to undergo a sex change and return to the pulpit as a woman has died from cancer.

Rev Carol Stone was ordained in 1978 as male vicar Rev Peter Stone but had spent almost 15 years as a woman following a sex swap in 2000.

Twice-divorced with a daughter, she stunned parishioners at St Philip's in Upper Stratton, near Swindon in Wiltshire when she announced she was changing from man to woman.

She said she never dreamed she would be allowed to return to her post, but Church of England bosses said there was nothing to stop her.

A local police officer attended her return service and one pensioner was escorted for an outburst during her sermon but it ended with a standing ovation from her congregation.

She died at the age of 60 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

The Rt Rev Lee Rayfield, the Bishop of Swindon paid tribute to her today.

He said: 'She and her colleagues really worked hard and overcame one setback after another, 

'She really was a true priest who overcame a huge amount in her life and a huge amount with other people, and I'll remember her with great affection.'
