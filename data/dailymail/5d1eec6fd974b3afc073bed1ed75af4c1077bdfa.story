TV presenter Chris Tarrant suffered a mini stroke during an 11-hour flight, it was revealed yesterday.

The 67-year-old Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host needed emergency treatment to remove a potentially fatal blood clot. He was initially thought to have suffered a bad asthma attack on the flight from Bangkok.

But on landing at Heathrow he was taken to hospital where doctors discovered a clot in his leg. It is thought part of the clot broke away and lodged in a blood vessel in his head, causing a temporary loss of blood to the brain.

'Remarkable recovery': Chris Tarrant's agent said that the star is making good progress after suffering a mini-stroke on the way back from Thailand

Experts say sitting on a plane for so
 long may have helped Tarrant’s clot to form. The symptoms of a mini 
stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, are similar to those of a stroke –
 numbness in the face and limbs, and slurred speech – but they last for 
less than 24 hours.

In most
 cases they ease within minutes but a mini stroke is often a warning 
that a person is at risk of suffering a potentially fatal stroke.

Tarrant
 at first believed he was having an asthma attack brought on by the poor
 air quality in Burma, where he had been filming the second series of 
his Extreme Railways documentaries before flying home from Thailand.

Yesterday,
 Tarrant’s manager Paul Vaughan confirmed the presenter has been 
receiving treatment at London’s Charing Cross Hospital since March 1.

The father of four is expected to leave hospital today or tomorrow.

‘He has had the best possible care,’ Mr Vaughan said. ‘It was quite a shock, but now he just wants to get back home.

‘He’s
 in good spirits. He is hugely grateful for the care he has received and
 all the kind wishes he has been receiving on a daily basis.’

Mr Vaughan added: ‘He's speaking very well, he's moving, he's walking and wanting to go out and about. He doesn’t like lying in hospital. It’s all very positive. The doctors have been wanting to make certain everything was all right.’

The TV presenter was taken from the tarmac at Heathrow to Charing Cross Hospital in west London, where he was seen by emergency doctors

The
 hospital and consultant treating Tarrant is the same that looked after 
TV presenter Andrew Marr when he suffered a stroke last year.

Marr has described how he was struck by 'a blinding headache and flashes of light'.

He woke up the next morning lying on his bedroom floor, unable to move.

He was paralysed down his left side but the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected.

Stroke is a 'brain attack', according to the Stroke Association.

Its website says: 'For your brain to function, it needs a constant blood supply, which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and brain cells are damaged or die.

'About a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a month. But most stroke survivors will have long-term problems. It may take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery. Sadly, in the most severe cases, strokes can be fatal or cause long-term disability.'

It says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the FAST test:

1) Facial weakness - can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?2) Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms?3) Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?4) Time to call 999.

The Stroke Association says that failing any of these tests means it's a medical emergency and it's time to call 999.
