A small Ohio college has been evacuated because of a bomb threat, campus officials announced late on Friday, making it the third university in less than 24 hours.

Hiram College posted a statement on its website saying it received a bomb threat Friday afternoon and is taking the threat seriously.

The school says safety teams with bomb-sniffing dogs are checking all campus buildings. Students with no other place to go are being directed to the local fire department.

University of Texas students evacuate campus after the university received a bomb threat on Friday morning in Austin, Texas

The Universities of Texas at Austin 
and  North Dakota State University in Fargo both rushed to  evacuate 
this morning after receiving terror threats from a man claiming to be 
with al Qaeda - but after a thorough search of the premises no bombs 
were found and it was not clear whether the threats were related.

Initially the large two schools did 
not take the threat's 100 percent seriously, but the febrile political 
atmosphere in light of the attacks on U.S. embassies abroad caused the 
university's to order their staff and students from all buildings on 
their property.

Just 
yesterday a U.S. intelligence bulletin warned that the violent outrage 
aimed at U.S. embassies caused by a YouTube film mocking the Prophet 
Mohammed could spread to America.

University of Texas at Austin Director of Communications Rhonda Weldon said the university got a
call around 8:35 a.m. from a male with a middle eastern accent claiming
to have placed bombs all over the 50,000-student Austin campus.

He claimed the bombs would go off in 90 minutes and all buildings were evacuated at 9:50 a.m. as a precaution, Weldon said.

The deadline passed without incident, and the university later issued 
advisories saying all buildings had been cleared and were reopening by 
noon. Classes were canceled for the remainder of Friday, but other 
university activities were to resume by 5 p.m.

'We’re extremely confident that the campus is safe. We are allowing 
people to go back into buildings,' university President Bill Powers said
at a press conference on campus today a little after noon.

In Texas, an FBI spokesman said that no arrests had been made yet but 
that law enforcement authorities were aggressively searching for the 
culprit.

'We are aggressively looking for this individual. We take these things 
pretty seriously for obvious reasons of public panic, the response of 
local authorities and that cost. We treat every one of these as if 
they're real until we know they are not,' said Erick Vasys.

North Dakota State University President Dean Bresciani said 20,000 
people also were evacuated from his school’s main and downtown campuses 
in Fargo after the school received its bomb threat Friday morning.

The
university says is will re-open campus at 1 p.m. CDT and classes will 
resume at 2 p.m. It says university police will spend the next hour 
unlocking university buildings.

The
evacuation order at NDSU came about the same time as one at The 
University of Texas at Austin, where officials also say they received a 
bomb threat. FBI spokesman Kyle Loven says the agency is trying to 
determine if the two threats were related.

In Texas, sirens wailed on campus and cellphones pinged with text 
messages when the initial alert when out. Students described more 
confusion than panic as they exited the sprawling campus in what one 
described as an ‘orderly but tense' manner.

Students said they were 
directed off campus by university staff.

‘One of them said to me ‘get off this campus as soon as possible,'’ 
said Elizabeth Gerberich, an 18-year-old freshman from New Jersey.

Police blocked off roads heading into campus as lines of cars sat in gridlock trying to get out.

Ashley Moran, a freshman from 
Houston, said she was waiting to get into class when word quickly began 
spreading among students to leave immediately.

There are over 45,000 students and 15,000 academic and support staff working on campus at the University of Texas at Austin

'It makes me really nervous I just know we’re supposed to get out,’' she said.

With rain falling, students stood 
under awnings and overhangs and inundated nearby off-campus restaurants 
and coffee shops as they waited to find out when classes would resume.

Abby Johnston, a production and 
special editions coordinator for Texas Student Media, said she received 
the first text message from the university less than an hour after she 
arrived at work and started thinking about what she would publish in the
next day’s paper. Then sirens started blaring.

‘We do the siren test once a month 
and so at first people thought maybe it was just a test, and then we 
started to tell everybody, ‘No actually we have to get out of here 
pretty immediately,' said Johnston, 22. ‘There was definitely a little 
bit of nervous tension.’

Tania Lara, a graduate student at the
Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said she was at work inside
a central campus academic building when she got a text message to get 
as far away was possible.

‘It was calm but nobody knew what was
going on,’ she said, describing a crush of students heading for the 
exits. ‘No one was yelling ‘get out of here’ or anything like that.’

At 9.50 a.m. an instruction was issued onto the university website to evacuate.

'Immediately evacuate ALL buildings and 
get as far away as possible,' read the message posted at 9:53 a.m. by the Texas university 
campus' emergency alert website. 'More information to come.'

The university President Williams Powers was notified, and officials hurried to leave all of the buildings as a precaution.

According to local news students appeared to leave campus in an orderly and calm manner.

By 10:30 
a.m., the university issued another advisory saying that buildings were 
still being checked and that no decision had been made on whether the 
campus would reopen for afternoon classes.

Ashley
Moran, a freshman from Houston, said she was waiting to get into class 
when word quickly began spreading among students to leave immediately. 
She described the evacuation as orderly but tense.

'It makes me really nervous I just know we're supposed to get out,' she said.

This morning an UT-Austin spokesman, told USA TODAY: 'We have emptied the buildings and we have told folks to stay far 
away,' said Tara Doolittle.

'No decision has been made on whether to hold afternoon 
classes. We're working with local and federal law enforcement to ensure 
that the campus is secure.'

One University of Texas at Austin student explained how no one was unduly worried at first by the alert.

'Everyone was on the phone ,and I thought it was normal,' said Bethany Wagner.

'It became too much when I went by the tower and 500 people were walking
away. A man said, ‘Get away from the buildings!’ I think he was just
being overzealous.

'No one is taking it seriously, everyone was laughing.
But if something happens I want to be by the action.'

North Dakota State University in Fargo has also received a bomb threat this morning and has evacuated its campus just like University of Texas at Austin

Meanwhile, over 1,000 miles north in Fargo, the campus of North Dakota State University was evacuated after a bomb threat was phoned in this morning.

An emergency message sent out to students and posted on the university's
website this morning ordered all students and employees to leave campus
by 10:15 a.m.

'This is an emergency message from North Dakota State University,' read the alert.

'NDSU is requiring all employees and students to 
leave campus by 10:15 a.m.

'This includes residence hall students, who, 
if necessary, should walk to locations off campus. This also includes 
the downtown buildings and agricultural facilities. 

'NDSU received a bomb threat, prompting this evacuation.  Updates will follow. '

More than 20,000 students are enrolled at NDSU.

The bomb threats at the universities followed a U.S. intelligence 
bulletin that warned the violent outrage aimed at U.S. embassies could spread to America.

The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI said, 'the risk of violence could increase both at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention.'

'First responders should remain aware of the potential for spontaneous large crowds and protests that could overwhelm resources and should be vigilant for possible efforts to encourage peaceful protesters to commit acts of violence,' continued the warning.

It urged 'faith-based organizations to promptly report suspicious activities that could indicate pre-operational plotting against Jewish, Coptic, Islamic, or any other faith-based communities.'

It added that there was no information regarding any specific threats.
