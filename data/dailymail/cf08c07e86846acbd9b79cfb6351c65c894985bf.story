A coalition of Sydney artists have launched a campaign against a 'hopeless' Tony Abbott, by remixing an iconic political poster. 

The 4.5m tall billboard has been posted in Sydney's CBD, and is a re-imagining of the  'Hope' image that became famous during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.

However, as much as Shepard Fairey's iconic image helped usher a leader to power, Mr Agzarian's version hopes to show another leader the door.

Mr Agzarian told the Sydney Morning Herald he has become fed up with the current government, and labelled it as 'inept and uncaring'.

'This is a government that is leaving a lot of people behind,' Mr Agzarian said.

A poster designed by Michael Agzarian and the group 'Abbottsolutely' not, is placed on a billboard in Sydney.

The poster sums up public sentiment towards the Prime Minister, with just 25 per cent voters satisfied by his performance, according to Newspoll figures released this week.

Further, 77 per cent view Mr Abbott as 'arrogant', and the government continues to be behind Labor in two-party preferred polling figures.

A recent spill motion also sent shockwaves through the Prime Minister's leadership, with one third of his party room voting to boot him from office.  

Mr Agzarian said the current climate and contrast between Mr Abbbott and Mr Obama motivated him to put his own spin on the famous 'Hope' image.

'Obama gave people hope, whereas Abbott just makes us feel hopeless - and is pretty hopeless himself,' Mr Agzarian said.

The group plans to post more billboards across Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, in addition to 'hundreds of single sheet 700 x 1000 mm street posters' that will distributed across the Sydney CBD, and in the Prime Minister's electorate of Warringah.   

'We want more posters up around Sydney and across other major cities,' the group's website reads. 

Additional billboards will cost anywhere between $3500 and $35,190.

Mr Agzarian and his group have asked for public donations to ensure the posters are plastered across the country, and is accepting donations at its website, www.abbottsolutelynot.com. 

Street posters can also be purchased for $629 for 100, or $799 for 250.

Shepard Fairey's iconic image of Barack Obama, which served as the motivated for Mr Agzarian's poster.

'Obama gave people hope, whereas Abbott just makes us feel hopeless - and is pretty hopeless himself,' Mr Agzarian said.

The original 'Hope' poster was a central piece of Mr Obama's successful 2008 campaign, and has inspired a variety of other spin-offs in the years since its release.

The first hand-finished copy of the poster was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in 2009.

The 'Hopeless' poster will remain on Regent Street, Chippendale for the next four weeks.
