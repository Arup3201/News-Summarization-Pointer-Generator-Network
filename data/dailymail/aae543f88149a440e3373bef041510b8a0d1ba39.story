Diaw was supported by the efforts of Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard in particular.

Duncan finished with 19 points and 15 rebounds while Leonard contributed to 17 points for coach Gregg Popovich's side.

It will be the franchise's sixth trip
 to The NBA Finals under Popovich - who will be concerned by star point 
guard Tony Parker being unable to play the second half of their 
Chesapeake Energy Arena encounter due to a left ankle problem.

For Oklahoma it was again dynamic duo Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook who starred for them in defeat.

The pair combined for 65 points, 21 rebounds and and 14 turnovers as Westbrook led all scorers with 34 points.

Reggie Jackson added 21 points while Serge Ibaka finished with 16 and four defensive shot blocks.

Poor show: Derek Fisher (centre) scored all five of Oklahoma's points off the bench during their Game 6 defeat

For
 the hosts, their coach Scott Brooks will reflect on the game being lost
 due to the Spurs' far superior prolificy off the bench.

San Antonio's replacements scored 51 points in comparison to Oklahoma's five - which were all scored by Derek Fisher.

The 46-point differential in bench scoring is the largest in any game this season.
