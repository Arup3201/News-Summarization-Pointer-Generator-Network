Crumbling, barricaded and strewn with rubbish, these sporting venues cut a sorry sight just two years on from the Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

Once the focus of the world's attention, the sites now lie desolate - a stark reminder that hopes of a lasting legacy from international events can lie in tatters.

The Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, which lit up the 2010 Games with spectacular opening and closing ceremonies, has since been left decaying with overgrown plants, skeleton guard booths, growing wasteland, peeling paint and broken furniture.

Eyesore: Delhi's Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, which lit up the 2010 Commonwealth Games with spectacular opening and closing ceremonies, is now surrounded by rubbish

Uninviting: These gates and the unkempt land behind them don't give the appearance of a stadium well used

Wasted opportunity? The stadium usually seats 60,000 and is the third-largest multipurpose stadium in India

No-go area: The entrance to the Games village is now blocked by barriers and adorned with broken signs from the 2010 event

Rubbish! The Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, which was renovated especially for the Games at a cost of over £20million, looks more like a tip

Painful viewing: The Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium can seat 25,000 and is named after former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi

Littered: An area outside the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, which hosted the hockey at the Games

The stadium usually seats 60,000 people and is the third-largest multipurpose stadium in India.

But given the deluge of fiascos that hit the Games at the time, it perhaps isn't so surprising that it hasn't stood the test of time.

Embarrassing pictures leaked to the media in the run-up to the event showed filth and squalor at the athletes' village. A snake was later found in a South African competitor's room.

Stray dogs and monkeys became a menace and many top athletes pulled out over concerns about their safety.

Many were also left alarmed when a key pedestrian bridge close to the main stadium collapsed, while a giant scoreboard at the rugby sevens stadium also fell down.

Another photograph of the venues today shows the main road into the Commonwealth Games Village broken and unattractive.

Meanwhile,
 the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium was renovated especially for the 
Commonwealth Games in 2010 at a cost of over £20 million, but now it 
lays dirty, unkempt and crumbling.

The images may fuel fears for the future use of London's Olympic Park in Stratford after the 2012 Games.

The subsequent use of the Olympic Stadium
 has been dogged with controversy and legal wrangles amid battles for 
ownership after the Games.

Same fate? Critics of the London 2012 Games fear the money pumped into the Olympic Park in Stratford (above) will not provide the legacy organisers have promised

A lot at stake: In 2005, the predicted cost of London 2012 was £2.37billion, but it's currently set to come in over budget at £12billion or even £24billion

Last year, it emerged taxpayers face a
 bill running into tens of millions of pounds after a proposed deal to 
sell the venue to West Ham United collapsed.

Critics
 are yet to be convinced that the money injected into the area will go 
on to provide a legacy for East London as promised.

The predicted cost of the games when 
London won the bid in 2005 was £2.37billion, but it’s currently 
predicted to come in over budget at £12billion or even £24billion.

Earlier
 this week, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge 
expressed his belief that the London Olympics would leave a lasting 
impression.

'I am confident
 these Games will capture the spirit of this great cosmopolitan city,' 
he said. 'I am confident these Games will leave a lasting positive 
legacy for London.'

When the Sports Authority of India 
was contacted for a comment on the state of the Delhi venues, no-one 
would take responsibility for the upkeep of these stadiums.
