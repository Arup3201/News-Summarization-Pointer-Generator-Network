Liverpool and Middlesbrough would have needed to convert another 13 spot-kicks to break the world record for the highest-scoring penalty shootout on Tuesday night.

The shoot-out at the end of their Capital One Cup third round tie at Anfield was epic enough with its 27 goals and 30 penalties in total.

But it fell some way short of the highest-scoring shootout, which was Argentinos Juniors' 20-19 win over Racing Club in November 1988, back when all drawn matches in the Argentine League went to penalties.

And it was also nowhere near the record for the longest shootout, as recognised by the Guinness Book of Records, which was the 48 kicks taken by KK Palace and Civics in the 2005 Namibian Cup final.

Incredibly, 15 kicks were missed that day as KK Palace held their nerve to win 17-16.

The incredible events at Anfield did however eclipse the previous League Cup shootout record of 9-8, which has happened on three occasions: Arsenal vs Rotherham in 2004 and Manchester City vs Stoke City and Aston Villa vs Colchester United in 1982.

It equalled the record between two professional English clubs - the September 2011 Football League Trophy tie that ended Dagenham & Redbridge 14-13 Leyton Orient on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Arsenal beat Rotherham 9-8 on penalties back in 2003 in the previous joint League Cup record

The longest sequence of successful kicks scored in English football is 29, when Brockenhurst beat Andover Town 15-14 in a Hampshire Senior Cup tie in 2013. Andover's Claudio Herbert was the unfortunate one to miss in sudden death.

The FA Cup record was set in November 2001, when Macclesfield beat Forest Green Rovers 11-10.

Highest scoring shootouts at international level include the Netherlands' 13-12 win over England at the European Under-21 Championship in 2007 and the Ivory Coast's 12-11 victory against Cameroon in the 2006 African Nations Cup semi-finals.
