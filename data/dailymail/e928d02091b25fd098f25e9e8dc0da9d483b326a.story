A grandmother put the lives of train passengers on the line by getting stuck on a level crossing as the barriers came down, a court heard.

Susan Anderson, 55, escaped death when the train driver spotted her vehicle and was able to put the brakes on just in time.

The council worker reversed her Ford Fiesta off the line and got out of the way in Rackheath, near Norwich, last year.

Danger: Susan Anderson, 55, reverses her car out of the way as a train just avoids hitting her. The picture was taken from the train's cab which is just feet away from her vehicle

Anderson was not banned from driving but was instead fined just £400 when she appeared before magistrates yesterday.

Her car got stuck inside the half-barriers once the arms had gone down after she apparently ignored the red flashing light, the court was told.

But luckily for her, the train driver had good visibility as it was a long straight section of track and he was able to slow down just in time.

Anderson, who admitted careless driving, was given eight points on her licence along with the fine for going onto the line at around 8.30am on December 6 last year.

Jeremy Guy, mitigating, said that she was making no excuses for the incident.

Mr Guy said: 'She works for Norfolk County Council and it was a stressful time for her, as she had to reapply for her own job.

'She has kept her job and, in fact, has been promoted. She's clearly normally a good driver and has a clean driving licence after 27 years.'

He said Anderson was based in Norwich and needed to drive for work.

'Because of cutbacks, if she were banned from driving, it would impact on her colleagues,' stressed Mr Guy.

'She also has to drive to Thetford once a week to babysit for her daughter.'

Chairman of the bench, Paul Allen, warned Anderson: 'Potentially this could have been a very serious matter.

'But we are not going to disqualify you from driving.

'It must have been a frightening experience to find yourself the wrong side of the barrier with a train coming.'

As well as being fined £400 she was ordered to pay a £40 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

British Transport Police last night 
released a picture taken from the train cab of Anderson's Fiesta just 
after she had driven it off the line.

A BTP spokesman said: 'Incredibly some
people are still putting their lives on the line by ignoring warning 
lights and sirens and trying to dash through crossings when trains are 
approaching.

'This is completely irresponsible and dangerous and we will not hesitate to take action against anyone caught doing so.

'Working closely with Network Rail, we
hope to educate people of the potential dangers of crossing misuse to 
reduce such incidents.'

He said a high-tech police van, fitted
with nine cameras, had access to all the systems required to process 
prosecutions instantly, including automatic number plate recognition 
technology.
