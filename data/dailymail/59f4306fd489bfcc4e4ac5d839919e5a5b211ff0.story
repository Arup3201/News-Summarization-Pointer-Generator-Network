Tweet: Elisabeth Hasselbeck has made a comparison with the public's desire to hound the NFL with their apparent refusal to know the facts of Benghazi, in her opinion

Fox and Friends host Elisabeth Hasselbeck has compared the NFL's domestic violence scandals with the Obama administration's handling of the September 11, 2012 terror attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

Hasselbeck seemed to question why the nation's media was vociferously hounding the league and its commissioner, Roger Goodell for their handling of the Ray Rice and Adrian Paterson affairs, but ignored what Fox claims is a White House cover-up of the deadly attack two years ago.

Hasselbeck, 37, who was fired from The View, has split loyalties to both issues; her husband, Tim Hasselbeck is a former NFL quarterback, but Hasselbeck, who left 'The View' in 2013, celebrated her one year anniversary at Fox this week.

'Imagine if everone that asked for transparency in the NFL demanded that same transparency in our government,' wrote Hasselbeck.

The tweet, posted on Tuesday, was met with criticism by the Huffington Post, who mocked her for the comparison between two seemingly separate events that bear no comparison.

Hasselbeck responded by saying she had spoke to the mother of one of the four men killed during the attack which claimed the life of US Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.

'@HuffingtonPost We spoke w/the (sic) mom whose son was killed and men there that night. Inserting #Benghazi - is not ridiculous - IT IS AN #HONOR.'

Over the past two years, Fox News has been attacked for its level of coverage of the Benghazi affair and for repeatedly trying to claim the Obama administration was responsible for severe lapses in security, but tried to cover them up after.

Opinion: The Fox and Friends host made the point of transparency in reference to the continued attack on the Obama administration by Fox News

Counter: Huffington Post called her claim 'ridiculous' - so Hasselbeck answered back that the mother of one of the four dead Americans from Benghazi did not agree

A study by the group Media Matters claims that since 2012, Fox News' primetime news show has aired 1,098 pieces on Benghazi and 281 that allege a coverup by the White House.

Last week, Hasselbeck's Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade made a crass joke after they aired the sickening video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator.

Kilmeade quipped: 'I think the message is take the stairs.'

The remark led to giggles from his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report.

The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.'

Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.'

Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'.

The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release of the tape showing Rice punch his then fiancée Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator in February.

Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement.
