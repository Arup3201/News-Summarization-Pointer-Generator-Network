Relief etched on their face, these African immigrants say goodbye to their inflatable dinghy, and hello to the reassuring sturdiness of the a Coast Guard boat.

Spanish officials say Coast Guard vessels from southern Spain and Morocco have rescued 27 migrants on four inflatable dinghies in the Strait of Gibraltar in the last 24 hours.

Officials said some of the migrants trying to reach Spain from Morocco jumped into the sea when the two countries' rescue vessels approached them Monday.

They were desperate to be picked up by the closer Spanish boats that would take them to Europe - instead of back to North Africa.

Each year thousands of suspected illegal immigrants from Africa risk their lives trying to reach Europe on small, flimsy boats.

Spanish
 authorities said their vessels took 19 sub-Saharan men and two women to
 the port of Cadiz in southern Spain. Some were suffering from 
hypothermia.

Whether they will find a new home on this side of the Mediterranean is not known.

The six others were picked up by Moroccan rescuers and taken to Tangier.

It
 is believed that the men are all from sub-Saharan Africa and were on 
the final stages of an epic journey which saw them cross the desert on 
their way to the Moroccan coast.

The
 Strait of Gibraltar separates Spain and Morocco by around nine miles - a
 ferry ride between the two continents takes roughly 35 minutes.

Due to its location it is one of the key smuggling routes for illegal immigrants crossing into Europe.
