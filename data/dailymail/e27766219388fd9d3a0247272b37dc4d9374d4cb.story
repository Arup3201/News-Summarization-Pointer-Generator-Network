Social media users who declare support for charities may look good but they are less likely to hand over cash, according to a new report.

The token activists who do not dig into their pockets to give financial support have been dubbed 'slacktivists' by researchers.

'Charities incorrectly assume that 
connecting with people through social media always leads to more 
meaningful support,' said Sauder PhD student Kirk Kristofferson, of the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business.

Social media users who declare support for charities may look good but they are less likely to actually hand over cash, according to a new report. The more public the declaration, the less likely a person was to donate

'Our research shows that if people are able to declare support for a charity publicly in social media it can actually make them less likely to donate to the cause later on.'

Scientists say it is vital for charities to take note of the findings, which hint at a long-term loss of income

In a series of studies, researchers invited participants to engage in an initial act of free support for a cause - joining a Facebook group, accepting a poppy, pin or magnet or signing a petition.

Participants were then asked to donate money or volunteer.

They found that the more public the token show of endorsement, the less likely participants are to provide meaningful support later.

If participants were provided with the chance to express token support more privately, such as confidentially signing a petition, they were more likely to give later.

The researchers suggest this occurs because giving public endorsement satisfies the desire to look good to others, reducing the urgency to give later.

Providing token support in private leads people to perceive their values are aligned with the cause without the payoff of having people witness it.

With the holiday season being the biggest fundraising period of the year, the researchers say it is vital that charities take another look at their strategies and plan appropriately.

The study features in the forthcoming Journal of Consumer Research.
