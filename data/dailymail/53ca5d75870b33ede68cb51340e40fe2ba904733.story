Andrew Gale has been hit with a further ban and sent on an anger management course for abusing Ashwell Prince — but avoided a disciplinary hearing that could have branded him a racist.

The Yorkshire captain admitted ‘improper conduct’ in a compromise agreement with the ECB that sees him banned for the first two first-class matches of next season as well as the last two of this Championship-winning one.

Yet it could have been much more serious for Gale had he effectively stood trial after telling Lancashire’s Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country you Kolpak f*****’ during an ill-tempered Roses match last month.

Umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaughnessy reported Gale, who was responding to initial abuse from Prince, on a level two offence but it was upgraded by the ECB after they interviewed Prince and, significantly, his batting partner at the time, Australian Usman Khawaja.

Now, though, a deal has been reached with Gale, a serial offender for dissent, being punished for what were crass but surely not racist comments while the ECB have made it clear they believe the Yorkshire captain overstepped the mark.

Gale yesterday admitted in an ECB statement regret that his words ‘could have caused offence as a result of the reference to the nationality of the person to whom they were made’. He emphasised this was ‘absolutely’ not his intention.

In truth, the banning of Gale from receiving the Championship trophy during the presentation at Trent Bridge was punishment enough without what has become a four-match ban.

Even though yesterday’s statement did not categorically clear Gale of racism, he can resume his career next season without an indelible stain on his character.
