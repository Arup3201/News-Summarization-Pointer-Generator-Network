New year's parties are today being replaced by new year's resolutions, as Australians wake up with collective sore heads and tales to tell of a big night spent ushering in 2015.

The major capital cities quickly turned from party central to project clean-up.

In Sydney, council officials estimated the almost 350 workers have collected almost 50 tonnes of rubbish from across the harbour city, their New Year's Day spent tidying from the beaches into the CBD, at a cost of up to $400,000.

The morning after, Lord Mayor Clover Moore said: 'For me it was a little bit like when the Olympic Games was on.' And she paid particular tribute to cleaning staff.

'(They) started work straight after the fireworks, and as you can see the city is sparkling this morning,' she said.

More than 3000 officers were deployed across the city as it erupted into celebrations in a goodbye to 2014 and a welcome to 2015.

Thousands have headed to the beach early, to join those who never left, across major centres to escape the blast of summer. 

In Melbourne, hundreds of cleaning staff were deployed soon after the midnight fireworks, restoring the banks of the Yarra River to pristine condition.

Some Victorian revellers were still struggling to find a way home as light dawned on the new year, some choosing to sit it out in Federation Square before finding their way home.

Most Melburnians will spend the next day recovering ahead of heatwave conditions sweeping into the city and parts of the state on Friday through to Saturday, temperatures are expected to nudge 40 degrees celsius.

Heatwave conditions have already begun across South Australia, after more than 30,000 gathered in Adelaide for the NYE show.

The party atmosphere there will be sorely tested over the next three days, with the mercury in the mid-30s on the first day of 2015 and then the Bureau of Meteorology expecting at least 42 on Friday.

Brisbane's hot and steamy conditions did not deter party-goers. Up to 50,000 watched the fireworks display there.

The first day of 2015 is bringing a reprieve from the hot and humid conditions with a top of 30C, Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Michael Paech said.

'Just due to our generally onshore easterly flow in the winds through the morning and afterwards,' he said.

'It's more likely we'll see showers in the morning (on Thursday) and maybe lasting into the early afternoon.'

While, the shoreline party in Perth went off with little trouble but West Australians' thoughts are once again turning from revelry to preparation for hot conditions over the next three days which are expected to spark total fire bans once more.
