Axe: George Osborne is under pressure to scrap the 50p tax band introduced by Labour amid claims it makes no extra money

The controversial 50p tax band is 'not working' and revenues have fallen since it was introduced, new figures suggest.

They appear to show the wealthy are finding ways to dodge the tax band levied on incomes of more than £150,000.

In January, the tax take from those who 
do self-assessment tax returns collapsed by more than £500million, 
compared with the same month in 2011. They fell from £10.86billion to 
£10.35billion.

The figures have been 
eagerly awaited by George Osborne as they provide
the first evidence of the usefulness of the tax rate.

This is because January 31 was the 
deadline for all self-assessment forms to be filed for 2010-2011, the 
first full tax year since it was introduced.

The Centre for Economics and Business 
Reseach said it provided evidence that the 50p tax rate may be 
starting to hit receipts.

The figures will add to pressure on the Coalition to drop the levy amid fears it is forcing entrepreneurs to relocate abroad.

Separate figures, also published yesterday, provided more evidence that wealthy people are taking steps to avoid paying the tax.

Corporation tax was up 9.3 per cent on last January, but total income tax payments were up only 2.4 per cent - a surprisingly small amount.

This suggests in order to avoid the 50p band, many business executives decided to pay themselves a big bonus or dividend before it came into effect so they did not lose half their pay to the Inland Revenue.

Mike Warburton, senior tax partner at Grant Thornton, the accountants, said: ‘I had one client who took a £10million dividend before 50p tax came into force in April 2010.

‘He just said: "That will see me through until it is scrapped".'

Mr
Warburton said: 'My own view is that the tax raised by the 50p band is 
very questionable as to whether it actually raises any additional 
revenue.

'It is a big concern that it is putting off international business people from investing in this country.

'We need a big sign saying "Open for Business" above the UK but a 50p tax rate is exactly the reverse.'

The
tax has also been heavily criticised by the Institute of Directors, the
business lobby group, which said it is ‘totally unjustified’ and 
‘foolish’.

In April 
2010, it warned the next tax rate would raise ‘little or no tax’ despite
the Treasury’s insisted it would be worth up to £2.5billion a year.

As
the latest figures show, it warned there would be many ‘obvious tax 
planning opportunities’ with accountants also devising loopholes to 
avoid it.

Yesterday a 
Treasury source said the Chancellor has always made clear the 50p tax 
rate is ‘temporary’. HMRC is currently doing an assessment of how much 
revenue it actually raises.
