A boyfriend went out for a ride on his motorkbike to 'clear his head' after a row with his girlfriend  - and was killed in a horror smash.

Steel worker Gareth Davies, 27, jumped on his powerful Kawasaki ZX motorbike and sped off after falling out with his girlfriend.

An inquest heard how the last conversation he ever had with girlfriend Natalie Smith, 26, was an argument at a local pub.

Mr Davies lost control of his power bike and swerved into a parked car, suffering multiple injuries. He died at the scene.

He had been at the pub near his home in Aberdulais near Swansea, South Wales, when the row began.

Neath Port Talbot Coroners Court heard he was seen arguing with Ms Smith as they left the pub in April last year.

Mr Davies then stormed off and Ms Smith heard the sound of his motorbike speeding away into the night.

The court heard that Mr Davies lost control of the bike, began to wobble, causing him veer onto the opposite side of the road.

Neighbours in Cadoxton, South Wales heard a 'woosh and a bang' as he collided with a skip and then a parked black Seat Leon.

Collision investigator PC Gareth Davies said the collision had caused the Seat to move seven metres, with the handbrake on. The bike and car then caught fire.

He added: 'This tells me that it was a high speed impact.

'In my opinion, excessive speed is a contributory factor in this case. Gareth made an attempt to control it.

'It looks like he acted very quickly and tried to do something about it. This all happened very, very quickly.'

Assistant coroner Aled Griffith said: 'The accident was caused by Gareth losing control of his motorbike.

'It was a rash, spur of the moment decision, and it is very sad that this decision led to Gareth's death.

'This is a case where a young person has been cut down in his prime.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
