From the recently expanded family enclosure at Newcastle United, a dad and lad can watch the biggest names in all 19 Barclays Premier League games at St James’ Park for £417.

Granted, Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Alexis Sanchez and Diego Costa will not be playing in the black and white stripes of Newcastle, but they are among the star attractions at this sporting cathedral.

Newcastle’s family section has a capacity of 8,200 and is the biggest in the Premier League, possibly in Europe, too.

Newcastle supporters are in revolt but the club are trying things to attempt to win them back

Behind the scenes the staff are proud of their relationship with the thriving generation of the club's supporters.

A five-game package, starting this Saturday against Hull City and followed by Leicester, Liverpool, QPR and Chelsea, starts at £105 for adults, £25 for juniors. They are putting the fans first.

Sadly Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, has put newspaper groups and the reporters who work for them last, but we will come back to that.

This Saturday, when the team bottom of the Premier League take on Steve Bruce’s Hull, the atmosphere inside St James’ Park threatens to be venomous.

Everybody, it seems, is out for Ashley and his manager Alan Pardew.

All is not well, that much is clear after a 4-0 defeat at Southampton (where they were beaten by the same score last season) led to one banner proclaiming ‘Pardew is a Muppet’.

Since January 1, this team have won just five games in the Premier League (West Ham, Aston Villa, Hull, Crystal Palace and Cardiff). All of them were last season.

Over the weekend, when Ashley spoke with Pardew following their thumping at St Mary’s, the owner told him he would not be judged on the four league games they have played this season..

In any event there is a penalty clause in the eight-year contract Pardew signed in September 2012 and he will be entitled to £5m in compensation should Ashley decide to sack him. 

Some statistics on Ashley’s regime: in the accounts published in February, Newcastle’s wage bill is down to 64 per cent of turnover (down from 91 per cent when he took over in May 2007).

They paid £61.7m in salaries last season, falling into line with Financial Fair Play regulations.

Ashley cannot be faulted for prudence and he won’t blow his brains out paying super-sized salaries when the club doesn’t have the income to sustain them.

An interest-free loan from the owner of £129m is still showing on the financial statement for the 2012-13 season. It is the only significant debt at the club.

The days of PAs for the PAs are long gone in an era of financial restrictions and responsibilities at Newcastle.

Back to Pardew. There is a hangover from last season, when seven defeats in the last eight games in the Premier League set the tone.

After Yohan Cabaye, easily the club’s most influential player, was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £19m on January 29, the team jacked it in for the season.

Pardew’s shameful headbutt on David Meyler in March (leading to a £100,000 fine from the club, a formal warning and a touchline ban) affected his standing in the dressing room. Winning it back will not be easy.

The manager's frustrations in the transfer market this summer, missing out on Bafetimbi Gomis (now at Swansea) and Toby Alderweireld (Southampton), are the life of a manager. You win some, you lose some. 

So far a clutch of new signings - Darryl Janmaat, Remy Cabella, Emmanuel Riviere and Ayoze Perez - have shown little so far. Still, it is early days for all of them.

This is not a vintage Newcastle team by any stretch of the imagination, but new signings - particularly from overseas - deserve time to settle.

For every Angel di Maria there is a Florin Raducioiu. 

Mike Ashley has been criticised by Newcastle United fans but has been prudent with the club's finances

Much has been made of Pardew’s failure to take the team beyond the fourth round of either the FA Cup or League Cup since his arrival in December 2010.

Fair enough, but two years ago they played 14 matches in the Europa League before they were finally beaten by Benfica in the quarter-final. 

In isolation, 12th, fifth, 16th and 10th placed finishes in the Premier League doesn’t seem so bad.

In terms of expectations, Newcastle fans demand the very best from the team, just like every other group of supporters. That is no crime.

The manager is not popular, that much is clear with the various campaigns designed to unseat him from one of the most prestigious jobs in football. 

So what of Ashley? He’s taken to banning newspapers, which is a shame because he’s had bigger battles over the years than a few issues with the press.

‘Media froth’, as some communications directors at Premier League clubs have taken to calling the fascination with every day-to-day detail, is part of the game.

The sparkle is missing at St James’ Park, something Pardew is acutely aware of as he approaches this weekend’s clash with Hull.

After four years of fall-outs, the idea of a family get-together is a long way off.
