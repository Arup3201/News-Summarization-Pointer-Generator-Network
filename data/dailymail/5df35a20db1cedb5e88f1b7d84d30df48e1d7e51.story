It seems even birds aren't immune from marital squabbles.

This is the moment a female gives her male mate such a severe henpecking he appears to almost fall off his perch.

Quarrels between the sexes are common during the mating season and the birds' antics attract hoards of keen wildlife photographers to the Costa Rican jungle where they live.

Hen-pecking: A female gives her mate a good squawking-to in the Costa Rican jungle

The image was captured by photographer, birdwatcher and naturalist Csaba Godeny.

Mr Godeny, who is originally from Hungary, gives guided tours of the bird-watching hides in the jungle to tourists eager to brush up on their wildlife photography skills.

He said the picture, which captures a palm tanager and a Baltimore oriole, 'shows that even animal couples can bicker'.

Tanagers are medium-sized birds local to South and Central America. There are several different types of tanager, ranging from around 4ins to 11ins in length.

Most varieties are brightly coloured, although males tend to have more striking colouring than females.
