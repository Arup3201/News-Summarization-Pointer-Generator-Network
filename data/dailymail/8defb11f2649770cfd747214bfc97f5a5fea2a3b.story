Nasa has announced that it will be launching a mission in
2016 to lay the groundwork for asteroid mining- an activity that could add trillions of pounds to the world economy.

The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid Bennu
in 2018 with the aim of collecting cosmic samples to return to Earth.

Scientists hope the mission will accelerate technology that
will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals.

The shortage of sources for raw materials on Earth has
caused global inflation to spike in recent years causing tensions to rise
between nations, experts have said.

NASA scientists claim the high concentration of raw
materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals
like iron and platinum - could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural
resources.

Asteroids range in size
from a few yards to hundreds of miles across. Scientists believe that even a small, house-sized asteroid
should contain metals possibly worth millions of pounds.

Nasa's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid Bennu in 2018 with the aim of collecting cosmic samples to return to Earth. Scientists hope the mission will accelerate technology that will enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals

For instance, something called an ‘S-type’ asteroid could
contain significant amounts of metal including iron, nickel and cobalt, as well
as trace elements such as gold, platinum and rhodium.

‘A small, 10-meter S-type asteroid contains about 1,433,000
pounds (650,000 kg) of metal, with about 110 pounds (50 kg) in the form of rare
metals like platinum and gold,’ said Dante Lauretta of the University of
Arizona, Tucson, principal investigator for NASA's OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample
return mission.

7753 (1988 XB)           Profit      $1.38 trillion  

3200 Phaethon           Profit   £870 billion

The problem is it currently costs hundreds of millions and
sometimes billions of pounds to build and launch a space mission.

Another obstacle is the lack of experience in mapping and
analysing the resources in asteroids to extract material from them.

The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource
Identification, Security and Regolith Explorer) mission aims to gain this
experience.

The spacecraft, scheduled for launch in September 2016, will
arrive at the asteroid Bennu in October 2018 and study it in detail before
returning with a sample of material from its surface.

Its primary purpose is scientific - since asteroids are
relics from our solar system's formation, analysis of the sample is expected to
give insights into how the planets formed and life originated.

The spacecraft will also measure how the push from sunlight
alters the orbit of Bennu, to help understand the risk of asteroids impacting
Earth.

Nasa has designed triple redundancy into the mission- if the
first attempt fails, the team can try two more times to get at least 60 grams
of sample, and up to 2,000 grams.

‘The mission will be a proof-of-concept – can you go to an
asteroid, get material, and bring it back to Earth?’ said Mr Lauretta.

‘Next, people will have to industrialise it so that the
economy works out, so for the recoverable value in any given asteroid, you're
spending half that to bring it back.’

In addition to mining for platinum and other precious metals, both Nasa and other private ventures plans to tap asteroids' water to supply orbiting fuel depots, which could be used for robotic and human space missions

Last year a team of scientists, with the backing of Google
and Hollywood film maker James Cameron, unveiled plans for a private space
venture that would mine asteroids.

The company, called Planetary Resources, is initially focusing
on developing and selling extremely low-cost robotic spacecraft for surveying
missions.

Within five to 10 years, however, it expects to progress
from selling observation platforms in orbit around Earth to prospecting
services.

It plans to tap some of the thousands of asteroids that pass
relatively close to Earth and extract their raw materials. 

Not all missions would return precious metals and minerals
to Earth.

In addition to mining for platinum and other precious
metals, both Nasa and other private ventures plans to tap asteroids' water to
supply orbiting fuel depots, which could be used for robotic and human space
missions. 

One single asteroid in our solar system - 241 Germania - has $95.8 (£60) trillion of mineral wealth inside it - nearly the same as the annual GDP of the entire world.

This is according to Asterank, a website based on publicly available information that aims to catalogue the enormous wealth in the solar system, and also how little is currently known about what lies out there.

The site has based most of its estimates - graphing profitability against accessibility - on information from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Information on what is actually inside asteroids is much thinner on the ground - hence Planetary Resources aims to spend much of its early budget on scanners to work out what's out there.The site's charts weigh up how easy it is to get to an asteroid versus how much wealth there is there - often minerals such as platinum, but in the case of 241 Germanium, hydrocarbons such as oil.The site was founded by student Ian Webster, using publicly available data.
