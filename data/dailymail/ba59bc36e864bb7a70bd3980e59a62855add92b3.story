Nearly three-quarters of American adults who use the Internet have witnessed online harassment, while 40 per cent have experienced it themselves, according to a new first-of-its-kind report.

Young adults, aged 18 to 29, were the most likely age group to see and undergo online harassment. 

Women aged 18 to 24 were disproportionately the victims of stalking and sexual harassment, according to the survey by Pew Research Center.

The types of harassment Pew asked about range from name-calling to physical threats, sexual harassment and stalking. 

Half of those who were harassed said they didn't know the person who had most recently attacked them. 

When asked to describe their experience of harassment, respondents referred to social media in their answers.

'I was harassed and threatened through messages and comments on my Facebook page', one wrote.

'I had someone use Facebook to try to spread nasty rumors about me', another wrote. 

Although women were found to be the victim of stalking and sexual harassment more often, men were more likely to be called offensive names than women.

Of all Internet users (89 per cent of the U.S. population), 32 percent of men and 22 percent of women were called names. Men were also more likely to be physically threatened.

People who have more information available about them online, and those who work in the tech industry and promote themselves online, were also more likely to be harassed on the Internet.

Thirty-eight percent of people who were harassed online said a stranger was behind the threats, and another 26 percent didn't know who the person was.

Two-thirds of those who were harassed said the most recent incident took place on a social networking site or app, while 22 percent saw it happen in the comments section of a website. 

Meanwhile, 16 per cent said it happened in online gaming.

Just five per cent of those who were harassed reported the incident to law enforcement, while nearly half confronted the person online. 

Just under half (44 per cent)  said they un-friended or blocked the person.

Not everyone said they were hurt by online harassment but 14 per cent of people found their most recent incident 'extremely upsetting,' and 22 percent said it was 'not at all upsetting.' 

The rest of the people surveyed had reactions in between.

The telephone and online survey was conducted between May 30 and June 30 2014 among 3,217 respondents. 

It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.
