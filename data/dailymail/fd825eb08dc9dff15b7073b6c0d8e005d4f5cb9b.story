If twerking, PVC and too much tongue didn't help Miley Cyrus complete her controversial transition from cutesy Disney star to bona fide fashion name, her new tour costumes most certainly will.

A-list designer Roberto Cavalli has unveiled sketches of the costumes he's created for Miley's upcoming Bangerz tour - prepare for barely-there bras, smatterings of glitter and denim hot pants galore.

Cavalli, who is loved by the Beckhams and has previously created tour costumes for Beyoncé, Cheryl Cole and the Spice Girls, is one of five designers creating looks for the 21-year-old.

The 73-year-old Italian designer's offerings are loud, sparkly and revealing - just the way Miley likes it.

Key pieces include sparkly denim hot pants and leopard-print shorts, which come complete with a matching bralets, of course.

More sophisticated styles include a crystal-embellished jumpsuit, as well as a
shimmering dark zebra print all-in-one.

Marc Jacobs, Jeremy Scott, The Blonds and Bob Mackie all also designing pieces for her Bangerz world tour wardrobe.

Miley will kick off her Bangerz tour on February 14 in Vancouver.

She recently dropped a few hints about the 90-minute show, telling MTV: 'Our whole tour is literally based on animals.'

Ren & Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi has designed 'imaginative animals 'for the show.

She's also promised to provide her fans with some unique collectibles from the gigs.

A taste of what's to come? Miley made the 'twerk' infamous as she performed with Robin Thicke at the MTV VMAs

'I'm
 a little bit of a hoarder, so I hope my fans become hoarders,' she told
 the website.

'I want to give them real things to collect. I'll have 
things falling out of the sky that most people would sell at the merch 
table.

'This is my mom's 
worst nightmare, because I always hoard things from when I go to 
concerts ... all the kids always want to keep the confetti, but I want 
to give them real things to collect.'

Riding high: Miley has made tiny tops and barely-there pants her own in her transformation from tween star to fully fledged fashionista
