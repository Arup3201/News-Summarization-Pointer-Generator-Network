Grant Cameron, 25, was the first to return to the UK after being released but the others are now back home in Britain

Three British men convicted on drugs charges earlier this year in Dubai are back in the UK today after being pardoned in during a Ramadan amnesty, according to diplomatic sources.

Suneet Jeerh, 25, Grant Cameron, also 25, and Karl Williams, 26, were arrested last July while on holiday in the Gulf state after synthetic cannabis, known as ‘spice’, was found in their car.

The trio, who were each jailed for four years in April for possessing drugs, all denied the charges.

Prime Minister David Cameron raised the case with Emirati president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan in May and talks have been continuing through other official channels.

Reprieve, a charity which represents 
people in foreign jails, said the three men are now all home in the UK.

The three men, all from east London, are believed to have 
been released under a legal device which permits the Emirate to free 
criminals during the holy month of Ramadan on humanitarian grounds.

There had been calls for the UAE to consider speedy pardons amid claims that all three were abused by police.

The men claimed they signed documents
in Arabic - a language none of them understands - following their 
arrests after they were threatened with guns to their heads.

Williams also reported having electric shocks administered to his testicles. The police deny the claims.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
spokesman said: 'We are aware that the 2013 amnesty list has been 
announced in the United Arab Emirates and that the local authorities 
have begun the process of releasing those included. This will continue 
to come as welcome news for those included and their families.

'It would not be appropriate to discuss details of specific cases. 
Questions about next steps are best answered by the UAE authorities. We 
will continue to provide appropriate consular assistance.

'We understand that if there is deportation involved, British nationals will be deported back to the UK.'

Reprieve investigator Kate Higham 
said: 'The release of Grant, Karl and Suneet is welcome, but long 
overdue. They were treated appallingly by Dubai police, who still have 
serious questions to answer.

'We are glad that they are all now safely back in the UK, but the UAE's terrible record on torture must not be forgotten.'

Grant Cameron's mother Tracy Cameron 
said: 'After a year of waiting, we are deeply relieved and overjoyed to 
have Grant back home with us after his terrible ordeal.

'Obviously what Grant has been 
through has been very distressing for him, and the family as a whole. 
We'd ask that people give him the time, space and privacy he needs to 
settle back in.'
