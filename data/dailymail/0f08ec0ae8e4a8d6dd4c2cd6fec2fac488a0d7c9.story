London 2012 poster girl Sarah Storey took Britain's first gold medal in the  Velodrome yesterday, kick-starting the home team's Paralympic medal rush.

Such was the superiority of the 34-year-old that she actually caught and overtook her opponent, Anna Harkowska of Poland, despite starting on the other side of the track to her.

Although the Women's Individual C5 Pursuit should have  been over 12, 250metre laps – 3,000metres in total – Storey caught the Pole on just the seventh, instantly ending the race.

Her heat time yesterday – three 
minutes and 32.170 seconds – was quicker than Olympic medallist Joanna 
Rowsell's Track World Cup win on the same track in February.

Even more remarkably, Storey only 
narrowly missed out on an Olympic place in the team pursuit squad, where
Laura Trott, Dani King and Jo Rowsell romped to gold in world-record 
times.

Yesterday's triumph makes her one of 
Britain's greatest-ever paralympians, giving her 19 Paralympic medals 
in total – including eight golds across six Games – in two different 
sports.

Her first five gold, eight silver and three bronze medals were 
won at swimming before she switched to cycling after picking up a severe
ear infection in the pool.

She then won two more golds four years ago at Beijing.

And with three more cycling events to 
come over the next week, Storey is on track to take her tally to 11 
golds – equalling the women's record collected by Baroness 
Grey-Thompson.

A total of 22 medals by the end of next week would also replicate the record Olympic haul of US swimmer Michael Phelps.

She said yesterday: 'It is fantastic, a
great feeling. I didn't expect to be able to catch her as quickly. I 
suppose it did look easy but mentally you have to prepare and make it 
happen. I have to respect all my competitors.'

Asked what she was thinking as she 
chased down her opponent, Storey – who was born without a left hand – 
said: 'Just, “gotta get there quick, quick, quick!”

'I was like, “It's not gonna be this 
lap, maybe the next lap... You're just willing the rider to come to you 
quickly so you can finish.'

Earlier in the day, she had cemented 
her place in British  Paralympic history by breaking the world record – 
and her own  72nd world record.

Reflecting on her victory, Storey 
added: 'I said if I could get off to a great start that would set me up 
for the rest of the week and hopefully that's the case. The first one's 
always the hardest to get out of the way.'

Among those celebrating loudest were 
her parents John and Mary Bailey, who wore T-shirts listing every gold 
medal their daughter had ever won across swimming and cycling, as well 
as being 'the under 14s Cheshire table tennis champion'.

The crowd went wild when they realised that Storey was on her way to win gold

Mr Bailey, a retired engineer, said: 'It was marvellous. She knocked the spots off them.

'If you are going to win then that is 
the way to do it – job done. And I suppose it meant she could save her 
energy for her other races.'

Storey's husband Barney, who broke off
from his own training as a tandem partner to a blind cyclist, said: 'It
was amazing. I was nervous but she was brilliant.'

Miss Storey, who first competed as a 
paralympian as a 14 year-old in Barcelona in 1992, said: 'In the womb my
arm was caught in the umbilical cord and didn't develop as it should 
have.

'My left arm ends at the heel of my palm. But it did not stop me playing sport as a child. I carried on as normal.

'I've never been treated differently and that's a major part in my life. I've just got on with it.'
