More potential victims of the cop who allegedly brutally beat a great grandmother on the side of the road have come forward, MailOnline can reveal.

A number of people have contacted pressure group Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable since sickening footage of Marlene Pinnock being repeatedly punched in the head by a Highway Patrol officer went viral.

The new witnesses say they recognize the cop from the video as someone they have had aggressive run-ins with in the past.

At this stage the claims are unsubstantiated, but sources at LAUPR are determined to thoroughly investigate them in an attempt to determine whether the policeman in question has a history of violence. There has been no suggestion that this is the case up to this point.

According to the LA Times, the officer in question has been placed on an 'administrative assignment' out of the field following the attack on Mrs Pinnock, 51, which took place on the side of an LA highway a week ago.

But news he is on full pay, and the California Highway Patrol's refusal to publicly name him has infuriated Mrs Pinnock's family and civil rights campaigners.

And if the claims that he has a history of aggressive behavior prove correct, the anger is likely to grow even stronger.

A LAUPR source told MailOnline: 'We have received emails from people who say they recognize the policeman from the video.

'They have said they have been stopped by him in the past and he was very aggressive towards them. Obviously these claims are unsubstantiated at the moment, but we would be foolish not to check them out.

'At
 this stage it is impossible to say whether they are valid or not. For 
all we know this officer could have an exemplary service record up to 
this point.

'But if they are legitimate it will raise some incredibly tough questions for the California Highway Patrol.
 This is why we need to know the identity of the officer in question. We
 need to be able to check his record to see if he has a history of this 
kind of behavior. His identity should be a matter of public record.'

Attack: Motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer straddle a woman while punching her in the head on the Interstate 10 in Los Angeles

Attack: On July 1, motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer punching a woman in the head and shoulder after she'd walked barefoot along the Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles

Attack: Several people have claimed they recognize the California Highway Patrol officer in the footage of the July 1 assault because they'd also had run-ins with him

Mrs Pinnock had been walking barefoot on eastbound Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles  before she was tackled to the ground by the officer.

A passing driver videotaped the incident showing the CHP trooper pinning her down and repeatedly punching her in the face.

The victim's family have hired Los Angeles attorney Caree Harper to represent them in the case against the California Highway Patrol.

Harper said her clients want the authorities held accountable for 'beating a great-grandmother in broad daylight.'

Mrs Pinnock has been named locally, but the lawyer declined to identify her or answer questions about what she was doing along the edge of one of the city's busiest freeways.

'We want the focus to be what he was doing to her, not what she was doing' prior to the confrontation, said Harper.

'She was getting beat like an animal. No one should ever be beat like that.'

Speaking on Saturday Mrs Pinnock’s daughter Mayisha Allums told KTLA: 'He punched and pound and pound on her, the only thing she could do was block her face.’

As of Monday Mrs Pinnock was in an undisclosed hospital where she was undergoing a mental health evaluation.

The California Highway Patrol has vowed to carry out a thorough investigation - but authorities claimed the trooper in question simply stopped her for her own protection.

CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn said at a news conference that the woman was endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was forced to restrain her.

O'Quinn added that the woman had begun walking off the freeway but returned when the confrontation occurred.

Passing motorist David Diaz recorded the uniformed officer as he jabbed Mrs Pinnock at least 11 times in the head Tuesday.

'The most animalistic, most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head,' Diaz told ABC7.

'There was no weapons - it's obviously excess force,' he continued.

'He starts really letting loose... He starts pounding down on her face really hard. He doesn't try to grab her hands first.'

On Monday Los Angeles civil rights activists met with California Highway Patrol Asst. Commissioner Ramona Prieto to discuss the incident.

The Rev. William D. Smart Jr., head of the Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Alliance, attended the meeting and he told The LA Times he is 'enraged' by the video.

He added: ‘We’re very angry. Our community is highly upset over this - that a black woman was being hit that way, treated that way. There’s a rage in our community right now.'

A second meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. Lawyers and campaigners will make a string of demands of the CHP.

Most importantly, they will insist that the officer in question is names immediately, so checks can be made into his background.

They will also call for a quick and thorough investigation and a review and revamp of officer training with the aim of avoiding any similar, brutal incidents in future.
