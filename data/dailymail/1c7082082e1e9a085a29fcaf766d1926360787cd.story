Simpsons producer Al Jean has more or less confirmed that Krusty the Clown will be killed off on the show’s September 29 season premiere.

There has been speculation for months about just who will get the chop after Jean revealed during a publicity tour last year that a major character would be written out of the show.

At the time he said: ‘'I'll give you a clue that the actor playing the character won an Emmy for playing that character, but I won't say who it is.’

No more clowning around: It seems that Krusty will make his last appearance on The Simpsons in September

It wasn’t much of a clue considering that almost all of the actors who supplied voices for the main Simpsons characters have taken home Emmys.

But at a Television Critics Association panel on Sunday on Fox, Jean all but confirmed that the caustic clown is the character that’s in the writers’ cross-hairs.

He said that the episode in which the character died would be called A Clown In The Dumps, which drew gasps from the audience.

There is, however, a chance that the character being axed is Krusty’s father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, voiced by Jackie Mason, or Sideshow Bob, voiced by Kelsey Grammer, as they have both won Grammys for their voice work.

He added: ‘It’s a terrific character and it [happens in] our premiere this coming year.'

Dan Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, told the Archive of American Television that the character is a chance for the writers to 'take shots at comedians or TV shows they've written for, so they can put it all into Krusty'.

Even though he presents a kiddy show, Castellaneta said, 'he's been compared to Jackie Gleason... the old time comics, who've got to have everything done just right, but also steeped in Jewish showbusiness'.

He added: 'For a while they tried to do Krusty out of his make-up, but then they said "just leave him in make-up all of the time".

The original idea, he said, was that 'Bart idolised Krusty and Matt [Groening] designed him to look like Homer and he was going to do something where it turned out that Homer really was Krusty and he abandoned that very quickly'.

Castellanesta explained that the idea is that 'Bart subconsciously idolises Homer, but he can't really, so he does it through this kiddy show host'.

The season, which premieres in the U.S. in September, is the show's 26th. In 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest running primetime television show. Since its debut in 1989 it has broadcast 552 episodes.

Following Jean's announcement about the title of the first episode of the new season, bookmaker Paddy Power slashed the odds of Krusty the Clown being axed from 14/1 to just 3/1.

Paddy Power has Sideshow Bob as favourite to kill Krusty, with odds of 7/2 that he'll do the deed.

As to how Krusty goes, Paddy Power has priced up a few possibilities, with the outsider option being death by doughnut at 33/1 - and dying while saving Bart's life the most likely at 3/1. 

A circus accident gets odds of 5/1, crushed by a piano 8/1, frightened to death 12/1 and being run over by Homer 12/1.
