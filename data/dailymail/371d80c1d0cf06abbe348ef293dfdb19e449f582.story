Star sing-along: Wayne Rooney took part in an extraordinary duet with his idol Ed Sheeran in Manchester last week

Wayne Rooney became a pub crooner after agreeing to a duet with superstar Ed Sheeran during a late-night drinking session, new footage revealed today.

The England and Manchester United captain was filmed as he warbled his way through Sheeran's hit Lego House during a sing-along after the musician's sell-out gig in Manchester last week.

He joined Ed for drinks at the Sir Ralph Abercromby pub but when Ed pulled out his guitar Rooney was keen to sing with him.

The millionaire footballer sat on a stool with a pint of lager on the table next to him, and at times closed his eyes and clasped his hands together as he sang one of his favourite songs. 

The crowd joined in although at times those watching could be heard giggling as Rooney struggled to hit some of the notes.

Wayne, 29, later documented their late night drinks by sharing a fun post-show snap with his 10.1 million Twitter followers. 

The Manchester United forward is known for his love of music and has the title of the Stereophonics' album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm.

One person who saw Rooney sing last week told The Sun: 'Everyone was singing along and laughing but he showed he can take a joke.

'It was like a normal group of mates messing about in a pub but I'd definitely advise him not give up the day job.'

Pub landlord Mike Christodoulou said: 'Ed pulled out his guitar and him and Wayne had a little sing song — it was good vibes all round.'

And this is not the footballer's first gig, having been filmed doing karaoke in the past.

In 2011 he did a seven song set while on holiday with his wife and children in Barbados. 

He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests.

He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'. 

But Wayne has also suffered from stage fright, having admitted in the past he didn't sing the national anthem at football games because he never learned the words.

The star was criticised for being unpatriotic because he did not sing a single word of 'God Save The Queen' when lining up for his country,  but explained he was never taught the song.

After his duet with Sheeran the footballer tweeted: ‘Brilliant time at @edsheeran concert last night. Thanks for a great night mate.’

Sheeran has become a Premier League phenomenon.

Top referee Mark Clattenburg was dropped from the top flight's list of officials at the weekend after breaking protocol and travelling to see him in concert in Newcastle straight after a game.

The referee drove alone to take charge of West Brom's home game against Crystal Palace on October 25 - a move engineered in order to see the award winner perform at the Metro Radio Arena. 

Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has also seen Sheeran perform recently.

Meanwhile Ed, 23, updated his own account with a shot of the audience taken from his stage vantage point with the message: ‘Manchester #1.’ 

His own life has been transformed by his success, going from being homeless to earning wages on a par with top footballers. 

Although his friend Wayne Rooney earns £300,000 a week, Sheeran's music is said to bring in around £85,000 a week for him.

The Suffolk boy made £4.5million in 2013 according the Companies House and his highly-rated album X is the biggest seller of the year. 

Rooney’s appearance at Sheeran's gig came days before her played in the Manchester derby where his side lost 1-0 to rivals City. 

Rooney, who celebrated his 29th birthday days earlier on October 24, had remained in Manchester while wife Coleen and their two sons, Kai, two, and 17-month old Klay, enjoy a half-term break in Barbados.

The WAG has been sunning herself on the West Indian isle, where the Rooney’s own a holiday home, on what amounts to her 10th overseas holiday in a year.
