People are more likely to commit suicide at night than during the day, new research has revealed.

Far more suicides occur between midnight and 4am than during the daytime or evening, the study found.

The researchers believe this could be because some suicides are trigger by insomnia and by nightmares.

People are most likely to commit suicide between the hours of midnight and 4am, a new study shows

The researchers, at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, found the average suicide rate per hour was 10 per cent after midnight, peaking at 16 per cent between 2am and 2.59am.

In contrast, the average suicide rate per hour was two per cent between 6am and 11.59pm.

When six-hour time blocks were examined, the observed frequency of suicide between midnight and 5.59am was 3.6 times higher than expected.

‘These results suggest that not only are nightmares and insomnia significant risk factors for suicidal [thoughts] and behaviour, but just being awake at night may itself be a risk factor for suicide,' said  principal investigator Dr Michael Perlis at the University of Pennsylvania.

According to the authors, previous research suggesting that more suicides occur during the day failed to account for the proportion of the population that is awake at each given hour - something that was taken into account for this study.

It is thought insomnia and nightmares could play a role in prompting suicides at night

The current study involved archival analyses of both the National Violent Death Reporting System, which provided data for the estimated time of fatal injury, and the American Time Use Survey, which provided an hourly proportion of the U.S. population that is awake. 

A total of 35,332 suicides were included in the analysis.

According to Dr Perlis, an important implication of the study is that the treatment of insomnia may be one way to reduce suicide risk.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine reports that about 10 per cent of adults have a chronic insomnia disorder lasting at least three months.

Accounting for more than 38,000 deaths each year, suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In comparison, about 16,000 deaths occur each year due to homicide.

Aside from insomnia and nightmares prompting some suicides, simply being awake at night may be a risk factor, say U.S. researchers
