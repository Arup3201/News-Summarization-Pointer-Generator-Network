Cyprus has been warned it must sell its excess gold reserves to raise 400million euros needed to help finance its EU bailout.

The stark assessment by the European Commission will come as another huge blow for the tiny country as it battles to save its stricken economy.

One of the euro zone's smallest economies, Cyprus has already been forced to wind down one of its largest banks and slapped losses on uninsured deposits in order to qualify for a 10billion euro lifeline from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

Desperate: Widespread protests have been held across Cyprus as fears rise over the impact of the crisis. The country has now been told it must sell its excess gold reserves to help fund its bailout

Worried: Cypriots have queued to withdraw money from the country's banks since the financial crisis hit - including at this Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia

The European Commission's draft assessment set 
out plans for the sale of some 10 tonnes of gold, the biggest euro zone bullion 
sale in four years.

The assessment also said that Cyprus would raise 10.6 billion euros from the winding down of Laiki Bank and the losses imposed on junior bondholders and the deposit-for-equity swap for uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus.

Nicosia would get a further 600 million euros over three years from higher corporate income taxes and a rise in the capital gains tax rate.

Fears: Depositors waiting to withdraw money from a branch of Laiki Bank in Nicosia, last month. Laiki, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, was wound up as part of the bailout deal agreed with the EU

Of the total Cypriot financing needs of 
23 billion euros between the second quarter of 2013 and the first 
quarter of 2016, the euro zone bailout fund will provide nine billion 
euros, the International Monetary Fund one billion euros and Cyprus itself
will generate 13 billion euros, the assessment said.

Cyprus's total bullion reserves stood at 13.9 tonnes at the end of February, according to data from the World Gold Council.

The analysis from the EU and IMF predicts the Cypriot economy will contract by 8.7 percent this year, following the bailout designed to put Cyprus back on a stable financial footing.

It also shows that the economy will go on contracting through 2014, returning to marginal growth of 1.1 per cent in 2015. At the same time, debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) will peak at 126 percent, before falling to 104 per cent in 2020, the debt sustainability report shows.

The analysis forecasts the budget deficit to be six per cent of GDP this year, 7.9 per cent next year, 5.7 per cent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016.

The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone bailout fund, also said in a proposal that the maximum average maturity of euro zone bailout loans to Cyprus will be 15 years and the longest maturity will be 20 years.

Cyprus will be charged a 10-basis-point margin above financing costs for the loans, plus a 50 basis point up-front fee for every disbursement, said the proposal, which will be discussed on Friday by finance ministers of European Union countries at a meeting in Dublin.

The ESM document bears the date of April 23, 2013, indicating that this will be the date when the euro zone is likely to formally sign the bailout agreement with Cyprus.
