Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand songs.

The supersized book 108 Rock Star Guitars (Glitterati Inc.) demonstrates that six-stringed instruments owned by celebrities and virtuoso sidemen can look as good as they rock.

The 17-year undertaking by photographer Lisa S. Johnson partly benefits the Les Paul Foundation. Paul, the Rock Hall musician-inventor, wrote the foreword before he died.

Not a guitar geek? Don't fret.

Battle scars: This photo by Lisa S. Johnson shows Willie Nelson's guitar, named Trigger. The instrument has a hole worn through it, and is inscribed with dozens of autographs

Patched together: This guitar, owned by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls, was a resurrected broken Stratocaster. He turned it into a four-string, named Halfcaster, and used it on a song called Big Machine

Whether you define 'pickup' as a truck, a dating technique or a guitar part, you can revel in the glitz-and-grit world where these prized possessions reside.

The instruments (one's named Baby) evoke tender talk from macho musicians. But some of these battle-ax beauties have seen more action than a roller derby queen: They bear the gashes and sweat stains to prove it.

The author, who grew up in a musical family, underscores musicians' emotional attachment to their instruments.

'I don't believe any serious musician feels that his instrument is an inanimate object,' Tom Scholz of the group Boston tells Johnson.

Full of character: This double-neck guitar named Uncle Dick, is owned by Rick Nielsen of the group Cheap Trick

Steve Vai, who went solo after playing with Frank Zappa's band, once described his guitar as 'the voice of my heart' in moments of depression, euphoria and 'divine love. ... I have cried, screamed, prayed and bled through that instrument.'

The book lauds the instrument-makers, called luthiers, and the techs, along with the guitars.

 wallflowers blossom into unbridled stardom. There are kaleidoscopic, 
patriotic and wildcat patterns; gorgeous maple and mahogany; delicate 
carvings of leaves and acorns; a stuck-on Chinese cookie fortune; python
 skin; fake fur; little-girl superheroes.

Some seem to revel in musical masochism:

- Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne Band) - blowtorch burns, hammered-on bottle caps.

-
 Slash (Velvet Revolver, Guns N' Roses) - cigarette carelessness. As the
 story goes, the guitarist was 'one with the music' while accidentally 
inflicting a 'charred reminder of rock `n' roll nirvana.'

 Rzeznik (Goo Goo Dolls) resurrected a broken Stratocaster into a 
4-string. The word 'OUCH!' is splayed over its torso; it's now named 
Halfcaster.

Elaborate: A guitar owned by James J.Y. Young of the group Styx. The instrument bears a carving of Cerberus, ancient mythology's three-headed Underworld guard dog

Telling a story: This guitar, owned by activist-musician Tom Morello, has scrawled jarring jargon over drawings of happy hippos

'I was amazed when I threw the guitar 
in the air and the top portion split right off,' Rzeznik recalled via 
email. 'I had my guitar tech take it to a luthier in LA who sanded off 
the rough edges and fixed the electronics.

'I
 used it on a song called Big Machine for a couple years after that. 
Surprisingly, the tone didn't really change; it was a cheap guitar that 
didn't sound that great to begin with. Haha!'

The appreciation of instruments as visual art is an age-old concept.

They
 'may evoke status, identity, or indicate events - sacred or profane,' 
comments J. Kenneth Moore, the Frederick P. Rose curator in charge of 
the Department of Musical Instruments at The Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York City. 'They become sounding, tangible works of art - telling
 many stories of the life and times of those who used them,' he said.

Maturing together: Country music legend Willie Nelson performs at the 20th anniversary Farm Aid concert in Tinley Park, Ill. on September 18, 2005, with his famous guitar Trigger

A double-neck owned by Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen has a quirky folk art feel. Its two-pronged top forms the legs of Nielsen's upside-down caricature. The figure, named Uncle Dick, displays a thumbs-up, but his expression looks maniacal.

When Mom made young Nils Lofgren a Nehru jacket and bell-bottom pants out of drapes, he proudly stuck leftover fabric on his guitar so it matched his new suit.

The book also features a famous, battered Fender Esquire owned by Lofgren's boss, Bruce Springsteen.

'Willie Nelson and Trigger continue to mature together'

Before a Rage Against the Machine performance, Tom Morello scrawled 'Arm the Homeless' on his guitar.

The jarring jargon co-exists with Morello's drawings of happy hippos. Like most art, it invites interpretation. In Johnson's view, he's contrasting the have-nots and the haves (rotund creatures 'gobbling their food').

Willie Nelson's Trigger, named for movie-cowboy Roy Rogers' horse, bears dozens of autographs, including Leon Russell, Roger Miller, Kris Kristofferson, Gene Autry, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. Trigger's top is worn clear through; Nelson chooses to leave it that way.

'The two of them,' notes the book, 'continue to mature together.'

Life partners in perfect harmony.
