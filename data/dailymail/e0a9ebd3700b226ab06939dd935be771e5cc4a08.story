Morgan, who played all of his career in Norway, had been on a night out with his team-mates on Saturday but his body was later discovered in a local river.

An investigation is now under way to determine the cause of his death, although local police say it is not being treated as suspicious.

Cardiff midfielder Mats Moller Daehli was a one-time team-mate of Morgan and wrote on Instagram: 'A truly great guy is gone. It was an honour to be your team-mate and to play alongside you.'
