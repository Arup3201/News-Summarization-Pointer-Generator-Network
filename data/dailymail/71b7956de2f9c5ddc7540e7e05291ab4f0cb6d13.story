A grieving mother whose fiancé was killed in a road crash has started dating his doppelganger - after they met on an online dating site.

Naz Faruk, from Wokingham, Berkshire, was pregnant when her partner Mark Ashdown, died in a motorbike accident last July.

The devastated 28-year-old gave birth to their daughter, Sia, in February, but just months later met a man who looked strikingly similar to her late fiancé.

After Mr Ashdown's death, Ms Faruk doubted she would meet the man of her dreams again.

But just weeks after giving birth, she started talking to 23-year-old Michael Miller on an online dating site - and could not believe the similarities.

She said: 'It was so crazy, I felt as thought I was talking to Mark but it was Michael.

'Nothing will ever replace Mark but it was surreal to meet another person so like him.

'It took two months of talking online before me and Michael met but we hit it off straight away.

'Mark was caring and was emotional and I found that Michael was exactly the same.

'Michael is over 6ft tall with long golden brown hair and blue eyes - just like Mark. Mark also enjoyed playing the guitar as does Michael, the list is endless.

Mr Ashdown (pictured with his fiancée Naz Faruk) died when he was involved in a motorbike accident at a crossroads. His parents had to deliver the devastating news to Ms Faruk after she rang his mobile.

'People are always making comparisons to Michael and Mark. I just feel so lucky to have found someone who understands me like my fiancé did. I never thought I'd fall in love again.'

She said: 'I called Mark as I wondered why I hadn't heard from him all afternoon.

'I fell to my knees when they told me he had died, I couldn't take it all in.

'He was too young to die, we had our whole lives to look forward too, it was so cruel.

'Apparently he had misjudged some changing traffic lights when he hit into another car.

'It was the biggest shock, I had never gone through everything like this in my life. I thought we would grow old together.

'I was petrified I would lose the baby too - the only piece of Mark left with me.'

Thankfully, Ms Faruk had a smooth pregnancy and baby Sia has helped her through the trauma of losing her fiancé. 

'I never imagined we were soon to become a family of three again,' she said.

Ms Faruk met Mr Miller earlier this year and they have been inseparable since the day they met up.

She added: 'Michael gets on so well with Sia, he loves her like she's his own daughter.

'I'll always make sure Sia knows who her daddy, Mark, was and how much he meant to us.

'I've got a drawer full of his clothes and memories we shared that I will show Sia when she grows up.'

After a tough year, Ms Faruk is finally looking forward to the future and revealed her new relationship has made her happy again.

'I can't believe I have got through it all.  

'I'm just to lucky to have met Michael, who is so similar, not only in looks, but in personality too.'
