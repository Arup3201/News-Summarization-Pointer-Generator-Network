Nigel Farage will announce within weeks which constituency he will stand in at the next election.

The Ukip leader says he has not yet chosen which parliamentary seat he will target in his attempt to become the first person in his party elected to the Commons, but that it would ‘more than likely’ be in Kent.

It had been widely expected that Mr Farage would stand in Thanet South, but his plans were dealt a blow at the weekend when the Tories selected a former Ukip leader to stand there.

Plans: Nigel Farage (pictured in the European Parliament) will be standing for a Westminster seat next year

Last night he told radio station LBC that he still might stand against Craig Mackinlay, one of the founding members of Ukip, who has defected to the Conservatives.

‘I’m not interested in who stands for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party. Thanet South is a three-way marginal,’ he insisted.

‘The last raw data we had from opinion polls put the parties within 2 per cent of each other. Ukip will fight Thanet South to win.

'Just give me another couple of weeks... The European Parliament goes into recess on July 24, I will announce within a couple of weeks of that where I will stand.’

Asked if he had picked the 
seat where he will stand as a candidate, he added: ‘No. Thanet South is 
up there in my top two or three.

‘I’m going to stand somewhere in the South East, more than likely in Kent.’

It is understood that as well as South
 Thanet, Mr Farage is considering other options including Folkestone, 
Dover and North Thanet.

Ukip is due to unveil its party manifesto at its conference in Doncaster in September. Mr Farage last night suggested that it could include a pledge to axe inheritance tax.

‘Compared to the cost of collection it raises a pitiful amount of revenue,’ he said. ‘The people that have died have paid tax on this stuff already, why should the next generation not benefit?’

Mr Mackinlay, 47, was one of the founders of the Anti-Federalist League, a forerunner to Ukip set up in 1991.

He was leader of the party briefly in 1997 before serving as deputy leader until 2000.

He defected to the Conservatives in 2005, declaring that he wanted to be part of a party that would form a future government ‘rather than messing around on the fringes’.
