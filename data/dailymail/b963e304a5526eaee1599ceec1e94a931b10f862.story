Dressed in a floor-skimming crimson gown, the Netherlands' Queen Máxima was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for the traditional Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day] session of the Dutch Parliament.

With her husband King Willem-Alexander, 47, by her side, Máxima, 43, cut a dramatic figure as she stepped out of the gold-gilt state coach outside the Parliament building in the Hague.

Sporting a royal blue sash of office and a neat crimson cap, she and her husband then processed into the chamber where MPs were waiting for the traditional royal speech setting out the next year's business.

Royal welcome: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and his wife Queen Maxima wave to crowds

The Dutch equivalent of the State Opening of Parliament, Prinsjesdag sees the monarch give details of the government's programme for the next financial year, as well as budget allocations.

With the sixth largest economy in the Eurozone, the Netherlands one of the few still powering ahead - a small wobble earlier this year notwithstanding - despite the malaise elsewhere.

The country was also hit by tragedy earlier this year when Malaysia Airways Flight MH17 was shot down on its flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing 193 Dutch nationals.

Neither, however, stopped well-wishers from gathering in the Hague to greet the royals, who have been on the throne of the Netherlands for just over a year.

Round of applause: Maxima looked thrilled at the positive response to her husband's speech to Parliament

Following the King's speech, the royal couple were driven to the Noordeinde Palace, where they later appeared on the balcony to wave to crowds.

There, they were joined by Willem-Alexander's younger brother Prince Constantijn and his wife Princess Laurentien.

The group of four smiled broadly as they waved to well-wishers, while their mother, the former Queen Beatrix, 76, was also present and waved to crowds from the King's Office. 

The Argentina-born Dutch Queen has seen her popularity soar in recent months thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families.

She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil.
