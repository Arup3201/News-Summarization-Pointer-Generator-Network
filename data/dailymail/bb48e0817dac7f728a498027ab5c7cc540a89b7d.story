Swedish golfer Helen Alfredsson has come under fire for making a sick joke about the Glasgow helicopter live on air

A female golfer has been forced to apologise for making an 'inappropriate and distasteful' remark about the Glasgow helicopter disaster while commentating live on air.

Sweden's Helen Alfredsson, who won 11 tournaments on the Ladies European Tour before retiring in September, is understood to have made reference to the helicopter crash which occurred in Glasgow last Friday, killing nine people.

As a noisy helicopter passed overhead, she told viewers she 'hoped  they are better pilots than they are in Scotland'.

In the wake of Alfredsson's remark, 
viewers bombarded Sky Sports, which was airing the event, with 
complaints, calling for the Swedish retired golfer to be sacked.

Scots
Sky presenter David Livingstone immediately apologised on air. Later the broadcaster issued their own statement apologising for the incident.

Alfredsson, 48, who issued a statement via the LET, said: 'Regretfully I made an inappropriate and distasteful comment on air today and apologise unreservedly for any offence that was caused by this mistake.

'I did not intend to hurt anybody and I am devastated if I have hurt anyone. I feel very embarrassed because this was not intended in any shape or form.'

LET chief executive officer Ivan Khodabakhsh added: 'Helen Alfredsson's comment on air was clearly careless but people who know Helen will realise that she would never have intended to hurt someone and I do not believe this was the case.'

Although Alfredsson was not working directly for them, broadcaster Sky Sports said they were 'shocked' by the comments and also issued an apology.

Nine people died when a police helicopter crashed into the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow on Friday

The helicopter is said to have dropped from the sky 'like a stone.' The Air Accidents Investigation Branch in Farnborough, Hampshire is working to establish what happened

A spokesman for Sky said: 'Sky Sports offered coverage of the Dubai Ladies Masters tournament on Thursday with live pictures and commentary provided by a world feed broadcaster, supported by presentation from our own studios in London.

'Sky has no control over the commentary from the event, which is shared by a number of international broadcasters, and we were shocked at the unacceptable comments made by one of the analysts.

'As soon as coverage switched back to our studio in London, our presenter David Livingstone apologised and we reiterate our apology for the offence caused by these comments. We have also expressed our strong concerns to the world feed broadcaster.'

The golfer's gaffe came less than a week a police helicopter crashed into Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow on Friday night.

Pilot David Traill, 51, was killed along with eight others.

Reaction on Twitter revealed viewers' disgust and anger at Alfredsson's gaffe.

Ken Herring wrote: ' hope Helen Alfredsson has been fired. Disgraceful comments about Glaswegian helicopter pilots in her commentary.'

Kieran Clark posted: 'Astonishingly stupid comments from Helen Alfredsson earlier.

'A misguided and insensitive attempt to try to be funny.'

The 43-year-old Swede was a leading figure on the Ladies Professional Golf Tour until her retirement in September this year.
