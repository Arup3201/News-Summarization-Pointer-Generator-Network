Strictly was the sequin spotted winner as the biggest ratings battle in British TV got under way at the weekend.

The BBC dance show beat ITV’s X Factor by raking in 300,000 more viewers.

While the corporation’s debut show for the 11th series unveiled a line-up of fresh faces, its X Factor rival featured several acts seen by viewers before.

Winner: The opening weekend of Strictly Come Dancing gained more viewers than the X Factor

Not having the last laugh: The X factor's Gary Barlow and Sharon Osbourne might have been having fun, but more viewers were tuned into the BBC

What did you watch this weekend?

Yesterday critics suggested Strictly may be on top because the public have grown bored with watching ‘vulnerable people being exploited’ on Simon Cowell’s ITV show.

Viewers were left with a feeling of deja vu watching the X Factor as acts that have previously auditioned for the programme re-appeared once more.

Pippa Smith, of the Safer Media campaign group, said playing with people’s emotions was the ‘driving force’ of X Factor and said she was unsurprised that this turned viewers off.

Strictly averaged 8.4million viewers on Saturday with 9.4million tuning in for its peak ratings.

Star: It would have been yet another flawless performance for host Sir Bruce Forsyth had it not been for the difficult pronunciation of the new foreign dancers' names

However, the X Factor – which last week saw a boost in viewing figures following the return of Sharon Osbourne – peaked at 9.1million and averaged 8.3million viewers.

In contrast to the X Factor ‘repeats’, Strictly Come Dancing saw its celebrity contestants paired up with their professional dance partners, as well as musical entertainment from stars including Rod Stewart and  Jessie J.

It would have been yet another flawless performance for host Sir Bruce Forsyth – had it not been for the difficult pronunciation of the new foreign dancers’ names.

The 85-year-old – who has presented the series alongside Tess Daly for the past 11 years – worked through cue cards and appeared to wrestle over a few of the particularly long new names.

Under the disco ball, he read: ‘Now let’s get to know them all a little bit better. Please welcome from Lithuania Iveta Luk..o…siute…’

He then paused and jokingly told the audience to ‘Shut up’ as they laughed at the mispronunciation.

Unfazed, he carried on with the list before finishing: ‘And thank goodness an easy one – all the way from Grimsby Kevin Clifton.’

Some fans on Twitter questioned where all the British dancers were.

Kirsty Joyce said: ‘Lots of new sexy boys and girls from Eastern Europe on Strictly and who does the UK bring to the party? Kevin from Grimsby. Nice one!’

Of the 15 professional dancers competing in this year’s Strictly competition just four are from the UK, with none of professional females coming from British soil.  

Re-run: Viewers might be bored of the same acts appearing year after year on the ITV talent show including Amy Mottram, pictured, who has previously made it to judges' houses

History repeating: Girl band Dolly Rockers had also previously appeared on the X Factor and appeared again during the 'double auditions' on Saturday and Sunday

All change: Strictly had a new batch of celebrities ready to take to the floor for its latest series, including former rugby ace Ben Cohen, as well as some new professional dancers

Four of the dancers are from Russia with the rest of the quota being made up of dancers from Kazakhstan, Poland and Venezuela.

Last year Cowell endured a tough few 
months as ratings for his UK X Factor show slumped to their lowest ever 
levels since 2008. In 2010 X Factor typically attracted 14.13m.

Popular: Strictly also trounced Simon Cowell's ITV1 show in the ratings last year
