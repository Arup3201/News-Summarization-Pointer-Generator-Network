Jamie Carragher could not contain his laughter during Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show when he was told Fabricio Coloccini was the favourite to replace Alan Pardew at Newcastle.

Newcastle are on the lookout for a new boss following Pardew's move to Crystal Palace and captain Coloccini emerged as a surprise contender to take over the reins at St James' Park.

The 32-year-old defender was, at the time, ahead of established managers Steve Bruce, Tony Pulis and Steve McClaren in the bookmakers' odds to replace Pardew.

Sky Sports presenter Ed Chamberlin announced: 'A bit of breaking news for you, it is Coloccini who is the favourite for the Newcastle job so far.'

Carragher responded by laughing at the suggestion that Coloccini could take up such a role.

The Independent suggests Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is 'ready to turn to the long-serving Argentinian club captain' after Pardew's sudden exit.

However Coloccini, who has played 231 times for Newcastle since joining from Deportivo La Coruna for £10.3million in August 2008, has now drifted out.

When asked who he thought Mike Ashley should appoint as manager, Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker was also dismissive of the contenders.

'Newcastle had a good manager who was under appreciated,' Lineker wrote on BreatheSport. 'This may become more apparent in time. Be careful what you wish for.' 

Newcastle captain Coloccini arrives at Newcastle's training ground on Tuesday morning 

John Carver and Steve Stone will take caretaker charge of Newcastle's next two games following Pardew's departure to Selhurst Park. 

The Geordie duo were left in the dark about the manager’s intention to quit the club and their future remains unknown. 

Carver has a 100 per cent record as caretaker of his hometown club having overseen a 3-0 win against Blackburn in 2004 in the wake of Sir Bobby Robson’s sacking. 

The North East outfit host Burnley on New Year's Day before travelling to the King Power Stadium to take on Leicester City in the third round of the FA Cup. 

Pardew is expected to sign a four-year deal at Crystal Palace after being given permission by Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, to begin negotiations with the south London outfit. 

The 53-year-old played for Palace from 1987 to 1991 during his playing days.

Pardew has managed to seal a return to Palace as Eagles co-owner Steve Parish agreed to fork out £2m on securing his prime managerial target. 

His last game in charge of Newcastle saw the Magpies beat Everton 3-2 thanks to goals by Papiss Cisse, Ayoze Perez and Jack Colback.

Newcastle United can confirm that Crystal Palace have made a formal approach requesting permission to speak to Alan Pardew in relation to their vacant managerial position.

Crystal Palace have offered compensation at a level whereby Alan has now been permitted to speak to them.

As a result of this development today (Monday), Alan will not be at training on Tuesday. Training will be the responsibility of assistant manager John Carver.

The club will make a further announcement in due course.
