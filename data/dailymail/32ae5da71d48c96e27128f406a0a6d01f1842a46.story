A British grandfather has collapsed and died on a boat trip in the Mediterranean.

Frank Racher, 67, died while swimming in the sea after setting off on a cruise around the coastline of Marmaris in Turkey. 

Mr Racher from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics after his body was dragged back on board the Mega-Diana cruise ship on Friday.

Mr Racher was on board the boat with his wife June, 61, and other British tourists when it stopped at Paradise Island ten minutes after setting off.

Leaving his wife on board, Mr Racher decided to go for a swim, but quickly found himself struggling in the water.

Fellow passengers and crew members brought his body back on board before emergency services arrived and performed CPR for nearly half-an hour.

Despite their best efforts the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

One passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was very sad. One minute we were all enjoying a fabulous day on the water, having a few beers. The next, it was chaos.

‘The crew and coastguard tried so hard to revive him - we can’t believe 
he died. It was so sad - all the passengers on board were shocked - most
were in tears - it was tragic.'

Mr Racher’s daughter, Joanne, posted on her Facebook page: ‘Sadly, Dad died today on holiday in Turkey on a boat-trip.

'He always said he wanted to die at sea so he got his wish – rest in peace, Dad.’

The family, from Norfolk, were regular visitors to Marmaris where they have taken summer holidays for the last six years.
