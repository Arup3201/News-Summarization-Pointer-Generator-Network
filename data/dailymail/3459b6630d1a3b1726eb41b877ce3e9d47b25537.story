It's the most famous tune on television, the bounding fanfare that joyfully announces: ‘The football is here.’ Treasured by millions up and down the country, it marks the start of many a fan’s Saturday night ritual. And it was all recorded in a north London basement.

Ask even the most ardent non-football fan to hum the theme tune to Match of the Day and they will probably be able to give it a good go. Firmly a part of British culture, Barry Stoller’s classic composition has been integral to the programme since 1970. Now, 44 years after its debut, Stoller has been talking for the first time about how he composed the most recognised TV tune in Britain.

Fanfare: Barry Stoller’s classic composition has been integral to Match of the Day since 1970

Surrounded by music from an early age – as a four-year-old he memorised Tchaikovsky ballets from his parents’ record collection – it was the guitar that really got a 16-year-old Stoller started. Some early covers led to a chart single, ‘Chariot’, which reached number 26 in 1961, but orchestral composition was always the aim.

‘I was really interested in orchestral sounds and that’s where I wanted to be,’ says Stoller, who turns 73 this year. ‘I put together a home recording studio in the basement of my family home, probably one of the very first.

‘The majority of recordings were guitar and bass, but I wanted orchestral sounds. There were no samplers or synthesisers in those days but there was the clavioline, a little keyboard that could make the sound of trumpets, flutes, strings. So I started to build up the sound of an orchestra.’

It was this classical background that provided the foundations for the Match of the Day theme. After being introduced to the programme editor by his cousin, Stoller had his chance but, with no brief on what was required, he was left to find his own inspiration.

‘All they said was they wanted “something good!” I started thinking about the game itself but I didn’t see that as the way to find the theme. It needed something to focus on. 

Result: Stoller's brief for Match of the Day theme tune was to come up with 'something good'

‘In general I’m not really a sports-minded person, but I thought about the crowds, all the thousands and millions of people that go to matches. There’s excitement, there’s joy, there’s a euphoria in the air. It’s electrifying and I thought if I can catch that energy, that magic of the people, and get it into the music then that would be it. That’s what I wanted to do and somehow it got in there.’ 

‘It was the very end of the song that I heard first. I was thinking about gladiators and sportsmen and I heard that as being played by trumpets. Then the melody came into my mind and I just had it.’

After being selected by the BBC from half a dozen entries, a professional orchestra was brought in to record a new version for television, but things did not quite go to plan.

‘The amazing thing about it was when you heard it perfectly played, it didn’t have the same magic as the original,’ says Stoller. ‘You wouldn’t believe it but these things happen.’

So it is the home-recorded demo, played by just three musicians in a London basement, which survives to this day. But that longevity still remains a mystery to its composer.

‘I’ve tried to think about why it’s so successful and you can’t really pin it down. In essence what makes it is the public. They’re the ones who have made it what it is, not me. It’s a very strange thing.

‘They have tried to do different arrangements but the people go crazy. Even Cardinal Hume, a big Newcastle fan, wanted it played at his funeral. That’s a hell of a thing that he should want that.’

But, despite its immense popularity, the theme did not lead to many musical opportunities for Stoller.

‘Its strange,’ he says, ‘I almost feel divorced from it. It was the major piece of my career but I’ve hardly had any other commissions at all. Sometimes I can’t relate to being part of it. I don’t perceive myself in any way important in that respect.

‘I’m hoping now that other things spin off it and I can let people hear what other music I’ve done. If it’s going to change my life, it’s going to be now.

‘I would never have thought it would last this long and it’s got to the point where I’ll have to think about leaving it something in my will! It reincarnates itself every time it gets played and it always sounds fresh.

‘I’m phenomenally grateful to the public. They’ve done something that’s never happened for me. They have given me an award in their recognition of it. What price can you put on that?

‘It’s my love and it’s like a child. It’s out there, it’s been places, it’s grown up and it’s still there. Look after it!’
