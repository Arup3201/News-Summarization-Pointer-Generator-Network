Comeback: Debenhams said it has seen sales of rucksacks soar by 114 per cent

Backpacks are back in fashion thanks to the increasing necessity of busy Britons needing to be hands-free as they move around.

For this once humble symbol of the budget traveller is the new brief-case, hand bag and holdall, rolled into one, according to the latest research.

High Street retailer Debenhams reported yesterday that it has seen a 114per cent increase in sales of backpacks which industry observers attribute to the increasing use of smartphones as they leave the wearer's hands free to text, tweet, or surf the internet.

A Nineties favourite, the utilitarian carry-all has been given an upmarket make-over and become the surprise must-have accessory of 2014.

Model of the moment Cara Delevingne has given the trend the ultimate stamp of approval by unveiling her own backpack collection for exclusive Brit brand Mulberry this week, while trend-setters like Alexa Chung and Rihanna, have been seen enjoying the benefits of the reborn-rucksack.

According to fashion insiders the secret to this look is to remember - size matters.

Debenhams Head of Accessories Design, Natelle Baddeley said: 'Too small and you look like you are still stuck in the Nineties, too big and you may be mistaken for an actual backpacker!

'The key size is medium, get that right and the wonderful versatility of the backpack is immediately apparent.

'It provides a practical, fashion forward update to a handbag, and is also a great alternative for both sexes to a briefcase.

Hands free: Industry experts have suggested the rise in popularity is due to the rise in use of smartphones, leaving women both hands to use their phones

'There is a fantastic choice of styles available right now. Solid colours in nylon, canvas and especially leather, work well for a smart, business-look, while chic prints with contrasting trim in denim, faux leather and even mini pom-poms are right on trend.'

Designer backpacks alone have shown a 23% sales uplift over the last month with Debenhams H! By Henry Holland range proving particularly popular.

Ms Baddeley added: 'Backpacks were popular with bloggers at Fashion Week, and high end brands were including them on the runway in top quality leather for work, as well as casual weekend styles using innovative new materials.'

The term 'backpack' was first coined in 1910 in the United States with hikers being the first group to adopt this style of bag. Today, as well as becoming a fashion item, it has evolved into a travellers' staple, and is used by school children globally.

Debenhams' backpacks are available in all stores nationwide and online at debenhams.com.

Prices range from £20 to £45 by designers at Debenhams, H! By Henry Holland and Red Herring.
