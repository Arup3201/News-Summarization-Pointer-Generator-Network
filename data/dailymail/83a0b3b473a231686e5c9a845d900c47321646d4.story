The wife of a retired banker who lived a luxury lifestyle off the proceeds of £10million land investment scam has been spared jail.

Linda Noad, 58, helped her husband Roger, 60, launder £655,000 which they then used to help their fund their £1million family home in Sevenoaks, Kent, as well as a lavish holiday in Dubai.

Roger Noad, who spent 27 years working at Coutts bank, was jailed for three years for allowing the proceeds to be funnelled through his bank accounts over six years.

The land investment scam on wealthy pensioners and Thalidomide survivors was masterminded by their conman son Matthew, 30, and his associate Clive Griston, 52, who were both jailed for four years and eight months earlier this year.

Matthew's parents spent the money on fine wines, jewellery worth £18,000 and a new Mercedes. 

But Mrs Noad, who suffers from depression and left her job at Sainsbury’s in shame when the story hit the newspapers, was given a two-year suspended sentence at the Old Bailey.

Judge Christopher Moss QC told her: ‘I ought to send you straight to prison, however I am prepared to take what may be thought to be a merciful course.

‘You and your husband received that money from your son who was one of the architects of a land bank fraud which stole £10million from elderly investors.

‘You used it to enhance your standard of living including the house in which you presently live.

‘Your family is in effect in tatters and both your son and husband are serving substantial prison sentences. You deserve to do the same.

‘It is clear you are and have been suffering greatly from the convictions of your son and husband, although it could be said you brought this situation on yourself.’

Mrs Noad sighed loudly in relief and looked up to family members in the public gallery as she learned she would not go to prison.

The judge told her: ‘You are now free to go.’

The Noads now face having their home and other assets confiscated to repay the victims of the fraud.

During the series of trials relating to the £10million fraud, jurors were told how Matthew Noad and Clive Griston targeted vulnerable pensioners eager to invest their life savings.

The pair used glossy brochures to persuade investors to buy land on the basis they would get high returns if it was developed.

Griston laundered £1million of the proceeds through his partner Kerry Golesworthy, 48, who was jailed for three-and-a-half years at an earlier hearing.

Golesworthy drove a £109,000 Bentley, bought a £10,000 pearl necklace and a new house in a private estate near Orpington, in Kent, which is now valued at around £2m.

At the time she earned less than £9,000 a year as a bookkeeper.

Golesworthy and Linda and Roger Noad were all convicted of entering into an arrangement facilitating the use of criminal property relating to the land fraud.

Matthew Noad, of Keston, Kent, and Griston were convicted of fraud and jailed in April this year.
