On sale: Prized Wagyu beef, pictured, originally form Japan and known for its succulence, is to be sold at budget supermarket Aldi

Budget chain Aldi is bringing the world’s most expensive beef to its aisles at £6.99 for a sirloin steak.

The company has managed to get supplies of prized Wagyu beef, which originated in Japan and is renowned for its flavour and succulence.

Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo – putting it out of reach for most families.

However, Aldi will sell the Wagyu meat for around £25 a kilo, which works out at £6.99 for an eight ounce (227g) rib-eye or sirloin steak.

Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture.

The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century.

Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around.

Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition.

However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK. The Aldi supplies, which go into stores on June 12, have been imported from New Zealand.

Managing director of corporate buying at Aldi, Tony Baines, said: ‘At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. This summer, our shoppers are looking to buy the finest fresh meat, so the steaks fill a real gap in the market.’

The move to offer luxury food at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the ‘big four’ – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

The formula is clearly working, for 
new industry figures show annual sales at the no-frills German owned 
chain are rising at 35.9per cent a year, while rival Lidl is seeing a 
22.7per cent surge in sales.

Both are eating in to the market share of Tesco, where sales are down by 3.1per cent, Morrisons, which has seen a fall of 3.9per cent, and Sainsbury’s.

Currently only Asda, which offers its own British Wagyu beef at bargain prices and pursues a budget prices strategy, is managing to stem the tide of customers switching to cheaper rivals.

The director of corporate buying at Aldi said shoppers at the budget store 'love to try out specialist products'. Annual sales at the no-frills chain are rising at a rate of 35.9 per cent a year, officials say

The boss of Morrisons, Dalton Philips, has described the success of the budget chains as having the most profound effect on food shopping since the 1950s.

He has responded by announcing a three year price cutting campaign that will reduce prices by £1billion, which has effectively forced all the other mainstream grocers to follow suit.

The fierce price competition is delivering real benefits for families with figures from retail experts Kantar putting grocery basket inflation at just 1.2per cent.

Grocery industry expert at Kantar Worldpanel, Edward Garner, said the rise of the budget chains is putting a brake on food price rises across the high street.

He said: ‘Lidl achieved a record market share of 3.6per cent, accelerating with its highest ever year-on-year growth of 22.7per cent.  Similarly, Aldi has gained 35.9per cent and retains its record 4.7per cent share.’

‘Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have all lost market share since this period last year, while Tesco and Morrisons recorded sales drops of 3.1per cent and 3.9per cent respectively.’

The director general of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said food price inflation is at its lowest level since at least December 2006.

‘This is  great news for hard-pressed households as the summer approaches, and confirms that retailers are responding to current conditions by matching attractive offers with those products most in demand at this time of the year,’ she said.

Mike Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said: ‘Food inflation is still low, many supermarkets are price cutting and non-food prices remain deflationary, so the high street continues to generate little inflationary pressure.

‘Little in the way of immediate seasonal or weather related price increases is anticipated so the outlook for the next three months is for relatively stable shop price inflation. Helped by the increases in consumer confidence since the start of the year, this should encourage shoppers to spend more freely over the summer months.’
