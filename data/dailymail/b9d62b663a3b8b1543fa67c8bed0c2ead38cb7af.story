A celebrated set of church bells have been silenced after market traders operating in the area complained that the three hours of deafening chiming lost them valuable business.

The ten bells at St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestershire, were chiming in a rare full peal as a gesture of goodwill to the local community.

But the relentless noise was not appreciated by workers at The Shambles Market - which has been a permanent fixture in the church's vicinity every Friday and Saturday since the 16th century.

St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestshire, has received a letter of complaint after its bells chimed for three hours on Saturday

Andy Soutar, of the Global Organic fruit and vegetable stall which backs on to the church's gates, said: 'It went on for more than three hours.

'Apart from us not being able to think, there was a definite line in the market where people were not going. 

'They just wouldn't go in to that space because of the noise.'

Mr Soutar complained to the church after Saturday's three-hour bombardment but claims he is yet to receive a response. 

Local traders at The Shambles Market, which lies in the grand church's shadow, (the steeple can be seen in top left of picture) said their customers were being driven away by the deafening sound of continuous ringing

The Shambles Market in Stroud, Gloucestershire, features rows of outdoor stalls lined along The Shambles - the road which leads up to the church

He added: 'I am not against bell ringing or the church but this did go on for quite a long time and it affected trade.

'I hope some compromise can be found.'

The next big peal was scheduled for November with a visiting bell-ringing team set to do the honours. 

A peal is the name given to a specific type of performance of change ringing, the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a series of mathematical patterns.

For a performance to be recognised as a peal it must consist of at least 5040 changes on up to seven working bells. 

The event has now been cancelled to the dismay of St Laurence's regular church-goers. 

Ron Cree, who runs the indoor market in St Laurence Church Hall, said he was not affected.

He said: 'We could not really hear it inside. I heard that some market stall holders outside had written to the church because it got on their nerves a bit.'

Team rector, Reverend Malcolm King and church wardens Deirdre Baker and Mike Lambert issued a statement in response. 

'St Laurence Church has 10 bells - there are not many local churches with that number and of course the bells become popular for visiting bell ringers,' the statement read.

'On the morning of September 27 a visiting bellringer team managed to ring a full peal - quite an achievement in itself - which lasted for three hours and five minutes.

'This is the first time a full peel has been rung on a Saturday morning for quite a while.

'We understand that certain outside market stall holders found it difficult to hear for the length of time the peal was rung. 

'It is a fact that church bells are of a certain volume so that they can be heard!

'As a goodwill gesture we have cancelled a peal that was to be rung by another visiting bellringer team on a Saturday morning in November.

'Any future peals for commemorations of events or ringing before or after religious services will take place as normal.' 

The market has been running on Fridays and Saturdays in the small Gloucestershire town since the 16th century

The next full peal of bells were scheduled for November but have now been cancelled out of consideration of the market traders
