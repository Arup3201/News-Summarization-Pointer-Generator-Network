'Daft': The news will alarm a growing number of jam-makers

The threat of jam-makers being fined under EU rules for selling or donating produce in re-used jars triggered anger and exasperation yesterday.

Stalls offering home-made conserves and chutneys are a staple of summer fetes, church fairs and other charity fundraisers.

However an advisory body linked to the Church of England has warned parishes that re-using jars breached EU health rules – and could result in a £5,000 fine or even jail.

In a letter entitled ‘this is not a 
spoof’, the Churches’ Legislation Advisory Service said that following 
advice from the Food Standards Agency members are not allowed ‘to make 
jam, put it in re-used jam jars then either sell it or even give it away
 at a public event’. 

The Women’s Institute has offered similar advice to its 210,000 members.

The EU regulations ban the re-use of 
containers unless they are specifically designed for this. The aim is to
 prevent chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating 
food.

However, the FSA says enforcement is 
down to individual local authorities.

Last night, Environment Secretary 
Owen Paterson called for ‘common sense’ to prevail.

He said: ‘Re-using a few jars to sell homemade jam at a fete is at the heart of British country life.

‘There hasn’t been a single prosecution since these rules were introduced and I sincerely hope that there won’t be any.

‘What’s called for here is a good dose
 of healthy common sense from everyone.’

Take note: The written circular from the Churches' Legislation Advisory Service

The regulations have caused 
alarm within the Church community.

Canon Michael Tristram of Portsmouth 
Cathedral, said: ‘On realising that this was not a belated April Fool’s 
joke, I was very anxious, not only from the fund-raising point of view, 
but also because it goes against the green agenda of recycling.

'We jam- 
and marmalade-makers sterilise our jars as a matter of course.’

There was also consternation from the 
WI, with its chairman Ruth Bond saying: ‘WI members have been making jam
 and chutney for sale through local fetes and fairs since the 
organisation’s beginnings in 1915 and consumers’ safety is always a top 
priority.’

Cookery writer Mary Berry, who is a 
judge on the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, was more forthright. She 
said: ‘This is absolutely stupid.

‘We are encouraging people to save 
money by using fruits to make chutneys and jam, and if they have to buy 
new jars it will become much too expensive. It’s daft.’

A spokesman for the FSA confirmed the 
EU rule but added that it was not aware ‘of any evidence indicating that
 re-use of jam jars presents a food safety concern in terms of migration
 of chemicals from jam jars into food’.
