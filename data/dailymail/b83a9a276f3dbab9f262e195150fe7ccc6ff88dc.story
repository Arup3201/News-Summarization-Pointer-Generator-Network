Scared: Michael Le Vell is being sent hate messages and death threats since he was cleared of child sex charges

Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has become the subject of a hate campaign and is receiving death threats since he was cleared of child sex charges last month. 

In the latest in a series of incidents Le Vell, 48, was forced to call the police after someone smashed the rear window of his silver Ford Puma yesterday.

People have been leaving messages on his Facebook and Twitter accounts and he also fears he has been followed to his home in Hale, Cheshire. 

A friend told The Sunday Mirror: 'Michael is scared for his life.

'What started with hate-mail over the internet has turned into something far more sinister.' 

The actor, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, returned to the set of Coronation Street this week for the first time since he was found not guilty of child sex offences. 

But the 48-year-old was not back in Weatherfield to reprise his role as Kevin Webster - instead he was taking his sisters on a VIP tour of the well-known set. 

Le Vell is not due to return to Coronation Street until February next year.

The actor was never suspended by the ITV soap.

He was recently ditched by bosses on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

During the trial the star was forced to 
admit he sank up to 12 pints a night, had a string of one-night stands 
and an affair while his wife had cancer treatment as the prosecution 
tried unsuccessfully to persuade the jury his 'dark little secrets' 
included child abuse.

In May he had a drink thrown over him in his local pub The Railway.

Tweets directed at the actors include one which said he should be 'axed in the skull' while another said: 'Needs his head cutting off'. 

Le Vell celebrated with a pint of lager after he was found not guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a girl from the age of six.

The jury in the Coronation Street star's trial took less than five hours to clear him of the child abuse charges he said left him 'fighting for my life'.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We were called to a report of damage to a motor vehicle in the Hale area of Manchester. Enquiries are ongoing.'
