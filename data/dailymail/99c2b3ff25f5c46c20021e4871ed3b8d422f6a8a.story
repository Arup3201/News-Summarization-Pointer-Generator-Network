Former President Bill Clinton says wife Hillary has recovered from the concussion and blood clot she suffered a year and a half ago.

Speaking at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation’s annual Fiscal Summit in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Clinton said Hillary had done six months of 'very serious work' to overcome her health issues and she 'seems to have more stamina now.'

'Look, she works out every week. She is strong. She is doing 
great,' Clinton said according to Buzzfeed. 'As far as I can tell, she’s in better shape than I am.'

Former President Bill Clinton laughs as he answers a question from Gwen Ifill of PBS NewsHour regarding Republicans' questions regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's head injury at the 2014 Fiscal Summit in Washington, D.C.

Former George W. Bush adviser Karl 
Rove kicked off a discussion about Hillary's physical condition last week when he 
suggested at a conference that she was hiding something about her 
health.

'Thirty days in the 
hospital?' Rove said, according to the New York Post. 'And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for
 people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with 
that.'

The Post insinuated that Rove claimed Hillary may be suffering from brain damage as a result of the clot.

'Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there 
are no words for this level of lying,'  Clinton spokesman Nick 
Merrill fired back.

'She is 100%. Period,' he said of Hillary's heath.

Rove told Fox News yesterday he never said Hillary had brain damage.

'She had a serious health episode and my point was 
that I think it was from the 7th of December in 2012 through the 7th of 
January of 2013, she underwent, first she had apparently a serious 
virus,' he said after being confronted with the fact that the former secretary of state was only in the hospital for three days, not 30 days.

After Rove explained his comments on Fox, Merrill accused Republicans of politicizing Hillary's health.

'First they
 accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- 
and are flat out lying,' he said.

'Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over 
the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he doesn't care, 
because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, 
and he's succeeding. It's flagrant and thinly veiled.'

Picture of health: Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to the audience at the conclusion of her address to the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Global Forum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. Clinton has been traveling the country, giving speeches since July 2013 - six months after the State Department said she had 'fully recovered' from her accident in December 2012

Hillary Clinton took ill in December 2012 just as she was supposed to testify before a Congressional committee about the terrorist attack that took four American lives in Benghazi, Libya three months before.

As a result of the blood clot, Clinton did not appear before Congress until the following month, leading some Republicans to speculate about the timing of her hospitalization.

Clinton left the State Department in February of that year, and hit the speaking circuit just five months later. She's spent the last year giving speeches on he own behalf and on behalf of the Clinton Foundation and working on her memoir, Hard Choices, which comes out in June. She is a presumed 2016 presidential candidate.

Today Bill Clinton said he was 'sort of dumbfounded' by Republicans' on going questions about Hillary's health, saying they would do 'whatever it takes' to sully her political career.

'First they they said she faked her concussion. And
 now they say she's auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead,' he 
said.

Clinton laughed Hillary's critics off, saying, 'You can’t be too upset about it.'

'It’s just the beginning. They’ll get better and better about it,' he said. 'It’s just part of the deal.'

As for Rove, Clinton said, 'I got to give him 
credit, you know, that embodies that old saying that consistency is the 
hobgoblin of little minds.'
