As Britain’s best-known entrepreneur he has not been shy of wrapping himself – and his airline – in the Union flag.

But billionaire Sir Richard Branson has quit the UK to live full-time on his holiday island in a Caribbean tax haven, it was revealed yesterday.

The Virgin tycoon said he and wife Joan had chosen to move permanently to Necker as it allowed them to ‘live life to the full’ and enabled him to pursue hobbies including kite-surfing, tennis and pilates.

The 63-year-old denied reports he had 
left Britain to become a tax exile, saying he was too wealthy to allow 
tax considerations to dictate where he should live.

The
 British Virgin Islands have an income tax rate of zero, rather than the
 45 per cent top rate in the UK. Sir Richard said: ‘I have not left 
Britain for tax reasons, but for my love of the beautiful British Virgin
 Islands and in particular Necker Island... We feel it gives me and my 
wife Joan the best chance to live another productive few decades. We can
 also look after our health.

‘There is no better place to stay active and I can kite-surf, surf, play tennis, swim, do pilates and just play.’

Sir Richard previously lived in a 200-acre Oxfordshire estate and a mansion in Holland Park, West London.

The
 London property was sold almost seven years ago and documents lodged 
with the Land Registry show the Oxfordshire estate was sold to his 
children, Holly and Sam, for £1.35million in August last year.

Sir
 Richard, who is worth an estimated £3.5billion, has previously 
criticised wealthy individuals who left Britain to escape high tax 
rates. Earlier this year he said Britain’s tax regime was ‘very 
reasonable’ when compared to countries such as France, where high 
earners pay 80 per cent tax, and said it would be wrong for Chancellor 
George Osborne to lower rates for the wealthy.

In
 a statement on the Virgin website yesterday, he said: ‘I have been very
 fortunate to accumulate so much wealth in my career, more than I need 
in my lifetime, and would not live somewhere I don’t want to for tax 
reasons.’

Sir Richard will 
continue to pay tax on any UK income but Virgin Group Holdings, which 
encompasses his business empire, is controlled by family trusts based in
 the BVI, according to The Sunday Times.

Although
 he remains the public face of Virgin he said he now devoted the vast 
majority of his time to not-for-profit ventures and charity.

Sir Richard
 added: ‘The companies... have created tens of thousands of jobs and 
paid hundreds of millions in tax (and will continue to do so)... I also 
travel the world sharing what I’ve learned by doing speeches and trying 
to help the next generation of entrepreneurs.

‘One
 hundred per cent of any monies I earn from these engagements I give to 
charity. This amounts to many millions per year, and will continue to do
 so.’

Sir Richard’s 
spokesman said he had lived on Necker for seven years and stressed it 
made no difference for tax purposes if he lived in the UK or the BVI.
