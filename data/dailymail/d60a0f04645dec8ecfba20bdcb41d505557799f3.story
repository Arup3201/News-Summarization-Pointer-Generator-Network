Most people tend to use irons to remove creases from their clothing and bed linen.

But one enterprising artist chose to mimic his artistic heroes by doing quite the opposite - using his trusty domestic tool to purposefully crease a white sheet.

The technique helped the artist create replicas of masterpieces by classic Dutch painters van Gogh, Rembrandt and Vermeer.

The works have all been skilfully recreated to be used in an advert for electrical company Philips in Russia.

One of Vincent van Gogh’s most renowned works, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, is one of the piece's interpreted by the artist using his iron.

Known for his distinctive self-portraits, this particular piece captures van Gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else.

Completed in 1889, the year before his death, the painting shows van Gogh smoking a pipe and wearing a hat. It is currently part of a private collection.

Girl With a Pearl Earring is widely regarded as Johannes Vermeer's best work.

It is usually housed in the Mauritshuis gallery, based in The Hague, although the famous painting is currently part of the gallery's touring collection in Japan.

A novel of the same name was written by author Tracy Chevalier in 1999 based on the fictional character.

A film adaption of the book was released in 2003, starring Scarlett Johansson.

The last painting reworked by the artist was Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar.

The self-portrait has been housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC since 1937, having been painted by the artist in 1659.
