An Ohio State athlete who killed himself was found by a neuropathologist to have suffered from concussions but did not show evidence of chronic brain damage.

Wrestler and football player Kosta Karageorge, 22, had been missing for several days when his body was found in a trash bin with a handgun near his right hand in Columbus on November 30.

Coroner Dr Anahi Ortiz waited for neuropathology reports about Karageorge's brain before reaffirming in a final report issued on Friday that he died from a gunshot  to the head.

Neuropathologist Dr Norman Lehman from Ohio State University said there was evidence of prior concussive injury, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

However, Karageorge was not found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition which results from continuous head trauma.

CTE can only be diagnosed after death and symptoms include depression, confusion and anger issues, according to Cleveland.com

In January, Ortiz had ruled the athlete's death a suicide.

Investigators concluded that Karageorge and his girlfriend broke up around the time he disappeared on November 26

The senior defensive tackle was last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk.

Karageorge texted his girlfriend after 1am that day, saying he loved her and wanted to talk, according to text records released by police this year. 

When he received responses asking him not to speak again to her, he replied, 'I am gonna kill myself,' and he said that she should not go to his funeral, according to records.

Texts sent to his mother, Susan Karageorge moments later said concussions were affecting his mind and he hoped he was not an embarrassment.

Karageorge's body was discovered not far from his campus-area apartment by a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body

She told police she received a text from her son around 1.30am on that said: 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.'

Karageorge's mother told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of extreme confusion.

He was discovered not far from his campus-area apartment by a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body. 

Dr Tom McAllister, chairman of psychiatry at Indiana University, who has studied concussions in college athletes, said that brain injuries seem to increase the likelihood of depression.

If the person had depression or an anxiety disorder in the past, 'it often is the case that the concussion seems to exacerbate it,' he said. 'These injuries don't occur in a vacuum. People bring their own past history...into the injury.'
