British aid workers were last night involved in a desperate search for survivors after landslides destroyed a remote town in Afghanistan, killing an estimated 2,100 people.

The team from the Department for International Development (DFID) joined forces with United Nations and Red Crescent workers after torrents of mud and earth swept through the town of Aab Barik in Badakshan province in north eastern Afghanistan on Friday.

The deadly landslides, which followed days of heavy rain, also left 4,000 people requiring shelter and food. The DFID team is providing the homeless with tents, clean water and medical supplies.

Shovelling: Desperate villagers kept up the search after official rescuers turned their attention to helping survivors

International Development Secretary 
Justine Greening said last night: ‘It is clear there has been 
significant loss of life and many people are in need of emergency 
relief.

‘Response teams are working in extremely difficult conditions and I pay tribute to their brave efforts.’

Britain
 has provided £10 million to a United Nations Common Humanitarian Fund 
which is used to purchase emergency supplies and equipment after natural
 disasters.

Eye witnesses 
described how two landslides struck Aab Barik in quick succession. The 
first slide, which was smaller, covered only a few houses. When people 
rushed to help, a second, bigger landslide came down, burying many more 
people.

Mohammad Seyas, 
deputy director of Afghanistan’s Natural Disaster Management Authority, 
added that efforts to find survivors were being hampered by weather 
conditions and a series of subsequent landslides in the same area.

As
 it is feared that most of the victims’ bodies will not be recovered, 
the site is likely to be declared a mass grave by the UN. A memorial 
service took place yesterday.

In
 addition to the military conflicts that cost thousands of Afghans their
 lives in recent years, the country has been subject to repeated 
disasters. In 2012, a landslide in Baghlan province in the same region 
killed 71 people. Authorities were not able to recover the vast majority
 of bodies then, and ended up declaring the site as a mass grave.

Path of destruction: The landslide, which took place yesterday morning in the Afghan village, destroyed hundreds of homes

Efforts: Heavy machinery was drafted in to pick away at the mud and rubble

Anguish: Villagers and relatives of those lost kept up the search

Local rescuers are pleading with the international community to send equipment such as shovels and machinery to help recover survivors

Local officials are still trying to establish the number of people missing or dead after this morning's landslide buried the village in the Badakhasan Province of Afghanistan

Before the disaster, an estimated 2,100 people lived in the village and a quarter of them are feared dead

Survivors of the disaster make their way from the village hit by the landslide which is feared to have claimed hundreds of lives

Wiped out: Hobo Barik, a village in Badakshan province, was hit by heavy rains, almost certainly killing 500 people
