Tom Cleverley part-exchanged his custom-engraved Manchester United watch – and you can buy it for £17,500.

The midfielder, who is on loan at Aston Villa from Old Trafford, sold his one-of-a-kind United timepiece to a pawnbroker in Blackpool.

Cleverley appears to have cashed in on the Hublot watch which is engraved with his name and United squad number of 23 after the Old Trafford club entered into a sponsorship deal with a different manufacturer, Bulova.

The Blackpool-based pawnbroker is looking to sell the watch for £17,500 and advertising it as the only one ever made.

Cleverley has been at Manchester United since he joined as an 11-year-old back in 2000, but looks like his career at Old Trafford may have come to an end after he signed for Villa on a season-long loan deal.

The midfielder has featured in five games for Villa this season – but only been on the winning side once, in his first game against Liverpool.
