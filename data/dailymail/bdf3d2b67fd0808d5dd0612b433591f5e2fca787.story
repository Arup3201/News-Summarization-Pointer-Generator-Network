Personal information belonging to the Secret Service's new director Julia Pierson has been hacked and published online according to new claims now under federal investigation.

The hacking would be the latest in a string of such incidents against top officials that include first lady Michelle Obama and CIA Director John Brennan.

The information on the website included a
 Social Security number, phone numbers, and a credit report that 
includes accounts with The Home Depot, Sears, and Macy's.

Hacked: Julia Pierson, seen after being sworn-in as the new director of the U.S. Secret Service late last month, has allegedly been hacked with her private information published online

It was unclear how much of the data that appeared on www.exposed.re was accurate or who posted it.

The website appeared to have information about other government officials and celebrities that had been published online previously at another Internet address, www.exposed.su.

That address appears to have been taken down after its launch last month.

In that one-month period the former site was viewed more than a half a million times, Information Week reports. The latest site reports more than 770,000 page views and counting.

'We are investigating and we are aware of the matter,' a Secret Service spokesman said without commenting further.

Creeper: The website, pictured, claims to also have the information of national players like Hillary Clinton, John Brennan and stars like Kim Kardashian

Pierson was sworn into office on March 27 and is the first woman to head the agency which protects the president.

An FBI spokeswoman said 'we're aware of the reports' but she would not say whether the FBI was investigating them.

The Internet domain country code for the island of Reunion is .re, while .su was the domain code for the Soviet Union.
