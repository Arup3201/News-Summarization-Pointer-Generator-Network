This is the gut-wrenching moment a scooter driver was thrown through the air upside down when he strayed into the wrong lane and was hit head-on by an oncoming car.

Chen Chao, 62, was turning off a bridge when he accidentally rode the wrong way past some lane dividers and smashed into the front of a Mercedes in north Taiwan's New Taipei City. 

The biker was rushed to hospital with severe internal injuries after hitting the saloon car as it came onto the bridge.

The nasty crash was captured on the dashboard camera of the Mercedes, driven by Chiang Hu, 49.

Everything appears normal in the footage until a scooter can be seen swinging round the yellow dividers and heading straight for the car.

The rider apparently does not realise the imminent danger he is in and  seems not to break before seconds later he rams into the front of the Mercedes at some speed.

The force of the impact completely pole-axes him and his legs are thrown into the air as he is flipped over, landing on top of his battered scooter.

Mr Hu called for an ambulance, and rescuers arrived to take Mr Chao to hospital.

The Mercedes driver told police he had not time to brake

Paramedic Chi Kung said: 'We noticed that the injured man had very low vital signs at the scene of the accident, and we feared he might not make the trip into the emergency room. 

'However he survived the trip to hospital and is now on the way to recovery.'

Medics said the main injury was internal bleeding which they had managed to stop, saving Mr Chao's life in the process.
