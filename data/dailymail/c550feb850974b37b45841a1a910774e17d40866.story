These images capture the world's most famous nightclub Studio 54 during its 33-month existence, populated by celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Rod Stewart and Andy Warhol.

The wild success of the 70s New York club has forever been put down to owner Steve Rubell's first rule of partying: 'The key to a good party is filling a room with guests more interesting than you.'

By 1978, within a year of transforming it from a theatre to a nightclub, Studio 54 had made $7million and Rubell was quoted as saying 'only the Mafia made more money.'

A born and bred New Yorker, Rubell was said to guard the club's door like his life depended on it, letting in only those he considered glamourous enough.

It soon developed a reputation for being the world's most exclusive, hardest to get in to nightspot.

He forever sought the perfect 
combination of black and white, straight and gay, - something he called 'mixing
 the salad' and would tell people to go home and change or rather more bluntly 'you're ugly, you're not coming in.'

He started with his business partner Ian Shrager, a more introverted, business-minded type with a chain of steakhouses in the 1970s in the less salubrious parts of New York.

The soon realised that by cutting back on the food and concentrating on the sale of alcohol, their profits would soar.

They bought a building at 254 W. 54th St. in New York and spent $400,000 on turning it into a nightclub that included a huge man-in-the-moon hanging over the dance floor. When a large hanging spoon came to rest under its nose, the man-in-the-moon lit up.

They named the club Studio 54, and the doors opened on April 16, 1977.

One strategy to ensure the A-list celebrities would return time after time was to lavish them with gifts and attention.

For Bianca Jagger's 30th birthday, a costumed show was performed by staff and professional dancers, and right at the end, Ms Jagger came riding out on the stage on a white horse.

For Andy Warhol's birthday Rubell was said to be so unsure as to what best to get him he ended up presenting the artist with a metal bin full of dollar bills.

Legend has it that Warhol said it was the best present he had ever had.

The music finally stopped on December 1979 when the club was raided by the Inland Revenue and bags full of money were found stashed throughout the building.

A final party and prison send-off was held in February 1980, and Diana Ross serenaded Rubell and Shrager in front of a packed crowd that included Richard Gere, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone and Gia Carangi.

The pair were sentenced to three-and-a-half years for tax evasion of which they served 13 months atfer striking a deal with prosecutors.

After all this time, Shrager still finds the 33-month period difficult to talk about.

In a 2011 interview he said: 'I didn't handle the success well; there was nothing you could do at night in the 1970s you couldn't walk away from in the morning.

'I admire the accomplishment at a distance - we were a couple of guys from Brooklyn - but we created a Frankenstein monster that almost destroyed us.'

Steve Rubell died of hepatitis and septic shock in 1989. Ian Shrager went into the boutique hotel business and sold his company, Morgans Hotel Group, the most famous hotel group in the world at the time, for a reputed $400 million in 2005.
