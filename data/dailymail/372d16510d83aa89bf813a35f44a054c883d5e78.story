Eve Branson, the 90-year-old mother of billionaire Sir Richard, has denied being saved from an inferno on her son's private Caribbean island by film star Kate Winslet.

In August 2011 it was widely reported that Titanic star Kate had rescued Eve as she tottered down stairs at Necker Island, picking her up in her arms and carrying her to safety, after a lightning storm caused a huge blaze.

But, in an interview with The Observer Magazine today Eve dismisses the heroic act, saying that Kate only carried her down four steps and ‘that was it.’

She said it was actually her grandsons that saved her.

‘It was the hurricane of hurricanes and we were on fire and we would have all been burnt alive if it wasn't for my grandsons,’ she said.

‘It was four or five in the morning and they went around getting everyone out of bed.

‘I remember saying, “I'd better put my mac on,” because I wanted to cover up and Jack [Eve’s grandson] saying “No, not right now.”

‘I'd just about got outside and the rain was pouring down and I didn't have my contact lenses in, but I was making my way out and Kate and her two children were behind me.

‘She just sort of picked me up and took me down four steps and that was it.’

 said she was ‘a bit slow’ for Kate, who gave birth to her third child

Paradise: Necker island in the Caribbean, owned by Sir Richard Branson, costs £1,000 per person per night

Sir Richard Branson, who is worth nearly £4bn, owns the luxurious Caribbean island. The entire island operates like a resort and can accommodate up to 28 guests.

Sir Richard, 61, was staying in a villa about 100 yards away with his wife Joan and son Sam, 25, when the fire took place.

However Holly, 29, Kate and her family were staying with Eve in the Great House, which was burned to the ground.

The Virgin tycoon praised Miss Winslet for helping his mother to safety, and described the actress's children Mia, ten, and seven-year-old Joe as 'two of the bravest kids I've ever come across'.

Eve Branson previously said how she, ‘would have got down those stairs all right on my own,’ and that Kate only picked her up because she was worried about her own kids.

Eve said: ‘I think she was worried that I was holding up her children, so she picked me up and carried me.’

As reported in The Observer Magazine, Eve has been running the Eve Branson Foundation in Morocco for the past 16 years, helping local women in the villages of the Atlas Mountains to set up sustainable enterprises making craft items for sale.

‘I'm completely in love with Morocco,’ Eve told the magazine. ‘And these women, they've never really had the chance to make their own money. Up to the time I took them on, they had nothing - not even transport, they couldn't get anywhere.’
