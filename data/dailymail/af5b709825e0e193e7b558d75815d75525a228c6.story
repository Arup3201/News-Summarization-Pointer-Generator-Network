Pampered: Liverpudlian model Abbey Clancy sports the city's famed look

Liverpool has been named as Britain's most pampered city as scousers spent the most on beautifying themselves in the past year.

It's perhaps unsurprising given the city is home to glamorous Wags including Coleen Rooney and Abbey Crouch, while Kim Cattrall also hails from Liverpool.

The Merseyside city was closely followed in the poll by Edinburgh, with Manchester coming in third.

Londoner came in fourth while another Scottish city, Glasgow, came fifth.

Researchers ranked the UK's top ten most pampered cities according to how much they've spent on beauty treatments this year.

The PromotionalCodes.org.uk study was based on the number of online vouchers and discounts used per head for each city.

Liverpool topped the list, with scousers splashing out the most on pampering treatments.

Researchers were also able to break the results down to identify the areas where certain beauty treatments were the most popular.

Chelmsford came out as the teeth-whitening capital of the UK, whereas Newcastle was the top spot for fake tans.

Birmingham topped the list for hair colouring whilst Glasgow was the number one place for tattoo removal. 

People
 in Leeds spent more on getting their nails done than in other cities, 
whereas Edinburgh took the number one spot for waxing.

One woman from Liverpool said: 'It's great to think that I live in the UK's most pampered city.

'People 
round here do spend a lot on beauty treatments. If they're not having 
their teeth whitened, they're having a fake tan or getting waxed.

'I
 probably spend between £50 and £60 per month on my beauty regime but 
that can shoot up to well over £100 if I'm getting my hair coloured.'

But it's not just the women splashing out. One male Liverpudlian added: 'It's frightening to see how much some men are forking out on beauty treatments.

'Some of my mates are even spending as much as their girlfriends.

'Me, I'm just content with a trip down the barbers, a nice smelling aftershave and a good bar of soap.'

A spokesperson from PromotionalCodes.org.uk said: 'It was really interesting to see which UK city spent the most per head on beauty treatments and products.

'Liverpool will no longer just be associated with The Beatles, it will be recognised nationally as our country's most pampered city as well. 

'Beauty regimes are expensive so using voucher sites is one of the best ways of keeping the price down.'
