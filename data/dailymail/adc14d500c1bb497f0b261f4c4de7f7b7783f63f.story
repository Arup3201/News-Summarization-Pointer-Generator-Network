Victim: Baraa escaped serious injury after she was pulled from rubble in the war torn town of Daraya, near Damascus

A teenager who was crushed under a bombed building for 11 hours in Syria was pulled from the rubble alive with miraculously minor injuries.

Baraa, whose name means 'Innocence' in Arabic, was dug out by her neighbours with scrapes, bruises, a bloody nose and a broken arm.

Her and her mother lived in Daraya, a town south of Damascus which has seen bitter fighting between President Bashar al-Assad's forces and rebel fighters owing to the government ministries and military airport based there.

Assad's army has spent weeks trying to stamp out the Syrian Kurds Opposition fighters who are working in the town undercover.

Baraa and her mother had decided to hide away when they heard Assad's army was advancing, and they and 29 other people - including her three younger siblings - sought protection in a basement in a building in town.

In a video posted by opposition activists on YouTube, she told medics: 'Some people told us that the structure of the building was not that strong. But we stayed there for three days.'

After 36 hours of rocket attacks, a government warplane soared over the town and dropped a barrel bomb on Baraa's refuge.

She said: 'The last thing I saw was a red flash like fire. After that it was complete darkness.

'I was hardly breathing.'

Baraa's mother survived, but her siblings aged 11, nine and two all died in the attack.

The youngster was afterwards treated by paramedics, who are seen in the video clearing debris from her nose and throat.

According to opposition network the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, 183 people died in the war on Friday, and a further 70 this morning.

The fighting continues as opposition leaders have launched their second bid to form a transitional
government.

It is hoped agreement among the 70-member National Coalition, an umbrella group for the Syrian opposition with western and Gulf backing, could help address international concern about the organisation's lack of unity.

Leading opposition campaigner Kamal 
al-Labwani, a member of the coalition, said the group needed at least to
name a prime minister to be a credible alternative to four decades of 
family rule by Assad and his late father, President Hafez al-Assad.

'The
coalition is a legislature and we need an executive. There have been 
lots of mistakes and the people we are supposed to represent inside feel
marginalised,' he said.

He said he would nominate former Prime 
Minister Riad Hijab, the highest-ranking official to defect since the 
revolt, to be the next transitional premier.

Dismissing concerns among the opposition that Hijab had served Assad, Labwani said: 'I am not sure what the problem is. 
Hijab is qualified and is now serving the revolution. We have already 
hundreds of defectors in the Free Syrian army.'

Another possible contender is Asaad Mustafa, who left Syria after a stint as agriculture minister under Hafez al-Assad.

But coalition member Abdul Ahad 
Astephoa, one of three Christians in the group, said there were larger 
issues to be resolved first.

'We have already received many 
promises that once we unite we will get international support. Very 
little came and the international community, sadly, is not ready to end 
the Assad regime,' he said.

'If we form a government we have to 
make sure first it will receive international recognition, have enough 
financing and be able to operate in the liberated areas of Syria,' he 
added.

The United Nations estimates 60,000 people have been killed in Syria's 22-month conflict. 

In the latest massacre, more than 100 Sunni men, women and children were overran in an opposition-held district in the city of Homs on Tuesday, according to opposition campaigners.

The killing occurred around the same time a disputed attack killed and wounded dozens of people at Aleppo University, a hotbed of peaceful demonstrations at the start of the revolt.
