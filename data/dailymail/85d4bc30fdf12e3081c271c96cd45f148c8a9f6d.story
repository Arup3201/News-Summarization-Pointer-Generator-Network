An arrest has finally been made in the unsolved 2009 theft of a family caravan after an 11-year-old boy spotted a potential suspect on Google Street View.

A picture taken by the street-level imaging site shows a mystery figure lurking on the family's driveway at about the time the white Abbey Aventura holiday vehicle vanished.

Surveyor David Soanes, 47, and wife Rebecca, 42, hoped for a breakthrough after their son Reuben stumbled across the image in March 2010 while he and his schoolfriends surfed Street View to find pictures of their homes.

Hopeful: Rebecca and David Soanes and their children Reuben and Lauren are hoping this Google image will lead to a conviction in the unsolved theft of their caravan

They immediately informed police probing the theft in Linton, Derbyshire, but much to their frustration Google initially refused a request to un-blur the number plate on the suspect's 4x4 - making it far harder to trace him.

The internet giant finally released the unblurred images in the beginning of 2011 - but by then the car had been sold on.

This week officers finally arrested a man at Corley motorway services, on the M6 outside Coventry, using information gleaned from the Street View image.

A spokesperson for Derbyshire Police 
said: 'A man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and he has since 
been released on police bail.'

Refused: Google stalled on a request to un-blur a picture taken by a street-mapping car that police hoped would identify the culprit behind the theft of a caravan like the one pictured, right

The theft happened in June 2009 after Mr Soanes left the family home for just one hour.

He said: 'It was alarmed, was wheelclamped and was positioned so that a number of people would have had to move it to get it off the drive - I thought it was secure.'

The Soanes left the investigation in the hands of police but thought they would never hear about the stolen caravan again.

Then, while Reuben, now 14, was searching the internet with friends at school and locating their houses on Google, he spotted the alleged thief.

David said: 'Reuben came home and told us what he'd seen. We all had a look and you could tell it must have been the day that the theft happened - we had never seen that man or his car before.

'We passed the image on to the police who have since been looking for the man pictured.'

Blurred out: Number plates on mystery man's 4x4 were fuzzed out in original Google images 

Google's stance baffled the family 
and left police struggling for leads as the thief left behind few 
clues aside from the discarded wheel clamps that had been used to secure
 the caravan.

 Adrian Mason, who was investigating the theft at the time, said: 'It was an amazing
 coincidence that the Google Earth car was passing at that time.

'I’ve
 made extensive inquiries since the image was discovered but because the
 registration plate of the 4x4 is blanked out we have been unable to 
trace the man through his car.'

A
 Google spokesman said: 'It’s very important to Google and our users 
that we only provide information if valid process is followed, as laid 
down by governments in law.

'We have a team specifically trained to evaluate and respond to requests when they are received, and we will of course co-operate with police requests as long as they are legally valid and follow the correct processes.'

The Information Commissioner’s Office said it could not comment on individual cases but a spokeswoman added that the Data Protection Act did not prohibit a company passing on information if it was related to the investigation of a crime.

The picture was taken by one of Google’s specially adapted cars that travel the world taking pictures. These are then uploaded to the internet, allowing users to see panoramic views of streets.
