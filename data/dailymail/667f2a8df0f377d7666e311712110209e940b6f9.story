The inaugural Tour of Yorkshire has been confirmed on the UCI calendar for next May after the county's successful staging of the 2014 Tour de France Grand Depart.

The three-day race will be run by Welcome to Yorkshire - the organisation that brought the Tour to the UK for a fourth time - and Amaury Sports Organisation, the organisers of the Tour.

The race was announced on the eve of the Tour start in Leeds in July, but has now been officially signed off by the UCI, cycling's world governing body, at meetings held during the Road World Championships in Ponferrada, Spain.

Fans lined the streets in their thousands when the Tour de France came to Yorkshire this summer

Princes William and Harry and Kate Middleton were all in Harrogate to see the Tour get underway

It will take place between May 1st and 3rd, and the organisers are hoping to draw some of the biggest names in the sport.

The Tour de France began in Yorkshire on July 5 this year and the Leeds to Harrogate route saw thousands of fans turn out for cycling's biggest race. 

The huge support in Yorkshire has been a major boost for the county's inaugural tour
