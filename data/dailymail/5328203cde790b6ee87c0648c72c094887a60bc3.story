Winter storm Linus was progressing across the Northeast today after tearing through the Ohio Valley into Pennsylvania and western New York state overnight. 

More than 3,600 flights had been canceled on Monday due to snowstorms and high winds in the Northeast and close to 3,500 flights have been delayed.
