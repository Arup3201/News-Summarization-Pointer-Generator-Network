A New York couple who lost everything to Superstorm Sandy were in anything but good hands when they relied on insurance from Allstate, which then featured their destroyed house in a TV ad.

Like many other families on Staten Island, Dominic and Sheila Traina are struggling since they were forced to vacate their home in New Dorp Beach when Sandy struck in late October.

When the home that they have lived in for more than 40 years was rendered unlivable, they turned to Allstate, their insurance provider that they had used since they moved into the house.

Despair: Like many other families on Staten Island, Dominic and Sheila Traina are struggling since they were forced to vacate their home when Sandy struck in late October

Salvaging memories: Members of the Traina family sort through photos and other personal items they found in the remains of the Staten Island home

The Staten Island Advance reported that their high hopes were dashed when they received only a $10,000 check, a payment they refused because it wasn't enough to help them rebuild.

And if that wasn't enough, Allstate then featured the Trainas' destroyed home in a television ad.

The couple told the New York Post that they were sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner when the saw the TV spot that included two photos of their home - and they saw it as a smack in the face.

Sheila Traina told the paper: 'It made us sick and angry.'

Ad blitz: The ad thanks the company's 1,000 agents living in the path of the storm, who 'put their customers first' despite having their own storm-related troubles

The ad, narrated by longtime Allstate
spokesman and Major League star Dennis Haysbert, thanks the company's 
1,000 agents living in the path of the storm, who 'put their customers 
first' despite having their own storm-related troubles.

Mrs Traina told the Advance: 'The commercial said how caring their agents are, but they are not caring at all.'

Since the storm recovery began, the couple emerged as faces of the desperation continuing to be felt in the areas hardest-hit by Sandy. Even Barack Obama visited during his tour of the region.

The president viewed letters written by the couple's grandchildren, begging for his help.

The Trainas claim that their home was 
destroyed by wind - which would have entitled them to a much higher sum 
of money - and not the storm surge.

What now? The couple now lives in a basement apartment provided by relatives, while they contemplate their next move

They are thinking about taking the 
matter to court.

Allstate contends that it is
still working with the couple to establish an agreeable payment.

Jaclyn Darrohn, senior manager of corporate relations for the New York region, told the Advance: 'Our commitment is always to settle claims fairly.'

But will it be enough?

Mrs Traina told the paper: 'We really 
love the neighborhood, but it needs to be made safe for people if they 
are to come back, but I don’t know that we can afford to go back.'
