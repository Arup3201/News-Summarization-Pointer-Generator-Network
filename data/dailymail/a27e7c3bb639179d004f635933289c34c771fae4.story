An enormous fatberg of built-up grease from takeaways and rubbish on one of Britain's busiest party streets has been found. 

The 3ft-wide mass was blocking sewers beneath Mill Lane in Cardiff, a popular nightlife spot with scores of fast food restaurants. 

Photographs taken by a camera robot sent underground to investigate the water blockage revealed the buildup which has likened to Jabba the Hutt.

The 3ft-wide mass also contained make-up and nappy wipes. It had been blocking water flow beneath the busy city centre street

Alongside congealed fat from kebabs and burgers were wet-wipes, nappies and chewing gum. 

Passers-by used to spending their nights in the street's many clubs and bars were horrified to see what had been beneath their dancing feet. 

Office worker Michelle Morgan, 24, said: 'That is just so disgusting. It is horrible to think that is just lying there.

'It just shows that all the fat and rubbish has to go somewhere. I’ll never eat another kebab here again!.'

Shopper Adrian Smith, 27, added: 'It looks like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars mixed with a rancid mountain of lard. It is appalling.'

Welsh Water urged revellers not to throw litter in the street or down toilets and sinks to avoid such blockages

Welsh Water, who claim to spend millions every year removing waste from sewers, encouraged revellers not throw rubbish down their sinks and toilets.

'It is pretty disgusting. In Cardiff alone, 80 tonnes of rubbish including dental floss, chewing gum, nappies and plasters are removed from sewers every month,' a spokesman said. 

'We want to change customer behaviour when it comes to putting things down the toilet and disposing of fat, oils and grease.' 

Among the most common causes of drain blockages are make-up and nappy wipes, fat and grease, chewing gum, dental floss, plasters and building debris. 

Over the festive period waste experts warned against pouring turkey and goose fat down kitchen sinks. 

It came after a 15-tonne fatberg was found in London in 2013. A sewage worker took three weeks to clear the mass which threatened to spill out onto streets.  

Mill Lane in Cardiff is one of the city's busiest partying streets, with scores of fast food restaurants serving drunken late-night customers regularly
