A racist drunk who was filmed ranting at a Japanese woman on the Underground was jailed today after celebrities, including Ricky Gervais, retweeted the video.

Keith Hurdle, admitted shouting verbal abuse at HR worker Kuniko Ingram, yelling at her: 'You’re a vicious bunch of f****** c***s'.

He was arrested after a commuter filmed the scene on his mobile phone and posted it on YouTube where it went viral.

But the passenger only posted the footage after twice trying to report it to police only to find the police stations closed.

Vile: Hurdle singles out HR worker Kuniko Ingram because she is Japanese and begins to hurl abuse

Sitting in the dock wearing a tweed jacket and dark rimmed glasses, Hurdle looked down at the floor when he was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. He will serve half the time on licence.

The 52 year-old had earlier held his head in his hands as the racist video was played at Westminster Magistrates Court.

But the passenger only posted the footage after twice trying to report it to police only to find the police stations closed.

Sitting in the dock wearing a tweed jacket and dark rimmed glasses, Hurdle looked down at the floor when he was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. He will serve half the time on licence.

The 52 year-old had earlier held his head in his hands as the racist video was played at Westminster Magistrates Court.

In the five minute clip, Hurdle claims his uncle died in the World War 2 in Japan, yelling at Mrs Ingram: 'You tortured him.

'Get yourself off the train, get yourself off the train. You’re nasty people, yeah? F*** off, get out of my country. Sayonara'.

Boozed-up Hurdle then turns to the passenger filming the incident and slurs 'Where are you from?'

The film maker, named in court as Mr Ali, tries to help the woman by saying to Hurdle, 'Does it matter, really? 

'Are you going to start sorting everyone on the train, man, one by one? What have you got against the Japanese?”

In reply Hurdle, from Watford, north west London, brandishes a wine bottle he has been swigging from and says: 'Do you want some of that? No, because you don’t drink. You’re a f****** Somalian c**t'.

Hurdle, who had been boozing while watching the England football match before the rant on October 15, then tells the tube carriage that he used to be a soldier with the Parachute Regiment and served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands.

Mrs Ingram told police that Hurdle had been 'mumbling' comments about the number of Chinese people in Britain.

She became scared when he turned his attention to her, accusing the HR officer of not being able to read a paper.

She said: 'At this point I felt chills down my spine and I was fearful because I was becoming a target of his abuse.

Out of order: Hurdle said he disliked Japanese people because his grandfather had been killed in World War 2

'Then he asked "Where are you from?", I said "I’m from Japan".

'He said something like ‘Go back to your country’.

'He began shouting very loudly f***ing c***s and making gestures with his hands.

'He said: 'The Japanese are f***ing c***s and then said the Japanese are nasty people.”

Another woman then approached Mrs Ingram and advised her to get off the train for her own safety, but Hurdle continued spouting abuse at her.

After Mrs Ingram got off, Hurdle began hurling abuse at a man sat opposite him, Mr Ali, who had been filming the rant on his iphone.

When Mr Ali challenged Hurdle’s abusive language, he lent forward and snarled 'Don’t give it all that, I’ll knock you out in one punch.'

In a statement read in court, Mr Ali said: 'He lent towards me with his fist clenched and I thought he was going to punch me.

'He then continued shouting at me. He grabbed a wine bottle, took a sip and then closed it. He held it upside down, at this point I thought he was going to bottle me.

Hurdle was tracked down and arrested after the YouTube clip when viral. 

When he was interviewed by police, Hurdle apologised and said he did not remember the incident because he had been so drunk.

He told cops at the station: 'I was drinking, I do not recall anything about the exchange of words on the train and I would like to apologise to those concerned.'

The court heard that Hurdle has been an alcoholic since the mid 1990’s when he turned to booze after his mum was diagnosed with cancer.

Threat: Hurdle told the film maker he would 'knock him out in one punch' while brandishing a wine bottle

His drink problem led to the break up of his marriage and him losing his job, the court heard.

Chairwoman of the bench Jane Hepburn sentencing him to 12 weeks in prison to two counts causing harassment alarm or distress - one being racially aggravated.

Turning to Hurdle, she said: 'These offences are of an extremely unpleasant nature, and committed on public transport against lone passengers within the confines of an underground train.

'It was aggressive and prolonged and we feel it passes the custody threshold.'
