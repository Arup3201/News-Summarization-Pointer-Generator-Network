The Dallas Cowboys player accused of vehicular manslaughter was released from jail yesterday after posting bond - one day after the car crash that killed a fellow player.

As he stepped out of the Irving City Jail, defensive tackle Josh Brent said he was 'just trying to deal' with the death of his teammate and 'very best friend' Jerry Brown.

'Jerry Brown was my very best friend, and I'm just trying to deal with his death right now,' Brent said, stopping briefly when asked if he had anything to say to Brown's family.

He would not answer any other questions.

Brent was behind the wheel of a 2007 Mercedes-Benz at about 2:20am on Saturday when the vehicle veered off the road, flipped at least once and slid about 900 feet.

Brent has allegedly been speeding before the accident, which occurred hours before the team was due to fly to Cincinnati for Sunday's game against the Bengals.

NFL.com reported that the car was on fire when police arrived, and officers spotted Brent pulling Brown out of the mangled car.

Brown, a practice-squad linebacker who also was Brent's teammate for three seasons at the University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the scene and pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

Attorney George Milner bemoaned the fact that Brent's bond was set '16 times higher than it would have been for 
anybody that doesn't play for the Dallas Cowboys.'

'He is torn up,' Milner said. 'It's not a good moment for anyone. I'm going to take him home. He needs family around him.'

Meanwhile, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported
that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission would be investigating the
club where several Cowboys may have been before the crash.

The agency said it would be interviewing other clubgoers, bartenders and any other witnesses.

Release: Brent did not answer questions from reporters as he walked out of the Irving City Jail 

If it is found that players were served alcohol while visibly intoxicated, the club could be subject to heavy fines and face the loss of its liquor license.

TABC spokeswoman Carolyn Beck told the Star-Telegram: 'We're establishing where [the players] had been and if they were sold alcohol while they were drunk.'

The club was not immediately identified, but reports indicated that it was Privae Dallas, where comedian Shawn Wayans was performing on Friday night.

The Cowboys bowed their heads in a moment of silence for Brown before their game against the Bengals yesterday - the second straight weekend that an NFL game was preceded by tragedy.

Last week, Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend before committing suicide in front of his coach and general manager at the team's stadium. 

Second tragedy: Dallas Cowboys players hang their heads during a moment of silence today honoring teammate Jerry Brown who was killed in an accident last night. Lineman Josh Brent has been charged with DUI manslaughter

Irving police said the accident 
happened about 2:20am on Saturday, hours before Brent was to be on a 
team flight to Cincinnati. He was reportedly speeding and hit a curb, 
flipping the car

Before the game, the Bengals held a 
moment of silence before the national anthem. Most Cowboys bowed their 
heads, and Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and several other players had 
their hands over their hearts.

On Fox's NFL Sunday show, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team had focused on Brown's death in the 'last few hours.' He didn't mention Brent.

'First of all we all know, but we remind ourselves that there is something more important than football, and this is life, and certainly the lost life of Jerry,' Jones said on the TV show.

'On the other hand, they know the best way they can honor Jerry, because he was such a hard worker, so conscientious and enthusiastic about his career.'

Best friends: Brent is charged with intoxication manslaughter that resulted in the death of his passenger and teammate whom he's since called his best friend

Reality check: Brent's charge of intoxication manslaughter is a second-degree felony that's punishable by two to 20 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000

Officers conducted a field sobriety 
test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while 
intoxicated, Argumaniz said. The charge, a second-degree felony 
punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was 
pronounced dead.

In February 2009, Brent was arrested 
in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the 
influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to 
Champaign County, Illinois, court records.

In June 2009, Brent pleaded guilty to
DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 
hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000.

As part of his 
plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid 
driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 
2011, court records show.

Dallas Cowboys' Josh Price- Brent (pictured in Jan. 2012) is facing an intoxication manslaughter charge after a one-vehicle accident that killed linebacker Jerry Brown, a member of the team's practice squad

Brent, a nose tackle, has played in 
all 12 games this season and played a bigger role than expected with 
starter Jay Ratliff battling injuries.

He has 35 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks
and would most likely have started Sunday against the Bengals because Ratliff is 
out with a groin injury.

The Cowboys signed Brown to their 
practice squad on October 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster.

He was 
released from the Colts' on October 20.

Brown was originally from St. Louis. He had been a defensive lineman at the University of Illinois, where  Price- Brent had been his teammate.

According
to local reports, Brent had been jailed for misdemeanor DUI when he was
a student-athlete at the University of Illinois in 2009.

Scene of the crime: Tire ruts mark the area where Brent lost control of the car

Irving Police Department Public Information Officer John Argumaniz said Jerry Brown, 25, was found unresponsive at the scene and pronounced dead at a hospital

He was given two years of probation and 60 days in jail as part of a plea deal for the at incident.

The Cowboys were preparing to fly to Cincinnati on Saturday for a Sunday game against the 
Bengals, when the team was told of the news, according to ESPN.

The players were told on the plane just 
before takeoff of what happened after non-team personnel were asked to 
go outside.

This marks a second time that a Cowboys player has been involved in a fatal car crash.

In 2003, Dwayne Goodrich, a second-round pick in 2000, was involved in a hit-and-run accident in which two people were killed.

Goodrich was convicted of two counts of criminally negligent homicide and was released from prison in October 2011.
