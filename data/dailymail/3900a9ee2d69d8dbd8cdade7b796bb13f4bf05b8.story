It sounds like a fanciful storyline from Radio 4’s soap The Archers.

A farmer’s wife sets up a campaign against her husband’s plan to erect 40,000 solar panels on their land, and even threatens to leave him.

However, this everyday tale of country folk is not fiction but a real-life marital dispute between Sue Young, 69, and her husband Robert, 70.

At war: Farmer's wife Sue Young has threatened to leave her husband Robert if his plans to install 40,000 solar panels on their land is approved - and she's been rallying the locals for support

She is so appalled by the farmer’s planning application to create a 55-acre solar farm that she has written an open letter to villagers asking them to join her fight against the proposal.

It echoes a current storyline in The Archers in which long-suffering wife Jennifer Aldridge has angered her greedy farmer husband Brian by going to a public meeting about a controversial new road he supports.

But Mrs Young appears to be taking matters considerably more seriously, not only spearheading the campaign against her husband’s plan with a solar power firm, but threatening to leave him.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘My husband signed the deal without telling me. I was killing myself working 20 hours a day lambing and he conducted the negotiation behind my back.

‘We live in a beautiful valley and we won’t be able to see it if there are solar panels surrounded by 8ft-high fences. And it may all go out of fashion. It’s not been a happy situation – I’d like to kill him. I’ve not kicked him out of the bedroom, though. We’re too old for all that anyway.’

Sue Young has written an open letter to the people of Lingfield asking them to back her in her fight to oppose the plans by her husband Robert to erect the 55-acre solar farm on the family land

Mr Young said last night his wife’s stance had caused trouble for the whole family and left him deeply upset.

The row has divided the village of Lingfield in Surrey, where the Youngs run Barrow Green Farm. Mr Young says he wants to build a secure financial future for his children and grandchildren with the solar panel scheme, which would supposedly provide enough energy for 3,500 households over at least 30 years.

It is claimed it could earn £55,000 a year in government subsidies alone, but Mrs Young is bitterly opposed to it.

Despite seeking the help of a cardiologist for angina since the proposals came to light, she insists she is determined to fight the plans. In an open letter to the East Grinstead Courier, her local newspaper, she thanked those supporting the campaign against ‘this potential blight to our countryside’ and urged villagers to write to Piers Mason, the chief planning officer at Tandridge district council.

She wrote: ‘I am still asking myself: “What have I done to lead my husband to put money before our marriage?”

Over the course of a year, the solar panels on Park Farm, next to the Young's family home on Barrow Green Farm, would generate enough renewable energy to power 3,500 houses (stock picture)

I’m married to my husband. But I am my own person. All the stress has made me quite ill, but everyone I meet says it’s fabulous that I’m sticking to my beliefs. If the solar farm goes ahead, I’ve told him I’ll leave.’

She noted that three of their four grown-up children, who have all left home, were not interested in taking over the farm. Mrs Young said: ‘Only my daughter Louise is interested. She comes down from Cheshire to help me with the lambing.’

Mr Young, meanwhile, insisted the children supported his scheme and said it made financial sense.

He said: ‘The whole thing has caused trouble in the family. It has been very stressful. I don’t want to upset her any more than she wants to upset me.

‘It was never my intention to cause friction. It’s a business decision that the farm needs to make for future generations. It will also be wildlife friendly.’

He added: ‘I don’t know whether Sue will leave me if the plan goes ahead or not. I would not have undertaken this decision if I didn’t have the backing or interest of my children.

‘But Sue is against it. She thinks she will be able to see it from her bedroom window and it will spoil her view.’

Other locals opposing the scheme include former Formula One world champion John Surtees, whose house overlooks the proposed solar farm.

He said: ‘I’ve been approached by solar companies wanting to build solar farms on my land, but on principle I am against commercial ventures on fields which could be used as farmland.’
