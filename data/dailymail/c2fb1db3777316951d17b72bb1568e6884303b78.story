An Iraq War veteran pleaded
guilty on Friday to charges of running into the White House
armed with a knife before being tackled, a security breach that
helped lead to a shake-up in the U.S. Secret Service.

Omar Gonzalez of Copperas Cove, Texas, was charged with climbing over the White House
fence on September 19 and racing across the north lawn.

He now faces up to ten years in prison for illegal entry charge and eight years for an assault accusation, plus $3,000 to $30,000 in fines.

During his rampage, Gonzalez burst through the front door of the White House and reached as far as the executive mansion's East Room before Secret Service agents subdued him.

During his court hearing on Friday, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer asked
Gonzalez, who was dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit: 'Are you guilty?

'Yes, yes, your honor,' the suspect replied.

He gave his age as 43, though prosecutors had said
he was 42.

Gonzalez was carrying a folding knife when he was arrested
and told a Secret Service agent that he needed to tell President
Barack Obama that the atmosphere was collapsing.

The Obamas were
not in the White House when the incident occurred.

Gonzalez, who has no prior convictions and suffers from
post-traumatic stress disorder, pleaded guilty to federal
charges of illegal entry with a dangerous weapon and assault on
a federal officer.

Gonzalez made it all the way to the East Room of the first floor of the White House on September 19 after he got past five rings of security and sprinted across the 70-yard front lawn – only being apprehended because an off-duty Secret Service agent was present

Collyer said prosecutors and the defense had agreed that
sentencing guidelines called for 12 to 18 months in prison and
possible fines. Sentencing is set for June 8.

Gonzalez will also undergo supervised release after he
leaves prison, and conditions include avoiding contact with the
Secret Service, Collyer said.

The security breach was among a series of embarrassments for
the Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the president
and his family.

The agency's director stepped down in October.

In the most recent incident, two senior agents are under
investigation after driving a government car through an area at
the White House where colleagues were investigating a suspicious
package.

Michael McCaul, chairman of the House of Representatives
Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement the car crash
allegations added to incidents that had caused Americans to
question confidence in the agency.

But he said he was encouraged that the agency had asked the
Homeland Security Department's inspector general to investigate
the incident. 

'My committee will continue its oversight to help
restore the integrity of the Secret Service,' he said.
