SSP Raj Jit Singh Hundal is accused of forging his own death certificate

An Indian policeman faked his own death so his daughter could win a place at a medical school, the university has said.

Rajjit Singh Hundal's daughter was awarded a place at the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, in Punjab, through a scheme to help the children of police officers killed in riots or terrorist attacks.

But staff at the university uncovered the alleged fraud after his daughter Sukhmani supplied her father's death certificate during a 'counselling session.

The officer, who is currently posted as Senior Superintendent of Police in Taran Taran, is now facing charges for fraud.

He has also recently been awarded the President's Police Medal award for 'meritorious service', according to reports.

Punjab's home department has ordered an investigation into the alleged fraud.

SSP Hundal has denied all allegations and described the fake certificate as a 'goof up'.

He said: 'My mother and sister were killed by the terrorists in 1991.

'We were affected by terrorism.

'It is due to the certificate specimen provided in the university prospectus that the controversy took place. The language of the certificate is misleading.'

Under the government scheme two per cent of seats in educational institutions are reserved for the children of families of police affected by terrorism and riots.

According to The Telegraph, SSP Hundal has now been officially pronounced alive.

The university, meanwhile, has cancelled his daughter's admission after referring the matter to the authorities.

But SSP Hundal's police chief told the newspaper the officer's career is safe.

Deputy Inspector General S Paramraj said: 'He is a brilliant officer and has served the department for several decades.'
