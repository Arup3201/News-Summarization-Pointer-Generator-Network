A Melbourne woman who climbed into her unit garbage chute and fell to her death was in a sleepwalker-like state, a coroner has found.

Police determined Phoebe Handsjuk, 24, had committed suicide on December 2, 2010, but her family rejected that finding.

Ms Handsjuk was found dead beneath the chute in the luxury St Kilda Road unit complex where she lived with her partner, events promoter, Antony Hampel, some 20 years her senior, who is also the son of retired Victorian Supreme court justice, George Hampel. 

It has now emerged she suffered a 'catastrophic severance injury' to her lower right leg after falling down the chute,The Age reports.  

The tragic death of 24-year-old Phoebe Handsjuk was ruled to have been an accident

Coroner Peter White found Ms Handsjuk was in an alcohol and Stilnox sleeping pill stupor, or a 'state similar to that of sleepwalking', when she climbed into the chute and began climbing down.

He determined Ms Handsjuk's 'enthusiasm for climbing and penchant for physically challenging activity' had played a part in her descent down the chute.

But he categorically ruled out suicide or murder, saying no one had a motive for killing her.

Mr White said Ms Handsjuk's death was set against a backdrop of depression, talk of suicide, a troubled relationship with Mr Hampel and alcohol abuse.

He said she was either in an unconscious state with a level of motor control or deeply confused and unable to think rationally.

Either way, he determined she climbed into the chute without any awareness of the danger of her behaviour.

The Melbourne woman's body was discovered at the bottom of her luxury apartment building 

'The precise effect that (sleeping pills) and alcohol had upon her cannot be established to a great degree of certainty,' Mr White said.

'I am satisfied however that her use of these substances in combination did in fact impact upon her mental state in a significant way and directly led to her entry into the chute.'

He also said the cut to her leg was a major contributing factor to her death which occurred after she put a bag of rubbish in the chute first.

Mr White explained how a compactor in the garbage room almost removed her right foot and said she 'fought bravely' to escape. 

Handsjuk's grandfather, Lorne Campbell, conducted his own investigation into her death and said it was absurd to suggest she could have climbed into the garbage chute while intoxicated.

'It is my opinion ... that she was killed by one or more people,' the retired detective told the Victorian Coroners Court inquest in August.

A coroner ruled she climbed into the chute outside her 12th-floor apartment in an alcohol induced or sleepwalking-type state

But Mr White said the nature of her injuries suggested she climbed a significant way down the chute in a 'controlled passage'.

'The evidence does not suggest that she undertook this conduct either intending to end her own life or as the result of an assault by, or with the aid of, any other person,' he said.

Mr Hampel said in a statement on Wednesday: 'It was hard enough to lose Phoebe Handsjuk, who was a vibrant and loving young women in her mid-20s when she died four years ago, but it was even harder dealing with the false claims and totally unjustified allegations which followed.'

'These wild allegations have now been put to rest by the robust coroner's investigation and report handed down today. None of this will bring back Phoebe. My hope is that we can allow Phoebe to rest in peace,' he added. 

Ms Handsjuk was dating events promoter Antony Hampel at the time of her death. He said on Wednesday: 'My hope is that we can allow Phoebe to rest in peace'

Coroner White recommended that the dosage of Stilnox to female patients be reduced by 50 per cent.

He also recommended that Stilnox only be available in 5mg tablets in Australia, rather than both 5mg and 10mg forms. 

On a tribute website set up for Ms Handsjuk's family she is described as 'extremely sensitive, caring and compassionate. She was artistically gifted and creative. Strong willed, and often quick tempered, she had a cheeky, playful sense of humour.'

The article explains: 'Phoebe started experimenting with drugs at quite a young age. She struggled with alcohol and used it to overcome her anxieties. 

'She suffered from depression and was taking medication and seeking counselling to assist her.'
