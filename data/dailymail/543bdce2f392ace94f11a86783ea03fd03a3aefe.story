A couple had their prayers answered after they feared their white wedding would be put on ice because of the horrendous snow.

Their determined vicar rounded up an army of villagers to clear tons of snow so that their big day could go ahead.

Bride and groom Alison Jelley and Michael Roberts, both 26, woke up on their wedding day to discover 2ft of snow had fallen overnight.

Michael Roberts and Alison Jelley's white wedding went ahead - with the help of an army of volunteers armed with shovels

With a little help from their friends! Rev Adrian Copping, rounded up villagers to clear tons of snow for their big day to go ahead at St Berres Church, Llanferres, North Wales

Get me to the church on time! The Welsh village didn't let a little snow put a dampener on the couple's big day

The wedding venue in the remote village of Llanferres, North Wales, was completely cut off - and it was still snowing.

But Rev Adrian Copping of St Berres Church in the village was adamant that the wedding would go ahead.

He recruited an army of 30 locals who turned up with shovels and started clearing roads and pathways - even though they didn't even know the happy couple.

A call was made to the local council and a snowplough was sent to clear the road for guests to arrive.

Kind-hearted villagers spent five hours ploughing through the snow - and their hard work meant the roads were safe enough for the wedding to go ahead

And after five hours hard work the roads and pathways were declared safe enough for the wedding to go ahead.

The organist and some of the guests arrived after being given a lift by the local fire service.

Rev Copping said: 'It was a wonderful example of community spirit.

'At one point one of the shovellers pointed towards the sky and said someone seemed to have it in for us!

The kindness of strangers: The bride and groom were stunned when people they didn't know turned out to make the pathways safe for their wedding party

All hands to the deck: Rev Copping said 'It was a wonderful example of community spirit.'

'But as it happened I think we were all blessed, amidst the difficulties, with a wonderful spirit and with a lovely wedding for Michael and Alison.'

Wedding photographer Sarah Sadler said: 'When I got to the church it was amazing to see the whole community pulling together.

'They were absolutely freezing clearing the snow but they were determined the wedding would go ahead.

'Not just family and friends but people who didn't even know the bride and groom were all helping.'

Newlyweds Alison and Michael, both of Mold, North Wales, thanked the vicar and the villagers for their snow clearing feats - before flying to Mexico on honeymoon.
