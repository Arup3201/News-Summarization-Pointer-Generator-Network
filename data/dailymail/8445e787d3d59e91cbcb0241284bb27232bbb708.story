Fernando Torres must have felt a warm sense of familiarity as his plane touched down on the tarmac at Madrid's Barajas Airport on Tuesday.

Posting a picture on their Instagram, Atletico Madrid announced the arrival of their new striker, who gave fans a thumbs up whilst waiting for his baggage to arrive.

The La Liga champions wrote: 'Fernando @Torres has just landed at Barajas Airport. He sends greetings to all.'

Torres also answered questions for the waiting press ahead of his famous return to the club where he made his name 

On Monday Torres tweeted his excitement to be back at the club where he became a star as a teenager

Torres, 30, agreed to rejoin his boyhood club on loan from AC Milan on Monday and will stay until the end of the 2015-16 season.

During his first spell at the club the Spanish World Cup winner made 214 appearances for Atletico, scoring 84 goals.

His first match back in the red and white stripes could be against city rivals Real in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on January 7 - although the La Liga champions do play Levante on January 3. 

Real boss Carlo Ancelotti is looking forward to the the prospect of facing the striker he signed during his time at Chelsea for £50million.

In quotes reported by AS, the Italian said: 'It will be exciting to play against him. I wish him all the best.

'I like Fernando as a player and as a person. I coached him at Chelsea. It feels like he's going "home", a great motivation for him to give his all.'

Torres' future Atletico team-mate Koke joined those in support of the forward's return to the club where he began his career.

'It is very exciting for us to have Torres back,' said the 22-year-old. 'This is still a player that can be one of the best strikers in the world when he is playing regularly.

'This is not a player we are signing at 35 or 36 - at 30 he is still at his peak - and Europe knows that when he is playing at his best that he is unstoppable.'

Since signing for AC Milan from Chelsea Torres has yet to rediscover his scoring form from his Atletico and Liverpool days
