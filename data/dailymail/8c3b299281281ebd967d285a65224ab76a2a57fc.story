When Maura Horton's husband, former college football coach Don Horton, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, she felt helpless to aid him - until he came to her with a problem she could tackle: his clothes.

Don Horton hadn't been able to do up his shirt after training one day. That's when Maura Horton, 43, knew she had the solution to at least one of the obstacles Parkinson's had thrown at Don, 55. 

MagnaReady came into being as a blueprint on Maura's 
computer. The former children's clothing designer used her skills to 
make a dress shirt with strong magnets embedded behind the buttons, dispensing with fiddly buttonholes.

Husband help: Maura Horton wanted to find a way to make dressing easier for her husband Don Horton after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease

MagnaReady was created by Maura Horton for her husband, but her design has proved to be helpful to many other people suffering neurogenerative diseases like Don Horton, as well as people who have suffered strokes, arthritis, and even people with war injuries.

'Getting dressed shouldn't be a stressful task - living with a disability is hard enough,' says Maura Horton.

'There were a lot of challenges or changes [Don] might have been going through that I couldn't help,' she told Fox News. 'But that was one I thought I would try to get to the bottom of it.'

The hardest button to button: With no fiddly buttons or buttonholes, the MagnaReady is a great solution for people with limited mobility or impaired motor skills - it's also a great-looking shirt

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's, and proceeds in a similarly slow yet destructive way. According to MichaelJFox.org, one in 60 people over the age of 60 in the U.S. will be diagnosed with Parkinson's.

It was four years ago that Maura Horton got the idea of how to help her husband get dressed.

'I knew something was wrong when he came home,' she told CNN. 'I thought maybe it was a bad game.'

Don explained that a player, Russell Wilson who now plays for the Seahawks, had done up his buttons for him in the locker room because his fine motor skills were failing and he couldn't do it himself.

'I didn't want him to feel that way ever again,' said Maura. 

From a small home office in Raleigh, North Carolina, Maura has sold 1,000 MagnaReady shirts.

Don Horton left football coaching in 2012 and since then has been helping out with his wife's business. The couple are hoping the shirts will eventually be stocked in department stores; for now MagnaReady shirts can be bought at MagnaReady.com and some online distributors.

Shirt tales: The packaging of a MagnaReady shirt

The shirt looks like any other dress shirt, only its button and buttonholes are purely decorative. Behind the buttons are embedded magnets that Maura has tested for just the right strength. Too weak and the shirt will open easily, too strong and the shirts would be hard to take off. They also have to be specially coated to prevent rusting in the wash.

MagnaReady shirts currently come in blue or white and retail for $59.99. Maura Horton has more products in the works.

Don Horton has recently undergone brain surgery in a bid to improve his Parkinson's symptoms. As a result, he is wearing a battery pack similar to a pacemaker and can't wear the MagnaReady shirt in case it interferes with its functions.

It's a new challenge for Maura and she thrives on helping her husband. 'I could fall on my face,' she told News Observer. 'But at least I’ll bring some awareness to the disease.'
