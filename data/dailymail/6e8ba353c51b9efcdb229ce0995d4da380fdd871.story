England coach Ray Lewington was hobbling on crutches at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami after having an emergency knee operation.

Lewington woke in the night to find one of his knees had locked as he slept and needed to be dashed in for surgery on Friday to clean out the joint worn by a lifetime of football.

'It couldn’t have been worse timing,' he smiled, after watching England’s 0-0 draw against Honduras.

The squad left the United States for Brazil on Saturday night and Lewington, Roy Hodgson’s trusted assistant from his days at Fulham, hopes to be off his crutches before the flight to Manaus in the Amazon rainforest, on Thursday.

Gary Neville and fitness coaches Chris Neville and Tony Strudwick took care of all the warm-up routines ahead of the Honduras game, something that needed to be done twice - once before the original kick-off and again after the storm break, 22 minutes into the first half.

Florida State regulations meant the players had to leave the field for 30 minutes because there had been a lightning strike within an eight-mile radius of the stadium.
