With a wing span of up to 2.74 metres, it's safe to say that most small prey don't stand a chance against Australia's wedge-tail eagle.

But one tiny joey learnt that lesson the hard way, when it was snatched up by Australia's largest bird of prey for a meal.

Keen outback photographer, Wendy Kerr, described the emotional moment she managed to capture the snaps in regional Queensland.

'Came across this Wedgie at Mitchell, QLD, on the side of the road, then he flew off with what I first thought was a rabbit,' Ms Kerr wrote in her picture captions.

'I zoomed in on him as I was at least 100 metres away, and realised he had a joey.

'I know I just captured what happens in nature, but it dented my soul and hurt my heart and I was very sad for days, yeh I know I should harden up... but what can I say, he is just feeding himself as he knows....April 2014.'

Wedge-tailed eagles' main diets often consist of rabbits, wallabies and small kangaroos, however sometimes large groups of the fearsome bird will work together to take down larger sized prey, according to Australia Zoo.

While rabbits make up almost 70 per cent of their prey, the eagles are also known to eat carrion, or already dead animals, including road-kill.

Far from choosy, they are found across a variety of habitats throughout Australia, including over forests and open country on plains and mountains.
