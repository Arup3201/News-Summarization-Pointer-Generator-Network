A Canadian woman has become the first foreign female to join the Kurds battling the Islamic State in Syria, a  report has revealed.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was interviewed on Israel Radio where she said she had traveled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would go into combat in neighboring Syria.

The station did not name their interviewee, who spoke North American-accented Hebrew, but a source involved in the report identified her as Rosenberg.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was interviewed on Israel Radio where she said she had traveled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would go into combat in next-door Syria

'They (the Kurds) are our brothers. They are good people.
They love life, a lot like us, really,' Rosenberg said,
explaining why she joined up after contacting the guerrillas
over the Internet.

Rosenberg, a civil aviation pilot, enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009. She was then extradited to the United States where she was jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue
said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the
Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. 

She has
crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited
by YPG, the source added.

Syrian Kurds backed by fighters from northern Iraq have gained ground towards breaking the siege of the Syrian border town of Kobane. But they are drawing heavy fire from Islamic State insurgents and have yet to win back control. 

Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A
source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but
it was turned off on Tuesday. 

A Facebook page registered to Rosenberg showed photographs
of her in settings marked as Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria.

'In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's
show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means,' read a November 9 post.

Yahel Ben-Oved, an Israeli lawyer who represented Rosenberg
in the US criminal proceedings, said she had no knowledge of
her joining the Kurds even though they had spoken recently. 

'It is
exactly the sort of thing she would do, though,' said Ben-Oved.

Rosenberg had consented to extradition and served around
three years in a U.S. prison under a plea bargain, Ben-Oved
said. 

A 2009 FBI statement on the case names her as Gillian
Rosenberg, among 11 people arrested in Israel 'in a phony "lottery prize" scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly'.

Israel's NRG news site reported at the time that Rosenberg
turned to crime after running short on money, that she was
estranged from her parents and had tried in vain to join the
Mossad spy service.

More than 195,000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011, with successive attempts at internationally backed negotiations failing to yield a peace deal.

Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and
business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, seeing in the
minority ethnic group a buffer against shared Arab adversaries.

The Kurds are spread through Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq.
In the latter country, the have the autonomous Kurdish Regional
Government.

Israel bans its citizens from traveling to enemy states,
among them Syria and Iraq. It has been cracking down on Israeli
Arabs who return after volunteering to fight with Islamic State
or other rebels against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule.

Canada similarly worries about its citizens fighting in
Syria. Israeli and Canadian officials said they were aware of
Rosenberg's case, but did not immediately elaborate on what if
any efforts were being made to return her.
