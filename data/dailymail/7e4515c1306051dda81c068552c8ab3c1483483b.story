The Wall Street protesters had another surprise visitor today when Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon came along to show her support .

The 64-year-old stopped by the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Zuccotti Park on her way to Italy this afternoon.

She told the crowd: 'I'm just here to be educated and offer my support. There’s a lot of different kinds of people here who want to shift the paradigm to something that’s addressing the huge gap between the rich and the poor.

Celebrity turnout: Susan Sarandon talked with protesters and gave them advice on what to do, suggesting they focus on one issue and have people sign petitions

'I'm very happy to be here. I'm here to support freedom of speech. It never changes from the top, it only changes from the bottom. This is great.

'It helps to focus on one thing to be accomplished. Is everyone here registered to vote? Are you having people sign petitions?'

Sarandon is a veteran of protest marches and civil disobedience actions for liberal and humanitarian causes.

She gave the younger generation of 
ralliers some pointers, suggesting that they focus on one issue.

Last night, left-wing author and documentary maker Michael Moore made a surprise visit to protesters.

A populist but controversial figure, it could only have been a coincidence that his new book, Here Comes Trouble, has just hit book stores.

He joined campaigners at Zucotti Park, New York, on the 10th day of protests that have seen nearly 100 arrests and just hours after markets in the U.S. and across the globe had rallied.

Moore was especially welcomed by the protesters who are growing increasingly angry at an impressive array of things.

First
 it was the greedy bankers, then the plunging markets, followed by the 
mortgage crisis and even the execution in Georgia of convicted murderer 
Troy Davis.

Last night the 
arrival of Bowling For Columbine director Moore was topped only by one 
female protester stripping to her bare chest.

His arrival followed the previous day's surge by global
 markets, which made some of their biggest gains for two weeks.

Those rises continued again today with European markets rose up across the board - London's FTSE closed up 204.68 at 5,294.05.

The
 Dow Jones industrial average followed the path, shooting up 257.86 points to 11,301.72, thanks mainly to continuing house prices.

The Standard 
& Poor's 500 rose 26.45 to 1,189.40. The Nasdaq 
composite rose 54.05 to 2,570.74.

Sycophantic: Mr Moore's appearance came days after he started promoting his new book, described by the New York Times as 'a cabbage rather than a rose'

Investors
 have been on edge about Europe's debt problems for months. The Dow 
plunged 6.4 per cent last week, its biggest drop since the week ended 
October 10, 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.

The market's volatility has made many
 investors nervous. Since the first week of August, the Dow has closed 
up or down more than 200 points a total of 16 times. There were only 
four swings of 200 points or more in the other seven months of 2011.

However, the news of a multi-trillion dollar bailout package to help the defaulting Greeks appears to have settled investors.

But it hasn't soothed the mood of Mr Moore and his protesters.

The anti-capitalist said: 'These [protesters] and the people across this country 
have no say in how our economic system is run. Capitalism destroyed my 
town, Flint, Michigan, people have suffered as a result of the greed of 
corporations.

'I
 have actually done pretty decent [out of capitalism] because people 
come see my movies,' he told Fox News, adding: 'I totally reject the 
system. A happy day for me is when I will be unemployed.'

Mr
 Moore recently started promoting his new book, Here Comes Trouble, 
which has been panned as being self-aggrandising with New York Times 
describing it as 'a cabbage rather than a rose, a tangy ring of bologna 
rather than a sirloin.'

And that's one of the more favourable reviews.

No say: Mr Moore said that protesters and people across America have no say in how the economic system is run

The Sunday Telegraph suggested that even his most ardent fans would struggle to swallow the utter lack of immodesty in the tome.

Police were simply hoping that his presence did not cause any further trouble at Wall Street.

One police officer was allegedly injured 
during the protests by an Occupy Wall Street demonstrator over the weekend.

On
 Saturday some of the protesters took part in an unauthorised march 
which police allowed to pass peacefully.

There was trouble, however, on 
Saturday night when people were penned in behind yellow meshing and an 
used pepper spray on four women.

Trouble: At the weekend, however, police used mace on protesters penned in behind orange meshing which some have said was done without provocation
