Students at a Tucson, Arizona high school were shocked when they opened their yearbooks to find they'd been censored with black tape stuck hastily over students' messages.

Administrators undertook the massive, and some say misguided, task of covering up with tape the messages left by ten Sabino High seniors in every yearbook sold to the school of 1,300 students because they were deemed 'racist or unacceptable.'

But were they, really? Some schoolboard members are now demanding answers to why innocuous comments like 'Come getcha some,' which merely referenced a reality series on Animal Planet, are among the comments covered with damaging, sticky tape in every single $75 keepsake.

Censored: Students at Sabino High School in Tucson, Arizona were shocked when the received their yearbooks and found they'd been censored by administrators using hastily stuck on duct tape

'We don’t know what the school administration was thinking but this does not seem fair to the seniors of Sabino High School,' boardmember Michael Hicks told the Arizona Daily Independent.

People like Hicks are questioning the censoring of seemingly innocuous, if unintelligible messages, such as:

'Come getcha some –Turtleman.'

Too late: By the time administrators taped over the messages and the $75 yearbooks were finally doled out to students, the school year had ended and they were unable to write each goodbye messages

Others were more understandable, though far from shocking in their racial content.

'Every Mexican needs a white best friend,' said one Latina student before her words were obscured.

'They paid $75 for a book and they put tape all over it. Nothing I have read warrants what they have done. I think the district should apologize or give the kids.'

The tape could also be damaging to the 
yearbooks if removed. And by the time students received the yearbooks, 
which were withheld after printing in order for them to be censored, 
school as out and they couldn't sign each others' pages.

'The 
students got less than what they paid for, and they got it very late and
 missed the opportunity for inscriptions that is a big part of what 
makes the yearbook meaningful,' complained Mark Stegeman, another 
boardmember.

Perhaps
 most importantly, if the comments in question were deemed 
inappropriate, both Stegeman and Hicks agree that administrators should 
have dealt with them prior to printing.

'The
 principal should have reviewed this before it went to the printer. If 
it offends his sensibilities for whatever reason, those reasons should 
be articulated to the students, and adults should have talked to them 
about their objections beforehand,' said Hicks.

Culprits? Administrators said the censored comments were 'racist and unacceptable' but would not elaborate. One Latina student wrote 'Every Mexican needs a white best friend,' and was censored. Less understandable was the boy at right's comment, 'Come getcha some! --Turtle Man,' which is an innocuous reference to the Animal Planet reality series Call of the Wildman

Some of the comments mentioned race, but many did not appear at all offensive to a casual observer, like one that referenced an Animal Planet reality series
