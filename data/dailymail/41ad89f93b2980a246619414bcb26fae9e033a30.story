A businessman who took a gamble on a little known company in 1980 has been revealed as one of several billionaires who made their fortune thanks to Warren Buffett.

Stewart Horejsi's family welding business had been struggling to fight off competition when he first bought 40 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $265 each.

Friends had told him about Buffett, the company's chairman who he went on to model his life on, in a move that has propelled him up the rich list.

The 75-year-old father of two is now a billionaire, with a bigger stake in the profitable company than that owned by Bill Gates, the world's richest person - and Buffett's bridge partner.

Mentor: Billionaire Warren Buffett inspired Horejsi

He has 4,300 Class A shares of the Nebraska company, giving him a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg. However, the modest man has never appeared on an international wealth ranking.

Horejsi's path to his billion-dollar empire began with a modest investment.

In 1980 he bought 40 shares in Berkshire for $265 each - an initial investment of $10,600.

Two weeks later he bought 60 more shares at $295 each and, a month later, spent $66,000 buying 200 shares at $330.

This morning, the 4,300 shares he accumulated in Berkshire since 1980 were valued at $746 million.

'I kept running the [family] business, but I just kept buying Berkshire. I can’t really believe I put so much into one issue, though,' he said.

Horejsi was so impressed with Buffett, he has followed several of the billionaire philanthropist's moves.

In an interview with Wealth Estates he
said: 'Buffett is one of two people I’ve met in my life that within 60 
seconds of listening to him, you can feel an aura of integrity around 
him. It’s very comforting.'

When he was 43 Kansas welding supplier Horejsi took a year off to focus on his next move.

He read books such as Adam Smith's The Money Game which helped he realize his best opportunity was to invest outside the welding world.

'It was a profitable business, but 
companies took their money and bought more trucks,' Horejsi said. 'The 
competition just grew.'

Horejsi turned his attention to Berkshire, buying up more shares every time the market dipped.

Low key: Despite his billions Horejsi has never appeared on international wealth rankings and says his biggest extravagance is flying by private jet

As well as investing in Buffett's venture, he also emulates the billionaire's lifestyle in other ways and has remained grounded, living a low-key life between his American homes 
and a Barbados villa that has a 300-year-old palm tree in the front yard, according to Forbes.

He admitted to the Phoenix Business Journal that his greatest extravagance was flying by private jet, but the Kansas University graduate remains committed to supporting his old campus and other education charities.

Despite being a shrewd investor, Horejsi measures his own success in more personal terms, saying: 'If the people you want to love you, love you, then you are a success.'
