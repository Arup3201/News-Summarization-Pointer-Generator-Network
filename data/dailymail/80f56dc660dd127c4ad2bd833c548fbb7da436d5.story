Moeen Ali could be the latest England player to face a disciplinary charge after he was pictured wearing wristbands saying ‘save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ while batting on Monday.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed on Monday night they were investigating the circumstances which led to Moeen – a British-born Muslim who wears a beard as a symbol of his faith – choosing to make a political statement while playing for England.

Statement: Moeen Ali batted for England against India wearing wristbands that read 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine'

Drinks break: Ali stands with Ian Bell during England first innings at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton. Ali made 12 runs

The ICC code reads: ‘Players and team 
officials shall not be permitted to wear, display or otherwise convey 
messages through arm bands or other items affixed to clothing or 
equipment unless approved in advance by the player or team official’s 
Board.

'Approval shall not be granted for messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes.’

The
 ECB confirmed on Monday night that Ali had not asked their permission, 
although a spokesman said: ‘We do not believe Moeen has committed an 
offence.’

Not his day: Ali scored 12 runs towards England's first innings total

Fundraiser: Ali featured in a Twitter post by the Ummah Welfare Trust after he helped raise money for the people of Gaza in his home city of Birmingham

But if the ICC 
investigation deems Moeen has breached regulations he could be fined up 
50 per cent of his match fee for a level one contravention – the same 
punishment handed out to India all-rounder Ravi Jadeja for his part in a
 confrontation with England fast bowler James Anderson during the first 
Test at Trent Bridge.

Anderson faces a disciplinary hearing on Friday when he could face a ban if found guilty of a level three breech.

England’s
 players will today wear ‘Help for Heroes’ charity logos on their shirt 
collars in support of the wounded service charity, while there will be a
 minute’s silence observed at 10.56am in memory of the 100 year 
anniversary of the start of World War I.
