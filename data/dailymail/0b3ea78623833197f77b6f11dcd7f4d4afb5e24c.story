Lawyers for Rod Blagojevich filed an appeal just before a midnight 
deadline Monday that challenges the imprisoned former Illinois 
governor's corruption conviction and 14-year prison term, including on 
grounds the trial judge allegedly committed a litany of errors.

The 100-plus page filing with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in Chicago comes more than two years after the Chicago Democrat's 
retrial and 16 months after he entered a federal prison in Colorado.

Jurors convicted Blagojevich, 56, of engaging in wide-ranging 
corruption, including that the two-term governor sought to profit from 
his power to appoint someone to the U.S. Senate seat that Barack Obama 
vacated to become president.

Blagojevich's most shocking crime in the eyes of most observers was 
no crime at all, the appeal contends. Blagojevich was merely engaging in
standard politics when he floated the idea of securing a U.S. Cabinet 
seat or ambassadorship for himself if he appointed Obama confidant 
Valerie Jarrett to the Senate seat, it says. Neither Obama nor Jarrett 
have ever been accused of any wrongdoing in the case.

"The record shows that Blagojevich's proposed exchange was an arm's 
length political deal, described by Blagojevich as a political 'horse 
trade,'" the appeal says. It wasn't criminal "because the political deal
proposed by Blagojevich was a proper and common exchange under our 
democratic system of government."

The appeal also points to what it says was a lack of evenhandedness 
by U.S. District Judge James Zagel throughout Blagojeivch's two trials.

It alleges Zagel gave Blagojevich little choice but to testify at his
retrial after repeatedly ruling arguments the defense viewed as crucial
could only be broached by Blagojevich himself from the witness stand. 
Once on the stand, Zagel prohibited many of those statements, including 
Blagojevich's attempt to tell jurors he believed at the time that his 
actions were legal, it contends.

"Had Blagojevich been permitted to present his good-faith defense, it
would have been a powerful defense, likely to produce an acquittal," 
his lawyers argue.

The appeal also blames Zagel for allowing a juror who allegedly 
expressed bias against Blagojevich to remain on the jury despite defense
attorneys' objections. The appeal only referred to the panelist as 
Juror No. 174, saying he said about Blagojevich during jury selection, 
"I just figured him, possibly, to be guilty."

The appeal also raises longstanding claims that Zagel barred FBI 
wiretap evidence that might have aided the defense, that he sided 
overwhelming with prosecutors and that he miscalculated the appropriate 
prison term for Blagojevich.

The appeal was filed about 30 minutes before midnight.

Blagojevich was convicted on 18 counts over two trials, jurors in the
first deadlocking on all but one count. Taking the stand in the second,
decisive trial in 2011, Blagojevich insisted his talking about wanting 
to sell Obama's seat was just that â€” talk.

Zagel imposed a lengthy prison term at a sentencing hearing later in 
2011, telling Blagojevich he had abused voters' trust and undermined the
democratic process "to do things that were only good for yourself."

Many observers at the time said Blagojevich's best hope on appeal 
wasn't that a higher court would overturn his convictions but that 
appellate judges would agree his sentence was too harsh.

Appeals can take years to play out, and defendants rarely prevail.

Another Illinois governor convicted for corruption, George Ryan, 
filed multiple appeals over years and lost every key ruling. The former 
Republican leader was recently released after more than five years in 
prison and seven months of home confinement.

Secret wiretaps of an often foul-mouthed Blagojevich eager to earn big money were at the core of prosecutors' case.

"I've got this thing and it's f------ golden," jurors heard 
Blagojevich saying in one wiretapped conversation about Obama's vacated 
seat. "And I'm just not giving it up for f------ nothing."

As Inmate No. 40892-424 in the Federal Correctional Institution 
Englewood in suburban Denver, Blagojevich's life is highly regimented, 
including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn.

In a Facebook posting this year, Blagojevich's wife, Patti, said her 
husband is spending time in prison teaching Civil War history and 
learning to play the guitar. She added that he frequently jogs around a 
quarter-mile prison track.

"All that we have been left with is a aching hole in our lives," she added about herself and the couple's two daughters.

After the then-governor's Dec. 9, 2008 arrest, Blagojevich hit the 
talk show circuit to declare his innocence and to rail against 
prosecutors. He even appeared on Donald Trump's reality show, "The 
Apprentice."
