An 18-year-old Kentucky man who allegedly went on a crime spree with his underage girlfriend - earning them comparisons with Bonnie and Clyde - has said that the girl convinced him she was 18.

Speaking on camera from Bay County Jail in Florida, Dalton Hayes said 13-year-old Cheyenne Phillips showed him a fake ID, told him she had a truck and a license, and had a job.

'I asked her how old she was and she said she was 18 for the longest time,' he told WMBB-TV.

'I kept asking her old she was. She kept telling me 18 almost 19. She told me she had a truck, had a license, all that good stuff.'

At one point in their three-month relationship, she even told him she had been pregnant, he said.

Locked up: Dalton Hayes, who fled Kentucky with his underage girlfriend at the start of January and allegedly stole multiple trucks, said that she led him to believe she was 18 - and even showed him her ID

Speaking out: Hayes, 18, spoke to WMBB from a Florida jail as he awaits extradition back to Kentucky

'We were fighting and arguing again and she said, "by the way I had a miscarriage, I just didn't know how to tell you",' he said. 'And I said, "all you had to do was just tell me something".'

But Hayes learned her real age on January 4 when she stayed at his house for the night and Phillips' father reported her missing.

The couple fled - first allegedly stealing a truck in Kentucky that they drove through a cattle farm and then abandoned. They then allegedly stole another truck that they were seen driving in Manning, South Carolina, where they stopped at a Walmart.

They are then believed to have stolen a third truck in Georgia, which they drove to Florida.

On Sunday, the duo were found sleeping inside the stolen Toyota Tundra in an IHOP parking lot in Panama City Beach, and were taken into custody.

During their crime spree, they allegedly broke into homes and were caught on surveillance in Walmart using stolen checks.

'Fooled': He said that Cheyenne Phillips, 13, told him she had a truck, jobs and a driving license

Caught: The couple were seen on CCTV in a South Carolina Walmart as they eluded authorities last week

Stopped: They were eventually found sleeping in a stolen truck in an IHOP parking lot in Florida on Sunday

When they were found in Florida, the truck had two loaded guns inside. 

Hayes was charged with a warrant from Kentucky for custodial interference of a minor and was booked into the Bay County Jail Sunday. On, Monday he waived his right to an extradition hearing and is now waiting to be transported back to his home state.

After they were caught, Phillips' father said he didn't have a problem with Hayes.

'I don't have anything against him. I'm not upset with this boy. He's a boy. And apparently he thinks something of my daughter. He's just not thinking clearly,' Shawn Phillips said.

He also denied Hayes' claims in an earlier jailhouse interview that they fled Kentucky because Phillips' family had been beating her.

'Anyone that knows us knows better. My family is pretty well respected in the community,' he said. 

In custody: Hayes, who faced separate burglary charges before the crime spree, now faces charges for custodial interference of a minor. He appeared in court via video link on Monday, right

The duo fled from their small Kentucky town the day before Dalton's charges in a separate burglary case was scheduled to go before a grand jury.

He was facing five to ten years in jail after being charged with second-degree burglary - and he said he wanted to show his girlfriend the sea before being locked up, friends told DailyMail.com.

The crime spree had started on January 3 when Phillips' mother, Sherry Phillips, picked Cheyenne up from her house near Clarkson, police said.

Sherry Phillips does not have custody or visitation rights with her daughter, and police arrested her on Monday on a charge of custodial interference.

She is in jail on a $50,000 cash bond and has a court hearing scheduled for Thursday morning.
