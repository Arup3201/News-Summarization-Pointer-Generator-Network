Zoolander stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have collaborated with Italian label Valentino for the second time this month, posing for a unique fashion shoot in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, just weeks after they stormed the catwalk at the brand's Paris Fashion Week show. 

Many Zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the Valentino runway show earlier this month, in the guise of their iconic characters Derek Zoolander and Hansel.

But now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign, which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show.

Not content with crashing Valentino's Paris Fashion Week show, now models of the moment Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have taken over the fashion house's latest campaign shoots. And we just can't get enough.

The other creative duo, Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons.

We've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season. And one of our favorite prints from the fashion house is this red and white rendered one.

Just a few days we spotted Amanda Seyfried wearing a very similar pussy bow style from the Pre-Fall 2015 line for her stint on the red carpet at the While We're Young premiere in New York. Both dresses are really conveying that 1970s vibe we're all rocking right now.

The high-end fashion brand, which is usually known for its beautiful gowns and must-have accessories,  released the pictures from the stars' shoot earlier this week - prompting speculation that the label's designs will actually be featured in the upcoming Zoolander 2 movie. 

'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.'

But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway.

'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction.

'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.'

Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. 

Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. 

Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'.

'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement.

'We sort of had top three designers or brands that we went to and TJ Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory bowed out at the last minute so we went Valentino.'

Ben famously wrote and directed the 2001 movie, which detailed the life of the dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander. 

The original movie  poked fun at the fashion world and the duo managed to raise the roof when they stepped back into their comic roles at the end of Valentino's real-life autumn-winter women's collection.

Ben even recreated the trademark Blue Steel surprised duck-face look of his  Zoolander character for the chuckling photographers gathered at the venue in the gardens in front of the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower.

Zoolander 2, which began shooting last month in Rome, will be released in February 2016.
