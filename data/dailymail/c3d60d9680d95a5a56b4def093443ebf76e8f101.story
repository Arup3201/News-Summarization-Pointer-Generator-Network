A 28-year-old Australian mother faces a desperate wait to learn whether she will go to trial for killing her baby daughter who died after being left in a car on a hot summer's day in a country town.

Jayde Poole, an A-grade netball coach, was a single mother of three young children before the December day in 2012 when she strapped her youngest into a car seat and forgot her in 30-plus degree temperatures.

The tragedy happened in the inland Victorian town of Bendigo while Australia was undergoing a series of heatwaves, with temperatures reaching record highs in the December 2012 holiday season.

Australian mum Jayde Poole faces a trial for manslaughter after she left her baby daughter in her car on a hot day in a country town

Poole, who has made a formal application for charges against her to be dropped, faces up to 20 years for the manslaughter of baby Bella if convicted.

Committed to stand trial for manslaughter, Poole is approaching a court hearing which will determine her fate.

But she has tearfully pleaded she has no memory of placing five-month-old Bella in the back seat, and thought originally her daughter had been kidnapped.

The tragedy unfolded on the evening of December 11, 2012 in Bendigo, where the average temperature during the three hours Bella was strapped in the car topped 30 degrees celsius.

Poole, who lived with her children at her parents' house, had left home in the late afternoon to fetch a Hungry Jacks meal for her six-year-old son.

Normally, she would have left Bella at home with her mother, Debra, but Bella was grouchy and so Poole put her in the baby seat, facing backwards, for the short car ride.

They arrived home at 4.45pm. Poole locked the car with the remote control and carried the drinks into the house.

The boy finished his food at the kitchen table. Poole's older daughter woke from a nap and the children's grandparents sat at their computers checking out items on eBay.

Poole would later say in a police interview she believed she had put Bella down to sleep in a cot.

At some point, the older two children were bathed. Poole took a cup of tea outside and lit a cigarette to smoke while she telephoned her friend, Bree McOrmond, who was engaged to marry Poole's brother. 

It was after 6.30pm, and still hot.

A post mortem found traces of morphine in the body of five-month-old Bella, who died after mum Jayde Poole (above) left her in a hot car

The two friends chatted about Christmas shopping. The conversation lasted 19 minutes and 44 seconds until Poole heard her son call, 'Mum, Mum' and ended the call.

Poole then went to check on Bella in her cot in a front room of the house.

Neither Bella nor her bottle was in the cot.

Poole rang her sister, Megan Hillier, in a panic and told her: 'I put her down for a sleep and she's not there. Someone's taken her.'

Poole hung up and rang the Bendigo police to report a child abduction.

The police arrived within ten minutes and started searching the house.

Poole's brother, Christopher, was the first of several family members to turn up amid flashing blue lights, sirens and confusion among the neighbours who gathered outside the crime scene tape on the street.

An officer asked Poole to open her car which was parked not 200 metres from the house.

They made the terrible discovery - Bella in her car seat, not moving. Poole broke down, crying and screaming.

The baby was taken to hospital where medical staff tried to revive her. It was too late. They declared Bella dead.

Dr Mark Putland later told police he believed the child had been dead for some time before reaching hospital.

He observed 'bluish purple discolouration' on Bella's back and buttocks, which indicated the child was 'really dead'.

A post mortem on Bella discovered traces of morphine. Forensic examiners questioned whether paramedics administered the drug instead of adrenaline.

Over the ensuing year, as the Poole family tried to come to terms with the little girl's death, the Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions mounted a case against Jayde Poole.

Following a committal hearing, in which Jayde Poole sat tearfully, supported by her parents and siblings, she was ordered to stand trial for manslaughter.

A directions hearing earlier this month will continue on February 12, when Justice Terry Forrest will make the final decision of whether to proceed to trial in the Victorian Supreme Court.

Jayde Poole intends to enter a plea of not guilty if the seven to 10 day trial goes ahead.

The prosecution will call members of her family, along with police and ambulance officers and medical staff as witnesses.

Justice Forrest said he expected little dispute over the facts of the case, should it proceed to trial.

Prosecutor Michele Williams SC said there would not be "any factual dispute at all', but that the case against Poole might be dropped because it was 'different' from other child death cases.

Jayde Poole's relatives have told police she was a 'loving mum' and her children were 'always dressed well and clean and happy'.

Her mother Debra denied she was forgetful, saying she was 'really switched on' and would 'never do anything to hurt her kids'.

Bella Poole's death is the second high profile Australian case of a child dying after it was left in a car.

In Perth, Western Australia, last October, a father forgot to drop off his  son at a daycare centre.

When he went to collect the boy, he was told the11-month-old had never arrived. The boy was in the back of the father's car and unable to be revived.

Psychologists call this kind of tragic lapse of memory 'forgotten child syndrome' and say a rare combination of factors which combine to form the 'perfect storm' of memory error happens to parents around the world.
