The family of Chad Littlefield, who was shot dead alongside famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, has spoken out about their relief that the killer was found guilty of murder on Tuesday.

Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury in Stephenville, Texas read their verdict last night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on the two men in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines.

After the verdict, Littlefield's brother, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.'

As the family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders.

The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'.

Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial.

And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision.

'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie.

'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' 

Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict.

'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.'

Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole

Beloved: Chad Littlefield, pictured above left and right, was not a veteran but was committed to helping them when they returned from overseas, his parents said. He was shot dead by Routh in February 2013

Victim: Famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, pictured with his wife Taya, was also shot dead by Routh. The two men had taken Routh to a shooting range to help him with his PTSD when they were killed

Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings.

'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.'

Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices.

The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others.

'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained.

Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.'  

Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read. 

Fair trial? Jury members also spoke out on Wednesday and said they had 'no doubt' Routh was guilty - but they also admitted that some of them had seen the 'American Sniper' movie ahead of the trial

Chris Kyle's brother and parents were seen hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict, but they did not issue a statement. 

As prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence for Routh was life in prison - with no chance of parole. 

Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son.

Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake.

Defense attorneys noted that Kyle had described Routh as 'straight-up nuts' in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort and asked Littlefield to watch his back. 

While at the shooting range, Routh first opened fire on Littlefield, then turned on Kyle, whom he shot six times.

He later said he was 'riled up' because Littlefield wasn't joining in with the shooting, then murdered Kyle too because he knew he would kill him. Psychiatrists for the defense also claimed Routh believed the men were human-pig hybrids who were going to assassinate him.

After shooting the men dead, he fled in Kyle's pickup truck, drove to see family members and even stopped at Taco Bell. He was eventually arrested after a police chase and later confessed to the crime on video, which was played to the jury. 

Among evidence entered by prosecutors was a recorded phone call between Routh and a reporter  in which Routh said he was annoyed Littlefield wasn't shooting.

'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in the phone call. 'That's what got me all riled up.' 

Routh's friends and family testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic and that 'he did not seem all there' after gunning down the two men.

Routh, who served with the Marines in Iraq and Haiti, had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals on multiple occasions after his service to treat mental illness. 

They said he was unable to care for himself, acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and thought that the government was listening to him.  

Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him

This pistol, found in Kyle's truck, which Routh fled in, matched bullet fragments found in Littlefield's body

Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately

'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, told the court on Thursday. 'There was no question about that.' 

But the jury rejected the claim after prosecutors contended Routh knew what he was doing and acted deliberately when he shot the two and then fled.

They said any bizarre behavior was the result of Routh's reliance on marijuana. He had smoked the drug with his uncle the morning before the shootings.

A prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law.

'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified.

Chad Littlefield, then 35, was killed in 2013 along with his more famous friend Chris Kyle

The case of Eddie Ray Routh has been dubbed the 'American Sniper' trial after its most famous victim, author and US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.

However the other casualty of that February day at a Texas shooting range was Chad Littlefield, Kyle's devout  friend who also helped out with the sniper's charitable foundation.

He was trying to help smooth Routh's transition to civilian life when he was shot , age 35.

Born in Dallas in 1977, he graduated from DeSoto High School in 1995.

The father was devoted to his wife LeAnn, daughter Morgan, now nine, and Christianity. 

Though he did not serve in the military, he was passionate about helping veterans with Kyle, who he met through their daughters soccer team. 

He had visited his parents the day before his death, and spent extra time at their house that day.

'Mom, life is so good it's scary,' he told mother Judy that day, according to the Stephenville Empire-Tribune. 

He was working for an oil-services firm in DeSoto as a logistics manager and was known as the peacekeeper in his family, always urging relatives to talk through their conflicts.

The charity volunteer hugged his parents right before he said goodbye to them for the last time.

His parents gave a statement to reporters after Routh was convicted of their son's murder. 

We've waited two years for god to get justice for us on behalf of our son, Chad's mother Judy said.

'We're so thrilled that we have the verdict we have tonight.' 

Littlefield's father Don, a high school football coach, confronted Routh, who said he did not remember Chad's name, after the trial, the Star-Telegram reported.

He said 'You will have the rest of your wasted life, each and every day, to remember his name. Let me remind you. His name was Chad Littlefield.'

Littlefield would have turned 38  on February 11.
