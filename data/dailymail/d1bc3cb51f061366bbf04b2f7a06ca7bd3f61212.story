The American mall is dying as an increasing number of super-sized shopping centers are closed or torn down and replaced with office buildings.

The malls built during the 60s, 70s and 80s are most at risk, and analysis firm Green Street Advisor forecasts that 10per cent of them will close within 
the next 10 years.

But CEOS say the rate may actually be much higher, The Atlantic Cities reports - and the final nail in the coffin could be the rise of smaller, open air 'anti malls'.

The massive enclosed malls epitomized by 1980s teen movies Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Valley Girls were built by the Baby Boom generation as part of post-World War II suburbia.

Many of their children came of age inside the shopping centers, and had their first dates over a piece of Sbarro pizza followed by movie or video game.

But since the early 00s, as young workers leave the suburbs for urban centers, old-school malls have been in decline. The giant structures seem out of place in the pedestrianized areas, because the blank walls and limited doors make them awkward to access. 

The Internet has also hit malls hard. Online retail saw a 14per cent increase this year, according to Forbes, and is growing around 10 times faster than brick-and-mortar stores.

There are many blogs and sites devoted to
mall death watches. Deadmalls.com memorializes more than 400 shuttered 
shopping destinations, and more are always being added.

Even the iconic Sherman Oaks Galleria that 
was the setting for Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Valley Girls closed
down in the mid-1990s.

Like many other shopping centers, it sat vacant for several years before being re-opened as a much smaller open-air plaza.

Indeed, shoppers are also flocking to hybrid
destinations like The Grove, with outdoor streets and a farmer's marked next door that give it a small-town feel.

Each year the complex attracts more than 18 million shoppers, and huge crowds turn out for its special events.

That was then: During the 1980s the malls were a popular teen hangout, as shown in the movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Experts also say that Generation Y 
customers want a smaller, more personalized shopping experience - and 
stores are scrambling to provide it.

Washingtonian magazine mentions Bethesda Row, which has been 
transformed from decaying industrial strip to chic shopping destination,
as a suburban center that has gotten a successful makeover.

Some experts argue that mall death stories are premature, because the provide Americans with communal space.

Shopping centers have been around at least since Trajan's Forum brought a six-story complex of shops and offices to Rome in 107 AD. Bazaars and souks
flourished in Middle Eastern and Northern African countries for 
thousands of years, and covered arcades were all the rage in 18th and 19th century Europe.

The environment may change, but Americans will always love to shop.
