West Brom have responded to criticism over their tweet in which they appeared to mock Marouane Fellaini - before he fired in a fine goal for Manchester United on Monday.

While the Belgium midfielder was warming up at half-time during the 2-2 draw the The Hawthorns, Albion's official Twitter account posted: ‘Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN’.

However Fellaini scored and after being criticised on social media, West Brom tweeted an apology of sorts: ‘Sorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage. It was not intended as a slur.’

The club later insisted that the intention was to make a Carry On-style gag about Fellaini 'stripping off' but instead of being naked under his tracksuit top, he had a United shirt on. Albion say it was not meant to be a put-down.

That joke was probably not worth the effort, in hindsight. 

United substitute keeper Anders Lindegaard was one of those to criticise the Baggies Twitter account after the match, saying: ‘Complete lack of knowledge, class and respect on Twitter from @WBAFCofficial on Fellaini!! #united #karma #keepbelieving.’ 

This tweet from the WBA official Twitter account at half-time appeared to mock United player Fellaini

Having entered play at half-time, it only took Fellaini three minutes to fire in this fierce strike to equalise

The much maligned £27.5million man scored after 48 minutes, which was his first goal for United since signing last September during David Moyes’ tenure.

After the match Fellaini added: ‘It was a great feeling. I've waited a long time for this moment,’ he said after the match.

However despite Fellaini’s efforts, England U21 forward Saido Berahino slotted West Brom back in front and Manchester United were only rescued late on thanks to a low drive from Daley Blind to save van Gaal’s blushes.
