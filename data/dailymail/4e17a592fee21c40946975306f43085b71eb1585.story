A Missouri mother has been arrested and her son's elementary school put on lockdown after she entered the school building without signing in when she came to pick him up.

Niakea Williams says she was called to Walnut Grove Elementary School Thursday by her son Michael's teacher who told her the boy, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, had become anxious.

'I was lying in bed when I received a frantic phone call from the teacher, Michael was panicking,' Williams said.

Arrested: Missouri mother Niakea Williams, pictured, has been arrested and her son's elementary school put on lockdown after she entered the school building without signing in when she came to pick him up

When she arrived at the St Louis school, she was buzzed in by school officials.

'I saw a teacher and she said "Ms Williams what is wrong?" I said "something is wrong with Mikey" and proceeded to go straight to my son,' she told KMOV.

When she got to her son's classroom, she began to console him.

That's when the school principal informed her she was violated school policy by not signing in.

'I didn't sign the book, but I had to check on my son. I sais "you can bring me the book," but she said "oh no, I've already called the police." (And I said) "You called what,"' Williams recalled.

Calverton Park Police responded to the call, which alerted them to an 'unauthorized entry to a school' and the school was also put lockdown for 12 minutes.

When officers arrived, Williams was handcuffed and taken to the police station on trespassing charges.

'They escorted me away from my son, who already has emotional distress. Four officers told me to turn around and put my hands behind my back, I was under arrest,' she told KMOV.

Williams said she is a known parent and had even met with the principal on Wednesday about a separate issue.

She claims her arrest was unnecessary and over the top.

'I feel like today I got arrested for being a concerned parent of my child,' she said.

As well as the arrest and school lockdown, a letter was sent home to parents regarding the incident.
