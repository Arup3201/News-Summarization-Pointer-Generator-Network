Flowers, chocolates, jewellery, perfume, yawn, snore, bleurgh.... Is it just us, or are typical Valentine's Day gifts beginning to feel a little bit tired?

If you too are bored of the traditional 14 February cliches, perhaps it's time to take a page out of this innovative American husband's book. Or, rather, to tear a leaf out of his Post-it notepad....

In what is possibly the cheapest (and most adorable) Valentine's gift we've heard of this year, Jesse Ben Hale, a creative wedding photographer from Kansas, has set about telling his wife Holly that he loves her every day for 100, with reasons why she's so special scribbled on 100 Post-it notes.

Day 20: I love that you help me remember stuff

For the price of a packet of yellow Post-its and a biro (less than Â£2, or $3), Jesse has touchingly recorded all the reasons he thinks his beloved is so fabulous.

He has then filmed each one, posting them to Give It 100, a website encouraging people to pursue a creative project for 100 days.

Jesse is 25 days into his project, and has so far offered reasons for his devotion that range from the touching ('you listen to my stories') to the funny ('you secretly like cats') to the sincerely proud ('you don't like going to work, but you are stonking good at your job').

The project is titled simply: 'I'm telling my wife I love her for 100 days.'

Alongside the husband's 100-day tribute to his wife, other site users have remarked how devoted he is, and what a lovely idea his is.

Nancie commented that 'every woman in the world will be in love with you!' while Morgann said: 'This is a really cute idea. I'm sure she loves it.'

Aliza, clearly having a few troubles in her own love department, wrote: 'I needed to see this today. Real men still do exist. Inspirational, thanks.'

Day 14: You listen to my stories

Day 9: You don't let me leave the house without fixing my hair

Day 1: You are more beautiful than I could ever imagine

Day 3: Listening to you sing next to me on Sunday morning. It doesn't get much better

Day 2: You only share your true humour with me

Day 4: I love those rare times when I can get you to truly smile before 7am
