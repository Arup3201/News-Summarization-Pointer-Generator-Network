A husband whose wife has just died of meningitis now faces an agonising wait to discover whether he too has contracted the disease.

George Cary, 65, was told that Lilian, his wife of 35 years, had contracted meningitis from tainted steroid injections intended to treat her back pain.

And Mr Cary's own back injections may have come from a contaminated batch too - meaning that when he laid his wife to rest today he still did not know if he too was suffering from the deadly illness.

Grief: After the death of Lilian Cary, left, her husband George, right, fears he could have contracted meningitis

Victim: Mrs Cary, who was born in Britain, died in Michigan last month at the age of 67

British-born Mrs Cary is one of 11 people across the U.S. to have died of fungal meningitis contracted from medication mixed by a pharmacy in Massachusetts.

Her husband went to an emergency room last weekend for a spinal tap, but the test results had not arrived by the time of Lilian's memorial service in Howell, Michigan on Tuesday.

'They advised me to watch for symptoms,' Mr Cary said. 'At this point, there's nothing abnormal, but they said the same thing when Lilian had hers.

'Not only have I lost my wife, but I'm watching the clock to see if anything develops.'

Memorial: Mrs Cary is the 11th victim of fungal meningitis contracted by tainted steroid injections

Michigan has at least 21 cases of meningitis related to steroid shots made by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts.

In the country as a whole, 119 cases of the illness have so far been linked to the injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, and a back injection would put any contaminant in more direct contact with that lining.

Mrs Cary died on September 30, aged 67. She had been ill since late August, but it was not diagnosed as meningitis until September 22.

Nonetheless, her health seemed to be improving at University of Michigan hospital.

'She was responding to medication. Her spirits were up. Her fever was broken,' Mr Cary said. 'She was walking the hallway and Skyping with grandsons.'

But she became unresponsive on September 26, and was eventually removed from life support after suffering a stroke.

Mr Cary said he was informed on Saturday that his wife had been treated with tainted steroids for back pain. The doctor at Michigan Pain Specialists said Mr Cary also was at risk.

'The whole staff is devastated,' said Mr Cary. 'The people there are professionals. I have the greatest respect for their care. They truly care about the people they treat. They're suffering just as much as I am.'

Mrs Cary was a native of Stoke-on-Trent in England who emigrated to the U.S. in 1965 to work as a nanny. The Carys met in Mount Kisco, New York, and were married in 1977. They moved to Michigan in 2000 after many years in the St Louis area and have lived in Howell since 2003.
