Legia Warsaw owner Dariusz Mioduski last night angrily branded UEFA’s decision to hand Celtic a passage to the Champions League play-off round a sporting scandal.

And in an interview with Sportsmail, the majority shareholder of the Polish champions further claimed his club would have handed the tie to Celtic had the disciplinary shoe been on the other foot.

A multi-millionaire investor and businessman in Warsaw, Mioduski spoke out after UEFA upheld a decision to punish Legia for fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski as a substitute for the last four minutes of their 2-0 win over Celtic in Edinburgh.

Appeal: Dariusz Mioduski, owner and chairman of Legia Warsaw, at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon

Henning Berg’s team earned a 6-1 aggregate victory – but now find themselves facing a trip to Kazakhstan in the Europa League after UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body upheld the decision to award Celtic a 3-0 second leg victory.

‘I think this is a scandal because I don’t know a court in a democratic country anywhere where the penalty would be so grossly disproportionate to the crime,’ Mioduski told Sportsmail.

‘I cannot believe there is another organisation like UEFA which stands so far outside of the principles of justice anywhere in Europe or the democratic world.

‘Let’s admit that and change this crazy rule. It is a scandal because it is such a flagrant instance of going against the spirit of the game.’

Verdict: Legia Warsaw are out of the Champions League as they fielded an ineligible player

Handed a three-match ban for a red card in the Europa League last season, Bereznyski sat out two qualifiers against Ireland’s St Patrick’s Athletic and the first leg 4-1 win over Celtic in Warsaw.

But, in a critical error, Legia administrator Marta Ostrowska failed to register the defender in the squad to face St Pat’s – meaning the first two games of his ban were never properly recognised.

‘If our player had not served his three-game suspension and played against St Pat’s or in the first game with Celtic it would have been different,’ added Mioduski.

‘But we left a space open in our squad for those games – we didn’t put anyone else in our squad instead.

‘We were saying: “This player is suspended, we have left him out.”

Manager: Henning Berg's side won 6-1 over the two legs, but Celtic will progress to the next round

‘It was clear we complied with the spirit of the law. But because of a small technicality and interpretation of the rule, we suffer.

‘Everybody says it’s clear, rules are rules. But we showed in our appeal that it is confusing. Because of that, the penalty is gross. Grossly unfair.

‘I am appealing to UEFA to rethink this rule because it is simply not fair.’

At a press conference last Sunday, Mioduski angered Celtic by applying emotional blackmail on the Parkhead club to forfeit the tie.

When that failed, Legia put their case at a UEFA appeal hearing on Wednesday morning in Nyon.

Shock: Ronny Deila's Celtic were poor in both legs, and deserved to go out based on their performances

Mioduski has vowed to pursue the matter all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with CAS secretary general Matthieu Reeb confirming yesterday that Legia could take advantage of a fast-track process before the Champions League play-off first leg against Maribor next Wednesday.

With Celtic already preparing for a flight to Slovenia, however, a statement from the Scottish champions read last night: ‘We have been advised by UEFA of the decision of the Appeals Body to dismiss an appeal by Legia Warsaw. We understand that Legia Warsaw may appeal that decision to CAS.

‘For our part we can only proceed on the basis of UEFA’s decisions and the fixtures announced by them and, therefore, we must now prepare for our match against NK Maribor next week.’

Persistently critical of Celtic’s willingness to take advantage of a lifeline worth a potential £15million in revenue, Mioduski claimed Legia would have reached the opposite decision had the roles been reversed.

Outplayed: the Polish side won 4-1 in the home leg, and 2-0 in Scotland

‘We have asked ourselves many times how we would react if Celtic had played a suspended player.

‘In our heads and in our conversations we came to the same conclusion. We would have given the tie to Celtic.

‘We have very specific fans here. For them the issue of honour is incredibly important.

‘Our fans would not accept it if we took advantage of a situation like this as Celtic have.

‘Of course there would be a number who would say we were stupid giving up a place in the Champions League and all that money.

‘But in the end, taking into account our history and the values we want to be known for as a club, I think we would make a decision to not take advantage.

‘Who knows? It would have been a very difficult decision, but I think we would have been on the right side of the situation.’

Meanwhile, Ronny Deila says Celtic are fully prepared for their tie with Maribor – despite days of uncertainty over their fate.

Future: Celtic will now face Maribor over two legs as they look to reach the Champions League group stages

He had no idea until yesterday lunchtime if his side were heading for Slovenia or Kazakhstan in the Europa League but proceeding on the basis they would play Maribor, he said: ‘We have had them watched.

‘We have full reports on them. They are a good team, well organised. They are compact and good on the counter attack. They have some good players as well.

‘They have won their league three years in a row but you always meet good teams in the Champions League.’

Asked if the Slovenian champions – conquerors in recent years of Rangers and Hibs – were better than Legia, Deila shrugged.

‘It’s hard to say. I haven’t watched them myself in person, but I think it’s pretty close.

‘We have to step up a level in our performances - that’s the most important thing.

‘But we are now two or three weeks further on. We have played one domestic game and are back at Celtic Park.

‘We have got players in also and I am looking forward to the games.

‘I’m just happy we are getting fixtures now, real matches you can learn from.

‘You give feedback to the players and work from there. And that’s why I’m looking forward, first, to the game on Saturday against Dundee United.’
