Insensitive bosses handed out free calendars to staff which declared 'a bright future for our company' just hours after making 60 staff members redundant.

Employees at Marston Aerospace in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, branded the gesture 'a kick in the teeth' and said it had been ill-timed.

Just one day after managers announced they were making 60 workers redundant, bosses handed out free 2014 calendars to all staff.

The front cover of the calendar features a coastal sun-set under the words: 'A Bright Future for Our Company 2014 Calendar.'

A caption on the calendar also reads: 'Explore your horizons.'

One furious worker said: 'I saw all these calendars laid out for us and when I read what was on the front I felt like throwing them in the bin.

'We usually get them in December and had we had them then there wouldn't have been an issue but the day after we're told 60 people could be made redundant just feels like a kick in the teeth.'

Another compared the move to Ricky Gervais' awkward character David Brent, famed for his insensitive comments.

The firm, which currently employs 320 workers, announced last week that it was relocating premises with the loss of 60 jobs

They said: 'You couldn't make it up. It's the sort of thing David Brent would tell staff in The Office.

'Some people thought it was a joke and laughed but deep down it shows just how insensitive managers can be.'

The firm, which currently employs 320 workers, announced last week that it was relocating premises with the loss of 60 jobs.

A company spokesperson said: 'We traditionally provide a calendar for all employees as a token of recognition for their efforts throughout the year.

'One feature of this calendar is a collection of photographs submitted by employees.

'We remain confident that the business does have a bright future in Wolverhampton.'
