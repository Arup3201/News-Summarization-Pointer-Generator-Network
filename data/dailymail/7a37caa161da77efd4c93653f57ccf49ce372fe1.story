World class strikes from Jordon Ibe and Craig Bryson kept Derby County top of the Championship as Watford’s unbeaten home record was left in tatters.

Ibe, on loan from Liverpool, curled the ball home magnificently to give the Rams the lead six minutes before half time, the 18-year-old underlining his indisputable quality.

Watford levelled through substitute Gianni Munari mid-way through the second-half after a neat move that unlocked the Derby defence and at that point looked decent value to win it.

But Bryson settled an engrossing contest when he fired into the top corner with 10 minutes remaining.

The result - and the impressive performance - was a real statement from Steve McClaren’s men, who are fancied to put last season’s play-off final heartache behind them and return to the Premier League via the automatic route.

Watford have recorded some eye-catching results at home this season and are very much promotion candidates themselves but despite plenty of endeavour were unable to match their visitors.

Slavisa Jokanovic, hoping back-to-back defeats prior to the international fortnight had been worked out the system, restored Odion Ighalo to the forward line with Munari dropping to the bench.

McClaren, whose Rams side thrashed Wolves 5-0 to assume top spot a fortnight ago, brought in Ibe for Simon Dawkins.

The visitors started confidently, stroking the ball around and pressurising Watford’s back line into some early errors. Jeff Hendrick’s deflected shot from the edge of the box on five minutes was pushed onto the post by Bond as Derby showed their table-topping quality.

Watford were forced to play on the counter-attack early on but they were dangerous when in advanced areas.

Lloyd Dyer was played in by Keith Andrews but Jack Butland, whose loan from Stoke was extended by a week so he could feature here, was equal to it.

Ryan Shotton made a crucial slide challenge to deny Ighalo as he prepared to pull the trigger and Troy Deeney shrugged off the attentions of Hendrick to fire towards the bottom corner. Butland, who was unsighted, did brilliantly to turn it away one-handed.

Another gilt-edged chance fell to Forestieri on the half-hour. Deeney’s diagonal pass found him in plenty of space but the Italian hesitated and Craig Forsyth nipped in to dispossess him.

Derby reasserted themselves again as the half wore on and Chris Martin’s clever touch took him beyond Joel Ekstrand, only for Bond to push his shot round the post.

It needed a moment of magic to illuminate a dreary afternoon in Hertfordshire and Ibe obliged. With Juan Carlos Paredes hopelessly out of position, the teenager got the better of Forestieri and bent the ball into the far corner.

Ibe, a south London lad who was signed by Liverpool two years ago, is regarded as a bright prospect and has represented England up to Under 20 level. This was the fourth goal of his season-long loan at Pride Park.

It was a deserved lead for Derby and they could easily have doubled it when Omar Mascarell’s free-kick was flicked towards goal by Lloyd Doyley under pressure from Martin and Bond tipped it over.

Jokanovic introduced seven-goal top scorer Matej Vydra at half-time to try and provide some forward thrust and Deeney tested Butland after Paredes had beaten Ibe down the right. A couple of minutes later, Forestieri made space on the edge of the box but curled a shot wide.

At the opposite end, Martin was left kicking himself after finding himself clean through only to take the long way round Bond rather than aiming for the far corner. The keeper gratefully grabbed the ball from him.

Watford gradually took a stranglehold on proceedings, with Munari also introduced and the man on loan from Parma drew them level after a lovely one-touch move on 67 minutes. Munari smashed the ball home after Vydra played him through, the two substitutes combining to good effect.

Moments later, Vydra could have given Watford the lead but he fired just off target from 20 yards and suddenly the hosts looked the most likely winner.

However, Derby still had plenty going forward when they got the chance and Russell’s strong run led to Forsyth being denied by Bond at point-blank range.

But they didn’t have to wait much longer for their moment. Craig Bryson, who had replaced Will Hughes, drove inside from the left and leathered the ball into the top corner from 25 yards. Should Derby gain promotion, that goal will be looked back upon for many years to come.

It sparked delirious scenes among the 2,000 travelling fans, who increasingly believe this is their season.
