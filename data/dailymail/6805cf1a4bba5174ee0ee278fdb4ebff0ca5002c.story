A high-priced prostitute accused of leaving a Google exec to die on his yacht in California after giving him a fatal dose of heroin has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and heroin charges.

Alix Tichelman, 26, entered the plea on Wednesday in a Santa Cruz County courtroom, where a judge refused to reduce her $1.5 million bail. Prosecutors also charged her with great bodily injury.

After the hearing, her defense attorney Larry Biggam insisted she had no reason to kill 51-year-old married father-of-five Forrest Hayes last November because he was paying her so much money.

Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter.

Denial: Alix Tichelman, pictured in court during her arraignment on Wednesday, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in the death of one of her clients. She is accused of giving him a fatal dose of heroin

In court: Her attorney said she had every reason to keep him alive because he was paying her so much

That day, 
they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft 
Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, 
police said.

Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said.

Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside.

Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported.

'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday.Â

 as her wealthy client Forrest Hayes, right, suffered complications from
 a heroin overdose and died. Instead of calling 911, she gathered her 
belongings and left

Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim.

They also identified her from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said.

They
 then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her 
parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client 
who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a 
luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested.

Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

Former flame Dean Riopelle, also 51, reportedly died under similar circumstances only months prior.

The investigation into Riopelle's death - from an overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol - has been reopened, police told WSB.

'It's
still conjecture looking at the similarities of the two situations, but
obviously we're going to go back and look at it and make sure that 
everything determined to be correct, almost a year ago, is still factual
and still accurate,' said Capt. Shawn McCarty with the Milton Police Department.

Second victim? Dean Riopelle, 53, died of a heroin overdose in September 2013 in Georgia about two months before Hayes passed away. Riopelle had also been seeing Tichelman at the time of his death

Tichelman claimed at the time that Riopelle had been drinking and shooting heroin all day, police said.

The
 call girl was also arrested for biting Riopelle, McCarty recalled to 
the station. She was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and 
falsely reporting a crime but it is not clear if she was charged.

Riopelle, once the lead singer for the Impotent Sea Snakes, lived in fear or Tichelman, according to at least one friend.

'At
first he was really happy. But toward the end, he had a lot of fears of
her. He even tried to stop her from going to his own club,' Michael Lacy told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Hayes,
 who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to 
wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his 
obituary.

Tichelman's
 Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before 
majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty 
school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist.

On social 
media, she posed in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and
 posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months 
ago.

Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online

Speaking to fiXE fETISH, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character.

'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an "intense child" and already liked horror movies.'

She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'.

'Really
nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in 
cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post.

'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added.

Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.
