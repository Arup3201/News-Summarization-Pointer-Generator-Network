Rafael Nadal is referencing the past and the future with his equipment at this year’s Australian Open — and so far it does not seem to be doing him any harm.

The 28-year-old Spaniard is looking ahead with his racket, which includes a microchip transmitter in the handle that records which type of shots he is hitting and at what velocity. His increasingly tight shorts, meanwhile, are more of a throwback to the 1970s.

Most importantly he is now off the mark for the season, winning his first round with surprising ease against Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. The microchip racket technology is legal from the start of this year.

‘It is a help to see how many forehands and backhands you hit,’ said Nadal. ‘I know to play well I have to hit 70 per cent forehands and 30 per cent backhands.’

As for the shorts, he says: ‘We made them a bit shorter last year and this year a little bit more. I feel more comfortable this way, more fresh.’

Back problems and then appendicitis wrecked the second half of last year for Nadal, and he did not look good in this season’s early run-outs.

Nadal said that he has not felt any pain in his back this season after being plagued by injury last season

But he is a different creature in the Grand Slams, where his form tends to build towards a crescendo. And, after beating the tough Youzhny, he finds himself in by far the easiest part of the men’s draw, with American journeyman Tim Smyczek up next.

He should now be able to gain desperately needed matches in the first week and then ratchet up his level in the second.

‘For the moment this year the back is not limiting me,’ said Nadal. ‘You always have doubts before the first match, so winning today gives me some confidence.’

Former finalist and No 5 seed Ana Ivanovic was upset 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 by Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka.
