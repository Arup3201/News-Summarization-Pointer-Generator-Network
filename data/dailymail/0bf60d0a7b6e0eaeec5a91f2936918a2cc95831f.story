Everton

Roberto Martinez expects Romelu Lukaku to be fit for Sunday's Barclays Premier League trip to Arsenal.

Lukaku came off early in the second half of Thursday's Europa League victory over Young Boys, but Martinez has played down suggestions a hamstring problem might keep the striker out of the game at the Emirates Stadium this weekend, saying he is "fine" and "trained well" on Friday.

The Toffees have John Stones and Aaron Lennon - suspended and cup-tied respectively on Thursday - back available, but remain without Steven Pienaar, Aiden McGeady (both knee), Christian Atsu (illness), Bryan Oviedo (hamstring) and Tony Hibbert (knee).

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Stones, Alcaraz, Jagielka, Distin, Coleman, Baines, Garbutt, Besic, McCarthy, Barry, Barkley, Gibson, Osman, Mirallas, Lennon, Naismith, Lukaku, Kone.
