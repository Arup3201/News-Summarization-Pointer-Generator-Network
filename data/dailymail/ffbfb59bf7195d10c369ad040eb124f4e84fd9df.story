The average pensioner living in a developed country is less likely to suffer from dementia today than in the past, doctors say.

Studies show that the risk of the disease seems to be falling in the UK, US and other wealthy nations.

The increased use of blood pressure and cholesterol-busting drugs and better standards of education are credited with keeping the brain sharper for longer.

Rates of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are falling in the developed world - but increasing in poorer nations, new research has shown. Image shows a brain with Alzheimer's

However, a major Alzheimer’s conference heard that there is no room for complacency.

The
 ageing population means the number of cases is still rising in rich 
countries, while the number of people with dementia in the developing 
world is thought to have been severely underestimated.

And improvements in brain health in recent years could be jeopardised by the rising tide of obesity.

A
 series of studies have shown that a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s and 
other forms of dementia is falling in the US and Europe, the Alzheimer’s
 Association International Conference in Copenhagen heard.

A US 
government-funded study found that an American aged 60-plus today is 
almost half as likely to develop dementia than someone of a similar age 
did roughly 30 years ago.

The fall in risk has been particularly 
steep in women, and the average age at which dementia is diagnosed has 
risen – from 80 in the 1970s to 85 today.

A similar British analysis,
 published in the Lancet medical journal last year, found the chances of
 developing dementia in old age have fallen by almost a quarter since 
the 1990s. Studies from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands show a 
similar pattern.

It is thought that the increasing number of drugs 
prescribed to combat heart disease is helping to keep dementia at bay by
 keeping the brain healthy. The fall in smoking, another risk factor for
 dementia, is also likely to have helped.

Experts say rates of dementia are falling thanks to risk factors for the disease - such as high blood pressure and cholesterol - are better controlled

And increasing access to 
education is thought to be vital, with studies showing that the longer a
 person spends at school and university the slower their descent into 
the disease.

More challenging careers have a similar protective effect. 
 Claudia Satizabal, of Boston  University, who compiled the US figures, 
said greater equality in the job market could help explain  why rates 
have fallen particularly among women.

‘The results bring some hope that perhaps dementia cases may be preventable or at least delayed,’ she added.

‘The number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble
 in the next 40 years worldwide. This means that dementia is still going
 to be front and centre as a public health issue' - Dr Kenneth Langa

Dr
 Kenneth Langa, a University of Michigan expert on ageing who spoke at 
the conference, said: ‘For an individual, the actual risk of dementia 
seems to have declined.

‘I believe the evidence is pretty strong that
 lifestyle changes, especially increasing physical activity, maintaining
 a healthy weight, eating a healthy Mediterranean diet, and controlling 
one’s blood pressure, can help reduce the risk of dementia.

‘On a 
societal level, increasing opportunities for children to have good 
educations and keep their brains active and stimulated also seems 
important for reducing dementia risk later in life.’

However, Dr Langa pointed out that the ageing population means the total number of cases is still on the rise.

He
 said: ‘The number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble
 in the next 40 years worldwide. This means that dementia is still going
 to be front and centre as a public health issue.’

Others warned that the obesity epidemic could undo the progress.

Previous
 research has shown that those who are obese in middle-age are almost 
four times as likely to develop dementia in old age as those who keep 
their weight in check.

The exact reasons are unknown but high blood 
pressure and cholesterol associated with obesity could interrupt the 
brain’s blood supply, while hormones and other chemicals released by fat
 stores may harm the brain.

Rebecca Wood, chief executive of 
Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘While there is no simple way  to prevent
 the condition, it is positive to see that improvements in  healthcare 
for other conditions could be helping to stem the tide  of dementia.

‘Time will tell whether rising trends in obesity could set back this progress in the coming years.’

Better control of high blood pressure and cholesterol most likely reason

But rates in poorer counties are increasing due to obesity and diabetes
