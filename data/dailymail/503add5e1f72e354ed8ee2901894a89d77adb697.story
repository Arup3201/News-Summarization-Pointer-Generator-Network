It was the 'paw-fect' pre-Halloween party.

After all, dogs can't exactly trick-or-treat.

Hundreds of people dragged their pets along to the New York's Tompkins Square Park this weekend for the 23rd annual Dog Halloween Parade.

And it's safe to say that some of the primed pups were in more elaborate costumes than you'll see on most humans this year.

The East Village park was packed full of terriers, bulldogs, Labradors, pugs and other loveable mutts dressed to the nines.

Winners in different categories howled with pride, taking home Broadway tickets, gift vouchers and doggie treats.

In past years, a golden retriever wearing antlers and a Santa suit pulled a sleigh, a corgi came as a bus stop, a West Highland terrier packed in the spinach for his Olive Oyl and Popeye pet parents, and small dogs dug deep into their inner superstars, appearing as John Lennon, Evel Knievel and even Michael Jackson, complete with one glittering silver bootie, according to USA Today.

This year marked the 23rd annual fundraiser for the dog run located in the park.

Admission was free and attendees could purchase $5 raffle tickets in a chance to win a mini-iPad.

'The event is a way to share hilarious moments with pets and their owners,' said Garrett Rosso, a volunteer manager of the dog park.

'One year all the pugs came as Chinese take-out.

'Martha Stewart liked the costumes so much that she made them for her dogs.'Â
