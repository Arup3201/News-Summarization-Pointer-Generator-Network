A 104-year-old woman received 6,000 birthday cards after a social media campaign became an internet sensation.

Betty Musker was sent cards and gifts sent from all over the world - including Australia, Singapore and China - ahead of her milestone birthday yesterday.

The Liverpool FC fan even had a very special visit from former star Ian Rush yesterday and was given a personalised Liverpool strip and a card signed by the current squad.

Mrs Musker was overwhelmed and surprised all of the cards were for her and said it was 'lovely people had taken the time out the send them'

Due to the overwhelming amount, Mrs Musker's cards had their own designated space at the local post office

Betty's family and staff at Golborn House care home in Warrington, Cheshire, launched the Facebook campaign last month.

They invited people to send cards to the popular great-great-grandmother.

Lorraine Marshall, one of Betty's carers, said: 'I can't bear football, but she's Reds mad.

'She watches every game, she even watched the whole world cup. She's football crazy.

'She's a lovely, lovely lady, and she loves her hometown of Liverpool.

'Betty has made cards all her life, and when I asked her what she wanted for her birthday, she said 'just a nice card, I love cards', and that's how the seed was planted.

'She's completely with it, she knows everything that's going on. But she'll be very surprised when she gets all these cards on her birthday.'

Mrs Musker was born in Liverpool in 1910 and began working for the Dunlop plimsoll company before she married. She then worked at St Paul's Eye Hospital in Liverpool as a nurse before working as a clipper who checked bus tickets. As she got older Mrs Musker became a cleaner for a private company

Mrs Musker told her great-granddaughter Alison Whittle she wanted 'a nice card' for her birthday

Cards have been posted for her from countries including the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia

The campaign, called For the love of Betty Musker, was started after the elderly widow told her carers she did not think she would receive many cards for her birthday

The care home was inundated with well-wishes for the centenarian with around 200 cards arriving every day

The campaign, called For the love of Betty Musker, was started after the elderly widow told her carers that she didn't think she'd get many cards as most of her friends are dead.

The care home was inundated with well-wishes for the centenarian with around 200 cards arriving every day - and people even sent cards addressed simply to 'Betty in Warrington'.

But Betty had no idea that she would be met with such a colossal pile of cards and presents, totalling more than 5,600, after she received just 70 cards last year.

Betty left her beloved Liverpool 10-years-ago so she could live closer to family who could help look after her - but the devoted fan still manages to watch every game.
