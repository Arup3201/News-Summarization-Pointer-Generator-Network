Jason Denayer is not the type to speak in headlines. The young Belgian defender will never use three words when one will suffice. His voice is so quiet it stretches digital technology to its limits.

And yet, sitting in Celtic’s main stand after Saturday’s 2-1 win over Aberdeen, the on-loan defender made a big, brash statement.

Looking ahead to Thursday’s Europa League curtain raiser in Salzburg, the 20-year-old expressed the belief that Ronny Deila’s men could actually reach the final, an honour last achieved at Parkhead in 2003 by a team featuring Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton et al.

Jason Denayer claims that Celtic are good enough to reach the final of the Europa League this year

‘Everyone is disappointed about not getting into the Champions League, because all the supporters and all of the players wanted to be there,’ said the 19-year-old currently on loan from Manchester City.

‘But we can’t focus on the past and say: “That’s bad.” We must concentrate on the Europa League and do all we can do in that competition.

‘If we play as we can, if we play to 100 per cent of our ability, we can go to the final. It’s about us. Celtic is a big club with high expectations and we will try to meet them.’

On the evidence of the season so far, even mentioning Celtic in the same sentence as a Europa League final in Warsaw is strong stuff.

This is a team who have won five of their 11 competitive games so far. A team who are in transition.

Deila’s side have had two cracks at the Champions League and blown them both; a fact that Aberdeen’s travelling support were quick to cast up on Saturday.

One of those attempts, of course, was against Legia Warsaw and ended in a 6-1 defeat, before the most unexpected of UEFA reprieves arrived on a technicality amid much acrimony.

Were Celtic to make it to the Polish capital, then, their green and white shirts would have to be insulated by flak jackets.

There were signs of improvement against Aberdeen, no question. Deila pronounced himself particularly delighted with the return to fitness of captain Scott Brown.

New loan signing Stefan Scepovic was only denied a debut goal by an offside flag. And Aleksandar Tonev had some decent touches long before he was embroiled in disturbing accusations of racism towards Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan.

But Denayer summed up Celtic’s performance perfectly when he said: ‘It’s good, it’s okay.

‘I think we are getting close to how the manager wants us to play. In the first half against Aberdeen, we did very well. The second half was more difficult. We need to train more now, we need time and we will be better.’

At 2-0 ahead after 46 minutes Celtic were coasting, Then, from nowhere, a football match broke out. By time up Aberdeen were nursing a sense of injustice and discontent at their failure to take a point at least.

As in his home league debut against Dundee United, Denayer set the ball rolling early.

A Kris Commons corner in the seventh minute was flicked by an Aberdeen head towards the back post where Efe Ambrose thrashed a volley off his defensive team-mate on the goal-line and into the net.

It was an odd affair, Denayer saying: ‘I remember a little bit about the goal. The ball came to Efe and he took a shot. The ball hit a defender, then hit me and went in the goal. I’m very happy to score two goals in two home games now and it gives me more confidence. I feel good now.’

In control of the game, Celtic made it 2-0 in the first minute of the second half, Callum McGregor’s cut back from the right side picking out Commons, the attacker’s left foot strike deflecting off a luckless Logan and past Jamie Langfield in goal for 2-0.

At which point the game seemed safe. Commons, his future in doubt after his omission from the two European games with Maribor, had proven his value once more.

With half an hour remaining, however, the game finally began to fulfil pre-match expectations.

Aberdeen, the team rated most likely to challenge Celtic this season, began to play. Why it took them so long is the question.

Peter Pawlett produced the first of a string of fine saves from Craig Gordon before David Goodwillie scored his first goal for the club, swooping to nod Andrew Considine’s back post knock down into the net from six yards out.

Suddenly, Aberdeen were back in the game. Their belief was apparent.

Derek McInnes would later describe the home team’s display in the final half hour as ‘vulnerable, agitated and nervy.’ He wasn’t wrong.

The game might easily have swung the way of an invigorated visiting side but for Gordon, fast becoming Celtic’s best piece of transfer business in quite some time.

The Scotland keeper parried Niall McGinn’s thumping shot from 18 yards, then pushed away Willo Flood’s rising long range shot towards the top corner.

Yet Aberdeen were irate when referee Bobby Madden failed to award a penalty when Commons raised his hands to block a McGinn free kick.

McInnes argued the point with the referee on the long walk down the tunnel and did so again vocally in the post-match press conference. Later on, a Dons grievance against Tonev for altogether more serious reasons would make this a trying day for the official.

Raised hands remain one of football’s great grey areas. An incessant bone of contention.

Had they scored a penalty, McInnes believes his team would have won. As it transpired, their last chance to take at least a point passed in 81 minutes when substitute Adam Rooney knocked down a Goodwillie cross and McGinn blazed the ball over the bar.

How Celtic’s shuddering, shaky last half hour display squares with Denayer’s belief that the team have it in them to reach the Europa League final is unclear.

But the Parkhead side can certainly take confidence from the performance of Virgil van Dijk. The Dutch defender was unhappy with the reluctance of the champions to sell him in the final days of the transfer window, but turned in a solid, professional performance to allay concerns over his ongoing levels of commitment.

‘I feel very good playing alongside Virgil,’ said Denayer in admiration afterwards. ‘He speaks to me a lot. He is very calm. When he speaks, it is not aggressively. It is better to speak calmly, we understand each other better that way.

‘Virgil is a very good player and I think he can play at the highest level. I’m very happy he stayed at the club.’

In the final stages of this see-saw football match, they all were.
