On Saturday afternoon, with the sun a-glow and the pitch pristine, India moved without too much fuss in their second innings to 53 for one. 

The remnants of Hurricane Bertha were set to wipe out the fourth day and possibly the fifth. Stuart Broad was in hospital with a broken nose; Jimmy Anderson was struggling with a bug. Survive until stumps, and there was a chance India would have arrived at The Oval this week at 1-1.

What followed was the kind of surrender that gives white flags a bad name. Nine wickets fell in 22 overs – six of them to Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan – and the captain was out slogging to midwicket. MS Dhoni, you see: cool in a crisis.

For India, bowled out twice in the equivalent of a day’s play, there was worse to come. Talking to Mike Atherton, Dhoni insisted he was ‘quite happy’ with his team’s ‘progress’. There is sticking up for your players in public, and there is taking the mick. Dhoni didn’t merely cross that line: he jumped the shark. 

That evening, on Sky’s Verdict show, Ravi Shastri unwittingly revealed one of India’s biggest problems. Instead of taking Dhoni to task, Shastri – a veteran defender of India’s cricket establishment – suggested the captain had simply wanted to escape the interview as quickly as possible. As anyone who has sat through a Dhoni press conference will know, brevity is not his greatest strength.

Not for the first time in India’s long sequence of overseas failures under Dhoni – the win at Lord’s was the notable exception – he was being given an armchair ride.

Since the euphoria of that victory, a result that seems to have used up their entire stock of emotional energy, India have – to adapt Shane Warne’s assessment of Sachin Tendulkar – been third-best in this series, behind England and daylight.

At Southampton and Manchester, they have scored 821 runs for the loss of 40 wickets; England have managed 1,141 runs – in one innings fewer – for the loss of 21 wickets (or 20, if you don’t count Broad’s nasal issues). In other words, India have averaged 20 per wicket to England’s 57. It has become 2011 all over again.

India’s chopping and changing hasn’t helped: England would still rather come up against Gautam Gambhir than Shikhar Dhawan, and the tourists are yet to pick the right bowling combination. Ravindra Jadeja (this summer averaging 22 with the bat and 46 with the ball) appears to owe his selection to the friends he has in high places. 

And they have come up against an England side that has finally woken up to a few harsh truths after sleep-walking through the first half of the season.

Increasingly, the slip catch put down by Jadeja to reprieve Alastair Cook on 15 during the opening session at the Ageas Bowl looks like the turning point of the series – and perhaps, who knows, of a career. Cook made 95, the mood in the dressing-room lifted in homage to a popular captain, and India almost instantly went on the defensive. Cult-hero status for Pankaj Singh is no consolation.

Pair of aces: James Anderson and Stuart Broad are becoming an all-time great double act

Since then, England have just got on with it. One of their smartest decisions was to insulate the players from the Anderson-Jadeja spat. Cricket was the thing, not a waste-of-money inquest. The Indians, by contrast, wouldn’t let it go: Dhoni was still expounding at length on the matter on the eve of the Old Trafford Test. 

It would be too facile to say that India have lost two Tests because they were distracted. Equally, they spent too much time nursing a sense of injustice beyond its proper proportion. As the driving force behind the decision to pursue Anderson, Dhoni has to bear the blame. 

While India fiddled, England fired. Handed a pair of pitches replete with pace and carry, their big names enjoyed themselves. In the last two Tests, Anderson has picked up 12 wickets at 11, Broad nine at 12. Their combined analysis has been 114.5-41-254-21. They are edging into the category of an all-time great double act.

Ian Bell has responded with a sublime 167, a selfless 23 and a classy 58. And Joe Root is starting to bat as if determined to cast himself as a responsibility-bearing senior.

There remain issues, of course, and India’s hopelessness has put a gloss on much of what England have done. Chris Woakes and Jordan have claimed four wickets between them at 84 each (and leaked 3.61 an over), while Sam Robson is one Test away from the axe. But England are rebuilding: what did we expect?

Better, perhaps, to dwell on another trio. For Gary Ballance, Moeen (the off-spinner rather than the batsman, for the time being at least) and Jos Buttler, Test cricket must feel like a ball. Misery-guts are wondering whether they’ll be able to prosper next year against Mitchell Johnson.

After the winter from hell, England will settle for the shoots of spring. Now that’s progress. 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Taking action

One by one, they are being picked off. Back in May, the Top Spin – acting on a tip-off – asked the ICC whether it was ‘right that the actions of several bowlers during the recent World Twenty20 were a concern?’ and whether those bowlers were ‘now being watched closely?’ We were fobbed off with an answer about the fact that no new instructions had been issued to match officials concerning the reporting of illegal actions. Which didn’t really help.

Events since then have explained the evasion. Last month both Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson were banned; now it’s Pakistan’s Saeed Ajmal. All three are off-spinners with a noticeable kink in their action. Since the ICC’s 15-degree rule was brought in because that was said to be the level of flexion visible to the naked eye, it seems due process is being followed.

Conspiracy theorists will note that the umpires who reported Ajmal on the fourth day of the Galle Test against Sri Lanka were Ian Gould and Bruce Oxenford, an Englishman and an Australian – and thus, in many Asian eyes, representatives of the old, white world order. Others will wonder how it took the authorities so long. Either way, the game has finally got serious about elbows which are straightening at the point of delivery. And if you think that’s a conspiracy, you need to get out more.

Only Bradman better

Don Bradman averaged a handy 101 in his 24 Tests as captain. But, for once, he may be shifting uncomfortably in his grave. Angelo Mathews’ double of 91 and 25* as Sri Lanka pinched the Galle Test against Pakistan on Sunday seconds before the heavens opened took his record while captain to 1,304 runs at an average of nearly 87 – compared with a pre-captaincy figure of under 40. Only Bradman lies ahead of him. So much for the burdens of office.

Provincial angst

With three Tests out of seven each summer all but allocated to the London venues for the foreseeable future, the scramble is on among the UK’s seven other Test grounds to stage matches and recoup the millions of pounds the ECB encouraged them to spend on upgrades several years ago – precisely so that they were in a position to hold games which are now increasingly hard to come by.

So it’s a pity the non-London venues have all encountered mishaps this summer. Headingley was always going to struggle to sell tickets against Sri Lanka. The Trent Bridge pitch was rated poor by the ICC. The Ageas Bowl felt half-empty after the opening day. And Old Trafford has a drainage issue. Perhaps the biggest winners have been Edgbaston, Cardiff and Chester-le-Street.

A question of consistency

Cricket Australia has removed from its website a video gleefully detailing the mistakes made by Matt Prior before England replaced him with Jos Buttler. The ECB were said to be unhappy with the tone of the video, but the reason given for its removal was copyright. Still, the thought occurred to one wag on Twitter: will CA now run a montage of MS Dhoni’s blunders behind the stumps this summer? Thought not.
