Jane Seymour as Michaela Mike in the television series Dr Quinn set in Colorado Springs

Since I turned 60 last year, a funny thing has started to happen to my emails. 

I write January when I mean September or use a word that looks like the one I intended but isn't. 

I struggle to stay focused on work and my memory just isn't what it used to be. It’s troubling, and I’m sure I can count myself among the legions of middle-aged worried well, silently fearing our minds may go years before our bodies.

So please forgive my suspension of disbelief when I was invited to try out a US-based spa that claims to be able to ‘anti-age’ the mind, rather than simply pampering the body. 

Never mind it has a Director of Spirituality on its staff. Nor that it offers ‘healing therapy with horses’.

It also has an ex-US Surgeon General on the board, and the plan promises ‘a better brain in 30 days’. The idea of a magic formula to help stave off dementia is irresistible – even if it may mean cutting through a sea of American psychobabble.

WHERE’S THE SOLUTION?

Canyon Ranch was opened 35 years ago in Tucson, Arizona, by a couple determined to embrace New Age therapies as well as Western science. 

It will be familiar to cruise-ship fans, as there are branches on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 as well as the liners of Oceania, Regent Seven Seas and Celebrity Cruises. 

It attracts a slew of well-heeled workaholics and the odd celebrity, including Mad Men’s January Jones, Strictly winner Caroline Flack and Jane Seymour, who famously played Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman.

WHAT’S THE TREATMENT?

The Brain Health and Longevity Programme is delivered over six days. First, former US Surgeon General Dr Richard Carmona delivers some great news: our brains may be shrinking but they are endlessly malleable, capable of building new cells at any age in response to new experiences.

This ‘neuroplasticity’ is bolstered by correct nutrition (Alzheimer’s disease is now called type 3 diabetes in the US because it’s so closely connected with poor sugar metabolism), deeper sleep and regular exercise.

After this comes the unexpected shock of high-intensity interval training in the gym – Dr Carmona says vigorous exercise is vital to get blood flowing to the ageing brain before we put it to the test. Spurred to go hell for leather on the treadmill for 30 seconds at a time, we all agree we feel fantastic afterwards.

I rise at 6.30am the next day for a desert hike. I need a double espresso to make it to the starting point but feel proud of managing two miles before breakfast. This becomes a daily habit, like the yoga classes and meditation.

Animal therapy is well known to reduce blood pressure and stress and increase self-esteem – and a particularly powerful effect has been observed when a variety of patients interact with horses. 

This is why neurosurgeon Dr Allan Hamilton and his psychotherapist wife Jane offer equine-assisted therapy – at £270-plus for a three-hour session, although the cost can be covered by a £800 treatment allowance which is included in the price of a stay.

It’s one of the optional extras the brain-raddled might find useful to help ‘quiet their minds’ (one of the Big Ideas we are exhorted to adopt) but involves no horseback riding. Instead, we spend the session getting a horse to obey our simple commands.

They are such big, powerful animals, it takes a lot of attention to try to get their trust and overcome the fear of being stepped on – a meditation in itself and a shining example of the power of focus. It’s a shame the horses are several miles away on the Hamiltons’ ranch, and that working with them is so expensive.

THE VERDICT?

It’s hard not to feel better after several days in a sublime location, breathing fresh air and eating tasty organic food in an alcohol-free environment. I’ve managed three gym visits a week since returning, for the first time working up a sweat thanks to high-intensity training.

At the ranch, Spiritual Wellness Director Julie Haber told me to create ‘a sacred space’ at home – a comfortable corner to retreat to with candles and cushions when I need to get my mojo back.

Well, I have not yet decluttered or knowingly meditated, but now that I think about it I’m not feeling as scatty, forgetful or stressed and I think the exercise must have a lot to do with that. 

I’m still making those inadvertent typos, though – but I have been reassured by experts this is a common sign of ageing, not a predictor of serious mental decline.

The Mint Breathometer will analyse the levels of volatile sulphur compounds in your mouth

Phone gadget that's a breath of fresh air

Most of us rely on close friends or family to tell us when we have smelly breath, but a new gadget developed by scientists in the US and unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas lets your smartphone break the bad news. 

Simply place your lips on the pocket-sized device, called a Mint Breathometer, right, and it will analyse the levels of volatile sulphur compounds (the primary cause of halitosis) in your mouth.

It will then send the results to a phone app via Bluetooth. The device, available to buy from August, can also tell you whether you are drinking enough water.

Hot cuppa worsens hot flushes

Hot flushes are one of the most dreaded symptoms of the menopause. Now new medical research has confirmed what many women have suspected all along: that a morning cup of coffee can make them worse.

Experts at the Mayo Clinic in the United States found that 85 per cent of women who suffered hot flushes also consumed high amounts of caffeine in tea, coffee and fizzy drinks.

Do you know your glutes from your elbow? If so, you are in the minority as a new study has revealed that three out of four Britons have little or no idea what muscle groups they are working during exercise. 

A survey of 2,000 adults by Virgin Active gyms found 50 per cent don’t know what their triceps are, and almost a tenth of people wrongly believe the glutes are found in the stomach, not their bottom. 

Londoners proved the most knowledgeable when it came to locating basic muscle groups, while people from the West Midlands fared the worst. 

Experts at Coventry University have designed a phone app that offers advice to people on how to prevent falls at home.

Fallcheck provides information on potential hazards alongside tips on how to stop accidents happening, such as removing a rug. 

About a third of people aged 65 and over suffer at least one fall a year. 

PREVENT

‘If your throat starts to feel sore, take it easy to allow your immune system time to deal with it,’ advises Luke Cascarini, consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at BMI The Sloane Hospital and head and neck surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in London.

‘Eat healthily, stay well hydrated and avoid late nights and shift work. If you are on an extreme exercise programme, such as training for a marathon, give it a rest till you feel better as overdoing it may suppress your immune system.’

TREAT

Painkillers and plenty of fluids are the first line of treatment before heading to the GP, says Mr Cascarini. ‘Don’t be tempted to head straight to the doctors to get signed off work. 

Paracetamol will ease the pain and also help reduce a high temperature. You’d be amazed how many people refuse to take basic painkillers – but think of it as being thirsty and not drinking water.’

A sore throat should pass in three to seven days. And even if you do decide to make a GP appointment, it’s unlikely you’ll be given antibiotics. 

This is because most sore throats are not caused by bacteria, so antibiotics will have little effect.

DON’T BOTHER

Although hot toddies are seen as a warming, grown-up alternative to traditional over-the-counter sore-throat remedies, Mr Cascarini warns that they could end up doing you more harm than good. 

‘Alcohol dehydrates you and drinking anything too hot could irritate your throat, so you could end up feeling worse, not better,’ he says.
