Ashley Roberts has turned her hand to designing once again and is hoping her latest range of pretty party dresses will offer ladies something to wear for every occasion this season.

The former Pussycat Doll has unveiled her new range for Key Fashion and even channels Marilyn Monroe in the campaign imagery.

Speaking to MailOnline about the collection, 32-year-old Ashley said: 'It's colourful and fun with lots of dresses in different styles for any girl.

Marilyn, is that you? Ashley Roberts channels Miss Monroe in her new campaign for Key Fashion (The Goddess dress, £495, is her favourite piece from the range)

'There's long beautiful dresses for bridesmaids, fun flirty ones for dances, as well as frocks for holidays and date nights.'

Ashley explains that all of her dresses have all been made using quality fabrics and 
prints with elaborate embellishment to give them a glamorous edge.

Ashley, who cites Nichole Ritchie as her style icon, says her favourite piece from the range is the Goddess dress, which she describes as a 'stand-out piece' that she's excited to wear at an upcoming event.

Speaking about her style evolution, the Dancing On Ice judge explained: 'My style has evolved due to loving new styles that come into play but I can always go back to a black skinny jean and black leather jacket and feel happy in my down time.'

Ashley isn't the only former Pussy Cat Doll to turn her hand to designing - Nicole Scherzinger recently unveiled a range for Missguided.

Mellow yellow: Ashley says she loves Nicole Ritchie's style because she 'always gets it right' (dress, £220)

'I am happy for Nic!,' said Ashley. ' Her dresses look fun. We don't usually share style tips with each other. If we catch up it's usually about life and boys.'

Aside from designing, Ashley recently launched her debut perfume.

'I am also about to launch my music. I have been in the studio recording for the last year and am so excited to get back to my roots.'

Speaking about her plans for the future, Ashley said: 'In five years time I hope to have a successful solo career, I'd love to do a romantic comedy film, have my own range of fashion, a healthy and happy relationship, a house by the water, more involvement with my charities and just living a happy life.'

Grand plans: Ashley has also re-released a fragrance and has plans to re-launch her pop career in the coming months (£160)
