Police have released a video of their interview with the accused gunman in June’s deadly shooting at Seattle Pacific University (SPU), including  an admission that he found it ‘so fun’.

Aaron R. Ybarra, 27, of Mountlake Terrace, Washington, opened fire at the university on June 5th killing Paul Lee, 19, a freshman, and injuring Sarah Williams, 19, and Thomas Fowler, 24.

He was stopped by Jon Meis, a student building monitor, who pepper-sprayed him and grabbed the shotgun Ybarra was carrying, before helping another student hold him down until police arrived.

In the newly released video of police questioning Ybarra, he talked openly about his enjoyment at firing the first round.

‘You’re like, I can’t believe that I’m doing this, but once you do it, you’re like: “Oh my God, it’s so fun.”’

Aaron R. Ybarra was questioned by Seattle police in the hours after the shooting at Seattle Pacific University and described shooting his first victim as 'so fun'

During the interview Ybarra spoke openly about his mental problems, feelings of hatred, and how he had stopped taking his prescription medication and seeing his psychotherapist

He described struggling with with mental problems since he was a child and developed obsessive compulsive disorder. He developed routines, including one involving his bedroom furniture, and after his parents changed the furniture in his room, he became overcome with feelings of hatred.

His compulsions went from good to evil he said. 

Ybarra had been seeing a psychotherapist for his OCD and transient psychosis, but stopped attending sessions. He began drinking on a daily basis and stopped taking his prescriptions of Prozac and Risperdal.

‘I stopped because I was stubborn and I wanted to feel my hate. Plus I didn’t think it was working... I was thinking “what’s the point of being good when the world’s against me.”’

Ybarra, pictured appearing at his arraignment, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder. When interviewed by police he said: ‘I was meaning to die… but I got caught instead'

In the video Ybarra talks of feeling nothing but 100 per cent hatred towards the world, and that he didn’t even feel remorse for his actions.

‘I don’t get respect from people, they don’t take me seriously. When I was growing up people wouldn’t take me seriously, they would laugh at me.’

In the time leading up to the SPU shooting he said he increasingly began identifying with the perpetrators of the shootings at Columbine and Virginia Tech.

On June 5th he packed a knife, a shotgun and 75 rounds and drove to SPU.

Otto Miller Hall on the Seattle Pacific University campus, where Ybarra intended to take hostages in a suicide mission that ended with him shooting three students on June 5

‘I’d been planning the attack at SPU because I had to stay local. Washington State University was supposed to be the main target. I wasn’t really targeting anyone specifically. I just had hatred towards the world, but I didn’t want to attack my own city.’

The victim: Paul Lee, 19, a freshman, was shot dead, while fellow students Sarah Williams, 19, and Thomas Fowler, 24, were injured

He also revealed how he planned out the attack, touring the campus two weeks beforehand.

‘I used two girls to give me a private tour. I didn’t have to ask, I acted like a transfer student and the way I approached them made them want to give me a tour.’

Speaking about the day of the attack, Ybarra revealed that his intention was to take hostages at Otto Miller Hall on the SPU campus.

‘I was trying to hold two people hostage, just to have a little fun, but they didn’t take me seriously, they were laughing at me… I said hey, you two get inside… this one girl and one guy. They were talking to each other. They were just standing there laughing at me.

'And then I pointed to that one guy that I shot and I said: “Hey you. Get inside,” and he said: “Haha, you think you can scare me with that thing?”’

‘That’s when I got mad, and I was going to shoot people anyway, and I was really mad at him for doing that… that was the first guy that I shot, when he turned his back.’

Ybarra shot Paul Lee in the back of the head with a double-barreled shotgun outside Otto Miller Hall. Some of the shot pellets struck Thomas Fowler, who was standing several feet away.

He tried to shoot a woman nearby, but the gun misfired and she escaped.

Ybarra then entered the building, turning the gun on student Sarah Williams, who was coming down some stairs.

'I said: “I don’t want to have to hurt you”. She laughed at me too and just kept walking. That made me mad too.’

Williams was wounded, and as Ybarra tried to reload, Meis made his move disarming and restraining him until police arrived.

During the his interview with police Ybarra explained: ‘If I had a choice to not feel this way I wouldn’t have done this. I wouldn’t have wanted to kill people. I wanted to live a happy successful life, but my hate got in my way. The compulsiveness was overcoming me.’

‘I was meaning to die… but I got caught instead.’

Despite the statements made in the police interview, Ybarra has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder.
