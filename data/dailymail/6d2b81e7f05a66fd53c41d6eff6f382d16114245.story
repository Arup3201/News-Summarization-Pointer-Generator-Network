Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities remained without access to CBS on Sunday, meaning they could miss Tiger Woods' attempt to win the Bridgestone Invitational.

The cable provider cut off CBS for viewers in those markets on Friday, saying the network is demanding retransmission fees that are out of line with what it pays other broadcasters.

CBS says it's never been dropped by a cable provider before and that it has successfully negotiated deals with other providers including AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon.

A spokeswoman for Time Warner, Maureen Huff, said Sunday that 'talks continue.' A representative for CBS declined to comment on the status of the negotiations.

The two New York-based companies have been taking their cases to the public, with full-page print ads in local papers.

Time Warner Cable customers who turned to CBS this weekend were also greeted by a message on white screen saying the network had made 'outrageous demands' for fees. It advised viewers that they could still see their favorite shows through several ways, including 'using an antenna to get CBS free over the air.'

Although CBS sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna, about 85 per cent of CBS viewers watch TV through a pay TV provider.

CBS is trying to gain revenue from retransmission fees as a buffer against swings in advertising revenue. Analysts say earning revenue from pay TV subscribers is crucial to the network's growth prospects.

Time Warner, meanwhile, says giving in to demands for higher fees would result in skyrocketing bills for customers. DirecTV came to the defense of its competitor, saying it applauded Time Warner for 'fighting back against exorbitant programming cost increases.'

Time Warner is trying to hold down 
costs as it fights to keep subscribers. In the most recent quarter, it 
lost 191,000 cable TV subscribers, ending with 11.7 million at the end 
of June.

Both companies nevertheless posted healthy quarterly 
earnings this week. Time Warner Cable Inc. grew its net income six per cent
to $481 million, as revenue rose three per cent to $5.55 billion. CBS Corp. 
grew net income 11 per cent to $472 million on stronger revenue.

Time Warner said Friday that CBS refused to have 
productive negotiations, which were repeatedly extended after their 
previous deal expired at the end of June.

'It's
become clear that no matter how much time we give them, they're not 
willing to come to reasonable terms,' Time Warner Cable said.

CBS
said it regretted Time Warner Cable's decision, calling it 
'ill-advised.' The broadcaster said it asked for an extension, but that 
Time Warner Cable didn't agree to it.

Most
of the cable subscribers affected live in New York, Los Angeles and 
Dallas, but customers in other markets also lost signals.

The CBS stations that went dark are 
WCBS and WLNY in New York; KCBS and KCAL in Los Angeles; KTVT and KTXA 
in Dallas; WBZ and WSBK in Boston; KDKA, WPCW-CW in Pittsburgh; KCNC in 
Denver; WKBD-CW in Detroit and WBBM in Chicago.

About
2.5 million Time Warner Cable customers also lost access to Showtime, 
the premium channel that carries shows such as 'Dexter.' TMC, FLIX and 
Smithsonian channels - all owned by CBS Corp. - also went dark.

In
its message to subscribers, Time Warner Cable said it would replace the
lost programming with shows from Starz Kids and Family temporarily.

The
fight centers on the rising fees that TV station owners like CBS charge
cable and satellite companies to retransmit their content. Research 
firm SNL Kagan estimates retransmission fees will reach $3 billion 
industry-wide this year and double to $6 billion by 2018.

SNL Kagan analyst Robin Flynn said that figure could be revised upward soon as TV station groups merge to gain leverage at the bargaining table. For example, Tribune Co. announced plans to buy Local TV to form a group of 42 TV stations last month.

Earning revenue from pay TV subscribers is crucial to CBS's growth prospects, analysts say.

Even though CBS sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna, about 85 per cent of its viewers watch TV through a pay TV provider. Such fees ensure the company is not so reliant on advertising dollars, which rise and fall with the economy.

Meanwhile, Time Warner Cable is fighting to hold the line on costs as it struggles to keep subscribers. It lost 191,000 cable TV subscribers in the most recent quarter, ending with 11.7 million at the end of June.

Even as the dispute lingered on, both companies posted healthy quarterly earnings this week.

Time Warner Cable subscribers are set to miss out on the chance to watch Tiger Woods at the PGA Championship as a result of the dispute

Time Warner Cable grew its net income six per cent to $481 million, or $1.64 per share, as revenue rose three per cent to $5.6 billion.

CBS
grew net income 11 percent to $472 million, or 76 cents per share. 
CBS's revenue also grew 11 percent to $3.7 billion thanks in large part 
to the fees that are in dispute with Time Warner Cable.

Jonathan
Atkin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said TV distributors are 
taking a stand because programming costs are going up about 10 per cent 
this year, an increase that's too high to pass onto customers.

'They feel pressure when some of these cost drivers are going up the way they are,' Atkin said.

'They do need to show some teeth and try to negotiate something better.'

He
said the dispute would probably end quickly to avoid depriving 
customers of key sporting events, like the PGA Championship starting on 
Thursday. CBS also airs its first pre-season NFL game August 23.
