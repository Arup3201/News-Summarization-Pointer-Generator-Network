A police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife at their home in Northampton - just yards away from his force's headquarter.

Police Constable Otis Goldsmith, 49, was taken into custody yesterday afternoon on suspicion of murdering his wife Jill, also 49.

She and PC Goldsmith were married in May last year and lived together at his £140,000 semi-detached property, less than a mile from Northamptonshire Police's HQ at Wootton Hall.

Today, PC Goldsmith's elderly mother Sylvia and father Michael, both 81, who live in nearby Rushden, Northamptonshire, expressed their distress at their son's arrest.

Mrs Goldsmith said: 'We don't know any details about what happened but Otis has been arrested.

'He and Jill only married last year. This is a very difficult time for us all.' 

PC Goldsmith has three sons from a previous marriage, twins aged 17 and another aged 20. His wife, a former domestic cleaner, is believed to have had a 22-year-old son from a previous marriage.

The officer's ex-wife Catherine Goldsmith, 52, the mother to his children, also confirmed he had been arrested on suspicion of murder.

When asked if she was aware her ex-husband had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mrs Goldsmith, who lives in Northampton, said: 'Yes.'

Police are expected to ask for more time to question PC Goldsmith over the alleged murder

She added: 'I've been told by the police to tell people who call me to please contact the police.' 

Detectives are expected to ask for more time to question PC Goldsmith, while they await the results of a post mortem examination, which was carried out this afternoon, to confirm the cause of Mrs Goldsmith’s death.

Officers were called to the property in Wootton Hall Park shortly after 1pm yesterday where the arrest was made.

The officer, who has served with the force for 28 years, was said to be off-duty at the time of the alleged offence. 

Northamptonshire Police said PC Goldsmith had served as a detective constable in CID for a number of years before moving back to being a PC. There is no difference in rank.  

Speaking outside the officer's house today, Superintendent Christopher Hillery said: 'I would like to offer mine and Northamptonshire Police's condolences to the family and friends of the victim of this incident. 

'We were called to a private address at Wootton Hill Park just after 1pm yesterday and arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder.  

'I can now confirm the man arrested is Police Constable Otis Goldsmith, an off-duty officer from Northamptonshire Police.'

He added: 'Otis Goldsmith has served with Northamptonshire Police for more than 28 years.

'What has happened has understandably shocked and upset many people in the local community, and again I would like to offer our sincere condolences to all those affected.'  

The road of about 30 semi-detached houses is on the same site as Northamptonshire Police HQ Wootton Hall. 

They were formerly owned by Northamptonshire Police before being sold off privately and many were bought by serving and retired officers.

Today, the house was cordoned off, with a police officer on guard. A black Renault Espace people carrier was also cordoned off on the green outside the house, where the downstairs curtains were drawn.  

Neighbours of PC Goldsmith  described him as 'a really good guy' who had lived on the street for at least 15 years. 

PC Goldsmith was presented with the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in May 2009. 

He was pictured with Sir John Robinson, Vice Lord Lieutenant for Northamptonshire, who presented him with the award at the police HQ in Northampton. 

Resident Gary McBain, 58, said: 'Otis is a good guy. I have been here since 1999 and they had been living here for a while then. 

'We know him quite well, as do the whole street. All the children used to play outside on the green when they were growing up. So it is a close community.

'Otis has been in the police force for at least 20 years. I am not sure who has died or what has happened exactly. 

'But Otis is a really good guy. Everyone on this street will tell you that.' 

He added: 'He has several children from several marriages. He has a few children.

'This is a highly sensitive area. People here generally know each other. 

'These houses were sold and most of the people living in them now are either retired or serving police officers.' 

A retired officer, who lives nearby, said: 'It happened at lunchtime. We have been advised not to talk about it.'

They added: 'It must have been lunchtime when they cordoned it all off.

'I didn't hear anything but saw them out of the window. We are used to seeing police cars on this road so it isn't unusual but I knew it was serious when there was a cordon. 

'The incident happened at number 11 and I understand the officer arrested was Mr Goldsmith.' 

Another neighbour added: 'He is known as Otis, but I think his first name is Adrian. 

'He's been in the force a long time and is close to retirement. All I will say about him is that he is a good guy.'  

Meanwhile, shocked neighbours who lived next door to Jill for 12 years at her previous address in Northampton described her as a 'lovely and friendly' woman.

The couple said Jill had one child from a previous relationship, a grown up son in his 20s, named Charlie.

The male neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'She was a cleaner but she had stopped working just before she sold the house.

'She moved about 18 months to the police house. I understand Otis had worked with the police a very long time.

'She had been seeing him for perhaps a year before she moved. He never lived there but would stop overnight once or twice a week.

'So they must have been living together in Wootton Hall Park for nearly two years now.'

His wife added: 'Jill was a lovely woman. She was really lovely. She was very friendly as well.

'I am shocked. It is terrible news. She was so nice. She congratulated us when we got married.

'I think Otis had four or five children. I know she had a son called Charlie. It's an absolute tragedy.

'This should have been their honeymoon period. It's desperately sad news.'

During his career with the force, PC Goldsmith has been vocal in his fight against street robberies.

In June 2003 he led a campaign in Northampton urging people to keep an eye on their possessions during the summer months.

Speaking at the time, he told the BBC: 'I would like to reassure people that we have taken a number of measures such as increasing patrols in a bid to deal with this, but I would ask people to think about their own personal safety and be streetwise.

'The fear of crime is often much greater than any risk of becoming a victim, but it is a good opportunity for us to remind people of the need to be sensible and take care of themselves and their property.' 

The force said the murder investigation will not include anyone from Northamptonshire Police and will instead be led by an East Midlands Special Operations Unit, headed by Detective Superintendent Kate Meynell.

The case has already been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.   

Detective Superintendent Kate Meynell, who is heading up the investigation, said: 'A full and proper investigation is taking place. Northamptonshire Police will not be making any further comment on this investigation at this stage.' 

Anyone with any information can call Northamptonshire Police on 101.
