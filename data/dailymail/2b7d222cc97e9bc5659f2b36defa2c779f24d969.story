Chelsea old boy Frank Lampard admitted he was almost speechless after coming off the bench to deny former boss Jose Mourinho victory at Manchester City.

The 36-year-old midfielder, who was serenaded by the visiting fans at the Etihad Stadium, struck five minutes from time after being picked out by James Milner to cancel out Andre Schurrle's 71st-minute opener.

Lampard told Sky Sports: 'It's a really difficult one. I'd be unprofessional if I didn't come on and do my job, so I was trying to get into the box and it was a great ball back from Milly.

The City midfielder looked close to tears after scoring a crucial goal against his former club

'It's a tough one for me. I had 13 amazing years with the Chelsea fans, so I am mixed with it. I am obviously pleased the team I play for got a draw.

'I am a little lost for words. I didn't expect to come on and score like that. I came on and the Chelsea fans were singing, and that's emotional. Then I am playing for this club, who have taken me in brilliantly as well, so I am really stuck in the middle here.'

Delighted City boss Manuel Pellegrini insisted he had no qualms about using Lampard after speaking to him before the game, during which City defender Pablo Zabaleta was dismissed for a second bookable offence. 

Lampard cannot bring himself to celebrate the all-important goal, his first for his new side, against Chelsea

Chelsea's travelling fans, though disappointed by the defeat, stayed behind to applaud their hero

He said: 'I asked him if he wanted to be involved, and of course he wanted to be involved. That shows how great a professional Lampard is.

'I am sure he was not happy to score against such an important team in his career, but he's a good professional, he is a very good player.'

Opposite number Jose Mourinho, for whom Lampard was such a key figure during his first spell at Stamford Bridge, was pragmatic about the former England midfielder's contribution.

Mourinho said: 'He is a Man City player. I don't believe in these histories of passion and heart, I don't believe in these. Maybe I am too pragmatic in football.

'When he decided to come to Man City, a direct competitor of Chelsea, love stories are over. He did his job as the super professional he is, and he did well.'

Despite scoring against them, Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, remains a legend to their fans

Lampard's former teammates Branislav Ivanovic and Andre Schurrle have seen him score all too often

The former England star looked apologetic as he refused to celebrate, and then applauded both sets of fans
