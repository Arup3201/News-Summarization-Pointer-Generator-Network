Team news 

Queens Park Rangers

QPR will welcome top goalscorer Charlie Austin back from suspension for their Barclays Premier League clash against West Brom.

The striker missed the 3-1 defeat at Everton having been sent off against former club Burnley but will be back to spearhead the Hoops' attack on Saturday.

Steven Caulker is also in contention after sitting out the Everton game due to a head injury suffered at the players' Christmas function.

Mauricio Isla will be absent as he has returned home to Chile for the birth of his child and long-term injury casualties Sandro and Alejandro Faurlin (both knee) are not close to a return.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Murphy, Traore, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Dunne, Caulker, Yun, Hill, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Phillips, Kranjcar, Hoilett, Austin, Zamora.

West Brom will welcome back captain Chris Brunt for the trip to QPR after he overcame a hamstring injury.

The skipper had missed the last two games but is fit again for the game at Loftus Road.
