Now that Kimye have secured their dynasty (over to you, baby North), it's time to concentrate on the impending nuptials. And we can only imagine they're going to be erring on the side of fancy.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are already rumoured to be inquiring into the feasibility of hiring out the Palace of Versaille in Paris for their big day.Â 

(Not that they're bothered about the cost of such a venue: 36-year-old West and his fiancee Kim, 33, are, according to Us Weekly, 'not working with a budget'.)

And in keeping with the regal motif, the latest Hollywood buzz is that the blushing bride would like her dress to look exactly like the Alexander McQueen gown Kate Middleton wore for her wedding to Prince William.

'Kim is absolutely obsessed with everything Kate and William do. She considers her own family "American royalty".

'Kim loves Kate's style and while she is planning on several gowns for her big day, she wants the one for the ceremony to look something like Kate's dress,' a source reported to Grazia magazine.

Another whispering is that socialite Kim and her musician beau, whose daughter North is six months old - are to sit on golden thrones during their reception.

'They think it would be really cool to have gold thrones to sit on during the reception. They have already got a Buckingham Palace-themed room in their new home, which they are using as inspiration.'

Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, who already have a six-month-old daughter called North, are rumoured to be considering Paris' Palace of Versailles as a venue for their wedding
