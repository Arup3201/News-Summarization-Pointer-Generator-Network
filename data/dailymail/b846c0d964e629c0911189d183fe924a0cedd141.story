These are the horrific injuries a great-grandmother suffered when she fell on a street after being dazzled by new patterns in the pavement.

Anne Heenan, 74, was walking along New Street in the centre of Grimsby when she slipped on the kerb, which she failed to spot because the colour scheme leaves it 'virtually invisible'.

Mrs Heenan, a retired factory worker from Waltham, Lincolnshire, suffered a broken nose, twisted ankle ligaments and a severely bruised face as a result and is scared of going back into the town.

New design: Anne Heenan, 74, was walking along New Street in Grimsby when she slipped on the kerb. She says she failed to spot the gap because of the new colour scheme

Terrified: The great-grandmother from Waltham, Lincolnshire, is now scared to go back into the town

The street has recently re-opened as a shared space, where the pavement and the road both have the same block-paved surface.

But North East Lincolnshire Council is now facing calls to review the revamp because of safety concerns.

Mrs Heenan, whose face is still badly bruised three weeks after the ordeal, believes the lack of visual distinction between the two is dangerous and needs to be addressed.

She said: 'I think it’s terrible. It is dangerous because you can’t differentiate between the road and the pavement. I think they should do something, paint a white line, anything.'

More than 50 people have signed an 
online petition urging the council to make the drop from the pavement to
 the road more visible.

Slip: Mrs Heenan suffered a broken nose and horrific facial injuries as a result of the fall

Pattern: The street has recently re-opened as a shared space, where the pavement and the road both have the same patterned surface

But
 the council says that although some pedestrians are having difficulty 
identifying the kerb, the new arrangement is satisfactory 
overall.

Mrs Heenan has sent a letter of complaint to North East Lincolnshire Council about the incident, but says she has yet to receive a reply.

She was walking with her daughter and her partner, who had travelled over from America, when she suffered the fall.

It was the second time she has walked in the area since the new pavement was unveiled, having previously been down it with a friend, but crucially this time she was on the outside of the pavement.

Fears: Mrs Heenan, pictured with her dog Rambo, also twisted a ligament when she lost her footing

Old layout: Pedestrians could differentiate between the road and the pavement before the changes

Aggrieved: The grandmother, who was walking with her daughter at the time, sent a letter of complaint to North East Lincolnshire Council

‘My foot went down the side, I banged 
my head and broke my nose.

'My daughter and her partner picked me up and a
 gentleman from the solicitors nearby took me into his office and sat me
 down,’ she added.

An 
ambulance was called and Mrs Heenan was checked over by paramedics.

She went 
to accident and emergency at Grimsby’s Diana, Princess Of Wales Hospital
 the next day.

Since the fall, Mrs Heenan has avoided walking in the town centre on her own.

She added: ‘The doctor said I had broken my nose and that I was lucky because it was straight and it wouldn’t need surgery.

‘I had twisted my right foot and pulled a ligament. It’s not too bad now but it was very, very painful.

‘I’m all right now, but I’m still very nervous about walking on the pavements in the town centre.

‘If I go with my friend I’m all right but I have not been up on my own since - I really don’t like going into town.’

A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: ‘We can confirm we have received Mrs Heenan’s complaint.

'It will be addressed through the usual channels and she will be informed of the outcome.’

East Midlands Ambulance Service said that there had been no significant increase in call-outs to injuries caused by falls in the town centre since the new paving had been installed.

However, in January, local authorities in Grimsby were warned that 'hypnotic' patterns on Freeman Street could give pedestrians epileptic fits and confuse people with dementia.

Councillor Steve Beasent, who suffers from 
epilepsy, said at the time: 'It is a risk to anyone who suffers with photosensitive 
epilepsy. It's not just strobe lights that can trigger seizures; 
patterns and shapes can cause it.'

A spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Falls Collaborative said the group had 'real areas of concern' about the potential risks in the area.

Concerns: Freeman Street, also in Grimsby town centre, has been given a similar makeover - and in January its patterned slabs were branded a risk because of their 'hypnotic pattern'

The blocks also came under fire 
from businesses, residents and taxi drivers, many of whom have branded them a 'waste of money'.

The case is similar to West Derby Street in Liverpool, where three pedestrians received pay-outs because of slips and falls in 2010.

Individuals were paid sums of £2,000, £6,000, £12,876 and £14,225, depending on the nature of their injuries.

In 2012 authorities in Bolton splashed out £13,500 for an anti-algae treatment after a pavement was causing people to slide in the town centre's historic Churchgate.
