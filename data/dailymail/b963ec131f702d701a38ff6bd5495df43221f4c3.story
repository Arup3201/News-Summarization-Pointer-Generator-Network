These are the squalid conditions a vulnerable pensioner was found in, covered in faeces and surrounded by rubbish, after she was left frightened and alone by her own daughter.

Police found Rita Holroyd, 79, from Hartlepool, covered in sores in a single bed after social services raised concerns about her welfare.

She was surrounded by cat dirt, litter, half-eaten food and unwashed food containers when she was found by police.

Pensioner Rita Holroyd was left to live in squalid conditions by her daughter Christine Holroyd, who has now been sentenced to three months in jail, suspended for a year

The pensioner was found when police broke into the property in Hartlepool after a tip-off from worried neighbours

The pensioner had been left in the bed in the front room of the house by her daughter Christine Holroyd.

She was found when police broke into the property in Hartlepool after a tip-off from worried neighbours.

Officers had to climb over bags of rubbish to reach the pensioner who had been left a drink in a child's cup but did not have the strength to pick it up.

Christine Holroyd, 61, was charged with neglect but magistrates heard that a nurse visited her mother 'two or three weeks' before the police search and had no concerns with the state of the home.

Alan Davison, prosecuting, said: 'Rita Holroyd is an elderly lady who lived alone at the time.

'A concerned neighbour contacted social services and police after becoming concerned for her welfare.

'Police gained access to the rear of the property and had to climb over several bags of rubbish to make their way to her.

'She was in a single bed in the front room, lying on her back.

'She was unable to sit up, and was covered in urine and faeces. Her hair was matted with her own faeces.

'The carpets were filthy. There was a child's cup near the bed, but she couldn't physically raise it to her mouth.

'She was taken to hospital, once a pathway had been cleared through the rubbish to get her out, and her skin was covered in sores.

'When she was taken into hospital, her hair had to be cut off as it was too matted. The pensioner remained in hospital for two months, and was then admitted into a care home.'

Mr Davison added: 'She was seen by a nurse at her home two or three weeks prior to this incident for a vitamin injection, and there were no concerns raised by the nurse at that time. But she was deemed to have no capacity for self-care.'

John Relton, defending, said: 'There were no concerns over circumstances in the house when the nurse visited. This was brought to a head when my client's work changed.

'Her mother was very distrusting of third party help and support because of a previous experience when her engagement and wedding rings were stolen from her house.

'My client had her own health problems at the same time, which led to her not seeing the scale of the problem in front of her.

'She has a brother and sister out of town. She should have asked for help. She thought they were coping, but they weren't.'

Mr Relton added that the mother and daughter's relationship had not been affected by the lack of care.

Chairman of the bench Keith Kitching sentenced Christine Holroyd to three months in jail, suspended for a year, for ill treating or wilfully neglecting a person without capacity.

He said: 'We have seen the probation report which is, in parts, quite distressing to read. The lady in question here was left in this condition for a lengthy period of time and she shouldn't have been.

'There is nothing wrong with asking for external help. It is refreshing to hear she is now in residential care.'

Holroyd, of Hartlepool, was also ordered to pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge and given a 12-month supervision order.
