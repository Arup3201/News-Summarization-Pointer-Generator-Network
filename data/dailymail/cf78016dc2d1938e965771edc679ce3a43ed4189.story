She was once the darling of the pop industry, selling millions of albums and performing to packed-out stadiums.

But in the decade since she first topped the charts, it seems Britney Spears may have lost her sparkle – and a fair chunk of her fan base.

The 29-year-old opened her latest UK tour on Thursday night to an almost half-empty arena, according to spectators.

Baring (almost) all: Britney kicked off the London leg of her UK tour at the O2 last night with a selection of risque costumes

Far from full: London's 02 Arena ten minutes before the show gets under way

And the American singer apparently 
did little to dispel her recent reputation for lacklustre performances, 
reportedly singing only one song live in its entirety, the ballad Don’t 
Let Me Be The Last To Know, and dancing lethargically.

There was one more familiar note to the show, though – the skimpy costumes.

Appearing noticeably fuller-figured 
than on previous tours, the mother of two donned a number of revealing 
outfits at the 02 Arena in London, including a pink basque with tights 
and a bejewelled bra top paired with shorts.

It has been reported that hundreds of tickets have failed to sell for her Femme Fatale tour.

And in the run up to it, Miss Spears, 
whose first single got to number one in 1999, has faced criticism over 
scenes in the video for her new single Criminal, in which she brandishes
a gun in riot-ravaged Hackney, East London.

All together now: One one rare occasion Britney's dancers' ensembles matched hers

Coming off: As usual it didn't take long for the singer to remove her jacket

Angelic?
Britney sang a ballad backed by huge white feathered wings - at odds 
somewhat with her black stage leotard, boots and fishnets

Getting close: Britney's dancers looked ready to devour the star in her pink pleather suit
