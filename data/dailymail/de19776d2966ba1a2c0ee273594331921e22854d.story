Three of Arsenal's key defensive players showed they are ready for a busy festive period as they joined in with carol singers at the club's training ground.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, centre back Per Mertesacker and holding midfielder Mathieu Flamini were accosted by the singers as part of BT Sport's new Christmas football marketing campaign.

Szczesny is given a blast of the classic 'shall we sing a song for you?', but looks surprised before walking away.

Flamini, despite looking somewhat confused, offered the singers a wave when they came into the dressing room, but it was Mertesacker who steals the show in the new adverts.

The German, who is set to captain Arsenal through the Christmas period, in the continued absence of Mikel Arteta, joins in with the singers' chants of 'Big Festive German', a play on his nickname at the Emirates stadium.

The Gunners stars also revealed their favourite Christmas songs, with Mertesacker a big fan of Wham's classic 'Last Christmas', while Szczesny prefers 'Rocking around the Christmas Tree'.

Flamini and Szczesny both agreed that Santi Cazorla would be the best choice of Aresnal player to be Santa Claus, because of his tendency to put on a bit of weight during holidays.

The advert is the second featuring BT Sport's Christmas choir - another shows the group outside a house singing songs often heard on the terraces at Manchester United and Chelsea games.

PER MERTESACKER

Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus?

We have a lovely chef who would love to be Santa Claus! There's no particular player who could be a good Santa Claus!

What's your favorite thing about Christmas?

In Germany we celebrate on Christmas Eve and in England you celebrate on 25 December so in England, now I have two days to celebrate, so its an extra Christmas for me.

What's top of your Christmas list this year?

I want to stay as healthy as possible until the last day of this year. And then I'm going to try to put my focus on family time. I will be there for my family and take care of them.

Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad?

I just concentrate on celebrating my Christmas!

What's your favourite Christmas song?

'Last Christmas', it comes up every Christmas and is kind of a one hit wonder and is loved by everyone!

Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing?

You can't go crazy. You can celebrate but you have to always be aware that there's going to be a match one or two days after Christmas. So really we're focused on the next games. I try as much as I can to celebrate with the family and to feel that its Christmas time. Time to relax and I really look forward to it.

MATHIEU FLAMINI

Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus?

Santi Cazorla. That would be funny. We have a chef, the cook, who really looks like Santa Claus. Or Santi.

What's your favorite thing about Christmas?

The best thing is the opportunity to be together with the family and be with family members that we cannot always see during the year. But Christmas is a great opportunity to be with all family and to be united.

What's top of your Christmas list this year?

For me the most important thing is to be healthy. To be happy, to have the love of family, love of friends. And after, in terms of professional aspects, to be successful.

Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad?

Everyone is very excited about Christmas and generous and giving to others. So I don't think we have anyone like that in our team.

What's your favourite Christmas song?

'Jingle Bells'. Definitely my favourite.

Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing?

We don't drink, with playing every 3 days, its not a good thing to do. So we leave the alcohol on the side to make sure we are focused on the games.

WOJCIECH SZCZESNY

Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus?

I'd love to see Per Mertesacker dress up as him. But when he retires I think Santi Cazorla will look just like Father Christmas as he has a thing when he goes on holiday he can look just like him and put on some weight!

What's your favorite thing about Christmas?

Just the family getting together and spending time with my cousins.

What's top of your Christmas list this year?

I'm not too much into presents. I'm looking forward to spending time with family. It's the only time when my whole family comes to London. That's top of my wish list.

Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad?

Podolski. He moans all the time and he doesn't even enjoy Christmas!

What's your favourite Christmas song?

'Rocking around the Christmas tree'. I love that. In my first year at the club I had to sing for the first team!

Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing?

We have to stick to the diet. I do love Christmas food. I try to enjoy it without being silly. But we have to look after ourselves.

BT Sport is getting into the festive spirit with a new Christmas football marketing campaign that sees the BT Sport Christmas choir perform a variety of unexpected and light-hearted carols. Manchester City v Crystal Palace is live on BT Sport 1 from midday Saturday as one of six exclusively live games over the festive period including Boxing Day and New Year's Day double-headers.
