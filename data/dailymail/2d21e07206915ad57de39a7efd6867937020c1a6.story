The Adelaide parents of a four-year-old boy who was found just days from death after being locked in his filthy room and fed under the door have been jailed for at least six years.

Judge Paul Cuthbertson said what they did to their own flesh and blood was a 'disgrace', noting a doctor described the boy as looking like a concentration camp victim.

The 28-year-old father and 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty in the South Australian District Court to an aggravated charge of endangering the life of their son, who weighed just 8.3 kilograms when found by police.

The father and mother of a four-year-old boy have been sentenced to a maximum of eight years' prison for the severe neglect of their son 

They only happened to find the malnourished, dehydrated and shivering child when his mother called police to the Adelaide home complaining she had been assaulted by the boy's father.

The boy, who had been locked in his filthy room, was naked and crouched on the floor when he was found in October last year.

Judge Cuthbertson said most of the animal kingdom did a better job looking after their offspring than the couple did with their son.

The medical officer who examined the boy described him as having sunken eyes, brown and decayed teeth, and protruding ribs.

He gave 'the most distressing squeal I have ever heard in my life'.

'His hips were like someone from the Dachau concentration camp,' the officer said.

The judge set a maximum term of eight years.

Police had to wade through the rubbish and found the malnourished boy who weighed just 8.3 kilograms

Earlier this year, the court heard the mother of the boy was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son.

The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler.

'I've messed up, I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son," she said, Channel 9 reported.

'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with [her partner].' 

The court also heard during the pair's sentencing hearing in October, the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom.

He was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert, according to Channel 9. 

Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 per cent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 per cent. 

As for the young victim, who is now in foster care, the court heard he still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained.

Since being removed from his parents a year ago, the boy has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed and has limited language skills.

He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls.

A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, was read out during the October hearing.

The victim impact statement said normal family outings were obviously new to the boy, who would not come out of his room for the first six months after his removal. 

When he woke up, he would lie in his bed waiting for someone to come into his room. 

In an earlier police interview, the father said the boy was kept in his bedroom for 12 days and never complained about being fed under the door.

'We actually fed him pretty much every day, in that room, by sliding the plates under there, so far as we could hear, he was happy,' the boy's father said.
