Two British officers killed by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan were named last night by the Ministry of Defence.

Lieutenant Andrew Chesterman, 26, of the 3rd Battalion, The Rifles, was fatally wounded in Helmand province on Thursday.

A day later, Lance Corporal Matthew David Smith, 36, of the Corps of Royal Engineers, was also fatally wounded in the same Nad-e Ali district.

Lt Chesterman, originally from Guildford, Surrey, was commanding a vehicle patrol when the lead vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb. He was shot as he tried to help.

He leaves behind his father Paul and sisters Anna and Olivia.

Last night his father said: ‘We have lost a fine young man. It was readily apparent that Andrew gave himself fully and wholeheartedly to his career.’

L/Cpl Smith, from Aldershot, was shot while trying to build a checkpoint. The father-of-four was described as a devoted family man who talked endlessly about his fiancee Laura, his children Lainie, Ella, Tilli and Jai, and his parents Kenneth  and Caroline.

Last night Caroline led the tributes to her son. She said: ‘He was a loving father who will be dearly missed. Our Hero, R.I.P.’

The deaths bring the total number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 424.

Relaying news of the fatal attacks, Task Force Helmand spokesman Major 
Ian Lawrence said of the first death: 'It is with great sadness I must 
inform you that a soldier from 3rd Battalion The Rifles has died as a 
result of injuries sustained whilst on patrol in the Nad-e Ali district 
of Helmand Province.

'The thoughts and prayers of all in the Task Force are with his family and friends at this tragic time.'

He
said of the second death: 'It is my sad duty to inform you that a 
soldier from 30 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 26 Engineer Regiment, has 
been killed as a result of injuries sustained by enemy action whilst on 
duty in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand Province.

'The death of this brave Engineer will be
felt deeply by his family, friends and all those who served alongside 
him. We extend our deepest sympathy, thoughts and prayers to them at 
this difficult time.'

Earlier, the International Security 
Assistance Force (Isaf) said three US soldiers were killed in an 
incident in south-west Afghanistan by 'an individual wearing Afghan 
uniform'.

The deaths bring the number of British service personnel killed during the campaign to 424.
