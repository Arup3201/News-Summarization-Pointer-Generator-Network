It may look more like a high tech water pistol or something out of a sci-fi film than the latest weapon in the fight against crime.

But an innovative new tagging system using a gun and DNA pellets could make it easier for police to mark the cards of even the most volatile criminal.

Unlike a taser or gun that fires real bullets, the weapon won't hurt a suspect or render them incapacitated so that officers can pounce.

Latest gadget: UK-based company Selectamark has unveiled a new weapon in the fight against crime - a gun that fires DNA pellets to mark suspects for identification at a later date during volatile police situations

Instead, it will enable police to stay 
at a safe distance during trouble and identify criminals and arrest 
criminals days or even weeks after an incident.

The High Velocity DNA Tagging System, designed for use by police forces and the military by Kent-based firm Selectamark, fires small soft green pellets containing the transparent material at a target from as far away as 40 metres.

Each pellet, which weighs less than a gram and is effectively like a paintball, contains a unique DNA code which could remain on the target for weeks.

Andrew Knights from Selectamark said: 'On contact with the target the uniquely-coded SelectaDNA solution leaves a synthetic DNA trace mark that will enable the relevant authorities to confirm or eliminate that person from their involvement in a particular situation and could ultimately lead to arrest and prosecution.'

The material is small enough to penetrate through clothing and mark a suspect's skin as well as their clothing, the firm said.

The gun comes in both pistol and shotgun form, with the power to fire 20 shots in one session.

It will prove useful for officers when policing riots or when facing crowd control problems, say the brains behind the futuristic invention.

It could also be used when an officer is giving chase to an offender and is unable to keep up.

The DNA tag can be identified later on using a UV light and is designed to ensure that officers are arresting the right person.

The company unveiled the new product in Nevada, in the U.S last week, and said the response had been incredible.

'It's been 12 months in development, even though it only launched a few days ago, there has been a huge amount of interest,' said Jason Brown of Selectamark.

'We are in talks with several UK police forces, and other around the world.

'this is one of many toolsÂ  in the police arsenal for a riot situation, and we believe its a deterrent, because it's orange, people would know they can be tagged and would disperse.'

The gun also has a laser sight, and video and audio recording capabilities to collect evidence.

'Each officer has a batch of DNA signed out to them, and when combined with the video and audio we think this provides a substantial amount of evidence.'

The firm has even trained a sniffer to recognise the material, allowing police to detain crowds and easily find those who have been tagged.

The gun is an extension of an existing property marking system offered by the company which is used by businesses and homeowners across the world.

Last year, police in Nelson, Lancashire, saw a 100 per cent reduction in burglary when they offered SelectDNA marking to 600 local residents.

It was also revealed earlier this month that fast food giant McDonald's teamed up with the firm to install a spray in more than 700 stores which covers thieves in DNA linking them to a specific crime for several months.

The chain took the drastic action following a spate of robberies in its Australian outlets over Christmas and New Year.

Individual signature: Each round of  pellets contains a unique strand of DNA

Selectamark says that its products, including the new gun, uniquely mark valuable products in the home or criminals themselves with a synthetic DNA.

Each round of pellets in the High Velocity DNA Tagging system features a unique DNA code, meaning that an individual criminal who is shot by one of the pellets, can be traced back to the scene using a specific forensic signature.

Following an incident, details of codes are recorded on a police and insurance approved database so that when DNA is found on a suspect it can be matched against an incident.

The company say that the DNA in the pellets is completely synthetic so the number of unique codes is infinite.

The system cannot be hacked as prior knowledge of special 'key codes' is needed to identify the DNA strands.

This means that the type of code read by police cannot be copied or made up by third parties.

The pellet does not hurt criminals nor is it toxic and the DNA contains a UV tracer so that the mark left on a suspect can be found if they stand under a special lamp.
