Ed Miliband's plan to cut university tuition fees is facing internal opposition with predictions it could cause a civil war within the party

Ed Miliband's plan to cut university tuition fees was yesterday facing mounting opposition - with even a former Labour No10 aide joining the attack.

There were predictions last night that the party could descend into civil war over the controversial proposals after ex-Tony Blair aide Huw Evans was joined by the leader of Britain's nurses in challenging the plans.

Mr Miliband has said his pledge to slash the fees from £9,000 a year to £6,000 is 'cast-iron', adding the plan will be a 'red line' in any possible future coalition talks.

But the plan – to be paid for by cutting middle-class pension pots – has been condemned as 'financial illiteracy' by some critics, while university chiefs warn it could jeopardise the scrutiny of their long-term funding.

The policy has also led to more than four years of rows within the Shadow Cabinet, with claims that Ed Balls repeatedly warned Mr Miliband that the £2.9billion fees cut was difficult to fund.

Mr Evans, speaking in his capacity as director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), joined a growing number of pensions experts to challenge Labour's plans.

Mr Evans, who worked for Mr Blair from 2005 to 2006 and is also a former adviser to ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett, said: 'The pensions and long-term savings industry supports reform of tax relief but this is not the way to do it.

'We need a focus on reforming the pension tax relief system as a whole to make it fairer, better value and encourage saving from middle earners, rather than piecemeal cutting back the existing system to pay for other policy objectives.'

Under the Labour plan, tax relief for pensioners with incomes more than £150,000 would be cut from 45p to 20p while the tax-free lifetime allowance on a pension would drop from £1.25million to £1million.

But the proposals could also hit people due to retire with a pension pot worth just £26,000 a year from an annuity while young people saving just £400 a month may also be affected.

The plans have led to fears nurses, teachers and firefighters could also be hit.

Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Helping students financially is important. However, this must not be at the expense of hard-working nurses. We will examine these proposals to ensure their pensions will not be affected.'

Last night the comments were seized on by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He wrote to his Labour opposite number, Andy Burnham, saying: 'I wanted to ensure you are fully aware of the impact of this announcement on NHS staff. For example, if a nurse team leader earning around £35,500, who is in a final salary, defined benefit pension scheme, achieves the promotion to matron they have been working 25 years to achieve, they will face a tax charge of £5,000 on their pension pot. This is what happens when policies are not properly thought through.'

But Mr Miliband has claimed the pensions raid would hit only the very wealthy.

He said: 'The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country.'
