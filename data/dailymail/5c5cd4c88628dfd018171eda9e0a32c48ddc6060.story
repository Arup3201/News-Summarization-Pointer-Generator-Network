A budget hotel that hiked its prices so much during the period of the Commonwealth Games that its rooms were more expensive than those at The Ritz has now slashed them drastically.

The Glasgow Central Budget Apartments, which normally cost as little as £40, were earlier this year being advertised for an astonishing £1,500 a night during the sporting event, which opens on Wednesday.

The price became the most notorious example of profiteering by some accommodation suppliers during Glasgow 2014.

But now the apartments are being 
advertised for between £350 and £500 a night during the period of the 
games - after which they drop as low as £90.

Cheaper option: The Ritz London at the same time cost £285 less, although the Glasgow hotel has now slashed rates to as low as £350 a night

Pre-makeover: A hotel spokesman said rooms were being refurbished one at a time, and those done up were worth every cent

As accommodation providers in and around the host city are accused of 'blatant profiteering', it seems one hospitality firm in particular found literally 'going for gold' during the games harder than it thought.

And even though unremarkable accommodation has attracted some previous damning online criticism from former residents, the former price tag exceeded that attached to even a deluxe suite at Britain's most famous hotel.

A one-bedroom apartment on Glasgow's Bath Street has an open plan kitchen, dining and living area with a table and chairs, sofa, desk and flat-screen television.

In comparison, for £285 less - at a mere £1,215 - visitors to The Ritz London in February, when the Glasgow apartments huge prices were advertised, could have secured a deluxe suite with king or twin beds that includes a sitting room with views along Piccadilly, private and guest bathrooms and complementary chocolates, fruit and a bottle of Champagne on arrival.

The 860sq ft (80sq m) of glamour-filled luxury is decorated in a regal style to help visitors experience the grandiose and splendour of drawing room entertaining.

At the time a spokesman for Glasgow Central Budget Apartments said their rooms were 'unbelievable' and worth every penny.

'We're refurbishing them one at a time, the ones that are refurbished are a different class with built-in TVs to the bathrooms, we've spent hundreds of thousands on them,' he said then.

The £1500-a-night rate was also being advertised through the peak summer months of July, August and September.

Only last week the cost of a hotel room in Glasgow was said to have rocketed as the city plays host to the Commonwealth Games.

A new report which was published shows rooms have increased by a massive 158 per cent.

This means that a night in a hotel will now cost an average of £344 for the games period according to the Trivago Hotel Price Index (THPI) for July.

This is compared to an average of £133 for the week previous, and is a significant increase on this time last year, when a hotel room in Glasgow cost an average of just £78.

The most expensive night - Sunday 27 July will cost an average of £448, the study found, with Trivago suggesting this spike was due to the planned opening of the newly refurbished Hampden Park stadium on this date.

The stadium, which has received a £14m overhaul, will host athletics events including the men's 5,000 metres, in which Mo Farah is rumoured to be competing.

May saw the largest increase in interest in the city's hotels - a rise of 104 per cent and in June, searches increased by a further 13per cent.
