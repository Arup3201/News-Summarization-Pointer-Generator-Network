Tis the season to be jolly, but keep it away from the escalator or you may just end up like this hapless bunch. 

Network rail has released CCTV footage of unlucky passengers taking slapstick-style tumbles down escalators in a bid to keep Christmas revellers safe this festive season.

The footage taken at the newly refurbished Birmingham New Street shows passengers, falling down the silver stairs in a surprising amount of different ways.

Taking a tumble: Network Rail has released footage of passengers falling down escalators in a Christmas safety crackdown

The people most at risk are those carrying large amounts of Christmas shopping and those who may have over-indulged on the mulled wine.

Whether passengers are in a rush, 
carrying heavy luggage or wearing heals, the video entitled 'Escalator 
Escapades' aims to make aware to rail travellers the dangers of 
escalator.

The number of people hurt on escalator is down by more than 20 per cent compared with the previous year  - however the same causes of incidents remain.

Risk: A shopper heavily laden with bags sets off up an escalator at Birmingham New Street station

Fall guy: The unlucky passenger takes a tumble ending up flat on his back at the foot of the escalator

The unlucky passenger is carried up the stairs until a member of staff rushes to his aid and pushes the emergency stop

Latest figures show that more than 400 
people took a tumble on an escalator at the 17 biggest and busiest 
stations managed by Network Rail, including Birmingham New Street, 
London Paddington, Leeds and Edinburgh Waverley.

Ian Prosser, Director of Railway Safety at the Office of Rail Regulation said: 'We welcome Network Rail's latest campaign to raise awareness of safety risks from slips, trips and falls on escalator within Britain's railway stations.

'This is a timely reminder that a seasonal mix of alcohol, presents, luggage and in some cases high heels can leave rail users more prone to injuries, especially over the festive period.'

Trip: A young woman stumbles at the top of an escalator and falls flat on her face

Recovery: A man helps her up to the top, saving anymore embarrassment for the passenger

Safer option? A woman steadily grabs onto the hand rail as she makes her way up from the platform

Should have taken the stairs: She loses her footing and begins to tumble down the escalator

Clinging on: With no one around to help, she manages to pull herself up and carry on her journey
