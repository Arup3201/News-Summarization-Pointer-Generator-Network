Murdered: Jessica Ridgeway's dismembered body was found five days after she vanished

The family of murdered 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway has demanded a missing children's foundation that was set up after her disappearance stop using her picture and name for its fundraising efforts.

The Colorado Missing Children's Foundation has agreed to stop using pictures of the girl, who was found raped and dismembered in a park last month, after the family threatened legal action.

It was set up after she vanished while walking to school on October 5 and reportedly raised thousands of dollars for the family. A board member claimed the family now wants to set up their own foundation.

In a cease and desist letter, the Ridgeways claimed that Jessica's name was being used by the foundation on its website and Facebook pages to advertise fundraising events.

'The family has tried to address this 
issue with you informally by repeatedly asking you to stop using 
Jessica's name as a fundraising tool for your organization,' the letter 
read, KDVR reported.

'You have not respected the family's wishes and are continuing to 
make money off Jessica’s name.'

The letter added: 'We had hoped that it did not have to come 
to this however the foundation left us with no choice.'

Anger: Her family threatened a missing children's foundation set up after her disappearance with legal action unless they removed all of her pictures from its website

Charity: The foundation was set up by 10 friends and reportedly gave thousands of dollars to the family

The foundation was set up by a group of 
10 friends who raised money for the family after Jessica's 
disappearance, and now seeks to help find other missing children in the 
state.

It has previously used numerous photos of the young victim and carried fliers for an event, Light Up the Night, which was held the week she vanished while walking to meet friends.

They had also used her image and name for an event for this Saturday, Purple Ribbon Tattoo Event.

The foundation reportedly raised around $6,000 and gave the Ridgeway family more than $2,800.

Support: The foundation rallied search and memorial efforts, but has now removed Jessica's name from its site

Melissa Harding, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said the family raised the issue only after the money stopped coming in.

Ben Bargas, from the group's board, added that the family want to form their own foundation.

'We have given all funds raised for the 
Ridgeway family to them,' its website read. 'We are no longer raising money for the Ridgeway family as
they have asked us not to. All further monies raised will go directly 
to our foundation.'

But Jessica's sister, Rebecca Ridgeway, told KDVR: 'Tell the public this is not about the money. This is about the fact Jessica’s name and image is not theirs to use.'

Investigation: The murder in Westminster, Colorado captured the attention of the nation as the five-day hunt reached its tragic conclusion. Pictured, police search Rigg's home after the killing

The 10-year-old vanished on her way to meet friends to walk to school on October 5. Her dismembered body was found on October 10 at a park 10 miles from her home in Westminster.

Austin Reed Sigg, 17, has been accused of snatching, raping and murdering the girl, and made his first court appearance last week. Police say the DNA evidence against him is 'overwhelming'.

He was charged as an adult in 11 counts related to the ten-year-old's death and a further six related to an attempted kidnapping of a 22-year-old woman in Ketner Lake on May 28.
