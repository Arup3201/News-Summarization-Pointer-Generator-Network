Most of us stick to warm winter coats, hats and gloves for our Bonfire Night attire.

So when police arrived at Lewes bonfire night wearing protective goggles, many thought it was rather an extreme precaution.

However, all visitors to this year’s event in Sussex – the UK’s largest and most famous bonfire night – were urged by police to wear such safety goggles to avoid receiving any serious eye injuries.

Sussex Police said that wearing goggles to firework displays is ‘a standard procedure if attending firework displays.’

Prepared: Police wear eye protection at the annual bonfire revelry in the Sussex town

Dazzling spectacle: Crowds cluster round as dozens of performers with burning torches perform a ceremony - without wearing goggles

All ages: Young participants in the festivities, which also link to the infamous Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot against the Houses of Parliament in 1605

March of the flaming crosses: Lewes residents lined the streets in their hundreds to watch the procession of 17 flaming crosses to represent the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town in the 16th century

Spectacular show: Participants in the parade hold flaming torches to light up the chilly night air. Forecasters said tonight will be the coldest November 5 for over a decade

Religious connection: The flame procession in Lewes has its roots in the 16th century. In previous years, 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches

Step back in time: The shops and buildings on the main streets of Lewes may have changed, but this is one annual tradition that holds strong

Showpiece: Crowds and marchers gathered around the Lewes war memorial to light crosses. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up Parliament, is also burnt

Last year, 170 people were injured and two visitors received eye injuries that left them permanently blinded.

Around 20,000 people travelled by train to Lewes last night – with many more attending from the town itself.

Torch-lit parades of people in a variety of outfits, many in period costume, walked through streets packed full with the crowds.

A large effigy of Secretary of State for Education, Tory MP Michael Gove, was one of those that were burned.

Several people were arrested for illegal possession of fireworks or other offensive weapons.

The fiery procession traces its roots to the 16th-century reign of Mary I and the Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot of 1605.

It
is just one of many November 5 gatherings up and down the country, 
which illuminated the night sky with colourful pyrotechnics last night.

While some struck lucky with the weather, others were not so fortunate as their fireworks displays are spoilt by torrential rain. Temperatures plummeted  to below freezing in many areas.

Smoky: This marcher seemed to be creating his own trail of thick red smoke as he made his way through the streets of Lewes

Burn him! The effigy of Guy Fawkes is carried through the streets to be set alight

Spooky: Halloween may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade

The procession, organised annually by six local societies, marks a tumultuous time in English history.

A
key part of the parade is 17 flaming crosses, one for each of the 
Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 
as part of the Marian Prosecutions.

The
purge was initiated by the Roman Catholic monarch Queen Mary, who 
reigned between 1553 and 1558, and passed strict anti-Protestant 
legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the Pope.

At least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung, drawn and quartered.

It is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000.

An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament with Gunpowder.

The Lewes event has previously courted controversy - in 2001, an effigy of Osama Bin Laden attracted national attention, as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan.

A fiery history: The seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in Lewes as part of the Marian persecutions against Protestants in the reign of Mary I

History lesson: The Lewes Bonfire Night celebrations mark, in part, the Marian Persecutions of 1555-1557, a purge of Protestant religious reformers during the reign of Roman Catholic monarch Mary I. Heresy against the Catholic faith was punishable by death, with some burnt at the stake, as in Lewes, and other hung, drawn and quartered

While the flames remained alight in Lewes, others in the country saw their Bonfire Night pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain.

A number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding, with Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire the worst affected.

It follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend, including one in Newham, East London and in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.

In all, the Environment Agency issued seven flood warnings in England and Wales yesterday morning, covering areas of the South-West, South-East, East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales.There were also 53 flood alerts in operation .

In Carmarthenshire, nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on Sunday evening.

The Mid and West Wales fire and rescue service used a boat as part of their operation at the Pendine Caravan Park.

Flaming! Two of the marchers taking part in the annual Bonfire Night celebrations in Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, this evening. Dressed in vivid, blood-red costumes and brandishing burning torches, they are participating in an event which can trace its origins to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and the burning of 17 martyrs at the stake in the town in the period 1555-1557
