A car bomb ripped through a Shia neighbourhood in Beirut today, killing at least four people as Syria’s civil war spilled over the border.

The attack came as fresh pictures emerged from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in the aftermath of an alleged airstrike by government forces.

At least another 30 people died earlier in the week in violence across the country, and it was the second bombing in the Lebanese neighborhood of Haret Hreik this month.

Flames could be seen pouring from a multi-storey building as firefighters tried desperately to extinguish the flames, and thousands lined the street as the dead and injured were stretchered from the scene.

The blast is the sixth in a string targeting areas considered strongholds of Hezbollah since the group announced it was sending fighters to support President Bashar al-Assad's troops in neighbouring Syria

The
 violence has targeted both Sunnis and Shiites, and further stoked 
sectarian tensions that are already running high on opposing sides of the Syrian 
conflict.

It was the second bombing in the neighborhood of Haret Hreik this month amid a series of attacks that have shaken Lebanon in a spillover of Syria's civil war into its smaller neighbor.

It comes as a military police photographer has smuggled out of Syria evidence of the torture and killing of 11,000 detainees, according to a report by three former war crimes prosecutors.

The shocking images show emaciated corpses with strangulation marks, cuts, bruising and signs of electrocution – evidence of extreme torture, claim investigators. Some victims had no eyes.

The 55,000 photos will ratchet up the pressure on President Bashar Al Assad who the US and its Western allies – including the UK – say has committed war crimes against his own people.

Assad denies the claims, insisting he is fighting terrorists.

The attack came as fresh pictures emerged from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo after an alleged airstrike by government forces.

Today's explosion on a crowded street left 35 people wounded as it shattered shop windows, set cars ablaze and left debris across the pavement according to the Lebanese Red Cross.

Footage broadcast by the Hezbollah-owned al-Manar television station showed medics hauling a man on a stretcher out of the area as flames engulfed a building.

A group known as the Nusra Front in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in retaliation for Hezbollah's military support of President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria.

The claim, which could not be independently verified, was posted on the group's Twitter account. Its name suggested ties to the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front in Syria, one of the most powerful rebel factions. 

Lebanon's state media said a suicide car bomber was behind the attack. A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the vehicle was stolen and packed with 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of explosives.

'There was a car beeping, and then it exploded,' an unnamed eyewitness told the Voice of Lebanon radio station. 'Then we saw people on the ground - like every time.'

Similar attacks have targeted Shiite areas in Lebanon in recent months, apparently the work of Syria-based Sunni rebels or militant Islamist groups fighting to topple Assad who have threatened to target Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for intervening on behalf of his government in the conflict. 

On Thursday, a car bomb struck the northeastern Shiite town of Hermel close to the Syrian border during rush hour, killing at least three people and wounding more than 20. And on January 2, a bombing in Haret Hreik just meters (yards) from where Tuesday's attack occurred killed five people.

Another attack in November targeted the Iranian Embassy and killed at least 23 people. Iran is the chief patron of Hezbollah and an ally of Syria. 

Lebanon's Sunni community has also been hit, most notably by a deadly double car bombing outside Sunni mosques in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli in August. A December car bombing in Beirut killed prominent Sunni politician Mohammed Chatah. 

The attacks raise the specter of a sharply divided Lebanon being dragged further into the Syrian conflict. 

Shortly after Tuesday's bombing, clashes broke out in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, killing at least one person, said the security official.

The city, with impoverished rival Sunni and Shiite areas, has seen frequent sectarian clashes linked to the war Syria that have killed dozens. 

The latest fighting unraveled a tenuous truce in effect earlier in the morning, following clashes that broke out between the rival neighborhoods on Saturday.
