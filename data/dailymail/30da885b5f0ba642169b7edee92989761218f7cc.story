New footage has emerged of the shocking explosion this week that killed eight people, injured dozens more and leveled two Manhattan buildings.

Surveillance video released by the New York Fire Department shows the harrowing moment the Harlem blast blew out windows, showered debris onto the street and almost seriously injured a passerby.

The footage, first made public by WCBS, also shows a plume of smoke descending on Park Avenue as the helpless pedestrian ducks for cover and falls to the sidewalk.

The deadly Wednesday blast believed to have been caused by a gas leak that residents claimed they had smelled for a long time, according to reports.

It claimed the lives of eight people and injured more than 60 people as debris showered down onto Park Avenue and the Metro-North commuter railroad tracks above.

The video from a camera near the buildings destroyed in the explosion shows the blast come completely out of nowhere as debris showers down onto the sidewalk.

‘I thought it was an earthquake,’ Ibrahim Occasion told the station. ‘It was an explosion, like, connected to your building, so it's insane stuff.’

People as far away Queens, across the Harlem River, heard the massive blast, local media reported.

Commuter trains into and out of Grand Central, the nation’s busiest train terminal, were suspended for the rest of Wednesday, stranding commuters from returning back to upstate New York and Connecticut.

Investigators hope the footage will provide insight that will help determine an exact cause of the explosion.
