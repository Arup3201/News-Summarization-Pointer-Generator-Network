Less than 12 hours before I’m due to have a C-section to bring my twin daughters into the world and I’m on the phone to my younger sister Abigail, begging her to come to my flat.

Sensing the urgency in my voice, she drives across South London to be with me.

Naturally I’m restless. Like any mother-to-be, I want my babies to arrive safely. But I’m also concerned that a vital piece of equipment, one that will smooth my ride into the first few days of motherhood, has broken. Luckily my sister has a spare.

A breast-pump, perhaps? Maybe a nappy-disposal system? Er no ... hair straighteners.

Less than 12 hours before she was due to have a C-section to give birth to her twin daughters, Jill (pictured) asked sister Annabel to borrow her hair straighteners

The fact that I was even thinking about my hair when my main focus should have been my babies came as no surprise to my family. For decades, they have listened to me moan about my mop of unruly curls.

It’s not only that it has more twists and turns than an Underground map, but it’s thicker than the entire cast of Made In Chelsea. If I was going to look anywhere near presentable in the post-partum snaps, it was going to need straightening.

Was I being ridiculously vain? Absolutely. But I also knew that by fighting the frizz, I’d feel more in control as I embarked on the overwhelming journey into motherhood.

It will come as no surprise that once Charlotte and Martha arrived, and were then whisked off to the special care unit because they were premature, I barely gave my hair a second thought.

And since that day I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve sported straight hair. As a result, I’m finally coming round to the curly mane that used to be the bane of my life. 

Like Jill, Nicole Kidman has tried to hide her curly hair by straightening it

Seems I’m not alone. Earlier this week, fellow frizzhead Nicole Kidman admitted that after years of loathing her curly hair, she is learning to love it. The Oscar-winning actress said that her three-year-old daughter Faith has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel.

‘I almost never straighten it any more; I let it go curly and wild,’ she said. ‘It’s taken me 40-something years, but I embrace the curl.’

The Oscar-winning actress said that her three-year-old daughter Faith has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel.

I can relate. I’m approaching 40 and it’s only since becoming a mum that I have appreciated my ringlets. It’s not simply a question of saving precious time — although drying my hair curly takes five minutes whereas having it straightened takes about 45 minutes, a myriad smoothing products and, often, a hairdresser.  

No, it’s because suddenly I’m happier in my hair. The smooth look that gave me such confidence when I worked in a stressful office environment no longer reflects my personality or circumstances.

Life with two marauding toddlers is about as smooth as a Channel ferry crossing. Curly, wild hair matches my circumstances. Yes, it’s slightly out-of-control, but it’s more relaxed, less bothered about what others think about it.

I inherited my bouncy hair from my father, Clive, whose dark head of curls has made him look like a cross between footballer Graeme Souness and comedian Bobby Ball.

My late grandmother — whose hair was wavy, but not the full frizz — blamed the fact that she ate walnuts throughout her pregnancy, which always made us laugh.

As a baby, I had a mop-top of curls, but oddly in my early childhood my hair straightened out to a glossy reddish brown.  Then, in the Eighties I had a bubble perm. As soon as I looked in the mirror I regretted it. Sure enough, at school I earned a range of nicknames from Crystal Tipps — the Seventies cartoon character with wild hair — to Aslan, the lion from C.S. Lewis’ Narnia Chronicles. Still, I felt sure it would grow out.

Jill's perm left her looking like Aslan form the Chronicles of Narnia

Except it didn’t. Although perms are known to damage the hair, some experts believe the texture can also change during puberty thanks to hormones making each strand of hair thicken.

What followed were years full of hair-angst. These were the days before serums banished frizz. I improvised with greasy concoctions of my own invention — one involving baby oil and Vaseline. If any boys had shown any interest — and they didn’t — they would have had to approach me in protective clothing.

At university, I had to leave it curly as I couldn’t afford expensive hair products. But I’d tie it back, up or even wear hats indoors.

Over the years the teasing continued, but I figured it was better to be talked about than ignored. It was during this time that hair straightening came into fashion. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Kylie all became purveyors of the poker-straight look.

When I could afford it, I would get my locks smoothed professionally. Suddenly, I noticed I was taken more seriously. 

Jill found she was taken more seriously when she straightened her hair

It got me thinking about wavy hair and success. Apart from interior designer Kelly Hoppen and the late Body Shop founder Anita Roddick, there are few women with curls in positions of power. Straight hair means straight-talking and I recall an interview with a female BBC reporter who said she straightened her hair as curly hair wasn’t acceptable on air. Apparently, newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky also religiously straightens her naturally frizzy hair.

Yet now, as I’m coming around to the idea of leaving my hair as nature intended, it seems I’m on trend. A survey of more than 2,000 women found that 74  per cent of those with wavy or curly hair say their look gets compliments.

My husband Robin says my hair was one of the first things that attracted him to me and doesn’t like it when I straighten it. My daughters also seem to prefer curly mummy to straight mummy. When they see pictures of me looking glossy and groomed, they look confused. When they see me with a wild mane, they smile and say: ‘Mummy!’ which melts my heart.

Likee Nicole Kidman, Jill will remain natural from now on for the sake of her daughters

Like Nicole Kidman, I will remain natural from now on for the sake of my daughters. Their baby-soft strands may be straight now but the curly gene is beginning to take hold at the edges. It looks impossibly gorgeous.

I want them to know that it’s OK to be different. Of course, it’s inevitable that they will go through phases of hating their hair and I know I won’t be able to keep them away from straighteners for ever. But for now, I’ll be steering clear. In a world so obsessed with fixing every flaw, I’d hate for my girls to think they must iron out every imperfection just like mummy irons out her hair.

Making a mane of corkscrews look ‘naturally beautiful’ can be an awful lot of hard work. Here are my top tips . . .

TAME THE TANGLES

Brushing curls results in a cloud of fluff, but brushing before you get in the shower gets rid of tangles and means shampoo and conditioner work more effectively.

Try John Frieda’s Curl Around Style Activating Conditioner (£5.59, boots.com) which you can even leave in overnight.

When it comes to the final rinse, curly-haired Nadia Dean, stylist at London’s John Frieda salon, recommends tipping your head upside down and rinsing from the nape of your neck to the tips.

‘This stops the hair going flat at the roots,’ she says.

USE A PRIMER

Because of their shape, curls never looks as shiny as straight hair. Sorry, laws of physics, flat surfaces reflect light better than curved ones. For a glossy look, try a primer. Living Proof Prime Style Extender (£18, spacenk.com) seals hair against water and the dreaded frizz, while Alterna Caviar Repair Protein Cream (£24.75, beautyflash.co.uk) renders even the coarsest hair sleek.

Nadia suggests combing primer through using a Tangle Teezer (£10.20, lookfantastic.com).

FIND A GREAT GADGET

If, like me, you’d rather not leave your curls to chance by letting them dry naturally, there are some excellent options. Curlformers (£10, thisisbeautymart.com) are the modern version of rolling your hair with rags but with spiral tubes.

Babyliss’ Curl Secret (£119, johnlewis.com) might be pricey, but can’t be beaten. You clamp the gadget on a section of dry hair, then it winds the hair into the heated chamber and, releases a perfect curl.

SLEEP IN A SCRUNCHIE

However you create curls, sparing use of a serum or oil is essential to give shine. My favourites include Charles Worthington Shine Booster All Over Gloss Spray (£5.99, boots.com) and L’Oreal Extraordinary Oil (£9.99, boots.com).

To preserve your curls overnight, tie up your hair as high and as loose as possible — an old school scrunchie is ideal.
