The Government is set to force manufacturers to add folic acid to white bread in a bid to cut the number of babies being born with spinal defects.

Health minister Earl Howe yesterday gave the clearest indication yet that action will be taken, following a survey into the country’s diet and nutrition.

Making folic acid - a B9 vitamin - a compulsory ingredient in bread could prevent at least 300 babies a year developing spina bifida and other birth defects, it is estimated.

Debate has raged for more than two decades over whether the Government should introduce compulsory fortification of flour, but there has been growing pressure from scientists and nutritionists to tackle the issue.

Experts have said flour fortification with folic acid would be one of the single most effective public health measures the UK could take.

Earl Howe said the Government would announce its decision in the ‘next few days’ but hinted that ministers would make fortification mandatory.

Shadow
 health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath told him at question time in 
the House of Lords ‘It is clear and the Government has already briefed 
out that it is going to agree to this.

‘We
 are going off on a very long Easter recess and joy would be unconfined 
if you told us now what the Government has agreed to. Why don’t you come
 clean on it?’

Lord Howe replied: ‘Because I have been told I can’t.’

Women wanting to start a family, and in early pregnancy, are advised to take folic acid supplements to prevent birth defects

Women wanting to start a family, and in early pregnancy, are advised to take folic acid supplements to prevent birth defects, but uptake is low.

Fewer than one in three women do so before becoming pregnant, according to research earlier this year, and there is a lack of the vitamin in their diets.

The Food Standards Agency has advised the Government that mandatory fortification would prevent most cases of disabilities such as spina bifida.

There have been concerns that such a policy might promote ‘mass medication’ of the population, and it could be harmful to some.

It may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency 
in the elderly, which can seriously damage the nervous system, and it 
may be linked to bowel cancer.

Lord
 Howe said the Government had been waiting for information on the 
‘folate status’ of the population from the national diet and nutrition 
survey, which would report how much B9 people absorb naturally.

He
 said the results of the survey had been ‘significantly delayed’ but the
 Government would press ahead and make a decision on the issue by 
Easter.

Labour’s Lord Rooker, a former minister and chairman of the Food Standards Agency and a leading supporter of compulsory fortification, urged the Government not to wait any longer.

He said ‘At the present time the congenital anomaly register shows that on average in England and Wales there are 13 pregnancies terminated every week due to neural tube defects and three live births with spina bifida and other conditions, two thirds of which tragedies could be avoided by fortification.’ He said the United States had fortified flour since 1998.

Lord Howe said ‘It is right that the 
Government balances both the risks and the benefits of a policy that 
would see the mandatory fortification of a staple food and I think that 
is a responsible course to take.’

He added: ‘It is worth us remembering that no other country in the European Union has taken the decision to fortify flour with folic acid.

‘We need to do this evaluating the risks and benefits using the most up-to-date data we can get.’ But Lord Patel, an independent crossbench peer and retired obstetrician, told him: ‘You said no other European country has adopted fortification.

‘Will you agree that none of the other European countries have the same incidence of neural tube defect as we in the United Kingdom have. It is far, far greater in the UK?’ Lord Howe said that was an issue that would be ‘weighed up.’ Charities including the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) have called on the Government to take swift action.
