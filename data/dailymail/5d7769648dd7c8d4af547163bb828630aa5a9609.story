Landon Donovan admitted his international send-off was ‘beyond his wildest dreams’after his 157th and final match for the USA.

The American star was given a testimonial to sign off his career after being left out of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad.

But the 32-year-old said he never expected to play for his country again after the snub, and paid credit to US Soccer president Sunil Gulati for making it happen.

'Three, four months ago, if someone asked if this day would happen, I would have said you're out of your mind and you're crazy,' Donovan said of the testimonial. 

'I give all the credit to Sunil for sticking with me through some hard conversations and understanding what was important and making it happen.

'I believe this is a day I deserve. I believe this is a day my family deserves for all the sacrifices they've made.'

'The thought of being in this environment again didn't seem all that appealing at the time,' Donovan said. 

'But at the end of the day I looked at the big picture and realized what a special day this could be. It's almost like, if you care to believe this stuff, in many ways it's meant to be. I think it's no coincidence it's 10-10 today.' 

America's all-time top goalscorer was keen to emphasise the impact of his World Cup rejection on his family, but admitted he had learned from the experience of being dropped.

'People forget, for those of us who weren't selected this summer to play in Brazil, it's not only difficult for us, it's difficult for our families,' he said. 

'In many instances, our families had this amazing vacation trip of a lifetime planned, and that was taken from them.'

'Although I didn't agree with the decision and I still know I should have been there, it was also good for me to say, you know what, it's not always going to go your way.

'And it took time for me to get to that place. I'm human. I had some very real emotions after. But after a while I said: Maybe this is a going to be a good thing. And I wouldn't have the opportunity to grow had it not happened.

'I certainly grew a lot more by that happening than if I had gone to the World Cup and played there, and in that way you can learn a lot from it.

'I had the opportunity to feel what other players have felt in my career. A lot of times when I made a team I was so happy for me that I forgot about the guy who got cut, so for the first time it kind of put that in front of my face.'
