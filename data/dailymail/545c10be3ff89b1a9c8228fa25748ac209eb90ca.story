A family is fighting a bitter war over the £4million fortune of a ‘selfish’ property and restaurant tycoon who was said to have used prostitutes and once threw a dog off a cliff in front of his weeping relatives

Piero Curati, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died aged 81 in 2007 - a year after his wife Emilia - and his sister Carmen Curati, 90, has been at war with his niece and nephew ever since over the money.

He was ‘a selfish, demanding, controlling man, who could explode with demonstrations of extreme cruelty’ as well as a ‘philanderer’ who used prostitutes, his niece Sylvana Perdoni told a court.

Previous win: If Piero Curati's 1980 will was valid on his death, then his nephew Roberto Perdoni (left) and niece Sylvano Perdoni (right) will inherit his wealth in England, valued at £1.8million after payment of inheritance tax

Central to the dispute are two wills he signed in 1980 and 1994 – the first in England and the other in Italy, his birth country. If the latter will replaced the earlier, Mrs Curati will inherit all his global assets.

However, if the 1980 will was valid on his death, then his niece and nephew, Sylvano and Roberto Perdoni, will inherit all his wealth in England, valued at £1.8million after payment of inheritance tax.

Sylvana, of Chiswick, west London, and Roberto, of Mill Hill, north-west London, last year won a High Court debate, but Mrs Curati - their aunt - now wants the Court of Appeal to reverse that decision.

This would effectively disinherit the Perdoni duo. Mrs Curati insisted that her brother never thought of himself as British, despite moving to this country to make his fortune in the 1950s.

She added that he continued to speak the native dialect of Carpaneto fluently and had intended his Italian will to revoke his English one.

Her barrister Robert Grierson argued he may have forgotten about his older English will and, had he remembered it, would have wanted it ‘obliterated’ with his niece and nephew’s inheritance rights.

During the trial of the case, Ms Perdoni told the court of his character: ‘It was well known by the family including (his wife) Emilia that Piero went with prostitutes and that he was a philanderer.

‘Throughout my life Piero always behaved like a big spoilt kid. If he didn’t get his way he would sulk terribly and his mood would darken so much it was almost unbearable.

‘I recall one evening he was sulking about something. He grabbed the small dog that used to come to the kitchen step of the family holiday villa in Italy for scraps.

‘I remember seeing him pick up the dog, throwing it into a black bin liner then throwing it into the boot of his car.

‘Then with full knowledge that my mother, aunt, Roberto and I were watching horrified from the balcony, he drove down the drive to the end of the twisting road and he threw the bag over the cliff edge. I remember my mother and my aunt crying because of what he had done.'

She continued: ‘Despite his deplorable and totally abhorrent behaviour, and his hateful character, Emilia and Piero loved each other and I believe one could not live without the other. Piero often spoke of his home being wherever my aunt was. My aunt always viewed England as her home.

Ms Perdoni

‘Piero always referred to England as his home and never spoke of wanting to live in Italy...I know from what he said that Piero considered himself British.’

Mr Justice Sales ruled last year that English, not Italian, law applied to the case because Mr Curati, despite his Italian roots, ‘regarded England as his home and considered himself to be British’.

‘I have reached the conclusion that the 1994 will did not wholly revoke the 1980 will,’ he concluded. 'The material part of the 1980 will, which leaves the English estate of the deceased to his niece and nephew, continues to be valid and must now be carried into effect.’

Lords Justice Pill, Munby and Tomlinson have now reserved their judgment at the Court of Appeal on Mrs Curati’s case against that ruling and will give their decision at a later date.
