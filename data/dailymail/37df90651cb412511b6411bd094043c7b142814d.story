Aaron Schaffhausen's aunt took the stand on Monday and told the court that the killer was 'unplanned by his mom and unwanted by his dad'.

Patricia Fix appeared at the trial along with Schaffhausen's mother, father and prison psychiatrist. Ms Fix also said that the family had a history of depression. 

Schaffhausen has admitted to killing 
his three daughters - 11-year-old Amara, eight-year-old Sophie and 
Cecilia, five, on July 10 last year, but claims he was not responsible 
due to mental illness.

Jurors will determine whether he was sane at the time of the slayings at the family's home in River Falls, Wisconsin.

His father also testified during the second week of trial that Aaron was a difficult baby who did not like to be touched.

Roger Schaffhausen testified that his son Aaron was a rebellious and belligerent teen who had some 'run-ins with the law'. The elder Schaffhausen says his son stole a gun, brought it to high school and was expelled.

However he admitted that his son became a better person after marrying his wife Jessica and that he liked being a father to his three daughters.

Roger Schaffhausen said that when his son's marriage broke down and his estranged wife began seeing someone else then he began to behave strangely and made deeply alarming remarks.

According to Fox, Mr Schaffhausen senior said: 'There was one phone call received around 
two o'clock in the morning. He was very despondent, depressed.

Horror: Amara Schaffhausen, 11, Sophie Schaffhausen, 8, and Cecilia Schaffhausen, 5, were found dead in their home after their father cut their throats

'Sounded 
like he was always weeping. That he wanted to do terrible things to 
Jess' boyfriend. He wanted to hurt the girls to show how much pain he 
was in.'

The murder suspect's mother Sue Allen told jurors that her son became extremely depressed when he and his wife Jessica broke up. She said that mental illness was common in other relatives.

Ms Fix said that she had been deeply concerned that Schaffhausen was going to harm his daughters when he made phone calls to her.

Dr Ralph Baker, a prison psychiatrist, also took the stand. He explained that while Shaffhausen was depressed, he did not appear to have a mental condition that would legally support an insanity defense. 

Baker says Schaffhausen told him what happened at the house was a 'spur of the moment thing'.

Schaffhausen told Baker he tried to help Cecilia find her shoes, and the next thing he knew, he had his hands on her neck and was strangling her before then slitting his three daughters' throats.
