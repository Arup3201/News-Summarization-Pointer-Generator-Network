Mayoral makeover: Newly-elected Australian mayor Darryn Lyons shows off his ceremonial robes

He is known for his surgically-enhanced six-pack, bright pink Mohawk and unconventional dress sense.

But yesterday ex-celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons switched his extravagant attire for a dapper pin-striped suit and mayoral robes as he began his career as an Australian mayor.

The 48-year-old won the mayoral race in his hometown of Geelong yesterday with a comfortable win, taking 29.79 percent of the primary vote.

He looked teary-eyed as 
he spoke to the media, shortly after he was named the city's new mayor, 
saying: 'I love Geelong'.

Just 24 hours later, the former paparazzo's smile was back on his face as he donned his ceremonial robes and eye-catching regalia in front of waiting photographers.

He wore his mayoral medallion, fur-trimmed gown and a black-and-white tie in front of his new office, city hall.

The former Celebrity Big Brother contestant also chose to keep his trademark Mohawk for the photos, but opted against the bright pink he dyed it during his appearance on the reality TV show.

He also showed off a dapper pin-striped suit during the shoot, and then posted the photos on Twitter.

Alongside the photos, he said: 'Long day a great working day sharing a fleeting moment from city hall today still working.'

When
 he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria 
he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every 
election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age.

His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion
 and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, 
and a stream of public appearances. 

Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22. 

In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency 
Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David 
Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World.

In 2011 he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces.

He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time.

The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.'

On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack.

The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked 
out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has
 super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym.

Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body.

'I
 had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all 
the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there.

'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.'

Big Pictures went into administration last year with a string of debts, leaving 21 of his London-based staff without jobs.

But
 back in Australia Mr Lyons set up Mr Paparazzi Celebrity Deals and 
established himself as a shareholder of another firm called BPGG Limited
 – which promptly bought up the assets of Big Pictures from the 
administrators for £164,000.

He
 appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 and has also 
appeared on a series of television shows - including the Australian 
version of Dragons’ Den and an ITV reality series about the magazine 
business called Deadline.
