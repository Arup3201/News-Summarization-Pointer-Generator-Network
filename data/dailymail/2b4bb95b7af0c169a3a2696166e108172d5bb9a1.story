The manned version of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is ready to undergo a series of crucial safety tests in a bid to return America to manned spaceflight.

Nasa hopes the capsule, dubbed Dragon V2, will be ready to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station by 2017.

SpaceX recently posted two photos of the test vehicle on Twitter, writing: 'America's next-gen crewed spacecraft is almost ready for a test flight. Pad abort vehicle shipping to Florida shortly.'

The 'pad abort' trial, which will take place in the next few weeks, will reveal how the Soyuz-replacement will behave if there is a problem during launch.

Former astronaut Garrett Reisman explained that during the test, Dragon will sit on a truss structure instead of a Falcon 9 rocket.

'We're going to have a crash-test dummy inside and a prototype seat, so we'll get data from that,' Reisman said.

'We're going to have a very flight-like propulsion system as far as everything that goes into the abort, including the avionics, which are going to be identical to the avionics we plan for the flight vehicle.'

SpaceX recently posted two photos of the test vehicle on Twitter, writing: 'America's next-gen crewed spacecraft is almost ready for a test flight. Pad abort vehicle shipping to Florida shortly.

Eight SuperDraco rocket engines will push the spacecraft away from the truss platform, launching it several thousand feet into the air. 

Three parachutes will then unfurl and the Dragon will, hopefully, land the Atlantic Ocean just offshore Cape Canaveral. 

If all goes to plan, the second test will see SpaceX' Dragon 2 take to the sky on a Falcon 9 rocket.

In September, Nasa revealed that Boeing and SpaceX will both build America's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

Boeing will be the first commercial company to carry a Nasa astronaut to space in July 2017 under a contract with the US space agency, followed by its competitor SpaceX, officials said last month.

Nasa is funneling billions of dollars to both companies so that they can replace American access to the orbiting International Space Station after the US space shuttle program was retired in 2011.

The announcement of $4.2 billion for Boeing and $2.6 billion for SpaceX was made in September 2014.

However, a legal challenge by Sierra Nevada -- which was developing a space-shuttle-like vehicle called Dream Chaser and was closed out of the competition -- meant that officials could not reveal many details until now. 

Commercial Crew Program Manager Kathy Lueders said at a press conference in Houston, Texas that Boeing would be the first to make two contracted missions to carry Nasa astronauts, since it has completed two milestones so far, and SpaceX just one.

The long-awaited $6.8bn deal to replace the Space Shuttle and end reliance on Russia's Soyuz craft was revealed at the Kennedy Space Center, where launches will take place from 2017.

Under the deal, Boeing will be given $4.2 billion and SpaceX $2.6 billion. Nasa hopes it will spur private development in space.

'Ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that's the vision of a commercial space industry,' said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden.

The contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one Nasa astronaut aboard to verify the rocket and spacecraft system can launch and dock to the space station.

Once each company's test program has been completed successfully, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.

SpaceX and Boeing said last month that they are on track to carry out their first manned test flights to the space station in 2017.

U.S. manned launches ended with the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011.

Until SpaceX and Boeing begin flying crews from Cape Canaveral, Nasa astronauts must continue to hitch rocket rides with Russia.

Nasa's commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the average price for a seat aboard the SpaceX Dragon and Boeing CST-100 capsules will be $58 million.

That compares with $71 million a seat charged by Russia under its latest Nasa contract.

'I don't ever want to have to write another check' to the Russian Space Agency after 2017, said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden, a former shuttle commander.

'If we can make that date,' he said, referring to 2017, 'I'm a happy camper.'

Unlike the Russian charge, the $58 million per-person cost estimate includes a fair amount of cargo to be flown aboard the SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft, along with four crew members.

The Russian Soyuz holds a maximum of three people, with at least one a Russian to pilot the craft.

SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the future enhanced Dragon capsule could carry five astronauts — one more than Nasa's stipulated four - and still meet all the cargo requirements.

The Hawthorne, California, company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, was the space station's first commercial shipper. It's been successfully delivering supplies since 2012 with the Dragon.

Boeing's CST will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations from 2017, it was revealed

Boeing's vice president and general manager for Houston-based space exploration, John Elbon, said an unmanned test flight of the CST-100 capsule in 2017 will be followed a few months later by the first crewed test flight.

That first manned mission will include one Boeing test pilot and one NASA astronaut, he said.

SpaceX said an unmanned test flight could occur as early as 2016, followed by a crewed flight in 2017.

Bolden has previous said Nasa wouldn't be able to do deep-space exploration if it was still saddled with getting supplies and people to low-Earth orbit.

'We're about going to Mars,' he said.
