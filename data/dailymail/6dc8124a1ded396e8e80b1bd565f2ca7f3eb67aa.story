A Shania Twain superfan has sacrificed relationships, thousands of pounds, hundreds of hours and even her first name in a bid to emulate her ‘inspirational’ idol.

Saskia Vese, 32, has spent around £5,000 on the Canadian singing star’s music and merchandise since she became a fan in 1998.

She said: 'When I saw the video for ‘That Don’t Impress Me Much’, I was amazed. People were obsessed with the fact she dared to show her midriff, which was very unusual for a country and western star at the time.

'I admired the fact she went against convention and was determined to be herself. It was something I wanted to emulate.

'I saw a Shania Twain tribute at a local bar and realised I could do a better job.'

Miss Vese, of Matlock, Derbyshire, began building a collection of outfits to mirror the star - including the famous leopard-print trench coat - and began performing in local pubs as a tribute act.

She said: 'I wanted my act to be perfect - a singing teacher taught me how to fix my singing voice to sound just like her.

'Over the years I must have spent £3,000 on clothes for my act, and at least £1,500 on merchandise. I’ve got all her CDs and DVDs, and even things like mugs and table mats.'

Miss Vese, who took her act to venues in Spain and Blackpool, began to embody Shania Twain in everyday life.

She said: 'When I meet people I didn’t know, I introduce myself as Shania. I've even begged my mum to call me Shania too. She just laughs at me and refuses though.'

'I really identify with her, and the tribute act fed into my creative side. It’s something not many people easily understand.'

Miss Vese, who runs an online fashion store, says her Shania Twain obsession has taken a toll on her relationships.

She said: 'With every boyfriend I’ve had, there came a point where there were three people in the relationship. I suppose men want to feel as if they’re at the centre of my attention, but I’ve never been able to give them that because I’m too creative and driven.

'I don’t want to compromise being myself.'

She met her most recent boyfriend, Brad Schooner, 39, at a gig in 2011 but the relationship ended after a just few months.

Mr Schooner said: 'I found her house full of stuff to do with Shania - mugs, plates, DVDs, towels and leopard print stage outfits.

'It made sense because she was a tribute act but soon I realised that she would constantly watch her DVDs and listen to Shania’s music over and over again.

'I thought it was just a phase, but she didn’t grow out of it and eventually I gave up on the relationship.

'It was a real shame, Saskia is such a beautiful women inside and out, but the Shania obsession was so constant it freaked me out.

'When Saskia sang ‘From This Moment’ she always had me in tears. It still moves me just thinking about it because she’s very talented girl.

'I miss Saskia, but I don’t miss Shania.'

Miss Vese said: 'Being creative is my life’s vocation and sadly that means I’ve had to make sacrifices. But I can’t stop being me.'

Miss Vese now plans to visit Las Vegas, where Shania Twain has a residency singing at Caesars Palace.
