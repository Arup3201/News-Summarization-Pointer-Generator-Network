Bovey Castle was built in 1907 on the banks of the river Bovey for the second Viscount Hambleden, William Frederick Danvers Smith, but is now a luxury hotel and golf course.

Shoes Only Travel chose the posh period drama-style setting because it is 'steeped in romantic literature... a place of striking beauty and romance'.

The US firm's website boats: 'We have arranged a private takeover of one of England's most spectacular and luxurious Castle Estates. Think a sexy and erotic Downton Abbey.

'Situated on 275 plush English green acres, our castle offers a dazzling array of pampering pleasures and exciting activities.

'We dare say that few have experienced the English Countryside in as romantic and sensuous a fashion that our 'Pleasure Castle' adventure in July 2015 will offer.

'Not only will all of the wonderful delights of the Castle be available to you but each day and evening will be filled with sensuous, fun and titillating events by day and night.'

The five-day night party, which starts on July 5, includes a 'sexy Renaissance fair on the lawn' and an 'erotic Au Natural closest to the pin challenge'.

Guests can also enjoy tennis, hunting, fishing, an historic tour of nearby Exeter - as well as 'multiple playhouses including one with a dungeon and mistress'.

Bovey Castle has hosted regular guests since 1930, when it was turned into a hotel by the Great Western Railway, before being sold to the British Transport Commission in 1948.

In the 1990s entrepreneur Peter de Savary refurbished the 64-bed retreat and renamed it 'Bovey Castle'. 

Since then it has been sold to a hotel group, and is run by the Eden Hotel Collection. 

The decision to hire out the venue to swingers has not gone down to all of the hotels leisure group members, who pay up to £725 a year for access to the castle's spa.

One, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I hope this isn't a new direction for the hotel owners. I for one will be concerned about getting in the pool again afterwards.'

Shoesonlytravel.com, which prides itself on delivering 'classy nude and swinger vacations', defended the party as a private event for 'serious' travellers. 

A spokesman said: 'Our criteria in selecting venues is to find beautiful 5-star properties around the world which offer our members, who are all serious travellers, the opportunity to explore and visit wonderful and interesting places in a private setting.'

A spokesman for the Eden Hotel Collection said: 'The Eden Hotel Collection confirms that a booking has been made by a North American tour company for exclusive use of Bovey Castle next summer. 

'As with any reservation contract we enter into with a guest, we are unable to discuss confidential details of their booking.'
