Steven Gerrard may be tasked with leading England to World Cup glory this summer, but the skipper managed to take time out to focus on domestic matters.

Gerrard opened up an Instragram account and his first post was of him posing with Liverpool and England team-mates Rickie Lambert and Daniel Sturridge.

The 34-year-old took the opportunity to welcome Lambert to Anfield following his £4million move from Southampton as well as wishing the Merseyside outfit a happy 122nd birthday.

Gerrard wrote: 'Hello to everyone from Miami, my first official Instagram post. Nice to share it with fellow Reds @dstudge and Rickie Lambert, I'm delighted he'll be with us next season. Also happy 122nd birthday to LFC!'

The Three Lions are based in the United States as they prepare for two warm up games against Ecuador and Honduras before travelling to Brazil.

England begin the World Cup with their opening game against Italy on June 14, followed by clashes with Uruguay and Costa Rica.
