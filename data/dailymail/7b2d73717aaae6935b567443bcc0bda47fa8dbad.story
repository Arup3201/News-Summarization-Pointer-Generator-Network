The passengers aboard a sailboat that sank Thursday night in a storm about 900 miles of the coast of Bermuda are lucky to be alive, according to the ship's captain.

'We were preparing to die,' sailboat owner Leonard Rorke, 55, of the United Kingdom, told the Coast Guard in a recording posted to the agency's website.

He, wife Lisa Rorke, 50, and 29-year-old Henri Worthalter, of Belgium, and a dog named Dexter were instead saved by the crew of a passing freighter.

The 49-foot-sailboat Blue Pearl sank Thursday evening after being badly battered from two days of storms, Leonard Rorke told the Coast Guard.

'We were bailing water. It was life and 
death,' he said in the recording. 'We're very
 grateful. We are very, very lucky.'

The sailboat sank after the bulkhead broke up and the vessel began taking on water, he recalled.

'We had lost everything.'

Except for their Jack Russell Terrier.

Where it happened: The area 900 miles northeast of Bermuda where the boat was found

Coast Guard officials were notified 
Thursday by the International Rescue Center after a message came in 
saying people were in a life raft and needed help.

Coast
 Guard watch standers in Portsmouth, Va., issued a call for help about 
6:30 p.m. to any commercial ships in the vicinity of the life raft. 
Three ships answered the call and diverted their course to aid in the 
search.

The sailboat's crew had an electronic position-indicating radio beacon in the life raft that allowed the Coast Guard to direct ships toward their location.

Poor visibility, 25-foot waves and winds reaching about 40 miles per hour, hampered search efforts as the trio was forced to patch their rickety life raft they held on to 'for dear life.'

The ordeal ended about 12:30 a.m. after the Tilda Kosan diverted course from its planned trip to Mexico. The ship found the life raft after making three passes in dark, stormy conditions. It was about 36 miles away from the life raft when it first joined the search.

'They were fantastic, absolutely fantastic. They didn't play around. They were super quick,' he said of the Coast Guard and his rescuers.

The Tilda Kosan plans to take the sailboat's crew and their dog to Bermuda.
