A drunken thug was jailed for a brutal street attack after his victim’s sister tracked him down on Facebook.

Determined Samantha Beddows, 21, scoured the social networking site for hours looking for the man who beat up her brother Gregg, 24, in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in January this year.

She had recognised the police description of the offender, who had viciously kicked Mr Beddows in the face, fracturing his cheekbone and leaving him unconscious.

After turning Facebook detective, Miss Beddows was able to pin down the identity of her brother’s attacker when she spotted 23-year-old Gareth Collins bragging about the crime on his profile page. 

She realised she had seen him before in her local pub.

She called the police after seeing he had posted a comment boasting about the savage attack saying: 'Ha, ha. Sick ain’t I?'

Police arrested Collins, from Stourbridge, two days after the attack, and he told officers he had drunk six pints of lager because he was feeling down after losing his job at his uncle’s gym.

He claimed he had not wanted to get into a fight and added that he had been 'showing off' when he made the comments on his Facebook site.

Foiled: Clever Miss Beddows, 21, got to watch Collins being sentenced to 32 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court

Defending, Amanda Tompkins told the court her client was full of remorse.

But Miss Beddows saw her devotion to her brother pay off at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday when Collins was jailed for 32 months after pleading guilty to one count of wounding. 

Sentencing him, Judge Amjad Nawaz said: 'It is only by hint of fortune that your kick did not do even more damage.

'Behaviour like this causes fear amongst lawful members of the public who do not want to be confronted by drunken louts.'

After the case, the modest 21-year-old, speaking from her home in Stourbridge, said: 'I’m just happy he’s got what’s coming to home now.

'He’s got what he deserves and that’s all that matters.

'I’m not a hero or anything, he just shouldn’t have kicked my brother in the face.

'It’s just good to know it is all over and he’s behind bars where he should be.'

Mr Beddows, who needed a titanium plate put in his cheek after the attack on Stourbridge High Street, is now making a good recovery.
