An Australian surfer has been missing for over a week in Bali after he failed to return back to his hotel room but left all his belongings behind.

Peter Maynard, from Noosa on  Queensland's Sunshine Coast, was last seen at his hotel, in Nusa Indah Bungalow on Nusa Lembongan, having breakfast on August 26.

It was when Mr Maynard failed to check out on August 28 that staff became suspicious and reported him missing to police.

Hotel owner Made Mariata told Daily Mail Australia Mr Maynard checked in to the hotel on August 23 at midday and was meant to stay for five days.

'Checkout was midday on the 28th and we didn't see him but the key was still at reception. We waited for a long time and then had a look at his room - it has all his bags still there, his passport, his wallet, wet suit and camera.'

Mr Mariata said they then reported him missing to police.

Police are mystified on the whereabouts of the Australian tourist, failing to find any trace of Mr Maynard despite searching the area and speaking with locals.

They said all options have been assessed and nothing adds up. 

'Police have helped us look everywhere - checking the harbour, speaking with the boat company, checking to see if he went snorkelling. 

'We searched until late at night and then continued next morning but we didn't find him.

'We are still looking' 

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they are providing consular assistance to the family and friends of the Australian tourist.

Mr Maynard's wife, Kylie, and his family are flying to Bali to help search for him.

'We hope we find him safe, our fingers are crossed,' Mr Mariata said.
