Wolfsburg produced an impressive second-half fightback to win 5-3 at Werder Bremen and tighten their grip on second place in the Bundesliga.

From 3-2 behind at half-time, manager Dieter Hecking's visitors turned the contest around with two goals from Bas Dost and Daniel Caligiuri's second of the match to inflict a first league defeat of 2015 on Bremen.

Bremen had earlier led three times thanks to Zlatko Junuzovic, Franco Di Santo and a Vieirinha own goal, but Wolfsburg replied through Caligiuri and Maximilian Arnold before the break.
