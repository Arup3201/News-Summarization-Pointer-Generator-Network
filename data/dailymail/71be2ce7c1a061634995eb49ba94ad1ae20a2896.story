Hiatus: Dustin Johnson is to take an immediate break from golf

Johnson 
says he quit the game to seek 'professional help' following a chequered 
personal history which includes a DUI arrest, drug rumours and links to a
 gangland murder.

The
 world number 16, who earlier this year announced his engagement to 
model girlfriend Paulina Gretzky, said he needed the time to focus on 
his mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation.

Johnson,
 30, who finished 12th in The Open two weeks ago and was fourth in the 
US Ryder Cup standings, is well known for leading a party lifestyle that
 led to him being labelled an unfulfilled talent.

The PGA of America confirmed he won’t be part of the United States team at Gleneagles.

European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley seemed to suggest Johnson should have been clearer about his reasons for stepping down.

'We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best,' the US captain, Tom Watson, said.'

As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team.

That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent.'

He told Sky sports:  ‘It’s much better for everyone if there is clarity,’ he said.

‘If something has gone wrong and he has been misbehaving, let’s get it dealt with and move forward.’

At 17 he was arrested for buying bullets that were later used in a gangland murder. In 2009 he was in trouble again after being charged with DUI (driving under the influence).

In May 2012,
 Johnson’s agent David Winkle insisted his client had not been serving a
 drugs suspension from the PGA Tour when he spent three months out of 
the game.

His
 coach Butch Harmon was forthcoming in a 2011 interview, revealing: 
'Dustin and I had a come-to-Jesus conversation about getting his 
personal life in order.

'I
 told him he needs to figure out who he is and how committed he is to 
utilizing his talent. He needs to eliminate some of the, shall we say, 
extracurricular activities. He’s a fun-loving guy, I realize that. But 
there’s a time to play and a time to work and he needs to understand 
that better.’

Johnson
 seemed to have settled down since meeting Gretzky and was an impressive
 winner of the WGC-Champions tournament in Shanghai last November.

Jekyll and Hyde: Talented golfer Johnson has had problems off the golf course in the past

In
 2001, a then 16-year-old Johnson and four other teenagers were involved
 in a burglary during which one of them took a gun.

Johnson
 was later bullied into using fake ID to buy bullets for the gun at 
Wal-Mart by a friend's menacing older brother Steve Gillian.

Later
 that month Gillian was charged with murder after shooting a man named 
Jason Ward multiple times in the head. Gillian was convicted of murder 
and received a life sentence.

Johnson
 had to pay restitution for the burglary and to testify at the trial. In
 2009 he was pardoned by the state of South Carolina.

His
 proposed to girlfriend Paulina Gretzky, daughter of ice hockey legend 
Wayne Gretzky a model and pop star, in August last year.

In
 April, the model and aspiring actress famously posed provocatively the 
cover of Golf Digest magazine wearing a skimpy bikinin top.

Paulina
 first made a name for herself back in 2011 when she posted a steady 
stream of revealing pictures to her Twitter account, including images of
 the model lounging next to the pool in a bikini or suggestively lying 
on a bed in her underwear.

She has appeared in small roles in three films; including 2011's Guns, Girls and Gambling, starring Gary Oldman.

She
 also recorded a song that played on MTV's show Laguna Beach: The Real 
Orange County, and modelled on the front page of Flare magazine in 2008.

More
 recently the aspiring actress played opposite Adam Sandler and Salma 
Hayek in this summer’s comedy sequel Grown Ups 2. Appropriately enough 
Paulina is credited as ‘Bikini Girl Daisy.’

Her
 51-year-old father Wayne is one of the most famous Canadians of all 
time and widely acknowledged to be the greatest ice hockey player who has ever lived.

He played 20 seasons in the NHL and led the Edmonton Oilers to prodigious Stanley Cup success 
in the 80s.

He ended his professional playing career playing three seasons for the New York Rangers, helping them to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1997.
