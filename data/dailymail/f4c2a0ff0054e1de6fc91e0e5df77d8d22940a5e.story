I've faced up to the facts this week and realised that I'm in need of a total body detox. I have been partying far too much recently and iit has taken it's toll on me, and in particular my waistline.

The taut abs of my Men's Health cover (nearly a year ago) have disappeared under, dare I say it, a very slight paunch.

Well, enough is enough. I'm not going back to the bad old days of yo-yo diet Spencer so I've booked into No 1 Boot Camp for a dose of tough love, military style.

Getting down to it: Spencer has travelled to Ibiza to take part in an intense boot camp for two weeks

I got on a plane to visit their camp in Ibiza – it's only a two hour flight and a short car ride and there I was – at their luxury villa near Santa Eularia.

The weigh in came as a shock on day one – 13 stone. Not good. This is ½ stone more than I weighed from my Men's Health challenge, and I've lost a lot of muscle mass and gained fat. But at least I know that with some hard work and determination I can turn it round with a week or two at boot camp.

Taking the strain: Spencer says that he has gained half a stone since his Men's Health cover shoot last year 

I work out: Spencer lifts some weights and works up a sweat

Taking in the view: Spencer goes for a jog on the scenic Ibiza beach

The next morning everything starts with a bang. Loud pumping dance music wakes you (well it is Ibiza after all) at 7am, and if the relentless thud of the bass doesn't get you up the dulcet tones of former RAF Physical Training Instructor (PTI) Andy Morris will. 

Andy motivates all the campers with a special mix of discipline and peer group pressure. He's clearly turned down the volume on what he would have handed out to wannabe fighter pilots in the RAF - his No 1 Boot Camp style is much more about encouragement and getting the best out of people.

And breathe: Spencer looks worn out after an intensive work out

Taking the plunge: Spencer cools off in the villa pool after a day of intense exercise

Out and about: Spencer explores the island while out on a trek 

At 7.30am there is a fitness test in the grounds of the luxurious villa – which is running for 15 minutes, and then a test to see how many sit ups, push ups and burpees you can do.

Then back for breakfast which consists of eggs, mushrooms and spinach – absolutely no toast, bagels or cereals. The food is wheat-free, gluten-free, sugar-free and unprocessed. 

Keeping focus: Spencer says that too much partying has lead him to gain weight and he is prepared to concentrate on his fitness from now on

Working up a sweat: Spencer pushes himself to the limit during an exercising session 

Mind, body, soul: Spencer wants to stays in tune with his body 

At 9.30 we move on to an hour long beach run. It looks more effortless and fun in the photos than it is in real life. It's harder to run on sand than it is on road, and your thighs soon feel the difference.

There is a quick half hour break for some frozen watermelon and nutty energy balls and then it's straight on to gruelling triathlon circuits and sea swimming. If that's not enough, we then have to run back to the villa. I was exhausted.

Lunch is quinoa and stuffed peppers and is tasty and provides a nutrient dense low-carb diet. They don't starve you here, you are given enough to eat, around 1,200 calories a day, but you are probably burning at least 2,000 with the work-outs so you are going to lose weight.

Clean and lean: Spencer's Ibiza diet is completely gluten-free, sugar-free and unprocessed

After lunch it's a weights session followed by all-over resistance circuits – by 3.30pm the most painful bits of the day are done, and then it's down to some games around the pool, and the other campers were really friendly and up for a laugh.

There was time for a bit of lounging by the pool and catching some rays. The weather is still sunny and warm, even though it's not summer any more, and the location and scenery are breathtakingly beautiful.

Making mates: Spencer gushes over a dog during a break from exercising  

Chilling: Spencer takes a well-earned break on a sun lounger after a hard day's work 

Dinner at 6pm was a delicious Cajun baked salmon with mango and avocado salsa and then we settled down for movie night and bed by 9.30pm. Yes, I know that doesn't sound like me but if you don't get a good night's sleep your body simply won't cope the next day.

I've got another week of this to go – if I can stick it out - and then hopefully I will be ripped up and in top shape again. I'll show you next week how I get on.

All the best,

Spencer xxx
