Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin increased his majority in a recall election victory that delivered a warning shot to President Obama and showed that Republican politicians can face down unions and survive in office.

Walker finished with a 7 per cent lead, confounding the exit poll results that had indicated a 50:50 split with Walker's Democratic rival Tom Barrett, mayor of Milwaukee.

Turnout was very heavy and gave Republicans hope that Mitt Romney could prevail in the Democratic-leaning swing state that Obama won comfortably in 2008.

The vote came after a bitter 15-month battle that divided Wisconsin, traditionally a centrist state, with union members and Democrats demonstrating against Walker's signing of a March 2011 law throwing out most collective-bargaining rights from public employees.

In a race that became a nationally-significant contest, more than $63million was spent, most of it from conservative groups backing Walker.

Although both Obama and Romney stayed away, both sides viewed the recall vote as a potential harbinger for November.

Walker said his victory showed that fundamental issues of debt and deficits needed to be addressed, that austerity measures rather than increased spending was needed  and 'voters really do want leaders who stand up and take the tough decisions.'

Voters chanted 'thank you Scott' as the governor proclaimed: 'Now is the time to move forward.'

Walker affirmed his dedication to working with political foes, saying he would have a pow-wow with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over brats, burgers and 'maybe a little bit of good Wisconsin beer.'

Romney said that the 'results will echo beyond the borders of Wisconsin' and Walker had 'demonstrated over the past year what sound fiscal policies can do to turn an economy around, and I believe that in November voters across the country will demonstrate that they want the same in Washington.'

The Obama campaign issued a statement saying: 'While tonight’s outcome was not what we had hoped for - no one can dispute the strong message sent to Governor Walker.

Split on the issue: Both sides mobilized thousands of people and millions of dollars to influence voters, whom polls showed were more divided than ever

‘Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites from all walks of life took a stand against the politics of division and against the flood of secret and corporate money spent on behalf of Scott Walker, which amounted to a massive spending gap of more than $31 million to $4 million.'

Later Tuesday, Barrett conceded to Walker.

In a concession speech, Barrett said: 'It is up to all of us, their side and our side, to listen. To listen to each other.'

The recall effort, a rematch of the 2010 governor's race in the state, was branded a civil war in America's Dairyland.

Barrett often accused Walker of 
neglecting Wisconsin in the interests of boosting his own political 
career by making the state 'the tea party capital of the country.'
