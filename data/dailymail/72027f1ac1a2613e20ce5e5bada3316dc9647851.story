A virus 
carried by mosquitos that has been spreading rapidly in the Caribbean 
has now been found in the US Virgin Islands, local authorities have 
said.

Health
 officials have confirmed the first case of chikungunya, a non-fatal 
virus whose symptoms include a burning fever, headaches and a 
debilitating pain in joints.

No
 information has been released about the first victim but a second 
patient has been infected elsewhere in the three-island group.

Health
 Commissioner Darice Plaskett from St Croix said that local authorities 
are in contact with US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to 
‘raise awareness and prevent the spread of the virus’.

The
 first case of chikungunya was confirmed in the Caribbean in December in
 St Martin, a French territory 230 miles east of Puerto Rico.

The
 virus has spread rapidly since and the Pan American Health Organisation
 has recorded about 135,000 suspected and confirmed cases including 
dozens in French Guiana and Guyana.

There
 is also concern that some American states may have cases from people 
who have recently visited the Caribbean especially as the two species of
 mosquitoes that spread chikungunya are also found in the southern and 
eastern US.

There
 is also a fear that the first local transmissions could occur this 
summer, given the large number of American travellers to the Caribbean.

The
 island of Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and 
Haiti, appears to have been particularly hard-hit by the newly arrived 
virus.

Yesterday,
 the Dominican health ministry reported that tens of thousands of 
suspected cases had been detected in 30 of the country's 32 provinces.

There is no vaccine for chikungunya.
