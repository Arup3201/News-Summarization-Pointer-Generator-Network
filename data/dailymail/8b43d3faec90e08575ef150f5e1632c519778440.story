Martin Montoya will confirm his desire to leave Barcelona on Thursday after failing to get first team football under manager Luis Enrique, with Liverpool and Everton both keen on the full-back.

The Spaniard is also wanted by Juventus, while Arsenal have shown an interest in the 23-year-old who is out of contract in the summer but wants to leave next month.

The young defender has grown disillusioned with a lack of playing time at the Camp Nou, having been frozen out under new coach Enrique. His agent Juan De Dios Carrasco said: 'Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Barcelona to communicate the decision we have already made.

The 23-year-old right back has played just once this season after falling out of favour under Luis Enrique

'He will leave the club in January. There are clubs interested from England, Italy and Germany.'

Carrasco added: 'It is not a problem for Montoya or me, not a problem for us.

'The decision that has been made is because we are seeing the situation and the decisions of Luis Enrique. When a player wants to leave Barca, as Montoya does, I do not think the club will oppose his departure.

'Montoya wants to leave Barcelona and thinks the club is a gentleman and will respect the agreement that he can leave.

Montoya is attracting the attention of the likes of Juventus, as well as teams in England and Germany

Luis Enrique has scarcely used the defender, who played 16 times for Barca last season

'He wants to play. He does not want to stay at Barcelona. And this, when it happens at Barca or Real Madrid, means the player leaves.'

Montoya has made just one single appearance this season for Barcelona, in La Liga. Last term the right-back turned out 13 times in La Liga, four in the Copa del Rey and twice in the Champions League.

Juventus plan to hold talks with Carrasco over the coming days.
