The NSA has a children’s website filled with characters that give the agency a Saturday morning cartoon feel.

Cryptokids comes replete with a buck-toothed rabbit, an Army fatigued-wearing bald eagle and a turtle wearing a backwards ball cap and sunglasses who thinks coding is ‘kewl.’

The site launched in 2005, but the New York Times brought into the broader consciousness Saturday after revelations made by former contractor Edward Snowden have cast an unfavorable light on the spy agency.

Cryptokids: THe NSA's website targeted at the future spies of America

‘In the world of diplomacy, knowing what your enemy is planning helps you to prepare,’ the turtle joyfully says. ‘But it is also important that your enemies do not know what you have planned.’

Children entering the site are treated to loading pages out of the late 1990s that say ‘decrypting information’ whenever clicking on different sections.

Sections include ‘meet the gang,’ operation dit dah,’ ‘make your own secret codes,’ ‘battle of the badges’ and ‘how can I work for the NSA’ aimed at ‘future codemakers and codebreakers.’

‘It is never too early to start thinking about what you want to do when you grow up,’ the site reminds youngsters.

The cartoon characters all have biographies on the site possibly in an attempt to show all the different backgrounds today's spies have emerged from.

Crypto Cat speaks Navajo after growing up next to a reservation, T. Top the turtle has an eight-year-old sister who annoys him ‘out of [his] shell’ and Sergeant Sam is an Eagle in the Central Security Service that ‘learned about duty, honor and integrity’ through serving in the military.

Coding is 'kewl': The cartoon characters attempt to put a hip, young spin on spying

Diverse backgrounds: Each character has a unique upbringing that reflects the limitless boundaries of where the NSA has recruited agents in the past

The cadre of characters guides children through explanations of coding, ciphers, learning morse code and security officer bade identification, among others.

It also tells children how to work for the spy agency.

‘As a signals analyst, you will work with cutting edge technology to recover, understand and derive intelligence from a variety of foreign signals found around the world,’ the site says.

‘You will also attempt to identify the purpose, content, and user of these signals to provide critical intelligence to our nation’s leaders.’

Targeting children is nothing new for the government, the Times notes, several other government agencies including the Department of the Treasury, the State Department and even the National Reconnaissance Office have similar sites.

'What are codes': The site teaches children about coding and breaking codes

Play time: Children are also invited to play games where the make and break codes, as well as use ciphers

America’s Army, released a decade ago, was a video game made by the Army as a recruitment tool at the beginning of the ‘war on terror.’

According to web ranking firm Alexa, the site’s main audience browses from school, is mostly male and predominantly from the U.S.

‘The internet is… great, but there are people out there who don’t have your best interests in mind,’ cybertwin Cy says. ‘Stop and think before sharing private information.’
