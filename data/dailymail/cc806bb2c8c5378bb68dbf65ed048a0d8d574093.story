Is this hanging on your wall? This painting sold for £3,000 on eBay eight years ago, but has now been established as an Impressionist masterpiece

If you paid £3,000 for this painting on eBay eight years ago, you might be sitting on an Impressionist masterpiece – and a small fortune.

It was sold with another which has just been established as the work of French painter Edouard Vuillard, worth around £250,000.

Now experts on the BBC show Fake Or Fortune have appealed for the owner of the eBay painting to come forward so they can tell them the good news.

The antiques programme made the discovery when experts valued a painting owned by the writer Keith Tutt.

He had bought the canvas, now established as the work of French painter Edouard Vuillard, for a knock-down price at an auction.

It had previously been owned by art dealer Robert Warren - who revealed to presenters that it was one of a pair.

He had sold the other painting, which depicts a couple eating oysters and drinking champagne, on eBay but he could not remember who had bought it.

Fiona Bruce, who co-hosts the programme, said: 'You can't miss this painting. It's very large at four feet high and an unusual oval shape.

'Whoever bought it off eBay has bagged themselves the bargain of the century.

'We've done all the forensic and investigative work to prove it's genuine - now we just need to find the owner and tell them the good news.

'Someone, somewhere in the world is sitting on a fortune.'

Another of Vuillard's paintings, called Les Couturieres, sold for more than £5million in a Christie's auction in 2009 and experts value the newly discovered works at around £250,000 each.

Co-presenter Philip Mould said: 'This is a wonderful example of what can happen in this programme.

'In the course of making the programme we
 threw everything into the pot in terms of forensics, science, 
historical (provenance) research, and even established that it been 
painted in distemper made from boiling hot animal glue.

This week a painting of King Henry VIII, which had been hanging in a Wiltshire stately home for more than 300 years, jumped in value from £10,000 to £1 million after experts decided it was the last painted before his death.

They dated the oil painting to 1547 by studying tree rings in the oak panel on which it was created.

In September, meanwhile, a lost Van Gogh painting found in a Norwegian attic was finally confirmed as a work of the tortured artist, despite the fact he was not proud enough of it to sign the canvas.
