Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki have formed a blossoming friendship over the past few months.

Williams was waiting at the finish line as Wozniacki ran the New York Marathon before attending a fashion awards ceremony the following day.

They were also seen watching the New York Knicks in action.

And now, the pair have recently been pictured enjoying an end of season break in the Bahamas.

Wozniacki, of Denmark, competed in the New York marathon in an impressive time of three hours and 26 minutes at the beginning of November.

And her colleague and friend Williams was waiting to greet her as she crossed the finish line.

Wozniacki, who posted another picture on Instagram before the race, raised over $81,000 for charity by completing the marathon.

Wozniacki seemed excited for the New York marathon, and posted this photo on Instagram post beforehand

Wozniacki barely had time to recover from her running exploits by the time they were next spotted out together, as the pair were in attendance for a fashion event at Spring Studios.

They were even photographed with fashion designer Stella McCartney.

But their antics did not stop there, as they were soon out and about in New York again, watching the New York Nicks play at Madison Square Gardens.

The pair were seen laughing and joking throughout the match, as they made yet another public appearance

Their presence did not bring any luck for the Nicks, though, as they were beaten 98-83 by the Washington Wizards.

Wozniacki and Williams have been enjoying themselves in the past couple of weeks, and where tennis's new blossoming friendship will show up after holidaying in the Bahamas remains to be seen.
