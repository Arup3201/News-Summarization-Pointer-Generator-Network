A schoolgirl who became stuck in a drain while trying to retrieve her iPhone has defended her decision to squeeze down the narrow gap to grab it.

Ella Birchenough, 16, said that nobody dissuaded her from the idea, as she pulled up the heavy drain cover weighing 22 kg (around 3 stone) to retrieve her two-week-old iPhone 5S, which she was unaware was insured. 

Miss Birchenough said: ''I could reach the floor of the drain, so when I got pulled out I went back in. Nobody said don't do it, they were just looking at me as though I was nuts.'

The teenager became caught in the storm drain in an attempt to retrieve her phone - the part of the storm drain she picked up apparently weighed 22 kg

After unsuccessful attempts from friends and family, as well as many, many cameraphone pictures, firefighters were eventually called to hoist her out

Eyewitnesses to the event claimed that
 while the incident on Eaves Road in Dover, Kent, was embarrassing, she 
remained in high spirits throughout.

In an interview with ITV's Daybreak, Miss Birchenough continued to explain how she came to get stuck in the drain, and how the original pictures, which went viral, were actually taken by her mother.

She said: 'I dropped the iPhone down the drain, and tried reaching for it, but couldn't get it.

'In the end, I couldn't pull myself out.' 

Miss Birchenough appeared on ITV's Daybreak with her friend Tim Richards, 22, who attempted to help her out of the drain, to defend her decision

Miss Birchenough made it clear in the interview that most of the people around her during the event saw the funny side, including her mother, who she said took the original picture

Her mother and her friend had been responsible for the original picture, which has become a sensation around the country, being posted on Facebook, after her initial panic turned to amusement.

Miss Birchenough said: 'She rounded the corner as white as a sheet, and then started laughing and took a photo.'

Tim Richards, 22, an eyewitness and friend who came to her rescue after seeing Miss Birchenough in the drain on a drive with his mother, said how situation was unique.

He said: 'She was in high spirits, with a smile on her face, which you certainly don't expect to see on a girl stuck down a drain.

Her friend Tim Richards (right) was driving past when he saw his friend trapped in the drain, before hopping out because he 'needed to take a picture'

'When I saw her I said to my mum "Stop the car. I need to take a picture of this."

'We did try and pull her out, but after a while in there she had no upper body strength.'

Miss Birchenough also said how she was going to manage 'horribly' without her iPhone for the time being.

And after the retrieval attempt garnered Miss Birchenough much embarrasment, it has been revealed that it was all for nothing, as the iPhone 5S, which was on a contract, was broken completely.

Her mother, Mrs Birchenough, has since joked that she will be bringing out the pictures of her daughter in the drain on her 18th birthday and wedding day.

Ella-Anne Birchenough, 16, managed to squeeze down the small drain on her street in Dover, Kent

Taxi firm worker Mrs Birchenough, 36, said: 'I think it's the funniest thing. At first I panicked, thinking "Oh my God, she's going to sink".

'But when I saw her it made me laugh. She is upset about her phone, but at the end of the day at least she's alright.'

While Miss Birchenough has been able to see the funny side, some eyewitnesses were not so amused, with one calling the event 'pure stupidity'

Eyewitnesses to the event had mixed opinions about the entire situation, with some seeing the funny side, and others branding Miss Birchenough's dip into the drain deeply irresponsible.

One eyewitness said: 'It was pure stupidity, seeing the size of the girl, she shouldn't have gone down the drain in the first place.

It could have been a lot worse than it was.

Another said: 'I don't think I'm going to see something like that again in my entire life.

'I hope I do, because it was amazing.'

Kent Fire and Rescue issued a statement that said: 'We're really happy that there was a good outcome and that Ella was able to laugh about it.

'But obviously with the recent weather a number of things could have washed down drains - she didn't know what was underneath her, it could have been unstable.

'We'd urge people to think carefully before trying to retrieve their objects.'

Kent County Council said: 'This event does just go to show how clean our drains are, that she managed to open the drain without it getting stuck on muck and grime.'
