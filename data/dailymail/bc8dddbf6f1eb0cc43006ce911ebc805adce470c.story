As a self appointed icon of style, it's no surprise that Cristiano Ronaldo arrived fashionably late for the World Cup party in Brazil.

Portugal became the last team to to touch down for the tournament after landing at Viracopos airport in Campinas on Wednesday - the day before the curtain is raised on the greatest show on earth.

Ronaldo and his teammates still have one week to acclimatise to conditions with their opening game against Germany set to take place on June 16.

With his cap on backwards and wearing glasses, Ronaldo took his first few steps in Brazil on with no sign of the left leg injuries that have troubled the world player of the year's buildup.

Ronaldo strolled off Portugal's plane as the squad flew in a day after a 5-1 friendly win over Ireland in the United States. The victory was his comeback game after being sidelined for two few weeks with tendinitis in the knee and a thigh problem, both in his left leg.

The Portuguese captain and playmaker lifted his hand and coolly pointed his finger to acknowledge fans who called out "Ronaldo!" as he made his way across the tarmac at an airport near Campinas, a city around 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Brazil's business capital Sao Paulo. Portugal will be based in Campinas.

On the other side of the runway, construction workers in red uniforms abandoned their jobs temporarily and lined up along a fence, straining their eyes to try and catch a glimpse of the Real Madrid star.

last one out: Portugal coach Paulo Bento follows the players off the plane

Ronaldo
 started the easy win over the Irish in New Jersey on Tuesday night and 
played 65 minutes, easing fears over his fitness for Portugal's opening 
game against Germany on Monday. Defender Fabio Coentrao said that 
victory in Portugal's final tuneup was an important boost.

'Of course, a 5-1 victory has given us a lot of confidence,' Coentrao said.

Coach
 Paulo Bento, who led the players off the plane wearing a team 
tracksuit, didn't talk directly about Ronaldo's return from injury in 
East Rutherford, his first game since the May 24 Champions League final.
 Bento did say said there was a general feeling of ease in the camp.

'We
 are trying to rest as much as we can but still we have to be ready for 
the first game that we play," Bento said. "We have come through a 
process and we have had some difficulties at certain points. It has been
 a bit more complicated than usual but we have made it.'

The coach also called for some local support for his team.

To
 encourage that and to get off on the right foot, Portugal's plane flew 
the Portuguese and Brazilian flags side by side out of the window of the
 cockpit as it taxied toward the parking bay.

We hope for, we wish for and we desire the support of the Brazilian people," Bento told reporters on the tarmac.

Portugal faces Germany, the United States and Ghana in Group G.
