Rising from a dry dock, this is America's latest and possibly costliest piece of military machinery ever constructed.

The world's only superpower has released details of its new generation of aircraft carriers - the first of which costs a staggering $13billion - which it hopes will enable it to dominate any battlefield for decades to come.

But that sort of money buys an incredible amount of firepower, with the ship stuffed with cutting-edge and top secret technology.

The $13billion USS Gerald R. Ford will be one of the most fearsome weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal

When finished, the giant 1,106-foot USS Gerald R. Ford 
will be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors 
and marines, and be virtually invisible to enemy radar.

The Navy also plans to buy another three such carriers, at a cost of $43 billion, to complete its fleet.

But the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price, with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $3billion and major delays.

Beci
 Brenton, spokesman for Huntington Ingalls Industries, the maker of the 
ship, told FoxNews.com: 'The structure has been rearranged to 
accommodate new technology and meet all of the Navy’s operational 
requirements.

The
 ship’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete, Brenton 
said. But internal connections and features inside the ship are still 
being added.

The ship began construction in Newport News, Virginia, in 2007, but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016.

The carrier would be fully capable by February 2019, according to a critical watchdog report.

Delays
 ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in 
testing three of the ship’s most important new advances: its dual band 
radar, arresting gear and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System 
that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues.

And
 the spiralling costs come at a time when the Navy is seaching for ways 
to plug a $14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the
 automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration.

The state-of-the-art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters, including the government's own watchdogs.

In

 a report earlier this month the Government Accountability Office wrote:
 'Key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the Navy does not 
expect to resolve until many years after [Ford] commissioning, which 
will limit the ship’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments 
and likely increase costs to the government.'

It added: 'The Navy faces technical, design, and construction challenges to 
completing Gerald R. Ford that have led to significant cost increases.'

National 
security experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
the Brookings Institution, have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts.

'I’m not persuaded they’re worth twice what the old carriers cost,' Michael O’Hanlon, of Brookings, told FoxNews.com.
