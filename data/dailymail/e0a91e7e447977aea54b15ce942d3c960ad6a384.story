A group of Republican governors tore into President Barack Obama on Wednesday over his forthcoming immigration directive and threatened to sue him for breaking the law.

'I would go to the courts,' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday during an annual retreat for the party's chief executives. 'This is illegal.'

Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry accused Obama of 'sticking his finger into the eye of the American people' and said his state may take legal action against the president, too.

The outgoing governor of Texas said its a 'possibility' his state would sue the president over immigration

'I think that’s probably a very real possibility,' Perry, a probably 2016 presidential candidate, said.

The comments came during a panel at the Republican Governors Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, Wednesday afternoon, hours after the White House announced via a Facebook video that Obama would finally make public his immigration plans during a prime-time address on Thursday evening.

The following day he will sign any official paperwork associated with his declaration during a rally at a Las Vegas, Nevada, high school.

The president's speech detailing the major policy adjustment will be mostly unseen by Americans when it airs, however, as ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox will not carry it live.

According to news reports, the White House put out feelers to the networks about having his remarks broadcast but they seemed unwilling to preempt hit shows that evening. As a result, the president's press shop never put in an official request to have it aired during primetime and regular programming will proceed as usual.

The White House will air the speech on its website, though, and interested Americans can watch it there at 8 p.m. EST or on a handful of other networks, including Spanish-language channels Univision and Telemundo, as well as CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. 

Univision is planning to interrupt it's telecast of the Latin Grammy's to air it, the Washington Post has confirmed.

What the president will say is still a mystery. The White House has been tight-lipped in its descriptions of the president's plans during its daily dealings with reporters.

Numerous news publications have reported his executive order will include work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants, namely those who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2010 and those who have American citizen children.

It is also also expected to authorize a half million new work permits for foreigners who graduated from U.S. colleges and obtained degrees in subjects like science and engineering.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that the planned executive actions would affect immigrants who 'have deep ties in America, are law-abiding and have children or spouses who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.'

Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez said Tuesday he believed the president would issue two-year work permits to illegal immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least live years, and possibly 10, as long as they pay for and pass a background check. 

'You're going to submit your fingerprints and if they come back clear, he is going to give you a work authorization for two years and a Social Security card. He's going to put you on the books paying taxes,' Gutierrez told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly.

He also suggested Obama's directive would provide allow an untold number of agricultural workers to stay in the U.S. legally.

Whatever action the president takes is likely to be unpopular with Americans, though.

An NBC/WSJ poll conducted last weekend found that 48 percent of Americans opposed the president making changes to the immigration system through an executive order, and just 38 percent were for it.  

Republican governors - many of whom are mulling presidential bids next year - were fuming over the rumored proposals on Wednesday afternoon, saying they would place numerous burdens on their states.

Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback worried about the logistics of providing driver's licences to illegal immigrants shielded from deportation by Obama.

'That would be very difficult in our state,' he said, according to the New York Times.

Meanwhile, Maine Gov. Paul LePage called the idea of expanding work permits in his state to accommodate Obama's order 'unacceptable.'

'I am fighting it, not helping it,' he said.

Recalling the difficulty he and his wife experienced while trying to obtain legal documents for a Jamaican teenager they were caring for, LePage explained it took them 'nearly 11 years' to finish the paperwork.

'Why should everybody just get one tomorrow?' he pondered.

Meanwhile, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a former federal lawmaker, endorsed a strategy under consideration by congressional Republicans to 'use the power of the purse to work the will of the American people.' 

'Every major change in the life of our nation has been done with the consent of our government,' a visibly upset Pence reportedly said.

'I think it would be a profound mistake' for the president to act unilaterally, he added.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie refused to engage on the subject of illegal immigration at all, saying as he had several times in the past, that he would make his views on federal issues known when and if he runs for president.

But he did come out swinging against Republicans in Congress floating a government shut down unless Democrats go along with their plan to bar immigration agencies from using federal funds to support Obama's edict.

'It’s incumbent upon everybody in Washington, D.C., to do their jobs. And running the government is their job,' Christie said. 'All this kind of hysteria about shutdowns to me is just people who can make news.'

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal  said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight, it would be the president's fault for not signing the GOP's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was also reticent to share his personal views on immigration reform, telling his peers, 'we will deal with people here illegally compassionately and fairly' and calling for enhanced security at America's southern border. 

Weighing in on the issue before Congress, though, he said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight, it would be the president's fault for not signing the GOP's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order.

'I don’t think the president should shut down the government simply because he wants to break the law,' Jindal said.

Only Ohio Gov. John Kasich indicated a willingness to embrace amnesty for illegal immigrants currently residing in the country, telling his fellow GOP governors, 'We’ve got to think about what’s going to bring about healing.'

'I don’t like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line. We may have to do it.'

'I’m open to it, I will tell you that,' Kasich, a possible dark horse presidential candidate, added. 

Wisconsin's Walker warned his allies not to be so distracted by Obama's immigration actions that they lose focus on other important issues like the economy, taxes, energy and education, however.

The Associated Press said Walker characterized the president's latest move as a 'cynical ploy' to blind Republicans to divert Republicans' attention away from other more pressing issues.

'Come out with me on the road and I’ll tell you there aren’t a whole lot of people talking about immigration reform,' Walker told them.
