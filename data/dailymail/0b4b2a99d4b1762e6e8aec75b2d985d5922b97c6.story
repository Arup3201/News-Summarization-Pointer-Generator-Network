A soldier who guards the Queen at Windsor Castle and his primary school teacher wife have appeared in court charged with raping a pre-teenage girl.

Simon Davies, 37, and wife Fiona, 44, 
were held by police after a video of the alleged incident was found 
during a raid on a London home.

Police swooped on the house as part of 
an investigation into a child porn ring. It is believed the footage was 
being circulated online by paedophiles.

Housed: Davies is based at Combermere Barracks, where Princes William and Harry served before starting their careers of flying military helicopters

The husband and wife appeared in custody at Reading Magistrates' Court earlier this week over offences alleged to have occurred in January.

Davies is charged with three counts of rape of a child under 13 years, while Parsons-Davies is accused of rape, aiding and abetting rape and child neglect.

Two of the rapes were said to have taken place on January 26 and 28.

They were both remanded in custody to appear at Reading Crown Court on December 15.

A team of officers had raided Davies' terraced house on Windsor's Broom Farm estate - just two miles from the Castle where he guards the Queen when she is in residence.

A neighbour told the Sun: 'Police have been here for five days and won't say what is going on.

'They have warned us that if any of us know and tell anyone else, we could find ourselves under arrest.

'The man who was arrested was a member of the Household Cavalry, as are most of the families here.'

He was allegedly identified from the video clip by specialist officers who traced the file through various internet service providers.

Davies, who has fought in Afghanistan, and his wife were questioned by detectives separately over the weekend.

The Household Cavalry - made up of the Blues & Royals and Life Guards - is responsible for guard duty at Windsor Castle along with mounted and gate duty at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace.

Davies is based at Windsor's Combermere Barracks, where Prince William and Prince Harry served before starting their careers of flying military helicopters.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The matter is subject to a civil police investigation and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further whilst this is ongoing.'
