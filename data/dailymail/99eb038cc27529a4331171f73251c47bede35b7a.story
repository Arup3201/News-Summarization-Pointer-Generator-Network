Louis van Gaal's expensively-assembled Manchester United have come together for the team's official photograph on the back of their first Premier League win of the season. 

Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie were all smiles as United posed for the annual snap.   

Van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps of last year's disappointment in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester.

They managed to offload the likes of Danny Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hernandez, although the trio will be in Champions League action this week while team-mates at their old side are watching at home.

A LOOK AT WHO  DEPARTED OLD TRAFFORD THIS SUMMER

Danny Welbeck (back row, far left)

The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game.

Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century'

Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right)

The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road.

Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right)

Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan.

Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right)

Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark.

Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left)

Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton.

Alexander Buttner moved from Manchester United to Dynamo Moscow after two years at Old Trafford

Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right)

Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary.

Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left)

Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract.

Nani (front row, fourth from left)

Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals.

Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left)

The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties.

Manager David Moyes (front row, centre)

United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking.

Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right)

After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough. The centre-back joined Inter Milan after seeing out his contract.

Nemanja Vidic spent eight years at Manchester United and won five Premier League titles during his stint

Coach Jimmy Lumsden (front row, fifth from right)

Another to suffer the same fate as Moyes. Lumsden parted company with the club at the same time as assistant manager Round after it all fell apart at Old Trafford.

Patrice Evra (front row, fourth from right)

After a mammoth 273 Premier League appearances, Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two-year deal. The fee was £1.2m for the 33-year-old, who now seems destined to see out his career in Italy.

Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez (front row, third from right)

Hernandez was surplus to requirements up front and fell behind in the pecking order, particularly with the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The striker joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan and the Spanish giants have the option to buy at the end of the deal.

Javier Hernandez became surplus to requirements at Manchester United and fell behind the pecking order

Mexico international Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on a one-year loan deal with an option to buy

Tom Cleverley (front row, second from right)

Cleverley has been in and out of Manchester since 2009, taking in loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan, and the midfielder has joined Aston Villa for another temporary spell. The 25-year-old would have warmed the bench with Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arriving as summer signings.

Everton attempted to sign Tom Cleverely on deadline day but the midfielder joined Aston Villa

Tom Cleverley avoided warming the bench at Manchester United by joining Aston Villa late on deadline day

And the rest:

Chris Woods - goalkeeping coach - Woods was told alongside Phil Neville that he would no longer be needed at the club after Moyes' departure in May.

Rob Swire - physio - retired in July after being at Manchester United since 1999. He was replaced by assistant Neil Hough.
