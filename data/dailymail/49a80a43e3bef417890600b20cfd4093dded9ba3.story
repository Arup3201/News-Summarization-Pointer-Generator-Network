The scientist who pioneered the cervical cancer vaccine was found dead by her husband at their £2million home after he warned she was ‘heading for a crisis’ by working too hard.

Dr Anne Szarewski, 53, a university lecturer whose discovery has saved thousands of lives, was begged to slow down by her husband, who was becoming increasingly concerned about the pressure she was putting on herself.

In August he found her dead in their four-bedroom home in West Hampstead, north London, after he spent two hours drilling through a door she had locked from the inside.

Mystery: Doctors are still at a loss to explain Dr Anne Szarewski's death in her Hampstead home in August

Doctors are still at a loss to explain what exactly caused the researcher’s death.

She was found with high levels of an anti-malarial drug in her bloodstream, but doctors said this was not thought to have caused her death.

Her husband Lester Venter said that, before her death, he and many of her friends had become extremely worried about her heavy workload.

Dr Szarewski, who used her maiden name, was preparing for five international work trips and had been complaining that she was experiencing all-over body pains with ‘mounting intensity’.

Mr Venter, 63, told the inquest into her death at St Pancras Coroner’s Court: ‘I was in the habit of telling her that she was heading for a crisis. I just realised she couldn’t maintain the pace that she was setting for herself.’

Dr Szarewski is credited with 
discovering the link between the human papillomavirus and cervical 
cancer, leading to a vaccine for HPV – the first-ever vaccine against 
any form of cancer – which is now routinely given to girls across the 
country.

Her husband described her work as ‘nothing short of historic’.

Born
 in London to Polish parents, she studied medicine at Middlesex Hospital
 before working at the Whittington Hospital in Highgate, North London.

Latterly
 she worked as a gynaecologist at the Margaret Pike Centre in King’s 
Cross, was a clinical lecturer at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary, 
University of London, and also worked for Cancer Research.

Her
 husband of ten years, a former political journalist from South Africa, 
told the court the couple slept in separate bedrooms because they 
enjoyed their own space.

Mr 
Venter said that he woke up on August 24 after a night at the theatre 
and when his wife did not come down for breakfast he was initially 
pleased that she was having a well-deserved lie-in.

When she still had not emerged at 2pm, however, he became concerned and found her bedroom door was locked.

After
 two hours trying to open it with an electric drill, he forced his way 
inside. ‘As I entered the room I saw her on the bed and I realised 
straight away that she was dead,’ he said.

The
 couple’s home contained two-and-a-half cupboards of medication, a 
collection Mr Venter described as one of his wife’s ‘charming 
eccentricities’.

A pathologist’s report read out to the inquest found the scientist died with a fatally inflamed pancreas.

'She was unique. She was cheerful, erudite and quite the finest person it has been my privilege to know. On the scientific level, her achievements have been nothing short of historic'

The
 anti-malaria drug Chloroquine was discovered in her blood. It is known 
to be highly toxic in overdose quantities. A packet was later found in 
the house but this is not thought to have been the cause of death and 
the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.

Mr Venter said he had received messages ‘from all over the world’ in tribute to the ‘extraordinary woman’ he had married.

‘I
 needed no reminding,’ he said. ‘She was unique. She was cheerful, 
erudite and quite the finest person it has been my privilege to know.

‘On the scientific level, her achievements have been nothing short of historic.

‘Her
 discovery of the cause of cervical cancer led to the first-ever vaccine
 against any form of cancer. Women all over the world are now getting 
the vaccine and thousands owe their lives to Anne’s work.

‘We had a wonderful life. I am heartbroken that it has been cut short.

‘But I will remain boundlessly proud of my wife for as long as I will miss her, which is till the end of my days.’
