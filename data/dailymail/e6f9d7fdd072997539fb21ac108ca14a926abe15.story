This is the moment an alleged thief's Houdini-style escape from a Walmart store was branded 'insane' after he climbed up into a ceiling, kicked his way out, and ran out of the front door.

The man, who earned the nickname 'Spiderman' from employees, was caught on video staging the daredevil escape in Mobile, Alabama.

He was first cornered by Walmart employees at the front door of the store after he allegedly grabbed a debit card, shoes, hat, watch and underwear.

Dangling: Eyewitnesses heard a large banging sound above and saw the man kick out a portion of the ceiling, where he dangled from the hole, pictured,

Brannan Lynn, an eyewitness, caught all of the action on camera while he and his father ate at the adjacent McDonald's.

They watched as the thief was dragged to a security office but somehow managed to crawl into the ceiling.

Lynn said he heard a large banging sound above him and witnessed the man kick out a portion of the ceiling, where he dangled from the hole, balanced on top of the door's frame, then fled.

Lynn told AL.com: 'It was insane. It was unbelievable the great timing he had.' 

Stunned onlookers were unable to stop the suspect as he sprinted out to the parking lot, jumped into a red car, and made his escape.

Mobile Police Officer Terence Perkins said the suspect dropped all of the stolen items before fleeing Walmart.

Police said he has not been caught and is still at large.
