With fears over the spread of Ebola, the crisis in Iraq and Syria and even the crowning of a new Great British Bake Off Champion, news bulletins have been rather full in recent days.

But today, on  BBC News at least, there appeared to be a lack of stories as the midday broadcast opened with a view of an empty chair.

The camera zoomed in to the familiar desk, but in the spot where the presenter usually sits was an empty chair, with newsreader Joanna Gosling nowhere to be seen.

No news today? The BBC News midday bulletin opened with a shot of an empty chair, and the presenter Joanna Gosling nowhere to be seen 

Empty:The camera zoomed in to the familiar desk, but the newsreader's chair was empty

Preparations: With Ms Gosling not seated, the sound of footsteps and rustling paper could be heard out of shot

The bulletin had started, as usual, with a shot of the studio, where 43-year-old Ms Gosling could be seen walking around the desk.

She was not seated as the camera cut to the office chair where she should have been, and soon the sound of footsteps and rustling paper could be heard out of shot.

But as Ms Gosling sat down, around 30 seconds into the broadcast, she was cool personified, calmly apologising for a 'technical blip' and continuing as usual.

'Good afternoon, sorry for the technical blip there but we have got plenty of breaking news to bring you so let's get on with it,' she said with a smile.

A BBC spokesman said Ms Gosling had intended to present the lead story from another part of the studio.

'After reading the headlines she moved across the studio to the big screen to present the top story standing up,' the spokesman said.

'However an operational glitch meant she couldn't be seen there and she had to return to the desk, which was why there was a brief pause and a reference to a technical blip.' 

Her unflustered reaction  won support from viewers on Twitter, who praised the journalist for styling out the blunder.

Praise: Ms Gosling's unflustered reaction also won support from viewers on Twitter, who praised the journalist for styling out the blunder

Support: Anne Alexander, a producer for ITV rival Good Morning Britain, commended Ms Gosling for her 'cool'

Twitter user @SynopsisMoo added: '@JoannaGosling Think u did a Gr8 job with camera in the wrong place ... ;-)'

And Anne Alexander, a producer for ITV rival Good Morning Britain, said: 'BBC 12 news bulletin started with shot of empty chair. Off air footsteps + newsreader finally appears. Hat off to J Gosling for keeping cool.'

It was a far cry from an incident in 2006, in which Ms Gosling, who has worked for the BBC since 1999, forgot the name of her co-presenter Julian Worricker during a BBC News 24 broadcast.

She ended up in a fit of giggles, continuing to laugh as the headlines were read out, in an incident which often makes lists of the greatest on-air gaffes.
