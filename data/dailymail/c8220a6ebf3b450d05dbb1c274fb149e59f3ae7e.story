Imran Khan and his new wife faced angry protests from parents during a visit to the Pakistan school where 132 pupils were massacred by the Taliban.

The newlyweds attended the Army Public School in Peshawar yesterday to express their condolences a month after the country's worst ever terrorist attack.

But the trip quickly descended into a public relations nightmare when they were met by a crowds of grieving relatives chanting: 'Go Imran go!'

Some tried to blockade the road to prevent his convoy from entering the school grounds.

They were furious that Mr Khan had chosen to marry BBC weather girl Reham Khan three weeks after the massacre instead of spending his time remembering victims of the atrocity.

One mother told The Times: 'For one whole day, the [media] showed [Imran Khan's] wedding and valima [wedding banquet].

'They were not showing anything about the children anymore. Nobody cares and he came to visit after a month.'

Some also accused him of staging a media stunt 'to show fake prayers and condolences.'

The school re-opened on Monday for the first time since the attack to offer chldren and teachers a week of counselling before lessons start again.

Mr Khan told parents that he respected their demonstrations, adding: 'I fully understand their grief. They have lost children.' 

The marriage has already caused huge controversy in Pakistan where Mr Khan is chairman of opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

The party controls the government of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. 

The formal wedding announcement came after a turbulent few weeks for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan.

Many conservative Pakistanis believe his marriage to a British-Pakistani divorcee is an unsuitable union for right-winger who has made great play of his Islamic faith.

Mr Khan tied the knot with Mrs Khan at his home in Islamabad last week - but not single member of his family was invited.

His sisters did not attend the 'nikkah' - Islamic marriage ceremony - amid reports they do not approve of the match. 

Aleema Khan said: 'We were neither aware nor informed of the nikkah prior to this.'

A head boy has told how he survived the Pakistan school massacre by hiding in a bathroom for five hours after watching his best friends die in the attack.

Muneeb Ullah Shah (pictured right) said was attending a first aid class in the school auditorium when Taliban militants burst into the room in a hail of gunfire.

He said: 'The back doors of the auditorium were locked, but the terrorists just opened the door very forcefully and then they just started firing.

'Everyone was rushing out of the auditorium. 

'They started firing at two doors - one on the left hand side of the room and the other on the right side. 

'I went to the left door and as I was going out, they started firing.' 

A single bullet grazed his upper left arm, ripping his white school shirt and breaking the skin - staining a patch of his white school shirt in blood.

Muneeb added: 'My mind was not working. I ran to the staff room, one of the teachers was there and told me to hide in the washroom. Five to ten minutes later, there was some firing.

'I was very scared because I knew that meant the terrorists were nearby. 

'They broke the door of the staff room, then they started firing, bombs were blasting, we were just praying to Allah.

'I thought "this is my last moment". I was praying. Every door and window was broken, there was nothing left but one door, which was the washroom door which was closed.

'The terrorists were shouting and giving instructions. We were there for five hours.

'When the Pakistani army started their search operation, we thought we had a chance of surviving, but there was still a lot of blasts, so my ears weren't working.'

The teenager, who is planning to train as an engineer, was eventually rescued by the Pakistani Army after the last of the terrorists were killed.

He was eventually able to relay word to his father, who fell to the floor with joy. 

Finally: Imran Khan married his fiance, Reham, at an intimate wedding ceremony in Islamabad

However the bride's mother, sister and two close friends were all present for the intimate ceremony, according to her nephew Yusuf Khan.

He said: 'The majority of our family lives in UK and USA and that is the reason only my mother, grandmother and I attended it from close family.'

Mr Khan's spokesman said the wedding was kept small to honour the 145 victims of the terrorist attack on the school in Peshawar.

Formalities: A close friend of Imran Khan's confirmed that a dowry of 82,000 rupees - around £850 - was agreed for the bride

Spokesman Naeemul Haq said:  'We did not want to celebrate it in big way due to the Peshawar school massacre.

'They look very elegant together. It is the biggest news of the new year for the people of Pakistan.'

Imran Khan's sister, Aleema, confirmed that none of his family were present and said they were never asked to attend.  

Aleema Khan said: 'We, all the sisters, were never informed or contacted by Imran so there was no question to attend it. All of us are in Lahore.'

Zakir Khan, a close friend of Mr Khan's who witnessed the marriage, confirmed the dowry, a ceremonial fee paid for the bride, was 82,000 rupees - around £850. 

A friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. 

Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV

Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop.

A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'.

The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed.

'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' 

Mr Khan previously spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. 

Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend.
