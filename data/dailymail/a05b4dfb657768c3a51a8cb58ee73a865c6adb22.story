Hefty bonus: Antony Jenkins, who receives £5.5m a year, was immediately accused of being ‘out of touch’ over the 'pie in the sky' comments

The boss of Barclays has called for an end to free banking, claiming the controversial move would be a ‘step forward’ for customers.

Antony Jenkins, who said he would not make the first move in case it scared off customers, was immediately accused of being ‘out of touch’.

His comments came as the High Street giant unveiled another big pay-day for staff. Mr Jenkins’ total package more than tripled from £1.6million in 2013 to £5.5million last year.

Asked whether he would approve of free in-credit bank accounts being outlawed and charges introduced across the board, he said: ‘I do think that would be a step forward, yes.

‘It’s difficult to achieve of course because the banks can’t do that. It would probably have to be regulated or legislated.’

He told ITV News it was unlikely that any bank would make the first move in case it lost business.

John Mann, a member of the Treasury committee, said last night: ‘He lives in a different world from the rest of us. People on lower incomes would suffer. This shows how out of touch Mr Jenkins is, as so many customers value free bank accounts.’

Mr Jenkins came under fire last year when he argued that closing bank branches would lead to a ‘better customer experience’ as current account holders are increasingly banking online.

James Daley of consumer group Fairer Finance said his latest comments were ‘pie in the sky’, adding: ‘To try and scrap the free in-credit banking system we have now would be incredibly unpopular.

'No government would legislate for it – it would be a vote loser because more people benefit from it [free banking] than lose out’.

But Mr Jenkins has the support of senior regulators including Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has called free banking a ‘dangerous myth’ – partly due to the confusing array of hefty charges for the millions who go overdrawn.

Supporters of packaged accounts – which can cost around £15 a month and typically include ‘perks’ such as travel insurance – also claim banks will be less likely to mis-sell other products.

But latest figures from the Financial Ombudsman show complaints from customers who believe they were mis-sold packaged accounts have soared.

Royal Bank of Scotland last week revealed it had set aside £150million to compensate customers mis-sold packaged accounts.

The row came as Mr Jenkins was forced to defend his decision to accept a £1.1million bonus for last year, despite cutting 14,000 jobs.

The 53-year-old insisted the decision was ‘appropriate’, saying: ‘You have to look at the very significant progress we’ve made in the two-and-a-half years that I have been chief executive.’

Barclays has set aside almost £1.3billion to pay likely fines for rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. This helped drag down profits by 21 per cent to £2.3billion.

A spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign said: ‘Bonus season has again been dominated by pay controversies, scandals and fines – underlining that too little reform has taken place.’
