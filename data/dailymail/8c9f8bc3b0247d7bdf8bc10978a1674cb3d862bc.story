The vandalized home is where Rosa Parks lived when she made history by refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person

Copper thieves have struck the Alabama apartment complex where Rosa Parks lived when she made history by refusing to give up her seat to a white person on a city bus.

Detectives in Montgomery are seeking suspects who ripped and stole wiring from Parks' former apartment, which is now a mini-museum to her life, and six other now-vacant units being renovated.

There are now ripped walls and flipped counter tops, WSFA reported.

Several mementos of Parks' life, from her sewing machine to furniture, are still inside.

Sgt.
 Denise Barnes said workers discovered the thefts Monday. Police believe
 the crimes happened over the weekend.

The place was added to the Alabama 
Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 1989 and the National Register of 
Historic Places in 2001.

Parks lived there from 1955 to 1956 with her husband Raymond and her mother, Leona McCauley, the Montgomery Advertiser reported.

The apartment at 634 
Cleveland Court is listed as Parks' address in the 1955 police report 
following her arrest on a Montgomery city bus.

Parks' apartment, along with several other units in the complex, are undergoing restorations and remain unoccupied

Her refusal to give up her seat in defiance of a Montgomery law sparked a yearlong bus boycott and became an enduring symbol of the U.S. Civil Rights movement.

Parks and her husband eventually moved to Detroit.

She died there at the age of 92 on Oct. 24, 2005.
