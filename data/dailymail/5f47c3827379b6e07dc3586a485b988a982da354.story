With a twisted and tilted body, England’s oldest smock mill was about to fall down after three proud centuries of displaying its industrial strength.

But thanks to a 15-year restoration effort led by the bouncing bomb inventor's son, the Lacey Green Windmill in Buckinghamshire is back to its best.

The mill was falling down in the 1970s when a team of volunteers decided to return it to its former glory, which prompted a mammoth restoration effort.

Impressive: Lacey Green Windmill is pictured today near Princes Risbourgh, Buckinghamshire. It is the oldest working smock windmill in England, dating back to 1650

Reconstruction: The mill was falling down in 1969 when volunteers decided to return it to its former glory, which prompted a huge restoration effort, seen (right) in 1972

Old technology: Millstones for grinding grain are seen at the Lacey Green Windmill, which is open every Sunday and Bank Holiday between May and September

Complex mechanisms: The machinery attached to the sails is pictured in the cap roof of the Lacey Green Windmill near Princes Risbourgh, Buckinghamshire

This work to restore the mill - which stands halfway between High Wycombe and Aylesbury - was led from 1971 by Christopher Wallis, who died in 2006.

He was the son of Sir Barnes Neville Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb used in the Second World War Dambusters raid in Ruhr, Germany, in 1943.

Mr Wallis Jr worked on more than 20 windmills and was a British Railways engineer in 1969 when he studied the mill and realised it could still be saved.

The first decade of the restoration in the 1970s was spent restoring the mill’s structure, before it could be pulled back to its proper shape.

Its eight walls were surrounded with plywood to strengthen the structure with supporting timbers either side. It was then given a layer of weatherboarding.

Four new sails were fitted, before the fantail was added - a mechanism to drive the gearing that ensures the main sails always face into the wind.

Rebuild: The windmill has milled some wheat into flour since it was restored to working order, but this is unlikely to repeated. It is pictured here being rebuilt in 1977

Maintenance: Lacey Green Windmill is pictured being repainted in 2008. The mill was rebuilt in the early 19th century to take advantage of technological improvements

Michael Hardy, 64, has been honorary 
secretary of the windmill's restoration committee since 1985, after 
moving to the area two years before.

He told MailOnline: ‘I’ve always been 
interested in historic buildings. I think all mills are interesting 
because they’re part of our heritage.

‘They
were really the first machines we had - predecessors to the Industrial 
Revolution. Historically this is the oldest smock mill in the country.

‘Its
wooden machinery dates to around 1650. It has a very unusual 
construction which dates it. Our main job now is to keep maintaining it.

He
added: ‘You can see in many ways how it was adapted and used modern 
technology to make it more efficient. It was in use until about 1915.

‘Then
it was actually used as a weekend cottage by someone in the 1920s. Then
in 1934 it was in a sad state. It was about to collapse.

‘The
Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and some local people 
realised the importance of the machinery and age, so they patched it 
up.’

The windmill has milled some wheat 
into flour since it was restored to working order, but this is unlikely 
to repeated as the structure is now so old.

It was rebuilt in the early 19th century to take advantage of 
technological improvements, such as adding a bolter to sift the flour.

Mr Hardy said: ‘People had seen it 
deteriorate from about 1950 and they saw something had to be done. From 
1971 to 1986, it took 15 years.

Wonderful structure: The Institution of Mechanical Engineers presented a heritage award to Lacey Green Windmill in honour of those who built and restored it

‘There was a lot of activity - purely volunteers worked every Sunday for the first 10 years, then every other Sunday. It is now restored to working order.

‘We had ground wheat a couple of times back in the 1980s, but we’ve now decided that it’s putting it under too much stress, so we now don’t.’

The mill, which was restored by members of The Chiltern Society, is open to the public every Sunday and Bank Holiday between May and September.

Just last month, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers presented a heritage award to Lacey Green Windmill in honour of those who built and restored it.

A commemorative plaque was received by Barbara Wallis, the widow of Mr Wallis Jr, who took it on behalf of the windmill's restoration committee.
