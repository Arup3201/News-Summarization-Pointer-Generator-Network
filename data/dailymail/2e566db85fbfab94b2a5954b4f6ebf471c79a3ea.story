Aaron Cruden will start at fly-half for New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday less than two months after a missed flight following a late night drinking session put his All Blacks career in serious jeopardy.

Cruden - who on Thursday admitted to feeling ‘nervous and apprehensive’ about his reintegration in to the squad - had established himself as first-choice All Black No 10 in the absence of the injured Dan Carter during the Rugby Championship.

But he was axed by head coach Steve Hansen for New Zealand’s final two games in Argentina and South Africa as pictures emerged of him drinking at a bar in Auckland the night before they were due to leave for Buenos Aires. 

Cruden missed the assembly time for the departure and Hansen announced he had been dropped on arrival in Argentina.

On Saturday, having been named in Hansen’s squad to tour England, Scotland and Wales, Cruden’s rehabilitation will be complete after he was chosen to start ahead of Beauden Barrett at Twickenham.

‘I wasn’t expecting it (to start) but when I got named I was really happy,’ Cruden, 25, said on Thursday. 

‘It’s pretty hard watching at home, the team you love playing for and the guys you love playing with.’

When asked if he was worried at any stage he wouldn’t get back in the side, Cruden admitted: ‘Yes, absolutely. You’d be silly not to and that certainly was the case.

‘That probably alludes to my point about not being expected to be named in the starting XV for this weekend. I guess you never know, putting yourself in a little bit of jip like that, what you could potentially lose.’

Cruden admitted: ‘I was pretty nervous and apprehensive coming back in after what I had done, as Shag (Hansen) has often said, it’s a little bit like a family and that’s exactly what we are here.

‘I know I stuffed up and I’ll be working hard over these next couple of weeks, and already since I’ve been back in the environment, to earn back the respect that I lost, not only to the people in this team but the rugby fans back home.

‘This weekend is the first opportunity to really do that and I’m really excited by it.’

Hansen used the same metaphor when discussing Cruden’s recall on Thursday. 

‘Our team is like a family,’ he said. ‘If one of the family members mucks up, you don’t stop loving them. You just don’t like what they did, the behaviour.

Team: I Dagg; B Smith, C Smith, S B Williams, J Savea; A Cruden, A Smith; W Crockett, D Coles, O Franks, B Retallick, S Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read.

Replacements: K Mealamu, B Franks, C Faumuina, P Tuiipulotu, L Messam, T J Perenara, B Barrett, R Crotty 

‘So you address the behaviour and then you carry on. And that’s what we’ve done.

‘He’s not being treated any differently and he’s not acting any differently - other than he’s ditched that behaviour. He’s in the leadership group and he’s leading well.

‘It’s not a matter of having a clean slate or a dirty slate it’s just a matter of being Aaron Cruden.’

Carter returned from a three-month injury lay-off to come off the bench against the United States on Saturday but this game comes too soon for the All Black icon.
