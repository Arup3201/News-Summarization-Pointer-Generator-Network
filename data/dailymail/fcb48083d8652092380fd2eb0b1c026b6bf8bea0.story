Senior Tory and Labour MPs last night called for a second Commons vote on military action in Syria despite polls showing most voters oppose British strikes.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond became the first senior Government figure to admit that MPs could be asked to return to the issue after they stunned David Cameron last week by refusing to support even the principle of a strike on Damascus.

Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have insisted there is no prospect of a second vote after Parliament made its will clear.

But senior Tories, including former Cabinet ministers Andrew Mitchell and Liam Fox, London Mayor Boris Johnson and former leader Lord Howard, insisted it was vital not to rule out another vote.

An ICM poll for the BBC found 71 per cent of people think MPs were right to reject military action, and that Mr Cameron handled the issue better than Labour leader Ed Miliband.

But Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French president Francoise Hollande accuse Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad of using chemical weapons on civilians.

However, Assad said Syria would hit back if it was attacked by France, adding: ‘There will be repercussions, negative ones obviously, on French interests.’

He also raised the threat of a ‘regional war’ if the West launched strikes, telling French newspaper Le Figaro: ‘The Middle East is a powder keg, and today the spark is getting closer. 

‘One must not talk only about the Syrian response, but also about what could happen after the first strike.

'No one can know what will happen. Everyone will lose control of the situation once the powder keg explodes. Chaos and extremism will spread. The risk exists of a regional war.’

Mr Hammond admitted last night that a second Commons vote could take place if circumstances changed ‘very significantly’.

Amid growing signs of Labour disarray over the stance taken last week by Ed Miliband – who is accused of indicating support for the Government only to pull the plug at the last minute – Shadow Cabinet ministers Jim Murphy and Chuka Umunna suggested a second vote may be needed.

Defence spokesman Mr Murphy said he was ‘uneasy’ at the stance of ‘indefinite inaction’ left by Thursday’s defeat at the hand of Labour and 30 Tory rebels. 

He added: ‘An attack on an ally  by Assad or further chemical atrocities would give the Prime Minister a right to bring this back to Parliament.’ Business spokesman Mr Umunna said: ‘We certainly didn’t rule out military action.’

Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said it was ‘nonsense’ for ministers to rule out military intervention in Syria in all circumstances, and Tessa Jowell, another former Cabinet minister, said there should ‘of course’ be a second vote on Syria ‘if circumstances change’.

However, Tory sources said there was no prospect of a second vote because Mr Cameron would have little option but to resign if he was defeated again on a matter of war.
