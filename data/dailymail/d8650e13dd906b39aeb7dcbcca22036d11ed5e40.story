Hurricane Sandy, the superstorm that swept across New York City a year ago, has some very young survivors.

It was no small feat when James Grifio and his staff ay the NYU Fertility Center managed to save embryos in incubators during a storm induced power outage. They also managed to salvage the eggs in the ovaries of 21 women.

James Grifio, director if the NYU Fertility Center, told ABC News  that seven lucky New Yorkers have babies known as 'Sandy Saves.' Another six women are expecting.

The Manhattan Clinic lost power shortly after Sandy struck. Even though a generator on top of the 8-story building kept the incubators running through the night, flooding in the basement cut off the incubators fuel supply at 8:15 the next morning.

Dedicated to his patients, Grifio picked up several staff members at 6 a.m. the morning after the storm and drove them to the clinic.

'Thankfully, there were so many people who worked together,' Grifo said of the heroic rescue mission. 'To be a part of that was just amazing.'

It took some valiant efforts from the fertility clinic staff to keep the fragile embryos from cooling. Grifio and his team managed to carry five gallon cans of diesel fuel up the 8-story building to fuel the generator.

'Our pregnancy rates stayed the same, as if the storm had never happened,'said Grifio.

Not only was Grifio able to save the embryos in incubators but he was able to continue the fertilization  process in women who needed daily injections to force their bodies into ovulating.

A shot of human gonadotropin frees the eggs for collection just 35 hours later and time is of the essence in collecting the fragile eggs.

One patient had her egg retrieval scheduled for 10 a.m. the morning after the storm. Grifio, who cared more about his patient than his business, took one woman to a clinic on Madison Avenue.

'I loaded her, her husband and their 1-year-old baby into my car,' said Grifo, recalling how he rushed the family to another clinic up an eerily-empty Madison Avenue. 'And she had a baby from that cycle!'

The Madison Avenue clinic was a 'fierce competitor' but Grifio knew that he would be unable to perform the procedure.

'The backup power protected the incubators, but we couldn't take the chance of doing an egg retrieval,' said Grifio.

'It's a testament to the people in New York who work in medicine,' he added. 'Some of our most vicious competitors offered assistance.'

Anything frozen in the clinic was not in danger, reports the Huffington Post. Grifio and his staff also managed to freeze the embryos in liquid nitrogen for 6 patients who were scheduled to have the embryos transferred later that week. Those patients had to wait a month--but no embryos were lost.

The generator has since been restarted and has worked ever since. Thanks to the kindness of other fertility clinics Grifio was able to continue performing egg retrievals. The New Hope Fertility Clinic in Columbus Circle lent Grifio space to conduct his delicate treatments.

Grifio received offers of help from around the country, he said, which points to the fact that, 'the people in this field understand that there is a patient at the end of this. Everybody is working together not to compromise patient cycles.'

The identity of the families who Grifio helped conceive children during Hurricane Sandy has not been released.
