A federal judge handed an Iranian-owned Fifth Avenue office building in New York to the government Monday.

Worth as much as $700million, 650 Fifth Avenue was seized by the government because the owners funnelled rent money to Iran, a judge ruled. The 36-story building sits on the corner of 52nd Street, in the middle of one of the city’s toniest neighborhoods.

Seized: 650 Fifth Avenue, a $700million office tower owned by an Iran-government affiliate, has been seized by the US government

This is believed to be ‘the largest real property forfeiture’ in the history of the US government, prosecutors told the New York Daily News. Proceeds from its sale will be given to the families of Iran-aided terror attack victims.

Handed down by Manhattan Federal Judge Katherine Forrest, the decision is subject to appeal, the Daily News noted, but the ruling came only days before a separate private lawsuit was to commence in an attempt to seize the building on behalf of those victims.

‘The court has found that, based on the incontrovertible record evidence,’ rent money was funneled to a state-run Iranian bank, making it ‘a front for the government of Iran.’

‘The assets at issue . . . are subject to forfeiture,’ Judge Forrest concluded.

A real estate appraiser told the Daily News the building was snared at just the right time.

‘This is the best time to sell, it’s 
such a hot market,’ the appraiser said, ‘[but] you know the government, 
they’ll drag their feet and probably miss their chance to make a 
boatload.’

Worth up to $2,000 a foot at 380,000, 
the building could potentially fetch just over $700million, according to
 the appraiser – making it comparable in value to the nearby General 
Motors building, the Daily News noted.

The federal government and a private group representing the families of victims of the 1993 Beirut Marine base bombing and the 9/11 terror attacks were moving to seize the building, both in an attempt to provide compensation to the victims and their families.

Owned by the Alavi Foundation, the successor to the Pahlavi Foundation – which built the building and has ties to the Iranian government, 650 Fifth Avenue was constructed in 1978, according to Emporis. It sits on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street just blocks from Central Park.

The US Attorney’s office in Manhattan is tops in the nation at seizing assets, according to the Daily News. With a total of $2.98billion in asset taken last year, it accounted for 68 per cent of government seizure activity nationwide, the paper noted.

A call placed MailOnline to the building's listed owner, the Alavi foundation, was not answered.
