This is the heartbreaking photo taken of a man weeping as he comforts his beloved dog through cage bars after he could not afford to have his pet released from the city pound.

Dave Thomas, from San Bernardino, California, was jailed for a few days for traffic violations on February 13 - leading to his dog Buzz Lightyear being impounded.

After Mr Thomas was released from prison, he could not afford to pay the $400 fees required to have his two-year-old pit bull mix released from its cage at the shelter.

Fortunately for Mr Thomas, 36, a photographer and animal lover Maria Sanchez was at the shelter at the same time. She snapped a picture of the man sitting on the ground and stroking the dog's paw through the metal bars and feeding him Cheetos.

She told ABC: 'He was pouring water into his dog's water bowl, his dog sat there and 
licked up the water for about a minute, he sat down next to him and 
started weeping.'

Ms Sanchez posted the photo to her Facebook page and appealed to the kindness of strangers.

Within days the money was raised thanks to well-wishers - but Ms Sanchez still had to track down Mr Thomas because he had not left his contact details with the shelter.

She posted fliers all over the local area and appealed for help online. The amount raised has now totaled more than $2,000.

He was finally tracked down by on Monday evening by the local station and a highly emotional and relieved Mr Thomas was told he would be reunited with his beloved Buzz the following day.
