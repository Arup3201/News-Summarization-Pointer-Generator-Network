Chantell Miller's newborn baby girl Ka'Leah died after doctors mistakenly inserted a feeding tube into her heart. Her twin brother Kaleem, pictured with his mother, is now two

A premature baby girl died after doctors mistakenly inserted a feeding tube into her heart, causing her to suffer a heart attack.

Chanell Miller, 31, gave birth to twins, a girl and a boy, at 28 weeks into her pregnancy.

The newborns were transferred to Newham University Hospital's neonatal unit, where they were being cared for by specialist teams.

But nine days after their birth, Miss Miller, from East London, was told her little girl had stopped breathing and died.

A post-mortem examination revealed the newborn, named Ka'Leah Noel, died when doctors incorrectly pierced her heart with a long line feeding tube.

Ka'Leah's twin brother, Kaleem Noel, survived and is now two-years-old.

An inquest earlier this month determined the feeding tube was wrongly inserted into the newborn's heart.

Bart's Health Trust who run the hospital, have since said that they have compiled a comprehensive action plan to improve training given to neonatal staff on the correct insertion of long lines, in a bid to avoid a similar tragedy.

Miss Miller said: 'I appreciate that lessons have been learned by the hospital, I hope this never happens again - no mother should go through what I went through.

'I have to deal with the fact that if it wasn't for a simple oversight, Ka'Leah would be with us now.

'Nothing will ever bring back my only baby daughter - her death will be with me for life.'

While pregnant, Miss Miller, who has five sons, was delighted to find out that she was to give birth to her first daughter.

But just 28 weeks into her pregnancy Miss Miller was rushed to hospital after suddenly going into labour.

Medics found her son was in the breech position, while her daughter was facing backwards, and rushed Miss Miller into the operating theatre to undergo an emergency Caesarean section.

Four hours later on May 7, 2012, both babies were born - but it was not until three days later that Miss Miller was able to see the twins.

Ka'Leah was the smaller of the two, weighing less than a kilogram.

They were both incubated and fed by a long line - a tube used to feed babies that do not yet have working intestines.

The twins, who were born at 28 weeks, were rushed to a specialist neonatal unit at Newham University in London where medics were caring for them. Pictured is Kaleem as a newborn

'They were little fighters,' said Miss Miller. 'Both were breathing on their own and doctors were positive they'd pull through.'

Nine
 days after the twins' traumatic birth Miss Miller, who was still 
staying in the hospital for treatment for an infection caused by the 
emergency Caesarean, was called to the neonatal ward.

Miss Miller said: 'I was nodding off in my hospital bed when a nurse told me I needed to get myself to their ward fast.

'When I got there, I found medics frantically working on Ka'Leah. A short while later, a doctor delivered the devastating bombshell - my daughter had stopped breathing and died. I went numb.'

A spokeswoman for Bart's Health 
Trust, which runs Newham University Hospital, said: 'Bart's Health NHS 
Trust are extremely sorry for the distress caused to the family as a 
result of the failings in care provided to Ka'Leah.

'We have apologised in writing to Miss Miller and extended our deepest sympathies on her very sad loss.

'The
 clinicians involved in Ka'Leah's care were in early contact with the 
coroner following her death and have co-operated at every stage with 
ongoing inquest proceedings.

'A full internal investigation into Ka'Leah's death was commissioned as soon as the post mortem results were available.

'As
 a result of this we have implemented a comprehensive action plan, 
including producing clear guidance on the safe insertion of long lines 
and improving the training of staff to ensure their correct 
positioning.'

Miss Miller demanded a post-mortem after she received conflicting reports about the cause of her daughter's death.

She
 said: 'My mum arrived at the hospital to support me but was astonished 
when a doctor explained that her granddaughter had suffered a heart 
attack.

'I'd been told Ka'Leah had stopped breathing, it didn't stack up.

'Desperate for answers, we pushed for a post mortem which revealed a doctor had pierced Ka'Leah's heart cavity with the long line.'

An inquest two weeks ago determined that the line was incorrectly inserted into Ka'Leah by a doctor in his first year of speciality training.

The misplaced line caused cardiac tamponade, a rare condition where fluid builds up around the heart.

It was found that this, coupled with Ka'Leah's prematurity, caused her death.

At the inquest at Walthamstow Coroner's Court on June 11, coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe recorded a narrative verdict saying she had no doubt that the line was incorrectly positioned.

Miss Miller said: 'The inquest showed that no senior doctor had picked up on the mistake for over five days.

'Negligence had cost me my only little girl.

'The hospital have since apologised but as far as I'm concerned it isn't enough.

'I'm so lucky to have Kaleem but some days he looks so much like his twin sister it breaks my heart.

'Even now, two years on, I'm terrified to let him sleep in case he doesn't wake up.

'I am pleased the hospital are trying to stop this from ever happening again but I'm not happy that nobody has been punished for their mistakes.

'Following the inquest this month, I have decided that I need some time to grieve before possibly taking further action.'
