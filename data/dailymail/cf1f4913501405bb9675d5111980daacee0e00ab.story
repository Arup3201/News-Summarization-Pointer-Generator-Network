A slim-fitting Egyptian cotton T-shirt in tomato red, chic under a nautical blazer or relaxed over jeans. Versatile, soft and beautifully made, you might guess it was from J.Crew, that American-to-the-core favourite of the preppy middle classes.

In fact, it is made by Sunspel, a British brand that has been making basics since 1860, and is now headed by hot young British designer JW Anderson (best known for catwalk creations loved by Alexa Chung and Pixie Geldof).

At £55 to J.Crew’s £29.50 (for a vintage-finish cotton T-shirt), it’s not quite designer prices, but it’s hardly High Street either — but then this isn’t Chinese tat produced by the billion, it’s from the Nottingham company that brought you James Bond’s classic polo shirts.

British beauties: As shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion, shopping for deals became a national pastime. However, high-quality British brands are making a come back. Pictured: Libby London dress, £190.

Now Sunspel is having an extraordinary revival: worn by The Rolling Stones on tour and explorers in the Arctic, opening stores in hip parts of London and popping up in New York, it is leading the charge to bring British craftsmanship back to our High Street.

A generation ago, the British High Street was just that: town centres filled with British-made fashion, providing skilled work and trustworthy quality.

But in the Eighties, the lure of cheap factories in China and beyond proved irresistible. Home-grown staff were laid off, machinery was sold to the East and factories closed.

Kate Hill, founder of MakeItBritish.co.uk, which collates information on products made in the UK, saw it all happen.

‘I worked as a buyer for 20 years, and saw my career change from sourcing everything from the UK to spending all my time in the Far East,’ she says. ‘I remember when we first bought from China, we thought they’d missed a zero off the price it was so cheap.’

As shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion, shopping for deals became a national pastime. We boasted about what a steal we’d bagged, and shopped  at Primark because we were clever, not because we couldn’t afford better. ‘People used to spend a month’s earnings on their coat, and it would last years,’ says Kate. ‘Now we’ve got coats at Primark for £40. That would be unheard of a couple of decades ago.’

But the tide is slowly turning and for an increasing number of shoppers, long-lasting quality, guilt-free ethics and a lower benefits bill (thanks to more British jobs) feel like  a better return on their investment than pretty rags that fall apart after four or five washes.

And a number of brands are happy to offer them the option. From big retailers such as Marks & Spencer and Topshop, who are starting to dip their toes back in British waters, to smaller companies, such as Sunspel, that have  doggedly pushed on for years.

While such quality doesn’t come cheap — simply because the labour costs here are higher than in the Far East — if you do want to invest in the best of British, here’s where to look . . .

Thanks to Britain’s tailoring heritage, suiting is generally a good buy — and not just at the high end. For basic but flattering shapes, quality fabrics and contemporary edge, look no further than Hotsquash (hot squash.com), based on innovative textiles that help regulate your body temperature. Its sexy ruched, knee-length dress (pictured, below left) is £95. For sophisticated tailoring in a pared-back palette, Libby London (libbylondon.com) hits the spot with its practical-but-pretty power-dressing: the Willow dress (main  picture), £190, comes in two dusty pinks and creates va-va-voom curves, and the pure silk shirts for £90 look graceful.

When it comes to evening wear, Paper London (paper london.com) has vivid, beautifully made silk pieces such as an emerald cocktail dress on sale at £225, or a Pucci-alike sweater dress for £175.While several High Street brands offer UK-made selections, from Jigsaw to John Lewis, more surprising is Topshop’s upmarket Unique collection. Highlights include silk jungle-print separates and a knee-length bamboo-print dress, £195, and a pale teal satin skirt at £95.In a not-dissimilar vein, tiny brand Colenimo (colenimo.com) uses exquisite fabrics, often British, to make classic-with-an-edge pieces such as a silk crepe-de-chine black dress with white collar  at £149, or a vintage lace jacket (above, left) at £119.

Quintessentially British: Katherine Hooker jacket, £530

It’s not just special buys — everyday items are made here, too. Welsh brand Hiut (hiutdenim.co.uk)  has boyfriend jeans for £125, while for a smarter look, Wizard Jeans (wizardjeans.com) has a bum-lifting midnight-blue bootcut for £95 or skinny jeans, £30. Wizard’s founder Sally Allen-Gerard, who brought her production back to the UK from China, describes the process as ‘a real uphill struggle . . . we take far less profit than normal, but we believe it’s the right thing to do’.And if you’re taken by the Anglophile aesthetic of Ralph Lauren, why not get the real deal — a hand-tailored hacking jacket (above) by Katherine Hooker (katherinehooker.com) at £530 or a high-necked tweed style at Maquien (maquiendesign.co.uk), £120.
