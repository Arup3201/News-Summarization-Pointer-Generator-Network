A mother living on an air force base in Alaska loves working out so much she's incorporated her two small daughters into her daily routine.

Lauren Rodgers, who goes at bottlesandbarbells on Instagram, says that the duties of motherhood don't stop her from exercising rather, her children inspire her to lead by healthy example.

Rodgers says on her Instagram that she once suffered from an eating disorder and that being a mother is one of the things that drives her to choose health over her illness.

'Being a mom is my main reason to be fit & healthy. I want my girls to have a good example in a world of obesity and eating disorders. I love seeing them try things that I do and ask to workout at ages 1 & 2. I love seeing them WANT to eat fruit & cottage cheese & veggies. Our kids are the next generation & if you want them to change the world, show them how,' writes Lauren Rodgers on her page.

Even though being a parent to a one and two-year-old old may seem like a handful, when you're using your daughter as a weight, working out is a little easier and can be an activity the whole family can enjoy.

Lauren Rodgers posts videos of her and her children on Instagram and in one hilarious clip, she's got one of her daughters on her front and the other as a weight from the back.

After popping into a perfectly formed handstand, Rodgers goes on to do some push-ups with one of her girls and can even clap in between sets.

Lauren, her husband Denver, and their two adorable daughters like to make fitness a family routine.

In one video, Lauren and her husband Denver lift their two girls on their shoulders.

It’s not just the little ones who are lifted, though. Denver proves his strength my bench-pressing his wife in addition to his young girls.

With each member of the family carrying each other's weight, they support one another in every endeavor.
