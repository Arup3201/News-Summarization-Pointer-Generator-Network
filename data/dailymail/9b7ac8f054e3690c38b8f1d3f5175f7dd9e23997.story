A Texas resident who enlisted to fight in the Vietnam War at 17 was not allowed to renew his driving license when the state's Department of Public Safety told him his citizenship was 'unknown.'

Jerry Sullivan, 57, took four forms of ID to his driving license office in Cedar Hill earlier this week, including his expired license, original Social Security card and veterans' identification.

But officials still told Sullivan that he didn't have the necessary paperwork. The disabled vet, who lives on a limited income, will now have to fork out $60 to his home state of Missouri to get a birth certificate, and beat the red tape.

Jerry Sullivan, a Vietnam veteran who enlisted at 17, was denied a driving license renewal as the DPS computer systems recorded his citizenship as 'unknown'

'It's very frustrating because, I mean, my license expired in August. Thank God my wife's isn't,' he told Fox 4.

Sullivan was born in Missouri, signed up for the US Army as a teenager, served in Vietnam and moved to the Lone Star State in 1989. 

Yet when he took his old Texas driving license, his Social Security number, a US military ID and a Veterans Affairs hospital ID card he wasn't allowed to renew.

The DPS computer system had no record of Sullivan's American citizenship. Officials said that all driver's license applicants must present either a birth certificate or passport, or have record of one on file.

Sullivan will now have to obtain a birth certificate from Missouri for $60.

Sullivan took his original Social Security card along to the driver's license office with three other types of ID, but officials wouldn't accept them as proof of citizenship

Fox asked local residents outside the DPS office what they thought of this case and many had sympathy for Sullivan's plight.  

'I think it's a pretty lousy deal actually having to prove that. It 
seems like they ought to have to prove he's not a citizen, the way I 
look at it,' said Ferell Holcom.

'I think Texas is wonderful in most ways, but there's a lot of hoops 
you have to jump through that seem a little overboard,' noted Melanie 
Alexander.
