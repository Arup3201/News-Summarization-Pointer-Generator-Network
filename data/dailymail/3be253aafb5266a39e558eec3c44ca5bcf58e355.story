The former teacher of a 19-year-old track star who killed herself because she could not deal with the pressures of college life is a step closer in his push for new  laws to help potentially suicidal students.

Edward Modica, 64, who taught Madison Holleran  in the fifth grade, launched an online petition for change after his former student jumped to her death from a parking garage in January 2014.

Madison, who was a popular and talented runner on the University of Pennsylvania's track team, had sought help for depression just weeks before her death in Spruce Street, Philadelphia.

In his petition, launched last March, Mr Modica urged universities to take action to prevent other undergraduates from killing themselves to escape the 'pressures of college expectations'.

'Rigorous demands': In his petition, launched last March, Mr Modica urged universities to take action to prevent other undergraduates from killing themselves to escape the 'pressures of college expectations'

He proposed the Madison Holleran Law, which has two provisions. Firstly, that colleges be required to 'publicly list the number suicides and attempted suicides on their campuses annually'.

Secondly, that colleges be ordered to have certified suicide prevention counselors 'to help potential victims, address their needs and allay their fears about the rigorous demands of college life.'

The petition, which stated that the freshman's death 'left a void in the hearts of so many people across the United States', quickly spread online. A year on, it has gained nearly 8,500 signatures.

And now, it is closer to influencing the passage of new state laws after Mr Modica, who taught Madison at Brookside School in Allendale, New Jersey, turned to a politically active friend. 

The retired teacher approached Pamela Philipp, who worked for many years in politics and helped push another law regarding fatal genetic diseases in children through the state legislature. 

He told her of Madison Holleran Law and the lives he believed it could save. Philipp offered to help, telling him that the proposal would likely be divided into two separate bills based on its provisions.

Final moments: The freshman posted this shot of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death

She then set up a meeting at the Wayne offices of Sen. Kevin O'Toole and Assemblyman Scott Rumana. The pair represent the 40th legislative district, including Madison's hometown of Allendale.

O'Toole and Rumana's office told NJ.com that the bills are currently being drafted. Philipp believes that the second of the two bills - relating to on-site counselors - will be an easier sell.

'As long as something is passed in her honor to help other young adults then I'm pleased,' Mr Modica told the news site, adding that Madison's grief-stricken family support his efforts.

According to the Suicide Prevention Center, about seven per cent of undergraduates in America seriously consider suicide as a way to escape their academic demands and other issues.  

'It seems, unfortunately, that suicides have become a regular occurrence on campuses,' Mr Modica, who also taught Madison's two sisters, told the New York Daily News last year. 

'This would allow parents to know what's going on and the parents could delve into those issues before school begins.' 

Madison's suicide last year rocked the UPenn community and sent shock waves through Allendale. Before her death, the teenager had told her parents she was seeing a therapist for depression.

'We knew she needed help,' her father, James Holleran, told the New York Post. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost confidence in academics and  in her track abilities.'

Speaking through tears, he added: 'There was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn. She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and stress.'

Although he and his wife Stacy had encouraged their daughter to stay home or transfer to a different college, the determined teen had insisted on staying at school, he said. 

On the day that Madison jumped to her death, her father texted her encouraging her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she would.

But just hours later, she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family on top of the parking garage before she jumped. She finished the note: 'I love you all... I'm sorry, I love you.' 

Madison's family have launched a foundation in her name to help prevent suicides. This year, they are also awarding a scholarship to students at her high school, Northern Highlands, in her name.
