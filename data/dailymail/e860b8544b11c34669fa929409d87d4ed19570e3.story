The woman who alerted police to  Jesse Matthew has spoken for the first time about the moment she came face-to-face with the man suspected of kidnapping student Hannah Graham.

Karen, who did not give her last name, was walking along a beach in Gilchrist, Texas on Wednesday afternoon when a man came speeding alongside her in his car.

She said that he slammed on his brakes and brought the car to a halt in the sand - and it was then she recognized him as the man suspected of abducting the missing University of Virginia student.

Karen, who did not give her last name, said that she was walking along a beach in Gilchrist, Texas when a man came speeding alongside her in a car and she recognized him instantly as Jesse Matthew

She told ABC13: 'He was very close and looked at me. It was very scary.

'At a glance, I think I resemble Hannah. And I know that's why he did a double take at me, I do. And I knew it was him.' 

Karen also recognized Matthew from his wanted poster which was issued after he fled Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday. 

Matthew was arrested at his blue tent on a Texas beach in Gilchrist on Wednesday at 3.30pm after Karen's tip-off.

A sheriff's deputy caught him following a massive manhunt by the FBI and police forces across the U.S. and he was taken into custody without incident. 

According to CNN, he was held at the scene on the Gilchrist beach for several hours and questioned.

It is unclear why Matthew was in Texas although several reports have suggested that he may have been trying to flee to Mexico. Galveston is roughly a nine-hour drive from the Mexico border. 

He was later caught on camera being led into Galveston County Jail surrounded by law enforcement at 8pm.

The 32-year-old was charged on Thursday with being a fugitive from justice and abduction on a Virginia warrant. He also faced a charge of giving false information to a police officer in Texas. 

He was denied bond on the federal abduction charge and his bond on the Galveston County charge was set at $1,500.

Investigators traveled to Texas to interview Matthew who is reportedly not talking. 

He appeared in court on Thursday where he complained that his clothes had been taken away from him and he had been made to sleep on a hard bed.

The 32-year-old, stood in green prison overalls with his hands cuffed in front of him at 8am on Thursday as he appeared, via video link, before Galveston County Judge Mark Henry in Texas.

He was charged with abduction in connection with missing UVA student Hannah Graham and waived his extradition to Virginia to stand trial and right to an attorney - but yet all Matthew seemed to be concerned with was his outfit.  

Karen was walking along with beach in Gilchrist, Texas when she came across fugitive kidnap suspect Jesse Matthew and raised the alarm on Wednesday 

The woman who spotted Jesse Matthew on a Texas beach said that she immediately recognized him from his wanted poster  

UVA student Hannah Graham, 18, was last seen in the early hours of September 13 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The last person seen with her was Jesse Matthew

After mumbling that he understood the charges against him and his rights, Matthew said: 'Oh sir, I had a question for you. Like, they took all of my clothes and they got me sleeping a [inaudible] thing. I don't feel like I'm... I should be able to have some kind of clothes.' 

An apparently unimpressed Judge Henry responded curtly: 'You appear to me to be dressed in a jumpsuit.'

Matthew responded: 'Well, once I get back they are going to take my jumpsuit off.'

The judge explained that he had to be cleared by medical which is why his jumpsuit would be removed but he then would be given the clothing back.  

Matthew appeared bewildered by the paperwork he was being asked to sign which included a fugitive warrant from Virginia which the judge explained for a second time. He was not asked to enter a plea.

With Matthew not talking and police having few updates in the search for the missing teenager at a press conference on Thursday, a new witness has come forward to offer details about the night she disappeared. 

According to the owner of the bar where was last seen, Miss Graham was so drunk she could barely walk.

Tempo Restaurant owner Brice Cunningham said on Thursday that the sophomore, 18, appeared to be incapacitated as she left the nightspot with Jesse Matthew on September 13.

Matthew had been drinking at the bar earlier that night before he encountered the 18-year-old  outside on Charlottesville's pedestrian Downtown Mall, Cunningham said.

Matthew then briefly re-entered the bar, ordered what credit card records suggest were two beers, and rejoined the teenager outside. The bar's door monitor told police they walked off with Matthew's arm around her for support, he said.

At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo returned the focus of the investigation to finding 18-year-old Hannah Graham.

He said that his officers were re-interviewing witnesses, canvassing for more surveillance footage and searching properties. 

The police department has had in the region of 1,600 tips but the chief could offer no more details on the whereabouts of Miss Graham. 

Chief Longo said: 'The more time that goes by, the more difficult this becomes for everyone but we won't lose hope until we have to.'

He was unable to offer further details on the Galveston investigation and and could say no more about the clothing that Charlottesville officers retrieved from Matthew's home because it would be 'prejudicial' to the suspect's trial. 

He confirmed that Matthew would return to the state of Virginia on Friday or Saturday in the company of state police.

Matthew had been on the run since Saturday just hours after he was named by MailOnline as the last person seen with the 18-year-old student on the night she disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia. 

MailOnline exclusively revealed on Thursday that Matthew was accused of rape when he studied at Liberty University.

Matthew was expelled in 2002 from the Christian university founded by Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Virginia, following the alleged sex attack on a female student but was not charged with any crime, former teammates said.

Lynchburg City Police investigated the rape allegation and Matthew was named as a suspect, MailOnline has been told. 

But the student was not arrested or charged, due to lack of evidence.

However his scholarship was withdrawn and he was thrown out of the university, his teammates told MailOnline. 

The reward for information leading to the location of Hannah Graham had increased to $100,000.
