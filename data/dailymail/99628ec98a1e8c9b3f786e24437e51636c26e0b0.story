The cost of sending a child to school has spiralled 27 per cent this year after a sharp rise in the price of uniforms and an increased demand for high-tech equipment.

Parents will be forced to spend an average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 according to research by Santander credit cards.

And the cost of daily essentials such as lunch, bus fares and school trips has also risen - by 13 per cent to £44.

Earn to learn: The cost of sending a child to school has rocketed by 27% to £224 since 2012

The cost of the basic necessities - uniform, sports gear, books, stationery and technology - was found to be £210.31 for children at community schools pay.

For children at Grammar schools the figure rose to £284.40, those at academies cost £242.59 and foundation or trust school pupils cost £276.20, the Daily Mirror reports.

One reason why the costs has risen so dramatically is that more children are wanting to take high-tech equipment such as iPads and other electronic equipment into class.

A recent study found that a typical schoolchild will carry a staggering £450 worth of stationary, books and gadgets in their bag.

Many youngsters are now using expensive high-tech equipment such as iPads in class

A typical satchel costing £19.70 now contains a smartphone worth £362.10s and school books valued at £40.80.

Parents also fork out £7.60 on food and drink, including a lunchbox, and spend £14 on stationary.

The research shows children carry a pair of headphones in their rucksack as well, worth £5.80.And parents spend £100.80 pounds on their children's school uniform - bringing the total to a mighty £550.80.

Matt Leeser, head of buying for communications technology at John Lewis, said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top 3 must-have school bag items for the last 50 years.

'But there's no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom.

'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years' time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today's digital natives grow up and become parents themselves.

'In the run up to back-to-school we're predicting we'll sell a computing device every two minutes during the two weeks over Bank Holiday.'

On a national level the Britons now spend £2.3billion kitting their children out for class with an additional £447 million paid out for transport, food and outings.

Department store John Lewis said children were more likely to want a tablet or e-reader than a geometry set.

It was expecting to sell a hi-tech device like an iPad every two minutes over the Bank Holiday.

Spokesman Matt Leeser said: 'There’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and the classroom.'
