Robin van Persie has rubbished claims that his knee problems prompted Manchester United to sign Radamel Falcao, and insists he is looking forward to working with the striker.

It was reported that manager Louis van Gaal was concerned about the Dutchman's fitness, so much so that he would have required surgery.

A lengthy lay off would somewhat vindicate Falcao's £6m loan deal arrival, but Van Persie has said that talk is 'complete nonsense' and he will fight for a place with the Colombian.

'I am impressed that people come pick up the imagination to invent something like that,' Van Persie told Fox Sports NL. 

'I do not know where it comes from and can say with my hand on my heart that I won't be in a hospital  to have the operation.'

Falcao will wear the No 9 shirt at Old Trafford after the club's sensational swoop for the Monaco frontman.

The 28-year-old will command wages of around £280,000-a-week, and his scoring record coupled with Wayne Rooney's appointment as captain suggested that Van Persie could struggle to find a place in the side.

But the former Arsenal striker says he welcomes the competition.

'I welcome his arrival, he makes us better. At a top club you should always go for the best, which also fits my philosophy. 

'Falcao must fight for his place, as I also have to. We must duke with Wayne Rooney and James Wilson to see who's playing.'

Van Persie missed the start of the season after being granted extended leave following the World Cup, but completed 60 minutes against Burnley at the weekend.
