Former bikie gang boss Toby Mitchell and Australian footy player Jake King have continued their association, despite the Australian Football League's clear stance against the friendship.

Mitchell, an ex-Bandidos enforcer, posted pictures on his social media account of the pair at a fight night last weekend at Melbourne Pavilion.

The two were also hanging out watching King's football club, the Richmond Tigers, play last month.

This follows former AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou's push for the Tigers forward to drop links with the notorious bikie who was ambushed and shot five times in 2011.

The duo were pictured at a fight night on June 21 at Hawthorn East which 7km from Melbourne's CBD. The event was promoted by Powerplay, which Mitchell - former champion kickboxer - was previously a director, reported the Herald Sun.

Mitchell, who recently avoided jail over a Melbourne strip club brawl in 2010, and his controversial friendship with King made headlines when the Richmond forward invited him to his club's dressing rooms in September last year.

Demetriou described as a 'pretty stupid' move at the time.

He said he was concerned people of certain backgrounds had the potential to 'infiltrate' the code.

King was warned after he brought Mitchell to his club's dressing rooms in 2013

'We know after the past 12 months, from our code's perspective, it's not what we want,' Demetriou said.

'I'm surprised given the level of awareness, the efforts we've gone to with each club, to explain the importance of this particular issue â€¦ in fact I think it's pretty stupid.'

Although the AFL and Richmond did not comment on the pair's recent outing, the club's CEO Brendon Gale said he was disappointed about their relationship.

'Jake's relationship with Toby Mitchell pre-dates his time at Richmond,' he said in a statement on the club's website last year.

'Certainly we'll have a discussion with him. These are instructive opportunities to remind all players of the risk involved.

'We've brought it to Jake's attention that he should think long and hard about those sorts of friendships and connections and associations.'

Mr Gale said King hasn't broken any rules.

'We provide advice and guidance but as adults we expect them to make their own decisions,' he said.

Mitchell also continues to promote his high life and his newly claimed tattoo parlour, City of Ink, through his Instagram account.
