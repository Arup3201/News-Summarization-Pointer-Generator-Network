The birth of a baby boy from a womb transplant could bring an end to the woes of women unable to have children naturally, doctors have said.

The world's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of the child in Gothenberg, Sweden, last month after years of tireless research.

His birth was only revealed by doctors yesterday as both he and his 36-year-old mother are in good health.  

And with British experts planning to carry out the procedure as early as next summer, a leading gynecologist has said the revolutionary surgery could become as popular as surrogacy among infertile women.

Mr Richard Smith, of the UK Womb Transplantation Team, celebrated the birth of a little boy in Gothenberg last night, congratulating the doctors who performed the pioneering operation nine months ago.

And the gynaecologist, who works at the West London Gynaecological Cancer Centre, Queen Charlotte's & Chelsea Hospital, said the surgery could become a possibility for British women as soon as next summer. 

'We're almost ready to go, we are applying for ethics committee approval in the next few weeks at a national level,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 

Mr Smith said the medical breakthrough in Sweden could bring about a new era of childbearing for women with fertility problems.  

'The great big unknown always was could a transplanted uterus carry a baby and have a successful live birth and that's why what's happened here is so exciting. 

'The great unknown is now answered which is that it is possible - it's the proof of purpose.' 

The doctor added the procedure could become as popular as surrogacy, which 'carries as many risks if not more'. 

'It would reduce the demand for surrogacy however there are still plenty of women who will prefer to go down that route and avoid major surgery. 

'But there are many, many women who would prefer to carry a baby themselves. There's also a bit of a legal minefield around surrogacy, and to avoid all of that and to have their own baby is incredible important (for some women).'

Unlike the Swedes' project, his team would harvest the wombs of cadaveric donors - patients whose hearts are still beating but they are brain dead. 

Doctors in Gothenberg used the wombs of six women for the transplants.

'Some of our research shows you can retrieve the uterus at the back end of the queue after all the vital organs, so that would be the source of those organs for women in the UK.    

'We hope, subject to funding, to get going next year - next summer.' 

Speaking of the 'breathtaking' birth of the baby in Sweden, one  doctor said that it was so emotional, it was like having her own child. 

The boy, who is in perfect health, was born to a 36-year-old  woman who had been born without a womb. She carried her baby in the womb of a 61-year-old woman.  

Last night, the Lancet medical journal released details about the remarkable birth. The little boy, whose arrival has remained secret until now, was born by Caesarean section a month ago.

Project leader Professor Mats Brannstrom, of Gothenburg University, said: ‘The baby screamed right away and has not required any other care than normal clinical observation at the neonatal unit.

‘The mother and child are both doing well and have returned home. The new parents are of course very happy and thankful.’

Liza Johannesson, a surgeon at Gothenburg University, who was present at the boy’s birth, said: ‘It was breathtaking. It was like having your own child.

'It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ Professor Brannstrom said: ‘There was fantastic happiness among me and the whole team. 

'But at the same time, the sensation was also a little unreal because we really couldn’t believe we had reached this moment.’

The baby is breastfeeding and growing well. His mother may decide to keep the new womb until she has a second child. Unlike other transplant organs, donor wombs are unlikely to remain in their recipients indefinitely.

The baby was born two months early after his mother developed pre-eclampsia – a life-threatening condition. 

He weighed just under 4lb and although this may seem small, it is normal for a baby so premature. 

It isn’t known why the woman’s pregnancy became complicated. It may have been due to the strong drugs she was given to stop her rejecting the new womb. Or due to her underlying health problems; she only has one kidney.

Another six women who took part in the groundbreaking project at Gothenburg University are pregnant – and their doctor says their chances of giving birth are good. The boy’s mother, who has not been named, was one of nine women to be given a new uterus.

In five cases, the donor was the woman's mother – meaning the same womb could carry two generations of the same family.

In this instance, the new womb came from an unrelated woman, a mother of two, who was long past the menopause.

Professor Brannstrom, who has spent more than a decade perfecting the complex gynaecological techniques needed, said: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility.’  

A woman’s own eggs are used in the procedure meaning the baby will be genetically her own. Critics of the procedure include fertility expert Lord Winston, who says the risks are too great and some women should accept they can’t bear children.

The world’s first womb transplant was in Saudi Arabia in 2000 but the woman’s body rejected the organ after four months.
