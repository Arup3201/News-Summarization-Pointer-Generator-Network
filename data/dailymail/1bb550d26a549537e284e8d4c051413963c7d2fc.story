Prize-winning author Hilary Mantel has courted controversy again by claiming the poor were treated better centuries ago than under David Cameron’s Government.

The historical writer said a ‘mood of harshness’ had taken over Britain and those in poverty were now portrayed as ‘morally defective’ by the Coalition.

The 62-year-old sparked outrage last year when she said the Duchess of Cambridge was a ‘plastic princess’ and ‘born to breed’.

She also recently attracted criticism after penning a short story about the IRA murdering Margaret Thatcher.

And in an interview to promote the German-language version of the story this week, she said the Tudors had more of an advanced view than Britain today on how the needy should be treated.

She said: ‘When people feel they’re being mistreated, they lash out against people who are weaker than themselves, immigrants for example. What’s happening here at the moment is really ugly.’

She told German newspaper Der Spiegel: ‘The government portrays poor and unfortunate people as being morally defective. This is a return to the thinking of the Victorians.

‘Even in the 16th century, Thomas Cromwell was trying to tell people that a thriving economy has casualties and that something must be done by the state for people out of work.

‘Even back then, you saw the tide turning against this idea that poverty was a moral weakness. Who could have predicted that it would come back into style?

‘It’s myth making on a grand scale, and it’s poisonous.’

Mantel, who was awarded the Man Booker Prize twice for Wolf Hall – an account of the rise of Henry VIII’s confident Thomas Cromwell – and its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies.

She said: ‘Many people are poorer than they were five or six years ago. The last few years of austerity after the banking crisis have opened up a wider gap between rich and poor.

‘What’s put to the electorate is: You can’t have this, you can’t have that, because there’s no money in the pot. But it’s not really a question of resources. It’s a question of ideology, which is moving to the right. It wishes to reduce the role of government and it strives for a small state.’

She also told the German paper that her comments on Kate Middleton had been taken out of context, and she said the Prime Minister’s criticism of her that followed was ‘unwise’.

She said: ‘He was misguided in being rushed into comment about something he knew nothing of.’

And she defended her recent short story on the murder of Mrs Thatcher – which prompted outrage and even calls for a police investigation from some quarters.

She said: ‘I was prepared, but bringing in the police for an investigation was beyond anything I could have planned or hoped for, because it immediately exposes them to ridicul.

‘These people don’t know how to read fiction, they were professionally outraged. I don’t know if the reactions would have been the same if a male writer like Martin Amis or Ian McEwan had published this.

‘I don’t need a defence, but what I would ask them is: Do you think Ms Thatcher shied away from controversy? Do you think she cared overly much about public opinion?

‘Thatcher was the first woman in Downing Street, but imitated a man. When I say this, it seems like a joke, but I think Margaret Thatcher had a great deal of trouble understanding and coming to terms with her own femininity.’

But Enfield North MP Nick de Bois dismissed the author’s 'extraordinary' claims as fiction.

The Tory said: ‘With more people working than ever before and unemployment lower than it was before the last election it beggars belief that Ms Mantel make this claim - like a Hollywood historian she doesn’t let the facts ruin her storyline.’
