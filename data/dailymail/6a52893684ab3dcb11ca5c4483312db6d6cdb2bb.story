Millions of last-minute Christmas shoppers flocked to the high street today in one of the busiest retail weekends of the year.

Panic Saturday saw cities across the country packed with bargain-hunters, many hoping to secure discounts of up to 75 per cent.

Over 15million people - around 31 per cent of the adult population - took to the shops today, spending an average of £196 each or £1.8m every minute.

'There's a sense of urgency because Christmas is coming and this is the last weekend. It's the first time many people who have been working can get to the shops. 

'There's also a sense they are looking to make their money go further. Historically, there are always promotions leading up to Christmas.

'This is the last weekend and I think shoppers want more for their money.

'The retailers are working hard to do that but they won't go into full sales until Boxing Day.'

 pigs in blankets, 68 million Brussels sprouts, 12 million Christmas

Playing the sales: Marks and Spencer, Gap and House of Fraser all had huge discounts today

Retailers
 will consider this weekend a last chance to turn their profits around 
after the British Retail Consortium showed a 3.4 per cent annual drop in 
footfall from September to November - the sharpest fall since August 
last year.

Retail sales
 were up 0.3 per cent in November, while in October they fell 0.9 per cent, the latest 
official figures from the sector show.

Experts said it means that unless
 a sharp rebound occurs in December, the fourth quarter will be 
relatively flat.

Shops have slashed prices to entice last minute bargain-hunters to make the most of the final shopping weekend before Christmas.

Debenhams,
 Mothercare, Gap, Argos and BHS are all slashing prices, while Marks 
& Spencer has launched a last-minute 'Mega Day' of 30 per cent 
clothing discounts.

Bargains: Many shops have slashed priced by 50 per cent to entice spending-savvy shoppers

Austin
 Reed is offering 25-60 per cent off all womenswear and House of Fraser 
made a 'gift of indulgence' with 50 per cent off selected lines.

Analyst Nick Bubb said the M&S discounts were likely to hurt the brand, irritating loyal customers who paid full price in recent weeks.

He said: 'Whether it will turn out to be worth doing that in short-term, just to try to save the CEO's job, remains to be seen, but the M&S brand will suffer long-term damage.'

According to some reports, one in four stores are refusing to discount for this reason.
