Smartphones and tablets have meant people can watch porn wherever and whenever they like.

Of the 38 million people who visit online site Pornhub each day, nearly half are now using mobile devices to view pornography.

And according to figures released by the Montreal-based site, Safari on the iPhone and iPad is used more than any other mobile browser to watch adult content.

Google Chrome is by far the most popular browser used by nearly 45 per cent of Pornhub viewers. Internet Explorer comes in second at 23 per cent, just slightly ahead of Firefox

Apple’s iPad was the most used tablet by quite some margin, the group said, with Safari claiming 73 per cent of the porn site’s tablet visitors.

Google’s Chrome, which is available on the iPad and Android tablets, came a distant second used by 13.6 per cent of visitors.

Despite this rise in mobile-viewing, the Montreal-based site has found that 51 per cent of people prefer using their old-fashioned desktop for adult content.

The least popular device for viewing porn on was the Blackberry tablet, which made up exactly 0.69 per cent of all tablet Pornhub consumers.

Mobile users spend less time on the site on average. Internet Explorer takes the longest at 8 minutes 57 seconds, and Chrome the least at only 8 minutes 17 seconds

America
 is in the grip of a pornography pandemic that has become so serious it 
should be treated the same way as teenage smoking or drink driving, 
activists have warned.

Porn
 sites get more visitors per month than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter 
combined, a third of all downloads contain porn and the internet now 
hosts 4.2 million porn websites.

Dawn
 Hawkins, executive director of Morality in Media said porn must be tackled no differently
 than any major public health crisis.

Speaking
 ahead of a two-day conference on sexual exploitation earlier this 
month, she said, if left untreated, addiction to pornography can leave 
users with psychological damage.

'There’s
 a lot of science now proving that pornography is harmful,' Hawkins said
 at the National Press Club in Washington.

Gizmodo asked Pornhub to dig a bit further into its data, and see what desktop web browsers are the most popular for watching porn.

The group found Google Chrome is the most favoured with nearly 45 per cent of 
viewers using the browser.

Internet Explorer comes in second
 at 23 per cent, just slightly ahead of Firefox.

‘Unbelievably we do still have daily visitors from Internet Explorer 5 looking for a porn fix,’ the website said.

Internet Explorer users spent the longest amount of time on the website, clocking in at a 10 minutes and 30 seconds for desktop users.

Mobile users spend less time on the site on average. Internet Explorer again takes the longest at 8 minutes 57 seconds, and Chrome the least at only 8 minutes 17 seconds.

On tablet computers, Amazon Silk users take an 12 minutes 33 seconds each time they visit Pornhub - two minutes longer than iPad users with Safari. Those using Android browser are fastest at 9 minutes 45 seconds.

A search for 'Kim Kardashian' pops up on all browsers but Safari, while fellow sex-tape alumni 'Farrah Abraham' is only loved by Internet Explorer users.

A separate study, conducted last month by the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, found that men who watch pornography may be shrinking their brains and dulling their responses to sexual stimulation.

It is the first time researchers have found a possible link between regular viewing of pornography and physical harm.

However, an alternative explanation is that people who spend more time looking at pornography are born with a certain type of brain.
