Eva Rausing died as a result of the dependant abuse of drugs

For eight weeks after the death  of drug-addicted millionairess Eva Rausing, her husband carried out a bizarre and desperate  charade to convince their servants  she was alive.

Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing banned staff from entering the couple's  squalid 'crack den' bedroom in their otherwise-immaculate £70million London mansion.

He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day. In fact he was covering her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes, blankets and plastic sealed with industrial tape before covering it in deodorant to mask the smell.

By the time police raided the 50-room house in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker. The full disturbing details of her death and its aftermath were revealed yesterday at Westminster Coroner's Court.

Hans Rausing, 49, one of Britain's richest men, was excused from attending the inquest as he continues to receive treatment for drug addiction and a mental breakdown. He was instead represented by  a phalanx of lawyers and public relations officials, led by the Prime Minister's older brother Alex  Cameron QC.

In a statement read to the court, Mr Rausing, an heir to his family's £4.3billion packaging fortune, said the couple's lives had plunged into addiction.

'We both felt that our lives were completely hopeless.'

Describing his wife's last moments, he said she slid from their bed with a thump. He found her lying sideways on the floor, her head resting on a pillow.

'I heard her exhale and then she did not move at all. I saw her alive for a few seconds. I went to her and grabbed her hands, and tried to pull her up – I shouted “Eva, Eva, Eva”. I turned her towards me and saw her eyes had dimmed. She had stopped breathing before I reached her. I knew she had died – I was absolutely certain she was dead.

'I sat with her for a period of time then covered her up with a blanket and duvet. I could not look at her. I could not cope with her dying.' The inquest was told Mr Rausing could not face the 'reality of her death' and had little memory of what happened before or afterwards.

Eight weeks later, on July 9, he was stopped while driving his red Bristol sports car erratically.

Hans Rausing said he sat with the body of his dead wife then covered her up with a blanket and duvet

Hans Rausing told staff that his wife - who lay dead in their home - had a fever and he was taking her temperature twice a day

PC Darren Reynolds discovered him 
'vacant and unsteady' with a warm crack pipe in the footwell between his
 legs. Cannabis and a white powder were also found.

The officer's suspicions were aroused 
further when he discovered a carrier bag full of unopened letters to Mrs
 Rausing in the boot.

He asked Mr Rausing where his wife was and his eyes 'welled up' before he claimed she was in California.

A team of officers discovered the 
lower floors of his home were beautifully kept but the three housemaids 
revealed they were banned from entering the second floor where the 
couple lived.

Police discovered it was strewn with 
rubbish, swarming with flies and Mr Rausing had barricaded the bedroom 
shut with furniture and tape. Inside the master bedroom the bed was 
covered with tarpaulin and TVs, including one huge 50in screen. Syringes
 and drug paraphernalia were nearby.

Describing the scene, PC Reynolds said
 he 'could only describe it as looking like a squat' and was immediately
 struck by the stench.

'My immediate thoughts were there was something, or someone, decomposing.

'There were items, TVs, all over the floor – it was overwhelming.'

Officers began removing layers from 
the mound of material before uncovering a 'head of blonde hair' and 
calling in the murder squad.

Mrs Rausing was still clutching her 
crack pipe. Her pacemaker had been fitted six years earlier during heart
 surgery to repair drug damage and revealed her heart rate shot up to 
six times its normal level in her final moments.

Experts said she died at around 7.20am on May 7 when her heartbeat leapt to 384 beats per minute. The typical rate was 65.

Post-mortem tests found traces of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines and no evidence that she had  been assaulted.

Mr Rausing was arrested on  suspicion 
of murder but was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a
 ten-month  suspended jail term.

The inquest heard police have been 
unable to discover who  supplied her the drugs and her  husband said she
 had 'her own sources'.

Hans Rausing's father and grandfather 
made billions from building up Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging company 
which saw off the  milk bottle.

He was brought up in Sweden and moved 
to England in 1982 before spending several years travelling in Asia, 
where he was first intro- duced to drugs.

Hans Kristian Rausing appearing in the dock at West London Magistrates Court, was convicted of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body

While in rehab he met Eva Kemeny, 
whose father Tom was a multi-millionaire executive with Pepsi-Cola, and 
they were married in 1992.

They were teetotal for several years until Eva drank a glass of champagne to celebrate the eve of the new Millennium.

Mr Rausing said they had a 'very close
 relationship' and 'loved each other very deeply' but relapsed into a 
sordid life of drug abuse, retreating to their bedroom as their 
addictions deepened.

In April, she travelled to Malibu to 
attend a rehab clinic for cocaine abuse but was thrown out after she was
 caught with a secret stash of valium pills.

The last time her housemaids saw her alive was when she returned on April 29.

Mr Rausing said her health began to decline and he noticed she was not taking care of herself.

Westminster Coroner's Court heard how the husband had failed to report the death of his wife and kept her body under duvets

He believed the battery on her pacemaker had failed and she did not bother returning to Harley Street to have it fixed.

Mr Rausing said he could not remember 
the exact date of her death, adding: 'By this time I had a morphine 
prescription for about four years.

'I don't have any coherent 
recollection of events leading up to her death. I do not know how long 
the body remained in our bedroom. I do not remember that Eva took any 
drugs that day or not.

'She may have smoked some cocaine, 
which would not have been unusual.' Explaining his actions, he added: 
'Following her death I did not act rationally.

'I tried to carry on as if her death had not happened – I could not face the fact she was dead.'

Over the following weeks, as Mr 
Rausing told his Filipina housemaids his wife was suffering a fever, 
they noticed he was taking up trays of food for only one and had begun 
sleeping on a sofa in the kitchen.

Detective Inspector Sharon Marman, who
 led the inquiry, said there was no evidence that Mr Rausing played a 
role in his wife's death. Deputy Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe recorded a
 verdict that Mrs Rausing died from the dependent use of drugs

She said the couple 'lived an 
extremely happy, normal and  sociable life, but tragically their 
addiction returned' after New  Year's Eve 1999.

The coroner said there was 'clear evidence' that Mrs Rausing was a long-term cocaine addict.

She added: 'Cocaine is quite toxic to 
the heart – it causes fibrosis in the heart tissue – which can lead to 
arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), and sudden death.'
