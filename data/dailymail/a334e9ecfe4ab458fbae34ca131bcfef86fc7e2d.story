'Then they integrate them into a firearm that isn't going to scare them and won't be a shock to shoot.

In the firing line: Anti-gun campaigners have criticised its location close to Disney World in Florida

Coffee time: Visitors can relax after a day's shooting and grab some refreshments at the Florida attraction

But anti-gun advocates say the extreme shooting range, located six miles away from Disney World, does not fit in with other family-friendly tourist attractions in Orlando.

John Webster, 21, from Tampa, Florida, USA visited the range with his two friends.

He said: 'My heart was pumping - I never fired a gun like that in my life.

'To feel so much power was just exhilarating - pulling the trigger and having your whole body shake, there's nothing like it.'
