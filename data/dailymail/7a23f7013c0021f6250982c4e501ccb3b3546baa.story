A 42-year-old Romanian driver was beginning a two-year jail sentence in France last night after British customs officials found 48 UK-bound Albanians inside his tanker lorry.

The migrants were attempting to sneak into Britain via the Channel Tunnel but were arrested after a search of the vehicle just before midnight on Tuesday by British border police based at Coquelles.

The driver told a judge at a Boulogne court that his boss had ordered him to transport the Albanians to the UK. They were loaded into the truck at a motorway rest area less than an hour from Calais.

The lorry was confiscated and the driver banned from the North region of France for three years.

Gangs of Albanian people smugglers based at Channel ferry ports in France are known to be major players in the lucrative business of smuggling poor migrants to the UK.

On Monday, a Spanish truck driver aged 49 and two Albanian smugglers in their 20s appeared in court after five Albanians were found shivering in the back of a refrigerated trailer carrying 17 tons of broccoli. The lorry was about to board a ferry to Portsmouth from the port of Ouistreham.

At the hearing the driver told the judge that he had been tempted by an offer of €1000 (£830) per migrant payable on arrival at Portsmouth.

He claimed that it was the first time he had carried illegal immigrants but police records showed he had been previously arrested last June at Calais after migrants were found in his lorry.

The two people smugglers claimed that they too were ordinary migrants and were intent on starting a new life in Britain.

But the judge reminded them that they had been arrested together with the driver outside the lorry.

'You didn't hesitate to let the five Albanians travel in a trailer at a temperature of between 0 and 3C’, the judge told them.

Judge

The prosecutor asked the judge to impose 12-month jail sentences on the defendants, saying they had exploited human misery and poor people's hopes for a better life with no regard for their safety.

Last autumn deputy mayor at the port of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, called UK immigration policy 'obnoxious and hypocritical' - blaming Britain for attracting migrants and making the port a bottleneck gateway to the UK.

Mr Mignonet, who is also the port's immigration chief, revealed in an interview with the Daily Telegraph last month that '40 migrants a day or up to 15,000 a year' manage to evade border controls and sneak over to the UK through Calais.

Mr Mignonet called for border controls to be transferred from Calais to Dover, to deal with what is a 'British problem'.

French Interior Minister Valls has called on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to visit Calais to 'see for herself ' the chaos there caused by migrants desperate to stow away on ferries to Britain.

Calais became a magnet for UK-bound refugees in the mid-90s following the war in Kosovo. A huge Red Cross refuge at Sangatte was closed in 2002 on the orders of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy after pressure from Britain.

Homeless Afghan and Iraqi migrants began camping out in what was dubbed 'The Jungle' - a massive squat camp near the ferry terminal.

The Jungle was razed in 2009 again on the orders of Mr Sarkozy after a Canadian journalist was raped.

Since then migrants have camped out in sand dunes, Second World War German bunkers and open air squats in Calais. Currently, their numbers are estimated at more than 500.
