A killer with a 'hair fetish' convicted of murdering a British mother-of-two and a schoolgirl could now be linked to the murder of a student.

The Criminal Case Review Commission is 
looking into whether deranged Danilo Restivo killed foreign language 
student Jong-Ok Shin 10 years ago.

Miss Shin, 26, was knifed to death in Bournemouth, Dorset, in July 2002, as she walked home to her lodgings from a night out.

Local drug addict Omar Benguit was 
jailed for life for her murder in 2005. He has always maintained his 
innocence and doubts have been cast over how safe his conviction is.

It appeared even more unsafe after 
Restivo, 39, was found guilty last June of murdering 48-year-old Heather
 Barnett in Bournemouth and jailed for life.

Dental technician Restivo moved to 
Bournemouth in March 2002 and he beat and stabbed Miss Barnett to death 
in her own home in November that year.

The murder came nine years after the 
Italian national killed 16-year-old Elisa Claps in another knife attack 
in the loft space of a church in his home town of Potenza, Italy.

Her body was only found in 2010 and Restivo was convicted and jailed for 30 years for the murder last November.

In both cases, Restivo snipped locks of hair from both victims' bodies.

The scene of Miss Barnett's brutal and ritualistic killing was just three streets away from the scene of Miss Shin's murder.

According to some law experts, the 
chances of different killers striking four months apart and such a close
 proximity to one another are very remote.

Benguit's legal team has been lobbying the CCRC to look into the possibility that Restivo killed Miss Shin.

It is thought the commission has been 
in contact with Interpol with a number of questions in relation to the 
Miss Clap's Italian investigation involving of Restivo.

Once it has concluded its 
investigations, the commission will make a decision as to whether 
Benguit's case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for a full 
appeal hearing.

Des Jensen, who is part of Benguit's legal team, said: 'We are confident it will be sent to the Court of Appeal.'

Benguit's sister Amy Benguit said:
 'Everything is in the CCRC's hands and we have got to be patient 
because they have got to carry out their own investigation.

'Omar is feeling very positive. He 
will never ever say he did something if he didn't. He said he would 
rather come out in a coffin than admit to something he didn't do.

'I know he will be handed leave to 
appeal. A lot of mistakes were made along the way. I don't really want 
to blame anyone - all we want is justice for Omar and Oki.'

Barry Loveday, a reader of criminal justice studies at Portsmouth University, has spent months investigating Miss Shin's murder.

He said: 'There are similarities in 
Oki Shin's killing and Danilo Restivo's modus operandi, like the use of a
 very long bladed knife.

'The likelihood of two killers 
wandering around with similar knives three streets apart in Charminster 
at about the same time is very, very small.

'The likelihood of two murders by two individuals three streets and four months apart is frankly unbelievable.

'One must conclude that one can probably link up the murder of Oki Shin to Danilo Restivo as well.'

Restivo arrived in Britain in 
March 2002 and was placed under intense surveillance since he became a 
suspect in Miss Barnett's murder soon after her death.

When previously asked whether 
Restivo was responsible for any other killings, Detective Superintendent
 Stuart Cooper said: 'As far as we're aware there are no other victims -
 we're not actively looking for or concerned about anyone else.

'Restivo arrived in Britain in March 
2002, Heather was killed in November and we've been watching him 
carefully since then - it's a relatively short window of time.

'I don't think you can ever be totally
 sure but without any credible evidence to say there are further 
suspicions it's difficult to say.'

Asked whether Dorset police would 
be re-opening the Oki Shin murder, a spokesman said: 'Omar Benguit was 
convicted of Oki Shin's murder. He lodged and appeal and that was 
dismissed.

'We understand that following an application on behalf of Mr Benguit to the CCRC a review is being conducted.'
