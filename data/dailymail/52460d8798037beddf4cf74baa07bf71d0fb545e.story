All frontline officers in the country's biggest police force will routinely use body-worn cameras within the next two years.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe announced that 16,000 uniformed patrolling officers will be given the devices by March 2016 at an estimated cost of £9 million.

The cameras are being introduced in the wake of the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, whose death at the hands of a police marksman sparked a wave of unrest that spread across the country.

A small team of firearms officers has also been trialling the cameras for just over a week but they cannot yet be used by undercover teams, and so would not have been deployed in the operation that led to Mr Duggan's death.

Sir Bernard said: 'It's important for policing to be transparent. I would argue that this is going to be as significant a development as the involvement of lawyers, tape recorders and CCTV in detention areas and cells.'

The cameras are already being trialled in 10 boroughs across London and on August 7 pencil cameras were given for the first time to a uniformed armed unit, the Trojan Proactive Unit.

It is a centrally-controlled, 14-member squad which sends out armed teams in BMW X5s, particularly to high-crime areas. They have already been used to record a confrontation with a man brandishing an iron bar.

Police marksmen in south Wales will also start testing the devices next month.

Strategic firearms commander Superintendent Ian Hackett said: 'The vast majority of firearms officers are very positive about this. They see it as long overdue, they've got nothing to hide.

'They want the public to see how they operate and to see the pressure that officers are under, and the split-second decision making.'

A former Scotland Yard marksman identified only as E7 has been charged with murder for shooting robbery suspect Azelle Rodney in an operation that was only filmed because one of the team decided to bring a camera.

Two fellow firearms officers have resigned from their marksman roles in the wake of the charging decision.

It is planned that the armed teams will not be allowed to view the footage they have captured until after they have given a full statement about a shooting, which includes a vital account of why they felt force was justified.

Cameras are already being rolled out in new police vans, which are replaced every two to three years.
