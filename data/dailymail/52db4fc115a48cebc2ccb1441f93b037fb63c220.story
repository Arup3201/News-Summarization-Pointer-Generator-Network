Russia is at war with Ukraine and so effectively at war with Europe, Lithuania's president claimed today as European leaders threatened to impose further sanctions on Vladimir Putin.

The dramatic comments from Dalia Grybauskaite come after officials in Kiev accused Moscow of using tanks to 'flatten' the border town of Novosvitlivka.

During an EU summit in Brussels today, David Cameron said it was vital to address the 'unacceptable' situation of having Russian troops on Ukrainian soil.

The Prime Minister has insisted there must be 'consequences' if an estimated 1,000 Russian troops are not withdrawn from the east of the country.

Ahead of the meeting, Grybauskate told reporters: 'It
 is the fact that Russia is in a war state against Ukraine. That means 
it is in a state of war against a country which would like to be closely
 integrated with the EU. Practically Russia is in a state of war against
 Europe.

'That
 means we need to help Ukraine to ... defend its territory and its 
people and to help militarily, especially with the military materials to
 help Ukraine to defend itself because today Ukraine is fighting a war 
on behalf of all Europe,' the leader of the former Soviet state said.

She
 added that an arms embargo on Russia should be stepped up by including a
 halt to sales under existing contracts - a swipe notably at France, 
which has resisted calls to cancel a deal to sell Moscow a strategic new
 warship.

Outgoing
 European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the situation 
was in danger of reaching 'the point of no return'.

Ukrainian government forces have succumbed to a sequence of military failures and seen their holdings in the conflict-ridden east shrink in recent days as Russian-backed rebels continue their fast-paced offensive

The sanctions were discussed after Nato released images apparently showing Russian forces and an array of heavy weaponry in Ukraine.

However,
 Mr Putin has denied that his forces are in Ukraine - and upped his own 
rhetoric by reminding critics that Russia has nuclear weapons.

Following the attack on Novosvitlivka, Ukraine military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told journalists in Kiev Russian tanks had and fired on every house in the community.

'We have information that virtually every house has been destroyed,' Lysenko said.

There were also accusations that Ukrainian fighter jet was been shot down by a
 Russian  missile during combat against the rebels.

A
 brief statement posted on the Facebook page for the so-called operation
 against separatists said the Su-25 was hit yesterday, and that the 
pilot ejected and was uninjured. 

It said the plane was hit by a missile from a Russian launcher, but did not give more detail.

Mr 
Cameron, who earlier held talks with Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko 
at a nearby hotel, said: 'We have to address the completely unacceptable
 situation of having Russian troops on Ukraine soil.

'Consequences must follow if that situation continues and we will be discussing that as well today.'

Today, pro-Russian rebels were spotted watching as Ukrainian troops were evacuated from Starobesheve in eastern Ukraine. And yesterday, Ukrainian forces showed off a cache of weapons that they had seized from Russian forces

In addition to denying that its forces are in Ukraine, Russia consistently rejecting allegations that it is supplying the rebels. Until this week, the fighting had been concentrated well inland.

But rebels have taken control of the 
town of Novoazovsk with the apparent aim of pushing further west along 
the coast which connects Russia to the Russia-annexed Crimean Peninsula.

The expansion of the four-month-old conflict raised strong calls by the West for Russia to back off its involvement in Ukraine.

Several
 European Union foreign ministers yesterday accused Russia of invading 
eastern Ukraine and said Moscow should be punished with additional 
economic sanctions.

'We
 see regular Russian army units operating offensively on the Ukrainian 
territory against the Ukrainian army,' said Swedish foreign minister 
Carl Bildt. 'We must call a spade a spade.'

Fighting 
between Ukrainian military forces and Russian-backed separatists in 
eastern Ukraine has already claimed at least 2,200 lives, according to 
UN figures.

European
 Union leaders are today poised to slap additional sanctions on Russia 
because of what they condemn as a continued destabilization of Ukraine 
and a deepening military involvement by Moscow.

The
 28-nation bloc's heads of state and government on Saturday were also 
set to discuss possible further assistance for Ukraine as the country's 
president, Petro Poroshenko, was expected to brief the leaders in 
Brussels on the situation.

Additional
 EU sanctions would aim at inflicting more economic pain in hopes of 
changing what is viewed as Russian meddling in Ukraine.
