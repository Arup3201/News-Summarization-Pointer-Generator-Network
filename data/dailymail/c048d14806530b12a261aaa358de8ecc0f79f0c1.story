He may have been wanting to phone home, but nerds from the 1980s are still obsessed about the thought there may be hundreds of Atari Computer games buried in a New Mexico landfill.

After decades of rumors, digging will finally begin this weekend in a New Mexico landfill for an apparent stash of what some call 'the worst video game ever.'

The dig at the Alamogordo landfill is where the computer company Atari reportedly discarded millions of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial game cartridges in 1983 and will start excavating on Saturday morning along with officials from Microsoft-owned Xbox.

Get digging! Gamers will finally know the truth behind the gaming legend of whether or not Atari buried millions of video games cartridges of the epic flop E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial in a New Mexico landfill in 1983

Fail! The game was one of the worst commercially released games ever made and is often blamed for the game industry crash of 1983

After the success of the Steven Spielberg film Atari snatched up the rights for an astronomical $22 million to release a game.

The game was produced in just five weeks and was one of, if not the worst commercially released games ever made.

Despite being a complete flop, it was still one of the Atari 2600's best selling game.

Two million copies were sold before anyone realised how bad it was. It left another three million copies left unsold.

Looking for E.T.:Crews begin digging at the old Alamogordo, New Mexico to search for copies of the Atari game"E.T. The Extraterrestrial purportedly buried there in the 1980s

The excavation will be open for public viewing. The company is joining with Fuel Entertainment and LightBox Interactive to search the landfill.

All three companies are making a documentary about the project. Microsoft plans to release the documentary on its Xbox One console.

If anything is recovered, the  city would have the rights to any discovered games.

City Attorney Stephen Thies said any game cartridges will be stored by the city for possible marketing.

However, a tentative agreement between the Alamogordo City Commission and Fuel Entertainment's parent company calls for Fuel to receive some games.

The city will give Fuel either 100 game cartridges or 10 percent, depending on which is the lesser amount.

The company plans to hand out the cartridges to film crews.

A roaring success: The video game was based on the wildly popular 1982 Steven Spielberg movie about a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial who is mistakenly left behind on Earth

One for the trash! This game console is playing E.T., which is widely considered one of the worst games of all time. The game was so bad, and the business plan so badly thought-out, that it nearly destroyed the entire game industry

All three companies gained approval last month from the New Mexico Environmental Department for their waste excavation plan.

The agency plans to send a representative to monitor the project once it commences.

Atari paid director Steven Spielberg tens of millions of dollars to license the wildly popular 1982 movie's name, and game developers completed the project in just six weeks.

In the game, the player takes on the role of the titular alien and tries to elude FBI agents while collecting pieces of a telephone to call E.T.'s spaceship.

The end result was a huge commercial dud that caused the troubled company's worth to sink even further.

Atari purportedly disposed of millions of game cartridges and other equipment by the truckload at the landfill.

The area's supposed role as a gaming burial ground has taken on urban-legend status over the years.

The landfill was first used as a dumping ground in the 1920s but has been closed since the late 1980s, officials said.
