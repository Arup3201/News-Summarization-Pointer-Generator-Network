Motorists spend small fortunes purchasing the world's most luxurious cars, but it seems they are also forking out thousands for scrap metal.

Automotive fixer-uppers, known as 'barn finds', are becoming increasingly sought after, even though some are not in driving condition.

These rusting vehicles are the latest in a
 growing number of unrestored classics which have been selling for 
enormous prices around the world, despite needing thousands spent to restore them.

Its new owner will now have to spend thousands fixing it up, even though they could have bought a concourse quality model at the same auction for £850,000.
