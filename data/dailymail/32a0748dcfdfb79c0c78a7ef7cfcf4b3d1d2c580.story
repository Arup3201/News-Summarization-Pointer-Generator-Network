Lewis Hamilton sat down for contract talks with Mercedes on Sunday – 70 days after winning the world title.

In blue-sky Jerez on the first-day of pre-season testing, Hamilton talked through his future with Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes motorsport, and Niki Lauda, the chairman.

Both sides spoke of striking a new deal – worth about £60million over three years – as a formality. Hamilton was effusive, saying: ‘We have talked. We can come to agreement. We want to stay together. We love each other, basically.’

Hamilton, who is in the final year of his Mercedes contract, will partner Rosberg once more in 2015 

Lauda said: ‘There is no problem with the contract. He wants to sign it. We want him to sign it. There is no rush. We just need to find a time to do it, and then all the speculation can go away.’

Logic says staying at Mercedes is the sensible option: they are the super-team of the moment.

But Ferrari could yet intervene. Not only does the brand hold the greatest allure, not least to a driver whose avowed intent is to be ‘a legend’, but chairman Sergio Marchionne is an avid Hamilton fan.

They could also potentially offer him more money than Mercedes, whose budget could be restricted by their board in Stuttgart.

According to one contact there has already been contact between Ferrari and Hamilton. However, a reliable source close to Hamilton denies this is the case.

Either way, there could be a space at Ferrari next season if they release Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract expires at the end of the year.

So why the delay? ‘We left it until the end of last year, but then we didn’t see one another,’ said Hamilton, who takes over driving duties from team-mate Nico Rosberg on Monday. 

‘I’m still under contract this year, so we have time. It’s not something I have to rush to satisfy anyone else.’

Hamilton confirmed that Alonso, now of McLaren, rang Mercedes about joining them last year

Mercedes’ strength heading into the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 15, was underlined by Rosberg doing a massive 157 laps.

His high mileage was in contrast to the McLaren-Honda of Fernando Alonso, who, as Hamilton confirmed, rang Mercedes about joining them last year. He did six laps.

The Spaniard was the star attraction for a large home crowd who hung around the paddock. But, with McLaren coming to terms with their new engine, there is plenty of road for them to travel.
