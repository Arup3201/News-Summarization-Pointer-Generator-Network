Despite being told that he is free to leave, Manchester United keeper Anders Lindegaard appeared to make a point that he wants to stay at the club.

The reserve stopper posted an artistic Instagram picture of himself standing in the Old Trafford tunnel looking towards the sky with a caption reading: 'Follow the light #Loyalty #manchesterunited #mufc #oldtrafford'.

The Denmark international was signed from Norwegian club Aalesunds FK in 2010 but has failed to seriously challenge David de Gea for the No 1 jersey - and is yet to start a game in any competition this season.

With new manager Louis van Gaal keen on bringing former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes to the club, Lindegaard's days in Manchester appear numbered.

Valdes has been training with United's first team as he recovers from a long-term knee injury and could complete a move as a free agent within weeks. 

The 32-year-old was originally on the verge of a deal with United's north-west rivals Liverpool, but had a pick of clubs including Bayern Munich before choosing the Red Devils.

With Lindegaard not inspiring Van Gaal's confidence, the Dutch boss believes Valdes' experience would make him an excellent deputy for De Gea.

Meanwhile, Lindegaard was revealed as the only one of 18 United players who chose not to watch Real Madrid's recent 3-1 El Clasico win against Barcelona.

'We went to the Lowry, we had a screen so I could watch the second half and 17 players of 18 were there,' Van Gaal explained. 'I have never experienced that before. We have a lot of Spaniards!

'I won’t tell you which one wasn’t there.'

However, Sportsmail understands the Danish goalkeeper  was the player who chose not to join his team-mates.
