CSI has taken a step closer to reality as rapid DNA testing that could identify killers in hours has been revealed.

The method reduces the time taken to identify suspects at a crime scene from days, preventing suspects going on the run or committing another offense before they are apprehended.

Rapid DNA, in tandem with innovative fingerprint technology, is being heralded as a significant revolution in crime scene investigations.

The UK Home Office has invested £431,000 ($732,000) in development of 'Rapid DNA' as part of the Police Innovation Fund. Through the endeavour they are hoping to improve the accuracy and speed of identifying suspects at a crime scene, and prevent instances of false identification

A technlogy being developed by Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is offering more complete identification of criminals.

Their microscopic technology is called 
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging 
(MALDI-MSI) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in 
fingerprints.

It has been developed by researchers at SHU’s Biomedical Research Centre (BMRC).

The technology uses MALDI-MSI to produce multiple images of fingermarks.

This can reveal tiny changes in shape, and reveal particles and other elements hidden within the ridges.

These
 details can be important background information in a criminal 
investigation, especially if the suspect's fingerprint is not on the 
police database and a positive ID cannot be made.

According to The Times, £431,000 ($732,000) has been given by the Home Office to the Police Innovation Fund to forces in Lancashire and Nottingham-shire to introduce faster DNA procedures.

So-called Rapid DNA is a process through which DNA profiles can be returned in two hours or less.

It is believed to be an important breakthrough for crime scene investigations that could prevent criminals repeat-offending before they are caught.

Earlier this year the first application of Rapid DNA took place in Florida using a system known as RapidHIT 200, which can identify suspects in under 90 minutes.

Developed by IntegenX in the US and Key Forensic Services in the UK, it can match swabs taken from a crime scene against a national DNA database and produce a match quickly.

The portable device, which looks a bit like a printer, can take DNA and produce the result much quicker than modern DNA systems.

Most importantly, the device does not require any specific specialist knowledge to be used.

All it requires is that someone input a sample of DNA, and it will then cross-reference the sample with the DNA database.

It takes about three minutes for a user to input the a swab into the system and begin the analysis.

Results on DNA matches will then be produced in less than two hours - and the device can even process seven samples simultaneously.

Another system being introduced in the UK is being developed by Sheffield Hallam University and involves in-depth analysis of fingerprints.

The technology is known as Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI).

In trials with West Yorkshire police researchers have been taking marks from crime scenes and taking them back to the University’s laboratories for study.

From even just partial prints the scientists can find out the complete background of a criminal including their gender and drug use habits.

MALDI-MSI, which is a powerful technology normally used to map different molecules within tissue sections, produces multiple images of fingermarks which are made up of materials from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions.

Conventionally, fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted after using a powder to enhance them, and are then compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect.

The research team also discovered that the cooking spice, turmeric can be used as the powder to lift fingermarks within the MALDI-MSI process.
