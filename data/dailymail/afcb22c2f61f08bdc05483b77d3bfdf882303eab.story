The seamstress who survived for 17 days in the rubble of a collapsed garment factory building in Bangladesh left hospital yesterday and announced: 'I've got a wonderful new job!'

Reshma Begum had vowed never again to work in a garment factory after she was rescued from the wreckage of the eight-storey Rana Plaza building, where 1,129 people were killed in April in the clothing industry's worst disaster.

The 19-year-old, who became an international heroine when she 
managed to escape death and survived for more than two weeks on small 
scraps of food and water leaking from a pipe, has accepted a job at the Westin Hotel in Dhaka.

Pictures of Miss Begum's dramatic rescue were beamed around the world last month

'I feel great now,' Miss Begum said at a ceremony held in her honour at the military facility which has been caring for her since May 10.

'I'm recovered mentally and physically.'

But she said that she still suffered nightmares about her ordeal as she cried out for help from the wreckage of the collapsed building, despite the intensive care she had received.

'I still get frightened in the night. Whenever I think of those days I feel bad and frightened.

'I've forgotten most of what I did under the rubble.'

Miss Begum was lucky not to have been crushed later by a large concrete slab which had crashed into place just above her following the building's collapse.

Workers had all but given up hope of finding anyone alive after 17 days but heard her cries seconds before they were due to smash the concrete with heavy machinery, which would have brought the chunks falling down on her.

Miss Begum spoke briefly to the media after being released from hospital and said she was fully recovered from her injuries

The teenager, from a remote village in the western district of Dinajpur, had started her Â£38-a-month job at the garment factory only three weeks before the building collapsed.

'I never thought I would get my life back again when I was trapped under the rubble,' she said in her first interview since being released from hospital.

After her astonishing rescue made headlines around the world, job offers poured in from hotels and charities.

Asim Shah, general manager of the Westin Hotel, said: 'We're sure this young girl will be exceptional in her new job. We have made her an ambassador in the house-cleaning department.'

Miss Begum vowed never to work in a garment factory again following her ordeal

Authorities at the military hospital where Miss Begum was treated said she was fully recovered from the head injury she suffered in the collapse.

The garment-manufacturing industry, which produces high street clothes for stores around the world, promised to clean up its act after the disaster.

But hundreds of employees working in a factory making sweaters for Western brands fell ill this week after drinking suspected contaminated water in their workplace.
