Deceit: Dr Ellen MacInnes (pictured) was banned from the roads for drink-driving and used a sample of clean blood from her own patient in Essex to try to con testers that she was all clear

A family doctor has been found guilty of a ‘grave abuse of trust’ for taking blood from a patient and pretending it was her own in an attempt to beat a drink driving ban.

Dr Ellen MacInnes, 46, claimed she was checking for an ‘underlying medical condition’ when she took a syringe of the female patient’s blood.

But she instead submitted the vial as if it were her blood to medical experts working for licensing authority the DVLA – along with a forged signature from another doctor – in an effort to convince them she was sober after a string of drink driving convictions and a driving ban.

A General Medical Council panel heard that the married mother of four had sent the ‘clean’ sample of blood with the forged signature in an unsuccessful attempt to deceive the DVLA and have her licence reinstated.

The same day she had already submitted a genuine sample of her blood at the Whitley House Surgery in Chelmsford.

Confronted with two samples of blood bearing her name – one ‘clean’ and one containing ‘abnormalities’ – on May 26 last year, staff testing it for the DVLA at the Broomfield Hospital Laboratory became suspicious.

She was required to give another sample and admitted her deception during a further blood  test at the former Royal London  Homeopathic Hospital on August 17 last year. But as the doctor left the room, and the nurse washed her hands, Dr MacInnes snatched the blood vial and fled the hospital.

In an apparent attempt to see if  her blood would come out clean  if tested, she sent a sample of it for analysis to the Baddow  Village Surgery in Chelmsford – where she once worked – using forms filled out with a former patient’s name.

When her sample came back showing ‘abnormalities’ she accessed the surgery’s computer to wipe all traces of it.

Dr MacInnes, of Chelmsford, was found guilty of three charges of  dishonesty by the GMC and suspended for 12 months for serious professional misconduct.

GMC panel chairman Dr Surendra Kumar told Dr MacInnes: ‘The panel heard you took the blood from Ms A under the pretence it was to be tested to discover if she had an underlying illness.

Dr MacInnes was formerly of the Baddow Village Surgery in Essex (pictured) but has been suspended for a year

‘The panel took a grave view of your abusing her trust in you in such a way.’

He added: ‘Your dishonest actions have the potential to undermine the reputation of the profession as a whole.’

Dr MacInnes admitted the charges of dishonesty, but claimed they were ‘sudden irrational decisions’ – a view the GMC said was ‘not credible’.

She was previously suspended by the GMC’s fitness to practise panel in 2009 for a period of six months following a spate of drink-related incidents.

The previous misconduct hearing was told her brushes with the law began in 2004 when she was convicted of drink driving and disqualified at North West Essex Magistrates’ Court.

In January 2006 a practice nurse smelt alcohol on the doctor’s breath ‘from some feet away’ while  she was fitting a contraceptive coil.  

She was fired later the same month after she appeared drunk and smelling of alcohol at a surgery meeting.

A further drink driving conviction followed in 2007.
