A 14-year-old boy, who was so badly beaten by bullies that he spent the next 16 months in hospital with brain damage, has died after fulfilling his last wish - to see the sea.

Antonio de Jesus Lopez Monje was attacked by a group of older boys from his school as he walked home in Amozoc, central Mexico.

They beat him in a 'mindless and sickening' attack - and he was taken to hospital with a blood clot in the brain and subsequently went into a coma.

After surgery, he came out of the coma but was left with severe brain damage which had paralysed half of his body and left him with memory loss.

Nine operations later, surgeons found that he was partially brain dead and had lost 60% of his sight in the vicious attack.

Antonio's devastated father Roberto Castro Barranco said: 'For so long we had been clinging onto the faintest hope that he would come through and come back to us.

'But when we heard that his condition was worsening we were worried even more, and started to believe that all the medical help was not doing much for him.'

When his condition began to worsen, his family discharged him against medical advice so he could see the sea

He added: 'He wanted one thing and that was to be by the sea.

'He longed to feel the waves, touch the sand and smell the sea breeze.

'So eventually we decided to take him out of hospital to give him that.'

Against medical advice, Antonio was discharged and went to stay with his grandmother in Ensenada, a coastal city in north-western Mexico.

He died three months later.  

Mr Barranco added: 'Because of this mindless and sickening attack we have lost the most precious thing to us, the life of our beautiful son.

'I hope the creatures who did this rot in hell.'

Seven youths are awaiting trial for Antonio's murder.
