Ander Herrera is getting used to his new life in England following his move to Manchester United.

The midfielder tweeted a picture of himself in the city centre of his new city, tweeting: 'Enjoying my day off - getting to know my new home Manchester.'

Herrera, 24, signed for the club for £28million from Athletic Bilbao last month.

He has already joined up with his team-mates, including United's other new signing Luke Shaw, but will have to wait a bit longer to meet his new manager, Louis van Gaal, who is still away at the World Cup with Holland.

Herrera signed for Athletic Bilbao in 2011, and went on to score 11 goals in 128 appearances for the club in all competitions.

He become the third young Spaniard to join Manchester United in recent years, following goalkeeper David de Gea and midfielder Juan Mata.
