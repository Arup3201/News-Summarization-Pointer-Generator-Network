A terrifying knifepoint robbery which was captured on CCTV appeared to show an innocent bystander look on in horror as a thief stole a till from a corner shop.

But in fact the witness - who even offered moral support to the victims - was an accomplice helping his flatmate execute the robbery as part of a botched sting operation.

Francis Hobin, who can be seen on the video ducking for cover, had posed as a shopper in the grocery store in Manchester to trick the shopkeeper into opening the till.

Partners in crime: Hobin, left, and Doyle, right, plotted the raid together while living at Hobin's nearby flat

At that moment, Shane Doyle burst in waving a large kitchen knife and demanded the takings before grabbing the till itself and fleeing.

Hobin, 38, pretended to cower in fear at the back of the shop, and after the raid he gave the victim his details and offered to give a witness statement as a 'gesture of support'.

But when police studied CCTV of the incident, they recognised Doyle and discovered that he and Hobin lived together at a flat a few streets away.

The pair were yesterday jailed after Hobin pleaded guilty to robbery and Doyle, 32, was convicted by a jury after a four-day trial.

Fighting back: When the shopkeeper attempted to intervene, Doyle waved the knife at him and punched him

Terror: The 60-something shop assistant screamed for help as Hobin watched on at the back of the store

Back for more: Doyle then apparently decided he would remove the till at take its entire contents away

Manchester Crown Court heard that the robbery in the Newton Heath area took place in September last year.

Hobin went into the shop, picked up a pint of milk and a bag of sugar and went to pay for his groceries.

As
the shop assistant, a 60-something woman, took the money and closed the
till, Doyle ran in wearing sunglasses and a hat in an attempt at a 
disguise.

He demanded money from the till, then grabbed it and tried to pull off the counter.

Disguise: The robber was wearing sunglasses and a large hat in an effort to hide his identity

Robbery: Shane Doyle burst in waving a kitchen knife and demanding the contents of the shop's till

Struggle: He can be seen wrenching the till, which was later found abandoned in a nearby street

The shop owner came to help his colleague, but Doyle lunged towards him with his knife and punched him in the face.

The thief wrenched the till from the counter and ran out with it in his arms.

Throughout the robbery, Hobin remained in the shop watching from six feet away, and told staff to call him if they needed a witness to talk to police.

When the smashed-up till was recovered in the nearby area it was found to have Doyle's fingerprints on it, while a forensic expert told the court that he was the person seen on the CCTV footage.

Success: But Doyle's fingerprints were all over the till and he was soon picked up by police

Aftermath: Hobin offered to give a witness statement even though he was actually an accomplice

Further investigation revealed that Doyle, who committed a string of robberies in his native Ireland, was living at Hobin's home address, and the pair were arrested four days after the crime was committed.

The thief was sentenced to six years in prison, while his accomplice was given a sentence of three years.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a calculated robbery against the owners of this shop, who were subjected to a violent attack at the hands of Doyle, just so he could get his hands on cash from the till to buy drugs.

'Doyle and Hobin have today been sentenced for their actions and I hope that the victims involved in this traumatic incident can take some solace in seeing these men put behind bars.'
