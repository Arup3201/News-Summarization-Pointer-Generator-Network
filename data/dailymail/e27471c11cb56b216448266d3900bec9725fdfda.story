A violent predator killed his girlfriend days after he was released from prison without supervision.

Felipe Lopes, who had been jailed for assaulting another woman, was freed on condition that he saw mental health workers every day.

Yet, despite failing to make a single appointment over two weeks, the 28-year-old was left alone to beat his Russian lover to death with a hockey stick. By then neighbours had already reported two attacks on 23-year-old Anastasia Voykina.

As Lopes was sentenced yesterday, authorities faced serious questions over their failure to monitor him despite his six years of assaults on women.

He was first reported to police for attacking a girlfriend in 2006 and, two years later, broke into her family home and threatened her with a knife as she lay in bed.

He was given a community order for the assault but continued to stalk her for three years, warning probation officers he might kill her.

The Portuguese national attacked her once more while she was in bed, biting her chest, punching her in the face, beating her with a belt and kicking her.

He was spared jail for the assault but started a relationship with another woman and stabbed her – for which he was given yet another suspended sentence and a restraining order. He was eventually jailed for 12 weeks after tracking her down and assaulting her.

Lopes was released from Belmarsh Prison last December but – despite the requirement to report to his mental health team on a daily basis – he was not seen over the Christmas period and staff did not track him down or report him missing.

Living with Miss Voykina in a flat in Streatham, south-west London, he refused to take medication for his schizoid defective disorder and became increasingly violent.

Police were called to the flat twice after neighbours heard attacks so loud the whole building was vibrating. Nothing was done however. The Old Bailey was told Miss Voykina had moved in with Lopes because she was ‘idealistic’ and wanted to help him with his problems.

But, following an argument over a Christmas gift on or around December 29, Lopes sexually assaulted Miss Voykina with an umbrella and battered her in the face up to 60 times with a hockey stick before dragging her to the bath, where she was left in a pool of her own blood.

She is believed to have survived for about an hour and her body lay in the flat for ten days. Lopes’s support team reported him missing when they returned from annual leave in early January.

By then Miss Voykina’s family in Russia had called the police, who broke into the flat and found her body. ‘No one saw the defendant for a period of days over the holidays,’ prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC said. ‘The mental health team returned from leave and were unable to trace him and were about to report him missing.’

Judge Richard Marks told Lopes: ‘There is no doubt in my mind you intended to kill her. You are and will remain for an indefinite time a significantly dangerous man, particularly to women.’

He sentenced Lopes, who admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility because of his mental health problems, to life with a minimum term of seven years and three months. He could be free when he is 35.

Lopes was made subject to an order under Section 45a of the Mental Health Act so he will be detained in hospital until he is well enough to go to prison.A police spokesman said officers twice visited the flat but no allegations were made.
