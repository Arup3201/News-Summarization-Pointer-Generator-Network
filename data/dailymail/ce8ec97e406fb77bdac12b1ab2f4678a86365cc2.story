From dolls houses and miniature dinner party sets, to baseball bats, sunglasses and stuffed teddy bears – these remarkable photographs show the vastly different toys that children from around the world play with on a daily basis.

Photographer Gabriele Galimberti spent over a year visiting more than 50 countries around the world and documenting the prized possessions of young boys and girls.

From Texas to India, Malawi to China and Iceland to Morocco, Mr Galimberti recorded the spontaneous and natural joy that unites children despite their diverse backgrounds. 

Photographer Gabriele Galimberti has spent between 18 months and three years visiting dozens of countries to capture images of the toys children play with around the world. Three-year-old Tyra, pictured with her dolls set and miniature dinner party set, is from Stockholm, Sweden, and features in Mr Galimberti's pictures

The fascinating photographs show the different childhoods youngsters have. Gabriele Galimberti visited more than 50 countries to show the different toys children play with. In Mchinji, Malawai, he met four-year-old Chiwa, pictured, who plays with soft teddy bears and a plastic dinosaur

The images have been collated to form a book called Toy Stories, which contains 54 of Gabriele Galimberti's fascinating portraits including this one of Pavel, five, from Kiev, Ukraine, who is pictured with his toys including plastic fake guns, a police helmet and a walkie talkie

Whether the child owns a fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride that Gabriele Galimberti captures is moving, funny, and thought provoking. He visited more than 50 countries including India, China, Morocco, America, Malawi and Puerto Viejo de Talamanca in Costa Rica where he met three-year-old Naya, pictured

The range of photographs shows boys and girls in their homes and neighbourhoods with their most prized possessions: their toys. In Homer, Alaska, five-year-old Niko's toy collection includes Lego pieces, pictured

Ben Machell, who wrote the introduction to the book Toy Stories, said: 'These toys, Galimberti began to realise, said as much about the mothers and fathers as they did about the children themselves.' In Muskoka, Canada, six-year-old Lauren's favourite toy is a doll dressed in a pink outfit similar to her own, pictured

Ben Machell said in the introduction to the book Toy Stories: 'Everyone remembers their childhood toys. The fact that I can recall how most of mine tasted better than I can remember the names of my primary school teachers says everything you need to know about the universe kids inhabit.' Five-year-old Shotaro, from Tokyo, Japan, is pictured with his favourite toy - baseball bats

The remarkable collection of photographs shows the distinct difference between children's toys in differing countries. In Zambia Gabriele Galimberti met Maudy, three, whose toy collection consists of brightly-coloured sunglasses, pictured

Introducing the Toy Stories book, Ben Machell, said: 'More common was how the toys reflected the world each child was born into: so the boy from an affluent Beijing family loves Monopoly, because he likes the idea of building houses and hotels, while the boy from rural Mexico loves trucks, because he sees them rumbling through his village to the nearby sugar plantation every day.' Pictured - Enea, three, from Colorado

Four-year-old Taha, from Beirut, Lebanon, pictured, features in the book with his one and only toy - a toy car. He's a refugee together with his family and lives in a 'sort of shantytown' with a few thousand other people

Mikkel, five, from Bergen, Norway, enjoys dressing up as a pirate and playing with miniature plastic pirate characters. In doing the three-year long project, Gabriele Galimberti said he noticed how toys hadn't changed that much over the last three decades

Julius, three, from Lausanne, Switzerland, is pictured with an array of toys from his collection including toy cars, Lego pieces and a miniature sword and shield. Italian photographer Gabriele Galimberti visited more than 50 countries to take the fascinating array of photographs

Photographer Gabriele Galimberti has collated 54 colourful photographs into a book called Toy Stories, pictured, which show the differing types of toys children from different countries play with on a day-to-day basis
