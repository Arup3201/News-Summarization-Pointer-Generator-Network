A formerly straight woman who woke up with another female in her bed after a big night out has penned a book about the exploration of her sexuality.

Titled Lesbian For A Year, author Brooke Hemphill said despite the expected criticism surrounding the title and subject matter, the book's aim is to open up a dialogue about tolerance and acceptance of different sexualities.

'As predicted from the outset people who've not read the book and just seen the title and have an emotional reaction to it can't get past that,' Brooke told Daily Mail Australia.

'But it wasn't a social experiment. It was a series of events that sort of led to this period of time in my life', she added.

The book is an exploration of her own sexuality but also aims to open dialogue about tolerance

The real kicker came after a big night when the author woke up with a serious hangover and an unexpected guest in her home.

'I was out one night in Sydney at a gay bar on Oxford Street with some friends ... I had a few drinks and woke up and low and behold there was a naked woman beside me in my bed,' she revealed.

From there an unrelated offer to work with a director on a pilot for a show about a group of lesbian women in Sydney led Brooke to the next step of her journey.

Shortly after filming, she began a relationship with one of the ladies, dubbed by friends as 'Claire the converter'. 

'She was known to turn straight girls over to her team' Brooke said.

However some in the LGBT community have been offended by the book's title, suggesting it simplifies the often complex issue of sexuality by implying it's a choice.

To this, Brooke said it was not her intention to upset and did not want to detract from other's sexual experiences, but instead hoped it would open up the discussion about the fluidity of sexuality.

'I understand that by putting the word (lesbian) on the cover of the book there are people out there, they kinda own that word and they would feel I guess challenged and get a sense that I don't really have a right to use that.'

Brooke said she understands why people might be upset by the title but hopes they can instead relate to her experience

'I don't want to offend anyone but it's a pretty catchy title', Brooke added.

On where she now stands in relation to her own sexuality, the Sydney woman said she didn't think it needed to be labelled.

'Everyone is very keen for me to put a label on it - if you have to put a label on it I guess I would say that would be bisexuality,' Brooke said.

The Sydney woman suggested that if more people shared intimacy with those of the same sex, there would be greater understanding and less homophobia

She suggested that many others may relate to her story and that if more people shared intimacy with those of the same sex, there would be greater understanding and less homophobia.

'If you have the luxury of having a fluid sexuality then you're in an enviable position where you can choose your partner based on factors such as personality and not just gender,' Brooke said.

'Maybe in 10-15 years I might be with a woman again... but my mother did tell me on the weekend she wouldn't be very happy about that,' she laughed.

Lesbian for a Year by Brooke Hemphill is available now through Affirm Press for $29.99.
