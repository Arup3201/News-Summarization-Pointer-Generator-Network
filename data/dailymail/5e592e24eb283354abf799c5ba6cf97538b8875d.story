A mother has told how she spotted her son's extremely rare cancer after his eye began to glow.  

Callum Holmes was just six months old when his right eye began to look shiny, due to a tumour called a retinoblastoma. 

His mother Erin, 33, caught a glance of it when he turned his head at an angle, unaware that she was looking at a potentially lethal disease.

Ordeal: Callum's cancer was so advanced that the only treatment available was to have his whole eye removed, to ensure the disease didn't spread any further

She said: 'It was like a cat's eyes that you see on the road. You would look at him and see it, and then look again and it wasn't there. 

'Only I noticed it to begin with and then others began to pick up on it. We thought it was just light reflecting in his eye.

'People sometimes pick it up on photograph as the person appears to have a white eye, rather than a red eye that you might otherwise see.'

But after being referred to a specialist eye clinic, doctors confirmed Callum was suffering from retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer that affects just 40-50 children each year in the UK.  

The disease generally develops in children under the age of five, however some are born with it. 

It develops in the cells of the retina, the light-sensitive lining of the eye.

Symptoms of retinoblastoma can include an abnormal appearance of the pupil, which tends to reflect light as a white reflex.

Rare: Retinoblastoma, the type of cancer that Callum (pictured here with mother Erin) was suffering from, affects just 40-50 children each year in the UK

Replacement: After losing his right eye, Callum (with father Dan) was fitted with an artificial one

Some children have a squint, however 
less common signs are a deterioration of vision, a red and irritated 
pupil without infection or a change to the colour of one iris.

'I sobbed my heart out when they told us,' said Mrs Holmes. 'They said we were very lucky to spot it.'

The only treatment available at this stage of development for Callum was to have his whole eye removed to ensure the cancer didn't spread any further. 

The youngster, from Leeds, underwent the operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital when he was just 11-months old. 

His father Daniel, 34, said: 'It seemed harsh and it was tough making the decision to take out our son's eye but we had to be blunt about it. 

'They had to put him under and remove the eye, but it meant the cancer would be totally gone.'

While retinoblastoma is easily treated if caught early, failing to remove the eye in time can cause it to spread down the optic nerve.

Callum will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands

Hope: Callum's mother Erin is now trying to raise awareness of the rare condition

'Callum had a category D tumour so it was very big,' said his mother, a PE teacher. 'They only go up to category E so we knew it was something we just had to do. 

'They fitted Callum with an artificial eye so that the nerve endings can be attached to it. It's a small porous ball which a shell is fitted on top of, like a big contact lens.'

As Callum's cancer was retained within his eye, he didn't have to undergo any follow-up treatment such as chemotherapy. 

He will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands. 

Mrs Holmes said: 'It's amazing how they can make bespoke eyes for your child. If felt like I had got my son back seeing him with two eyes again, it was all a very surreal experience.

Awareness: The family now wants other parents to check their children's eyes

'The artificial eyes are very realistic and they will make as many as we want until we find one that looks as good as possible for Callum.'

She is now using her experiences with Callum to help raise support for the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), a charity dedicated to supporting families affected by retinoblastoma. 

'I just want other parents to go and get their children's eyes checked and make the disease more widely known,' she said.

Callum's father Dan, a finance director, added: 'If Erin hadn't spotted his eyes 
shining, it could have been a very different outcome. We feel so lucky 
that everything has worked out so well.'
