Adrian Peterson's high school football coach has revealed how he used to beat the star player when he misbehaved - and claimed he was thanked by him afterwards.

Booker Bowie said that the Minnesota Vikings running back would get up to three lashes with an 18 inch long wooden paddle he kept in his office as part of what he called 'tough love'.

But afterwards rather than crying or complaining to his parents, Peterson would simply say: 'Coach, thank you', said Bowie.

Under fire: Peterson (on Tuesday, left, and in mugshot, right) was indicted on child injury charges last week amid claims he whipped his four-year-old son during a visit to the star's Texas home in May

Bowie also said that Peterson had 'suffered enough' in the row over his alleged abuse of his children and that he should be allowed to just move on because he had learned his lesson.

Peterson, 29, has been indicted on charges of causing injury to a child after allegedly beating his son, four, with a switch, when he was visiting the player in Spring, Texas, in May.

The boy had wounds on his thighs, backside and even his genitals following the beating.

Peterson was suspended for one game by the Vikings but was allowed back onto the team despite his actions plunging the NFL into a fresh crisis over domestic abuse, following the Ray Rice controversy. 

But in a U-turn late Tuesday, he was banned from all team activities until the outcome of the case.

It followed an intervention from politicians and also some of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and McDonald's, who voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to continue to play 

It also emerged on Tuesday that Peterson had also been accused of abusing another of his sons, also four, but no charges were filed.

Bowie, 59, was Peterson's defensive coordinator and track coach at Palestine High School in Texas until his student left in 2004 on a football scholarship for the University of Oklahoma.

Speaking from his home in Tyler, Texas, Bowie explained that he used to hit his students if they stepped out of line. He said that he talked to his students before he hit them and then explained afterwards why he did what he did.

He told MailOnline: 'It wasn't my intention to abuse the kids, the kids loved me for it. I wanted them to do right. They said: "Coach, thank you". 

'Tough love': Friends of Peterson told how his mother, Bonita, and father, Nelson, used corporal punishment to discipline the running back. Nelson once whipped Peterson with a belt in front of his school

Peterson (pictured with his mother and father distributing meals on Thanksgiving n his hometown of Palestine, Texas) was nicknamed AD, or All Day, because he had so much energy, but this meant he was more likely to get a 'whupping' from his father, relatives said

Coach: Booker Bowie told MailOnline that Peterson had 'suffered enough'

'Adrian understands corporal punishment...it's not intended to hurt anybody, it's to get them going in the right direction. I have never had a problem with parents calling anyone complaining.

'The way Adrian came up, his parents, his mother was disciplining him. He understands it, it helped his team mates, his classmates. I think that’s what he was doing (to his son).'

Bowie said: 'His intention was not to abuse the kid. He understands corporal punishment and I don't think his intention was to abuse the kid.

'We all sometimes make mistakes, not intentionally. He just needs to move on from it. I think he's suffered enough. I think he's learned from this'.

Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but it can result in a felony conviction if it is judged to be too severe. 

Peterson's indictment has intensified the scrutiny on the NFL and sparked a nationwide debate on the use of violence in raising children.

It comes after the controversy with Rice, who was seen on video in February dragging his then fiance and now wife Janay out of a hotel elevator as she was unconscious.

Rice was given a two game suspension by the NFL until a video emerged last week of a shocking video from inside the elevator where Rice is seen punching his wife out cold.

Rice was then cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the league.

In a statement Peterson has said that he is not an abuser and the tough way his parents disciplined him has 'a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man'. 

But his comments have divided his fans with some, including former NBA star Charles Barkley, saying that there is nothing wrong with it.

Others however believe that corporal punishment is a cruel way of raising a child and results in a cycle of violence which Peterson has been playing out.

A report in USA Today has also shed further light on his harsh upbringing at the hands of his father Nelson.

Too far: Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but is a felony offense if it is too severe. Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said on Tuesday that 'whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds (above), as has been alleged, should not be tolerated in our state'

Peterson’s childhood friend David Cummings, 29, said that one afternoon he beat his son with a belt in the car park in front of 20 students at Palestine Middle School because he had been disruptive in class.

Cummings told USA Today: 'We still talk about it to this day. My dad was tough, but his dad was real tough.'

He added that even though it may shock some people this kind of parenting was 'normal' in Palestine, Texas, where they all grew up.

Peterson's uncles Larry and Greg Peterson said that their nephew's father used to beat his son with a tree branch.

So keen was Nelson Peterson to discipline his son that when he was told he needed medication for attention deficit disorder he objected and said: 'It's not something that a little whipping can't take care of'.

Peterson was nicknamed AD, or All Day, because he had so much energy, but this meant he was more likely to get a 'whupping' from his father, relatives said.

His stepmother Phyllis Peterson told USA Today: 'I think every parent has the right to discipline their child. He (Nelson) wouldn't intentionally harm his child. He loves his children.'

Peterson was suspended on Tuesday after a dramatic intervention from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton.

He said: 'It is an awful situation. Yes, Mr. Peterson is entitled to due process and should be "innocent until proven guilty". However, he is a public figure; and his actions, as described, are a public embarrassment to the Vikings organization and the State of Minnesota. 

'Whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds, as has been alleged, should not be tolerated in our state. Therefore, I believe the team should suspend Mr. Peterson, until the accusations of child abuse have been resolved by the criminal justice system.'

My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child.

'I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son.

'I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court.

'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate.

'I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make.

'I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day.

'I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person.
