The mayor of the Douglas shire, Julia Leu, offered her condolences calling Daniel a, 'much-loved local high school graduate', reports ABC. 

'Our hearts very much go out to his family. It is a real shock to all of us that this has occurred.

Friends and family take to Facebook to pay tribute to teenage fisherman Daniel Smith killed by shark attack on Monday

People have taken to social media to express their grief and shock at the death of the former Mossman State High School student

'He had just completed year 12 at Mossman State High School - he was a lovely fellow and we are very, very sad that this has happened.' 

The Melbourne born, Queenslander was  attacked in the water at Rudder Reef, off Port Douglas, in far north Queensland at around 11am on Monday.

He is said to have been swimming when he lost part of his leg, reports The Guardian.

The trip back to shore by boat is said to be a two-hour journey.

Friends who were travelling with the teenager on a private boat alerted authorities and performed emergency first aid, using a defibrillator that was on board.

Attempts were also made by Queensland Ambulance to resuscitate him but he died on Monday afternoon, the ABC reports.

The victim, who is local to the area, was pronounced dead before the boat brought him back to Sugar Wharf in Port Douglas at 2pm,The Cairns Post said.  

Queensland Ambulance Service executive manager of operations Greg Thiedecke said: 'When they arrived, the people [on the boat] were still doing CPR on him, trying to save him.

'We did have Mossman hospital on stand-by with a doctor ... but unfortunately when we arrived, he was well and truly passed.'

Thiedecke added: 'It would be speculating but [there are] a lot of large blood vessels in the groin area, so for him to go into cardiac arrest that quickly would be probably blood loss.'

Queensland Ambulance Service executive manager of operations Greg Thiedecke told The Cairns Post he believes the death was due to loss of blood

It's not known what kind of shark was involved in the attack. 

A coroner's report will be prepared for the police. 

Veteran diver Col McKenzie, who also heads the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, told Australian Associated Press that Rudder Reef was not a common spot for dive tourism operators.

But he said it was popular with spear fishing enthusiasts, and that there was a fatal shark attack at nearby Opal Reef almost a decade ago to the day.

Spearfisherman Mark Thompson, 38, died from a heart attack soon after being attacked by a shark December 11, 2004.

St Crispin's reef separates Opal and Rudder reefs, and there is little distance between them.

Mr McKenzie said spear fishers who were attacked by sharks typically suffered thigh injuries because they often tucked bait into their weight belts.

'A lot of people do spear fish in that area but whether that's what's happened here, I don't know,' the Cairns resident said.
