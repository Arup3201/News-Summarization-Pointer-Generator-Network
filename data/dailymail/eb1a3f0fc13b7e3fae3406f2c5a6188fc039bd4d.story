Italian star Valentino Rossi pipped Andrea Dovizioso to win the opening race of the 2015 MotoGP season in Qatar.

Rossi, a seven-time world champion in MotoGP, had started on the third row on his Yamaha but worked his way up the grid and claimed victory by just 0.174 seconds ahead of compatriot Dovizioso.

Dovizioso's Ducati team-mate Andrea Iannone claimed third, 2.250secs adrift of the winner to make it an all-Italian podium.

Rossi's team-mate Jorge Lorenzo finished fourth, while reigning two-time champion Marc Marquz rounded out the top five after recovering from a poor start.

The 22-year-old Spaniard ran wide on the opening lap and slumped to the back of the pack, but he fought his way back into contention to ensure his season did not get off to a disastrous start.

It was later reported Marquez had set the fastest ever recorded speed in MotoGP on his charge up the grid, at one point reaching 217.66mph.

His Repsol Honda team-mate Dani Pedrosa was sixth, while British pair Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith finished seventh and eighth respectively.
