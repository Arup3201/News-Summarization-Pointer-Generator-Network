To bite another human being is an animalistic instinct and is, quite frankly, inhumane.

For someone to lower themselves to that level on a football pitch is wholly unacceptable.

Following Luis Suarez's latest alleged attempt to take a bite out of an opponent, FIFA must be strong and throw the book at him. They must act as the IRB have on many occasions in rugby.

Cover up?Luis Suarez holds his teeth in pain after allegedly biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini

Inhumane: Suarez appears to bite Giorgio Chiellini during the Group D showdown

Evidence: Chiellini shows the damage inflicted - and FIFA should come down hard on Suarez

Hurt? Suarez holds his mouth after the incident with Chiellini and he should receive a lengthy ban

The Liverpool striker has not bitten a fellow professional once. He has not even done it twice. This is the third time in five years that Suarez has taken it upon himself to sink his teeth into opposing players.

There were three years between the first and second incidents, but just 14 months between the second and third.

Action has to be taken to ensure he does not do this again - it must be swift and it must be lengthy.

FIFA have announced that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez for his alleged bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 victory over Italy, and they must set a precedent.

In rugby union, the maximum ban for biting an opponent is 208 weeks - or four years - and harsh penalties have been handed out before.

The rugby authorities are not shy when it comes to long and severe penalties. They protect the integrity of the game by preventing heinous acts from being repeated through lengthy bans.

Controversy: Suarez (top left) is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013

Suspension: Bath prop Kevin Yates received a six-month ban for biting in 1998

Attacked: London Scottish player Simon Fenn was bitten by Bath prop Kevin Yates

Trial: Bath prop Yates at RFU hearing when he was banned for six months for biting

Lenient: England hooker Dylan Hartley was only given an eight-week ban due to inconclusive evidence

When South African prop Johan Le Roux bit New Zealander Sean FitzPatrick in July 1994, he was handed an 18-month suspension from the game.

In 1998, Bath prop Kevin Yates also sunk his teeth into an opponent, biting London Scottish flanker Simon Fenn's ear, and he received a six-month ban.

And England hooker Dylan Hartley received an eight-week suspension for biting Ireland's Stephen Ferris during the Six Nations in 2012 - a lenient ban considering the minimum should be 12 weeks, but the evidence was not strong enough to penalise him further. If it had been conclusive then he would have been looking at a matter of months, not weeks.

If football's governing body follow rugby's example then they will come down on Suarez like a ton of bricks.

It is time that FIFA act properly and are hard on a persistent offender of a disgusting act.

Too often is it said that football should follow rugby's example in many aspects of the game, but on this occasion they most certainly should.

Suarez received a 10-match ban from the FA for biting Chelsea' Branislav Ivanovic last year and a seven-game suspension for sinking his teeth into PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal while he was at Ajax.

If you add those two together then you would still be nowhere near the length of the ban that should be given out.

For a persistent offender the retribution must be severe.

A four-year ban like in rugby? Maybe not quite, but FIFA should be thinking in terms of years and months, not weeks, when they serve Suarez's sentence.
