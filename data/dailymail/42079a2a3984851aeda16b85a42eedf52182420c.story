The appeal of a Rolex watch is, well, timeless. And that's probably why the brand retains its place as the number one in Britain.

The Swiss watchmaker beat Apple and Microsoft into second and third places in an annual Consumer Superbrands list, voted on by 3,000 Britons.

Stephen Cheliotis, chairman of the 
Superbrands Expert Council, said: 'As consumers remain unsettled and 
fearful over what feels like endless economic doom and gloom, 
malpractice in key institutions and a weakening position for Britain in a
changing world, it is perhaps no surprise that we are turning to 
reassuringly familiar brands that we have known throughout our lives - 
often much-loved British establishments that we still trust, despite 
recent problems for some.

'In addition, voters recognise newer 
technology brands that make our lives simpler, happier and 
better-connected in these difficult times.'

Heathrow Airport was deemed to be a 
superbrand by 71 per cent of voters and 80 per cent of Londoners, while 
British Airways won fourth place after ranking at 33rd place last year.

Apple moved up 16 places this year while Microsoft improved on last year's ranking at 45.

Facebook took 14th place this year but was not joined by Twitter, which languished at 86 on the list.

The BBC retained a place in the top 20 
but dropped from last year's fifth spot to 13, while Marks & Spencer
was was the only retailer to achieve top 20 superbrand status at 17th 
place.
