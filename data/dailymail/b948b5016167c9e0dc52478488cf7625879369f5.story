A man stabbed his friend's grandmother in the heart and slashed her face more than 40 times to steal £104 of her pension before telling a court he had acted in self-defence.

Liam Naylor, who referred to himself as 'superstud' during an appearance on Jeremy Kyle, brutally murdered Doreen Walker at her home in Cudworth, Barnsley after telling friends he was finding money for a night out. 

Leaving the 75-year-old's body lying on the ground with a kitchen knife lodged in her neck, he spent the stolen money on alcohol and McDonald's for his friends, including the victim's granddaughter, that night.

After fleeing to Skegness with the victim's granddaughter Keeley Sweeney, 17, he was arrested and charged with the pensioner's murder but told Sheffield Crown Court he had acted in self-defence. 

Naylor, who has four children and once appeared on Jeremy Kyle amid a paternity dispute with one of the children's mothers, was convicted of murder following a week-long trial. 

Sheffield Crown Court heard Naylor, 23, sent a text message to a friend telling them to lay out clean clothes for him to go out in Barnsley after murdering Mrs Walker in her home on April 1. 

He had visited the house that evening after telling friends he was sourcing money for a night out. 

Rifling through the woman's home - where he had stayed overnight with Miss Sweeney three weeks before the attack - he found £104 pension money which had been picked up that day. 

Naylor then carried out the 'savage' attack, after which he laid Mrs Walker's head on a pillow before washing his hands of her blood.

He then sent himself a string of text messages to create a false alibi involving borrowing money. 

Friends of the man told the court he had returned 'agitated' and covered in blood before going out and torching his stained clothes in a city centre underpass.

Naylor was captured on CCTV entering the woman's home about 9.30pm and emerged two hours later

Police arrested Naylor after Mrs Walker's body was found in her home the following morning by her son-in-law

He treated friends to a night out, then fled to Skegness with Miss Sweeney, Mrs Walker's granddaughter' the following day. 

Following his initial arrest, he told police he hadn't harmed the woman and that a cut on his hand, sustained during the murder, was inflicted when he fought a man in the street who was carrying a knife. 

Later, he told the court the woman had 'jumped into' the kitchen knife after Naylor took it from her when she 'came at him' with it in her hand and that he was acting in self defence. 

The claims were dismissed as 'ludicrous and utterly incredible' by prosecutor Simon Waley during the trial. 

Naylor was unanimously convicted of murder today and will be sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court today. 

Detective Superintendent Richard Fewkes today said: 'It remains unclear what was going through his mind when he committed one of the most brutal murders I have dealt with in my 29-year career. 

Following a week-long trial Naylor was unanimously convicted of murder by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured). He will be sentenced tomorrow  

'Whatever motive there was can never excuse the brutality of the assault. It was a brutal, savage and unprovoked attack and the account he put forward that he was acting in self-defence was ludicrous.

'I have watched Liam Naylor give evidence and throughout there was an air or arrogance about him. On occasions he was even smiling. 

'That sums him up. Doreen was very much a home bird and an elderly woman. She was frail and

had the onset of arthritis and was partially deaf but she was kind and on occasions extended that kindness to Liam Naylor which makes this offence even more abhorrent.'

The 23-year-old will be sentenced tomorrow. 

Following his conviction an episode of Jeremy Kyle in which he describes himself as 'superstud' emerged. 

During his appearance he tells the audience he has stolen money in the past to 'be there for his children'.
