The first time I tried to lure a robin to feed from my hand, I failed.

My experience with wildlife is almost entirely based on mammals, and I was not convinced that your heart could easily be captured by a bird.

Perhaps my lack of commitment shone through as I stood near the specks of organic mature cheddar I had placed on the garden table, waiting for the robin, which seemed to glower at me from the nearby dogwood, to swoop down and accept my offering.

The reason I was trying to lure him to my hand was down to robin expert Andrew Lack, whom I had met while writing my latest book, The Beauty In The Beast. 

I had challenged a number of wildlife gurus to convince me that their favourite species was equal to my own, the hedgehog. 

Andrew, obviously, had opted for the robin. The challenge was life-changingly serious — I had rather rashly declared I would get a tattoo of the species to join the one of a hedgehog I already had on my left ankle.

I have long held that the hedgehog is the most important creature on the planet. Between its muddy little paws are held the keys to the salvation of humanity. 

This is because its behaviour allows us to get so close to it. 

While most wildlife flees or attacks you when you approach, the hedgehog just rolls itself into a ball.It can be a profound experience coming nose to nose with a wild animal, and that’s what you can do with a hedgehog. Could I get as up close and personal to a robin?

I wasn’t confident — even though the British people’s bond with robins goes back many years.

Elsewhere, the bird is hunted. But here, thanks to the way we garden, the robin has struck up a peculiar relationship with human beings.

Why? Because to the robin we are little more than tall pigs. In their natural habitat, the woodland edge, they follow wild boar, watching as they turn over the soil and expose food.

And what do we do in the garden? We weed and dig — and the robin hops along behind us. But the bond between man and robin is not just down to our pig-like behaviour. The robin does itself a lot of favours by being bold, bright and musical in the bleakest months. 

People have found you can tame robins to feed from your hand, which is what Andrew Lack had told me about. He learned the technique from his mother, who always had a ‘pet’ robin.

Last year, a recently fledged robin was tolerating my presence in the garden. And though I tried to lure it to feed from my hand, I failed. 

Then, this summer, a bold redbreast, which I like to think is the same one (though they have such short lives that might not be the case), appeared just outside the conservatory door.

Not expecting much, I took a few crumbs of cheese, put them on the table outside and waited nearby.The robin swooped, took a piece of cheese and was off again. I had just completed the first hurdle.

A few minutes later the robin was back so I set up the next step — cheese on the table, but this time I stood closer, with my hand out. A little more hesitantly, the robin came closer, bounced around the far side of the table, before flitting across, pinching the cheese and disappearing down the garden with a thrumming of wings.

The next day, it was back, and this time I placed the cheese on the table, but with my hand nearby.

Again, more hesitation, but it came and grabbed another crumb of mature cheddar. Later in the day, I heard the rapid flutter of wings and a little cheep. I decided to be as bold as the robin and placed the cheese on the tips of my fingers, with my hand on the table.

Hopping around, plucking up courage, the robin came close, before flying away without the treat. I realised I had been holding my breath.

The next day I repeated the exercise, though this time with my camera in the other hand — at least, I thought, I would get a nice close-up of the bird. Hop, hop it came, closer and closer, then a dart forward. It took the cheese and buzzed off. I had completely forgotten to take a photograph.

Elated, I went back to the fridge for more cheese, and over the next three weeks we struck up an understanding — the robin will pose for a photograph on my hand for around 1/500th of a second in return for a piece of cheese the size of a grain of rice. Apart from the neighbour’s cat, my only worry for the bird is its cholesterol levels.

I took the first photographs to show my doubting friends that the magical connection between the robin and me had happened. But then I noticed how beautiful the bird was, so I began to take out a camera with me every time.

When the robin hovered nervously to begin with, as it decided whether to come for the food or not, this gave me a rare view of the wings, trembling in mid air. 

As it became bolder, the wings seemed to look different because it flew in more directly, sometimes folding them back like a falcon.

And then, when it was even more comfortable, I got shots of the great fan of feathers that make up the wing of this amazing little bird. 

Sometimes it seemed to be dancing on my hand as it perched for a fraction of a second before darting away with its prize.

The feathers around the face are so fine. Without the camera, I would never have seen so closely what makes a robin special.

I have been lucky enough to be able to share the delight — my wife, children and friends have all enjoyed moments of wildlife connection.

One morning I was having a snooze in the conservatory when I was woken by a ‘cheep, cheep . . .’ I looked down and the robin was hopping around my feet. 

I got some cheese and as I stood there, feeding the bird, it dawned on me that perhaps I had not trained the robin — it had trained me.

Perhaps I should consider that tattoo after all.
