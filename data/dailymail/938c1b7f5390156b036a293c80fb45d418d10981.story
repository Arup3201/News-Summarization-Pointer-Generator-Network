Arjen Robben has revealed that Holland's 2010 World Cup final loss to Spain 'still hurts' - and that he will only get over it if he can lift the trophy in Brazil.

The Dutch got all the way to the final in South Africa but agonisingly lost 1-0 to Spain in extra time, courtesy of Andres Iniesta's 116th-minute strike.

And Robben says that the pain is similar to how he felt when his club side Bayern Munich lost to Chelsea at their home ground, the Allianz Arena, in the 2012 Champions League final before claiming that trophy the following season - with the Dutchman himself scoring the winning goal.

Robben said: ‘The final defeat from 2010 still hurts - it's not something you just get over.

'I experienced something similar with Bayern when we lost the Champions League final against Chelsea. It hurt - and the only cure was putting it right by lifting the trophy.

'That is the only way we will get over the 2010 loss - by going one better this time.'

But the 30-year-old winger, who has scored 23 goals in 75 appearances for the Dutch national side, insists tonight's World Cup opener with Spain is not about revenge, but about progressing in the tournament.

He said: ‘I don't look at this game against Spain as a chance to get revenge - it isn't about that at all.

'It is just about winning the game and giving us the best chance to progress out of the group - and hopefully even win it.'

Robben is also fully behind his coach, newly-appointed Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal, who he believes can take them all the way in Brazil before taking up the reins at Old Trafford.

The former Chelsea star continued: ‘He (Van Gaal) has us a very organised team and playing well.

'It was clear why Manchester United wanted him so badly - with Pep he is the best coach in the world and we could not ask for a better national coach.’
