Albert James was a federal Labor MP between 1960 and 1980. Newly released documents say that during that time he was working as a KGB informant

Newly released Russian intelligence documents have revealed that a federal Labor MP was a secret KGB informant.

Albert James, who served as the federal member for Hunter, in NSW, from 1960 to 1980, was listed as an informant in secret intelligence papers.

The documents belonged to Vasili Mitrokhin, a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992, bringing with him extensive records about Russian intelligence operations, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

James, codename Agent Albert, is one of a number of Australian listed in Mitrokhin's records as a KGB agent or informant during the 1960s and 1970s.

It is not known what information James passed to the Soviet Union, but he was known for being strongly opposed to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War and spoke in favour if the communist regime in Cuba under Fidel Castro.

This is the first time allegations that James was a KGB informant have come to light, but ASIO records did show that James was in regular contact with an official at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, Alexander Ekimenko, who was suspected by ASIO of being an intelligence officer, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

James, who served as a policeman for 20 years before winning the seat of Hunter, which was previously held by his father Rowley James, passed away in 2006 at the age of 92.

Other Australians named in the intelligence files include Silver', believed to be Reginald de Bray, a professor of Russian at Monash University and â€˜student K', believed to be Katerina Clark, the daughter of famous Australian historian Manning Clark.

Ms Clark studied in Moscow through an academic exchange programme and when Professor de Bray travelled the Soviet Union, he expressed an interest in Ms Clark's contacts and work.

The documents containing information about the Australian informants and agents were released by the Churchill College Archive in the United Kingdom last month.
