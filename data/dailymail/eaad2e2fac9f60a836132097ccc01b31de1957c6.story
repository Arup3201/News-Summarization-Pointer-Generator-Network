Two new drugs that will transform the chances of surviving malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, are to be approved for use by the NHS.

Doctors claim ipilimumab and vemurafenib are the first major advance in treatment for 30 years because they increase survival for patients with advanced disease.

Ipilimumab extends lifespan by an average of almost four months in trials on patients where the cancer has spread to other organs - who have no other options. But some patients are alive many years later.

It's estimated the drugs could help up to 1,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s

It is estimated the drugs could benefit up to 1,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s.

The decision is a U-turn by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) which originally rejected their use on the NHS, saying they were too expensive.

Top doctors wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron to protest about the proposed ban.

Nice says it has since received additional data about the cost effectiveness of the drugs and is recommending them on the basis that the manufacturers will give the NHS a discount.

Ipilimumab costs £18,000 for a course of treatment and vemurafenib, also known as zelboraf, costs £1,750 a month.

Dr Paul Lorigan, Senior Lecturer in Medical Oncology, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, one of the leading trial centres for ipilimumab in the UK, said ‘After 30 years of no progress in the treatment of this terrible illness, this represents a genuine step change in the management of this disease.’

Trials show ipilimumab, also known as Yervoy and made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, increases lifespan by an average of almost four months in patients where the cancer has spread to other organs,.

But British doctors carrying out trials say up to one in four patients is still alive four years after treatment.

Vemurafenib, made by Roche, works in patients who have a cancer-causing form of the BRAF gene, around half of cases.

More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die. It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s

Patients in trials lived an average of 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for patients receiving standard chemotherapy, but other research from US and Australia showed it nearly doubled average survival times to around 16 months.

Both drugs have been paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, set up by the Government to make drugs available which are awaiting approval or have been rejected by Nice.

The Fund does not operate in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland where the drugs have not been available.

Dr Lorigan said ‘If Nice had not approved these drugs and they had been withdrawn, it would have been a disaster.

‘I think patient power made the difference, Nice listened to patients and their families about how little hope there was before these drugs came along.’

Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the London-based Institute of Cancer Research, said ‘We are delighted that zelboraf, which the Institute of Cancer Research helped to make possible, is now to become available on the NHS.

‘It represents a great stride forward in the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma, and is a brilliant example of what new-generation targeted cancer therapies can achieve.’

Gill Nuttall, of the patient support group Factor 50, said ‘This is very welcome news for patients with advanced melanoma, who have waited such a long time for any new treatment options that have the potential to extend life.

‘The important thing now will be for positive guidance to be implemented as soon as possible so that suitable patients can be given a chance to benefit from this treatment.’

More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die.It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s.

Professor Carole Longson, director at the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at Nice, said ‘For many years the treatments available for this condition have been very limited and in some cases restricted to palliative care.

‘Vemurafenib and ipilimumab are breakthrough treatments that can potentially significantly affect prognosis for these patients and we are very pleased that the manufacturers have worked with us so that we are now able to recommend them both.’

Draft guidance approving the drugs for NHS use is likely to be finalised in December.
