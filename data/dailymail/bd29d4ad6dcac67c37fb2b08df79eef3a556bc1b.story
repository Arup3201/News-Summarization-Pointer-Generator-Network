Jailed: Tracey Connelly, mother of abused toddler Baby Peter, is understood to be working as a hairdresser in Low Newton women's prison Durham

The mother of Baby P has angered fellow inmates after being given a job as a hairdresser in jail.

Tracey Connelly will be given a pair of scissors and allowed to work on other criminals at Low Newton women's prison in Durham, according to reports.

Connelly, who was jailed for five years in 2009 over the death of her son Peter, is understood to be getting paid for the role.

The 31-year-old was labelled 'manipulative, self-centred and calculating' during her trial in the Old Bailey.

Connelly viciously attacked two of her children and did nothing while Peter was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen.

Inmates at the prison told The Sun that many prisoners had 'refused to get their hair done by her'.

They added: 'Connelly has been given 
one of the most coveted jobs inside prison. She's been working in the 
prison hair salon and earns a small wage in return.

'But a lot of the girls feel she is living on easy street even though she helped end that poor kid's life.'

The criminal's mother Mary also revealed that her daughter had gained a significant amount of weight while in prison and dyed her hair blonde.

She said: 'She's put on an awful lot of weight and is now 22 stone. She has a double chin and a triple belly.'

Peter Connelly was just 17 months old when he died in his mother's north London flat.

Peter and his three sisters were sharing the four-bedroom house with their mother, her boyfriend  Barker, his paedophile brother Owen and his four children, plus Owen's 15-year-old girlfriend.

Tortured: Baby P suffered a catalogue of abuse and was found to have a snapped back and broken ribs

At the trial, Connelly refused knowing who had caused the injuries to her son.

Haringey Council's failure to investigate his mother's tissue of lies meant Peter and eight other children were left inside their squalid home in North London.

Horrific: Paedophile Steven Barker was jailed for life for his role in Baby Peter's death

Peter suffered a catalogue of horrifying injuries including a broken spine, injured ribs and removed fingernails, which was missed by social service workers.

Three of the children - Peter and two of his siblings - were on Haringey's Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected by their mother.

Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before 17-month-old Peter died from his horrific injuries.

But shockingly none of these professionals realised that two men were living in the house, despite a family support official meeting 6ft 4in Barker during a home visit.

Barker and Owen were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death after he was found in his blood-spattered cot on August 3, 2007.

Barker was given a life sentence for the rape of the two-year-old, with a 20-year minimum.

Connelly admitted allowing her son's death and was also given an indeterminate sentence.

She was refused parole last year.

Both she and Barker are expected to ask for new identities and police protection if they are released, at a potential cost to the taxpayer of more than £1million a year.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We refuse to comment on individual prisoners.'
