More floods are predicted next week as forecasters warn that 48 hours of rain will fall across the country, starting on Wednesday.

The first band of rain is due to arrive in western parts of the UK just after midday tomorrow, bringing more wet weather to Wales, which has been badly affected by storms and flooding already.

It will then move eastwards, making way for a new weather system which will arrive on Wednesday, bringing wet weather to every part of the UK and falling as snow in Scotland and across some northern parts of England.

Evacuated: Dozens of homes were vacated in Chertsey, Surrey, as the floodwaters rose from the burst banks of the River Thames. Some residents left in canoes

More floods are due to hit the UK next week as 48 hours of rain is forecast from Wednesday bringing misery to parts of the country that stay waterlogged

Residents living along the banks of the Thames in Surrey have been told to expect more flooding this weekend as river levels continue to rise

Homeowners in Chertsey have taken to using boats an canoes to navigate some parts of the town after the Thames burst its banks on Wednesday night

That will spell out more misery for parts of Southern England where the Thames has already burst its banks, and across Wiltshire, Hampshire, Dorset, Somerset and the Midlands where rivers are continuing to rise.

The Environment Agency has said those 
living along the lower reaches of the Thames in Surrey should remain 
prepared for further flooding this weekend as water levels continue to 
rise.

It said in a 
statement: 'There is also an ongoing risk of flooding from the Rivers 
Parret in Somerset and the Severn in the Midlands.

'High groundwater levels mean we are 
likely to see continued flooding in areas such as the Somerset levels 
and moors, Dorset and Wiltshire.'

Dozens of people have been evacuated from the town which has been swamped by floodwater as forecasters predict more rain tomorrow

But it added that water levels on the Thames between Lechlade, Gloucestershire, and Reading in Berkshire were beginning to slowly recede - while between Reading and Maidenhead they were stabilising.

However, between Windsor and Chertsey in Surrey levels are still rising, albeit very slowly.

The Thames is expected to stop rising in all parts within the next 24 hours, but it may be some days before the levels are back to normal, it said.

EA teams are continuing to be out in force clearing watercourses, checking and operating mobile defences, issuing warnings, and helping communities with flooding.

The most recent estimates suggest that more than 700 properties have been flooded since the start of the year, but more than 239,000 properties have been protected by flood defences.

Craig Woolhouse, head of flood incident management, said: 'The River Thames is continuing to respond to the recent rainfall.

'Communities along the River Thames in Surrey should remain prepared for further flooding.

'River levels will remain high for the next few days and we urge people keep up to date with the latest flood warnings and take action.

'With so much standing water around, we would also remind people to stay out of flood water and not attempt to walk or drive through it.'

The most recent estimates suggest that more than 700 properties have been flooded since the start of the year, but more than 239,000 properties have been protected by flood defences.

Helen Roberts, a forecaster for the Met Office, said: 'The first band of weather will be pushing though later in the day tomorrow, though this one probably is not going to be heavy or last long so it won't cause too many problems.

'It will be pushing in from the west early to mid afternoon while Eastern parts of the UK the rain won't arrive until after dark.

'There may also be a spell of rain overnight Monday and into Tuesday but it is not looking threatening.

'The latter part of next week, Wednesday and into Thursday, there will be a western front pushing in that will be hanging around for quite a long time.

'The west coast from Scotland to Cornwall will be affected early on Wednesday, while the whole country can expect some wet weather during the course of the day.

'The rain could move away early on Friday morning but it is difficult to predict and it could be around for longer.'

There are currently eighty six flood warnings in place across the UK, with 122 flood alerts, although none have been deemed severe - meaning flooding could lead to a loss of life.

Eight people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in England since the beginning of the Christmas period, with around 550 properties flooded since the new year.

Some 140 properties have been flooded in Wales.

Today it appeared the atrocious weather had claimed another victim after the body of a missing photography student was found.

Harry Martin, 18, left his home in Newton Ferrers, Devon, at noon on January 2 to go out to take pictures of stormy seas.

Showers are predicted tomorrow and Monday in Wales which has already been badly affected by storms, while things settle down on Tuesday before more rain arrives on Wednesday

There are currently 86 flood warnings in place across the country including 122 flooding alerts, though none serious enough to pose a risk to life

Temperatures are expected to be cold again overnight tonight but will remain abut average for the time of year for the rest of the week

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed a body had been found in the sea by coastguards.

In Aberystwyth today hundreds of people volunteered to help with a clean-up of the promenade this morning. The community effort, which took place over three-and-a-half hours, was to tidy up the landmark a week after it was damaged by storms.

Councillor Ceredig Davies, who represents central Aberystwyth, said: 'There were just over 200 people there. We used buckets and spades and wheelbarrows to put the sand back from the promenade, where it was washed in the storms.

Coastguards in Devon and Cornwall have confirmed they have found a body in the ocean, believed to be that of missing photography student Harry Martin, 18, from Newton Ferrers

'There were thousands of tonnes of sand there and the volume shifted by people today was hundreds of tonnes. It was great community spirit. It was back-breaking work but everyone felt that they had achieved something.

'They felt like they were doing their bit in putting our promenade back to how we like it.'

Temperatures will be cold again overnight tonight, but for most of the country they will remain about average for the time of year into the week ahead.
