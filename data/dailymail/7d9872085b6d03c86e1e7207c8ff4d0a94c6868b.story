Cherie Blair has launched a programme to help connect online mentors with women in developing countries trying to set up a businesses

Pope Francis was right. He recently said that the internet is a gift from God – and I couldn’t agree more. It is hard to imagine life without it.

Available nearly 24-7 on our phones, in our homes, in public libraries, it has become a central part of everyday activities for most here in the UK – a modern necessity.

When my barristers’ chambers first started using computers, I volunteered to teach myself to use the first word processor while I was on maternity leave.

Two years later, I was the chair of the English Bar’s information technology committee, trying to convince my colleagues that access to a computer helped flexible working.

I could do my legal work, not just in my chambers in London, but also when accompanying Tony to his constituency in Durham.

Tony struggled initially, sticking to pen and paper while at No 10. I was jealous because he had a state-of-the-art computer on his desk which he never turned on.

He did not even use a mobile phone when he had the wonderful No 10 switchboard to make his calls for him, which meant that when he stood down as Prime Minister, he was barely able to use his mobile.

Sadly, he has now become a BlackBerry addict, which just goes to show that he still isn’t very up to date with the latest technology.

Today, thanks to the internet, I can work anywhere in the world at times to suit my family demands. I can send emails at midnight, catch up with the day’s news, buy food or books or manage bank accounts – all online.

But to many women in developing countries, the internet is much more than a convenience. It is a crucial lifeline which can mean the difference between success and failure.

This is what Pope Francis was referring to – the ability to use the internet gives access to a whole new world of information and connections that can transform a person’s life.

When I left Downing Street, I thought there must be a way to use the internet to connect women in a meaningful way.

With the help of Google, my foundation developed a programme to connect online mentors with women who are trying to set up businesses in developing countries against the odds.

Men don’t take them seriously.  They have a hard time getting loans. Sometimes they lack the proper business training to succeed.

Meanwhile, they are expected to carry out their household duties and look after  the children.

It can be a very lonely experience, so connecting to someone and being able to talk about these challenges can be a  complete game-changer.

Take Shilpa, a business owner in India. She had an arranged marriage at a young age and a family who  were opposed to her attending university. She persisted and eventually completed a PhD programme in  psychology.

She set up a personality assessment system for businesses but was derided by male colleagues and taken advantage of by suppliers.

Shilpa had good business sense and the right education but it was a very difficult environment to work in and she felt isolated and defeated.

Then we connected her to two mentors – Priya, an engineer and IT consultant with Accenture, one of our first corporate partners providing more than 40 mentors, and Maha, a treasury sales executive with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, where we have more than 100 employees involved in our mentoring programme.

They met for only about two hours a month but those two hours changed Shilpa’s life. With Priya and Maha’s guidance, she was able to improve her website and develop a strategy to obtain clients.

Perhaps most importantly, she gained a newfound self-confidence. The hostility and barriers she faces as a woman doing business in India remain but she now has a support system as she works to overcome them.

And it’s not just Shilpa who is  benefiting. Her son will grow up to see a woman who is successful in business and who has become a role model for other women.

Shilpa is fortunate to have internet access. For others, the infrastructure isn’t always there. Access can be prohibitively expensive – far more than our monthly contracts in the UK.

For developed countries, internet access is about one to two per cent  of monthly household income, but to access the internet in less developed countries, it costs closer to 30 per cent of the average monthly household income.

It is no surprise then that less than a third of the population in developing countries are connected to the internet.

There  are organisations addressing these issues, such as the Alliance For Affordable Internet, a coalition of more than 50 organisations from the public, private and civil society sectors.

Shilpa is one of nearly 1,000 women in more than 50 countries we have mentored online.

The impact is far reaching – research shows that women tend to reinvest their profits back into their families and communities so the more we  connect women worldwide, the better the world will be.

As Pope Francis said: ‘It is not enough to be a passerby on the digital highways.’ Technology gives us the ability to give life-changing support with just a few hours of our time.

I admit I have become a bit of a techie; always wanting the latest technology and lucky enough to be able to get it. But the internet is more than just gadgets.

We can use it to stretch out a hand across the virtual world to help some really great women improve their lives and the lives of those around them.
