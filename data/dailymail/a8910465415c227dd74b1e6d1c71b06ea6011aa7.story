Craig Dawson scored a late own goal to see West Brom lose 3-2 to Port Vale at Vale Park.

The Baggies have now lost their last three consecutive pre-season games, including defeats to Nottingham Forest and a Hednesford Albion XI, with the start of the season only days away.

Kemar Roofe got the Premier League side off to a quickfire start after being sent through by Craig Gardner to score the opening goal with only five minutes gone. 

Doh! Craig Dawson scored a late own goal to see West Brom beaten 3-2 by Port Vale

Victor Anichebe and Andre Wisdom both spurned decent opportunities to double West Brom's lead before Port Vale equalised against the run of play through a header from Ben Williamson. 

The home side then took the lead only minutes later when Tom Pope rose highest to head home Michael Connor's free-kick.

Academy graduate Bradley Garmston brought West Brom level after the interval with a superb individual effort that beats the Port vale keeper at the near post.

O'Connor almost put the Valiants back into the lead only for his long-distance lob to rebound off the crossbar.

But, Port Vale got their rewards in the dying minutes when Dawson headed into his own net direct from a goal kick.

West Brom play their final pre-season game against FC Porto at the Hawthorns on Saturday August 9.
