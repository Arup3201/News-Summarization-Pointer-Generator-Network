Dozens of children and members of staff at a secondary school in Essex have been treated for chemical inhalation after a GCSE science experiment went wrong.

Ambulances were called to St Mary's Catholic School in Bishop's Stortford this morning after a classroom filled with noxious gasses, apparently after a pupil accidentally overheated a chemical.

At least 33 people received medical attention after complaining of bronchial inflammation following the incident, with two adults and a child taken to hospital for further treatment.

A spokesperson for East of England Ambulance Service said: 'The ambulance service was called to an incident at 11.15am at St Maryâ€™s Catholic School in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire to reports of up to 33 patients complaining of bronchial inflammation due to suspected chemical inhalation.'

'The Trust has a number of resources on scene including the hazardous area response team, two paramedic response cars, two ambulance officers, an ambulance and a community first responder,' they added.

'The first response was on scene in five minutes, with an ambulance being on scene within nine minutes.Two patients have been taken to hospital, both adults with minor conditions. Officers are currently treating those who are still at the scene, with seven patients with minor complaints,' the statement went on to say.

Speaking to the Hertfordshire and Essex Observer, Emmanuel Bonich, assistant head at St Maryâ€™s, confirmed the cause was an experiment and said the classroom was evacuated and ventilated as soon as the chemical substance was noticed.

He said: 'It was a science experiment. As part of the experiment one of the chemicals was heated for too long by one of the students and resulted in some gas being released. The classroom was evacuated and ventilated.'

He added: 'We immediately called for the assistance of the emergency services. Every single class member was given a check over, as were members of staff. So far everyone has been given the OK.'

'Two members of staff have gone to hospital as a precaution and for further checks and a parent has taken a pupil to hospital for further checks.'

In 2009, 48 St Mary's Catholic School pupils escaped uninjured after a school bus caught fire on the busy A414 road near Hadhams.

Older students were forced to help younger pupils get off the bus after it burst into flames.

At the time parents said they had been complaining about health and safety issues surrounding the school bus for months, but nothing had been done.
