A Chinese city has introduced 'lactation rooms' on its public buses for women who want to breastfeed.

The specially-designed seats are being rolled out on the public bus system in Zhengzhou.

The semi-private seats are curtain-enclosed areas which the mother and her new-born can sit in, away from the glare of other passengers.

Bizarre: A Chinese city has introduced 'lactation rooms' on its public buses for women who want to breastfeed

They have emerged following campaigns in China this year to promote breastfeeding and increase the number of public spaces for women.

Despite health authorities in China agreeing on the benefits of breastfeeding, the rate of breastfeeding for children under the age of 6 months is just 28 per cent.

The issues of breastfeeding in China is steeped in controversy with the argument against wrapped in layers of traditional beliefs and misconceptions.

Earlier this year, UNICEF launched a campaign to promote the use of public spaces for breastfeeding.

Because of a lack of public facilities to accommodate breastfeeding mothers, there is a very small proportion of mothers who understand the advantages of it.Â 

Through the campaign, it is hoped that more public spaces can be found and used.

As reported by China.org, mothers in China recently called for employers to provide private locations at worksites to allow them to pump their breast milk.

Breastfeeding is said to promote health for both mother and infant and helps to prevent disease.

It has also been associated with better mental health through childhood and into adolescence.

Artificial feeding is said to be associated with more deaths from diarrhea in infants in both developing and developed countries.
