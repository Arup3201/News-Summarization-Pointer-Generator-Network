Supermarkets have vowed to add more fruit and vegetables to microwaveable ready meals as the Government steps up its battle to get Britain to eat more healthily.

Fruit and veg sections will also be expanded and arranged 'more attractively' in a bit to entice people who normally avoid the fresh produce aisle to healthy living.

Supermarkets have vowed to add more fruit and vegetables to microwaveable ready meals as the government tries to get Britain to eat more healthily

It comes after it was revealed that fewer than a third of adults and only one in 10 children are eating their recommended five-a-day of fruit and vegetables.

A recent poll also showed  23 per cent of Britons think chips count as vegetables, while almost half think the same of roast potatoes.

The move will see supermarkets such as Iceland, Aldi and Lidl include more 'child friendly' displays with 'fun cartoon characters'.

And Subway will launch a new campaign fronted by athletes Louis Smith and Anthony Ogogo for low-fat and salad options.

Eating five portions of fruit and veg a 
day helps to lower the risk of serious health problems, such as heart 
disease, and some cancers.

It is also credited with lowering the risk of obesity.

It is part of the Department of Health's Responsibility Deal which works with large businesses to improve Britain's public health.

Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said:  'It’s vital that we focus particular 
attention on encouraging those who currently consume very little to 
boost their intake. 

'Research shows that fruit and veg intake ‘tracks’ 
through childhood and adolescence, so healthy school lunches with at 
least two portions of fruit or vegetables are really important to give 
children the opportunity to experience fruit and vegetables from an 
early age, and to see other children and adults around them enjoying 
these foods.'

The 16 leading supermarkets, food manufacturers and trade bodies, that have signed up to the pledge include Aldi, Co-operative Food, Iceland, Lidl, Morrisons, M&S, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, General Mills, Mars, caterers 3663, Brakes, CH & Co Catering, Subway and the British Frozen Food Federation.

Aldi will increase the amount of store space dedicated to fresh produce and Lidl will rebrand its entire fruit and vegetable range making it more appealing, particularly for children – with 'fun characters and jokes on kids packs'.

Waitrose is training hundreds of staff to become 'fruit and vegetable specialists' offering in store advice to customers.

And Iceland has pledged to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables included in packaged meals with low cost frozen options.

The move comes as a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 people for Sainsbury's revealed that 23 per cent of Britons think chips count as vegetables, while almost half think the same of roast potatoes.

Just over one-third said they did not have time to eat the recommended amount of fresh fruit and vegetable and a fifth said they were too expensive.
