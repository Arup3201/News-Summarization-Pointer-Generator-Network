Three senior judges yesterday slapped down campaigners who tried to stop library closures.

The appeal judges said it was ‘fanciful’ to claim that shutting six North London libraries would disadvantage Asian communities.

The decision means Brent Council can go ahead with its plan to close down the libraries in the teeth of the campaign fronted by celebrity authors and a string of pop stars.

It will also influence the attitude of judges towards other local campaigns to save libraries and prevent cutbacks by councils.

In recent weeks decisions by two councils to make cuts in social care spending have been overturned by High Court judges.

In another case a High Court judge ruled that Gloucestershire council could not close libraries because to do so would disadvantage minority groups and break its ‘equality duties’.

Earlier this month Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge expressed frustration at the enthusiasm of some of his colleagues for interfering with local council decisions, saying that ‘we have to be careful to remember that we can’t administer the responsibilities which others have.’

Brent campaigners were supported by 
celebrities including children’s author Philip Pullman and playwright 
Alan Bennett, and pop stars JLS, Depeche Mode, Nick Cave, the Pet Shop 
Boys and Goldfrapp.

Their lawyers said that the borough had ‘failed to have due regard to the risk of indirect discrimination against Asian residents’.

Nearly half the library borrowers are Asian, they said.

They also said the borough was not providing an efficient library service as provided by law and had informed people of its plans too late.

But Lord Justice Pill said in yesterday’s decision that Brent had acted properly in making cuts and ‘the decision to do so followed Government and local decisions properly taken, decisions which were primarily for democratically elected bodies.’

He added: ‘It is fanciful to suggest, taking the best view one can of the evidence, that it was so obvious that library provision, as distinct from other services, had discriminatory effects upon the Asian community.’

Lord Justice Pill added: Given the scale of the spending reductions the council was required to make, a decision that the library service should bear a share of the reduction was not, in my judgement, unlawful.’

Campaigners said they were thinking of taking their case to the Supreme Court.

Their solicitor, John Halford, of law 
firm Bindmans, said: ‘The Court of Appeal ruling is very difficult to 
reconcile with what Parliament intended when it enacted the equality 
duty that obliges Brent, and all other local authorities, to properly 
grapple with the impact withdrawal of local services of this kind has on
communities.

‘The Court of Appeal appears to accept that there is a risk of indirect discrimination against significant numbers of people in Brent resulting from its plans to impose devastating cuts on local library services, but it has excused the council from properly taking that risk into account before deciding to make those cuts.

‘Our position is that this is simply wrong in principle. 

'If the Supreme Court is willing to hear this case, we anticipate the outcome being very different.’

Margaret Bailey of campaign group SOS Brent Libraries said: ‘Our legal team presented compelling evidence of damage to communities from Brent Council’s library closures, so we are disappointed that the appeal judges have not found in our favour.

‘Closing half of our libraries has had a devastating effect on the most vulnerable members of our community, among them children and families, the elderly, the disabled and those unemployed or on low incomes.

Brent has always had the means to keep these libraries open, it just lacks the will. The overwhelming strength of public feeling over the last year shows that communities need, want and will support local libraries.’
