This week The One Show presenter Alex Jones is taking on the task of scaling a 1,200ft high mountain in Utah.

The Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park is infamous in climbing circles for its difficulty. It will take Alex two-and-a-half days to ascend and at night she must (attempt to) sleep dangled from the sandstone rock face in a mini tent.

She won't be able to wash, go to the toilet without tubing or rest for long on the gruelling climb which challenges even the most advanced climbers.

Toppled by nature: Alex stands in front of a coconut tree which hangs in the twisted steel roof of a school destroyed by the typhoon

Still smiling: Alex meets children who survived the tropical cyclone last year

Devastation: Alex looks at a ruined building that was once a school

Lives destroyed in an instant: Homes and businesses were wiped out by the natural disaster

Alex, 36, admits she'd only climbed a ladder, and maybe a tree as a child, before taking on this ordeal. So just what made her agree to take on the arduous climb?

She was inspired following a trip earlier this year to the Philippines to see how money raised by Sport Relief is helping people whose lives were destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan.

The tropical cyclone killed thousands of people and left many survivors homeless after it tore through  South East Asia last November.

Alex travelled to Tacloban, the Filipino city worst hit by the typhoon, to witness the destruction first hand.

Homeless: Alex with Delia and her daughters outside of the cramped structure in which they have been living since their homes we swept away

Rebuilding: The presenter helped with a project to create new homes

Silver lining: The wood from coconut tress felled by the natural disaster can be used to make new homes

Where the money goes: The building is made possible thanks to support from charities

She told MailOnline: 'Amongst all the devastation and 
destruction that the Typhoon Haiyan left in its wake, perhaps the most 
visually striking is the coconut trees which were felled.

'As we arrived the number of these 
giant trees which had been ripped from the ground by the combined force 
of the wind and storm surge wave that fateful day in November began to 
hit home.

'A nearby school roof had been crushed by an 80 foot 
tree which was still suspended there. Other classrooms looked like a 
bomb site - even reinforced concrete walls had been ripped apart.'

While Alex was shocked by the devastation but was further alarmed when she learnt of the human suffering the typhoon caused. Many farmed had replied on the uprooted trees for a living so now had no source of income.

Getting stuck in: Alex was happy to help with the house building

New start: Delia and her family will be able to move into a more comfortable wooden home

Other families had their entire lives wiped out by the force of nature.

Alex explains: 'I was introduced to Delia and her two 
beautiful daughters, Fatima, 14, and Salvacion, 10. The typhoon hit 
almost a year to the day after Delia had lost her husband to illness and
 their house didn't stand a chance â€“ washed away, along with everything 
they owned, in an instant. An entire lifetime's worth of possessions, 
care and love just gone.'

She added: 'Since then the family have lived in a 
makeshift tent-cum-shack cobbled together with corrugated iron sheets 
they found strewn around.

'Inside, conditions are indescribably awful. 
Supplies they have managed to get from the relief effort take up most of
 the meagre space and the three of them are forced to sleep curled up in
 a ball.'

But thanks to the way Sport Relief is helping aid agencies like Oxfam and Save The Children, Delia and her family have now been given a new home that Alex helped to build.

She said: 'The only positive to be gleaned from the 30million trees that were damaged or destroyed was that, with so many homes obliterated too, these fallen giants provide a 
ready supply of lumber for the rebuilding programme.'

Challenging climb: Alex is currently in Utah and begins her ascent today after a few practise runs, right

Precarious: At night, Alex will sleep in this suspended bed

Delia's new home was created using freshly cut timber from one of the uprooted trees. Alex picked up a hammer and attempted to make herself useful where she could but left the majority of the work to the experts.

She said it was heartwarming to see how much the new structure meant to Delia and her daughters.

'As their new home began to take shape the excitement and emotion on Delia and her girl's faces was plain to see and as soon as the roof was on they began to move what possessions they had in,' she said.

'To see the transformation in a single day was astonishing. Life won't be easy for Delia and her family of course, and in time they will need a more permanent, stronger home than this, but compared to where they had spent their lives since the typhoon it was heaven and the joy they felt as they moved in was written all over their faces.'

After seeing how money donated to charity has made such a difference, Alex is now determined to raise as much money as she can through her mountain challenge.

She said she'll keep the plight of those like Delia was in mind when the going gets tough.

She said: 'It's sometimes easy to wonder if the money given in the wake of huge natural disasters like Haiyan ends up where you want it to. It doesn't get more tangible or useful than what I witnessed through chainsaws, nails, wood and expertise coming together to make the world of difference.

'The trouble is that there are plenty more families waiting for that kind of miracle to happen to them, which is why I've chosen to dangle from the edge of a rock face - hope my climbing skills are a bit better than my DIY ones!'
