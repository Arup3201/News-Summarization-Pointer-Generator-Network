St Paul’s Cathedral is to reopen tomorrow, a week after it closed because of anti-capitalist protesters – but its dome and galleries will remain shut.

Church officials did a U-turn after locking the cathedral doors for the first time since the Blitz as the number of tents in the ramshackle camp in its churchyard doubled to 200.

The move came as the Corporation of London announced that it is about to begin legal action to evict the demonstrators.

The decision to shut St Paul’s last Friday is believed to have cost the cathedral more than £100,000 in lost tourist revenue.

Officials blamed it on health and safety concerns caused by the camp, which included fire hazards and the spread of rats because of poor hygiene among the demonstrators.

But the Dean of St Paul’s, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, said yesterday that the crypt and ground floor areas should reopen tomorrow afternoon after protesters agreed to move tents near one of the entrances back by 10ft, which cleared fire escape routes.

Do not pass go: Protesters have been whiling away the hours playing monopoly outside St Paul's Cathedral

He said: ‘The staff here have been working flat out with the police, fire brigade and health and safety officers to try to ensure that we have confidence in the safety of our worshippers, visitors and staff which will allow us to reopen.

Being a full-time protester might sound exciting but day-to-day it can get, well, a bit dull. 

So
to pass the time demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral have 
acquired a giant Monopoly board to help them wile away the
hours.

It is believed that street artist Banksy is behind the art installation at the Occupy London movement's camp who delivered it to the protest as a gift.

The
three dimensional depiction of the famous board includes Mr Money Bags begging with his top hat and the playing pieces include a sports car 
to represent the bankers.

The board also includes names of places where other Occupy protests are being hosted.

In
addition there is a red plastic house adorned with the Tox tag which could 
represent toxic mortgage lending which triggered the financial meltdown 
in Britain, or it might be a reference to recently convicted graffiti artist

'We have wide statutory obligations to
ensure the safety of our staff, congregation, visitors and pilgrims and
final checks will be made tomorrow.

'A
passageway allowing evacuation procedures to be improved has been 
created; the kitchen providing food for those in the camp has been moved
from close proximity to the building; bicycles chained to the railings 
have been shifted and a clear pathway restored.'

But he said that ‘for the time being’ the
galleries and 365ft high dome will remain closed because large fire 
engines would still struggle to get to St Paul’s in an emergency, a 
decision which is likely to continue to hit the cathedral’s tourist 
trade.

He
added: 'We will revisit the risk assessment in the light of any 
overnight developments and subject to us getting the green light we hope
to reopen in time for the 1230 Eucharist on Friday to which everyone is
welcome.'

‘We reiterate our basic belief in the
right to protest as well as requesting that those living in the tents 
now leave the site peacefully.

'We want the site to be fully open to 
members of the public to have open access over the area as well as for 
those wanting to visit St Paul's.

'The
mission of the cathedral is committed to the Christian Gospel message 
of justice, dignity and peace. The debate about social justice and 
economic policy will remain at the heart of the work of the St Paul's 
Institute.'

The board has large scale models of playing pieces, including a sports car (to represent bankers) and a red plastic house with a Tox tag sprayed onto it to represent the toxic mortgages that started the recession

The decision to attempt to reopen the Cathedral comes after the Bishop of London called on the protesters to leave.

Richard
Chartres, the third most senior cleric in the Church of England, said 
in a statement: 'The time has come for the protesters to leave, before 
the camp's presence threatens to eclipse entirely the issues that it was
set up to address.

'The 
Dean and the Chapter, who are responsible for St Paul's, have already 
made clear that the protest should come to an end and I fully support 
that view.'

The closure 
of St Paul’s descended into farce after the Mail revealed that the camp 
was made up of part-time protesters and is virtually deserted at night.

Right Rev Knowles said he was optimistic that the Cathedral would reopen following changes to the layout of tents used by anti-capitalist protesters

There
had been growing calls for it to reopen after visitors noted that the 
camp was not blocking the steps to its main entrance.

The Corporation of London said it expected to announce plans for legal action to evict the protesters following a meeting tomorrow.

St Paul’s declined to comment on whether it would join the legal action, but the corporation has always said it would not start court proceedings alone because the camp straddles land belonging to both groups.

The cathedral was last closed in September 1940 – for four days – after a time-delayed Luftwaffe bomb crashed through its south-west tower.

Yesterday Dennis Pinfold, believed to be the last remaining member of the bomb disposal team that cleared the device, called for the protesters to leave the site.

Mr Pinfold, 90, from Leicestershire, said: ‘I believe in the right to peaceful protest, but I also believe in respect and I do not believe these protesters are showing it.’

The former Royal Engineer was just 19 when he took part in the operation which saved the cathedral from obliteration. ‘I can’t pretend it wasn’t frightening,’ he said.

After deactivating the bomb, the team took it to Hackney Marshes where it was detonated, leaving a 100ft crater.

Naomi Colvin, an Occupy London Stock 
Exchange spokeswoman, said: 'The overriding principle is a civil 
liberties one. The right to protest and participate in politics in a 
free society is sacrosanct.

'We
are very keen to work with St Paul's and the Corporation of London to 
address their concerns. The channels of communication from our 
perspective are always open.

'It
would be a shame if the Corporation of London were to launch legal 
action against a democratic and entirely peaceful protest when it's 
entirely unnecessary.

'We 
are concerned that any move to evict us could be the result of a 
political decision not related to health and safety and that would be 
very worrying.'

John Cooper 
QC, who has previously been shortlisted for Human Rights Barrister of 
the Year by campaign group Justice, said he would defend the protesters 
free of charge in any legal action.
