This tiny terrier is Britain's ballsiest dog because of his uncanny ability to sniff out hundreds of old balls whenever he goes for walkies.

Waffle the Lakeland terrier has sniffed out a massive pile of old footballs, tennis balls and beach balls from bushes and grass verges over the years.

The clever dog drags each one back to bemused owner Sarah Bennett, who now has an entire garden full of his trophies.

Waffle collected so many balls his owner urged strangers to donate a pound every time he found one

Sarah, of Exeter, Devon, decided to use Waffle's ball skills to raise cash for animal welfare and urged strangers to donate a pound every time he finds one.

She has so far raised more £2,000 for the charity SOS Terrier Rescue.

Sarah said: 'What started as a little bit of fun between friends, has now grown.

'We've now created an entire page so all the very generous donations can be collected together.

'This way we can keep track of exactly how much money we raise in order to help the little terriers who are not as fortunate as our own beloved pets.'
