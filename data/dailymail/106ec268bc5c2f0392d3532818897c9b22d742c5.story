As her confidante and devoted personal assistant for more than three decades, Cynthia ‘Crawfie’ Crawford was not forgotten in Margaret Thatcher’s will.

The former Prime Minister left 76-year-old Mrs Crawford a tax-free £50,000 and ‘my flower brooch with emeralds and ruby diamonds’.

Baroness Thatcher, who died last April, left an estate of almost £4.7million before inheritance tax. It is understood that this is after paying around £750,000 towards the cost of her funeral.

Devoted to the end: Cynthia Crawford with Lady Thatcher in 2005

Apart from the bequest to Mrs Crawford, and after paying £1.7million inheritance tax, the remaining £3million or so has been split between her children and grandchildren.

Her son Mark and daughter Carol receive a third each. The remaining third was left equally to grandchildren Michael, 24, and Amanda, 19, once they reach the age of 25. The bequest to Mrs Crawford was included in an amendment Lady Thatcher made to her will in 2003.

The same amendment said that Amanda - who impressed mourners with a flawless reading during Lady Thatcher’s funeral service at St Paul’s Cathedral - should also receive ‘free of inheritance tax’ her grandmother’s ‘tiger brooch with sapphire’.

Last night Mrs Crawford, who began working for Lady Thatcher in 1978 and still saw her regularly in her final years, spoke of her ‘pride’ at being given her long-time friend and employer’s ‘beautiful’ basket-shaped, floral brooch.

Speaking from her home overlooking the Malvern Hills around Worcester, she said: ‘It is very kind and thoughtful of her and it will be treasured forever.’ Affectionately known as ‘Crawfie’ by Lady Thatcher, she spoke of her immense grief following her dear friend’s death.

‘My relationship with Lady Thatcher was very close,’ she said. ‘It has been a very hard year and I miss her terribly. I will always remember her with such great affection.’

Lady Thatcher’s health had been deteriorating since last Christmas and she died, aged 87, at the Ritz hotel in London in April after suffering a stroke. Her will was drawn up in 1997 and probate records show she left an estate of £4,694,605.

The will included a tax-free legacy of £1million to her husband Sir Denis - who died aged 88 in 2003 - and stated that everything else should be left in trust and split between twins Mark and Carol, now aged 60, and two grandchildren from Sir Mark’s marriage to his first wife, American Diane Burgdorf, which ended in 2005. Carol has no children.

As Sir Denis died a decade before his wife, it is assumed that the £1million legacy did not take effect and remained part of Lady Thatcher’s estate.

Left-wing critics had predicted that her funeral procession and service would cost £10million, but government figures released in July showed the actual bill for the taxpayer was just £1.2million.

At the time, Downing Street confirmed that Lady Thatcher’s family would be making a contribution and the will states that ‘my funeral and testamentary expenses’ should be paid out of her estate.

Grocer’s daughter Lady Thatcher raised millions of pounds for charity through the Thatcher Foundation, which she set up in 1991.

When she left Downing Street in 1990 her personal fortune was a reputed £9.5million.

In later years she became increasingly frail and suffered from dementia, rarely leaving her Belgravia home. A family friend said yesterday: ‘The bulk of her money was spent on her care.’
