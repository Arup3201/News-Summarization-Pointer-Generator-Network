Arsenal target Kostas Manolas has been left out of Olympiacos' first league game of the season. 

The Gunners have been linked with a £6.5m move for the 23-year-old defender.

And speculation is set to intensify after Manolas was not included in the squad to face Niki Volou tonight.

Arsene Wenger wants to sign a new defender before the transfer deadline following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona.

The Gunners’ need for defensive cover has heightened following a hamstring injury to Kieran Gibbs that will rule him out for the next three weeks.

And Arsenal's defence looked far from secure in the 2-2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park. 

As  revealed last Wednesday, Manolas is a strong contender to fill the vacancy left by Vermaelen.

And Arsenal are pushing hard to complete a deal by September 1.

Impressive: Calum Chambers has looked assured at the centre of the defence since signing from Southampton

The North London club believe Olympiakos will sell their highly-rated defender, who played for Greece during the World Cup.

But doubts linger over whether Manolas is prepared to sign for the Gunners without the guarantee of regular first team football.

Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny - who is nursing an Achilles injury - are Wenger’s first-choice central defensive pairing and Calum Chambers has been employed in the middle since his summer transfer from Southampton. 

The level of Manolas’ first-team chances appears to be the key stumbling block towards the completion of a deal.

But the Gunners are growing increasingly confident a deal can be reached.

Determined: Manolas sticks close to Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck in pre-season
