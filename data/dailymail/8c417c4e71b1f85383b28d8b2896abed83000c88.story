Soccer clubs have been banned from using associating themselves with nations, religions of political organisations to ensure the sport remains popular.

The new regulations, outlined in the Football Federation's  National Club Identity Policy, state that club's names and logos can not 'carry any ethnic, national, political, racial or religious connotations either in isolation or combination.'

This means no references are allowed in: 'words or letters in English, and/or references to the broader geographic area in which the club is located; and/or colours; and/or references to flora; and/or references to fauna'.

The Football Federation Australia's National Club Identity Policy, released on Thursday, said club's names and logos can't 'carry any ethnic, national, political, racial or religious connotations'

FFA boss David Gallop said the new policy was would ensure soccer remained an inclusive but successfully multicultural sport.

'Football is now a part of the mainstream of Australian society and has achieved that status while also retaining its rich diversity,' Mr Gallop said.

'The intent of the National Club Identity Policy is to ensure the game remains inclusive and accessible, not just in the way we organise ourselves, but in how we engage with the community.

Sydney's Fairfield-based Marconi Stallions (left) and Sydney United, formally known as Croatia Sydney (right) are two teams which have a strong history of migration amongst their players 

'The very name and logo of a club sends a message about what that club stands for. We want clubs that stand for uniting people through the joy of football.'

However the policy was greeted with criticism across social media, with Tweeters suggesting that the new rule is ironically avoiding multiculturalism by banning national association.

'FFA want to be "inclusive" by banning anything with ethnic connotations? That's not inclusivity, that's xenophobia,' Andy Cussen Tweeted.

'Unbelievable stuff from FFA. Ethnic clubs in this country represent so much more than just a football team,' another tweeter, Lucas Pavlidis, wrote.

Concerns have been raised for teams with strong histories of migration, such as Sydney's Fairfield-based Marconi Stallions who mostly have Italian heritage, as well as Sydney United who were formally known as Croatia Sydney.

Despite reassurance from FFA that the policy will only affect new clubs and not the names and logos of long-standing members, any revisions made by current clubs are expected to be subject to the new rules.
