Case drags on: Race hate cleric Abu Hamza is fighting an extradition bid to the U.S

European human rights judges are costing the British taxpayer millions of pounds by stalling the extradition of six of the world’s most wanted Islamist terror suspects.

The independent panel that has been reviewing extradition laws will today accuse the European Court of Human Rights of being inefficient and slow.

The six terror suspects – who include hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza – have been languishing in British jails for a combined total of almost 50 years.

The cost to the taxpayer of their incarceration alone is an estimated £2.5million. They are accused of running terror training camps, plotting atrocities and running extremist websites.

But the controversial European court has halted their extradition to the U.S. in case their human rights are breached by lengthy jail sentences. The court has allowed their cases to drag on for years.

Campaigners point to the stark difference between the way the court has dealt with terror suspects and its treatment of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon.

Gary, who searched NASA computers from his North London home looking for evidence of ‘little green men’, is facing extradition to the U.S. on computer hacking charges.

Nick Clegg has broken a lot of promises, but it is the Liberal Democrat leader’s failure to honour his pledge to fight for Gary McKinnon that many people find most appalling.

In opposition he claimed to be one of Gary's biggest supporters but fast forward to 2010 when he was lording it over the country as Deputy Prime Minister and he said the case has nothing to do with him.

Shamefully, he even refused to meet with Gary’s mum, Janis Sharp, to discuss the case, writes JAMES SLACK.

But the European judges dismissed his appeal against extradition in little more than a day.

Gary’s extradition, under the Extradition Act, is the subject of the Daily Mail’s ‘An Affront to British Justice’ campaign.

It was temporarily halted by Home Secretary Theresa May last year. She wants to examine advice on whether the 45-year-old is fit to be sent abroad.

Today the review panel, established by the Home Office and led by Lord Justice Scott Baker, will urge ministers to put pressure on the Strasbourg court to reform the way it works.

In particular, it wants cases to be dealt with much more quickly.

The Government, which has been embroiled in a long row with the court over votes for prisoners, will jump at the chance to issue a rebuke to the judges over terror.

The Mail has learnt that the six cases involve terror suspects that the U.S. is desperate to put on trial.

They
include hate-preacher Abu Hamza and his trusted lieutenant Haroon Aswat
– who are wanted by the U.S. authorities for allegedly plotting to set 
up a jihad training camp in Oregon.

Hamza’s case alone has already cost the public purse £1.1million in legal aid.

He was jailed for seven years in February 2006 for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque in North London.

He
would be eligible for release but remains in jail while his extradition
case continues. If Strasbourg rules definitively that he cannot be 
extradited, officials would have little option but to release him on to 
Britain’s streets.

Two 
other men, Baba Ahmad and Seyla Ahsan, are accused of conspiracy to 
commit terrorist atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups.

They have been held in British jails – at a cost of £50,000 each per year – for between five and seven years while they fight extradition on human rights grounds.

Another man, Khalid al-Fawwaz, who is considered one of the U.S.’s most wanted terror suspects, has been in jail here since 1999.

Allegedly an associate of Osama Bin Laden, he was arrested over bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies in East Africa which killed more than 200 in 1998.

The sixth man, Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings and has been held in prison for 13 years.

All have exhausted their rights of appeal in UK courts and are being held in high-security detention.

The European court has stalled extradition on the grounds that the lengthy jail terms they face if convicted may breach their human rights.

Last night Gary’s mother, Janis Sharp, told the Mail: ‘We appealed to the European court one night and the next day they refused to consider it. It was literally rejected overnight.

‘This treaty [the Extradition Act] was meant for terrorists but it is not being applied to terrorists and it’s not terrorists being extradited. All this treaty is doing is uprooting vulnerable people, like Gary. It’s appalling.’
