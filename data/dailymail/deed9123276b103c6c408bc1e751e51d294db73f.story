Satellite images have uncovered the building where Navy SEALs practiced the mission to kill Osama bin Laden - and the similarities of that structure to the actual compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, is shocking.

The training facility was constructed on U.S. soil to prepare members of Navy SEAL Team Six for what was to be a daunting mission that resulted in bin Laden's death last year.

But the details of the training facility, including its location, were never released - until now.

Spitting image: The training facility, which appears in this satellite image, was constructed on U.S. soil to prepare members of Navy SEAL Team Six for the daunting mission that resulted in bin Laden's death

Terror house: The training facility is remarkably similar to the actual bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan

The pictures, unveiled by whistleblower site Cryptome.org, show a bird’s eye view of the site in North Carolina, near the CIA’s Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity facility in Perquimans County.

When compared with satellite images of the actual bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the two structures - though thousands of miles away - look remarkably similar.

So how did Cryptome’s mapwatchers know where to look? They needed only to peek into the pages of No Easy Day, the first-hand account of the bin Laden raid by one of the Team Six members who was there.

When looking at the same area in North Carolina on Google Maps, however, there is no trace of the building, which was apparently demolished - just like its Pakistan twin - after the mission.

Gone: The bin Laden compound was demolished shortly after the Navy SEAL raid that led to the terror leader's demise

What facility? The training compound can be seen similarly demolished after it served its purpose

Uncovered: Matt Bissonnette's No Easy Day revealed that the CIA training facility was located somewhere in North Carolina

No Easy Day was written by a soldier identifying himself as Mark Owen, but was later outed as retired Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette.

He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

Bissonnette's book has proved controversial because Bissonnette did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it.

It also disagrees with the official White House version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the Obama administration consternation.

Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this 
compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad 
compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the 
Situation Room of the White House

Bin Laden was killed by the commandos who had orchestrated a late night raid on May 1, 2011.

A film about the operation, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19.

Republicans chided the White House earlier this year amid reports that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal - who both won Academy Awards for The Hurt Locker - were given unprecedented access to classified information.

The Obama administration has denied those claims.
