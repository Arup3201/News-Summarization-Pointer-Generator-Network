Toyota Motor Corp. has been found liable for a fatal crash and is ordered to pay $1.5 million compensation to Jean Bookout, 82, the driver injured in the crash, and $1.5 million to the family of Barbara Schwarz, 70, who died.

An Oklahoma judge said yesterday that the settlement to 
award punitive damages was reached in a case that blamed sudden 
acceleration in a Toyota Camry for a wrongful death in 2007.

The jury also decided that Toyota acted with 'reckless disregard' for the rights of others.

Oklahoma County District Judge Patricia Parrish said today that jurors won't be deliberating additional punitive damages.

The judge didn't disclose the amount of punitive damages awarded, which is still being discussed in the courtroom.

The judge has barred the parties from discussing the case publicly until the trial's conclusion.

Toyota
said in a statement: 'Per the court's instructions, we cannot comment 
on the ruling pending the ongoing deliberations by the jury.'

Bookout
was driving the 2005 Camry in 2007 when it accelerated, leading it to 
drive through an intersection and slam into an embankment in Eufaula, 
Oklahoma.

A defect in 
the car's electronic throttle-control system led to the car accelerating
unexpectedly, Bookout and Schwarz's lawyers claimed.

Attorney
Cole Portis told the jury: 'We believe Toyota's conduct from the time 
the electronic throttle-control system was developed has been shameful.

'It's a big deal because if it doesn't work right, people get killed', CBS News reported.

The Japanese car maker denied claims and instead blamed the driver for the crash.

Toyota's lawyer Randolph Bibb Jr. said: 'Sometimes people make mistakes while driving cars.'

He argued that Bookout probably pumped the accelerator instead of the brake by mistake.

In 2012, Toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a legal case involving unintended acceleration problems in its vehicles.

The car maker said the deal would resolve hundreds of lawsuits from Toyota owners who said the value of their cars and trucks plummeted after a series of recalls stemming from claims the firm's vehicles accelerated unintentionally.

Steve Berman, a lawyer representing Toyota owners, said the settlement was the largest in U.S. history involving automobile defects.

Toyota has recalled more than 14 million vehicles worldwide due to acceleration problems.

Toyota Motor Corp's shares fell 0.4 per cent on October 18, in light of more recalls to fix a problem in air conditioning condensers.

The company recalled 885,000 Camry, Avalon and Venza vehicles worldwide.
