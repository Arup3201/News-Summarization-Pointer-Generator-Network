Trust in the Tories to control Britain's borders has halved in the four years since David Cameron promised to cut net migration to under 100,000, dramatic polling data shows.

In 2010 almost half of voters (47 per cent) said the Tories had the best policies on immigration and asylum, but the figure has slumped to just 21 per cent. 

It comes as the Prime Minister finalises a major speech outlining another crackdown on EU migration, in which he will be forced to admit he has broken his promise to keep net migration to the tens of thousands.

Analysis of polling by YouGov shows how the proportion of people who say the Tories would handle immigration best has tumbled from 47 per cent in May 2010 to just 21 per cent this month 

Prime Minister David Cameron is preparing to give a major speech on tackling immigration from the European Union, in which he will be forced to admit he has not met the promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.

Mr Cameron pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s. In 2011, he said this would happen by 2015, ‘no ifs, no buts’.

But quarterly figures due to be released on Thursday are set to show that net immigration is still above 240,000 a year.

The YouGov polling shows just one in five (21 per cent) think the Tories are best placed to deal with immigration and asylum, down from 47 per cent in May 2010.

Only 16 per cent backed Labour, down one point, and just five per cent backed the Lib Dems, down nine points.

At the same time, suppport for 'other' parties has risen sharply, up 21 points to 27 per cent.

The bulk of these voters are likely to be switching to Ukip, which has made major gains in the polls by putting immigration at the heart of its pitch to the electorate.

The latest data from YouGov also shows 25 per cent of people most trust Ukip leader Nigel Farage to tackle immigration, ahead of Mr Cameron on 19 per cent.

Mr Cameron knows he must persuade voters he has a deliverable plan to deal with immigration in order to lure them back from the Ukip fold. 

He is understood to be considering banning EU migrants from receiving in-work benefits, such as tax credits. About 250,000 are thought to receive the income top-ups, costing £1.6billion a year.

But leading Tory Ken Clarke said this would be ‘totally discriminatory’.

‘You have an Englishman working alongside a Pole doing the same job, they both pay the same taxes . . . and the Englishman gets the tax credit and the Pole doesn’t,’ he said.

Eurosceptic Tory MPs stepped up pressure on the PM today, demanding he set a course for Britain to leave the EU altogether. 

Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, proposed that Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty – the mechanism for an EU exit, which has never been used before.

It would legally compel the EU to negotiate the terms for a British exit within two years.

If all 27 other EU countries approved a new deal for Britain, it could be put to voters in a referendum in 2017 – otherwise we would leave, he will say.

Downing Street insisted that the missed net migration target remains the 'objective' to which the Prime Minister is working, as he finalises his major speech.

However, Home Secretary Theresa May has admitted it is 'unlikely' that the net migration target would be met before the general election in May, and said the government had been 'blown off course' by the Eurozone crisis.

Mrs May has until now insisted the Government could meet its pledge to slash migration to below 100,000 by the next election

Two weeks ago, Mrs May called the pledge a ‘comment’ and an ‘aim’ rather than a ‘promise’.

And on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday she went even further.

Pointing out that levels of non-EU immigration are now similar to at the end of the 1990s, she said: ‘But it is, of course, unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament.

‘Why is that? It’s because we have seen increasing numbers of people coming from across Europe, partly because our economy is doing better than other economies in Europe.’

She added that free movement was ‘one of those key issues that we are going to negotiate on, adding: ‘This is an issue that we see as centre stage but increasingly is seen by other countries as an issue they need to address.’ 

Net migration to Britain has returned to levels last seen under the Labour government when a quarter of a million more migrants were moving to Britain than leaving every year

However, today Number 10 insisted the Prime Minister had not abandoned his target and still hoped it could be met.

'It very much remains the objective towards which he is working and the reasons why remain the same,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 

'That's why he has not changed his view, it is the right approach.'

The government has already taken action to tackle bogus colleges, employing illegal immigrants and introducing exit checks.

'In terms of whether or not more needs to be done, we know that that is the PM's view,' the spokesman added. 

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Tory pledge was ‘in tatters’, adding: ‘Continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system.’ Keith Vaz, the head of the home affairs select committee, said that migration policy was ‘a mess’.
