The road to success for athletes is rarely a straightforward one. None more so than in the case of Paralympic sprinter Sally Brown, who is still aiming for glory in Rio 2016 despite an injury-ravaged past three years.

The 19-year-old is taking an unconventional route to the top, picking up a part-time job in a supermarket to help make ends meet.

While her contemporaries are focusing everything on training to get into peak condition, she is juggling athletics with working 12 hours per week in Sainsbury’s.

Brown is targeting success at the 2016 Paralympic games in Rio but has a number of obstacles to overcome

Injuries have led to her losing her funding, meaning she has got a part-time job at a supermarket

From struggling with foot injuries to having her appendix out last year, Brown has been left frustrated and unable to compete with any consistency.

It has cost her the funding to train and race. Brown had not competed enough to warrant funding last season and was just returning from injury and ready to get back on it this year when it was reallocated in November, only for stress fractures in her feet to rule her out again.

She had dipped into savings to fund her past year, training in Loughborough and completing AS Levels in photography and art. But that money soon dried up.

‘I needed to get a job after the summer, I realised when I pulled out of the European Championships there was no chance of getting back on the funding,’ said Brown (left).

‘I had to run a fast time, which I was planning on doing at the Europeans. If my feet hadn’t played up I was confident of doing that.

‘I knew it wasn’t going to happen. I sat down with my parents and figured out what I was going to do. They’re not rich, so they didn’t have money to help me. So I got a job in Sainsbury’s. They’ve been really good. I told them I was an athlete and they said I can work when I want.’

Running is all Brown has ever known and all she ever wanted to do, but, for this year at least, while rehabilitating from her latest injury then training hard to hone her technique in the 100m and 400m, she will also have to stack shelves and man tills.

Brown is determined not to let her loss of funding hold her back from competing in Rio

‘I was really nervous before my first shift, I was terrified,’ she admitted. ‘I’ve never had a job before because I’ve always just run. Last year I had all my funding saved, but all that saving was gone.

‘If I get back on it — when I get back on it — I’ll be more grateful for it. The next opportunity will be November next year, so I’ve got a year to get through.’

Brown is not letting this latest in a long line of setbacks stand in the way of her ambition to race and win medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

She remains confident of being able to compete at the highest level, provided she can finally get fit and then stay fit. But she is doing it the hard way. ‘It’s really difficult,’ she added. ‘At this point it’s when I’d need funding the most with all the rehab.’

Brown is being helped through it all by boyfriend Jonnie Peacock — the T44 100m London Paralympic gold medal winner — and by their new puppy.

In September the pair moved in together in a terraced house just outside Loughborough, where they train, and added a third member to their family.

‘We got a little puppy called Luna,’ said Brown. ‘She’s a French bulldog. I’ve grown up and always had dogs.

‘We don’t talk about athletics at home! I love running and athletics but it’s the last thing we want to talk about when we get home from training.’
