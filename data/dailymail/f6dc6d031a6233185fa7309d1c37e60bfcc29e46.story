While many children her age were enjoying running around, 19-month-old Campbell Pruden was begging her parents to carry her, screaming that her legs felt 'too tight'.

The little girl, who is now three, has since been diagnosed with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis - and has revealed her astonishing bravery as she battles the painful condition.

At times she has taken as many as eight medications and now receives  intravenous injections of powerful immune-suppressant medicines that keep her in hospital in Phoenix for up to five hours.

She calls the procedures her 'stupid tubes' as she often gets tangled in the IV lines while trying to play like any child her age.

Little Campbell is just one of the 300,000 children in the country suffering from arthritis - which many people mistakenly believe only affects adults.

Fighter: Campbell Pruden, now three, was 19-months-old when she was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis

Her parents, Kim, who is pregnant with twins, and John, who hasÂ a fundraising page for the cause, first noticed something was wrong when the toddler developed a limp and refused to walk in 2011.

'In the beginning when there were all those unknowns, we knew we had to get to the bottom of it,' her mother told ABC News. 'But at the same time, we had to keep that poker face with her to give her the confidence that, "You are O.K. and you are going to be O.K."'

As well as the medications, they manage the condition with her diet - by keeping her of red meat and dairy as part of an anti-inflammation diet - and encourage her to take part in physical activities.

'We keep her moving, we keep her 
active and we take one day at a time,' she said. 'When she is not 
feeling well, we respect that, but it's important not to make that a 
crutch or an excuse.'

Arthritis is a term for many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis.

While many believe it only affects adults, more than 300,000 
children in the U.S. are living with the disease, according to 
the Arthritis Foundation - making it one of the most common childhood diseases in the U.S.

Juvenile arthritis is caused by the body attacking its own healthy cells, causing the joints to become inflamed.

Children with the condition suffer swollen joints, the tightening of soft
 tissue and bone erosion that affects or stops growth. Inflammation can also affect 
the spleen or the membranes covering the lungs and heart.

Many forms 
of arthritis can cause irreversible joint damage if they are not recognized early enough. Once diagnosed, children can be treated with therapy or medications, and are encouraged to stay active.

They said their little 'trooper' enjoys taking hikes with them and 'wants to do everything we do'.

Her mother added that while symptoms often appear to subside, she will battle the condition for the rest of her life.

The family said they now aim to raise awareness of the condition, hopeful that people will realize it is not just adults who suffer from arthritis.

'These children live 
in pain every day and can't even wake up and go to school because of the
 pain in their body,' Kim said. 'We need to find a cure, to find a way for these 
kids to lead strong, happy lives.'

Another family battling with the condition is the Schultz family, who live in Charleston, South Carolina.

Five-year-old Amelia and her little sister Liberty, three, both have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which affects their joints 'from head to toe,' their mother, Lisa, told ABC.

Amelia was diagnosed just before she turned two after she stopped walking and began crawling. She would scream during diaper changes and 'her knees were the size of oranges', her mother said.

Her little sister also developed the condition when she was just 15 months old

Strong: The Schultz family, whose son does not have the condition, said the girls have improved with medication

'One day in the tub I saw that one knee 
was way bigger than the other knee, but I thought there is no way 
possible I would have two kids with it,' Lisa said.

The couple's seven-year-old son does not appear to be affected by the condition.

But like Campbell, the girls are battling the condition with positivity and medications that suppress the inflammatory response from arthritis.

More than 300,000 children in the United States are living with arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
