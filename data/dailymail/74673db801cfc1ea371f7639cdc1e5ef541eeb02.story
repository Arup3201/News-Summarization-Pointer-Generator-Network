Even when goal-line technology and an inspired goalkeeper were working in their favour, QPR just could not quite get a break.

Did they deserve one? Almost certainly not on the balance of a game where one side had noticeably higher ambitions than the other. Did Rob Green deserve more? Definitely.

He was simply magnificent, a barrier that Swansea could not knock down for 78 minutes. And then, just like that, it was seven away defeats from seven trips.

Ki Sung-Yueng broke the heart, going outside Nedum Onuoha and firing in off the post, and Wayne Routledge kicked dirt in their eyes with a low finish from the edge of the area five minutes later.

It was cruel on only one man - a goalkeeper with a green shirt and a red face. 

But Harry Redknapp could hardly argue as he weighed up the worst possible yield from a run of away games against top-half opposition.

‘We have had hard games,’ he said. ‘We caught Newcastle on the back of their five-game winning run, and we went to Chelsea and Tottenham and Manchester United.

‘They have not been easy. You only have to look at the table – the teams that have come up have (to make) a big step up.’

Predictably, Garry Monk carried a happier disposition. He said: ‘Some of Rob Green’s saves were fantastic. He probably didn’t deserve to be on the losing side.

‘But for me that was our most complete performance.’

Green’s impact on that performance was felt almost immediately. He smothered Routledge after the winger was clean through after three minutes and then blocked Kyle Bartley’s header moments later.

When Gylfi Sigurdsson had a shot deflected off Joey Barton, it was Green who scrambled across his line to keep it out. 

When Sigurdsson had a free-kick on the edge of the box towards the end of the period, it was Green who acrobatically kept the sheet clean, albeit with the help of goal-line technology. The ball was almost entirely over the line.

For Swansea, it was looking like deja vu after battering Crystal Palace on Saturday and only taking a point.

Monk said: ‘The message at half time was to keep moving the ball quickly and if we continue to create hopefully we will take one or two. Thankfully we were able to do that.’

For 78 minutes here, including two fine second-half saves by Green to deny Bony, there was no breaking through. 

Then the resistance broke. It was no less than each side deserved, barring one man.

The loss to Swansea puts QPR just one point ahead of Leicester (above) on the bottom of the Premier League. Meanwhile, Gary Monk's Swansea (right) move one spot off next season's Europa League and ahead of Arsenal, who play on Wednesday.
