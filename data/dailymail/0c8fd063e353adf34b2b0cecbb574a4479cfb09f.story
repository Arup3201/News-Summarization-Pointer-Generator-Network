David Beckham geared up for this summer's World Cup in Brazil, by exploring the country's Amazon for a special BBC documentary.

The former England captain visited the South American nation with friends earlier this year to shoot the programme in the tropical rainforest.

The 39-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid star explored the Amazon by bike, after having enjoyed the Carnival and play football on the beach.

Guided by locals, the star visited the tiny community of Angelin, crossed the river Negro to the 
banks of the Cuieras River and traveled deep into the rainforest to meet
 the remote Yanomami tribe.

The first pictures to emerge of Beckham in the Amazon show him sporting a red bandana and giving a young local boy a piggyback.

Dressed in a simple white T-shirt and black trousers, the footballer shows his fatherly side and looks quite at home playing with the youngster.

The second
 shot shows Beckham posing by his motorbike. The black and white image 
looks much moodier, with Beckham wearing dirty jeans as he poses by the 
bike, which is caked in mud.

The picture shows a tiny pathway plunging into the depths of the Amazon, highlighting how remote the star had to go to make the documentary.

Set to air in June, just ahead of the World Cup, the programme was made with world-renowned filmmaker Anthony Mandler.

The
 90-minute programme follows Beckham as he flies 5,000 miles from London
 to South America, staying briefly in Rio de Janeiro and then on to 
Manaus in the heart of the rainforest.Â

 arriving at the airport to a bevvy of female fans, the star - who 
carried all his own luggage - retreated to the Fasano hotel in Ipanema 
Beach, known as the most stylish hotel in Rio.

He was in town initially to film a motorbike commercial, but then went on to Manaus to start work on the documentary.
