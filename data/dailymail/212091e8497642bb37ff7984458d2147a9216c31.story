Many grumble about not being able to get a seat on the train to work.

But if they think that's bad, they should spare a thought for the Venezuelan commute - where passengers squash themselves into carriages and leap over seats in an attempt to get inside the carriage.

A short video captures the chaos that comes with catching the metro in the city of Caracas in the South American country.

Calm before the storm: The metro is quiet, peaceful and empty - for now 

As the doors gently slide open, people are already pushing their way in as they race to get a spot

Every man for himself! People fall into the carriage as they are shoved from behind from panicking commuters

The doors slide open, people swarm inside and flailing limbs get tangled up as commuters struggle to push inside.

As the doors glide open, passengers fall in, such is the swell of people trying to push themselves on - despite the doors not even being open.

People rush in, with a couple of limber customers managing to leap over seats.

Few manage to dive on to a bench - but pay the price as they are then subject to kicks in the head as people throw themselves over the chairs. 

Passengers leap over seats in the race to grab a spot, while others swing round poles to land themselves a seat

In a matter of seconds the carriage is already bursting with commuters - but there is still room for more as people dive in

As the panic to secure a space on the metro intensifies, people push others out of the way to squeeze like sardines inside the metro

One person clutches the back of their skull after being kicked by another passenger who uses a pole to lift themselves over a chair... and ends up dragging their feet over other commuters' skulls.

The empty carriage is immediately filled by the rush of people who race in, with some people running down the aisle to try and secure a space.

And forget chivalry - it's every person for themselves as young and old fight for a spot on the service.

The astonishing video, from Tagnana, shows just how cramped the carriages are as people rush to squeeze into.

But it's not only Venezuela that suffers from crowded services.

As soon as the doors open, a flood of people bursts in, with commuters trying to claim a seat before the train starts moving

The cramped conditions were filmed in a short video, which shows just how manic the rush hour can be

What a commute! The crazy scenes showed just desperate people are to cram their way on to the metro

Rush hour has never looked so stressful! By the end the carriage is absolutely packed with people

The squeeze is reminiscent of how condensed the public transport in Japan is.

The metro service in Tokyo is famous for being tightly packed. The city is known for its urban density and so the public transport nightmare is hardly surprising

Packed like sardines into sweaty, claustrophobic carriages, passengers can barely breathe let alone move about freely.

Indian trains are also known for their cramped conditions.

Passengers will swarm on to the unreserved class carriages and sleep in the luggage racks, sit on top of the train roofs and hang off the doors.
