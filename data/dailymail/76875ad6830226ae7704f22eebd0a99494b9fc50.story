A Chinese couple who can't afford live-saving medical treatment for their sick daughter are trying to sell their son on the street to raise money for her chemotherapy.

Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that with certain death awaiting their daughter unless she receives medical treatment, she and her husband were prepared to sell their daughter's twin brother to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, in China's eastern Shandong province, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

The 29-year-old claims she and her husband love both their children, but they are willing to sell their son (pictured together) to a good home in order to try and save the life of his twin sister

The boy's twin sister (pictured with Xiangyan) is suffering from leukemia and requires life-saving treatment

In the pictures, he can be seen eating what appears to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appeals for someone to come forward and buy him.

She said: 'Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

'But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives.

'It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.'

Medical staff say the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10sqm flat close to where the chemotherapy is being carried out.

They are struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

Their attempt to sell their son follows a similar situation last month in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's £10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband Zhou Xinggui are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'
