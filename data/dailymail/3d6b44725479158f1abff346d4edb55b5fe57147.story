A much-loved one-eyed bear will replace last year's Simon the Ogre in a new advert for Thomson as part of its 'Discover Your Smile' campaign.

The ad tells the story of a much-loved bear called Miles who has been ground down by everyday life and is stuck in a routine. 

Miles is noticeably missing a smile as he’s stuffed into a bag by his owner and arrives at a Thomson resort in Jamaica where gradually his smile is restored.  

Is this the real life? 'Miles' changes from a bedraggled teddy in a humdrum existence to a bear with a smile

Is it just fantasy? Taken everywhere by his loving owner, the bear starts to enjoy his holiday as soon they arrive

Set to William Shatner’s tongue-in-cheek version of Queen's iconic Bohemian Rhapsody, the 60 second film will debut on TV during ITV’s X Factor this Saturday and will also be shown in cinemas across the country from Friday.

The advert has the same 'feelgood factor' as last Christmas' hugely popular John Lewis advert featuring a bear and a hare, with the full version of Thomson's ad showing the bear in a toy's own version of a holiday romance.

Little highs, little lows: The bear's frenetic urban existence is a far cry from the holiday he is about to go on

'The new campaign builds on the success of the award-winning Simon the Ogre, which introduced the premise that a Thomson holiday has the power to transform you back to the best version of yourself,' said Jeremy Ellis, marketing and digital director at Thomson.

'The story of Miles the Bear brings that sentiment to life, powerfully introducing Discover Your Smile.'

No escape from reality: The William Shatner cover of Queen's classic ballad fits the story well

All smiles: Miles will go on sale before Christmas

Miles the bear will soon be able for purchase in Thomson retail stores, with a percentage of the proceeds going to the Family Holiday Association, a charity which provides short breaks in the UK for children and their families who suffer from hardship.

Trevor Beattie, founding partner of ad agency BMB, which was also behind the award-winning Simon the Ogre campaign, said: 'We think Miles the Bear is going to be a star. 

'One-eyed and raggedy he maybe, but he’s out to steal your heart.

'And if William Shatner’s version of Bohemian Rhapsody doesn’t put a smile on your face, nothing will.'

A 30 second version of the advert will be broadcast throughout September and October and return to the TV screen at Christmas.

Thomson also hinted that follow ups to the story, in which the bear meets a fellow toy, a beautiful pink unicorn at the end of the holiday, are due to follow in the New Year.
