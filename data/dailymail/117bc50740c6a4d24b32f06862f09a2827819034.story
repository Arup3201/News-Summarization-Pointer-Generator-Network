Chinese Kazakh eagle hunters sit on horseback as they travel to a local competition in the mountains of Qinghe County, Xinjiang, northwestern China.

The festival, organised by the local hunting community, is part of an effort to promote and grow traditional hunting practices for new generations in the mountainous region of western China that borders Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia. 

The training and handling of the large birds of prey follows a strict set of ancient rules that Kazakh eagle hunters are preserving for future generations.

The Kazakhs of the Altai mountain range in western Mongolia are the only people that hunt with golden eagles, and today there are around 400 practising falconers.

The tradition of hunting with golden eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Manchuria in northern China around 940AD.

The competition takes place in the mountainous region of western China that borders Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia

To demonstrate their hunting prowess the eagles soar into the air and then chase meat trailed by the men on horses 

The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during the annual festival.

Their hunting prowess is also tested as they chase meat pulled along by the horses. 

Other activities held during the Golden Eagle festival include horse racing, archery and Bushkashi, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback

The festival also sees awards handed out for Best Turned Out Eagle And Owner, Best Eagle At Hunting Prey and Best Eagle At Locating Its Owner From A Distance.

The hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles.

The more extravagant the coat the more respected the hunter is.
