David Beckham is due to arrive in Miami on Friday with local opposition to his proposed Major League Soccer stadium on the waterfront gathering momentum.

Beckham is likely to attend the England game against Honduras on Saturday, but his priority is to do the rounds of political, community and youth soccer groups to sell his case to build a venue next to the Miami Heat basketball stadium.

The Beckham camp are confident the negative public mood will change when they announce their plans in more detail.

Work to do: David Beckham will try and win over public support in Miami when he arrives on Friday

But Beckham will need all his undoubted charm ahead of a referendum in November to persuade the electorate that his project will be totally privately funded and that all he wants from the state is the same tax relief conditions given to other Florida sports franchises plus a fair market price for the land.

Miami voters will be ultra-sceptical after the enormous cost to taxpayers of the Marlins Park baseball stadium. Even the much-needed refurbishments to the Miami Dolphins Sun Life stadium, where England play today, have been delayed over the cost to the public purse.

The largesse of Swiss watchmakers Hublot is extending beyond their making of a limited edition Hodgson King Power 66 watch for the England manager, their World Cup ambassador.

Hodgson’s three lieutenants, Ray Lewington, Gary Neville and Dave Watson, were also presented with their 66 watches by Hodgson’s son Chris, who helped design them, during a barbecue at his home outside Miami.

The daily Gary Cahill video from inside the England camp featured the presenter taking advantage of Joe Hart leaving the door to his hotel room open to surprise him on his return. But Head & Shoulders might be upset that in the footage of Hart’s bathroom there was no sign of their product, which he lucratively endorses.

Axed Manchester United manager David Moyes, who has a holiday home in Florida where he decamped after his Old Trafford departure, has sufficiently recovered from his bruising sacking to have dinner with media critics in Miami.

Club England managing director Adrian Bevington has risen from the FA communications department to the top of the organisation.

Yet Bevington, who has ambitions of becoming a club chief executive, told fcbusiness magazine he believes there is a reluctance to give senior football positions to those with a PR background compared to a marketing, legal or financial one.

Conspicouos by his absence from a Vauxhall media drinks party in Miami was the BBC football commentator Alan Green, especially as the occasion included a presentation to Mike Ingham, his colleague of over two decades, who is retiring after the World Cup.

Green is due to make his own tribute when he hands over the commentary halfway through the first half of the final on July 13.

BT getting it Wright

Ian Wright and Robbie Savage have been signed up by BT Sport to improve their panel of pundits for a second season of live Premier League coverage.

BT are revamping their Saturday schedule for the 2014-15 campaign with a new football preview programme looking forward to the weekend’s fixtures at home and abroad.

New signing: Ian Wright will work for BT Sport next season as a pundit

And the lively duo, who should bring more personality to the BT analysts roster, will be involved in that show as well as pundit duties.

BT are not concerned that Wright and Savage also have roles with ITV and BBC, believing networks sharing talent is the future.

Nike personnel attached to the England party say they are not interested in the written press, preferring social media and not even offering information after the event about a Nike casual wear photoshoot with Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in Miami.

Yet shamelessly, Nike representatives were feeding their faces at  a press bash bankrolled by helpful England sponsors Vauxhall.
