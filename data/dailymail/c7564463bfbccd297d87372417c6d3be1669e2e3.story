A pervert who blackmailed young teenage girls into sending him naked images was today jailed for six years.

Jonathan Murphy, from Wirral, told his victims that if he did not receive the snaps that he would make a personal visit to the U.S. and kidnap them.

The 35-year-old also sent incriminating footage of the girls to their friends, via Facebook in a bid to bolster his threats.

He pleaded guilty to three offences of blackmail and a further 26 offences of downloading and distributing indecent images.

Jonathan Murphy used a pseudo Facebook account to send incriminating videos of his victims to their friends and family

Judge David Fletcher told Murphy, 35, that 'blackmail is one of the most vicious crimes in the calendar of wicked 
offences. It is appalling behaviour, vicious and nasty.'

He added: 'I don’t know if you really 
appreciate the way in which you wrecked the lives of these young girls.'

Murphy, pretending to be a good looking teenager, convinced his victims to reveal parts of their body via a webcam, and having complied, he then used the footage to obtain further images.

He told the sister of one 
13-year-old victim in Massachusetts, who had begged him to stop after bombarding the siblings with Facebook messages, ‘If you trying to prey on my 
conscience, I haven’t got one.’

And after the pair had ignored his demands, he forwarded a video of the younger sibling showing her naked breasts to her mother, friends as well as her school.

He posed as a good-looking teenager on the site BlogTV where he managed to convince girls to send him naked photos

In conversations with other perverts 
on line he referred to his victims as 'cam whores' and it was apparent 
they spent their time searching on websites to capture indecent images 
of girls, he said.

Victim impact statements revealed how 
the 13-year-old had had to have counselling and her personality had 
changed and her confidence shattered.

She lost a lot of friends and had 
to change schools and her frightened sister and mother had also been 
devastated by Murphy’s activities.

Murphy had been using a Facebook 
account under the name of John Reeves but following a joint operation 
between the FBI in Boston, Merseyside Police Abusive Images unit, CEOP 
and Facebook he was identified.

When police raided his home in Rock Ferry, last November, they examined his 
computers and as well as evidence of his blackmailing activity they 
found more than 2,000 indecent photographs and videos of children.

He had been distributing some of the 
disgusting images and chatting to like minded perverts on line, said 
Christopher Hopkins, prosecuting.

Mr Hopkins told Liverpool Crown Court 
that the 13-year-old had innocently chatted on a website called ‘Blog 
TV’ .

Murphy was jailed to six years in jail at Liverpool Crown Court after pleading guilty to three offences of blackmail and a further 26 offences of downloading and distributing indecent images

He requested her and her sister as 
Facebook friends and then 'utterly despicably' sent hundreds of abusive 
and threatening messages to them for three months demanding more such 
images.

The distraught girls refused and 
pretending to be her sent the video footage to her friends and posted a 
link to her school’s website naming her and saying 'I am a whore , I 
strip for money'.

He had uploaded the video to file sharing website and 
it is now in the public domain for ever, said Mr Hopkins.

Judge Fletcher added: 'During the months of August, September 
and October 2010 you caused havoc in the lives of a number of people 
thousands of miles away through your use of the internet to use it to 
target girls, obtaining indecent images and then proceeding to blackmail
them.'

Fragments of conversation retrieved 
from his computer revealed similar behaviour with two other young girls,
including sending an indecent video of one of them to her friend with a
link to a sharing website.

After the hearing Dc Dave Gregson, 
from Merseyside Police Abusive Images Unit said, 'This investigation 
shows that Merseyside Police in conjunction with partner agencies such 
as Facebook, FBI and Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre will 
continue to investigate the online activities of individuals engaged in 
pedophiliac activity on the internet.

'The clear message is that is to
be sent out here is that however someone tries to hid their identity 
they can be found and will be brought to the attention of the courts.'

Paul Wood, defending, said that 
Murphy, who has a previous conviction for nuisance phone calls, accepts 
his behaviour had had grave consequences.

He was ordered to sign the Sex 
Offenders Register for life and the judge made a Sexual Offences 
Prevention Order banning him from unsupervised contact with girls under 
16 and limiting his internet access.
