Sophie Brannan died after she was knocked down in a hit-and-run in Glasgow yesterday evening

An 11-year-old girl has died after she and her friend, 10, were making their way back from the shops and hit by a car, which sped off.

Sophie Brannan was hit by a black Vauxhall Astra in the Maryhill area of Glasgow when it mounted the pavement yesterday evening. 

She had been visiting the nearby shops with her 10-year-old friend and her friend's uncle, who were also mowed down, and rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill in Glasgow.

The driver did not stop at the scene at about 7.40pm on Friday, but the car was later found abandoned in a street close-by.

Sophie died today in hospital, where her friend, who suffered serious head and leg injuries, remains. The 36-year-old man is still being treated at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow.  

Detective Inspector Colin Hailstones said:  'This was an horrific incident. Sophie, her friend and her friend's uncle, had been out to the local shops when the incident happened.

'Sandbank Street and Maryhill Road are very busy and there were a lot of people about - many of whom tried to help at the scene. 

'We have spoken to them and a number of people who were in the area and are currently checking CCTV to identify the person responsible for this dreadful incident which has left her family devastated.'

He added that the driver of the car was described as white, aged between 25 and 35, of medium build and with short shaven hair.  

DI Hailstones added: 'He was wearing a dark coloured jacket, dark denims and white trainers and was last seen running off towards the canal path after abandoning the car in Lochburn Street.

'Somebody out there knows who this person is and I would appeal to them to contact police regarding his whereabouts. 

'I would also say to the man himself to hand himself in - it's only a matter of time before we track him down.'

Detectives and specialist road policing officers are continuing to carry out extensive enquiries, while the road remained closed for most of the day.

Police are urging anyone who may have been travelling in the area at the time or who may have witnessed the incident to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymously.
