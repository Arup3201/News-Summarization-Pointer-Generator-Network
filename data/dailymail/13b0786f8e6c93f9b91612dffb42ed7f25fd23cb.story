Nasa has revealed that astronauts aboard the International Space Station use virtual reality to train for spacewalks.

However, while Facebook's Oculus and Samsung are developing small, hi-tech solutions, Nasa has used the advantage of zero gravity to fashion a more low tech solution.

Instead of a dedicated headset, astronaut Terry Virts posted a picture of the solution - a laptop strapped to his face.

His tweet revealed the system is being used to train astronauts in using a jet pack they use to get back to the station in the event of an incident that left them stranded.

Essentially a 'life jacket' for spacewalks, SAFER is a self-contained maneuvering unit that is worn like a backpack. 

The system relies on small nitrogen-jet thrusters to let an astronaut move around in space.

Its relatively small size and weight allow for convenient storage. 

However, its size was achieved by limiting the amount of propellant SAFER carries, so it can only be used for a limited time.

That is why SAFER is intended primarily for emergency rescue, and not as an alternative to tools such as tethers and safety grips as a means of getting around the station.

EVA crewmembers are required to use SAFER whenever the shuttle is docked to station and unable to fly over to recover a spacewalker who has become un-tethered and can't get back to the airlock.

Astronauts control the SAFER device by using a hand controller attached to the front of their space suits. SAFER's propulsion, which is provided by 24 fixed-position thrusters that expel nitrogen gas, was first tested in 1994 by astronaut Mark Lee outside the Space Shuttle Discovery. 

According to David Homan of Nasa's virtual reality lab, the system is also used to train for spacewalks.

 If an astronaut would drift off, it provides free-flying mobility to return to the spaceship. 

It is worn on spacewalks outside the International Space Station (ISS), and was worn on spacewalks outside the Space Shuttle. 

So far, there has not been an emergency in which it was needed.

All of the space station and orbiter structures are graphically presented in the virtual reality helmets worn by the spacewalking astronauts. 

The structures are also displayed on video screens that simulate the actual camera views that crew members inside the space station or space shuttle would have. 

These views allow crew members to monitor the spacewalk activities as they would in orbit. 

'The same software used in the training facilities on the ground is also used on the laptop computers on the station,' he said.

'The crews in space use the software to review upcoming spacewalks and robotic arm operations before actually performing the tasks. 

'The program is also used on board during robotic operations to provide the arm operator a situational awareness view of the arm while it is in motion. 

'The graphic arms in the program are driven by "real" data from the "real" arms during actual operations to provide the operator with a synthetic bird's-eye view of what's happening outside the station.

'New configuration data can be developed on the ground and uplinked to the computers on board the station at anytime to make sure the crews have the latest station configuration at all times.'

A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits.

Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear. 

The fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a European astronaut's helmet causing a near-drowning.

The first spacewalk by a pair of U.S. astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow, but Nasa today bumped it to Saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation.

The second spacewalk is now Wednesday; the third is March 1. The extensive, outdoor cable-routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017. 

Two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

Engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings, causing them to corrode and seize up.

Both units were returned to Earth on the Dragon capsule last week. Spare units were put in the spacesuits, and those have checked out.

Nasa says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk, but not endanger anyone. 

An unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut's near-drowning in 2013.

Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode.

Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts are the designated spacewalkers. 

The astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station.

The ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017.

The space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before Wilmore leaves the orbiting lab in mid-March.

Private companies SpaceX and Boeing are working on crew capsules — under Nasa contract — to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. 

Nasa lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011, and is paying Russia for crew transportation.

The issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano during a spacewalk in July 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered (shown here in this image from the ISS) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water
