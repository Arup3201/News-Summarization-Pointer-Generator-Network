Guilty: Stephen Pardon was jailed for four months for being in contempt of court

A juror was jailed yesterday for contacting a defendant in a £2million theft trial.

Stephen Pardon, 42, went to the accused's workplace to tell him his fellow jurors had illegally looked up the case on the internet.

Ian Lewis and two other men had been found guilty of one theft charge but the jury was deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict on a second related charge.

The trio have now appealed against their convictions, citing the behaviour of the jury.

If they succeed there is likely to be a re-trial that would cost £1million.

Pardon, who is a lorry driver, had told Lewis that jury members had researched newspaper stories about the case as well as trawling the internet.

He went to the work premises of another defendant, Anthony Geeling, but was unable to speak to him.

Lewis told his lawyers about Pardon's actions and they informed the judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

After he was arrested Pardon told police he had been stupid but was worried about a 'miscarriage of justice' and 'felt sorry' for the accused.

The trial, which ended last December after 13 weeks, concerned a plot to steal £2million of metal.

Pardon, of Tipton, West Midlands, yesterday admitted contempt of court in a case Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred to the High Court  in London.

Passing a four-month prison sentence, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge emphasised the 'seriousness with which this court will view any incident which serves to undermine our system of trial by jury'.

He added: 'This contempt involved deliberate disobedience. In these circumstances an immediate custodial sentence is virtually inevitable.'

Lord Judge told Pardon that he knew 'perfectly well' that he should have voiced his concerns to the trial judge rather than the defendants.

Jonathan Challinor, defending Pardon, said: 'It is right Mr Pardon disobeyed a clear and unambiguous direction from the trial judge.

That was a matter which Mr Pardon candidly and straight-forwardly admitted when interviewed by police.' He added that Pardon had acted in good faith.

Following the hearing, Mr Grieve said: 'There is a compelling public interest in addressing any contempt of judicial process.

'Mr Pardon's conduct had serious consequences and as a result the three convicted defendants appealed against their convictions – convictions won after a lengthy police investigation and trial.'

Lewis, 46, of Stourbridge, West Midlands, Geeling, 62, of Studley, Warwickshire, and David Fellows, 59, of Blakedown, Worcestershire, have asked the Court of Appeal to overturn their convictions.

A fourth defendant was found not guilty of the same theft charge.

The jury was discharged when they could not reach a verdict on a second charge relating to an attempt to steal metal beer kegs.

In January, a university lecturer who researched a defendant's past on the internet was jailed for six months.

Theodora Dallas, 34, turned to the web while trying a man for grievous bodily harm and found he had once been acquitted of rape.

Dallas shared her findings with fellow jurors at Luton Crown Court.
