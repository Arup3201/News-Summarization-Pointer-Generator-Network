A pricey pint: Australian experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer

From rising sea levels to extreme weather ravaging countries and destroying homes, climate change is blamed for a range of undesirable events.

And now Australian experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer - and even change the taste.

It is thought that if the planet gets hotter there will be more frequent droughts to regions that grow grains such as barley, which is a key ingredient in beer.

If barley is in extra demand, the price of it will rise and buying beer will be more expensive as a result, scientists told The Brisbane Times.

In a bid to keep the price of a pint stable, a team of researchers from the University of Queensland are trying to drought-proof barley.

They have identified ‘stay-green’ characteristics in types of barley that were first spotted in another grain called sorghum, which grows in hot places.

Researcher Peter Gous told the newspaper that the discovery could mean a stable supply of carbohydrates for the brewing process.

Climate change could affect the amount
 of starch in barley, pushing the cost of a serving of beer up 
from around $5 (£2.70) to as much as $20 (£11), Mr Gous warned.

‘I'm
 not saying they're the actual values, but the amount of energy and 
water and things that have to go into the brewing process will 
increase,’ he said.

Sorghum is a genus of grasses with about 30 species, one of which is raised for grain.

The plants are cultivated in warm climates worldwide.

One species, Sorghum bicolor, is native to Africa and is an important crop  used for food, fodder alcoholic beverages and biofuels.

Most varieties are drought and heat-tolerant and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is a staple food.

Sorghum bicolor is an important food crop in Africa, Central America and South Asia and is the fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world.

The study, which was published in the Journal of Cereal Science, detailed how a ‘stay-green’ set of genes could be bred into grains to help them deal with drought and maintain their starch structure.

He said: ‘It is a trait that naturally
 occurs, more in wild types of barley like regrowth and things like 
that. So basically breeders have gone back to ancient sources of sorghum
 and reintroduced them, because with conventional breeding eventually 
you lose traits that are beneficial, and drought-proof the plant.’

Farmers
 had bred away from the ‘stay-green’ aspects of the crop in favour of 
focusing purely on yields, so the scientists have re-introduced the traits.

Preserving the pint: Experts explained that selective breeding will benefit brewers, who want the barley grain to have quality of the starch to maintain a consistent flavour as well as farmers who could still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions such as drought (illustrated)

Mr Gous explained that the move could benefit brewers, who want the grain to have quality starch to maintain a consistent flavour, as well as farmers who would still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions.

While Mr Gous could not guarantee to safeguard barley for beer, he said that ‘with certain drought-tolerant traits, you can have a more stable supply of specific quality grain’.

Dr Glen Fox, also at the university, 
said sorghum breeders had long taken advantage of ‘stay-green’ 
characteristics for improved yield and a similar trait in barley could 
present growers with an innovative way of responding to the challenges 
of climate change.

The two plants are distantly related and both evolved in warmer parts of the world.

‘So if we can help growers produce barley that is more in-tune with what industry wants, we’re well on the way to improving productivity and profitability,’ he said.

Each year Australia produces about two million tonnes of malting barley and a good proportion of that is exported throughout Asia and the Pacific.

‘Our team’s research has shown that normal grain development and starch composition can survive significant water and heat stress in selected barley lines,’ he added.
