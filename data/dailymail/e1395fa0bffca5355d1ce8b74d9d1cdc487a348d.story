Mikaela Medina, 14, was swimming in the murky waters off the coast of Galveston, Texas, when a shark sneaked up on her from behind and clamped down on her back.

The Texas teen recalled feeling a 'bump' against her back, but initially experienced no pain.

Medina emerged from the water and asked her mother to take a look at her back, at which point she learned what happened.

'She’s the one who told me I had gotten bit [sic],' Medina told KHOU 11 News. 'After she told me I was bleeding, I started crying.'

Medina's family were spending a weekend on Galveston Island, where they own a beach house, but the girl was the only member of her family who decided to take a dip in the ocean darkened with seaweed.

The 14-year-old said she was attacked by a shark while kneeling down in waist-deep water on West Beach.

The marine predator left clearly visibly puncture wounds on the right side of the girl's upper back before swimming away. 

‘We know about sharks but you never think that something like this could happen to your own daughter so I was kind of in denial at the beginning,’ said Mikaela's mother, Maria Amezaga.

The mother and daughter ran back home, where a doctor friend who was spending the day with the family was able to treat the 14-year-old for her injuries on the spot.

Mikaela Medina said she could never have imagined a shark would attack her, but added that it could have been much worse. 

According to information from the Florida Museum of Natural History, there have been 15 shark attacks in Galveston between 1911 and 2013, among them a single fatality.

Bull sharks are the most common sharks involved in attacks off the coast of Texas.
