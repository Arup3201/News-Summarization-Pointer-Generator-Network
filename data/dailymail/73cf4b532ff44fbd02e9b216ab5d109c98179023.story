Roy Hodgson took the decision to start Raheem Sterling on the bench in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia after he complained he was tired the day before the game.

The Liverpool forward has been heavily criticised for his stance since, but was he entitled to say he was suffering from weary legs?

Sportsmail takes a closer look at the 19-year-old's schedule in the build up to Sunday's clash in Tallinn.

DAY ONE 

Roy Hodgson met his players at St George's in the afternoon and took a light training session for those who had not played on Sunday. Liverpool had played on Saturday.

DAY TWO 

Full training in the morning, the most intense and rigorous session of the week. Short meetings in the afternoon for attackers, midfielders and defenders.

DAY THREE 

Light session at St George's, then a two-and-a-half-hour journey by train to The Grove hotel in Watford. Sports psychiatrist Steve Peters was available to see England players on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Players decided if they wanted to speak to him.

DAY FOUR 

Stroll and stretch in the morning before team meeting and game against San Marino at Wembley. Sterling came off at half-time. Hodgson said afterwards this was to preserve energy for Estonia.

DAY FIVE 

Warm-down session at The Grove in team units, in a large function room with stretching mats and spinning bikes under care of fitness coach Chris Neville.

'We did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training,' said Hodgson.

DAY SIX 

Light session at The Grove. Sterling spoke to Hodgson after the 15-minute warm-up, telling him he was not 100 per cent. He was excused the rest of the session but not ruled out of the team. Three-hour flight to Tallinn and walk round the stadium. Sterling had another chat with Hodgson about his condition.

DAY SEVEN 

Stroll outside the hotel and stretch after breakfast. England stayed in UK time (two hours behind) while in Tallinn. Sterling was named on the bench against Estonia and came on for the last 26 minutes. England flew straight back home after the game, landing in Manchester at just gone midnight.
