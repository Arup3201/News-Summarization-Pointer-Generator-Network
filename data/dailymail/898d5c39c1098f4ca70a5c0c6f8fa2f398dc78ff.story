A boy has been orphaned days before his seventh birthday after his parents died in a murder-suicide at his home.

Police were called to the house of Kristin Batdorf, 43, and Jose Rodriguez-Yera, 47, in Lansing, Michigan, after neighbours heard the six-year-old crying in the street.

Officers believe Rodriguez killed his chiropractor wife before taking his own life.

Police haven't said how the couple died, but neighbours say they heard gunshots at around 1am on Thursday.

The boy was been placed into the custody of Child Protective Services, but was not physically harmed.

One neighbour and friend told WILX 10 that he thought Batdorf had been trying to leave her husband.

Osmany Junco said: 'He called me one day, he told me they were having problems.

'She no wanted to continue with him. I don't know why.'

Other neighbours were surprised the couple might have been having difficulties.

'They were very, very friendly helpful people... always offering to help,' said Jesse Owens.

Another said they 'weren't very vocal or obviously confrontational'.

The Eaton County Prosecutor has taken over the case.
