It's a skill few able-bodied Olympians could pull off.

But despite needing a walking stick for support, British table tennis player David Wetherill produced arguably the shot of the tournament after diving full-stretch to hit this stinging 'superman' winner.

The 22-year-old has since become an internet sensation after a video of the point has been viewed more than two million times in the last few days alone.

On the rack: Later in the point, the 22-year-old is forced wide to the left and faces a return far to his right

Going for it: With no other option, Wetherill lunges across the table in the hope of reaching the ball

Wetherill was playing in a Class 6 match at the ExCel Arena when he was put under pressure by his German opponent Thomasz Kusiak at a crucial moment in the fourth set.

The Paralympics GB player was forced to his left and then made to reach for a ball knocked back to the other side of the table.

With the ball seemingly out of his reach, he leapt across with his arm outstretched and manages to return a fierce passing shot while toppling to the ground.

Do or die: Despite needing a walking stick for support, he shows incredible athleticism as he reaches full-stretch

Contact: Amazingly, and no doubt to his opponent's shock, the ball comes fizzing back across the net

Take that! As Wetherill falls to the floor, the ball flies past the German's flailing bat for an astonishing winner

Sensational: Wetherill looks up to realise his has won the point as the crowd and both coaches go wild

Disappointed: Wetherill (pictured in different matches) ultimately lost the game, but tweeted later that he would be a better player as a result of his experience

As the crowd goes wild, the commentator 
describes the shot as 'ridiculous' a number of times and even had his 
opponent's coaches applauding.

Unfortunately, the world number five's efforts could not prevent a shock defeat to Kusiak, who sealed a 3-1 victory.

He had been expected to move to the later stages after overcoming Italy’s Raimondo Alecci in the first round.

Wetherill, who needs the aid of a crutch to walk due to a rare, genetic bone development disorder, later tweeted his disappointment about not going further in the competition.

Winner: Jeferson Da Conceicao Goncalves of Brazil finds the net against Spain with a sumptuous right-foot shot that many fully-sighted players would be proud of

He said: 'I gave it everything, I'll be a better player for that experience – amazing, can't thank u all enough.

‘At
 least I might get a few YouTube hits, Superman diving forehand winner? I
 practice that I'll have you know #ProudParalympian.’

Wetherill's feat is one of many in what has been a truly inspiring Paralympic Games.

Yesterday,
 the Brazilian blind football team put many fully-sighted players to 
shame with an exquisite array of skills given the obstacles they face.

The defending champions saw off China 1-0 to finish top of Group B in what a repeat of the final at the Beijing Games in 2008.

Victory: Richard Whitehead celebrates after winning gold in the T42 200m having been in last place at one point

Late push: Whitehead made a late surge in the last 100m to clinch victory

Team GB: The 36-year-old double amputee broke his own world record in the process

Other notable achievements include the stunning comeback by runner Richard Whitehead who surged from last place to win an astonishing gold medal for Team GB in the 200m T42 final.

A capacity crowd in the Olympic Stadium roared as the 36-year-old managed fought back in the final 100m before finishing in a new world record time of 24.38 seconds.

Whitehead's achievement is all the more impressive considering he only took up sprinting after he was ruled ineligible from entering his main event, the marathon.

The Nottingham athlete - who was born without lower legs - came storming through down the home straight to win by more than a second in a high quality race in which every single competitor ran at least a personal best.
