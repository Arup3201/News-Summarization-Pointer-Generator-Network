It seems Floyd Mayweather doesn't do understated following his latest uploaded Instagram videos.

The current WBC and WBA Welterweight champion is filmed relaxing at his home with dozens of luggage bags ahead of a flight to Las Vegas to be at the launch of his new business venture.

The undefeated fighter accompanied the 
video with the message 'I got a few of my bags packed, I'm ready to 
travel the world again. #LOUISVUITTON #GUCCI,' in what is taking the 
phrase "travelling light" to a new level.

Widely-regarded as the pound-for-pound king in boxing, Mayweather is currently enjoying time away from the sport following his 46th professional win against Argentina's Marcos Maidana in May.

The victory last month extended his unbeaten record to 46-0 and his break from the ring has included opening up his own store called Devanna Love in the Nevada state, which is depicted in the second video via his Instagram account.

The 37-year-old will return to the ring on September 13 against an unnamed opponent as of yet.

Mayweather was in London for Carl Froch's eighth round stoppage against George Groves in May, and the Wembley Stadium atmosphere is something he admitted he would like to experience before he retires.

'It's been a goal to come to the UK and put on a spectacular event and the plan is to do just that,' he told The Sun.

'I
 love all my fans in the UK and I want to go there and give a good show 
at Wembley before I retire. I plan to come in the near future.

'I want to continue to make history with the mega events we put on.'
