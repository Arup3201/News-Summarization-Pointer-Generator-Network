Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has admitted the dressing room was divided under his predecessor Jose Mourinho at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Mourinho, back at Chelsea for a second spell, was involved in several public spats during his reign in Madrid as tensions flared with the likes of Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and talisman Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ancelotti has now revealed he inherited 'lots of problems' at Real Madrid, but insists there has been nothing but calm since his arrival in 2013.

'Before I arrived I was aware that there were lots of problems in the dressing room – problems between some players and Mourinho,' Ancelotti told So Foot.

'Everything that happened in private would end up in the papers the next day. But when I took charge, everything had returned to calm. I didn't inherit any tensions. 

'Was I responsible for returning peace to the dressing room? No, no. When I arrived there was already a lot of serenity. 

'Ever since I arrived, there hasn't been one fight in the dressing room. I have never had an unmotivated player or any confrontations with players who haven't played as much as they'd want to.'
