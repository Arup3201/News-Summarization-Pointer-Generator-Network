The Department of Public Safety has pulled the 'Don't Jerk and Drive' ads, which played on the double-meaning of the word 'jerk.'

Highway Safety Director Lee Axdahl told the Argus Leader  earlier this week that the double meaning was intentional, to grab people's attention. 

South Dakota officials have canceled a public safety campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of jerking the steering wheel on icy roads, saying it's too risque.

He says the message is that the department would prefer drivers keep their cars out of the ditch and their mind out of the gutter.

But his boss, Public Safety Director Trevor Jones, says he's pulling the social media and television ads.

'I decided to pull the ad,' Jones told the Argus Leader. 'This is an important safety message and I don't want this innuendo to distract from our goal to save lives on the road.'

He says he doesn't want innuendo to distract from the goal of saving lives on the road.

At least 16,000 people have already seen the campaign o Twitter while Facebook page views have gone to almost 30,000.

The double meaning was part of the campaign, to appeal to the young male drivers most likely to crash while driving on icy roads.

Republican Rep. Mike Verchio said he would speak to the campaign's organizers before the transportation committee for an explanation into their thinking.
