Social media experts believe Schoolies looking to meet a match on the Gold Coast this weekend are likely to turn to the dating app Tinder.

Concerned parents have warned their kids against the dating app, which has come under fire in recent months due to its controversial nature and it's ability to let complete strangers view users' personal photos.

The app, which is used by over 10 million dating fanatics, matches users who are in close proximity to each other and allows people to decide whether they find each other attractive based on a select number of Facebook photos. 

This means that Schoolies who are in a crowd on the Gold Coast could take out there phone and potentially swipe through all the Tinder users in the room.

Schoolies week kicked off tonight in Surfers Paradise, with over 20,000 teenagers expected to hit up the popular designated party zone on the beach by 7pm tonight. 

Experts say the apps eliminates any social awkwardness that may be involved in directly talking to either a boy or a girl.

Professionals say Tinder can be used as a conversation starter amongst teens and there should not be a social stigma attached to the online dating tool.

The popular matchmaking mobile phone application can be used by people under the age of 18, however underage users are unable to access the Tinder profiles of people who are over 18.

Tinder offers users the opportunity to interact with people nearby, who have common interests. 

Users then 'swipe left' if they do not think they are a match, or 'swipe right' if they think they are perfect for each other.

Speaking to the Age, Associate Professor Burgess said Tinder's popularity has grown significantly in the last year due to the success of other dating apps.

'We've seen a massive mainstreaming of mobile dating as opposed to online dating, and Tinder has been a huge part of that,' she said. 

Tinder follows in the footsteps of previous dating sites including PlentyOfFish, Match.com and OKcupid.com 

'We talk about 'digital delegation' – Tinder outsources checking age, sourcing pictures and building a profile to Facebook,' Professor Burgess said.

'But you've got to be careful of toolies on Tinder just as you would out in a club.'

The app came under scrutiny recently after Kiwi tourist Warriena Wright fell to her death from the balcony of a Surfers Paradise apartment. 

Ms Wright had met Gable Tostee, a complete stranger, on Tinder just a few hours before her death.
