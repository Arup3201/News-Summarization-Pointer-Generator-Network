Australia have pledged to attack Monty Panesar after batsman Steve Smith insisted their decision to attack Graeme Swann had contributed to the England spinner’s mid-series retirement.

Panesar is poised to take Swann’s place in the fourth Ashes Test, starting at Melbourne on Boxing Day, and Smith said he could expect more of the same after Swann was carted for almost four runs an over in the first three Tests.

‘The best way we play spin as a batting unit is playing quite positively, so I’m sure when Monty comes on to bowl we’re going to look to keep scoring runs and put the pressure back on him,’ said Smith.

On stand by: Monty Panesar is likely to replaced retired spinner Graeme Swann in England's bowling attack in the fourth Test against Australia at the MCG in Melbourne

On the attack: Steve Smith says Australia's batsmen will go after Panesar

Asked whether he felt Australia’s 
policy of getting after Swann had played a part in his decision to quit 
the international game, Smith said: ‘We’ve played him very well this 
series, that’s for sure. If we could attack him, that was our mindset 
from the start, and make their quicks come back sooner than they’d have 
liked to. Yeah, we’ve probably played a big part.

‘Hopefully we can have another big week here and then in Sydney and clean-sweep these guys.’

Panesar,
whose own Test career was in jeopardy during the  summer, found himself
having to defend Swann at the MCG after the retired spinner’s 
ambiguous  parting shot led to a storm which clouded his retirement.

Swann
said in an unprompted aside during a press conference solely for 
English newspaper cricket writers that some players he is  leaving 
behind ‘love themselves too much’ and ‘are up their own backsides’.

Controversial exit: Graeme Swann delivered what some considered to be a parting shot at his team-mates as he announced his immediate retirement on Sunday

It 
was delivered with his trademark cheeky grin, he would not name any 
names and, as one of the seven journalists present, I can confirm that 
it was impossible to know for sure whether he was talking about his own 
team-mates.

We know that 
Swann has never been close to Kevin Pietersen and that the two were on 
different sides during the text scandal that almost caused Pietersen’s 
demise as an England player last year.

Yet on this tour they are said to have been  getting along fine.

And
we also know that England have been angry at some of the more extreme 
sledging from  Australia during this series, in  particular from David 
Warner, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson. Swann later used Twitter to deny 
he was talking about England.

It
was into this storm that  Panesar emerged, with the air of a man who 
was not quite sure what was going on. So Monty, do you all take playing 
for England for granted? ‘Absolutely not,’ he said. ‘We have a hungry 
and very determined dressing room that wants to do really well in these 
last two Tests. Playing for England is the pinnacle for every sportsman.
In no way do we take it for granted.’

Determined: Panesar has had to overcome his own troubles to re-emerge as an England Test player

But
what about what Swann said? ‘It’s the first I’ve heard about it. Swanny
knows who he’s referring to but in terms of the dressing room and his 
team-mates we are right behind him. We loved him to bits when he played 
with us and we all back him as a team. He’s an iconic cricketer, a 
match-winner and one of the best spin bowlers in the  modern game.’

How
about the timing of his retirement mid-series? ‘It’s his decision. He 
knew when he wanted to go and when was the right time. When you lose 
your own hunger for bowling or your passion you know your time is up. We
are all right behind his  decision. He’s done wonderful things for 
England. If I can achieve half of what he’s done I’ll be ecstatic.’

What
of Michael Vaughan, an Ashes- winning England captain, saying this tour
has become a joke? ‘I don’t think that,’ said Panesar. ‘We’ve still got
two Tests to show our hunger and determination.’ But could Swann’s 
comments  tarnish his legacy? ‘He’s done  unbelievable things in the 
last few years for England and he’ll be remembered as one of the 
greats.’

Aussies rule: Peter Siddle, flanked by Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson, warm up for the fourth Test in Melbourne knowing that they have already won the five-match series

It must have come 
as a relief to Panesar when he was asked about his own cricket. He has, 
of course, been England’s top spinner before and, at 31, has the time to
be so again — particularly as the cupboard is not exactly bursting with
young spin-bowling prospects.

‘This
is a really good opportunity,’ said Panesar. ‘I’ve been there in the 
past where I’ve looked too far ahead and suddenly you’re not focused. I 
don’t see myself as the No 1  spinner. I just want to get my  bowling in
good rhythm — better than at Adelaide.’

Panesar
said he thought his  England days were numbered when he was cautioned 
by police over a nightclub incident that led to  accusations he had 
urinated over bouncers. ‘I thought my chance had gone,’ he said. ‘I’m 
lucky to be out here. I want to grab this chance. Last summer’s problems
are behind me. It’s time to move on and play with a smile on my face.’

Just as Swann used to. Only now it’s Monty time again.
