Condemned: Robert Moormann was executed today in Arizona after murdering and dismembering his mother in 1984

A death row inmate was executed today after killing and dismembering his adoptive mother despite last-minute appeals over his mental disabilities.

Just before he was put to death, Robert Henry Moormann used his last words to apologize to his family and to the family of an eight-year-old girl he kidnapped and molested in 1972.

He said: 'I hope this brings closure and they can start healing now.

'I just hope that they will forgive me in time.'

Moormann was the first Arizona inmate to be executed with one lethal drug, as opposed to the state's long-standing, three-drug protocol.

The switch was made after it was realised on Monday that one of the drugs had expired.

It meant Moormann was given only two days' notice of how he would be put to death instead of the official seven days.

Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a request for a stay, the two-member execution team gave the lethal injection to Moormann at 10.23 am. The 63-year-old was pronounced dead at 10.33 am.

Moormann appeared to writhe around more than other inmates executed with the three-drug protocol. And unlike other prisoners, who appeared to fall asleep immediately, Moormann kept his eyes open during the entire execution.

For his last meal he had requested  a double hamburger, french fries, two beef burritos, two 14-oz containers of rocky road ice cream and three RC Colas, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections.

The execution took place just a minute's drive from the Blue Mist Motel, where on January 13, 1984, he beat, stabbed and suffocated his adoptive mother, Roberta (Maude) Moormann, 74. She had sexually abused him into adulthood, according to defense lawyers.

Troubled: Moormann was released from prison for a 72-hour visit when he murdered his mother - he was caught when he asked to dump 'cow guts' in the dumpster of a local pizzeria

Robert Henry Moormann confessed to 
smothering his mother and standing naked in a hotel room, 'dissecting' 
her. He cut off her head, legs and arms, halved her torso and flushed 
all her fingers down the toilet.

Moormann's lawyers claimed the 63-year-old killer was mentally retarded and had the intellect and emotional capacity of a small child.

They argued the attack was provoked by years of sexual abuse by his mother Maude Moormann - even while he was in prison.

Moormann was free from prison on a 72-hour furlough - given to inmates to see family or for conjugal visits. The murder prompted the state to stop its policy of allowing such leave.

He was initially jailed for kidnapping an eight-year-old neighbour and trying to take her to Las Vegas in 1972.

Along the way, he sexually abused her several times in dusty motels. She was found alive after the horrific ordeal and Moormann jailed for kidnapping.

Prosecutors said he wanted to abduct and rape the girl's mother, but lost his nerve and took the child instead, according to the Arizona Republic. 

On the murder of his mother, 
Moormann's lawyers told a different story. They said his mother, the 
widow of a well-known businessman from Flagstaff, had been sexually 
abusing him for years - forcing him to perform sex acts on her.

Maude
was actually Moormann's adoptive mother. His biological mother, a 
15-year-old hard-drinking prostitute, died in a car crash when she was 
17.

Lawyers claimed it was in the midst of a performing a sex act on his mother, aged 72, that Moormann put a pillow over her face to keep her quiet. Once she was dead, he went about meticulously trying to dispose of her body. He put her body on the table of the motel and cut it to pieces.

He then carried the pieces to dumpsters around the town and disposed of them.

Adopted: Moormann killed his adoptive mother Maude. Family members say she was the only person who ever loved him unconditionally

He was caught when he arrived at a local pizzeria and asked if he could dump 'cow guts' in the trash bin behind the business. The suspicious owner called the police.

He also stripped some of his mother's bones of their flesh and packed them in a box. He gave the box to a prison employee and said they were spoiled meat bones for the prison guard dogs.

All of this, the lawyers said, was the result of Moormann's severely diminished mental capacity.

His psychologists, and even fellow prison inmates, have testified that beneath his gruff voice, bald head and over-sized glasses, Moormann has the mental capacity of a small child and still maintains an infantile affect and demeanor.

Moormann's lawyers also cited his difficult early childhood in their defense of the killing.

His mother gave birth to him June 4, 1948 at the age of 15 and his father soon abandoned him. Two years later, his mother, an alcoholic and a prostitute, broke her neck in a car crash and died.

Moormann was passed to his grandparents, though he was soon removed to foster care because his grandfather was an uncontrollable alcoholic. He passed in and out of foster homes before being adopted at the age of two by Henry and Maude Moormann.

Henry was reticent about adopting the child, but Maude's maternal instinct won over and the couple took him in.

The Moormanns were well-known in Flagstaff. Henry ran a taxi service in town. But early on, family members told the Arizona Daily Sun, they saw trouble in Robert.

Grisly crime: Moorman suffocated and dismembered his mother Maude at the Blue Mist Motel a short distance from the state prison where he was officially released for a family visit in 1984

He was classified as mentally retarded in school and given special education classes. When he was 13, he was committed to a state mental hospital after he shot his mother with a .22-caliber rifle.

Moormann claimed he was simply taking the gun out to show it to his mother and that it fired accidentally.

When Henry Moormann died in 1967, Maude clung to her adopted son.

'It's over, it was a horrible crime. The man knew what he was doing. There was no doubt in my mind.'

Tom Rankin, retired police chief who caught Moorman

In 1972 at age 24, Robert Moormann kidnapped an eight-year-old girl next door.

Court testimony indicated he might have been more interested in the child's mother - whom he wanted to rape - but lost his nerve and snatched the girl from school.

Prosecutors alleged that he sexually abused the child as he carted her off to Las Vegas. However, he was never convicted of that crime.

Even after Moormann was jailed, Maude, now elderly, visited her son - taking a bus more than three and a half hours from Flagstaff - three times.

It was on her third visit that Moormann murdered her in the hotel room where they were staying. 

Rex Gilliand, a distant relative of 
Maude, who knew Robert Moormann briefly, said the convicted murderer was
a 'throwaway' child who never got the attention from most of the people
in his life that other kids receive.

'The one person in the whole world who loved him unconditionally, he kills brutally,' Mr Gilliand told the Daily Sun.

Tom Rankin, who was 
Florence's police chief at the time of the killing and interviewed 
Moormann, said he attended the execution to get some 
closure in the case.

Outside the prison today, the former chief said: 'It's over. It was a horrible crime.'

Lock down: Moorman ate a last meal of hamburger, fries and rocky road ice-cream on death row in Arizona

Rankin, who retired from the police department in 1994, rejected arguments from defense attorneys about Moormann being too mentally disabled for the state to legally execute.

He said: 'Those are excuses attorneys try to dig up to save someone's life. It just costs the taxpayers more money. The man knew what he was doing. There was no doubt in my mind.'

Arizona joins Ohio, Texas and several other states that last year made the switch to pentobarbital after the only U.S. manufacturer of execution drug sodium thiopental said it would discontinue production.

In July, the only U.S.-licensed manufacturer of pentobarbital announced that it would put the drug off-limits for executions. And a company that bought the pentobarbital line in December is required to also keep it from use by prisons for executions.

Once states use up their current supplies of pentobarbital, executions could be delayed across the country as officials look for yet another alternative.
