This is the moment an enraged woman was dragged from a flight after hurling abuse at staff and stunned passengers.

The woman can be heard swearing at officers who were asking her to leave US Airways flight 738 as it prepared to take off from Philadelphia in the U.S.

Seconds later she is lifted from her seat and forcibly removed from the jet while shocked passengers, including a number of children, watched on.

Angry: The woman was heard swearing and shouting abuse before police were called on to the flight as it prepared to leave Philadelphia in the U.S.

Scuffle: Police asked the woman to leave herself before she was picked up out of her seat and dragged from the plane

At one point she shouts: 'This is harassment, I didn't do anything wrong!'

She goes on to scream a string of obscenities, making a series of accusations against staff as they hauled her down the central aisle of the plane.

In a video taken by passenger Mike Irving,  a man can be heard surging the woman to 'calm down' before adding: 'Get up now or I will pick you up. Do you want me to pick you up?'

The passenger, who was wearing dark clothes and a cap, then shouts: 'I did nothing wrong, I did not do anything.'

During the struggle that followed she can be heard yelling, 'I'm going to sue you' and 'you're going to lose your job'.

Police were called in after passengers heard her swearing and told flight attendants.

The flight, which was destined for Lisbon in Portugal, was delayed by nearly two hours as the drama unfolded last night. 

Eye witnesses saw being put in handcuffs as she left the flight before she was taken from the airfield in a police car.

Mr Irving (@mikeirvingmusic), who runs the website mikeirvingmedia.com, said: 'She came on the plane yelling and swearing about how we are going to Portugal and not Brazil.

'Overall, you could sense that people didn't feel comfortable around her. She continued being loud and obnoxious and I'm assuming that some of the families with younger children told the flight attendants, who then called the police.

'When the police came, she refused to move, started screaming at them and telling them she would sue, and when they told her she would be arrested if she didn't cooperate that just edged her on more,' said Mr Irving, who runs his own YouTube channel.

US Airways has been contacted for a comment.

The incident came a day after an American Airlines plane flying from Dallas to Boston had to be diverted to Nashville because of a disruptive passenger who allegedly ran towards the plane's cockpit.

The airline said Flight 2214 landed in Nashville at around 9pm on Saturday.

According to police, she ran towards the cockpit of the aircraft and, it is alleged, kicked several officers during her arrest.

Mary Lentz, 55, from New Mexico, was later arrested and charged in connection with the incident.
