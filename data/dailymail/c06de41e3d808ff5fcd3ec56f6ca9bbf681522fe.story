Film buffs won't have to wait for the latest blockbusters to hit Australian cinemas as the nation's largest film distribution companies will fast-track the release most major film titles.

As part of a new strategy by Village Roadshow, movies will be either be shown before, simultaneously or soon after they are screened in the US.

CEO and co-chairman Graham Burke announced the plan on Tuesday, which will drop the traditional release pattern to combat rapidly increasing online piracy.

Blockbuster films such as The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 will hit Australian theatres on November 19 - a day before it's released in the US

Upcoming sci-fi flick Interstellar will be released in the US on November 6 but will fast-tracked to Australia a day before

Films include upcoming sci-fi flick Interstellar on November 6 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 on November 20, both of which will be released one day before the US.

While about four million Australians engage in some form of illegal downloading every month, Mr Burke says it 'makes total sense that when a movie opens and the web is ablaze with chatter that we capitalise on the timeliness and worldwide excitement'.

He admitted that the decision to hold back on the release of The LEGO Movie had been a 'painful' mistake.

'We estimate that (piracy of) The LEGO Movie cost somewhere between $3.5 million and $5m in sales and of course this is straight to the bottom line and the Australian Tax Office,' Mr Burke told The Australian.

'It was doubly painful because Lego was produced in Australia. Piracy not only impacts profits, but if unchecked will ­impede new business models and growth.' 

However he also revealed some titles will be delayed due to school holidays, competitive release patterns and lack of screens, if.com.au reports. 

Lagged releases include The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, due to open in Australia on December 26 - nine days after the US.

Horrible Bosses 2 is scheduled for release on November 23 in the US and December 11 in Australia.
