As thousands flocked to the spot where John F. Kennedy was shot on the 50th anniversary of his death this weekend, just a handful showed up at his assassin's grave - 50 years since he was murdered.

Lee Harvey Oswald was shot dead by Dallas night club owner Jack Ruby on November 24 1963 in what was the first murder shown live on a national U.S. television broadcast.

Just two days earlier Oswald had gunned down the president as he waved to crowds from an open-topped car during a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, in what became one of the most defining moments of the 20th century.

Remembered: At the grave site on Sunday morning, a simple stone marker laid flat in the ground reads 'OSWALD.' There was no first name, no birth date or date of death

At the grave site on Sunday morning, a simple stone marker laid flat in the ground reads 'OSWALD.' There was no first name, no birth date or date of death at his grave in Fort Worth, just west of Dallas.

The threadbare grass surrounding the grave - dotted with a few coins and floral bouquets - had been pressed down by those who visit. Only a few came to see the grave on the anniversary.

It was a stark contrast to the outpouring of emotion seen on Friday as large crowds gathered along the same route 
through Dallas that the president's motorcade passed when shots rang out
on November 22, 1963.

About
5,000 tickets were issued for the free ceremony in Dealey Plaza, which 
is flanked by the Texas School Book Depository building where sniper Lee
Harvey Oswald perched on the sixth floor.

Coming two days after the global media blitz to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the anniversary of Oswald's killing has remained an afterthought.

The former U.S. soldier who had defected to the Soviet Union was 24 years old.

'It completes the story essentially,' said Paul Nixon, who traveled from Britain to attended the memorial for Kennedy in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Friday and has been visiting locations related to the assassination.

Action: Secret Service agent Clint Hill rushed to the back of the limousine and pushed Mrs Kennedy back in the car after she tried to grab a piece of her husband's skull that had flown off

Sparse turnout: Oswald was buried a day after his death in a sparsely attended funeral that included his Russian wife, Marina, his mother and reporters - a few of whom stood in as pallbearers because there were not enough people to carry the casket (pictured)

Many see Oswald a confused loner who changed the fabric of world history and came to the cemetery in a quiet part of Fort Worth as part of their remembrance of Kennedy.

Other visitors see Oswald as a cog in a complex conspiracy to murder the president.

'There are so many theories and nothing is clear,' said Anna Olivares, 43, who traveled from Wisconsin to commemorate the assassination anniversary.

Olivares believes Oswald killed Kennedy, but does not believe he acted alone. Recent surveys show that a majority of Americans think there was a plot to kill Kennedy.

Legacy: John F. Kennedy was the most popular president in the 20th Century, and he was assassinated during a campaign stop in Texas on November 22, 1963

Unexpected: The convertible that the Kennedys were riding in had been equipped with a glass cover but the President felt he was better able to connect with voters without the barrier

'There were no mourners. There were no friends,' Mike Cochran, an AP reporter at the time who served as a pallbearer, told Reuters.

The police officer Oswald shot dead, J.D. Tippit, was buried that day in a different part of Texas.

The state funeral in Washington for Kennedy was also held that Monday as Americans united in grief and watched it on TV.

Soon after the caisson carrying Kennedy's coffin arrived at Arlington National Cemetery, 81 percent of American homes with a television had their sets tuned in, ratings agency Nielsen said.

The spot: A museum now occupies the space that used to be the Texas Book Depository, and this is the window on the sixth floor that was Oswald's hiding spot

Clear shot: Lee Harvey Oswald was positioned in the Sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, (the building on the left) when he fired at the motorcade

Moving on: In preparation for today's celebration, road crews on Thursday repaved the area of Elm Street where the President was shot

Hugh Aynesworth, a former Dallas 
Morning News reporter who witnessed the assassination, Oswald's arrest 
and Oswald's murder, said the fact that Oswald never faced trial fueled 
the speculative fires of many conspiracy theories.

'We
can't accept the fact very comfortably that two nobodies, two nothings -
Oswald and Ruby - were able to change the course of world history,' he 
told Reuters.

Numerous
events were held around Dallas this year to mark the milestone 
anniversary, including panels with those who were there that day, 
special concerts and museum exhibits.

Investigation: There are many conspiracy theories about the assassination, many of which persist today. The official version of events concludes that Oswald acted alone and used this bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight

Heartbreaking: The President's funeral was held on the same day that his son John F. Kennedy Jr turned three, and the little boy is seen here saluting to his father's casket during the funeral

President
John F. Kennedy's last surviving sibling, 85-year-old Jean Kennedy 
Smith, laid a wreath at her brother's grave at Arlington National 
Cemetery outside Washington.

Smith
was accompanied Friday morning by about 10 members of the Kennedy 
family as they marked the 50th anniversary of his assassination in 
Dallas.

They joined hands for a short prayer in silence and left roses at the grave.
