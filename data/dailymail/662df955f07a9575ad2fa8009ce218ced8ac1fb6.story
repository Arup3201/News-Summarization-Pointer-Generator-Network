Bacary Sagna is getting used to his new surroundings at champions Manchester City and began his first day at his new club by getting fitted out for his new suit.

The France defender joined City on a free transfer after leaving Arsenal at the end of last season.

And after a break following the World Cup, Sagna arrived at the club's Carrington training HQ for his first day.

Top of the agenda was being measured for his club suit – which could get its first airing at Sunday’s Community Shield at Wembley against former side Arsenal.

Edin Dzeko – who returned to Manchester after City were knocked out of the International Champions Cup in America – was also being fitted out for his suit at the training ground.

Yaya Toure, Fernandinho and Pablo Zabaleta were also kitted out with the club's formal wear.
