A mother was shocked to find her baby daughter had been clutching one of the UK's most venomous spiders - after her pals identified the arachnid from the photograph she posted on Facebook.

Sadie Perry spotted that her 15-month-old daughter Ava drop the spider onto the carpet and quickly snapped a picture of the creature to upload to the social networking site.

Miss Perry, 27, had laughed off inquisitive daughter's fearlessness as the tot picked up the spider, until her online friends identified it as a false widow.

Although the spiders are not naturally agressive their fangs are capable of piercing flesh and the venom can cause a painful swelling, which in extreme cases and if left untreated can prove fatal.

'I laughed as I was never scared of 
spiders, and my daughter didn't seem too bothered either,' said Miss 
Perry, of Kennington, Kent.

'I hadn't heard any of the spider warnings so I took a picture and uploaded it.

'As I read 36 notifications rolling in on my Facebook, my concerns started to grow.'

Wildlife
expert Owen Leyshon confirmed he was '99% sure' the spider spotted by 
Miss Perry was one of the genus of Steatoda, commonly known as the false
widow.

The species can be identified by it's bulbous abdomen with cream-coloured markings that are often likened to the shape of a skull.

It is one of the few spiders in the UK that can inflict a bite painful to humans.

The species, which has the Latin name 
Steatoda Nobilis, resembles the deadly black widow spider and has been 
blamed for a spate of recent bites across the UK.

One victim was four-year-old Sophie Harris who was bitten by a spider, and to the horror of her mother Amy, 28, sent home from hospital without treatment. 

Ms Harris took Sophie to Shrewsbury 
Royal Hospital, near their home in Baschurch, Shropshire, after the 
wound started to swell last week.

She was told to take her daughter home and give her allergy medication, but as the pain on Sophie’s back intensified, Ms Harris eventually chose to squeeze out the venom herself, which she suspected had 
come from a false widow.

‘When I looked I discovered a lump of black in the middle with yellow around the outside about the size of a 5p piece,’ the mother said.

She said a spider bit her but because she is four and she’s got a wild imagination I didn’t know whether to believe her.

‘I’d read all about these spider bites and showed people on online forums pictures of the wound and they were sure it was a false widow bite.'

A spokesman from Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said staff did not know what had caused Sophie’s injury.

Decorator Ricki Whitmore, 39, almost lost his leg when he suffered a horrific bite from Britain's most poisonous spider after disturbing a nest of false widows while working at a school.

Drastic: Surgeons were forced to slice open Ricki Whitmore's leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size

Surgeons were forced to slice open his leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size.

Mr Whitmore, from Romford in Essex, will now have to undergo six months of specialist physiotherapy and admitted: 'I am just lucky to still have my leg'.

'There was a really sharp pain and then my leg started to throb,' he told the Daily Star.

There are fears that with temperatures outside plummeting as the winter months approach, millions of the spiders could make their way into homes across the country to escape the cold.

Traditionally they were only found in the south of England, but there are nests being found in Wales and Scotland.

Experts believe that the spiders my be thriving in the UK because of a wet start to the summer followed by a heatwave.

Long-term climate change may also be to blame, leading spiders to set up home in new areas.

However, some experts say many sightings of false widows could in fact be the common house spider.

Steve Harris, a 22-year-old  footballer from Devon also needed emergency surgery after a nasty bite from the spider.

He said: 'When I woke up I had a pain in my side - a stinging feeling. I didn't take that much notice until it started swelling and the pain got worse.

'I was in agony. I have never had pain like that before in my life. It's still very painful now. I still can't sleep properly and find it virtually impossible to get in and out of a car.'

Poisonous: The false widow spider

The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

The
Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is 
spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in 
southern England.

This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.

HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

The
key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it 
because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To
avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the
only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the 
four legs.

Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods 
as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has 
crawled in overnight.

If you have a garage store things in 
plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see 
inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
