Stewart Downing has admitted he thought his England career was over before earning a recall by Roy Hodgson.

The West Ham player's last cap came in May 2012 and although he went to that summer's European Championships he failed to get any minutes and has not been close to a call-up since.

But his improved from under Sam Allardyce, sparked by a change in position from wing to midfield, has got him back in the international fold – and he wants to play against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday.

'I've admitted in the past I felt my chance had passed, but I kept going and always kept trying to play well,' said Downing, 30. 'It's paid off. Roy has been watching the games and picked me. I'm very happy to be back.

'There is a lot of new talent coming through. I do feel a bit old. But he's got a good mixture here. I was a little bit nervous coming in. But it's exciting. There is some great talent.

'Every time I watch Raheem Sterling at Liverpool he seems to get better and better. Adam Lallana is someone I've not played with. They've impressed me with some good touches in training.

'The system change has helped (earn a recall). Playing in the middle adds a new dimension and I'm really enjoying it. I've got to continue my good performances and take my chance when given it.'

Downing paid tribute to Allardyce and West Ham as a team. 'Roy has been impressed with how we've adapted to a new way of playing,' he added. 'That's why he's called me up. I need to maintain that form. I spoke to Roy a couple of times. At West Ham games he's been in the changing room with the manager and we spoke very briefly. He said, 'Yes you're going to get in the squad.'

'I'm here to play and perform, not just make the numbers up. I'm itching to get out there.' 

West Ham sit fourth in the table and have beaten Manchester City and Liverpool this season.

Downing hopes the side can stay in the European places but admitted: 'It will obviously be difficult. We have to be realistic. But we've had a great start, which we wanted to do.

'The one we're playing we don't fear anyone and we feel we can beat anyone on our day. That's the attitude we have to take into every game from now until the end of the season.'
