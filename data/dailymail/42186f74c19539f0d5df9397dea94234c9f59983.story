Australia has chosen a state-of-the-art Dutch vessel to help map the Indian Ocean floor as the search for missing flight MH370 heads deeper under water.

Netherlands-based Fugro Survey will assist a Chinese military vessel in surveying the ocean bed as part of the next stage of the quest for the Malaysia Airlines plane which vanished three months ago.

The MV Fugro Equator, which is equipped with a deep water multi-beam echo sounder system, will work with Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhen to complete the mapping ahead of the underwater search by an as-yet undetermined contractor.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is now planning to comb a 60,000 square-kilometre (24,000 square-mile) search zone based on the plane's last satellite communication.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) stated that the survey would provide crucial information to help plan the deep water search for MH370 which is scheduled to begin in August.

‘The bathymetric (ocean floor) survey will provide a map of the underwater search zone, charting the contours, depths and composition of the seafloor in water depths up to 6,000 metres,’ the JACC said.

Fugro said in a statement that it expected its vessel to start mapping in mid-June which was expected to take about three months.

Australia has set aside $90 million to find MH370 - expected to be the most the country has spent in aviation history 

Meanwhile, the Malaysian government has revealed it has spent just a fraction of what Australia has paid in the search for missing flight MH370, as officials from both countries prepare to meet to discuss the next phase of the mission.

But Federal  Treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia will pay its fair share in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

'It is understood that the plane went down in waters that are our responsibility, and there is a cost to having responsibility and we don't shirk that,' he told reporters on Tuesday morning.

'We accept responsibility and will pay for it. We're not a country that begs others for money to do our job.'

Officials from Malaysia are expected in Canberra today for talks, including discussions around funding for the operation.

The Australian government has set aside almost $90 million for the search - expected to be the most expensive in aviation history - but it's possible that figure could increase.

The Federal Government put the $90 million price tag on the search for the first time when it handed down the budget in May.

The budget papers stated the actual cost will depend on a multiple factors, including the outcome of procurement processes for specialist services, the length of the search, and the extent of contributions from other countries.

The head of the joint task force charged with finding MH370, Angus Houston, said on Tuesday discussions around the next phase of the search would include negotiations with Malaysia over the cost of the search.

Malaysia has spent $9.3 million on the search so far and Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said costs of the next phase will be shared  

'The government has allocated $89.9 million. I think about $25 million of that is to go the defence force for the visual search they conducted,' former defence force chief Air Chief Marshal Houston told the ABC.

'There's another $60 million that's been allocated for the underwater search.'

'That money has been allocated but we're still to crunch, or still to negotiate the burden-sharing with for example Malaysia.'

A Joint Agency Coordination Centre spokesperson said via a statement that a full accounting of Australia's search costs to date is 'not available at this stage'.

'However, for transparency the full costs across Australian Government agencies will be compiled at a later date,' the statement said.

'Malaysian, Chinese and Australian officials, including Air Chief Marshal Houston, will meet in Canberra this afternoon to discuss the ongoing search for missing flight MH370 and cost sharing arrangements. 

'Currently, each country bears its own costs.'

But a senior Malaysian government official has already said Australia was expected to share the cost of the next phase, adding there were no figures yet for how much would have to be spent.

'Costs will be shared 50-50 between Malaysia and Australia,' Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said.

The comments came as Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed his government had spent 27.6 million ringgit ($A9.30 million) in fuel and food for equipment and personnel in the search.

'The cost that we had to bear is relatively small compared to the other assets given by other countries used in the search,' Mr Hishammuddin said.

'I am proud that many of our friends have come forward to help in the search, and they bear their own expenses and have not made any claims from us.'

More than three months have passed since the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard - including six Australians.

The Boeing 777 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, but an extensive search has turned up no sign of wreckage.

The Australia Transport Safety Board last week issued a tender to continue the deep-water search for the ill-fated flight.
