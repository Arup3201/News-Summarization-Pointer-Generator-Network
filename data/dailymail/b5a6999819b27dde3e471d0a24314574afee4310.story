The wonderful thing with horses is that they know so little. Coneygree didn’t know he was a novice, didn’t know he was fragile, didn’t know he wasn’t worth anything at all.

He didn’t know a first-timer hadn’t won the Gold Cup since 1974, or that winners of blue riband races are rarely so gauche that they lead from start to finish. And what he didn’t know couldn’t hurt him.

It is different for humans. Sara Bradstock, wife of winning trainer Mark, and daughter of racing legend Lord Oaksey, who bred Coneygree, remembers every doubt, every raised eyebrow, every cruel remark on the road to one of the most remarkable victories in the history of this race. And one in particular.

On November 17, after two years out with injury, Coneygree was withdrawn by a vet at the start of the SIS Live Novices’ Chase at Plumpton. After 660 days off the track injured, the veterinary professional inspecting horses before the race decided Coneygree showed signs of lameness.

‘I said to him, “It’s not just any horse that you’re f****** me about with here”,’ said Mrs Bradstock, with a countryside earthiness that contrived to sound jolly, sporty and bloody furious at the same time. ‘And do you know what he said to me? He said, “He’s had two years off, he’s not worth anything anyway”.’

No doubt there is a vet in the South Downs area of Sussex who is feeling a little sheepish this morning. The diagnosis aside — Mrs Bradstock felt so angry about it she threatened to get her brother, a QC, to sue — Coneygree was worth something after all.

He was the horse that could, overcoming newness, shyness and an ability to pick up the strangest injuries to beat a field that included Tony McCoy on his last Gold Cup ride, Carlingford Lough. To be fair, not even the love of the common people was present for McCoy’s horse, which went off at 14-1 and never contested, and some will say that Coneygree’s victory was evidence of a poor field.

Mark Bradstock insisted there was no such thing — just the odd Gold Cup that was more open than in other years, and either way, the manner in which Coneygree came home made him one of the bravest, if not the best, Cheltenham has seen.

There is something so marvellous about a front-runner. It is the honesty, for a start. Everything is out there. It is why the public warmed to Paula Radcliffe. By the time Coneygree came up the hill, any onlooker not financially involved will have been yearning for him to hold on. Doubly so if they knew his history

‘This little mare that only cost £3,000,’ said Mrs Bradstock of Coneygree’s mum, Plaid Maid. She had been bought to give her father, who suffered from Alzheimer’s late in life, a little interest in his retirement. He bred Coneygree from her, and another horse of note, Carruthers, which won the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in 2011.

‘All of the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses,’ Mrs Bradstock added. ‘People quoted statistics at us, but this shows anyone can do it. I always said, when we win the Gold Cup we’ll win the lottery — it feels that amazing. Dad isn’t here, but he is looking down on us today, I know.

‘Before the race I spoke to Nico (de Boinville, the jockey). I was reminded of what David Elsworth said about Desert Orchid. Nobody thought he could step up from two miles to three for the Gold Cup but David said, “If you go 20 yards clear, go 30”. That’s what I told Nico. If he wants to go clear, let him go clear.’

And he went clear. Not by much, nothing like 20 lengths. The winning margin was one and a half lengths and Coneygree was made to fight by Djakadam and Road To Riches. De Boinville was told he did it the hard way. He said he did it the easy way. ‘He could go again,’ he said, admiringly. In the distance, Coneygree steamed happily.

They are proper horsey people, the Bradstocks, and not just because Sara’s father was a rider and later a brilliant journalist and broadcaster. It is a small stable, no more than 10 horses, and whatever Mark spends the proceeds on, it isn’t a stylist. His hair looked like he had been dragged through a hurdle backwards.

He said he wasn’t good at watching races and had spent Coneygree’s three miles, two furlongs and 110 yards pacing and smoking. Bradstock had the air of a man who could have given Alex Higgins a run for his money in a smoke-off. His wife said he had nearly been arrested by security when his horse won.

Coneygree had been led up by the Bradstocks’ daughter Lily, whose junior riding career was curtailed by a neurological problem in her left leg following a kick from a horse. She wouldn’t have been able to walk two years ago, said Sara. Their son Alfie, who has a showjumping background, is credited with a lot of work, too. Coneygree jumped beautifully, testament to the effort Alfie has put in, along with rider De Boinville.

Sara said they had sent the horse over hurdles four times this week to prepare him for the Gold Cup. One imagines Sara is the real driving force in the family. ‘I’m drinking champagne and Sara will be washing him down in his box,’ Mark said. ‘She does most of the work behind the scenes. She’s magical.’

For there to be 41 years between novice victories at the Gold Cup — the last one was Captain Christy —suggests this was a win steeped in horse sense. The Bradstocks knew Coneygree’s injuries made it more experienced than the average novice, and chose to run it here rather than in Wednesday’s RSA Chase. The wet weather, and the result it helped produce, vindicated the call.

Captain Christy was seven when he outran The Dikler in 1974. Coneygree is a year older. Mrs Bradstock talked about his perceived fragility — the ‘ridiculous’ long legs and a feisty temperament she believes can be expressed at the Wantage stable, but would make him shrink in a big yard.

‘He’s different,’ she explained. ‘He got an injury to a small muscle at the top of one of his legs. The vet said he had never seen a horse hurt that muscle before.’

She smiled. This was a different memory, without the sneer of that afternoon at Plumpton. That vet said Coneygree had been nodding his head. ‘Of course he was, he was excited to be on a course again,’ Mrs Bradstock explained.

Coneygree steamed on. He didn’t know he had won the Gold Cup. But whatever the hell had just happened, it definitely seemed like fun
