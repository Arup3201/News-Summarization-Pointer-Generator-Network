A motorist has died after an horrific car crash on the M25 which is causing rush hour chaos this afternoon.

Fatal: One motorist has died and several others are said to be injured after the horrific rush hour crash

Tailback: Essex police say the M25 will remain closed between J29 and J30 until after the rush hour

Three heavy goods vehicles and five cars were involved in the crash which has caused tailbacks of around nine miles back to J27.

Hundreds of motorists were left trapped in their vehicles as emergency services dealt with the carnage.

Essex Fire Service said they had to cut three people free who were trapped in their vehicles.

Two people were airlifted to Royal London Hospital via helicopter and are said to be in a serious condition.

Two adults and a child were taken to Basildon hospital but their injuries are not described as life threatening.

The M25 remains closed between J29 and J30 and Essex police are urging drivers to avoid the area completely if possible.
