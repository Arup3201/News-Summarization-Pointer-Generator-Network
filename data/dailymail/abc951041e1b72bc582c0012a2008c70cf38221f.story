Chicago is famous for its soaring skyline, but hidden from view is a 62-mile grid of abandoned freight tunnels once considered an engineering masterwork.

Although the impressive grid connects all major railroad freight houses and many commercial 
establishments in downtown Chicago, few people ever saw this system from construction in 1899 to its abandonment in 1959.

It wasn't until a contractor kicked a hole into the side of the one of the bores during the 1992 floods that the doomed passageways became big news. 

Out of business: Almost a century after construction, the doomed Chicago tunnels had helped facilitate the Chicago Flood of 1992, despite chief engineer George W. Jackson¿s original intention that measures to prevent flooding be maintained

Chicago: The Illinois Telephone and Telegraph built the first 26 miles of this concrete tunnel by 1905. But the Illinois Tunnel Company which took over, building another 60 miles, went bankrupt in 1909 and construction stopped

Multi-purpose: In 1912, the Chicago Tunnel Company started using the track to move merchandise, coal and ash before abandoning the unprofitable tunnels in 1959

In 1899, Illinois Telephone and Telegraph laid narrow-gauge railway in underground tunnels to help it excavate the tunnels, according to The Weather Channel.

Under the watchful eye of chief engineer George W. Jackson, the company built the first 26 miles of tunnel to hold telegraph and telephone cables.

In 1905, the Illinois Tunnel Company took over construction, expanding the network to 60 miles before it went bankrupt in 1909.

The network, widely considered cursed, was taken over by the Chicago Tunnel Company which sold the communication installations and 
cables but continued to use the track to move merchandise, coal and ash in 1912.
The group was finally forced to abandon the unprofitable tunnels in 
1959.

While the grid wasn't profitable, it was versatile.

The constant underground air temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit led 
to a curious second line of business — air conditioning. Several movie theaters bought
tunnel air to keep audiences cool.

After it was abandoned, many Chicagoans forgot about the concrete tunnels until April 1992 when one of them under the Chicago River near Kinzie Street was punctured, flooding most of the system and two dozen downtown buildings with open tunnel connections.

Today, some sections of the tunnels are used for utility and communication lines.
