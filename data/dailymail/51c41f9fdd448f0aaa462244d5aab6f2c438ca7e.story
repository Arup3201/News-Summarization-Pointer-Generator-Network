These incredible images offer a glimpse inside a northern factory which closed its doors overnight, leaving behind seven paper machines, newspapers and a ten-year-old pint of milk.

The Robert Fletcher and Sons Paper Mill in Greenfield, Oldham closed down overnight in 2001. Since then the abandoned mill has been left in a state of suspended animation. The factory is still filled with personal effects like cigars, work boots and safety goggles.

The floor of the abandoned mill is 
littered with relics of a bygone era, including letters and machine 
parts reminiscent of the golden age of British industry.

Bygone era: The paper machines at the derelict Robert Fletcher and Sons Paper Mill in Greenfield, Oldham, which closed down overnight in 2001

Since the colsure the abandoned Mill has been left in a state of suspended animation, the factory is still filled with the worker's possessions and the items of daily work life

Urban explorer Thomas Sherman, 30, photographed the interior of the derelict factory in June this year. Mr Sherman said: 'It was a mad experience, being in that huge empty and eery space.

'The factory was shut down overnight. They were all working one day and then they just closed it.

'The whole place feels as though it was frozen in time, as if everyone finished work one day, put their stuff down and never came back.'

The Lancashire mill, which specialised in cigarette papers, first opened in 1921 when the top salary for a factory worker was 6d an hour.

The factory housed seven paper machines which produced a small fraction of the paper which modern machines can produce today. Mr Sherman, from Manchester, said: 'Bits and pieces of daily life were still there.

'I saw loads of bits left about, such as a jar of buttons, and newspapers from the 1990s.

'It looked like they closed the doors one day and left the mill behind forever.'

The mill was owned by Robert Fletcher and Sons, prominent paper merchants who began trading in the early 19th century.

The firm also owned another paper mill in Stoneclough near the Greenfield site. Both mills started to struggle financially in the late 1990s due to the rising cost of wood pulp. In an effort to save the business, the Stoneclough site was shut down in 2000 with the loss of 120 jobs.

Despite this move the company continued to spiral into financial ruin. In July 2001 several suppliers and creditors formally applied to wind up the company forcing the overnight closure of the Greenfield site.
