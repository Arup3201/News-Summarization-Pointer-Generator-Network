The British girl who was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men in Majorca has been forgiven by her family of born-again Christians, a friend today claimed.

The 18-year-old blonde, from Northern Ireland, was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island's notorious party capital of Magaluf. 

Donning
 pink hotpants and a loose-fitting white vest top, she was cheered on by revellers as 
she moved from man to man, encouraging each of them to take their 
trousers down.

The two-minute footage was later posted 
online and quickly went viral, sparking outrage among local politicians 
and women's rights groups.

But now, a friend has revealed she has been 'fully forgiven' by her family, who are said to have been 'deeply involved' in a born-again Christian movement for a number of years.

'She 
made a terrible mistake a few weeks ago and she has been fully forgiven.
 Her family love her and will protect her in their faith,' the family friend told the Irish Daily Mirror.

'She has been a victim, a target of evil, of wickedness and she has most definitely been led astray in a vulnerable moment. She 
dropped her Godly protection for a moment – but that’s all it takes.'

Footballer Nathan Redmond was among Twitter users who condemned the act, calling it 'sickening'

to Twitter to vent their outrage after the minute-long clip was posted

But the friend added that while the girl's family have forgiven her, they remain 'heartbroken and devastated' by the incident, which took place during a Carnage Magalluf event last month.

The girl's father, who was said to be 
'praying for strength and guidance' at the family home, refused to comment on his 
daughter's actions yesterday.

It comes as the organiser of the event has claimed that he 'doesn't know what all the fuss is about' as it was just 'an average night' in Magaluf.

Alex Collinson, 28, whose Carnage bar crawls help fund his luxury Spanish villa and swimming pool, took to Facebook to defend the video, even describing those taking part as 'stubs'.

'Don't no what all the fuss is about, it's an average night on Carnage bar crawl... turning inbetweeners into studs in six hours (sic),' he wrote on the social-networking site.

Mr Collinson, a fan of kickboxing, was investigated by police in May after allegedly attacking four members of a stag do, according to The Sun. Two of the men reportedly had their jaws broken, while the other two suffered facial and head injuries.

On Thursday night,
 police launched an inquiry into the girl's actions, which were said to be the result of an 'out-of-control' party atmosphere in which everyone was 'wasted'.

Backlash: The images have provoked a debate on Twitter, with some coming to the defence of the girl

A
 man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, said 
the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party 
organisers she would win a 'holiday'.

But her prize, in fact, reportedly turned
 out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach 
schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice.

Geordie
 Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take 
part in the game, claimed the girl had been swept up in 
Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture.

'This girl's gone on holiday, got 
fuelled with alcohol, someone's suggested it, she's smashed and thought 
it's a good idea,' he told The Sun yesterday.

The
 shocking video, posted on local newspaper sites, shows the DJ 
apparently counting the number of men the girl notched up on the 
dancefloor, while playing the song Sexy and I Know It.

The
 men can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magalluf, which is not linked to Carnage UK, a
 separate party organiser.

Meanwhile, several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones.

The
 girl, who is reportedly still in her job as a mobile phone sales rep, is believed to 
have flown to Spain for seven-night holiday with a friend last month.

Locals immediately suggested she was British, as are the vast majority of tourists in a resort which has a reputation for excess.

Dozens
 of posts about the incident appeared on Carnage Magaluf's Twitter feed,
 with some claiming it happens ‘everywhere every day’.

Reports said other tourists were being offered free drinks in similar sex competitions.

But the footage has been described by many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were 
regulated for the first time this year following complaints.

On Thursday, Spanish mayor
 Manu Onieva voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were 
investigating the practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a 
play on the crude Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’.

Benefits Street's White Dee, who claims £10,000 a year in benefits was a guest of Carnage Magaluf in May

Benefits Street star White Dee was a 
guest of Carnage Magalluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing 
the company’s T-shirt.

The 
42-year-old mother of two, real name Deirdre Kelly, claims £10,000 a 
year in benefits but flew to the resort despite being ‘too depressed’ to
 work. She
 returned to the resort last month and had been due to go on another pub
 crawl organised by the firm.

Earlier this week, Spain’s Women’s Institute called the video ‘degenerate, discriminatory and unfair’ towards women.

Meanwhile, the
 More for Majorca opposition party demanded that the activity be 
penalised, saying it was ‘an absolutely irresponsible and unhealthy way 
of enjoying leisure time’.

Politician David Abril asked: ‘Where is the responsible tourism we all want?’

Residents
 of Magaluf have long complained about drunken Britons wreaking havoc on
 the island, injuring themselves during all night drinking sessions and 
blocking off roads through towns.

The destination, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. 

It is especially popular with British tourists, who will fill the hundreds of bars on a 24-hour basis until September.

Carnage Magaluf could not be contacted.
