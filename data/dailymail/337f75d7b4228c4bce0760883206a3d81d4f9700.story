Everton legend Kevin Sheedy has launched a scathing attack on David Moyes, condemning the Manchester United manager’s attitude and tactics.

Sheedy, who won two league titles during a 10-year playing career at Goodison Park, is Everton’s Under 18 coach and has worked at the club’s academy since 2006.

He took to Twitter after United’s 3-0 defeat by Liverpool on Sunday and pulled no punches as he claimed Moyes ‘never took any interest in our youth team or players’.

Sheedy played for Everton for a decade between 1982 and 1992, making 314 appearances and scoring 77 goals.

The left winger lifted the First Division title at Goodison in 1985 and 1987, the 1984 FA Cup and the 1985 European Cup-Winners' Cup.

Sheedy now manages the club's Under-18 side after joining as a youth coach in 2006.

During his 11 years at Goodison Park, Moyes gave debuts to teenage talents such as England internationals Wayne Rooney, Jack Rodwell and Ross Barkley but Sheedy countered: ‘In my seven years Moyes showed no interest in our youth team.’

The tweets were subsequently deleted but there is no doubt the comments will upset the Scot.

But Sheedy did not remove the tweets in which he said ‘Punt the ball up to Fellaini. Great viewing’ and ‘We now have a manager who wants to win games’, a reference to how some Evertonians viewed Moyes as a negative-thinking boss.

He also did not disagree with one Twitter user who suggested Moyes was ‘arrogant’.

Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, insists there should be no concerns over Barkley’s form ahead of the World Cup.

Barkley played only five minutes of Everton’s 2-1 win over Cardiff City on Saturday. But Martinez, who sat next to Roy Hodgson at Old Trafford on Sunday, has assured England’s head coach that the 20-year-old has made a full recovery from a broken toe.

‘Is he ready to give something back to the England squad?’ asked Martinez. ‘The answer is “yes”. You must just understand that there has to be a role the manager wants you to fill.’
