A New Jersey woman faces multiple charges after she allegedly sexually assaulted a 8-year-old girl.

The victim told authorities 25-year-old Whitney Ball, of Wharton, promised her candy before she was sexually assaulted, the Morris County Prosecutor's Office said in a release.

Ball allegedly 'engaged in multiple acts of digital penetration' and 'engaged in multiple acts of sexual contact with' the girl, the prosecutor's office said.

The alleged sexual assaults took place from June 1, 2013 to September 1, 2013, it said.

'The victim also alleged that the defendant punched and kicked her in the stomach on multiple occasions,' the prosecutor's office said, sometime between June 1, 2013 and April 30, 2014.

Ball faces multiple charges: one count of first degree aggravated sexual assault, two counts of second degree sexual assault, along with two counts of third degree endangering the welfare of children, the prosecutor's office said.

Ball also allegedly punched and kicked the 8-year-old victim in the stomach, the prosecutor's office said

Authorities arrested Ball Thursday and she is now at the Morris County Correctional Facility, it said.

Ball's bail was set at $150,000, the prosecutor's office said. There is no ten percent option, and if she makes bail 'there [will be be no contact with the victim and no unsupervised contact with children under the age of 16,' the prosecutor's office said.
