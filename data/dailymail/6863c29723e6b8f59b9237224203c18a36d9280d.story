After a summer in which the Olympics, the Paralympics and the Euro 2012 football tournament have caught the public's attention, they might seem a modest affair.

But for more than 100 men who gathered in eastern France this weekend, the European Beard and Moustache Championships were as eagerly anticipated as a major sporting event.

Competitors from across the continent converged on Wittersdorf, near Mulhouse, to take part in the contest.

And, on this evidence, the judges must have had a difficult job deciding whose facial hair was most impressive.

Some wore extraordinary costumes to match their extraordinary hair, with several candidates sporting hats to complete their unusual look.

At least one man came dressed as a sailor, and many others turned up in military uniform.

But if some of the entrants wore similar outfits, the facial hairstyles on display varied widely.

While a few entrants decided to wear their beards big and bushy, others came to the show with curious curly moustaches.

Several participants received a helping hand from supporters as they sought to create a winning look.

Elmar Weisser, a 48-year-old German competitor, enlisted the assistance of his wife as he prepared to take to the stage.
