An exiled former member of a notorious religious cult has won custody of his many children from two ex-wives still part of the polygamous sect.

Lorin Holm’s nearly three-year-long court battle came to an end with Thursday’s ruling in St George, Utah, after only two days of hearings that awarded him his more than a dozen children.

Holm was exiled in 2011 from the Warren Jeffs-led Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) after being accused of being unfaithful to his three wives. His first wife left the cult with him and they sued for custody.

The pair argued the youngsters were at risk for sexual abuse after Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting underage girls he called ‘brides.’

Lynda Peine, one of the two exes, claimed in court she still follows the pedophile and the ‘laws of God,’ according to the Deseret News. The woman was accused by a woman testifying in court of helping Jeffs to assault her when she was only 14-years-old.

‘You’ve also testified that you understand marrying 12-year-olds or 13-year-olds is against the law,’ Holm’s attorney asked her in court, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

‘If there is a conflict between the laws of God given by Warren Jeffs and the laws of the land, which is supreme in your mind? Which would you follow?’ The lawyer asked.

‘The laws of God,’ she replied, according to the paper.

Holm and his attorney offered the testimony up as proof his children are at risk of sexual abuse or even being forced into child labor if allowed to stay with the fundamentalists.

Peine denied knowing why FLDS members called Holm an ‘apostate’ during cross-examination by his attorney, according to the Tribune, but did admit not wanting the children around him because he is a bad influence since being banished.

Peine insisted she has told the children only to respect and obey their father.

The judge awarded him custody because he said it was more likely the father would allow his ex-wives to visit the children than they were to allow him to visit them, according to the Tribune.

There have been rumors that Jeffs runs the FLDS cult from prison, the Deseret News reported. An estimated 7,500 people still belong to the group and follow him as a prophet, according to the Deseret News.
