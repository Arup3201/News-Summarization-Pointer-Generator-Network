The £13m boss of Lloyds signed off sick from work because of exhaustion, it has emerged.

Antonio Horta-Osorio, who pocketed a £4.6million golden hello when he joined the bank, stood aside on medical advice six weeks ago after suffering insomnia, the firm revealed yesterday.

But in a major surprise for the city, the former Santander chief announced he was planning to return to the office on January 9.

The news came as Lloyds Banking Group named the Co-operative as its preferred choice to buy the 632 branches it is selling under European competition rules.

A Lloyds spokesman said Mr Horta-Osorio had been working so hard he found it hard to switch off and couldn't sleep.

'When he started, he threw himself into the job, working like a dog, he told The Daily Mirror.

But Sir Win Bischoff, the chairman of the 41 per cent taxpayer-owned company, said Mr Horta-Osorio was 'bushy-tailed' at the prospect of coming back to work.

It follows Lord Tebbit’s claims in the House of Lords that the threat of legal action should hang over company bosses as a way of 'asserting the rights' of shareholders.

The bank will now enter into exclusive discussions with the Co-op, which beat off competition in the auction from NBNK Investments, a takeover vehicle run by former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman.

The decision to start exclusive talks with the Co-op did not involve Mr Horta-Osorio, the company said.

Lloyds is being forced to divest the branches because of the £20 billion in state aid it received following the 2008 financial crisis.

The assets being sold account for a 4.6per cent share of the UK current account market and up to 19per cent of the group's mortgage book.

There are five million customers and an estimated 9,000 employees.
