Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford has not given up hope of agreeing a new deal with Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite the latter's hints to the contrary.

Wiggins, Britain's first Tour de France winner in 2012, has yet to sign a new contract with the pro team after being left out of this year's event.

Instead, he joined England's team pursuit squad at the Commonwealth Games, picking up silver alongside Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Andy Tennant at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome on Thursday.

Compromise: Team Sky's Brailsford wants to 'find an ideal scenario' so Wiggins can sign a new contract

Speaking afterwards, 34-year-old Wiggins confirmed that his priority now is to claim a fifth Olympic gold in the team pursuit at Rio 2016.

That was not new information given his recent place in the Team Sky pecking order, but his subsequent suggestion that he may not ride another Grand Tour and focus solely on the track signalled a shift in tone.

Wiggins also questioned the 'cut-throat' and 'political' nature of road cycling - comments which drew a frosty response of 'everyone is entitled to an opinion' from Brailsford.

He refused to expand on that, but did suggest a Team Sky contract could still help Wiggins fulfil his Olympic ambitions.

'(It could happen) in the same way we did it for Geraint (Thomas) and Pete Kennaugh. It's doable, that's for sure,' he told BBC Radio.

'Ideally (Wiggins will sign). Obviously that's what we are discussing at the moment, to find an ideal scenario for Rio.'

New goal: Wiggins, who won a fourth Olympic gold medal in the time trial at London 2012 (pictured) wants to concentrate on claiming a fifth gold medal in the team pursuit at Rio 2014

Still smiling: Wiggins waves to the crowd inside the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome after defeat to Australia

Respect: England's cyclists applaud their Australian rivals as they step up to receive their gold medals

Rapid: The Australian team power their way around the track on their way to a convincing win
