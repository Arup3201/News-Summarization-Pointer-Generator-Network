Role model: Goalkeeper Luke McCormick killed two boys aged ten and eight while drink driving but is set to sign for Swindon on his release

A goalkeeper who killed two young brothers in a drunken car crash has been offered a return to professional football.

Luke McCormick, 28, is expected to play for Swindon Town FC when he is released from prison next month.

Arron Peak, ten, and his eight-year-old brother Ben died when McCormick smashed his Range Rover into their father’s car at 97mph on the M6 in Staffordshire.

McCormick, who had played for Plymouth Argyle, was sentenced to seven years and four months in 2008 for causing death by dangerous driving and being twice the drink-drive limit.

Under the early release rules, he is due to be freed after serving less than four years.

McCormick has been training with Swindon since January while on day release and is set to join the club on a trial basis this summer.

The boys' angry father Phil, of Partington, Greater Manchester, who was also seriously injured in the crash, said: ‘We’ve lost two sons as a result of Luke McCormick drinking and driving - yet not even four years on he’s being released from jail and will be back playing the game he loves.

‘Our lads will never play football again. It is so wrong on so many levels.

‘When he’s released he’ll be going on a pre-season tour to Italy - very nice, not a thought for the victims.

‘We are disgusted to find out only now that while he’s been in prison he’s been training with the team.

Tragedy: Ben and Arron Peak were killed in a horrific car crash caused by footballer Luke McCormick

‘We are the injured party here - we’ve lost our sons and I have terrible injuries that I live every day with - yet he’s living it up like nothing has happened. Just how can this be right?

‘If McCormick had just killed one of our sons he may not even have been given a custodial sentence - it’s not real justice at all.

‘Now he’s coming out into a cushy job that he loves. It absolutely stinks.

‘You would have thought managers of high-profile football clubs would have steered clear of him. As far as I am aware he clearly has an alcohol problem.’

His sickened wife Amanda added: 'That is the justice system - the families and the victims are just being forgotten. There is no justice here at all.’

Controversy: Swindon Town manager Paulo Di Canio is giving a trial to Luke McCormick (right) who was been triaining with the club while still in prison

Swindon chairman Jeremy Wray said: 'Our sympathy is with the family of the victims - that will never change. There's been a complete tragedy and lives have been destroyed.

'This guy has done his time in prison. He wants to come back and give something back to society.

'The best way we can do that is to rehabilitate, and that's the role Swindon can play. It's a benefit we've thought about in the long term.

Speaking to BBC Wiltshire, Wray added: 'It's going to be a big debate and I'm not frightened of it.

'Luke might have done three and a half years but he undoubtedly wakes up with a life sentence every day and thinking about what he's done.

'Does he try and do something positive with the rest of his life and give something back? If one life is saved in the future because of that, then it's the right action.'
