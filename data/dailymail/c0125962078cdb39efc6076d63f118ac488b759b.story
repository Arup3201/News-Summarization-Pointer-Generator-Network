Team news

Chelsea

Diego Costa is suspended as Chelsea play Tottenham in the Barclays Premier League on Wednesday night.

Loic Remy and Didier Drogba are in contention to start up front in place of Costa, who serves a one-game ban after being shown his fifth yellow card of the season in last Saturday's goalless draw at Sunderland.

Defender or midfielder Nathan Ake (hamstring) missed the trip to Wearside and is unlikely to be included.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Schwarzer.

Emmanuel Adebayor, who has been suffering from a virus and back problem, is among several players who will be assessed, with Etienne Capoue and Danny Rose also concerns with knocks.

Full-back Kyle Walker continued his recovery from abdominal surgery by playing for the Under-21s against Manchester City on Monday night.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Davies, Vertonghen, Fazio, Chiriches, Bentaleb, Lennon, Mason, Kane, Eriksen, Soldado, Vorm, Lamela, Chadli, Kaboul, Dembele, Dier, Paulinho, Adebayor, Rose, Capoue.
