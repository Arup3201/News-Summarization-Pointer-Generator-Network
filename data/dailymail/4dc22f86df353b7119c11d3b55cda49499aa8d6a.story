Two love rivals who moved in together when the woman they loved died fell out so badly that one tried to kill the other, a court heard today.

Mark Motteram, 45, and Steve Cook, 37, put any romantic rivalry behind them so they could raise Anne Motteram’s children together.

Mrs Motteram had three children with ex-husband Mr Motteram and one with her new partner Mr Cook. But she suffered a fatal heart attack at her home in Southampton aged 40.

Mr Motteram and Mr Cook then vowed to raise the children together as an ‘unconventional family’. But Winchester Crown Court was told that the animosity between them became too great.

They eventually went their separate ways and became embroiled in a ‘bitter custody battle’ over Mr Cook and Mrs Motteram’s youngest daughter, four-year-old Catherine.

Mr Cook moved to Derby, where he won custody of his daughter on the condition she took four short holidays a year in Southampton.

He dropped her off for her first visit and went straight to Southampton Central Police Station where he told officers he had ‘concerns for the children’s welfare’.

Disgruntled Mr Cook - annoyed that Mr Motteram had access rights - claimed there was a stash of drugs in the house and no food, the court heard.

It led to police raiding the property, where they found healthy food, a full freezer, and no sign of drugs.

The false allegation angered Mr Motteram, who armed himself with a 4in kitchen knife when Mr Cook arrived to collect his daughter at the end of the week.

Tom Wright, prosecuting, said Mr Motteram lunged at Mr Cook as he opened the door, stabbing him once in the chest, on November 26 last year.

The court heard there was no animosity between the pair at the time Mr Cook started a relationship with Mrs Motteram, but things deteriorated after her death on February 26, 2011.

'The circumstances surrounding this case are tragic. Mr Motteram is remorseful and wishes it was himself he harmed'

Mr Wright said: ‘After Mrs Motteram’s sad demise, the children and two men did try making a go of things as a family. Unhappily, the two men did not get on well - friction and animosity led to that situation breaking up.

‘The break-up was acrimonious and was exacerbated by the custody battle that then went through the court.’

Mr
 Wright told the court Mr Cook contacted police to report his welfare 
concerns, and added: ‘Whatever Mr Cook’s motivation, the effect was to 
further sour Mr Motteram’s attitude towards him.

‘When he went to collect Catherine at the end of her stay, he rang the doorbell and Mr Motteram immediately lunged at him with a kitchen knife. The knife struck Mr Cook just below the ribs, above the abdomen.

‘Perhaps because Mr Cook was on his guard - and expected Mr Motteram to be angry - he was able to grapple with Mr Motteram and get the knife off him as they fell to the ground.’

Mr Cook was taken to hospital by ambulance where he was treated for the non-life-threatening wound.

Mr Wright said: ‘When police arrived, Mr Motteram was calm, co-operative and compliant. He readily accepted he had stabbed Mr Cook and confided to the officer that it had been his intention to kill Mr Cook.

‘In interview he explained his animosity had been building, and over the previous weeks he had nurtured a strong desire to do him harm and to kill Mr Cook.’

Keely Harvey, defending, accepted Mr Motteram had told officers he intended to kill Mr Cook - but insisted he never meant it.

She said: ‘This is an offence born more out of love for a child than hate for Mr Cook. The circumstances surrounding this case are tragic.

‘Mr Motteram is remorseful and wishes it was himself he harmed. Catherine spent a happy week with the family and was well cared for. She did not want to go back home.’

Mr Motteram shook his bowed head repeatedly as he sat in the dock, weeping loudly.

Sobs could also be heard from the public gallery, where Mrs Motteram’s older children from a previous relationship sat with those she had with Mr Motteram - Luke, 18, and Toni, 15.

Mr Motteram admitted wounding with intent and was jailed for four years. An alternative count of attempted murder, which Mr Motteram denied, was dropped.

The judge, His Honour Mr Justice Teare, said: ‘There are mitigating factors but that does not excuse what you did.’

Mr Cook and Mrs Motteram had two other children together but both tragically died - one was stillborn and the other was delivered after Mrs Motteram’s death but died a week later.

'After Mrs Motteram’s sad demise, the children and two men did try making a go of things as a family. Unhappily, the two men did not get on well - friction and animosity led to that situation breaking up'

Tom Wright, prosecuting

Speaking after the case, Flower of Justice church pastor Bob Light, who is now raising Mr and Mrs Motteram’s son Ben, ten, said: ‘The family are devastated.

‘This has been an incredibly tough time for them and is not going to get any easier. They have lost their mother and have now been deprived of their father.

‘It is a tragic case but they are doing their best to help each other through these tough times and will stick together.’

Speaking shortly after Mrs Motteram’s death, Mr Motteram said of his unusual relationship with Mr Cook: ‘People do think it is strange but we have always got on. Now it is more important than ever.

‘It is a weird situation but the most important thing here is the kids and what is best for them.’
