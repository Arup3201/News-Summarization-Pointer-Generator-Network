A gunman killed one person and wounded five others on Wednesday in a rampage that included a motel shooting, a carjacking and a home invasion and ended with his arrest at a nearby apartment in suburban Phoenix.

The suspect was taken into custody after officers spotted him on an apartment balcony and shocked him with a stun gun. Numerous officers led the handcuffed man to a truck parked outside an apartment complex.

Police later identified the man as Ryan Giroux, a 41-year-old ex-convict who has served three stints in state prison since 1994.

Giroux served prison terms totaling more than eight years for burglary, theft, attempted aggravated assault and a marijuana violation, the Arizona Department of Corrections said.

He was first incarcerated in 1994 and returned to prison in late 1995 before being released about a year later. He then returned to prison in mid-2007 before being released in late 2013.

Last year, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge allowed Giroux to remain on probation despite an unspecified probation violation.

Giroux is a member of Hammerskin Nation, a notoriously violent racist skinhead group, and an associate of the Aryan Brotherhood, a national prison gang, reports ABC7.

Although his latest mugshot shows that some of his tattoos have been removed, an earlier police photo shows him with the words 'SKIN' and 'HEAD' where his shaven eyebrows used to be.

His left temple also featured the number '88,' which is neo-Nazi code for Heil Hitler (because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet). His chin also featured a Celtic cross, which for white supremacists represents the white race.

Hammerskin Nation is the same hate group that Wade Page joined prior to his attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis.

Page killed six people during an assault on the temple near Milwaukee that occurred in August 2012. 

According to a May 2014 probation officer report, 'by the defendant's own admission, he has the propensity to become violent when he is either intoxicated or use illegal drugs.' 

The report also noted that Giroux's mental health 'appears to be stable until he uses methamphetamine.'

The probation officer wrote that Giroux 'wants to change his life around.' He had begun to have tattoos removed from his face and hands, reports AZCentral.

Police said Wednesday's shootings started with an argument inside a motel room that spilled outside, leaving one man dead and two women wounded, Mesa police Detective Esteban Flores said.

The gunman then shot a man working at a nearby restaurant. The adult student at the nearby East Valley Institute of Technology was able to run across the street to emergency responders already at the motel, Flores said. 

The school said in a statement that the victim was one of seven students and an instructor working at Bistro 13 restaurant. The student was treated at a hospital and released.

The gunman got away by carjacking the instructor's car.

Police say the man then went to an apartment complex about two miles away, where he entered an apartment and shot a man. That victim will survive, police said.

A police officer found another man in a neighboring apartment building with multiple gunshot wounds, Flores said. He was listed in critical condition.

Detective Flores told reporters just before 2pm PT that the suspect was taken into custody after a SWAT team spotted him standing on the balcony of a vacant condo in the 1700 block of West Emelita Avenue

The shootings prompted an intense hunt for the gunman as Mesa police searched the trunks of cars, interviewed witnesses and brought in SWAT and canine units from other agencies. Flores warned people in the neighborhood to remain indoors.

Several buildings in the area were placed on lockdown amid a heavy law enforcement presence. The Arizona Department of Public Safety sent its SWAT team to Mesa to assist with the effort, DPS spokesman Bart Graves said. Scottsdale police also sent SWAT and canine units.

East Valley Institute of Technology officials said the school went into lockdown as soon as gunshots were heard. The lockdown lasted more than an hour, according to students. Afternoon classes convened but were made optional.

A nearby Mesa Community College campus issued an emergency alert, saying it was on lockdown and anyone there should proceed to the safest location. The campus remained closed on Wednesday.
