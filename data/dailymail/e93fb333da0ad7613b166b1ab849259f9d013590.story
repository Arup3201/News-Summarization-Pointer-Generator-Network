'Conservation is not just a man's thing. Women should have an equal role to play,' says Maya Yogi, who works with the Nepali government to encourage more women to get involved with tiger protection.

I'm speaking to the landscape community mobiliser for WWF during a trip to Nepal where I witness the charity's staff grapple with the biggest wildlife crisis the country has ever faced.

Tiger numbers have dropped by 97 per cent in the last 100 years and the species faces total extinction within a generation if things do not improve.

Maya's mission to protect tigers in the Terai Arc region is in its 12th year.

Through her work with the Khata Community Forest coordination committee, where she leads anti-poaching, reforestation and education projects, Maya is not only helping to protect Nepal's tigers but also giving the country's women real work and a purpose.

But despite her years on the job, Maya has seen a tiger only twice.

'When I saw a tiger for the first time, it didn't strike my mind. I did not know how to react.

'It was only later, when I spoke with the two people I was with that they told me the creature was a tiger.

'It crossed my path. It was pretty big, and if I had known it was a tiger I might have been scared.

'Before I had seen a tiger there was 
this talk in the village, a common thought that only a few lucky people 
actually get to see one in real life.

'When I realised I has seen one, I felt like one of the chosen few. That in itself is motivation for me.'

Tigers really are very rare now. On my visit to Nepal, when they used to roam in abundance, I didn't see one in the flesh, despite all our efforts, although the film crew managed to find one drinking from a lake the day after we left.

The sheer scale of tiger slaughter is
reflected in the fact that just a century ago, 100,000 tigers roamed the wild lands of Nepal.

On a visit in 1911, the famously trigger-happy King George V was able to leave with a staggering 39 trophies after a hunting trip.

A century later, that equates to a third of the country's entire
tiger population.

Today, the
majority of tigers are killed using traps, that immobilise the animal -
allowing the poacher space to shove a sharp wooden spear through the 
tiger's mouth to kill it - keeping the hugely valuable fur intact in the
process.

WWF anti-poaching patrols look out for tiger traps. When they find them, they dismantle them and dispose of them.

Maya herself has been involved in the capture of six tiger poachers between 2004 and 2005, although she goes on patrol less today than she used to.

She
lives and works in the Gauri forest in the Khata Corridor which bridges
Nepal's Royal Bardia National Park with India's Katarniaghat Wildlife 
Sanctuary.

This is a 
crucial focus area for WWF but it is also an optimum spot for poacher activity 
as they make their way through Nepal from the country of supply to the 
one of demand.

WWF staff patrol the Tera Arc on elephant, foot, bicycle, car, boat and UAV piloting.  As well as supplying patrol volunteers, they monitor tiger activity with motion-activated camera traps set up on trees.

The photos are used to help confirm population 
numbers, as well as contribute to research on tiger behaviour
and ecology that forms the basis for planning for their conservation.

And
it is working. Poaching is decreasing and WWF are confident that with 
support from communities, government, organisations and the public they 
can double the number of tigers in the wild by 2022.

But the challenge the WWF and the Nepalese volunteers face is vast. While protecting the tigers, they're also faced with tackling an ingrained belief in tiger parts as medicine held by many Chinese and other Far Eastern people.

In the markets of Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, every 
part of the 40 stone body, from skin to bones, flesh and 
organs are sold for thousands of dollars..

'The Chinese still harbour bogus 
beliefs about medicinal properties of a tiger's body parts,' reveals 
Diwakar Chapagain, WWF's Nepal programme coordinator for wildlife trade 
monitoring.

A continued belief in the medicinal properties of animal parts is the driving force behind 95 per cent of illegal trade in wildlife, including tigers, elephants, rhinos and red pandas.

Tiger bones are used for medicine, 
tiger balm and soup, while an underground tiger vineyard which produces 
wine infused with ground tiger bone produces thousands of bottles every 
year for sale on the Chinese black market.

The National Trust For Nature Conservation, a partner organisation of WWF, works in the Terai Arc area to promote biodiversity and conservation.

There is currently one tiger to 63 Chittal deer - a potential meal for one of big endangered cats.

But it takes a tiger, on average, 22 attempts to catch and kill a deer, so more needs to be done to reforest the area and up the ratio.

The skin is still seen as a symbol of wealth while tiger flesh and organs are believed to cure ailments such as impotency.

A bowl of soup made from tiger penis 
fetches an eye-watering 3,000 Hong Kong dollars (approx. £250) by 
promising to cure erectile dysfunction - and Diwakar tells me the demand
for this potion in particular is increasing.

Despite the demand, the number of agencies, charities and governments ranged against the traffickers is increasing.

The governments, Chinese as well as 
Indian and Nepalese, all work together to curb illegal wildlife trade. 
The Chinese government, Diwakar tells me, is cooperating well.

But it's not just poachers killing 
tigers - it's local people who come into 
conflict with them. Human-tiger conflict is a very real and present 
danger for the species.

When tigers do not have enough prey, they seek out domestic livestock. Many
local communities depend on these animals for their livelihood and in retaliation, tigers are often killed or captured and sent to a zoo, in
an effort to prevent similar events happening in the future.

Already struggling to tackle poaching, the WWF has had to divert precious resources to increasing prey numbers in an effort to reduce human-tiger conflict.

Worse, many of the tigers killed by locals end up on the black market and in Chinese medicine - worsening the already devastating effect of poaching.

Local communities living around tiger habitats also depend on forests for wood. But
by entering forests, they increase the likelihood of becoming victim to a tiger attack - which have increased in recent years.

A recent study by Michigan State University on attitudes towards tigers around Chitwan National Park found natives are more
likely to feel positive about them if they live on the 'good' side of 
town, whereas those who live in rural and isolated areas have more 
negative attitudes.

'When 
you feel that you can control your surroundings and influence the world 
around you, then you tend to be more positive about what's in the 
forest,' said Neil Carter of the Center for Systems Integration and 
Sustainability who produced the report.

The WWF works on projects to help people stay away from the forest and avoid tiger conflict. These
include providing local communities with tolls such as stoves and 
systems with which they can use domestic animal waste as fuel instead of
wood.

There are also educational programmes in place to teach them about the value of tigers for tourism and the ecosystem.

Of the work done with local people, particularly important are the education programmes that teach that tigers are prolific predators who top
of the food chain along with man.

Tigers
attack and kill between eight and 10 people each year in Nepal, and 
natives are understandably hostile. In Chitwan in 2005, a single tiger killed a
group of five people enjoying a picnic.

This
is especially common if the tiger is a mother with cubs. If the mother feels threatened or the cubs are hungry, the human has a problem.

It is widely thought that when a tiger 
kills a person they get a taste for human blood - and so the people will hunt down the 
killer tiger to protect themselves.

Tiger numbers are at a critical low and they need all the protection they can get

It is control and understanding of environment that WWF is trying to give back to the people so they can avoid conflict, and also teaching them to love and protect tigers. Creating harmony within human-wildlife relationships is key to sustainably conserving species such as the tiger.

But it means that yet more resources that could be used to take on the poachers has to be diverted into other projects.

By purchasing special packs of Whiskas you can help save a tiger

As a result, cat food brand Whiskas has partnered with the WWF and hopes to give a financial boost to those trying to protect tigers.

They want consumers to understand 
the link between their own cats and endangered tigers in the wild so 
that collectively they can work together to help preserve this 
endangered species.

Little cat lovers can get involved by helping to raise funds for the protection of the world's big cats through the purchase of special packs of Whiskas.

'These funds will go towards supporting the tiger conservation programme within the Terai Arc region of Nepal where currently only 120 tigers survive within their natural habitat,' says Alison Clarke, a spokesperson for Whiskas.

Visit the website to see how every special pack of Whiskas bought between now and August will help to protect a tiger for a day.
