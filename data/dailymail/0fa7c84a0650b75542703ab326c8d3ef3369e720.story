Councils are using millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to hire private detectives for  snooping operations.

Dozens of town halls, several quangos and even one central government department used the investigators to check on both members of the public and their own staff.

Officials spent nearly £4million in two years on covert surveillance, background checks and other intrusive investigations by private eyes.

Tracked: 999 call centre worker Anthea Orchard, from Halifax was put under investigation by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave

The startling scale of the use of private eyes by state bodies came as it emerged investigators employed by a fire brigade fitted a GPS tracking device to the family car of a 999 call centre worker.

Anthea Orchard, 35, was put under investigation by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services who suspected her of moonlighting while on sick leave.

The private eyes they employed telephoned her with fake offers of work in an effort to lure her into a confession – but were rumbled when she traced their telephone number on the internet.

Mrs Orchard – who insists she has done nothing wrong and was not working illicitly – was also tipped off by neighbours who saw investigators acting suspiciously outside her Bradford home.

She has now left her job with an £11,000
payoff after agreeing not to sue the fire authority for ‘unnecessary 
surveillance’ and intrusion into her private life. Critics said the case
exposed the worrying extent of state snooping by unregulated private 
investigators (PIs).

Concerned: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who has conducted an inquiry into PIs, says their use is becoming widespread

In recent weeks the so-called ‘secret’ hacking scandal has revealed how ‘shady’ private eyes employed by blue chip companies, law firms and celebrities hacked, blagged and stole private information.

MPs are demanding the publication of a list of 102 firms and private individuals who engaged corrupt private eyes which is being kept secret by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.

There is no suggestion any of those PIs engaged by councils and other public bodies have acted unlawfully. But they show how the private investigation industry has extended its reach deep into the public sector.

Lord Justice Leveson was warned about the use of private investigators by councils, law firms and others during his inquiry into the Press, but did not investigate them or mention them in his final report.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who has conducted an inquiry into PIs, said: ‘I am concerned that the use of PIs seems to be becoming more and more widespread.

‘This is a worrying trend. The Government must put forward its announced regulation for private investigators as a matter of urgency.’

Nick Pickles, director of pressure 
group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Private investigators have been able to 
hide in the shadows for too long, even when they’re being paid with 
taxpayers’ money.

‘The fact that numerous public bodies 
think it is acceptable to use private investigators to snoop on their 
own staff should send a chill down the spine.

‘As the lengths that some private investigators will go in their work becomes abundantly clear, there’s a risk of a ‘‘see no evil, hear no evil’’ culture emerging around snooping.

‘Far more could be done to rein in who is allowed to launch surveillance operations and making them responsible for the investigators working on their behalf.’

Freedom of Information requests by Big Brother Watch revealed some £3.9million of taxpayers’ money was spent on private eyes over two years. That included 37 councils, several quangos and the Department for Transport.

Among the activities investigated by council-sponsored PIs were fly-tipping, blue badge fraud, fake insurance claims and housing fraud. They were also used to investigate parties in care proceedings.

In addition, several councils used PIs to probe fraud allegations against staff accused of stealing from their employer or faking sick leave.

The Department for Transport said it had used PIs to probe driving test fraud and fake personal injury claims.

The NHS litigation authority used PIs to examine insurance fraud, and the Legal Services Commission for debt collection. The Marine Management Organisation used PIs to conduct ‘fisheries surveillance’. The Food Standards Agency said they were used for an ‘internal discipline investigation’.

Laws due to come into force next year will see shady private investigators face jail if they fail to abide by new regulations. All investigators will be registered, forced to pass a national qualification, and undergo background checks before they are granted a licence.

Operating without a licence will be a criminal offence punishable with a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine.

Mr Pickles said the use of the tracking device to snoop on Mrs Orchard was a ‘staggeringly heavy-handed and intrusive response’. The mother of two, who lives with construction manager husband Gareth, 37, and children Ashleigh, five, and Haydn, two, returned to work last October after taking maternity leave.

While off she had started a part-time balloon decorating business. Shortly afterwards, she was off sick with stress and began to receive suspicious calls from would-be customers asking her to take on work.

She checked her Audi A6 car and found a GPS tracking device had been fitted underneath.

She said: ‘I have never felt as scared in my life, I couldn’t go out, couldn’t do my shopping. It stopped me doing anything.’

The emergency call handler was given a letter informing her she was under investigation. On October 31 she was signed off sick due to stress, depression and a recently diagnosed condition, hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms such as tiredness, weight gain and aches.

‘As soon as I booked sick, I refrained from work. My husband took over the reins of the simple stuff but I didn’t work with the balloons. I took the website down and didn’t think of doing any more.’

Within days she began receiving ‘funny phone calls’ trying to get her to take on work. But searching the internet for the number brought up the private investigator.

She then found the tracker device which was attached by magnets and fitted with a SIM card to allow her every movement to be monitored. ‘This is an infringement into my family life,’ she said.

‘The whole situation has made me very ill. It is not right that public money is being used in this way. It was horrible to think someone was watching us.’

Mrs Orchard, who is now working full-time on her balloon business, added: ‘I haven’t been a mum during all this. It has affected the whole family. I’ve lost what was basically a £30,000-a-year career.’

She said the private detective agency was Nottingham-based Riding Commercial Investigations, operating under the internet name ‘localpi’. The West Yorkshire fire service refused to comment.

Sinister: The tracking device was left on the 
back of Mrs Orchard's Audi while she was off sick. Their use by PIs 
falls under a very grey area of the law

Putting a GPS tracking device on someone’s car to monitor their movements sounds like something out of a Hollywood film or an episode of Spooks.

But covert surveillance techniques such as these are far from the exclusive preserve of spies and police detectives.

Councils and other public bodies can use them to follow both the public and their staff if they suspect them of wrongdoing.

And their use by unregulated private eyes also falls into a very grey area of the law.

If surveillance of the public is ordered by the state, it will be covered by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which gave councils the right to carry out snooping operations. This led to examples such as councils tracking parents to see if they were lying about which school catchment area they lived in.

Recent changes to the law mean town halls must get permission from a magistrate. But it appears many cases of state snooping, including that of 999 call operator Anthea Orchard, fall outside this law.

RIPA applies only to the actions of councils and other bodies when they are performing their core public functions – such as a fire authority combating bogus 999 calls. But the surveillance on Mrs Orchard related to her status as an employee. As a result, the law which applies in the case is the Data Protection Act.

It allows snooping for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime. It also requires that monitoring is not undertaken for minor reasons – and requires intelligence or evidence before it can be conducted.

In accepting a payout, Mrs Orchard has foregone any legal recourse. Had she not she could have sued for breach of privacy, and the fire authority would have had to justify the level of surveillance and the methods it used.
