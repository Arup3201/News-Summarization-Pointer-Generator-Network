West Brom manager Tony Pulis refused to get carried away after the Baggies trounced Barclays Premier League rivals West Ham 4-0 to become the first team to reach this season's FA Cup quarter-finals.

Goals from Brown Ideye (two), James Morrison and Saido Berahino ensured West Brom booked their place in the sixth round for the first time in seven years, but Pulis is at present unwilling to contemplate the possibility of taking the Baggies to Wembley.

'We mustn't get carried away,' Pulis, who tasted defeat in the 2011 FA Cup final as Stoke were beaten by Manchester City, told BT Sport 1.

'It was a good performance, we're very pleased, but there's still a long way to go in the league and obviously we need a little but of luck in the next draw.'

Pulis was more forthright about two-goal Ideye and dismissed speculation the club's £10million record signing was set for The Hawthorns exit door during the winter transfer window.

'Even if we had brought Carlton (Cole) in, we still would've needed another forward to have stayed so I'm not so sure he would've left,' Pulis added.

'But he's done absolutely fantastic and there was a weight on his shoulders and scoring goals takes that weight off your shoulders and he's blossomed and looks a good player.'

While Pulis refuses to look further than the next round, Ideye, who has scored four goals in three games, sees no reason why West Brom cannot win the trophy at Wembley in May.

'We were on top of the game today, we played very well from the goalkeeper to the attack so I think if we continue like this good things will happen,' he said.

West Ham's miserable afternoon was made all the worse by substitute Morgan Amalfitano's second-half dismissal and Hammers boss Sam Allardyce believes his side's recent fixture congestion has finally caught up with them. 

'I would say it (the defeat) was probably coming based on what we've had to cope with over the last few weeks and I think it told on us today, there's no doubt about that,' he said.

'I have to give West Brom a lot of credit - they were very good. I don't want to take any credit away from them, particularly the front two today, but I look at the players and there was not the energy we know they've got based on all they've done in the last few weeks.'

On Amalfitano's dismissal, Allardyce added: 'It's unprofessional, isn't it? The punishment is laid down in our code of conduct and by the Football League.

'That will be dealt with, as always, internally and we'll move on, but I don't think it's made any difference to the result.'
