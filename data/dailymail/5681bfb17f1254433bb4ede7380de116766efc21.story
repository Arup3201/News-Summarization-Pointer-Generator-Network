Mini has unveiled three vehicles for keen campers, including the world's small luxury camper van and a pop-up tent that you can sleep in...on the roof of your car.

The Mini Clubvan Camper has been designed for a single person going away for the weekend and is based on the company's van.

The compact camper van has a sleeping berth for one person and a small extendable kitchenette complete with stove and fridge.

Based on the firm's van, the pint-sized camper has a small extendable kitchenette, TV, heater and a glass roof

There is a TV, an auxiliary heater and a glass roof that can be opened 'for ventilation or star-gazing', but the individual does have to sleep next to the car's steering wheel.

Described as a 'versatile home on wheels,' the concept model has a handhold shower, which would come in handy in such snug surroundings, but stops short of including a toilet.

The Mini Clubman Camper is one of the company's three concept vehicles

The firm said: 'The trio each reflect different aspects 
of the rise in popularity of camping and festivals, creating a choice of
premium home-from-home options for the enthusiastic traveler.'

Mini also showed off a strange pop-up tent called the Mini Countryman ALL4 Camp.

The company said it is a rooftop tent 
designed for 'safari-style accommodation for the adventurous spirit,' 
and folds up into what looks like a large, flat suitcase.

The tent is hidden in the large suit-case like structure on the car's roof. It is rigid so that people can sleep a-top the car on a stable base

The tent is intended for drivers who have taken a spontaneous trip to a beach or festival in Mini's 4x4 model and decide to sleep on the roof of their car...in a concept tent, of course

The tent is intended for drivers who have taken a spontaneous trip to a beach or festival and decide to sleep on the roof of their Mini...in a concept tent, of course.

The upper half of the tent is simply folded out of its storage box, which provides and flat and presumably relatively uncomfortable surface for tired drivers to sleep on, once they have clambered up a ladder.

However there are currently no plans to offer them as production models.

Mini has also revealed a more luxurious solution for couples, called the Cowley Caravan.

The caravan weighs a hefty 300kg, has a gas stove, water tank with pump and kitchen sink while a solar module charges the on-board battery to power the fridge, 
TV, DVD player and audio equipment.

The tourer has been named after the mini factory at Oxford, which still makes the modern Mini models.

The plant built the classic Austin Mini and is celebrating 100 years of car manufacturing in 2013.

The compact caravan has a cooking section at its rear, including a gas stove, water tank with pump and kitchen sink

Designed for two people, the inside features creature comforts including a TV, DVD player and audio equipment, charged by a solar power module

There are no plans to offer any of the three concept vehicles, including the Mini Cowley caravan (pictured) as production models
