Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has revealed that he was close to joining rivals United - until Sir Alex Ferguson told him to go to war with Arsene Wenger.

Nasri joined Roberto Mancini's City side in August 2011 for a fee of £25million after three years with Arsenal.

But the Frenchman could have been playing in the red shirt of United after meeting with Ferguson at a secret location in Paris.

It was then that Ferguson asked him to 'go to war' with the Gunners in order to leave the Emirates.

But Nasri was not comfortable with the prospect and instead chose to sign for City.

Nasri told BeIn Sports: 'We met with Sir Alex in Paris, in a hidden place, out of sight, so as not to fuel the rumours.

'But there was one thing that was a problem; I was asked to go to war with Arsenal to be able to join. I could not see myself doing it, especially with Arsene Wenger.

'After Man City showed their interest. Mancini called me every day during the holidays. I then decided that they really wanted me.'

After a barren spell at Arsenal, Nasri has experienced plenty of success at City, winning the Premier League twice and the Capital One Cup in 2014.

Nasri said: 'Manchester City was the first club to show interest.

'I had some doubts about the evolution of the club. Then I thought they really wanted me. They were about to sign [Sergio] Aguero and there was already [David] Silva, [Mario] Balotelli, [Carlos] Tevez.'

'I had a discussion with my agents. They asked me if I wanted to make history or be a player like any other at United.

'I said "Go ahead". I won the title in my first season, so my choice was the right one.'
