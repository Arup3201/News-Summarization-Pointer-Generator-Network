Reports in Spain suggest that Cristiano Ronaldo ripped off his shirt in front of the cameras when celebrating his Champions League final goal because he was being filmed for his movie.

The Portuguese superstar scored a penalty in the closing minutes of extra-time to round off a 4-1 victory, and he celebrated by taking off his shirt and flexing his muscles.

His celebration seemed rather excessive given that the game was already won, and reports say that Ronaldo knew where to stand for cameras to pick him up and capture the celebration.

He helped Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup in Lisbon last weekend as they came from behind to beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra-time.

It was the second Champions League Ronaldo has won having done so with Manchester United in 2008.
