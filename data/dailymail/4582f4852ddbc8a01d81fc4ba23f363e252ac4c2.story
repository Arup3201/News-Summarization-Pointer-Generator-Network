Civil suit: Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez is suing Casey Anthony for defamation after the cleared mother used her name for the fictitious nanny

Casey Anthony could face more questions over her daughter's death, after lawyers for the woman suing the 25-year-old for defamation demanded that she testify in the civil case.

Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez has filed a lawsuit against the cleared mother, claiming her life was ruined after Anthony used her name when she told Orlando police little Caylee had been kidnapped by 'Zanny the nanny'.

Her legal team have asked the court to force Anthony to give a deposition next week, as they fear once she is released from jail she will vanish under a new identity.

Anthony's lawyers intend to block the move, claiming she is is 'emotionally and mentally exhausted' after the criminal trial.

The demand came as Orange County Jail revealed twisted wellwishers are continuing to send Anthony money, swelling her jail commissary account to $470 - but it's still only $200 more before she was cleared of murder at the end of her sensational trial.

Strangers from Iowa, Pennsylvania and
even Canada have been sending $10 and $20 money orders, which Anthony 
has been spending on sweets including KitKats, Skittles and Reese's peanut butter cups in the run up to her release on Sunday.

But two days after she walks free from jail, she could have to give a video deposition at the office of Fernandez-Gonzalez's lawyer.

The 42-year-old  is suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she lost her flat and her job and found it impossible to find work in the three years since Anthony falsely said a fictitious nanny with the same name has her had abducted Caylee.

'Wasting time': Casey Anthony asked people to search for her daughter but they say she lied when she said she did not know she was dead

Anthony stuck to her story for three 
years, until her lawyer dropped a bombshell at the  beginning of her 
trial and revealed that the nanny had never existed.

Instead,
she had made up the babysitter using Fernandez-Gonzalez's name. She had the idea after 
she saw her details on an information card when they both visited an apartment 
complex on the same day.

Her
lawyer says after Anthony's claims were made public, Fernandez-Gonzalez
received death threats in the middle of the night against her and her 
children.

She was fired from her job as a housekeeper, and her landlord said he didn't want her on his property.

Fernandez-Gonzalez's
lawyer, John Morgan, told ABC News he plans to interrogate Anthony 
about her daughter's death - a move Anthony's legal team are likely to 
strongly oppose, saying it isn't relevant to the civil case.

Mr Morgan said: 'The first question I'm going to ask her is, "Tell us the last time you 
saw Caylee". The second is, "Tell us when you found out she was dead".'

Dismissing
their possible objections, he said: 'Everything about the death of the 
child is not only relevant, it's very relevant. It's the essence of the 
case. America wants justice. They want to make [Casey Anthony] sit down 
and tell them what happened.'

He will hold a meeting with Anthony's lawyers tomorrow to discuss the deposition.

Today
they officially filed an objection, asking the hearing to be cancelled 
because Anthony had suffered 'trauma' during the murder trial.

They
also claim that as the dates and location of her deposition have been 
made public, her safety would be in jeopardy because of the 'numerous 
threats that have already been made against her'.

In
a verdict that shocked America, on July 6 the jury found her not guilty of 
murdering her two-year-old old daughter, Caylee. She was sentenced to 
four years in jail after being convicted on four counts of lying to 
police,

Behind bars: Casey Anthony will walk free from Orange County jail on Sunday 17 July

The judge gave her
the longest possible sentence he could, but he said Anthony could 
go free on July 17 because she has already served nearly three years and
will get credit for good behaviour.

But Fernandez-Gonzalez's lawyers 
want the court to compel her to appear at a deposition on July 19, because they are concerned when 
she is released from prison on Sunday she will 'leave the jurisdiction 
of this court, disguise herself, change her name, etc., making it 
impossible to ever depose her.'

Mr Morgan said: 'When
Zenaida first came to me, we never thought Casey would see the light of
day again. It was never about money in the beginning. Now, it's about 
accountability and responsibility.'

The civil trial is due to begin in February.

Anthony
could also face two other civil actions. Prosecutors asked have the 
judge to recoup investigative cost for them and authorities.

The
mandatory minimums for those are $100 per case for felonies and $50 per
case for misdemeanours. The state is seeking reimbursement for more 
than that and said in a motion that it has documentation of what it 
calls special costs.

Texas 
Equusearch, a firm that helped for Caylee, also said it was seeking 
compensation for the $112,000 it spent looking for the two-year-old, and
said it is contemplating a lawsuit.

As Anthony prepares for her release on Sunday, money continues to be sent to her from as far away as Canada.

Records reveal that sweet-toothed Anthony has been buying candy including Almond Joy bars as well as 
packets of Skittles, KitKats and Reese's peanut butter cups.

Other items purchased include nachos with cheese and a jalapeno dip, flour tortillas and peanut butter.
