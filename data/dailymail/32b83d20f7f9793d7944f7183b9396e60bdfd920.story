An Orlando Magic basketball player has apologized after throwing a keyboard across a Florida Travelodge in the early hours of Saturday.

Glen Davis, known as Big Baby, was trying to book into the mid-priced hotel at about 4am but, when he was told there were no vacancies, he appeared to lose his cool.

Security cameras caught the moment the 6ft 9in NBA player reached across the reception desk and ripped out a computer keyboard, before throwing it across the room.

The 27-year-old from Louisiana, who has been on the bench with a broken foot for half the season, had been in good spirits earlier in the day, according to Yahoo Sports.

In a prematch interview, as his team prepared to take on Boston Celtics, he had a positive attitude about Orlando Magic's performance.

But his good mood appeared to have evaporated by the time he arrived at the Orlando Travelodge, hours after the team's defeat.

After throwing the keyboard across the reception area, Davis, who is due to earn $6.4 million this season according to SI.com, walked out of the $59 a night hotel.

The police were called, and the security camera footage shows two officers arriving to interview staff, but no charges have been made so far.

According to TMZ the hotel contacted the team to ask for damages to be paid.

Davis issued an apology on Twitter today, saying: 'There is no excuse for what I did ... I was obviously wrong and I take full responsibility.'
