Morris collapsed onto the pavement, 'stating he had shot himself.'

An ambulance needed to be called to take Morris to the hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

Police say that a search of the car turned up methamphetamine in addition to the handgun.

Morris was arrested on multiple charges, including suspicion of drug possession, after his release from medical care.
