Their football is often the very definition of artistic but Barcelona have been playing like 'machines' this season, according to Monday's edition of Mundo Deportivo.

The Catalan sports daily hails deadly duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, who astonishingly have played a hand in 19 of Barcelona's 22 goals this season.

They were at it again on Saturday, scoring within 78 seconds of one another in a 2-0 victory at Rayo Vallecano.

Messi's goal carried him to within just two goals of the Spanish league goalscoring record, held by Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra, who scored 251 during the forties and fifties.

Neymar has now scored seven goals in seven league matches so far, only two less than he managed in 26 matches last season.

Sport, meanwhile, hail goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who is 'the safest in Europe' after setting a new La Liga record for not conceding during the first 630 minutes of the season.

He broke the previous benchmark of another Barcelona goalkeeper, Pedro Maria Artola, who went the first 560 minutes of the 1978-1979 season without conceding.

Happiness at Real Madrid, too, after they thrashed Athletic Bilbao 5-0 at the Bernabeu to move within four points of Barca.

The front cover of Marca described their performances as a 'cyclone' as Real move from 'thrashing to thrashing.'

They add that the 'BBC' of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema are 'building an irresistible Madrid.'

The Portuguese scored his 22nd league hat-trick, equalling the record shared between Zarra and Alfredo Di Stefano. It is his third treble in four league matches.

Benzema, who scored the other two, is hailed by Ronaldo as 'the best striker in the league.'

Ronaldo certainly thought so, saying afterwards: 'Maybe this is our complete match. We are getting better.'

Sunday night's big match between title contenders Juventus and Roma dominates the Italian front pages.

'Juve joy, Roma rage' says Gazzetta dello Sport after the champions' 3-2 win, secured thanks to Leonardo Bonucci's spectacular late volley.

Meanwhile, Roma doyen Francesco Totti caused controversy after claiming Juventus will always win 'by hook or by crook' after they were awarded two debatable penalties.

Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta blasted back, saying his allegations were 'unacceptable,' adding 'we haven't stolen anything.'

The row also dominated the front page of Corriere dello Sport, whose headline reads: 'Distorted title'.

Juve's two penalties were given despite the fouls possibly being outside the area, while their manager Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands.

'Juventus boss it' say Tuttosport, who add that 'everything happened but the champions end the happier.'

Arturo Vidal can expect a fine, they say, after reports of a confrontation in a nightclub late on Thursday night, which meant he was late to training the following morning.

Sunday night's 1-1 draw between Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco only favoured Ligue 1 leaders Marsille, report L'Equipe.

It allowed Marseille, who won 2-1 at Caen, to establish a seven point lead over defending champions PSG.
