In light of the brutal rape and murder of two British students holidaying in Thailand, an Australian woman claims that she nearly met the same fate.

Rather than staying on Koh Tao, the Melbourne woman was celebrating in Phuket after the wedding of a family member, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

She told local media a hotel security guard attempted to rape her on an isolated rocky beach near a five-star resort in the early hours of the morning.

The woman also revealed she suspected her drink had been spiked after she started to feel disoriented and unwell after a late-night swim.

The security guard allegedly tried to lead the woman down a path towards a dark beach and away from her hotel, insisting that he was taking her in the right direction.

'I was still insisting I want to go this way and before I knew what was happening he put his arm around me and directed me towards the beach, so quickly I didn't have a chance to react ... all of a sudden I was on the beach and he kept pulling me towards the dark coconut palms,' the woman  revealed to Phuket-based news organisation Phuketwan.

'Before I knew it, he was on me, he was holding me, pushing and pushing. His face was on me, he was kissing me and touching me. '

The woman fought back, and luckily managed to escape back to her room, with some injuries. 

The Melbourne woman was celebrating at a five-star resort after a family member's wedding, when she was dragged away by a security guard

'I was trying to kick him. I knew that I had to get out of there or I was going to get seriously raped. I screamed "No! Get away from me! I go home now!" I pushed him out of the way and ran back towards the party.'

But she stayed on the island for a short period after in order to try and bring her alleged attacker to justice. 

The woman said she wanted to share her story to prevent other people meeting the same fate, from someone she presumed she could trust like a security guard.

This comes soon after the brutal rape and murder of British backpacker Hannah Witherage, and the killing of David Miller on the resort island of Koh Tao.

Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested in October for murders of British tourists Witheridge and Miller, but have since retracted their confessions, amid claims of torture.
