A smartphone made out of bamboo has been designed by a British student.

Kieron-Scott Woodhouse, from Shepherds Bush in London, plans to release his product in the UK and throughout Europe later this year.

The 23-year-old, who studies product design at Middlesex University, was frustrated with the lack of variety in the mobile phone market so designed the bamboo handset in his own time.

Made from four-year-old organically-grown bamboo, which has been specially treated to ensure durability, the ADzero runs on the Android operating system and is about half the size of an iPhone.

Like many phones it will include a camera, but ADzero features 
technology called a ‘ring flash’ not available on any current mobile 
phone.

A circular photographic flash around the camera’s lens ensures 
very even illumination and minimises shadows. 

Mr Woodhouse said he had been overwhelmed with support for his product.

He said: 'Bamboo may seem like a strange 
material to use for a phone, but it’s actually extremely strong and very
durable, perfect qualities for this kind of application.

'The whole experience so far has been incredible and 
completely unexpected. I can’t wait to see my mobile phone in shops this
year.'

Mr Woodhouse designed the phone initially just for the Chinese market.

He picked bamboo, which must be four-years-old, as it is a sustainable material that can be sourced locally.

However, he was surprised to discover many people were fans of his design at London Design Week last year and he decided to publicise his work on the internet.

This led to him being contacted by technology entrepreneur Adzero and it will now be sold in the UK.

As well as being food for pandas, bamboo is used in Asia for furniture and grows quickly.

Dr Andy Bardill, Mr Woodhouse's tutor and Middlesex University’s product
design and engineering director of programmes, said: 'The web has 
opened up the highly competitive design sphere and enabled those with 
talent to get noticed more easily. 

'Kieron-Scott is a remarkable 
designer and has made the most of the opportunities Middlesex has 
provided, which put him in good stead to make his new company a real 
success.'
