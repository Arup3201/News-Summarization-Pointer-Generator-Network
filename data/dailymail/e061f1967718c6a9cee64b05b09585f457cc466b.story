Shenaz Ahmed was left with horrific head injuries in a go-karting accident which has left her paralysed from the neck down

A woman who was ‘scalped’ in a horrific go-karting accident has been named as 48-year-old mother Shenaz Ahmed.

Mrs Ahmed suffered ‘traumatic’ head injuries which have left her paralysed from the neck down after her hair became entangled in the engine of a kart at an indoor race track.

Her head was snapped back and she suffered horrific wounds to her scalp during the family night out with her husband and two children, aged eight and 11.

Last night, a source close to the family described the scene at The Garage leisure centre in  Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, as ‘like something out of a horror story’.

They added: ‘Her scalp was ripped off and became wrapped around the axle of the wheel. 

‘There were piercing screams and the men who worked at the leisure centre came running over. I had to hold her head because her neck had been snapped.’

The source said Mrs Ahmed’s young children had suffered nightmares since the accident last Wednesday. It is expected she will be in hospital for six months and may not work again.

The source said the family was speaking to lawyers and would seek compensation of at least £500,000.

They claimed Mrs Ahmed, of Cumnock, Ayrshire, was not told to tuck her hair in and that her helmet was not fastened correctly, so came off in the accident. ‘I’m just worried that this will happen to someone else,’ the source said.

Mrs Ahmed, who runs a property business covering the whole of Scotland, was taken to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock, after the incident at 8.20pm.

She was later transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist unit for head injuries.

Surgeons have already performed a successful procedure to reattach her scalp.

The accident happened at The Garage leisure centre in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire last week

The source said: ‘She has had one operation on her scalp, which went very well. She is paralysed from the neck down but is still talking.

‘At the moment, her neck is being held in place with pins. We are still hoping for the best.’

Go-karts intended for the general public are often limited to speeds of around 16mph. Most karts have a petrol engine mounted behind the driver which powers the vehicle’s rear wheels.

Speaking to the Scottish Daily Mail on Sunday, Carol Blanchard, secretary of the Association of Scottish Karting Clubs, said: ‘This type of accident is very unusual in Scotland. Our clubs all have to comply with the national health and safety standards set by the Motorsports Association.

‘Privately run tracks like these do not have the same nationally enforced rules. There are only four certified tracks in the whole of Scotland which are overseen by the national guidelines.’

Mrs Ahmed is being treated at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and may be in hospital for months

A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde last night confirmed that Mrs Ahmed was in a serious but stable condition.

An East Ayrshire Council spokesman said: ‘Senior officers from environmental health have conducted a thorough investigation of the site. They will now present a report to the procurator fiscal.’ 

Douglas Cunningham, the manager of The Garage, said: ‘As there is an ongoing health and safety investigation, I feel it would be inappropriate to comment further.’

In 2012, a woman in Indiana lost more than half of her scalp in a similar accident after her hair got caught in the axle of a go-kart at Whiteland Raceway Park in Indianapolis. Shelbi Crouch also suffered skull fractures and facial paralysis.

In 2009, 18-year-old Suzanne Cornwell was strangled when her scarf was caught in the engine of a go-kart at Peterborough Raceway Ltd in Cambridgeshire.

Peterborough Raceway Ltd and its then manager Paul Shinn both pleaded guilty to safety breaches.The company was fined £8,500 and Shinn £1,700.
