A judge has granted bail to a slaughterhouse worker accused of assault on condition he does not drink any more Red Bull

A man who appeared before a Belgian court on an assault charge has been granted bail - on condition he doesn't drink any more Red Bull.

The court in Bruges banned the 56-year-old slaughterhouse worker from consuming the energy drink after hearing how he went berserk with two knives, a starting pistol and a lead pipe after drinking cans of Red Bull.

First he hammered on the door of his former boss- who refused to open - and then he had an accident while driving his car.

The court was told he beat up the other driver and injured two policemen, who tried to arrest him.

They were treated in hospital.

The Red Bull fan spent two months in pre-trial custody before appearing in court to ask for bail.

His lawyer, Mathieu Langerock said his client had forgotten to take his tranquillisers before he began downing cans of Red Bull.

'That was the reason why he became so worked up,' said Mr Langerock.

'I think the decision to ban him from this particular drink is remarkable because the judge didn't say anything about not consuming alcohol.

'The ban will remain in force until the trial.'

A spokesman for Red Bull said: 'The drink can be bought in 164 countries and all health organisations agree that it can be consumed in complete safety.'

But Jan Tytgat, a toxicologist at Leuven University, claimed that an overdose of Red Bull combined with l alcohol could lead to aggressive behaviour.
