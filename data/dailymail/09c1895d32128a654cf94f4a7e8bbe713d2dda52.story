Hull have launched another raid on Tottenham as they look to land defender Michael Dawson.

Having already completed a move for midfielder Jake Livermore and signed Tom Huddlestone last summer, manager Steve Bruce has turned his attentions to luring Dawson to Humberside.

The FA Cup finalists are understood to have already made contact with White Hart Lane officials about a swoop.

Former spur: Huddlestone has become a first-team regular since his move from White Hart Lane

New Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has set his sights on signing two new centre-backs this summer - with Southampton's Dejan Lovren high on his wanted list.

The Argentine's desired changes to his defence has cast serious question marks over Dawson's role at the club next season.

Dawson has been a key player for the White Hart Lane club in recent seasons but Pochettino's high-pressing game may not be suited to the defender's qualities.
