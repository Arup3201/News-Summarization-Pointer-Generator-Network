Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left furious after his side were denied what he felt was a legitimate goal against Cardiff City on Tuesday night.

Striker Callum Wilson stood with his back to goal as opposition goalkeeper Simon Moore attempted to take a goal kick during his side's clash with Cardiff City, only for Moore's clearance to hit the forward.

The ball cannoned off the back of the number 13 before hitting the bar, and Wilson, who was signed by Howe from League One outfit Coventry City, then tapped the ball into the empty net.

Wilson and the fans celebrated, but referee Lee Mason was quick to disallow the goal and booked the 23-year-old Bournemouth top scorer, much to Howe's frustration.

'I've got to be very careful with what I say, we've been in a bit of trouble recently with officials,' Howe told BBC Radio Solent.

Howe continued: 'Callum (Wilson) did that all night. He didn't move, didn't follow the keeper, he held his ground and by the laws of the game that is perfectly acceptable. It's a goal that should have stood.'

Bournemouth striker Wilson just cannot believe his goal has been disallowed by referee Lee Mason

'You'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed, I don't think he had a particularly good game and that's an understatement.

'Callum was looking the other way, he stood his ground which is allowed and the goalkeeper has kicked it at his back.

'That's a real strange decision and ultimately it's cost us two points.'
