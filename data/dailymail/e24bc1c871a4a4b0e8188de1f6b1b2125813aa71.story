When David Knapp found out his son-in-law was set to pick up an eBay purchase from the homeÂ  where he was raised by his own parents, he was intrigued enough to go along for the ride.

But the grandfather's curiosity turned to astonishment when the bungalow's owner, after learning of his history in the house, handed him a bracelet his late mother Emily had lost decades earlier.

The 66-year-old grandfather-of-six admitted he was overwhelmed to be presented with the silver trinket stamped with his mother's initials - that he didn't even know she had lost.

What are the chances? David Knapp, 66, holds up the silver bracelet which belonged to his mother that he was reunited with after a chance encounter with the new owner of his childhood home

Mr Knapp's parents lived at the bungalow in Costock, Nottinghamshire, which was built by his grandfather, after they got married in 1936 until they sold it and moved to Nottingham in 1985.

'It's overwhelming to be honest,' Mr Knapp said.

'The owners held up a bracelet which they said they found while they were gardening outside the bedroom window.

'The bracelet had the initials ER on it. My mother's maiden name was Richards and her first name was Emily.

'I must admit I didn't even know mum had the bracelet, let alone lost it, until I was shown it.'

How it looked then: Mr Knapp's parents lived at 
the bungalow, which was built by his 
grandfather, after they got married in 1936, raised there children there and remained until they sold it and moved
to Nottingham in 1985

Mr Knapp grew up at the property with his two sisters and lived there until he got married when he was 28-years-old.

So he was already stunned when his son-in-law Andrew told him that he had to visit the property to pick up a sofa that he'd bid for an the auction site eBay.

And the retired computer worker had another shock when the owner of the bungalow gave him a silver bracelet which his mother had lost.

'I think it must be her engagement bracelet because there's a shape of a heart on it,' he added. 'Mum must have lost the bracelet when I was very young, probably while she was gardening.

'We'll keep it. It's of more sentimental value than monetary value.'

Heirloom: Mr Knapp says he'll keep the bracelet, which he thinks must have been given to his mother as an engagement present because it has a heart on it

The bracelet's finder Annie Sherman, who has since moved out of the bungalow, said she was delighted she was able to reunite the jewellery with its owner.

She said: 'I dug it up while I was making a flower bed and I kept it because I thought it was rather sweet.

'I had a lump in my throat when I gave him the bracelet. It's now back with its rightful owners.'
