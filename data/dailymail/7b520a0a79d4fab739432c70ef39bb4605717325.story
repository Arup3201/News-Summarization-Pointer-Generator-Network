Brit singer Rita Ora has jetted into LA for talks with movie bosses amid buzz over her role in Fifty Shades of Grey.

The blonde star, 23, plays Christian Grey's little sister Mia Grey in the movie based on E.L. James' hit trilogy.

Fifty Shades is released in February and the How We Do singer has also impressed 'Mr Oscar' himself, movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who hired her for his new film, Southpaw, starring Jake Gyllenhaal.

Mr Weinstein called Rita 'breathtaking', telling MailOnline she is his 'biggest discovery' as an actress this year.

How We Do: Brit singer Rita Ora, pictured arriving at LAX on Wednesday night, has jetted into LA for talks with movie bosses amid buzz over her role in Fifty Shades of Grey

He said: 'Rita Ora did a sensational job for me and Antoine Fuqua in Southpaw.

'Her scene is breathtaking, because she’s a very glamorous, beautiful woman; but, we did the opposite, we made her up to look like a tough junkie who’s got a kid to protect. 

'She is heart-breakingly real and wonderful and acting opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, who is riveting in this movie, she holds her own and then some. 

'I will work with Rita again and again and again. Personally, I thinks she’s my biggest discovery as an actress this year.'

Southpaw stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a boxer trying to make a comeback, while at the same time putting his personal life back in order. 

The film features other A-list names including Rachel McAdams and Forest Whitaker, and comes out next year. 

A source revealed that Rita is also in talks for another high-profile role starring a huge name.

Mr Oscar: Harvey Weinstein says Rita Ora is his greatest discovery this year

This week, Rita switched on the Christmas lights at London's Westfield Shopping Centre and treated fans to a performance. 

Meanwhile, TMZ have claimed the singer and her Black Widow collaborator Iggy Azalea were recently approached by Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas to perform two exclusive shows for $100, 000 each.

Although it's a large sum to the average punter, compared to Vegas' residents performers like Britney Spears and Celine Dion it's a mere drop in the ocean with the stars reportedly commanding around $475K per show. 

According to the report, Rita and Iggy politely declined the offer.

Inspired by her Halloween ensemble this weekend, Rita appeared to have changed her platinum hue for a pink one after dressing up as Barbie at the Death Of A Geisha party on Friday night.

With her new coloured hair, the singer is a great match for her green-haired boyfriend Ricky Hil, who joined her at the event at the weekend.
