A teenage jogger has died after he was hit by a train as he listened to music on his headphones – a week after finishing his A-levels at a top independent school nearby.

Harry Drain, 18, was running near tracks less than half a mile his school when he was struck by a freight train. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Yesterday British Transport Police officers were investigating how the student came to be struck by the train close to the Lincolnshire town’s railway station.

'Fitness fanatic': Harry Drain was killed on his morning run

Best friend Harry Treanor said the 
sports fanatic ran the same route each morning before going to the gym, 
and had asked Mr Treanor to accompany him on Tuesday morning.

The pair had been inseparable since 
meeting on their first day at the school, which was founded in the 16th 
century and counts General Sir Michael Jackson, a former Chief of the 
General Staff, among its alumni.

Mr Treanor said: ‘Harry went on the 
same route every day, which was a few miles long. On Monday evening, he 
asked me if I wanted to go running with him, but I said no.

‘We played rugby together at school, and we were both really into sport, but I just didn’t fancy going running.

‘His brother, George, phoned me to tell me what had happened. I am absolutely devastated, like everyone who knew him.

‘I haven’t slept all night – I sat up all night with a few of our friends just talking about him. It’s such a shock.’

The two friends were planning to go 
travelling together in a joint gap year before going to university. Mr 
Treanor said his friend ultimately wanted to go into business and become
an entrepreneur.

Weeks before his death, Harry had been
named ‘most popular pupil’ in an awards ceremony at the school. The 
teenager was a day-pupil and lived with his mother, Barbara, 56, and 
George, 19, in an imposing country home in the nearby village of 
Tinwell.

'Harry was faultless, he was always there for his mates. He never had a cross word with anyone, he was sociable, funny, and got along with everybody.'

Mrs Drain was too upset to comment yesterday. She has another son, James, 21.

Their 
father, Mark, is an executive for an international tobacco company and 
works abroad.

Mr Treanor added: ‘Harry was faultless, he was always 
there for his mates.

‘He never had a cross word with anyone, he was sociable, funny, and got along with everybody.’

School principal Stephen Roberts said:
‘The whole school community is immensely shocked by the tragic death of
Harry, who was a popular, intelligent and hard-working student and was 
greatly respected by his peers and teaching staff.

‘Harry had just taken his A-levels in 
business studies, geography and psychology and left the school at the 
beginning of July. He enjoyed many outdoor activities and was a keen 
rugby player, representing Stamford School in the 2nd XV.’

A British Transport Police spokesman 
said: ‘Officers were called to the line close to Stamford rail station, 
on Tuesday, following a report of a man being struck by a train.

‘BTP and Lincolnshire Police officers 
attended the incident, which is currently being treated as 
non-suspicious.’ The train involved was the 9.25am Mount Sorrell to 
Kennett freight service.

Stamford School was founded in 1532 by
William Radcliffe, a local merchant, with the encouragement of Lady 
Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII.

Other famous alumni include golfer 
Mark James, Europe’s 1999 Ryder Cup captain, and Colin Dexter, the 
creator of Inspector Morse.
