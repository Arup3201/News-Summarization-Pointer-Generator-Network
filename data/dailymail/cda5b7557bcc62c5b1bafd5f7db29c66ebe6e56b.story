A British man has drowned after being swept away by a strong current in a river in the Philippines as he tried to save his girlfriend's sons.

Mark Selby, 45, who moved from Stroud in Gloucestershire to the South-Asian country with his girlfriend Mary Anne Cruz and her children, got into trouble in the Balanac River on Monday.

The computer programmer was with the boys and the family dog when they were caught by a surge and dragged away.

Mark Selby, 45, drowned after getting swept away by a strong current in a river in the Philippines as he tried to save his girlfriend's sons (pictured with their mother, Mary Anne Cruz, centre, in the same river, the day before he died)

Ms Cruz's 10-year-old son, who has not been named, was holding on to Mr Selby's right shoulder when a lifeguard swam out to rescue them.

Mr Selby was able to push their dog Molly and encourage her to return to shore, but he was unable to swim back himself, despite being a strong swimmer.

He was pulled from the water and died in Pagsanjan, Laguna on Monday afternoon.

The family were reportedly staying at the Villa Socorro Agri-Eco Village and Farm Resort in Barangay Dingin for two days.

Mr Selby's sister, Debbie Poulter, 46, said: 'Basically they were all swimming in the river and they all got caught up in the current.

'The chap at the resort watches over the water and he realised they were in trouble, they were caught up in the current.

Mr Selby, with his son Steve (left), had returned to Britain before Christmas and flew back to South East Asia a week before he passed away

'Mark had one of the lads on his shoulder and he passed him to the guy who came to help.

'Then he pushed the dog towards shore, as if to help her out, but then he disappeared under the water. He died saving the others.

'He was very skilled, very clever when it came to computers - his job took him all over the world.'

Mr Selby grew up in Stroud before moving out to work in the Filipino capital Manila, where he met Ms Cruz.

He briefly returned to Britain before Christmas and flew back out to South East Asia on December 22, intending to make a permanent move to live with his girlfriend.

Ms Poulter said: 'He had gone back over to the Philippines on the 22nd of December.

Mr Selby was swimming with his girlfriend's two sons and their dog in the Balanac River in Pagsanjan, Laguna on Monday when they got into trouble. The boys were rescued but Mr Selby couldn't swim back

'He decided to go back to buy a house with Mary Anne and her children. She's lovely and he was so happy.

'I think they had gone on holiday together. They'd gone to this resort for a few days.'

Friends in Stroud, who knew him from his schooldays at the Paganhill Secondary school described Mark as a 'good looking chap, really fit and healthy.'

Writing on an online work profile, Mr Selby, said: 'Away from the computer you will likely find me climbing volcanoes, riding horses, swimming, boat riding, cycling, cooking, scuba diving, sampling beer or sleeping.' 

The Phillipines National Bureau of Investigation is conducting an investigation into his death. 

The Gloucestershire Coroner's office said they had not yet been informed of the death.
