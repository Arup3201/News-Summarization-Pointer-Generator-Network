A devastated mother and father have both been diagnosed with terminal cancer within weeks of each other.

Ian Lovewell, 53, and his wife Jayne, 50, both have incurable lung cancer.

Since the diagnoses they have vowed to live the rest of their lives to the full with their three children - Hanna, 28, Ross, 25, and Mitchell, 12.

Their daughter, Hanna Lovewell, said: ‘This terrible news has knocked our family for six but we’re all fully behind mum and dad.’

She said that her father, of Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, developed a cough in January and was initially treated for pneumonia.

However, after a string of tests and consultations he was finally told he actually had lung cancer which had also spread to his brain and liver.

Then last month, his wife began to feel unwell.

Mrs Lovewell initially put the symptoms down to the stress of her husband’s illness.

But, she was then diagnosed with lung and pancreatic cancer after making several trips to see doctors at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

Ms Lovewell says that neither of her parents smoke or drink and that both lead very healthy lives.

Mr Lovewell works for Britvic soft drinks in Norwich while his wife is functions manager at a local pub.

‘It’s been very tough,’ said Miss Lovewell.

‘It’s not very often you will hear someone say that both their parents are suffering from this at the same time.

‘We’re just waiting now to see what mum’s treatment will be.’

Miss Lovewell said her father had been given a year to live but they were hoping and praying he’d be with them all longer.

Cancer charity Macmillan is actively supporting the family and a relative is staying with them to help look after their youngest son.

‘Their attitude is that they will battle it and we all will,’ said Miss Lovewell.

‘We’re all trying to stay positive as we have to and stay strong to make the most of the time we have got together.’

She added: ‘We will do everything we can to enjoy everything.

‘It just gives you a totally different outlook on everything. Petty things just seem totally meaningless now.’

Miss Lovewell is raising money for the Mulbarton ward at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.She also wants to raise awareness of lung cancer.

She said: ‘It’s been amazing. People don’t know what to say in this situation, so having the fundraising is just a way for people to show their support and show it can happen to anyone at any time.

‘Up until now we had been lucky enough not to have it in my family - and you do just think it won’t happen to you or anyone you know.

‘Mum and dad are still young and very healthy.

‘It doesn’t matter how old you are or what your lifestyle is, this can affect anyone.’
