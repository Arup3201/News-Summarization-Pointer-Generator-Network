Illegal: Based in Sweden, The Pirate Bay is the world's largest BitTorrent site

An illegal file-sharing website has been taken off line after a cyber attack by a mystery hacker.

The Pirate Bay, which enables people to download files, music and films without paying, was suddenly bombarded with internet traffic which overwhelmed its servers.

The so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack left the site largely inaccessible for the last 24 hours, with only intermittent service in the UK.

The Pirate Bay took to its Facebook page to confirm the attack, saying that it did not know who was behind it, although it ‘had its suspicions’.

A number of powerful industries have already called for the site to be blocked, but it is unlikely online anarchic hacking group Anonymous were behind the onslaught.

‘There will be further attacks, but what's significant about this whole story is that people think that it is the Anonymous attacking a site which is typically a type of site that they defend,’ said Andre Stewart of Corero Network Security told the BBC.

‘It could be the record labels, or a government somewhere that has had enough of not being able to catch The Pirate Bay, it could be just one person who had rented some cloud power from Amazon and is sitting in a cafe, and is able to launch an attack.’

’If they're losing money and seeing that the government is not being able to stop it, there's a real monetary value reason for them to try and bring it down,’ Mr Stewart added.

In November the British Phonographic Industry, which represents music producer, called for The Pirate Bay to be blocked

The Pirate Bay, launched in 2003 by a group of friends from Sweden, allows users to search for and access copyrighted content including movies, games and TV shows.

In 2009, the Swedish courts found the site's four founders guilty of helping people circumvent copyright controls.

The ruling was upheld after an appeal in 2010 but the site continues to function.

A message on The Pirate Bay's blog said the move was an attempt by the music business to 'squeeze' it out of the market.

It advised users to 'circumvent the block' and campaign against the move.

The message said: 'Write to your ISP and tell them to appeal the case. Write to your local MPs and tell them that this is not allowed. Make sure your voice is heard.

'Remember, we’re all the pirate bay, and we must stand united against the censorship from our opponents.'

The Pirate Party UK, a spin-off from the political movement started in Sweden that backs copyright reform, said the latest move will 'not put any extra pennies into the pockets of artists'.

'Unfortunately, the move to order blocking on The Pirate Bay comes as no surprise,' party leader Loz Kaye said.

Enemies: The Pirate Bay has seen powerful industries align against it by calling on internet service providers to block the site

'The truth is that we are on a slippery slope towards internet censorship here in the United Kingdom.'

The director of Big Brother Watch, Nick Pickles, said web-blocking was 'a crude tool' and would not stop 'determined users'.

He said: 'The broader consequences risk damaging legitimate businesses and undermining cyber-security while further perpetuating the myth that this is an easy technological solution to a complex problem.

'Ultimately, the risk is that ISPs will be expected to monitor everything their customers do online to ensure they are not doing something they should not be. Indeed, it is almost inevitable certain groups will call for this when web blocking is exposed as the ineffective and easily-avoided instrument it is.

'As the calls for greater surveillance of our online activity intensify, the long-term risk is that the state will take on the function of deciding what we are allowed to see online.'

Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: 'Blocking The Pirate Bay is pointless and dangerous. It will fuel calls for further, wider and even more drastic calls for internet censorship of many kinds, from pornography to extremism.

'Internet censorship is growing in scope and becoming easier. Yet it never has the effect desired. It simply turns criminals into heroes.'
