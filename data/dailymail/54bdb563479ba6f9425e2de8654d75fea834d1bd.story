America's oldest indoor mall is now one of its newest settings for a trend in tiny-apartments.

Opened in 1828 Arcade in Providence, Rhode Island was nearly shut down in 2008 but the addition of 38 micro-loft apartments last year has saved the landmark from shuttering.

Now tenants are clamoring to pay $550 per month and up to live in the miniature homes, so much so there's already a waiting list.

Growing trend: America's oldest indoor mall has been transformed with the help of 38 micro-loft apartments

Tiny: The lofts measure no more than 300-square-feet and have a kitchen, bedroom, hidden storage but no oven

Saved: The Arcade in Providence, Rhode Island was nearly shut down in 2008 but the addition of 38 micro-loft apartments last year has saved the landmark from shuttering

Each of the units, which according to Curbed were inspired by ship construction, features a bedroom, living room, kitchen and hidden storage. 

However, there's no oven. But with a clientele that generally consists of recent college grads, that sort of omission is okay.

'They travel really light. They might have a bike and two suitcases,' J. Michael Abbott of Northeast Collaborative Architects told Curbed.

The once-struggling mall offered space on the first floor to retailers, some of whom even chose to take advantage of the convenient real estate upstairs.

The project is part of a rise of shoebox living in major cities across the country where, reports Bloomberg, restrictions on the low end of residence sizes have been lowered--some to as small as 220-square-feet.

The Providence Arcade opened to tenants in October 2013 at a cost of $7 million.

Investors are likely feeling good about the project. Not even a year in, there is already a waiting list for the tiny lofts.

Convenient: The shoebox apartments line the halls of what was once the country's original indoor mall. Retail space has been preserved on the bottom floor

The way it was: The Arcade was nearly shuttered permanently in 2008, but the micro-loft trend appears to have prevented that
