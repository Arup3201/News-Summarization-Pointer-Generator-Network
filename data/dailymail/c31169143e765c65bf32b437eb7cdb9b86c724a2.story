It's usually parents pushing children to do their homework.

But one pet rabbit from New Hampshire appears to be the one cracking the whip in his house.

Victor Poulin filmed Fuzzy the bunny keeping his daughter, Chyanne, in check. 

Each time the schoolgirl puts her pencil down, Fuzzy swiftly picks it up in his teeth and encourages her to pick it up again.

'Tell her to do her homework Fuzzy,' Poulin instructs the critter from behind the camera.

'Yeah, you tell her... it's not time for a break' he continues.

Chyanne can't help but giggle as Fuzzy keeps presenting her with a pencil. 

She then rolls the writing instrument back to him before he passes it back. 

Dozens of viewers have applauded the rabbit's tutoring antics with some deeming him 'cute'.
