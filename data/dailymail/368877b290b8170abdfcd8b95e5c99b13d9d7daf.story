Spared jail: Ruth Augustus sent letters with white powder to a host of top politicians

A self-styled nun who sent envelopes containing white powder to top politicians including deputy PM Nick Clegg was spared jail today.

‘Sister’ Ruth Augustus, 72, scrawled bizarre slogans about devil worship and freemasonry on the six letters before posting them.

When they were intercepted at a mail screening centre staff found them stuffed with a gritty white powder initially believed to be anthrax.

One envelope addressed to Mr Clegg had ‘devil worshipping’, ‘freemason’ and ‘your poor Catholic wife and children’ written on it.

Augustus also wrote ‘sex with 30 plus women’ on the letter - a reference to a boast in an interview with Mr Clegg about his bedroom prowess.

Another letter sent to former Labour Home Office minister Baroness Scotland was daubed with a swastika and two crosses and read ‘stop this evil devil worshipping’.

A third, sent to barrister and Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, also featured a swastika and the slogan: ‘Stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons’.

Augustus claimed the powder had been planted by the police but was convicted of plotting the hoaxes after a trial at Harrow Crown Court.

When she appeared at the Old Bailey to be sentenced she demanded to be addressed as ‘Sister Ruth’, bellowing from the dock: ‘I am a Catholic nun’.

The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, said the pensioner from Leyton, east London would normally have been sent to prison for her antics.

Bizarre: Both Baroness Scotland, left and Deputy Prime 
Minster Nick Clegg were sent envelopes containing white powder. 
Addressed to Mr Clegg, the envelope had 'devil worshipping' written on 
the outside

But instead he handed her a two-year 
community order requiring her to be treated for mental health problems, 
including a persistent delusional disorder.

She is already subject to a restraining order banning her from contacting MPs.

The judge told her: ‘The white powder was in fact harmless but the recipients would not have known that.

‘Had they opened the letters and found the powder there can be no doubt it would have been a terrifying experience for them, not knowing what the powder was contained in those envelopes.’

Augustus, who attended court in a dress bearing a picture of former slave and Catholic Saint Josephine Bakhita and pulling a shopping trolley adorned with plastic flowers and a Union Jack, repeatedly interrupted proceedings.

Targets: Sister Ruth Augustus also sent envelopes to Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP

After she was sentenced she told the judge: ‘My father fought Hitler but he shouldn’t have bothered.
‘It’s run by devil-worshipping freemason Nazis already, who break the law at huge expense.’

She added that she would be taking her case to the European Court in Strasbourg.

The first batch of letters was 
discovered at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17 last 
year when a worker raised concerns.

The envelopes contained a gritty 
substance which was first believed to be anthrax but tested negative and
was found to be non-hazardous.

More envelopes were unearthed on October 1 at the same centre, addressed to Mr Clegg, Baroness Kennedy and Tory MP Edward Leigh.

Augustus was arrested at a hotel where she was staying on December 7 and her room searched.It was then that two other guests came forward to say they too had received offensive letters from her.

One was accused of being a ‘drunken prostitute’ and another made derogatory remarks about the recipient’s Somali heritage.

When Augustus was interviewed by police about the letter to Mr Clegg, she said he had ‘lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government’.

She added: ‘He boasted about all the women he’s had sex with. He’s an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.’

During today’s hearing, Augustus asked court staff whether they could hear ticking coming from her trolley and asked members of the press in court to put her on page three of The Sun.

She continues to maintain the powder was planted in the envelopes by police but was convicted of six counts of hoaxes involving a noxious substance and two counts of harassment.
