Many scientific discoveries  - especially those made in relation to our vast universe - are immediately heralded as amazing.

But two astronomers have admitted they find the universe 'disappointing' after discovering it is smoother and flatter than first thought and have even compared it to an underwhelming holiday.

Nonetheless, their research challenges the widely accepted cosmological model of the universe and could lead to a rethink of what it is made of and how it evolved into the stars and galaxies we see today.

Astronomers Professor Chris Collins and Dr Ian McCarthy from Liverpool John Moores University were comparing recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation and galaxy clusters in two independent studies when they found the universe is flatter and smoother than previously thought.

Professor Collins said: ‘Have you ever booked a holiday to Switzerland expecting to trek the Alpine mountain ranges only to be disappointed  by ending up walking the flat countryside of Holland?

‘Similar disappointment was felt when Dr McCarthy and I conducted an experiment to measure the number of large massive clumps in the Universe, called clusters of galaxies.’

He explained that in some ways the findings were ‘a discouragement’ but they persevered anyway.

‘Science is at its most interesting when prediction and experiment disagree and so although our cosmic landscape is smoother than we thought, this may mean we need to re-think bits of our cosmological theory and such progress is good for science in the long run.

‘Although the perceived wisdom was that we would find lots of big clusters, in fact, when we looked, the Universe did not live up to our expectation and we found far fewer of these really huge structures than expected.’

Cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe was formed.

In 1965 scientists discovered the electro-magnetic waves that bombard the Earth continuously from all directions at harmless microwave frequencies.

The radiation that arrives at our planet has been cooled to only 2.7°C above absolute zero as it traverses deep space as the universe expands, meaning that in the distant past the temperature would have been much hotter.

This led scientists to conclude that the universe had a hot origin – the so-called Big Bang – nearly 14 billion years ago.

To measure the temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation, the Planck Surveyor satellite was launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (Esa).

It found that the tiny fluctuations in temperature slowly grow over time, eventually forming the stars and galaxies we see today.

Because the radiation began its journey when the universe was only 380,000 years old, these measurements provide vital information about its composition.

The cosmic census provided by Planck is remarkably precise, giving scientists accurate estimates of the age of the universe – which is thought to be 13.82 billion years old - and the amount of dark matter and dark energy.

The universe is thought to be almost 32 per cent dark matter and 68 per cent dark energy.

Interestingly, it has been found that Planck is also sensitive to the largest gravitationally bound structures called clusters, which contain thousands of individual galaxies and large amounts of dark matter.

And it has found fewer clusters than predicted based on the cosmic background radiation cosmological analysis.

Professor Collins and Dr McCarthy’s studies confirm the ‘Planck-cluster problem’ which says that there are many fewer massive clusters in the universe than expected.

‘We already knew that the number of clusters found by the satellite was lower than expected and we have now tested this by analysing a new carefully constructed independent survey of some 1,000 clusters over a large area of the sky using X-rays rather than microwave radiation,’ Professor Collins explained.

‘Our findings confirm that the number of clusters is about a factor of two below the prediction based on the Planck cosmic background radiation analysis.’

In a separate study, Dr McCarthy and his PhD student Amandine Le Brun examined the detailed statistical properties of the cosmic background radiation and arrived at the same conclusion.

Dr McCarthy said: ‘We’ve taken a completely different approach to previous studies, by comparing the predictions of state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations with the results of sophisticated statistical analyses of the cosmic background radiation.  

‘The comparison itself is quite straightforward and avoids any potential issues having to do with identifying clusters and measuring their masses.’

The discrepancy in the predicted and observed number of massive clusters strongly suggests that either the detailed survey by Planck is not correct, or else that the model itself is flawed in some way. 

If the model is flawed, one exciting possibility is that the deficit of galaxy clusters is pointing to an important contribution to the energy budget – or composition - of the Universe by massive neutrinos, which are ghostly particles that weakly interact with normal matter.

Particle physicists have long argued that neutrinos may have non-zero mass, but laboratory experiments have only managed to place relatively weak bounds on what the size of the mass is.

Dr McCarthy plans on carrying out large-scale simulations that include the effects of massive neutrinos on cluster formation.
