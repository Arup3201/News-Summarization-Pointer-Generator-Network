A pair of 'despicable' muggers who stole from a Malaysian student with a broken jaw during last summer's riots have both been found guilty of robbery.

Images of Ashraf Rossli being attacked by thugs pretending to be Good Samaritans became symbolic of the lawlessness of the widespread rioting last August.

Today the pair who stole Mr Rossli's belongings as he stood bleeding and helpless in Barking, east London, were convicted of robbery, violent disorder and theft.

Video evidence: Ashraf Rossli is helped to his feet, but then has his 
possessions stolen by Kafunda (in grey hoodie) and Donovan (in cap). The pair were today both convicted of robbery and violent disorder at Wood Green Crown Court, despite denying the offences throughout their trial

Guilty: Reece Donovan, 24 (left) and John 
Kafunda, 22 were both convicted of robbery and violent disorder

In footage which shocked the nation, John Kafunda robbed Mr Rossli minutes after he had been attacked by another rioter Beau Isagba, who had earlier stolen his bike after punching him in the face shattering his jaw.

The 22-year-old youth worker was caught on film pretending to help the 21-year-old accountancy student as blood poured from his mouth.

Kafunda's friend Reece Donovan, 24 was convicted of robbery and theft after being caught rifling through the student's bag while the victim’s back was to him.

Donovan, who was also found guilty of violent disorder and later burgling a Tesco store, stole a portable Sony Playstation and games worth £500 from Mr Rossli.

The footage of the attack on Mr Rossli was viewed by millions after it was uploaded to Youtube the day after his ordeal, and the public donated thousands to him following outcry over the clip.

The student from Kuala Lumpur, who had only been in the country a month, underwent surgery on his broken jaw and had to have metal pins and plates inserted in his face which will remain for life.

Mr Rossli had previously a jury at Wood Green Crown Court he knew what was happened to him but was powerless to stop it.

He said: 'As I sat on the pavement with blood pouring from my mouth I remember being approached by a male who asked if I was okay.

'I remember being pulled to my feet 
then I felt someone again tugging at my rucksack. I was not in a 
position to defend myself as I was still suffering from the effects of 
being hit.

'I knew they were stealing from me but I could do nothing. Once they had taken what they wanted they left.'

Donovan, of Romford, Essex, and Kafunda, of Ilford, Essex, were arrested after two independent witnesses, who have been granted anonymity, came forward to identify them.

The pair, both from Essex, denied it was them in the clip and despite already giving false alibis Donovan said he was out buying cannabis at the time while Kafunda claims he was at a neighbour’s house.

However, cell site mobile phone evidence put both of them in the area around the time Mr Rossli was mugged on the Queen’s Road flyover.

It took a jury at Wood Green Crown Court four hours to find the pair guilty of violent disorder, while Kafunda was found guilty of robbery and Donovan was convicted of theft and burgling a Tesco’s.

Christopher Hehir, prosecuting, said Mr Rossli, was set upon by gangs of hoodies 'intent on crime' as he cycled with his friend Sheikh Azhar.

As he entered a second group of yobs he turned to see who was putting his hand in his pocket to steal his mobile and was punched in the face by Isagba who stole his bike after he fell to the ground.

Mr Hehir said: 'What these defendants did was to take advantage of Mr Rossli in the aftermath of the attack, in a way that can only be described as despicable.

'Kafunda approached Mr Rossli and lifted him up to his feet. He gave every impression at that point that he was helping Mr Rossli, having realised that he was injured.

'If his initial impulse was to help it was quickly superceeded by a decision to steal from the helpless victim.'

Mr Rossli was set upon by another group, which included Beau Isagba, 17, pictured, who was convicted by a court earlier this month of punching him

As he got to his feet Donovan 'took the lead' in rummaging through his bag and was then joined by Kafunda who pushes the student back when he turns to see what is happening.

A dazed Mr Rossli, whose friend escaped the attack, is then seen stumbling up the road where he was spotted by members of the public and taken to hospital.

Beau Isagba, 17, has already been convicted of punching Mr Rossli, breaking his jaw, and stealing his bike and will be sentenced later this moth.

Following the guilty verdicts, the detective who led the investigation into the attack on Mr Rossli said the footage of the incident 'captured the heart of the public'.

Det Supt John Healy, from the Met Police, said: 'The victim was a visitor to this country for a very short period of time prior to the initial attack and robbery committed by Beau Isagba, who was convicted two weeks ago at this court.

'This incident being captured on video footage came to be iconic and captured the hearts of the public seeing a vulnerable person being taking advantage of.

'At the time of this incident he was suffering the effects of a broken jaw and was unable to defend himself.

'The defendants have denied the offences throughout forcing witnesses to give evidence anonymously to prove the case.

'It is a good result for the Met police and Operation Withern, the riot enquiry.'
