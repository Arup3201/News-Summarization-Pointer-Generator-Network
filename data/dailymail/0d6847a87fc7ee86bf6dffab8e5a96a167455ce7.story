Ronny Deila accused Ryan McGowan of endangering the career of Liam Henderson with a wild lunge in the dying moments of Celtic's Scottish Cup victory over Dundee United.

The Norwegian's side strolled into a semi-final meeting with Inverness by putting four goals past the Tannadice men, yet the third of four successive meetings between the sides was again pockmarked by ill-discipline.

Anthony Stokes was sent off by referee Calum Murray for a swipe at Paul Paton before McGowan was also dismissed for scything down Celtic sub Henderson – prompting the sixth red card in three back-to-back meetings.

And a clearly angered Deila believes the young Celt was fortunate to escape serious injury.

'It was a red card,' he insisted. 'It was a stupid tackle on the sideline. We need to get these things out of football.

'It was a youngster trying a little trick in the corner. You could have stayed there and kept him out wide instead of going in with both feet. He could have injured him for life.

'It must have been frustration. It was a straight-forward win in the end but there were some angry and disappointed players out there.

'It got a bit tense at the end but that can happen.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila claimed McGowan could have injured Henderson for life with his late challenge 

'These have been important games for both teams and sometimes it can get a bit tense.

'Today, we were the better team, like we were on Sunday, and they had some frustration. We need to handle that and get ready for the next game.'

Deila, who wanted to look at the Stokes incident before commenting further, isn' t concerned the ill-feeling will spill over in the fourth encounter between the sides on Saturday.

'I spoke to Stokes,' he added. 'His mouth was bleeding after a challenge from Paton and he reacted. We have to see it again if it is a red card.

'I am not concerned for my players. We have to be at the same level and get the three points. I am delighted to be playing them again.'

Celtic eased through at the second attempt thanks to goals from Jason Denayer, Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons and Virgil van Dijk.

But given the tempestuous nature of the three previous games, Griffiths believes there's every chance matters might get out of hand when the teams reconvene on league business at Celtic Park.

'That's six red cards in three games now and if I was a betting man then I would be putting money on another sending off this Saturday,' he said.

'It is just one of those things and the Dundee United players are getting a bit frustrated and we move on to Saturday and hopefully we can pick up another three points.

'I don't think there is niggle between both sets of players. I just think Dundee United are sick of the sight of Celtic.

'We have got them again on Saturday and then we don't see them for a while.'

United assistant manager Simon Donnelly believes refereeing decisions have gone against his side in the three games.

The Tayside outfit felt Ryan Dow should have been given a penalty in the League Cup Final while Efe Ambrose should have had a second yellow early in the second half last night for a foul on Nadir Ciftci.

'The Celtic reaction on the back of their player being sent off maybe influences the referee (when McGowan is sent off) but I'll need to look at it again,' Donnelly said.

'Is it any worse or any different to Scott Brown's two weeks ago?'

Asked about Ambrose, Donnelly replied: 'It's another yellow card. We deliberately put Nadir out there to play on Ambrose because he was on a yellow card.

Deila celebrates at full-time as his side reached the Scottish Cup semi-finals with a 4-0 victory 

'I thought it was another yellow card when we were having a reasonable period in the game.

'They've gone against us in the last few games. We've spoken about the penalty at the weekend. That's football.'

Meanwhile, Celtic skipper Brown says he's moved on from being photographed seemingly drunk in an Edinburgh street four days before the League Cup Final.

'I don't think I'm the first player to make a mistake and probably won't be the last,' he stated.

'But I've spoken to the manager, it's been dealt with and now all I'm doing is moving on.

'I'm sure the club, the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for Celtic.

'It was a real honour as captain to lift the League Cup on Sunday and we now want to push on and try to bring our fans even more success this season.

'That's all we're thinking about.'
