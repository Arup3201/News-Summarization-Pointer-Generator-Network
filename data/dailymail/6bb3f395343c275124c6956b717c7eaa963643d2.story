Attacker: Yuri Zarutsky today said he acted alone in the acid attack, which is a contradiction of previous statements

The man accused of throwing a jar of sulphuric acid in Sergei Filin's face said he acted alone and top Bolshoi dancer Pavel
Dmitrichenko did not pay him to commit the assault.

In a reversal of previous statements, Yuri Zarutsky, who was alleged to be the hired 'hitman' who became involved in the attack on Mr Dmitrichenko's behalf, said he initiated the attack independently.

The surprising development comes five months after Mr  Dmitrichenko, 29 admitted to paying Mr Zarutsky Â£1,080 to attack Sergei Filin.

Known as 'Ivan the Terrible' for his talent for 
playing ballet villains, the star soloist confessed to police that he ordered the attack in January after his girlfriend was snubbed for a role.

Police released video footage of Mr Dmitrichenko saying he organised the attack, but 'not in the way that it turned out'.

He argued he expected Mr Zarutsky to beat Mr Filin up.

He claimed at an earlier court hearing 
that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 
January attack on Filin.

'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said.

'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid.'

Yuri Zarutsky confessed his guilt today, and called for the two other defendants to be exonerated.

Mr Zarutsky is accused of accepting 
money from dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko and carrying out the attack on 
Sergei Filin.

Mastermind: Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to ordering the attack on Mr Filin but argues that he only wanted him to be beaten up and did not ask for acid to be used

Motive: Pavel Dmitrichenko is said to have been upset about the treatment of his Bolshoi partner Anzhelina 
Vorontsova, 21

A third man, Andrei Lipatov, is accused of driving Mr 
Zarutsky to and from the scene of the crime outside Mr Filin's home.

The latest confession means the men could be tried individually rather than as 'a group acting in collusion'.

They
would face 12 years in prison if they are convicted of a group crime, 
but eight years if they are charged with an individual act.

If tried as 'a group acting in 
collusion,' the men face up to 12 years in prison, as opposed to eight 
if they are tried individually.

Injuries: Sergei Filin has lost 95per cent of his sight and is completely blind in his right eye despite having 18 surgeries to save his vision

Filin's lawyer Tatiana Stukalova told Interfax: 'They are trying to break down the "group" and the "collusion"'.

Sergei Filin, 42, was left with severe burns to his eyes and face from the attack. He has lost 95 per cent of his sight and is totally blind in his right eye.

He flew to Germany from Moscow for treatment in March and had 18 operations in an attempt to save his sight.

In April a judge in Moscow rejected Mr Dmitrichenko's plea to be released on bail pending the results of a police investigation, deeming him a flight risk.
