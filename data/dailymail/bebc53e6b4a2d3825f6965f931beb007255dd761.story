Tory MP Zac Goldsmith has fuelled doubts over David Cameron’s leadership, saying he lacks vision and praising ‘magical’ Boris Johnson as his potential successor.

The multi-millionaire MP openly questioned what Mr Cameron stood for and drew a sharp contrast with the clarity of Margaret Thatcher’s politics, saying: ‘Thatcherism – most people understand what that means. But if you ask what Cameronism means, you’d struggle to answer. 

‘It’s not clear where we’re heading and it’s not clear what the underlying vision is.’

Zac Goldsmith said that Cameron's politics lacks vision and clarity, as he compares it to Margaret Thatcher

Mr Goldsmith went out of his way to heap praise on Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London. 

He said: ‘I’m a big fan of Boris, I make no secret of that. It’s very plausible to imagine him being the leader of our party one day, and I think he’d be a very good one.’

He added: ‘I see him as a very serious figure as he’s unique in British politics .  .  . whatever that magic is, he’s got it.’

The Mail on Sunday revealed last year that Mr Goldsmith had secretly offered to give up his seat representing Richmond Park and North Kingston to allow Mr Johnson to return to Westminster.

His remarks, in the latest edition of Total Politics magazine, come amid fresh speculation that more Tory MPs are poised to demand a vote of no confidence in their leader.

Mr Goldsmith made clear that talk of leadership coups was undermining Mr Cameron and damaging the party.

The MP, who described the Prime Minister as ‘very capable’, warned: ‘It doesn’t help to have leadership attempts, speculation or conspiracy coups.’

But Mr Goldsmith called on Mr Cameron to show more ‘clarity’ in the run-up to the next Election.

His criticism is the latest in a series of rows between the two men, who were once close political allies and friends. Two months ago, Mr Goldsmith – former editor of the Ecologist magazine – infuriated the Mr Cameron by forcing a U-turn on new planning laws.

An outraged Prime Minister issued a stinging rebuke, saying: ‘Who does that man think he’s accountable to?’

And last year, Mr Goldsmith, who before the Election was Mr Cameron’s environmental adviser, accused the Prime Minister of ‘political deception’ for allegedly capitulating to big business over genetically modified crops. 

He has also said Tory plans to perform a U-turn on building a third runway at Heathrow would be an ‘unbearable betrayal’ for his constituents under the flight path. 

In the Total Politics interview with fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson he repeated his vow not to stand as a Tory candidate at the next Election if the runway went ahead.
