A police officer from Dearborn, Michigan, was caught on video issuing a ticket to a woman in retaliation for failing to let him know that she is HIV positive during a routine traffic stop.

A 29-minute dash-cam video posted on YouTube shows Officer David Lacey telling Shalandra Jones and her boyfriend, Mark Scott, that he is ticketing them because he is 'aggravated' that the woman did not disclose her HIV status before the traffic cop proceeded to search her vehicle during the August 3 incident.

In the footage, Lacey says, 'I don't want to catch something' and 'I got a family.' He then wrote up a ticket for a broken taillight.

Violations: Lacey, left, determined that the driver, Mark Scott, right, was driving without a license and had a warrant out in his name for an unpaid ticket

In response to the incident, the Dearborn Police Department will have its employees undergo training on HIV and AIDS, CBS Detroit reported.

Police Chief Ronald Haddad told The Detroit News that he takes the matter 'very seriously' and is investigating the traffic stop.

'We want our officers to be peak performers, and a complete review will occur,' he said.

The Detroit Legal Services, which is representing Jones, said in a statement that the firm 'is working to ensure that Jones is protected to the full extent of the law.'

Attorney Joshua L. Moore, president of the firm, called Lacey's actions 'shocking, outdated and illegal,' and said that he is going to pursue all legal avenues for his client.

Police Chief Haddad said he is reviewing the incident and 'corrective action will be taken' if the officer is found to have violated department policy.

Lacey asked passenger Shalandra Jones to leave the vehicle so he could search it after he smelled marijuana

Aggravated: The officer rifled though the woman's purse and became upset when told that the pills he found inside are her HIV medication

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of contracting HIV from casual contact with an infected individual or her possessions is minimal, while legal experts say that people are not required by law to disclose their HIV status during a casual traffic stop.

It all started when Officer Lacey stopped a 1999 GMC Jimmy with a burnt out taillight in Dearborn on August 3, according to The American Independent, which obtained the dash-can footage.

The officer asked for Scott's license, but was told that he did not have it on him. After being questioned by Lacey about a strong odor of pot in the vehicle, Jones admitted that that she was in possession of marijuana, and handed him a small bag containing the substance.

Lacey then handcuffed Scott and placed him in the back of his patrol car. As he did this, he explained that he had pulled the couple over because of the broken brake light.

'I couldn’t even see who was in the car,' he said. 'I just rolled up and saw the brake light out, and I thought, "Well, you know, what? I’m kind of bored." So — might as well – it’s worth a stop.'

During a search for warrants for Scott, Lacey discovered that the man was wanted for an outstanding $168 ticket for failure to provide proof of insurance.

Retaliation: Lacey told Jones and Scott that he is issuing them tickets because he is 'pissed' the woman failed to tell him she is HIV positive

The dash-cam video shows that the traffic cop became upset after he searched Jones' purse, which contained a pair of earnings, and found the woman's HIV medication.

Lacey later said he is 'pissed' that Jones did not notify him of her medical problem prior to his search and said, 'Honestly, if it wasn’t for that, I don’t think I would have wrote anybody for anything. But that kind of really aggravated me, you know what I mean? You got to tell me right away, "I’ve got this. I’ve got that" ‘cause at that time, I wasn’t wearing any gloves.'

According to the video, Lacey didn't find any sharp objects that could have potentially put him at risk of HIV infection.

'I deal with plenty of crackheads and heroin addicts. Usually they all tell me when they got a needle on them,' said Lacey. 'They'll tell you right away what they got so that way we don't get pissed.'

Lacey issued Jones, who claimed to be a medical marijuana patient — though her card had expired — a ticket for illegal marijuana possession.

Scott was cited for driving without a license in his possession.

In an interview with MyFox Detroit last month, Jones and her attorneys said the officer violated her right to privacy and stripped her off her self-esteem.

'It took me a long time to be able to come outside,' the emotional Jones said. 'It took a long for me to stand up for myself.'
