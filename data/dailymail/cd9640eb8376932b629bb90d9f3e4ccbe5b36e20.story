An engagement ring designed to look like the infamous Golden Snitch featured in JK Rowling's Harry Potter series has proven so popular that its creator has had to close down her online store in order to fill her existing orders.

Orders for jewelry designer Miranda Scott's Snitch ring have been flying in in recent weeks, with demand increasing so quickly that the Ontario-based store, which is hosted on online marketplace Etsy, was forced to close down. 

'Due to the popularity of the Buzzfeed article on my Snitch ring, I have had a huge surge in orders and messages, and I need time to answer all of them,' Ms Scott wrote on the Alchemy House page.

The perfect ring: Miranda Scott's Golden Snitch-themed engagement bling has proved so popular she has had to close down her online store in order to fill her existing orders

Go for gold: The ring is available in sterling silver, yellow or white gold, with each ring featuring a golden topaz, which represents the Snitch's body

'At this point it is looking like the turnover time on the rings will be increased to 4-5 weeks, and I am also not taking rush orders.'

Ms Scott added that she hopes to re-open her store in 'a few days', but stressed that orders for the popular engagement rings would take a lot longer than usual to fill.

'I can no longer guarantee delivery before Valentine's Day, and rush orders are not being taken for earlier than that date,' she added. 

Marketed as the ultimate 'geeky' engagement ring for fans of the literary series, the romantic bling features a golden topaz as the main stone, which is designed to represent the Snitch's round body, while the band - which is available in sterling silver, yellow or white gold - is supposed to represent its wings. 

'At this ring, have a look, it was inspired by a book,' the Alchemy House page describes. 'If you're a wizard or witch, you could use it to get hitched. In gold or silver it may be bought, but official merchandise, it is not.

'Allow 3-4 weeks for me to make it for you, and JK Rowling, if you're reading this - please don't sue.'

'Wicked fast': JK Rowling introduces readers to the Snitch in the first Harry Potter book

Keep your eye on the Snitch: The impossibly fast mechanical creation is one of the key elements of Quidditch, a competitive team sport played by the wizards in Harry Potter

The Golden Snitch was first introduced to readers in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first in the seven-strong series of books. 

Described by author JK Rowling in the book as 'wicked fast, and damn near impossible to see', the Snitch is then revealed to be one of the key elements of the game of Quidditch, a competitive team sport loved by wizards the world over. 

The once-fictional game, which has since been transformed into its own national sport in the US, only comes to an end when the Snitch has been caught by one team's Seeker, an achievement which then earns that team 150 points.

And it's not just Harry Potter fans that are being forced to wait for their themed accessories; Alchemy House also boasts a collection of rings inspired by popular video game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. 

The sapphire Zora ring, the ruby Goron ring and the emerald Kokiri rings are all currently unavailable while Ms Scott fills her existing orders for the Snitch ring.
