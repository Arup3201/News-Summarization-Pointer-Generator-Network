The Premier League season is now just 12 days away... and that means the clock is ticking for you to sort out your MailOnline Fantasy Football team.

With a £100million budget you may think the options are unlimited, but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way.

Here, Sportsmail give their recommendations on three players that offer a bit of value to supplement your squad's marquee signings: Cesar Azpilicueta, Kevin Nolan and Stevan Jovetic.

Celebration: Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on three players to help boost your Fantasy Football score

Cesar Azpilicueta (defender, Chelsea) - Value £6.3m

He's the cheapest option of Chelsea's regular back four from last season - isn't that enough? With Jose Mourinho's side keeping the best defensive record around and being famously tight at the back, the clean sheet points are why you'll want Azpilicueta in your side.

The Spaniard's ability to play at on the left and right is a huge plus and his impressive stamina usually means he barely misses a game.

Add to that the fact that Mourinho experimented with him on the wing last season and you've got a great defensive pick here.

The Blues are early title favourites so those win bonus points should add up in Azpilicueta's favour too.

At £6.3million he isn't the cheapest, but in terms of value for money you're unlikely to find many better.

Class: Cesar Azpilicueta will rack up the clean sheet and win bonus points with Chelsea this season 

You shall not pass: The Spaniard is almost impassable on the flank and should be picked by Jose Mourinho

Good record: Chelsea do well against the top sides so you shouldn't have any high scoring nasty surprises

Kevin Nolan (midfielder, West Ham) - Value £6.6m

He's not popular with everyone, but there's no arguing that West Ham skipper Nolan is effective when he's at his best.

Nolan will cost you just £6.6million, a snip compared to some of the overpriced midfield talent going around - and typically guarantees goals. He's a nightmare to play against.

He famously links up well with Andy Carroll but with the long-haired striker out he will have to make do with fellow big lump Enner Valencia. His ability in the air should give Nolan a fair few knockdowns and rebounds that he loves to capitalise on.

And he scored on the opening day of last season at Upton Park - who'd bet against a repeat when typical late-risers Spurs come to town?

Captain marvel: Kevin Nolan might not be liked by all West Ham fans but he is certainly effective

Bonus: The midfielder often plays almost as a second striker so should gain more points for your team 

Discipline: You might want to transfer Nolan out further into the season if the bookings rack up

Stevan Jovetic (striker, Manchester City) - Value £9.0m

A fairly average first season in English football has pushed Jovetic's price tag down - and you should take advantage when you can.

With Alvaro Negredo injured and Edin Dzeko a player whose form peaks and troughs, the Montenegro striker should finally get a good run in Manuel Pellegrini's side.

He has been in excellent form in pre season and a decent double against Liverpool showed he can hack it against the Premier League's best - though that shouldn't be a surprise. He scored against Chelsea in the FA Cup last season after his team-mates failed to do so in the league.

If you're picking your team based on last season's stats you could overlook Jovetic, but do so at your peril. It's his turn to light up the Premier League and that can only help your Fantasy team. 

Good option: With Alvaro Negredo out injured Stevan Jovetic should get his time to shine upfront for City

Eye for goal: The Montenegrin forward managed to break the deadlock against City - not many have done that

In form: Jovetic has been in great form for City during their pre season tour of the United States
