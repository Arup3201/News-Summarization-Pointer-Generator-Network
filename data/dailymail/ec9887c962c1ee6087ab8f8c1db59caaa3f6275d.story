Come and have a go! Great grandmother Dorothy Blades shows off the walking stick she used to see off an attempted mugger

Shuffling down the street with a walking stick, Dorothy Blades must have seemed like an easy target.

But when a crook tried to snatch the 79-year-old's handbag, the unflinching great-grandmother had other ideas.

Mrs Blades - who is disabled with Parkinson's disease - wasted no time in putting up a fight and promptly clobbered him round the ear with her walking stick.

Stunned by the pensioner's reaction, the cowardly man took flight empty-handed down the street, Burnley, Lancashire.

Still unphazed by the ordeal, the widow says her only regret was that she 'didn't hit him harder' with the aluminium walking stick.

Widow Mrs Blades, who uses the stick to steady herself when she walks, said it was her 'instinct' to 'clobber' the man.

'You have to stand up for yourself and I would do the same again, only harder. You should be entitled to walk down the street without being mugged,' she added.

'I surprised myself when I did it, but I don’t regret it. My only regret is not hitting him hard enough.'

Mrs Blades was walking alone in the town centre when she was approached by the scruffy looking man.

As he grabbed her handbag, she screamed out and he then tried to grab her jacket.

But the pensioner, who has 12 grandchildren and eight great grandchildren, fended him off with her stick.

The retired weaver, who lives in the Brunshaw area of Blackburn, said: 'He was coming towards me on the street but I didn’t really think anything of it. I was on my way to see my son who works in that area.

'As he got alongside me he moved towards me and grabbed my coat and then tried to pull my bag off my shoulders.

'The bag was across my other shoulder so there was a bit of a struggle, but I wasn’t going to let go. I was saying ''get off, get off, leave me alone. It isn’t yours''.

'He then started to try and unzip my bag but he did the wrong zip, it went on for about five or six minutes, he wouldn’t let it go, so in the end I just clobbered him.

'I was very, very shaken, I was frightened to death and it was just instinct.'

The man, who was white, slim with a gaunt face, ran off along Plumbe Street close to the town centre following Tuesday’s attack at around 12.30pm.

He  is described as white, 5’6'' to 5’8'' tall with fair hair. He was wearing a scruffy brown jacket, jeans, black shoes or trainers.

She then made her way to her son Stephen’s work place, Tool Options, before police were called.

Dorothy, who has another son Keith and two daughters Diane and Lesley, said she would do the same again.

She said: 'I’m one of 12 brothers and sisters and I’m the smallest so I had to be tough. I wasn’t going to let him take my purse.

Brave: Widow Mrs Blades has Parkinson's disease but used her stick to send the man fleeing on his heels. She said she would 'do the same again, only harder'

Crime: Plumbe Street in Burnley, Lancashire, where Mrs Blades was walking alone when the man approached her and tried to snatch her bag. Police appealed for witnesses to come forward

'In some ways I feel sorry for him, but I blame the parents for allowing him to get in this state. I hope he gets comeuppance now.'

Since the incident Dorothy has had goodwill visits from her neighbours and friends, including her 83-year-old partner Tom Wynstanley.

Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle said: 'It shows great bravery and spirit to stand up to someone like that so well done on her.

'Like her I am just sorry she didn’t clock him harder, but it’s good she managed to get a good description of the man and hopefully justice will be done.'

The man is described as white, 5ft 6ins to 5ft 8ins tall, slim, with a gaunt face and fair hair. He was wearing a scruffy brown jacket, jeans, black shoes or trainers.

Lancashire Police said they were appealing for witnesses to the attempted mugging.

Detective Sergeant Nick Hodgeson said: 'The lady was extremely shook up and distressed by the ordeal and we would appeal to the public for information to help identify her attacker.

'Another man stood further away on Plumbe Street was seen by the victim; however his identity is as yet unknown. Police would like to speak to this individual and urge him to come forward.'
