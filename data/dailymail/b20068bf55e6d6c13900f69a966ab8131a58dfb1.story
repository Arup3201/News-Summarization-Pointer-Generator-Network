Guzzlers prevailed Thursday as New York's highest court
refused to reinstate New York City's ban on the sale of big sodas, ruling that
the city's health department overstepped its bounds when approved the 16-ounce
cap on sugary beverages.

The court largely ignored the merits of the ban in the
20-page ruling, but determined the city's Board of Health engaged in
policy-making, and not simply health regulations, when it imposed the
restrictions on restaurants, delis, movie theaters, stadiums and street cart
vendors.

‘The Board of Health engaged in law-making beyond its
regulatory authority,’ the opinion reads. ‘... It is clear that the Board of
Health wrote the Portion Cap Rule without benefit of legislative guidance.’

Gulp: New York's highest court dismissed New York City's appeal to reinstate the Bloomberg-era ban on large sugary soft drinks. In this March 2013 photo, then-Mayor Bloomberg gazes at one of the 64-ounce cups he so vocally despised

The city had hoped Thursday's ruling would overturn a lower
court's decision that blocked the restrictions after restaurants, theater
owners, beverage companies and small stores sued.

‘We are pleased that the lower courts' decisions were
upheld,’ the American Beverage Association said in a statement after the
decision was handed down. The restrictions, if reinstated, ‘would have created
an uneven playing field for thousands of small businesses in the city and
limited New Yorkers' freedom of choice.’

City Health Commission Mary T. Bassett said the
administration of current Mayor Bill de Blasio continues to look for ways ‘to
limit the pernicious effects of aggressive and predatory marketing of sugary
drinks and unhealthy foods.’

Victory: Former partial-term Alaska Governor and failed VP candidate Sarah Palin famously mocked Bloomberg's ban in 2013. Now she and her supporters have won a victory

‘Today's ruling does not change the fact that sugary drink
consumption is a key driver of the obesity epidemic, and we will continue to
look for ways to stem the twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes,’
Bassett said.

The case was decided 4-2, with the majority opinion written
by Judge Eugene Piggott Jr. Piggott wrote that city health regulators appeared
to carefully weigh the economic, social and health implications of the ban — a
policy function that Piggott wrote was not the health board's to exercise. The
two dissenting judges wrote that they believe the Board of Health was within
its rights to impose the ban, and that the judiciary shouldn't ‘step into the
middle of a debate over public health policy.’

The city hasn't said whether it plans to try to appeal. But
it's unlikely that an appeal to the Supreme Court would be accepted because the
case centers on local government authority and legislation, not federal issues.

Mayor Bloomberg spoke out on the decision Thursday and
condemned the judge for making the decision despite 'irrefutable' evidence that
sugary drinks are horrible for consumers' health.

'We are extremely disappointed by today’s Court decision
that prevents the city from implementing a sugary drink portion cap policy,' he
said, while noting his team is still in the process of examining the court's
decision.

Soda has been under fire for years, with health advocates
saying the sugary beverages are unique in their harmfulness because people
don't realize how much high-fructose corn syrup they're guzzling. The bad publicity
has helped lead to a steady decline in U.S. soda sales for nearly a decade. But
other sugary drinks such as sports drinks and energy drinks have been growing.

To help curb consumption, lawmakers and health advocates
around the country have proposed soda taxes in recent years. None have
succeeded, however, in part because of heavy campaigning and lobbying from the
beverage industry. In California, a measure that would have slapped a warning
label on sodas was recently defeated.

In the meantime, Coke and Pepsi have also been rolling out
smaller cans and bottles, some as small as 7.5 ounces. The idea is that people
would be more willing to drink soda if they could control the portion sizes.
The smaller sizes are also more profitable for companies.

Lost cause: Bill de Blasio picked up Bloomberg's pet soda cause when he took the reigns of the city, but his hopes for getting the ban reinstated were permanently dashed Thursday
