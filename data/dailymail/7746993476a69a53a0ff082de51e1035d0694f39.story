Two food-loving students have come up with an ingenious way to tempt unadventurous peers into the kitchen with the creation of a naked cookbook.

Kinvara Hubbard and Mimi Williams decided to bare all in a brave bid to coax their fellow students away from the bar.

The two, who are both 21 and childhood friends from Cambridge, came up with the quirky concept after realising traditional cookbooks were gathering dust in university accommodation across the country.

Budding chefs: Kinvara is a Philosophy student at the University of Edinburgh and Mimi is midway through a four-year course studying French and Law at the University of Leeds

The book, which also features a number of the girls' student friends in the altogether, includes everything from nude skiers at the top of Arthur’s Seat, a giant peak in Edinburgh, to stripped-down sportsmen pumping iron in a gym in Leeds, all spicing up the pages of the cookbook, which otherwise offers fairly bog-standard recipes like bean casserole and spaghetti Bolognese.

The girls, whose book has already stirred a lot of interest amongst fellow students, admitted it was not hard finding willing volunteers for their project.

Kinvara said: 'Everyone asks if it was tough to find students who were willing to strip, but that was the easy part - it was getting them to put their clothes back on that was the hard part.

'We were at a party where we realised we had all been given a cookbook by our parents when we went away to university but out of 30 of us only two had even opened them.

'It's amazing how clueless students are when it comes to cooking - I had one friend who even asked me how to peel a carrot once.

'Mimi and I had picked up some kitchen skills during a summer catering job so that night we decided to come up with a way of making cooking fun and making a cookbook that appealed to students.

'We thought we’d try and emphasise the social aspect of cooking and bring back dinner parties as students love to watch Come Dine With Me.

'Hopefully the pictures are eye-catching enough to make sure the book isn’t just used as a coffee coaster for three years.

'It’s a cookbook put together by students, for students, so it’s completely idiot proof.'

Both girls admit to having no previous experience in publishing before releasing The Naked Student Cookbook this month.

Mimi added: 'It’s been a steep learning curve.

Fun way to learn: Alongside the quirky pictures are simple recipes for student staples including spaghetti bolognese, curry, toad in the hole and even a step-by-step guide on how to boil an egg

'We’ve had to learn to balance degree work and finishing the cookbook which has definitely been tough - especially during our exams.

'We had a lot of late nights and a lot of help from friends and family but it’s been fun throughout.'

Kinvara added: 'Both our universities were very supportive and all our friends got involved.

'One photoshoot involved the rugby team with cakes tactically placed to cover their modesty.

'Afterwards the whole team went outside and played a game of naked rugby out on the field despite it being a freezing day in February.

'We had 60 of our friends strip off during a crazy two weeks of photoshoots - it was the most surreal fortnight of my life but the end result was definitely worth it.'

The girls are donating £1 from every book sold to homeless charity Crisis in recognition of the work they do in university cities across the country.

So far 1,000 copies of the book have been printed for sale thanks to an entrepreneurial scholarship grant but the girls hope to soon attract a big name publisher so their cookbook can hit book shops UK.
