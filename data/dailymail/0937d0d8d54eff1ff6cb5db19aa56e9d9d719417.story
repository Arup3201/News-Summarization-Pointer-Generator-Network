A unique collection of pictures taken during the early days of photography have given a rare insight into Victorian Britain.

The 350 images were taken by amateur photographer Emma Johnston, who is considered to be one of the 19th century's lost figures of the art form.

Experts say very little is known about the middle class woman apart from the fact she lived in Hampstead.

Many of her photogrpahs show the long list of visitors she welcomed to the Manor House, where she lived with her unmarried father.

The first photographic images were taken in Britain in 1834 with the common process for developing pictures beginning in 1841.

Miss Johnston's pictures are believed to have been taken between 1858 and 1864.

The collection of Miss Johnston's pictures are set to go under the hammer at Bonhams in London where they could fetch up to £15,000

Next month, the pictures are set to go under the hammer  at Bonhams in London, where they could fetch up to £15,000.

Mathew Haley, Bonhams Head of Books, said: 'Emma Johnston stands in a great tradition of Victorian women photographers.

'Unlike her famous contemporaries, Lady Hawarden, admired for her technical and artistic achievements and Julia Margaret Cameron, who gained recognition for her celebrity portraits, Emma was chiefly concerned with the daily round of her own social circle which may explain why this most talented of amateurs has been unjustly neglected.'

At the time, although Hampstead was not part of London, many big names visited the house. 

These included William Wardell, the architect of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney and St Patrick's in Melbourne, Frederick Edwards the geologist-palaeontologist and George Waterhouse curator at London Zoo. 

They were also joined by many other diplomats and painters of the time.
