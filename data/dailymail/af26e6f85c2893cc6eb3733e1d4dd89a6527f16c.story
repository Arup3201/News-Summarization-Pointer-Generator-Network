The world's smallest water lily, which was narrowly saved from extinction by experts, has been plucked from Kew Gardens by green-fingered thieves.

Known by Kew botanists as the ‘pygmy Rwandan water lily’, the invaluable and extremely rare tiny Nymphaea Thermarum was taken from a green house on Thursday.

The specimen, which has flowers smaller than a pound coin and pads just a fraction larger, was wrenched or dug out of its shallow pond in the Prince of Wales Conservatory.

The horticultural heist took place some time between 8am and 3pm in an area hidden from CCTV.

The plant was saved from extinction in 2009 when the Kew team nurtured a new generation of plants from seed.

The gardens in Richmond, Surrey, are one of just two locations in the world where the bog-loving plant is grown after it completely disappeared in the wild.

It only grows in damp mud rather than water.

Richard Barley, Director of Kew Gardens’ Horticulture, said: 'You can’t put a price on it by virtue of its rarity.

'One can’t go down to the local garden centre and buy another one.'

Kew Gardens are keeping an open mind who the thief could be, but Mr Barley said: 'The plant was taken when we were open, so it is likely that it was a member of public.

'Someone took the plant when no-one was in the area, although unfortunately there was no CCTV watching them.

'Our staff are dedicated to the conservation of plants and when incidents of this nature occur it is a blow to morale.

'We take theft of our invaluable scientific collection of plants very seriously and this matter is with the Metropolitan Police.'

For years Kew Gardens has battled with plant enthusiasts who take cuttings from the rare and important plants to grow at home.

Mr Barley said: 'Any person who unlawfully removes plant material from the gardens is a serious problem.

'The plants we have here at Kew are here for special conservation purposes and are of scientific value.

'Of course they are also here for the enjoyment of our visitors and it it not something we take lightly.

'The plants that Kew holds are of high conservation value so the message is clear, that this is something that we are seeking to prevent.'

The 'thermal' water lily, which grew around freshwater hot springs, was discovered in 1987 by German botanist Professor Eberhard Fischer and was found in just one location in Mashyuza, in southwest Rwanda.

Police officers investigating the theft have been told by experts at Kew Gardens, in Richmond pictured, that the plant would have had to have been dug or pulled up from the shallow pond in the Prince of Wales Conservatory

It disappeared in the wild two years ago due to over-exploitation of the hot spring that fed this fragile habitat.

Mr Barley added: 'It’s a plant that was once thought to have disappeared.

'A small number were found again in one location in Rwanda, but they completely disappeared from that location a couple of years ago.

'There were 30 of the plants on display in the conservatory at the time, but the material that’s held at Kew and at a botanical garden in Germany is all there is in the world.'

Police have launched an investigation into the theft and appealed for the public’s help in tracing the lily’s whereabouts.

A Scotland Yard spokesperson: 'At some time between 8.30am and 2.55pm on Thursday, 9 January a ‘Nymphaea Thermarum’ was stolen from the Princess of Wales Conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.

'Officers have been informed that the plant would have had to have been dug, or pulled up, from a shallow water lily pond.

'Anyone with information is asked to contact the CID on Richmond-Upon-Thames Borough on 020 8721 5934.'
