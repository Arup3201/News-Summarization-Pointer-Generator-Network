If you're a fan of Zara, you'll be happy to hear that the fashion family is expanding. Sister brand Stradivarius, already a hit in 60 countries around the world, is heading for the UK.

Stradivarius is aimed at women aged 20 to 35 and will be opening its first store in Westfield Shopping Centre in London's Stratford.

So what can we expect from the brand? Its mission is to create informal and 
imaginative collections aimed at young, 
urban, trend-conscious women.

A taste of what's to come: Print dress £29.99 (left) and striped crop-top, £4.99 (right) are both currently available on the Stradivarius website

And with T-shirts starting under £5 and dresses from £19.99, a Stradivarius shopping spree won't break the bank either.

If you can't wait to see the store's offerings in person, you can already shop online at stradivarius.com.

Established in 1994, the young, fun fashion brand was 
acquired by the Inditex group in 1999 and rapidly expanded.

Zara, (above left in Westfield Shopping Centre Stratford), has been gracing our High Street since 1998 and will soon be joined by Stradivarius (pictured in Spain, above right), which opens it's first store in Westfield, Stratford, later this year

Last year, sales for the fashion brand topped a billion Euros (£813 million) making a tidy profit for its owners, who also own Zara, Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Pull & Bear.

The UK launch is a great indication of the global faith in our shopping economy. According to the Office of National Statistics spending has increased for six consecutive months and it seems retail giants like Inditex are keen to cash in.

It may seem like it's been on our High Street forever, but Zara's first store only opened in London in 1998, followed by Massimo Dutti, Bershaka, Pull & Bear and now Stradivarius.

Mother company Inditex now has a total of 6,300 stores across 87 different countries around the world. We say, the more the merrier!
