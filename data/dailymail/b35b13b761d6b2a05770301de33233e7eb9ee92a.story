It's a simple glass bottle with a red top that has become a symbol of soy sauce in Japan and much of the world.

More than half a century after its creation, the Kikkoman soy sauce bottle remains a familiar and comforting shape on restaurant and dining room tables in many countries.

Sumi Murayama, 71, has purchased soy sauce in the bottles since she opened a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo 40 years ago.

'The best part of the bottle is its smart red cap, which doesn't drip,' she said. 'Its simplicity perfectly fits a downtown restaurant like this.'

The bottle's designer, Kenji Ekuan, died Saturday of a heart condition at age 85.

Kikkoman, the world's largest soy sauce brewer, said the bottle helped bring its brand out of the kitchen into restaurants and dining rooms. It says it has sold 400 million bottles around the world since its creation in 1961.

Hot commodity: Kikkoman, the world's largest soy brewer, says it has sold 400 million bottles of soy sauce around the world since its creation in 1961

Remembered: Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday

Ekuan, who is a former monk, crafted his iconic tabletop soy sauce bottle for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. He went on to design the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan 

Ekuan's works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser.

His office, GK Industrial Design Group, said Monday that Ekuan died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday.

A former monk, Ekuan crafted his iconic tabletop bottle, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961.

The New York Times reported that before the dispenser's final design was achieved, Ekuan spent three years working on the project -- and also created 100 prototypes. 

He won international popularity both for the handy, flask-shaped dispenser and of course for the salty brown condiment that flavored many Asian cuisines.

The Tokyo native has said he wanted to design a small bottle because of his childhood memory of his mother pouring soy sauce from a big half-gallon bottle to a tabletop dispenser.

His dispenser has been used ever since,  the New York Times reported in 2012. At the time, the newspaper reported that over 300 million bottles had been sold globally. 

Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) curator Paola Antonelli explained to NPR this week why the bottle is included in the museum's collection.

'The bottle is in the collection because it is working perfectly,' Antonelli said. 'I mean, you've never found a clogged spout, I don't think, even if you leave the soy sauce there in your fridge for a long time.

'And also, this beautiful, sensible and extremely graceful design is at the same time ancient and extremely contemporary.'

Anttonelli also said on the radio program that 'soy sauce was really important for the identity of Japan after the Second World War. It was a way to actually recover an international profile. 

'And originally, the soy sauce was sold in really big bottles. And Kenji was put in charge to package it in a way that could be understood and exported to the whole world. And he did succeeded.'

Other of Ekuan's renowned works include the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos.

His designs originate from the sights of Hiroshima’s devastation after the U.S. atomic bombing of the city 70 years ago.

He heard the voices of street cars, bicycles and other objects mangled and abandoned, saying they had to have been utilized more, he is quoted as saying in a company pamphlet for his Hiroshima exhibit last year. 

His design principle was a 'democratization' of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone. Ekuan wanted to become a maker of everyday things.

Before entering the design world, however, Ekuan became a monk at a Hiroshima temple to succeed his father, who died due to radiation from the atomic bombing.

But he eventually changed his path. He graduated from the prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1955 and went on to get a degree from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

He founded his design studio in 1957. 

The Huffington Post reported that that the studio is now called GK Design Group, and features a total of twelve firms that focus on different types of design.

Last year, Ekuan received a prestigious Italian industrial design prize, the Golden Compass Award, after winning several other international awards.

When telling Japan Times about his designs in 2001, he said: 'Design to me has always meant making people happy. 

'Happy in the sense of creating items that provide comfort, convenience, function, aesthetics and ethics. 

'I used to do a lot of research, fieldwork, wanting to understand the psychology of human needs and response.’

He also designed Yamaha motorcycles, like the one pictured above. His design principle was a ‘democratization’ of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone
