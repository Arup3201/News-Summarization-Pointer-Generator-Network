A french businessman who realised his childhood dream to relocate to a desert island has been driven home by wild Indonesian creatures and unaffordable phone bills.

Gauthier Toulemonde, 54, had been getting increasingly frustrated with his stagnant life commuting from Lille to Paris every day to his office job as a publicist.

Last Christmas, the sorry sight of distinctly un-merry Parisians lugging presents through the station compelled him to finally take a leap.

Deserted: Gauthier Toulemonde, 54, relocated his work as a publicist to one of Indonesia's 17,000 islands

Moving to one of Indonesia's 17,000 islands like Robinson Crusoe moved to Trinidad, Mr Toulemonde 'detoxed from modern life' by scavenging for food, being in touch with nature, and having little to no contact with other human beings.

His only companion was Gecko, a dog borrowed from a Chinese woman, to scare off the wildlife.

He told The Guardian he wanted to be the first 'Web Robinson' to persuade French people to abandon the tiring, demoralising commute and work remotely.

He added: 'I found myself in Gare Saint Lazare in Paris just before Christmas watching the continuous stream of people passing by.

Idyllic: He was bound by Indonesian law to keep the exact location of the 700x500-metre island a secret

'Web Robinson': Toulemonde filmed his experiment testing if it was possible to work this far from the office

'They had this sad look on their faces, even though they were carrying Christmas presents. It had long seemed to me absurd this travelling back and forth to offices.

'My idea of going away had been growing for a while, but it was on that day, I decided to leave.'

It took him six months - and numerous run-ins with the Indonesian government - to find the perfect uninhabited island for a six-week trial run. Although he managed to persuade officials to let him go, he was ordered by law not to reveal the exact location of the hideaway, that is just 700-by-500 metres.

Finally, in October he set off - with just a tent, four solar panels, a phone, a laptop, rice and pasta for supplies.

Every day he woke at 5am and went to bed at midnight.

He would scavenge for vegetables on the island and fish in the sea before simply reclining to 'detox from modern life'.

'Those days, for me it was like being in quarantine,' he told Le Figaro.

'I used the time as a detox from modern life.'

He told Paris Match: 'What gave me most joy was living - stripped bare - in the closest possible contact with nature. Every day was magical.'

However, it was not stress-free: his company had to publish two editions of Stamps Magazine.

Snakes: Toulemonde was surrounded by Indonesia's wildlife ranging from small snakes to giant pythons

Rats: He said living on the island with pests such as rats for any more than 40 days would be too much to handle

Diary: He wrote a blog and made videos tracking his progress. He admitted he won't go out again

He allowed himself 20 euros a day for internet to email his employees - and abandoned extortionate phone calls early on.

But after completing his trial, Mr Toulemonde has conceded that he cannot do it forever.

Although he claims the 'telecommuting' experiment was a success, he told French broadcasters My TF1 News that the snakes and rats were intolerable - and fear of losing Internet connection was even worse.

The biggest challenge was lack of human contact.

He said: 'Telecommuting really works but doing everything virtually has its limits. Working from distance might be doable, but nothing can replace human contact.'
