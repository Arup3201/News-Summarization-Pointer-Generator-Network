Hunted: An artist's impression shows a primitive Yeti emerging from a cave

Hunters are claiming they have discovered the nest of a legendary Yeti tucked away in a remote area of Russia.

And experts are hailing the discovery of bizarrely twisted trees in the Kemerovo region as the final piece in the puzzle to prove the abominable snowman is real.

Experts stumbled across the trees, twisted by force to form an arch, in the area -which is known for sightings of the wildman.

And Yeti experts who met at a conference in Moscow to discuss the find mounted an exhibition to Siberia to see the nest for themselves.

Biologist John Bindernagel, 69, told The Sun, 'We didn't feel like the trees we saw in Siberia had been done by a man or another mammal.

'Twisted trees like this have also been observed in North America and they could fit in with the theory that Bigfoot makes nests.'

Sightings of the Yeti have been reported in France, North America and the Himalayas but Dr Bindernagel said these are mainly ignored by scientists who are put off by 'jokes and taboos.'

He told The Sun: 'I am nearly 70 so time is running out for me.'

The latest discovery comes a month after Russian officials said they found ‘indisputable evidence’ that yetis exist.

Their claim followed an international conference and expedition to track down the Abominable Snowman in the Mount Shoria area.

However, doubt was already been cast over the ‘find’ – as the team has no convincing photographic or DNA evidence.

Their claim appears to be based a single unclear footprint and a small sample of grey ‘hair’, found in a cave.

The administration of the Kemerovo region, where the cave is situated, yesterday announced that ‘indisputable evidence’ had been found.

But critics said the expedition was more about making the area a tourist destination than true science.

Evidence: Vladimir Makouta, head of Siberia's Tastagol district administration, and the sheriff of the area's Kabyrza settlement, show twisted aspen branches believed to have been caused by a Yeti

Made by a legend? Experts say these arches prove a Yeti has been trawling the region and had nested nearby

On the trail: this strange footprint found in the snow was also hailed as proof the Yeti exists

Researchers who led the search said that they are closer than ever to catching one the creatures.

'During
the expedition to the Azasskaya cave, conference participants gathered 
indisputable proof that the Shoria mountains are inhabited by the Snow 
Man,' the Kemerovo region administration announced yesterday.

'They found his footprints, his supposed bed, and various markers with which the Yeti uses to denote his territory.'

The
markers appeared to be mainly broken trees and some Russian media 
reports have treated the Yeti claims with considerable scepticism.

Despite
this, the local government officials professed themselves either 
certain or 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yeti in a highland 
area known as Mount Shoria.

The hair thought to be from a Yeti was found in the Kemerovo region 2,600 miles east of Moscow

The
first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists 
who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas.

They
depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and 
carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound.

Popular 
interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists 
began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. 
They reported seeing strange markings in the snow.

The
Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to 
Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson 
photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the 
snow.

A number of hair 
samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti 
scalp.

British
mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when 
scaling Annapurna in 1970.

An American housewife told a previous conference she regularly feeds Yeti in her back garden in Michigan but was unable to produce a single photograph of an elusive creature rumoured to exist for thousands of years.

One cynical Russian media report summed up the mission as 'we haven't actually found anything, but we very, very much wanted to have found something'.

Shortly before the 'experts' arrived, another hunt to the same cave to find the Yeti was led by the 'Beast of the East' - former Russian heavyweight boxing champion Nikolai Valuyev. It ended in failure, though locals saw it as a key plank in the region's bid to boost tourism.

'Valuyev did not manage to meet the Yeti itself but on the way he discovered 'traces' such as broken tree branches,' said a spokesman.

'I saw lots of journalists but no Yetis,' admitted the boxer.

Dmitry Islamov, Vice Governor of Kemerovo Region on Economics and Regional Development said: 'It doesn't matter that the Kuzbass might not have Yetis. The main thing is that when people come to the Shoria Mountains, they truly enjoy its unique nature.'

Twisted branches found in Kemerovo region could finally prove Yeti is no longer the stuff of legends
