Men will be banned from visiting a waterfall at a lake being developed as a major tourist attraction in Malaysia.

Terengganu is to rebrand Tasik Kenyir, the largest artificial lake in Southeast Asia, as women-only in a £54m development project.

The move in the country's northeast would mean only women could transport guests to the waterfall by boat - and women security guards would be used to patrol the area.

It comes after a request from women tourists from West Asia, according to spokesman Datuk Seri Ahmad.

He said banning men from one of the many waterfalls in the area was one of measures being taken to promote the lake, sprawled over 260sq-km, with 340 man-made islands, as a unique tourism attraction.

The plans also include turning it into the first duty-free lake in the world. 

Under the redevelopment, several islands have already been completed, with work on a £12.6m jetty now underway.

Ahmad said work on a new four-lane bridge, which would become the main link between Pengkalan Gawi and Pulau Poh Besar would begin soon.

He added the island, which covers about 40 hectares, would also get two jetties, one for passengers and another for cargo.

'We will build a hotel, a water recreation park and a 1,000-bay car park as Pengkalan Gawi does not have a large space for parking,' he said.

'I am confident that Tasik Kenyir can draw the tourists and become a choice tourist destination in the future.'

The Terengganu government, through Ketengah, is targeting about 500,000 tourists to the the lake, which last year attracted about 400,000 tourists.
