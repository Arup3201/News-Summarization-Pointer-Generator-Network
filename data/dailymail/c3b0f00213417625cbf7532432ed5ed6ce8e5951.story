The man who eliminated post-sandwich guilt with a bread made almost entirely out of broccoli has added a pizza to his collection of healthy carbs.

Paul Shackleton, a London-based City banker-turned-baker who launched Plan Bread - a sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb-free, low calorie super-bread made from broccoli - has expanded his range.

Paul, who was made redundant from his job as a trader at JP Morgan two years ago, said it took hundreds of prototypes and 
samples before perfecting his broccoli pizza recipe.

Is this the world's healthiest pizza? A banker-turned-baker has created broccoli pizza, which has 50 per cent fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than other 'healthy' pizzas

Using all-natural produce and broccoli
 as the main ingredient, the result is, according to independent assessments, by some distance the lowest-calorie, lowest-carb pizza 
available in the UK.

Plan Bread’s special gluten-free recipe has 50 per cent 
fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than the average 'healthy' pizzas on 
the market. 

As a comparison, 100g of popular thin and crispy pizzas have,
 on average, 260 calories and 29g carbohydrate while 100g of the broccoli pizza has 125 calories and 2g of carbohydrate.

Speaking about his latest foodie creation, which is available with chicken, salami and mozzarella toppings, Paul said: 'We were really proud of the broccoli bread product that was launched last year, but were unsure of how many people would embrace the concept.

'Lots of people signed up immediately for our lunchtime sandwich delivery service, which has now grown to incorporate clients such as Virgin Active and the BBC. It showed us that there must be an unfulfilled desire for people to seek healthy options to what are, on the whole, not the healthiest products.

'The pizza was the next clear opponent. The trials have gone very promisingly and we are thrilled to launch the broccoli pizza product.'

Despite having no experience in 
oven-based work, the 28-year-old set himself the challenge of creating 
the world's healthiest bread.

He
 spent hours poring over books in the British Library, studying the 
latest medical research on how food is stored as fat, and meticulously 
devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at Plan Bread's secret 
recipe.

'When we 
were devising the original bread recipe we were adamant on all the 
ingredients being gluten-free,' he explained. 'This was an effort to 
make the bread accessible to more people. However, we have been 
contacted by masses of people who are looking for gluten-free solutions 
to baked goods that are on the market at present.

'The scale
 of the need for coeliac appropriate products seems to far outstrip both
 the availability and quality of what is currently on offer. We’re 
hoping, in our own small way, to help increase the choice for what seems
 to be a vastly underestimated and underrepresented party of eaters.

'In the 
long term, we’d love to tackle as many flour based products as possible 
and give our healthy interpretation of them. We already have a broccoli 
flour scotch egg, but perhaps a range of pies or other savoury items.'

Plan Bread
 delivers platters, individual sandwiches, pizzas and healthy snacks to 
addresses across London as well as stocking shops, gyms and canteens.

Bianca London says: 'If there was one food I had to eat forever it would be bread, followed closely by pizza.

'So when I found out about Plan Bread, I was more than excited at the prospect of actually being able to do "carbs before marbs".

'It's a cross between an omelette, eggy bread and brioche. On first tasting it, I wasn't convinced, but with more bites, the pizza tasted really good and with the right toppings, tastes very close to the real thing - without the guilt.

'I'm, controversially, not a fan of a good old greasy Domino's so this is the perfect guilty fix for dieters who are partial to 
committing the occasional carbicide.'

Martha Cliff, Femail's resident foodie, says: 'Whenever I am convinced to choke back a health food of any sort I am always a little dubious, particularly when it is a piece of pizza with less than 200 calories, absolutely no carbs and that counts towards one of your five-a-day.

'The broccoli-based pizza is not exactly like taking a bite out of deep-pan Hawaiian but it is tasty. French toast-like in texture, it is light and spongy and there is definitely a hint of broccoli to the flavour (or perhaps that's just me overthinking the green base?)

'Most importantly, there is cheese, real cheese, and tomato sauce - and in my books if you can eat pizza with CHEESE on a diet you're on to a winner.'

Mail on Sunday features writer Charlie Lankston, who sampled the broccoli Scotch egg, says: 'The Scotch egg actually went down a treat with everyone here.

'It tastes way better than it looks and smells and everyone was thrilled at the thought of a low-calorie Scotch egg. We’re wondering whether there’s a low-calorie sausage roll to go with it?'
