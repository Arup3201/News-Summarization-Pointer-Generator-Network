There can be nothing better than cosying up on the sofa with your partner to watch a good flick.

But be careful what you pick as a partner's terrible film choice is among some of the biggest causes of conflict within a relationship.

Disgusting bathroom habits, messy eating and being glued to social media also come high on the list of irritations that are currently driving couples mad.

The average person now spends 590 minutes watching movies they hate every year just to avoid a row. Men come off the worst with 80 per cent admitting to biting their lip over a film choice each month, while 23 per cent of women go along with rubbish flicks to keep their partner happy.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, rom-coms like Love Actually are the worst offenders when it comes to film hates for men, while women find horror flicks such as Saw a real turn-off.

First dates prove to be the most awkward scenario, with 13 per cent of people confessing to having gone along with a choice to make a good impression.

Even celebrity couple Kian Egan and wife Jodi Albert admitted they had very different tastes when it came to picking a flick to watch.

Westlife singer and King of the Jungle star, Kian, said: 'Of course I love a movie night in with Jodi but we don't have the same taste in films. I like action thrillers and she's more of a rom-com girl.'

Jodi added: 'I admit I am guilty of making Kian sit through a few rom-coms now and then but I have had to watch my fair share of film flops. It would be nice to spend Christmas season without watching any turkeys!'

But it's not just our partner's film choices that can leave us fuming. 

The research, carried out by crisps company Pringles, revealed the number one irritation for couples is clothes being left lying on the floor. The lazy habit is something which winds up more women than men, with 34 per cent of ladies feeling the frustration compared to 19 per cent of guys.

Rows about bad bathroom habits also feature at number 3 with leaving hairs in the shower plug (26 per cent) the top gripe.

Being glued to our mobiles was the fourth largest irritation. Surfing social networks at the dinner table was by far the worst offence (20 per cent), followed by using their phone in bed (20 per cent) and whilst watching a film (19 per cent).

Other moans which made the top ten included messy eating habits such as eating crisps in bed, leaving dirty plates out and drinking and eating straight out of the fridge.
