Manchester United fans have picked goalkeeper David de Gea as the club's Player of the Month for October, with the Spaniard picking a whopping 70 per cent of the votes in an online poll.

Despite failing to keep a clean sheet during the month, De Gea was in fine form as United beat Everton before drawing away at West Brom and at home to Premier League leaders Chelsea.

The 23-year-old kept out a Leighton Baines penalty and pulled off two memorable late saves to deny the Toffees a point at Old Trafford, before notably thwarting Eden Hazard when the Belgian was clear through on goal during United's 1-1 draw with Jose Mourinho's side.

After receiving his glass trophy on Friday, De Geat told ManUtd.com: 'I feel very good. I know we have one of the best fan bases in the world and they believe in me, which is good for me.

'I am very happy with them. They have supported me in every game and they are always behind me. They are amazing.'

Perhaps De Gea's most important save in October arrived against Roberto Martinez's side when he flung himself across goal to save Bryan Oviedo's impressive volley in added time.

The save ensured Louis van Gaal's side earned a second consecutive win, something which was not lost on the former Atletico Madrid stopper.

Speaking about keeping out the Costa Rican's effort, De Gea said: 'I think every save is important for the goalkeepers and for the team, but maybe in this game the save in the last minute can be the most important save, perhaps more than the penalty in the first half.'
