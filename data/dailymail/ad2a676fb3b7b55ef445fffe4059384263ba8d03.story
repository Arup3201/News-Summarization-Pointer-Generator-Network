Much of the city may be without power, but nothing can stop the Apple enthusiasts of New York queuing for the company’s latest gadget.

Modest lines of customer looking to secure a new $329 mini iPad formed outside the company’s flagship store on Fifth Avenue.

Eytan Friedman, 43, who is living in the area of the downtown Manhattan without power, told the Wall Street Journal: ‘I'm down by Union Square, and there's no electricity, it's just very hard to sleep, so I figured I'd get up early and get my new iPad rather than lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.’

But around the world, queues were much smaller than for previous Apple launches.

While a few diehard fans queued for hours to be among the first to own the new smaller iPad, queues were tiny compared to previous launches.

In Hong Kong, reports even claim that staff outnumbered the customers when the store opened.

Experts say bad weather, Hurricane Sandy and increased competition from rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft could be behind to lack of queues.

Experts believe the effects of Hurricane Sandy and the large number of online orders mean the queues were smaller.

Apple fans lined up in several Asian cities to get their hands on the iPad mini on Friday, but the device, priced above rival gadgets from Google and Amazon.com, attracted smaller crowds than at the company's previous global rollouts.

Apple Inc's global gadget rollouts are typically high-energy affairs drawing droves of buyers who stand in line for hours.

But a proliferation of comparable rival devices may have sapped some interest.

About 50 people waited for the Apple store in Sydney, Australia, to open, where in the past the line had stretched for several blocks when the company debuted new iPhones.

At the head of Friday's line was Patrick Li, who had been waiting since 4:30 am and was keen to get his hands on the 7.9-inch slate.

'It's light, easy to handle, and I'll use it to read books. It's better than the original iPad,' Li said.

There were queues of 100 or more outside Apple stores in Tokyo and Seoul when the device went on sale, but when the company's flagship Hong Kong store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line.

The iPad mini marks Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment, and the latest salvo in a global mobile-device war that has engulfed combatants from Internet search leader Google Inc to Web retailer Amazon.com Inc and software giant Microsoft Corp.

Microsoft's 10-inch Surface tablet, powered by the just-launched Windows 8 software, went on sale in October, while Google and Amazon now dominate sales of smaller, 7-inch multimedia tablets.

Unveiled last week, the iPad mini has 
won mostly positive reviews, with criticism centring on a screen 
considered inferior to rivals' and a lofty price tag.

The new tablet essentially replicates most of the features of its full-sized sibling, but in a smaller package.

'Well,
first of all it's so thin and light and very cute - so cute!" said iPad
mini customer Ten Ebihara at the Apple store in Tokyo's upscale Ginza 
district.

Also on Friday, 
Apple rolled out its fourth-generation iPad, with the same 9.7-inch 
display as the previous version but with a faster A6X processor and 
better Wi-Fi. Both devices were going on sale in more than 30 countries.

Apple
will likely sell between 1 million and 1.5 million iPad minis in the 
first weekend, far short of the 3 million third-generation iPads sold 
last March in their first weekend, according to Piper Jaffray analyst 
Gene Munster.

'The reason we
expect fewer iPad minis compared to the 3rd Gen is because of the lack 
of the wireless option and newness of the smaller form factor for 
consumers,' Munster said in a note to clients.

'We believe that over time that will change.'

Reviewers
have applauded Apple for squeezing most of the iPad's features into a 
smaller package that can be comfortably manipulated with one hand.

the Sydney store to buy the iPhone 5, only stood in line for an hour and

'I had an iPad 1 before, I kind of miss it because I sold it about a year ago.

'It's
just more practical to have the mini because I found it a bit too big. 
The image is really good and it's got the fast A5 chip too,' Vohradsky 
said.

The iPad was launched 
in 2010 by late Apple boss Steve Jobs and since then it has taken a big 
chunk out of PC sales, upending the industry and reinventing mobile 
computing with its apps-based ecosystem.

A
smaller tablet is the first device to be added to Apple's compact 
portfolio under Cook, who took over from Jobs just before his death a 
year ago. Analysts credit Google and Amazon for influencing the 
decision.

Some investors 
worry that Apple might have lost its chief visionary with Jobs, and that
new management might not be able to stay ahead of the pack as rivals 
innovate and encroach on its market share.

There
were queues of 100 or more outside Apple stores in Tokyo and Seoul when
the device went on sale, but when the company's flagship Hong Kong 
store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line.
