She is better know for strutting her stuff on the catwalks of the world.

But Laura Bailey was at Heathrow today to launch the new-look Terminal 5 after a £40million makeover.

The style icon, model and author Laura Bailey was on hand to launch the airport's new array of high-end shops for fashionable flyers, from Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Rolex to Fortnum & Mason and Bottega Veneta.

After a £41 million investment and 18 months of renovation, Heathrow's Terminal 5 has now reopened

The star donned a midi-length cream dress and tan-coloured sandals to strut along the terminal's walkways, clutching a shopaholic's dream collection of bags.

The terminal now has a collection of 22 fashion and luxury brands, each newly-redesigned to remain on-brand with their flagship location.

The first Fortnum & Mason store and bar at an airport is another exciting addition to Heathrow.

At the exclusive bar, customers will be able to indulge in Fortnum's famous selection of tea, or enjoy a glass of champagne, before browsing the latest fashion-forward styles.
