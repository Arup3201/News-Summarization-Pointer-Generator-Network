Losing your friends and dancing alone among tens of thousands of people at a festival isn’t fun.

But it could be a thing of the past if a trial of electronic tags proves successful.

Orange tags worn by festival goers use radio waves to keep track of friends, instead of relying on mobile phone reception, which can be patchy if not non-existent at large outdoor events.

What: Electronic tags are designed to be worn by festival goers.

Why: Up to five people can keep constantly in touch. The main tracking unit connects with up to four tags.

How: The tags use radio waves to determine people's locations and guide the person with the main tag to their friends, by following beeps and flashing lights to point them in the right direction.

Range: 1,640ft or 500 metres.

On trial: The device was used last weekend at Global Gathering near Stratford-upon-Avon. IT will be trialled at Kendal Calling in Cumbria, Bloodstock in Derbyshire and the Tough Mudder events throughout the UK events in August.

Release date: There is no news whether the prototype device will be launched or when.

Price: No pricing details are available.

The durable devices, which have a long charge, can keep up to five people constantly in touch and have a range of 1,640ft (500metres).

The main tracking unit connects with up to four tags and uses a beeper and LED lights to point the user in the direction of their friends.

It has been dubbed the world’s first festival friend finder by its makers – the spirit brand Jägermeister – and will be used by festival goers at Kendal Calling in Cumbria, Bloodstock in Derbyshire and the Tough Mudder events throughout the UK events in August.

The tags can be attached to festival lanyards and wristbands or can be left at a tent of meeting point to guide festival goers back to a comfortable sleeping bag after a night of dancing.

The Festival Friend Finder has an alert button, which signals to all friends with trackers that its wearer needs help and can also notify them if they've strayed too far from the main stage or their tent.

Robert Turner, from Northampton, was one of the first people to try it out this at Global Gathering, which took place bear Stratford-upon-Avon last weekend.

‘This is a brilliant idea and saved me spending ages trawling through the crowds trying to find the lads and also meant we didn't miss any of the acts we came to see,’ he said.

‘If they make these available to buy, I'm definitely getting one - I don't know how I'll do without it now.’

Samantha Green, Jägermeister Events Manager, said: ‘These events are all about sharing the amazing experience with friends and creating long lasting memories which groups of mates can look back on in years to come, and so we really hope this prototype will be in the hands of all festival-goers one day soon’.

Currently, the Festival Friend Finder gadget is only a prototype under development and there are no details about when it may become available to buy, or how much it might cost.
