A mixed race girl was subjected to monkey taunts by a gang of racist yobs after she accidentally stumbled into a National Front meeting.

The seven-year-old had gone with her parents to a social club in Wavertree, Liverpool, to book their wedding reception but inadvertently walked into a room where 14 far-right activists were discussing group tactics.

The yobs turned round as the girl walked through the door, and as soon as they saw her began shouting: 'F*** off back to where you come from' and started making monkey noises at her, it has been claimed.

The bewildered girl’s mother who is white and father who is from Sierra Leone pulled the youngster out of the room and reported the incident to police.

Enquiries revealed the yobs had taped over CCTV cameras at Wavertree Cricketers Club, but some footage has been recovered by police and is now being studied to identify the culprits.

Today the girl’s parents, aged 30 and 31, said no attempt had been made by club officials to turf the racist yobs out of the venue.

They said the room had been decked out with Union flags and banners emblazoned with nationalist slogans.

In an interview with Liverpool Echo, the girl’s mother, of south Liverpool, said their wedding plans were now in disarray because they would not set foot in the venue again.

They insisted there was no doubt the abuse was directed at their daughter.

The mother said: 'They were shouting and telling her to f*** off back to where she came from and making monkey noises.

'Luckily, she did not really know what was going on, but I’ve brought her up to know that although she has different-coloured skin she is the same as everyone else.

'If she had understood what they were saying it could have scarred her for life.'

Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said: 'This incident has made me sick to the pit of my stomach.

'It’s hard to believe that so-called human beings can stoop to this sort of level. Thankfully the little girl doesn’t seem to have understood what was going on, but these would not have known that, they wouldn’t have given a toss.

Far-right: The National Front supports the expulsion of all non-whites from the UK

'We must be seen to challenge this kind of abhorrent behaviour and be tough on it when it is exposed.'

Detective Inspector Lisa Mahon of Merseyside Police said: 'This has been a very distressing incident for a young girl and her family.

'I share her family's disgust, as clearly this alleged behaviour is not acceptable. A full investigation into the incident is underway and I would urge anyone with any information to come forward.

'We are working closely with the family and are offering them support.

'We have also spoken to residents in the area to reassure them that we are doing all that we can and to see if they have any information that can assist in our investigation.'

The incident, which took place on Wednesday night, is not the first time the Cricketers has been at the centre of a row over far-right extremists.

In 2011, the British National Party booked it for its annual conference, attended by leader Nick Griffin.

The club’s owner Brian Washington said at the time that he had no knowledge that it was the BNP who had hired the venue until they arrived.

Sanctions imposed on the club’s licence by the council were overturned on appeal, with the judge branding them 'excessive and unnecessary'.

Mr Washington said he had not known the National Front had booked the room until they arrived, and was co-operating fully with the police investigation.

He added he was also seeking police advice about his rights to ban the BNP from ever returning.

Mr Washington said: 'The National Front are banned from here for life and as soon as I get an address for them I will be sending them notice of that officially and I will also send a copy to the police.'

He added he had no sympathy with extremism, and at the weekend had an African group booked in to the venue.

The National Front is a far-right, racial nationalist, whites-only political party.

The cornerstone of the National Front's manifesto is the compulsory repatriation of all 'coloured' people in Britain,

The party claims to stand for 'white family values' and the 'Fourteen Words', a white nationalist slogan that states: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children'.

The party works in open cooperation with the white supremacist and neo-Nazi website Stormfront

It put up 17 candidates in the 2010 general election and 18 candidates for the 2010 local elections.

The party failed to gain any representation at either national or local level.

As well as its racist beliefs, the party supports the re-criminalisation of homosexuality.
