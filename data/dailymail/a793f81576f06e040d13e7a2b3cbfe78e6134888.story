Nasa has managed to send an iconic image into space using lasers.

The US space agency beamed Leonardo Da Vinci’s iconic painting, the Mona Lisa from its Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) at the moon.

The image travelled 240,000 miles by piggybacking on laser pulses that are already fired at the spacecraft and are used by the LRO to track the moon's surface.

A digital version of the Mona Lisa has been beamed to space using lasers. The picture was then sent back to Earth using radio waves. Transmission errors distorted the picture but NASA scientists were able to restore it using coding

NASA laser beamed pixels from a digital version of the Mona Lisa 240,000 miles to the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter currently flying round the moon for the first time ever

‘This is the first time anyone has achieved one-way laser communication at planetary distances,’ says principal investigator, David Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

To send the picture, Xiaoli Sun, a Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) scientist at Nasa Goddard, and his colleagues divided the Mona Lisa image into 30,400 pixels.

Each pixel was then turned into a shade of grey, represented by a number between zero and 4,095.

The laser that beamed the Mona Lisa to the moon was sent from the Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging station at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The laser is already used to measure the moon's terrain

Individual pixels were sent using laser pulses fired at LOLA on the LRO, orbiting around the moon.

The pixels were sent in order from top left to bottom right.

And the complete image was sent at a rate of 300 bits per second.

Once the laser pulses were received by the LOLA instrument, it reconstructed the image based on the order each pixel was fired in from Earth.

NASA timed the pulses to make sure the experiment wouldn’t interfere with the LRO's current mission of recording the moon's terrain. 

To test the transmission, the image was then returned to Earth using the spacecraft’s radio telemetry system.

When Sun and his team got the image back, they realised that turbulence in the Earth’s atmosphere had caused transmission errors.

The picture came back in worse quality than it was sent.

To correct the image, Sun used Reed-Solomon coding -  the same type of error-correction code used to fix CD and DVD qualities.

These errors did turn out to be useful, though, because the team could get statistics and learn more about signal fluctuations caused by the Earth's atmosphere. 

 A digital version of the Mona Lisa was divided into 30,400 pixels.

Each
pixel was sent at different time intervals using laser pulses fired at 
the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), on the Lunar Reconnaisance 
Orbiter (LRO) – a spacecraft that orbits the moon and tracks its terrain
and elevation.

LOLA reconstructed the image in the order the pixels were fired.

The image was then sent back to Earth using radio waves.

Because of transmission errors caused by the Earth’s atmosphere, the picture came back distorted.

Scientists used Reed-Solomon coding - technology designed to fix CD and DVD qualities - to restore the image back to its original quality.

Laser technology is already used to send
data from CDs, for example.

NASA said it can now use lasers to speed up delivery of 
data sent from space.

'Because LRO is already set up to receive laser signals through the LOLA instrument, we had a unique opportunity to demonstrate one-way laser communication with a distant satellite,' says Xiaoli Sun.

LRO stands for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

It’s a robotic spacecraft that is orbiting the moon, taking pictures and gathering information about the moon's surface.

It launched in June 2009.

NASA
is using LRO to create maps of the entire lunar surface, including 
searching for water ice that could be used for rocket fuel.

One instrument NASA is using to create 3D maps of the moon is called the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)

LOLA uses lasers to find high and low points on the moon, as well as shadows where ice may be hiding.

This 3D information will show places where it is safe for spacecraft to land.

NASA hopes this experiment will pave the way for lasers to be used as a backup to the current communication technology.

David Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says, 'In the near future, this type of simple laser communication might serve as a backup for the radio communication that satellites use.

In the more distant future, it may allow communication at higher data rates than present radio links can provide."

NASA also plans to develop this technology for getting live, high-definition video feeds from other worlds within the solar system, including Jupiter.

'This achievement sets the stage for the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD).

This is a high data rate, laser-communication demonstration that will be central to NASA's next moon mission' says Goddard's Richard Vondrak, the LRO deputy project scientist.The next step after LLCD is the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD).

This would be NASA's first, long-duration optical communications mission.

LCRD will help develop deep-space communication technologies.
