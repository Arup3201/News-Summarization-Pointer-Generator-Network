A shocking map has revealed the worst areas of the country when it comes to drink driving.

Using data of fatalities over a ten-year period, the size and density of the dots show where all traffic accidents happened.

The color of the dots is indicative of collisions where alcohol was involved - yellow and green signify less DUIs while blue means more. 

The highest density areas from 2001-2010 are located in the North-East and along the West Coast. Florida and Texas also have a huge number of DUI collisions.

The map, created by John Nelson on the IDV Solutions UX Blog, shows some areas are notable for a low-rate of DUI deaths - like Manhattan and Memphis - while others are shockingly high including St Louis, Missouri and across the state of South Carolina.

With each new day in the U.S., 27 more people die because of drunk driving, statistics this year revealed.

More than 1.41 million drivers were arrested in 2010 for driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, according to the FBI.

However this does not come close to those who got away with it. In the same year, drivers got in their cars 112 million times while being over the limit - 300,000 incidents of drinking and driving each day.

Driving under the influence of alcohol was also age-related with the largest group of offenders (23.4 percent) aged 21 to 25.

Some 211 children were killed in drunk driving crashes in 2010 according to statistics from the National Traffic Highway Safety.

Of these, 131 children died while in the car with someone who was driving drunk.
