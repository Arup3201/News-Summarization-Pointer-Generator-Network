A  hiker was rescued by yodeling for help after getting stuck for three hours in a cattle grid.

German walker Martin Kaiser, 54, used to the traditional mountain form of communication after getting stuck in the cattle grid while he was wandering along a remote forest trail leading up the Hochkoenig mountain in the Austrian Pinzgau region.

Tourist Kaiser had been walking with his dog when the animal suddenly stopped at the cattle grid then ran back the way they had come.

As he span around to try to call it back, he lost his footing and one of his legs became trapped.

He said: 'It was incredibly painful and very difficult to move. I couldn't get out at all and so all I could do was wait until someone came along to help me. 

'I eventually decided to yodel for help because there was nothing else to do. 

'I was worried that I might get sunstroke, or suffer damage to my leg because the circulation might have been cut off.

'I certainly didn't want to end up spending the night there.'

In the end he was rescued when a cyclist heard the yodeling hiker and after failing to get him free himself called the emergency services who sent firemen to help.

Despite scratches Kaiser was unhurt and, after being given first aid on the scene, was allowed to continue on his Alpine ramble with his dog.

He added: 'I will make sure I pay more attention to the cattle grid in the future.'
