The Duchess of Cambridge better watch out, there's a new royal poised to steal her style crown.

She may have only come to our attention a few short weeks ago, but Princess Letizia  has already carved out a name for herself as a 
royal style icon, showcasing some serious fashion credentials on every single one of her royal engagements.

The
 41-year-old mother-of-two's wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses, sky-scraping court shoes 
and eye-catching jewels is much more daring than the play-it-safe style of the former Kate Middleton.

Her choice
 of outfit at today's inauguration of the exhibition 'El Ultimo Viaje de
 la Fragata Mercedes' (The Last Voyage of the Frigate Mercedes) at the 
National Archaeological museum in Madrid was case in point.

Walk on the wild side: Princess Letizia jazzed up her conservative outfit with some snakeskin as she and Prince Felipe visited the Archaelogical Museum this afternoon

The glamorous former newsreader may have worn a conservative suit but she still showcased her style credentials with a hint of snakeskin.

The Princess showed her wild side with a snakeskin blouse and matching clutch, which she wore under a cream suit and with beige heels.

She and husband Prince Felipe were attending The Ministries of Education and Defense and Acción Cultural Española's jointly organised exhibition.

The exhibition tells the story of the sinking of the frigate (or warship) called ‘Mercedes’ in 1804, and the tortuous return to Spain of its treasure and cargo after a long legal battle.

The exhibition aims to underline the importance of safeguarding Spain's underwater heritage and will explain the historical context and the circumstances of the sinking of the Spanish Navy ship in 1804.

Since 
marrying Felipe, Prince of Asturias, Prince of Gerona, Prince of Viana, 
Duke of Montblanc, Count of Cervera and Lord of Balaguer, in 2004, Princess Letizia 
wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation.

The Spanish queen-in-waiting also shares
another trait with the UK's future queen: a penchant for homegrown 
labels and the high street. In Letizia's case, that means slim-fitting 
sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she 
wears time and time again.

Watch out, Kate! Princess Letizia may be 41, but her youthful style gives Kate a run for her money

Youthful glow: The Princess has perfectly coiffed hair with soft highlights and shows off a radiant glow despite a hectic schedule

That,
 however, doesn't mean she won't splash out on a more expensive frock 
should one catch her eye. Her favourite piece is reportedly a black 
guipure lace dress by local designer, Felipe Varela, which she wore on a
 state visit to Portugal in 2012, again for her 40th birthday party and 
again in March this year.

Another
 favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by 
Hugo Boss which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being 
dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer.

Off
 duty, the Princess' style becomes markedly more relaxed, with cropped 
trousers, billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the 
bulk of her wardrobe.

But as her occasional foray back into grey Hugo Boss tailored trousers reveals, some style habits die hard - Queen-to-be or not.
