Nastya, who is only seven years old, has moved underground with her parents to escape the fierce shelling of their hometown of Ilovaysk.

The town in eastern Ukraine has become a battleground for pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces who have spent weeks fighting for control of the area.

Nastya shows a camera around her new home, spelling out  letters of the alphabet while reading them off a children's poster.

She pulls a doll out of a plastic bag and strokes its hair.

Nastya tells the camera: 'I have dolls at home, teddy bears and the book with pictures to colour.'

She must now play with them all in the dark.

Her parents sleep here too and the young girl gives a guided tour of their sleeping quarters.  

Ilovaysk is about 28 miles southeast of the rebel stronghold in Donetsk. 

As yet, nobody knows how many Ukrainians have died in Ilovaysk but reports suggest that the battle for the small town outside Donetsk is likely to go down as one of the defining moments of the conflict.

Many residents have fled, many more have been taken prisoner and some, like Nastya and her parents, remain.

While many residents have fled, Nastya's family remains in Ilovaysk as the fierce battle continues outside
