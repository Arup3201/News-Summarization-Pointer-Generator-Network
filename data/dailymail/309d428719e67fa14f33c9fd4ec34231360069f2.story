A rare appearance on the campaign trail by President Obama on Sunday night was marred by a steady stream of crowd members leaving early and even a yelling heckler.

The president had shown up at the Democratic rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, near Washington, to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running for governor.

With Obama's approval levels hovering around record lows, many candidates from his party have been wary of appearing with the president during their election races because of his sagging popularity.

Roughly 8,000 people packed a high school gymnasium - with more in an overflow crowd next-door - where Obama adopted his party's mantra for this election season by claiming the midterms would come down to one thing: ‘Who is going to fight for you?’

‘The Republican Party can keep telling you what they're against,’ Obama said, riffing off a long list: affordable health care, immigration reform, action on climate change, to name a few. ‘But the good news is Democrats keep telling you what things we're for.’

But no sooner had the president started to speak that a steady stream of people started to make for the exits  and at one point a heckler even interrupted his remarks.

The heckler was a pro-immigration-reform protester holding a handwritten sign reading ‘#Not1More.’

‘The problem is, I’m actually for immigration reform,’ said Obama. ‘Of course, he should be protesting the folks who are blocking it, but that’s OK.’

Also on Sunday, the president returned to the accepting embrace of his home state of Illinois to support Governor Pat Quinn, who is running for re-election.

The president told voters that Republicans mean well, but ‘just have bad ideas.’

He accused the GOP of recycling those ideas over and over, urging voters to take their future into their own hands by electing Democrats on Nov. 4.

‘The power to move our society, our government, it really is in your hands,’ Obama said during the Illinois rally that doubled as a homecoming for the president. 

‘You're the reason that I had the audacity to actually run for president of the United States.’

Echoing many of the same themes as his own 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Obama said Democrats were fighting to give women equal pay, give children a good education and give all Americans access to decent health care.

He contrasted that with the policies of Republicans, whom he claimed were living in the 1950s and belong ‘in a Mad Men episode.’

Obama's rallies Sunday in Chicago and Maryland marked his first major foray into the 2014 midterm elections. 

He was supposed to rally last week in Connecticut for Gov. Dannel Malloy, but postponed that visit to focus on Ebola.

Though limited in his ability to help his party this year, Obama has sought to use his own policies, like a minimum wage hike, to frame an economic message that can lift up Democratic candidates across the country. 

In radio ads and other appearances, Obama has also sought to rev up the same voting blocs that helped elect him twice - including minorities, women and young people - in hopes they'll show up this year even without Obama on the ballot.

'We're in the fight of our lives for the soul of Illinois' democracy. They may have more money,' Quinn said of his opponent, Republican Bruce Rauner. 'But we've got President Barack Obama.'

Obama picked out people from the crowd whom he knew, and seemed to relish being back in Illinois.

‘It's good to be home,’ Obama said. ‘I care about what happens here,’ he said to applause.

Early voting in Illinois starts on Monday for the Nov. 4, election.

The president plans to cast his vote early on Monday and is scheduled to spend the night at his Chicago home.

In the coming weeks he will rally for another half-dozen Democratic candidates for governor, but is not venturing into the conservative-leaning states where Democrats are fighting their toughest Senate races.

Obama's help, or lack thereof, may not matter much to Brown, who is 11 points ahead of Republican opponent Larry Hogan, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics.

Quinn's race is tighter. He is ahead of Republican Bruce Rauner by 1.8 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average.
