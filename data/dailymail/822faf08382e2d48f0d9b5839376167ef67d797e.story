Actress Helen Mirren said the Royals are 'vulnerable, complicated human beings' just like everyone else

Dame Helen Mirren has said the Royal Family live such bizarre lives they are like ‘aliens’.

The actress, who has played the Queen four times, said the Royals’ inhabited a strange world but remained ‘the same flawed, insecure, vulnerable, complicated human beings’ as the rest of us.

The 69-year-old, who earned an Oscar for her 2006 film portrayal of the monarch, told the New York Times: ‘The world they live in is so beyond our understanding.

‘You’ve never queued for anything. Ever, for anything. Every time you go in the street, the traffic is stopped for you. It’s a world you can’t imagine. They are, in a way, aliens.

‘But, inside that, they are the same flawed, insecure, vulnerable, complicated human beings we are. It’s my job to get into the person who’s inside that world.’

Dame Helen, who is reprising her role as the Queen in a Broadway play this weekend, said she was not a monarchist but a ‘queenist’.

She added: ‘I think people misunderstand because she doesn’t smile all the time. But she’s not a movie star, she’s a queen.

‘Smiling is not a requirement. What’s required is to be dignified, to be almost iconic and self-controlled – not to be charming.

‘In the end, I prefer that to someone who smiles a lot and secretly has bulimia.’

Dame Helen first wore the crown as Queen Charlotte in The Madness of King George in 1994, before playing Elizabeth I in a TV series in 2005.

She then took on the role of today’s monarch in the 2006 Stephen Frears film The Queen.

Dame Helen, who was 59 when she made the movie, played Elizabeth II at the time of Princess Diana’s death - who was 71.

In 2007, she turned down an invitation to have tea with the Queen because of filming commitments, but met Her Highness at Ascot the following year.

The event was hosted by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh and included a specially commissioned theatre performance in the Ballroom, inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.

Dame Helen is now reprising her role as the monarch in The Audience, a play which had a sell-out West End run last year and begins in preview on Broadway this weekend.

The play examines the Queen’s relationship with her Prime Ministers during the weekly audiences held every Tuesday at Buckingham Palace throughout her reign, beginning with Sir Winston Churchill.

She transforms from the eager young Queen to the present day ‘grandmother of the nation’, to use a phrase from The Audience’s director Stephen Daldry.
