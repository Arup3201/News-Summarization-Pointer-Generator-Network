CLICK HERE to read the full story of Lewis Hamilton's clash with Nico Rosberg as Daniel Ricciardo wins the Belgian Grand Prix

Mercedes are standing by Lewis Hamilton's extraordinary claim that Nico Rosberg told him that he deliberately crashed into him in Sunday's bitter Belgian Grand Prix.

Sources within the team told Sportsmail that Hamilton's account of the post-race meeting was 'broadly correct'.  

The two Mercedes men clashed on the second lap - Rosberg’s front wing punctured Hamilton’s rear left tyre and ultimately forced the British driver to retire from the race - as the world championship fight broke out into open warfare.

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second.

May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. 

May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. 

Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. 

August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.  

Hamilton, who was visibly emotional after speaking to Rosberg about the incident, claimed: ‘I was gobsmacked when I was in the meeting.

‘He (Nico) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault.’

That last comment referred to the animosity that has been building up between the two men for months. Rosberg was angry that Hamilton cut across him in Bahrain; Hamilton felt Rosberg deliberately scuppered his qualifying lap in Monaco; and, perhaps most importantly, Rosberg was still fuming that Hamilton did not follow a team order at the last race in Hungary.

Hamilton added: ‘When you’re out there you have to trust people not to do things deliberately, but after that meeting I don’t really know how to approach the next race.

‘All I know is I’ve got to push. The support has been great - so many British flags and tops, and I’m gutted I wasn’t able to get a result for them this weekend.’

Rosberg was booed by Hamilton’s supporters on the podium after coming second to Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo. The German now leads the championship by 29 points with seven races remaining.

Rosberg’s management did not respond to Hamilton’s claims directly, saying he prefers to ‘discuss things internally’. However, Rosberg publicly mainatained it was ‘a racing incident’ rather than a deliberate act of malice.

However, his team bosses did not agree on Sunday. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘It is unacceptable that in the second lap Nico hit Lewis, completely unacceptable.

‘If these things happen at the end of the race, when they are fighting for the win then OK, but in the second lap to hand the victory to Red Bull is madness.’
