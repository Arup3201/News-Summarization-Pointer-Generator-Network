Pippa Middleton is allegedly being offered a correspondent's job with NBC following her first ever TV interview, it was revealed today.

The Today show broadcast a teaser on Wednesday live from London where Matt Lauer had flown to sit down with the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister.

The 30-year-old will dish on 'what it's like to be Pippa' in the exclusive interview set to air on Monday and Tuesday.

Sources told the New York Post that NBC has been after an interview with Pippa for a while and is set to offer her a correspondent's role, appearing in special reports.

It is not thought that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits.

In
 2012, it was reported that NBC would offer Pippa, a freelance writer 
and party planner, $600,000 to be a royal correspondent but this was 
denied by the network.

A source told the Post: 'Pippa could do reports based on her party planning book or her charity work.'

Miss Middleton was dropped by her American publisher Viking Press earlier this year after her 
party-planning book Celebrate sold just 18,000 copies.

It
 was announced in May that Pippa had been dropped as a columnist for The
 Daily Telegraph after just six months. She still writes for Vanity Fair
 and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose.

Clarence House refused to comment on the rumors today as Miss Middleton is not a member of the Royal Family. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from NBC but a spokesman told the Post that the rumor was '100 per cent not true'.

Matt Lauer gained a worldwide exclusive with Pippa Middleton. It is the first time Pippa has given a TV interview after her sister became a member of the British Royal Family

The network has a habit of scooping up relatives of the rich and powerful.

Bill
 and Hillary Clinton's daughter Chelsea is currently being paid $600,000
 a year to do a smattering of reports for NBC News, it was revealed in a
 report last week. 

Clinton was still being paid $50,000 a month by NBC despite the fact that she hasn't been featured since January.

Jenna
 Bush Hager, daughter of former president George W, was hired by NBC in 2009 as a correspondent when she was a 27-year-old teacher. It is not clear how
 much the fellow first daughter makes as part of her contract.

Pippa appeared briefly on camera with Lauer on Wednesday as the pair had just finished taping the interview.

Lauer joked that he had to catch an overnight flight to London for his hour-long chat with Pippa, to which she responded: 'I hate to say it but I was actually in America last week.'

She giggled at Lauer's feigned protests, adding: 'Sorry.'

The pair chatted over a cup of tea at an outdoor table in a sunny London garden.

Miss Middleton, looking tanned in a low-cut white shirt with jeans and tasteful gold jewellery, said very little during the minute-long clip except to add: 'I was on my bike.'

The party-planner, who looked immaculate with pared down make-up and a glossy blow-dry, recently completed a marathon, 3,000 mile cycle across the U.S. with her brother James.

Pippa joked with Lauer as they drank tea during the exclusive TV interview which is due to be aired on Monday and Tuesday next week

The siblings and five other men had 
set off from California last week on the Race Across America with the 
aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity.

They
 cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, 
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa, 30, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Asked if she had suffered saddle sores, she laughed and said: 'It wasn't too bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly comfy saddle.'

Challenges don't stop there for the Celebrate author - she is soon to be on her way to Istanbul to take on the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Race, a 6.5km historical swim that crosses from Europe to Asia.
