Jonathan Davies is determined to prove Wales’ doubters wrong in the final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations and plans to celebrate the championship with a plastic cup after a silverware snub.

With trophies being sent to Twickenham and Murrayfield, Wales will return home from Rome empty handed even if they go on to win the three-horse race for the title.

Warren Gatland’s side need a thumping victory over Italy to overturn their points deficit on England and Ireland and — despite the Kiwi keeping his counsel about the scenario — there is understood to be some disappointment about the organisers’ trophy decision.

‘I’m sure we’ll find a trophy somewhere, like a plastic cup or something,’ said Davies.

‘Obviously people are doubting us and they don’t think we’re going to be involved. But we just worry about ourselves, concentrate on ourselves, and will put a performance together that hopefully means we can get the cup on Sunday.’

Welsh hopes of a landslide victory could hinge on the fitness of Italy No 8 Sergio Parisse, who has a ‘30-40 per cent chance’ of being fit.

Italy have delayed their team announcement by 24 hours to give him time to recover, but Davies says Wales will not change their approach even if the 31-year-old is ruled out.

Scott Williams is congratulated by Davies and Dan Biggar following his crucial try against Ireland  

‘We can’t fall into that trap,’ said Davies. ‘If you do, the pressure seems to come on you rather than the opposition.

‘Italy have some key injuries with the captain maybe being out, and after the disappointment of France, they’ll have doubt in their minds.

‘It’s about us going out there and stamping our authority. It’s about sealing that doubt and building from there.’

While Italy are struggling for form, Wales are still building momentum after their victory over Ireland.

A fine defensive display kept the championship race alive, however Davies knows his side must add more cutting edge in attack.

Warren Gatland's side are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title that will be decided on Saturday 

‘Looking back on the Ireland game, we probably left two or three scoring opportunities out there,’ said Davies. ‘This week we’re going to have to take all our chances.

‘As a back line we haven’t fired as we’d have wanted to. The forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there’s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities.’

If Wales can rack up the points, the pressure will move on to Ireland and England, who are up second and third against Scotland and France in the afternoon of staggered fixtures.

Davies and his countrymen will watch events unfold from Rome and he plans to cheer on his French clubmates from Clermont Auvergne.

Italy's captain and talisman Sergio Parisse faces a race to fit for the visit of Wales on Saturday 

‘France can be amazing at times,’ said Davies. ‘Hopefully, they can turn up and do a job. They’ve done it in the past.’

Aside from two injury-enforced changes in the front row, Gatland has kept faith with the starting XV who beat Ireland. Scott Williams scored the decisive try and the centre was on Wednesday among the latest batch of players — along with Alun-Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate and Gareth Anscombe — to sign a dual contract with the WRU and their region.

‘Alun-Wyn, Dan, Scott and Gareth represent a cross-section of experience. Each one of them is a player of proven talent,’ said Gatland.
