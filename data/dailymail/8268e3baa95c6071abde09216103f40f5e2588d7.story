The RSPCA should stop attempting to bring criminal prosecutions against hunts, an independent inquiry found yesterday.

The charity should also rethink its longstanding role of taking animal cruelty cases to court, and help develop a new system in which it would work with Government agencies to bring offenders to book.

The inquiry led by former Crown Prosecution Service chief inspector Stephen Wooler followed criticism of the RSPCA over its successful prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt for breaking hunting law by using hounds to chase foxes in 2012.

The charity was accused of a political vendetta against the hunt – which once numbered David Cameron among its riders – and the magistrate in charge of the case called the £327,000 prosecution costs run up by the RSPCA ‘staggering’. Fines and costs levied against the hunt came to less than £30,000.

Mr Wooler said the charity had over its 190-year history come to act as a private police force pursuing those suspected of animal cruelty.

‘The current role of the RSPCA has evolved largely outside the mainstream criminal justice system and owes more to history than any strategy,’ he said.

‘The unstructured and haphazard environment within which the RSPCA operates now means that the RSPCA role is poorly defined and its relationships with the public bodies with whom its work overlaps are unclear.’

He added that the charity has substantial public support but ‘there are significant weaknesses. In particular, its prosecution role has failed to develop to accord with contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability. It therefore needs to adapt.’

The report recommended that prosecutions under hunting law should be the province of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, and the charity should act only as a last resort if state organisations fail to act. Cruelty prosecutions should be pared back to avoid clashing with the RSPCA’s campaigning objectives.

On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting.

‘The evidence reviewed leaves no room for doubt that, despite the 2004 legislation, traditional fox hunting remains “business as usual” in many parts of the country. 

'Extensive flouting of the law risks bringing Parliament, the police and prosecuting authorities into disrepute. Widely publicised criticism of the RSPCA over the costs of the Heythrop Hunt case undoubtedly caused it reputational damage even though the prosecution itself was fully justified,’ it found.

The report, which runs to 140 pages and contains a string of recommendations for re-organisation the the charity’s prosecution arm, said the RSPCA must develop an open system of co-operation with state investigators and prosecutors. ‘Without such change, the Society will be vulnerable to those with a very narrow agenda that is not founded on legitimate concern,’ he said.

RSPCA chairman Mike Tomlinson said: ‘The RSPCA recognises that the world has dramatically changed during the 190 years that we have been investigating animal welfare complaints and helping to enforce the country’s animal welfare laws.

Ruling: On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting. Above, Heythrop Huntsmen and hounds, pictured in 2008 

‘We accept the need to re-position the RSPCA’s long-standing enforcement role and will now consider these recommendations in detail. We are determined to ensure that we operate an enforcement process fit for the 21st century. The public and the animals deserve no less.’

He added: ‘Hunting prosecutions are a tiny part of the RSPCA’s enforcement work but this review provides an ideal opportunity to look at the way we handle such cases and to make any necessary adjustments. 

'Significantly, the review found that the RSPCA’s prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt had been appropriately brought and was not politically motivated. We accept the criticism that the costs of that case were much too high and have implemented lessons learned in subsequent cases.’
