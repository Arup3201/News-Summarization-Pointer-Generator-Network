Chelsea's funds from the projected sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United are being earmarked for a striker.

United have Edinson Cavani and Diego Costa in their sights but have been made aware that Chelsea are keen on Costa in particular while Radamel Falcao at Monaco is also still on the Stamford Bridge club's list.

Jose Mourinho has watched Costa personally in recent months and his interest could be aided by the fact that he shares the same agent, with the prolific 25-year-old striker signed up to Jorge Mendes. A sale in January does look difficult though.

Another player United and Chelsea have had scouted recently is Juventus striker Domenico Berardi.

The 19-year-old is on loan from Juventus at Sassuolo and grabbed headlines when he scored all four goals in the 4-3 win over AC Milan. It made him the first teenager since Silvio Piola in 1931 to score a hat-trick in Italy and the first player to score four goals against Milan in a single match.

Chelsea's interest in Wayne Rooney is unlikely to bear fruit and rumblings at United are that the England forward is even leaning towards a change of heart about his future at Old Trafford - although there is still work to be done.

The purchase of Mata would help lift most at the club, not least goalkeeper David de Gea, with talk in Spain that their big clubs are considering a summer approach for United's No 1.

Presence: Atletico Madrid would like to make Thibault Courtois' loan deal from Chelsea permanent

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, has said he is desperate to sign on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Asked if he would pay £23m for Courtois, Simeone replied: 'Definitely. For me, any price for Courtois would be cheap. He is a young guy who has a huge future ahead of him and is on course to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.'

AC Milan are showing an interest in Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.

The 27-year-old Dane with the famous father is continuing to impress and Leicester are wary of a big offer from Italy after scouts watched recent games. Manager Nigel Pearson has earmarked Wayne Hennessey as a potential replacement should Clarence Seedorf follow up with a bid.

Milan had been keen on Newcastle's Tim Krul but he would cost around £15million.

Leicester's Championship form has also attrcated offers from Fulham for defender Liam Moore and team-mate Jeffrey Schlupp.

West Ham have shown an interest in AC Milan midfielder Antonio Nocerino in a move that could accelerate Michael Essien's departure to Italy from Chelsea.

Manager Sam Allardyce is looking for a new midfielder with either Ravel Morrison or Mohamed Diame expected to join Fulham before the end of the month. Nocerino is available on loan even though he is an Italy international and played against England in Euro 2012. The 28-year-old has also been offered to West Bromwich Albion.

Essien is hoping to be in Milan by the weekend with Clarence Seedorf assessing his new but ailing squad. The Ghana midfielder would be viewed as a ready-made replacement for Nocerino but, in terms of sharpness, West Ham would be getting the better deal.

The Hammers are also among clubs to have been offered Marco Borriello from Roma.

Former Manchester City midfielder Nigel de Jong is among those considered to be unhappy at the San Siro and that has prompted talk at Liverpool of a loan move with Brendan Rodgers mindful that Lucas Leiva will miss two months with his knee injury.

Anfield head of recruitment Dave Fallows knows De Jong well from his time at City but the Reds are considering sticking with the midfield players they have instead.

Liverpool are continuing negotiations with FC Basle over Mohamed Salah but face fierce competition with rival suitors making bigger offers. Atletico Madrid, Zenit St Petersburg and Bayer Leverkusen remain in the hunt but the player would prefer Merseyside if a price can be agreed.

Resurrection: Valencia midfielder Sergio Canales could move to Everton to revive his career

Sergio Canales, the one time golden 
boy of Spanish football, is looking for a loan move to England with 
Everton among those clubs interested.

The
 22-year-old Valencia midfielder was hot property as a teenager at 
Racing Santander when he was courted by European giants such as Manchester United, Chelsea, 
Arsenal and Real Madrid.

He took the decision to stay in Spain and 
joined Madrid to a huge fanfare.

He was loaned out to Valencia in 2011 but his 
career stalled after two cruciate injuries. He did, however, make a permanent move to the Mestalla.

Now
 he is fit and looking to get his career back on track. Real Sociedad 
are keen to keep him in La Liga but he is interested in the Premier League.

Everton
 will be wary on taking risks though. They are awaiting further tests on
 Lacina Traore's hamstring injury before ratifying his loan move from 
Monaco.

Everton's prime objective is to make sure they have cover for 
Romelu Lukaku when they face Chelsea on February 22 as the Belgian - who is the Toffees' main centre forward - is 
not allowed to face his parent club.

The saga over Leeds United's takeover continues to twist and turn with Brian McDermott struggling to bring in new players and get his promotion push back on track.

The interest of Cagliari president Massimo Cellino has prompted questions of whether the club will follow Watford's pattern and trigger a flow of Italian players to Elland Road should he put a successful bid in place.

Sport Capital's proposed deal has stalled with the consortium and Gulf Finance House wrangling yesterday over completion of that takeover.

It has affected player purchases as it has emerged that officials at the Bahraini bank blocked an attempt by Leeds to sign striker Ashley Barnes. He opted to join Burnley from Brighton despite Sport Capital’s members, among them Enterprise Insurance managing director Andrew Flowers, making funds available for a £500,000 transfer fee.

Struggle: Brian McDermott is finding it difficult to bring players in and get Leeds' promotion push back on track

Leeds are considering a move for Swansea striker Leroy Lita but are on a five-game losing streak, which has seen them drop to 12th in the Championship. They played a behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley on Tuesday and won 3-0 with El-Hadji Diouf, who is free to leave, Matt Smith, and Luke Murphy scoring.

Cagliari owner Cellino has not denied his interest in Leeds, however, he says he also used a visit to London to ask about Julio Cesar at QPR. The Brazil goalkeeper is also wanted by Sampdoria but his wages are a problem.

Queens Park Rangers will be looking to kickstart talks over the transfer of Inter Milan's Ishak Belfodil later on Wednesday.

Co-owners Parma have finally given the go-ahead for the transfer and the Algeria striker is ready to join on loan with the prospect of a permanent deal in the summer a possibility should all go well and QPR earn promotion.

The 22-year-old, who is 6ft 3in tall, is keen to play more regularly to cement his place in Algeria's World Cup squad and go to the tournament sharp and in form.

Parma's deliberations had threatened the deal with QPR looking elsewhere.

Celtic manager Neil Lennon was among the crowd watching Charlton's FA Cup tie at Oxford United on Tuesday. The Celtic boss is in the market for a striker and a defender with Charlton's Michael Morrison one he has been linked to in the past. Yann Kermorgant scored two goals for Charlton in the 3-0 win.

Manchester City have released midfielder Abdisalam Ibrahim, 22, and are facing competition from Manchester United and Liverpool for 14-year-old Tom Dele-Bashiru who has impressed in their academy.
