Super Saturday certainly lived up to its name as the final three games of the RBS 6 Nations served up a veritable try-fest in Rome, Edinburgh and London.

Wales and England’s efforts proved in vain as Ireland claimed their second title in succession thanks to their 30-point drubbing of Scotland in Murrayfield.

Following a frantic finale, Sportsmail’s Rory Keane points out six things we learned from this year’s championship.

Attitude is everything

After four rounds of claustrophobic, defence-orientated rugby – the floodgates opened up on the final day of the 2015 RBS 6 Nations.

Plenty has been said in recent weeks about the state of the modern game. Kick-chasing, rush defences and negative tactics have led to some turgid contests in this season’s tournament.

Tries and big points totals were the order of the day on Saturday, however, and what a difference it made to all three contests as Wales, Ireland and England threw everything into their late title bids.

Running rugby, offloads and daring play were on display across Europe as Ireland did enough to claim the trophy.

The game doesn’t need to change; it’s just a question of mindset.

England have the firepower to match anyone on their day 

England relied on their forward power to dig themselves out of a hole against Wales in the opening round, but it was the backs who rescued the contest against France…and almost secured the championship.

In a frantic game of rugby played at breakneck speed - the likes of Ben Youngs, Jonathan Joseph and Jack Nowell tore the French defence to shreds. George Ford, aged just 22, looks the real deal at fly half and is developing a world class half back pairing with Youngs. All Ford needs now is a foil at inside centre to add width and a kicking option to England’s attack. Exeter Chiefs playmaker Henry Slade could very well be the answer to that conundrum.

Stuart Lancaster’s side are by no means the finished article but if they can fuse their monstrous pack, efficient set-piece and exciting wide men together, they could be serious contenders for the William Webb Ellis trophy.

France remain an enigma locked in a riddle

Phillipe Saint-Andre has overseen another disappointing tournament for Les Bleus, but his side showed at Twickenham that they can certainly play when the mood takes them.

Following four rounds of stuttering attacking play, Scott Spedding, Maxime Mermoz and Noa Nakaitaci ran amok at Twickenham. Sweeping backline moves, offloads and counter-attacking ballast; where was this French team hiding? A special mention for monstrous loosehead prop Vincent Debaty who tracked Nakaitaci’s weaving run to touch down in the left corner. It summed up France’s attitude on the day.

Interestingly, France arrived in London boasting the meanest defence in the tournament only to then leak a flurry of tries.

France remain an enigma, but one thing is certain, Saint-Andre has plenty of work to do if his side are to make any impression when they return to England for the big one in September.

The Green Machine will be hard to stop

Ireland bounced back from their setback against Wales with a powerful performance against the Scots. Joe Schmidt’s side went back to basics with their intelligent kicking game complemented by a strong set-piece and canny power plays. 

But Ireland also showed thay can attack with ball in hand and expanded their game to allow the attacking talents of Robbie Henshaw, Jared Payne and Tommy Bowe to flourish in the wide open spaces of Murrayfield.

Ireland will have their detractors but back-to-back Six Nations titles speak for themselves. If Schmidt’s side can add some extra guile to their attacking game in the coming months, they will be serious contenders for the forthcoming World Cup.

No 3 is the No 1 issue for Wales

Wales finished the tournament like a runaway train but Warren Gatland will have nightmares about the mincing his side’s scrum took against Ireland and Italy.

The Welsh have some of the most devastating strike runners in the game in the form of George North, Jonathan Davies and Jamie Roberts while Sam Warburton had one of his best tournaments to date.

Having all that talent out wide counts for nothing, however, if a solid platform is missing. Samson Lee’s long-term injury at tighthead has created a huge void for Gatland. Veteran Adam Jones insists his Test days are over but, if Gatland wants Wales to mount a serious challenge at the World Cup, he may have to swallow his pride and give Jones a call.

Rome has fallen

Saturday’s contest in Rome served up yet another final day capitulation from the Azzurri. This is becoming quite the habit for the tournament whipping boys. Wales were impressive but some of the Italian defence was laughable at times.

There is no question that Italy’s presence has benefited the tournament greatly, but big improvements are needed going forward.

Sergio Parisse is unquestionably world class but the Stade Francais No 8 has been carrying the burden of a nation for long enough. There are some grounds for optimism for Italy though with the likes of Luca Morisi and Leonardo Sarto showing glimpses of attacking potential throughout the tournament.
