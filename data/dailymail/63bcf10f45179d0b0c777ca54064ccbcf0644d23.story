Captured: A prison picture of Simon Hennessey, who was held by detectives in Australia after spending 15 years on the run

A British fugitive who escaped from prison after stabbing his aunt 70 times in a frenzied murder has been recaptured after 15 years on the run.

Simon Hennessey, who was 14 when he was convicted of killing his elderly relative in a brutal knife attack, was arrested by Australian detectives investigating a credit card scam in Queensland.

Hennessey, 49, was arrested in April and initially charged with 50 counts of fraud under a false name, authorities unaware that they were dealing with the wanted killer.

He originally claimed to be from New Zealand and according to Australian media appeared in local courts several times under that identity before police realised he was not who he purported to be.

A spokeswoman for Queensland Police said he had been arrested earlier this month in the Sunshine Coast town of Maroochydore.

He appeared before Maroochydore Magistrates' Court on June 17 and is currently in custody pending his next hearing in July.

'There is not much more we can say because of the court situation but we are aware that he is a wanted criminal in the UK,' she said.

Hennessey's arrest is understood to be related to a sophisticated credit card scam running to tens of thousands of Australian dollars.He could face a lengthy prison sentence if convicted in an Australian court, but Avon and Somerset police have already contacted the authorities in Australia to discuss his extradition .

He escaped from the Leyhill Open Prison in Gloucestershire in 1998, just three days after being transferred from the secure mental unit where he had served 20 years of a life sentence for manslaughter.

Originally from Plymouth, Hennessey had pleaded guilty to killing 72-year-old Mary Webber at his 1978 trial on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Detectives said they believed he had travelled between Thailand, New Zealand and Queensland during his years on the run, using a series of stolen identities and false passports.

'He had not been seen or heard of until he was picked up at Tewantin," Sunshine Coast CIB chief Daren Edwards was quoted as saying by the Sunshine Coast Daily.

'We knew there was more to him and it appears he has used several identities.

'We believe he has moved between Thailand, New Zealand and Australia.

'It looks like he has been coming and going from Australia since about 2003.'

Hennessey is currently in custody in Queensland and faces his next court hearing on July 15. If found guilty of the fraud charges he could be jailed in Australia, or be extradited back to the United Kingdom.

Avon and Somerset police said they had been in touch with the Queensland authorities and hoped to begin extradition proceedings.
