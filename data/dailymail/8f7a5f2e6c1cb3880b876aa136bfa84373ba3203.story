Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students

A high school teacher whose baby is fathered by one of her 16-year-old students pleaded guilty to six sex charges in court today.

Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, had been
charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor in 
alleged crimes that took place in Redlands, Los Angeles.

Whitehurst admitted having sex with three of her students despite initially pleading not guilty to all charges.

She pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and two counts of oral copulation with a minor.

The remaining charges were dismissed during a hearing at San Bernardino Superior Court on Wednesday morning, NBC reports.

She agreed to a sentence of one year in jail, five years of probation and a lifetime registration as a sex offender and sex offender counseling.

Whitehurst was arrested earlier this month after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police.

The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school.

Her attorney, James Gass, told news media outside the courtroom yesterday that Whitehurst wanted to retain custody of her baby girl, whom he confirmed had been fathered by the victim.

When she was first arrested he told reporters she was just a 'clean-cut American girl' and was having a hard time being in jail - which is evident from her recent court pictures.

After that, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst.

Sex offender: Laura Whitehurst, a Redlands teacher who had an affair and a baby with a 16-year-old student, pleaded guilty to six sex counts today

Punishment: She agreed to a sentence of one year in jail, five years of probation and a lifetime registration as a sex offender and sex offender counseling

Admission: Whitehurst was arrested earlier this month after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police

She told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012.

Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship.

'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated.

The latest victim to come forward said 
he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English 
teacher at Redlands High School.

The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as
22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about
their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of 
kissing him during a school field trip.

'I didn't have anything to say 
really,' he said. 'I was like, "Oh really, that's crazy," and a couple 
of days later, we ended up actually kissing.'

He
said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and 
he spent the night.

They 
continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as 
if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they
both knew what was going to happen, he said.

'When
it happens, you're kind of like, 
all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is 
into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was.

'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not 
scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a 
good time when it was going on.'

'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home

But
in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and
calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They 
eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said.

He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship.

Cooper
has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to 
press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to 
encourage other victims to come forward.

Whitehurst said that they had a 
relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha
Crawford said during a phone interview.

According to the Redlands Police 
Department, Whitehurst's underage lover - with whom she had a child - was 16-years-old during their 
year-long relationship, which allegedly started last summer.

The
mother of the alleged victim, who is now 17, became 
aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the 
Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police.Â 

Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father.

The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser.

In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

The news blog PE.com reported that Whitehurst's father, Dale Whitehurst, has served as principal of Brywn Mawr Elementary and Moore Middle schools in Redlands.

He also worked as assistant principal at Redlands Easy Valley high School.
