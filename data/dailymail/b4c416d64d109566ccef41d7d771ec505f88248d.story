The National Football League has enacted stiffer punishments for any personnel who commit domestic violence.

In a letter to team owners, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said players, coaches and owners now face a six-game suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban for a second.

Goodell said second-time offenders may petition for reinstatement after a year, but with no guarantees.

Harsher penalties could also be levied for offenders with incidents before joining the NFL or 'violence involving a weapon, choking, repeated striking, or when the act is committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child,' the letter states.

The NFL has been criticized for its inconsistent and often lax penalties for off-field offenses.

Ravens
 running back Ray Rice, for example, had to sit out just two games for hitting his now-wife Janay in an Atlantic City casino. 

In contrast, Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon had to stay out of the 2014 season and was banned for a full year for testing positive for marijuana.

Critics
 of the NFL's arbitrary policy toward domestic violence point to the 
contrast between the punishments and say it's time for the league to 
crack down on players who hurt women.

Three members of Congress wrote
Goodell asking him to reconsider Rice's 
suspension, the governor of Maine says he'll boycott the league, and 
numerous groups that advocate for women and families condemned the 
penalty as too lenient.

In his letter, the commissioner admitted that he 'didn't get it right.'

'We allowed our standards to fall below where they should be and lost an important opportunity to emphasize our strong stance on a critical issue and the effective programs we have in place,' Goodell wrote.

'My disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families. I take responsibility both for the decision and for ensuring that our actions in the future properly reflect our values.'

The NFL Players Association said the union was informed of the new policies but didn't have to approve it, as it's a change in personal conduct policy, a source told USA Today Sports. 

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon (12) was banned from the league for a year for testing positive for marijuana. Critics pointed to his harsher punishment, compared to Rice's two-game suspension, as a sign of NFL's lenient and inconsistent treatment of domestic violence offenses
