Dentist Chris Siddons has fitted plenty of dentures in his time - but never to a goose.

Bird Tilly - who was given a girl's name by his owners who originally thought he was female - lost half his beak when he was just six months old after accidentally chomping on barbed wire.

The seven-year-old goose had been using his tongue to replace the missing part of the beak following the accident.

But after Tilly's beak began to deteriorate, Mr Siddons, from Burley, North Yorkshire, stepped in and used his dental skills to patch it up crafting a prosthetic beak out of materials normally used for false teeth.

Tilly's owner Frances Hall-Coetzer from Gargrave, North Yorkshire, who says she has a special bond with her bird, sought help when Tilly's tongue became sore and more of his beak started falling away.

She was initially told her beloved goose would probably have to be put down so she sought a second opinion with local vet Andy MacGregor, from Ashlands Vets in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.

Mr MacGregor created a temporary fix for Tilly using dental resin and orthopaedic screws which allowed him to start eating and drinking normally.

He then called his dentist friend Chris Siddons of The Burley Dental Suite, in nearby Wharfedale.

He put Tilly under general anesthetic and took some silicone impressions of his beak using dental materials.

A technician was able to cast the impressions to produce a study model which was used as a template to make the new beak.

Mr Siddons used a material called cold cured dental acrylic, which is the same substance used for creating human dentures.

The dental practitioner said it was the first time he had treated a goose in his 20 years in the job.

He said: 'The vet is a very good friend of mine, and when I got the phone call I thought it was a joke to start with.

'I've helped before dealing with root fillings for dogs, but this is the first time ever I have operated on a goose.

'This sort of operation is fairly rare and it's quite rare for the animal to survive.'

Fitting the beak took around an hour.

Anne MacGregor, practice manager at the vets, told how the procedure should have cost £100 but was done for free as the surgery had never seen anything like Tilly’s condition before.

She said: 'Tilly came in with his beak hanging apart. He was managing to eat and maintain his weight by using his tongue, but it was dried out due to overusing it.

'It took just 45 minutes to fix on Tilly’s new beak and we’re looking to send him home for the future soon. This is a very rare operation and something which I don’t think we’ll ever see in this vets again.

'Everyone has done a fantastic job and thankfully Tilly is doing really well now.'

Mrs Hall-Coetzer  said: 'When he was six months old, I took him to a farm but he suffered an accident whilst he was there.

'I took him to the vets near to where I live, but they said they couldn't do anything about it.

'He had bitten on some barbed wire, and as time had gone by more of his beak had been pulled away and he used his tongue to compensate that.

'His tongue became quite sore and hard so three weeks ago I took him to Ashland's, who said they may be able to help.'

She added: 'Tilly is really special and incredibly tame, I just thought I had to to what I could.

'It's amazing how he's managed to survive seven years with this, but after I spotted his tongue dropping, I knew something drastic had to be done.

'Without the vets at Ashland's, Tilly wouldn't be alive now and I'm so grateful for what they have done.

'I don't have any children and he is my life, we have a special bond and I'm so glad he's been saved.'
