Fake coins totalling more than £4million have been discovered in a freight container.

Scotland Yard believes the haul is the biggest of its kind recorded in the UK.

In total £4.1million worth of counterfeit coins were seized on Wednesday during raids in Enfield, north London, Hertfordshire and Essex.

Haul: Fake coins totalling more than £4 million have been discovered in a freight container

An estimated £4million worth of blank coins - ready to be turned into £1 coins - were discovered within a 40ft freight container

A further £107,000 in already-pressed counterfeit coins was seized.

Detectives said it was a 'significant blow' to the crime gang behind the scam.

But officers said they believe some of the money produced by the gang may already be in circulation.

Three men, aged 52, 43 and 27, were arrested and are being held at a north London police station.

The three properties where the money was recovered are believed to be storage locations.

Officers have yet to identify where the coins were pressed.

Detective Inspector Bruce South, Projects Team, said: 'This seizure is a significant blow to the network behind it; individuals clearly intent on undermining the UK monetary system by producing counterfeit currency on an industrial scale.

'It is yet another example of the work this team is carrying out on a daily basis to tackle organised criminal networks.'
