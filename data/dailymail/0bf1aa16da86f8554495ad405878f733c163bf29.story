Andre Johnson and college team-mate Frank Gore moved to Indianapolis to win a Super Bowl.

After being released by the Texans, the 33-year-old wide receiver was left to ponder his next move.

But both he and Gore - who left the 49ers - were settled on the same landing spot.

'After I got released by the Texans, Frank called me,' Johnson told NBC Sports. 'He called me right after it happened and was just like, "What are you gonna do?" I’m like, "Frank, I don’t know. I just got released. I don’t know." 

'I asked, him "Who do you think has the best chance to win a Super Bowl?" And he was like, "Indy." And I was like, "That’s my same choice too so let’s do it, let’s go for it." And they were able to get both of us here.'

Andre Johnson leaves the Texans after 12 seasons with the franchise and has his sights set on a Super Bowl

The rampaging Frank Gore gives Indianapolis a bulldozing, reliable running back

According to ESPN, Johnson's deal is worth $21million over three years.

Drafted third overall in 2003, Johnson goes down as the greatest player in the expansion franchise's history.

He caught 1,012 passes on 1,599 targets for 13,597 yards and averages 6.0 receptions per game, an NFL record.

And for the first time in his career, the seven-time Pro Bowler has the chance to play with a quarterback of elite quality in Andrew Luck.

'That was a very big part of it, wanting to be in a place with a stable quarterback,' he said. 'Andrew is arguably the best quarterback in the game.'

After reaching the AFC Championship last time out, the addition of former Miami Hurricanes team-mate Gore gives Indianapolis the chance to bookend the Trent Richardson experiment.

At 31, Gore is past his prime, but adds a bulldozing element to the backfield after signing a three-year, $12m deal.
