Just when England thought it was safe to dip their toes back in the choppy Australian waters, up popped Mitchell Johnson to swamp hopes of registering any sort of victory against the old enemy before the World Cup.

It was almost as if England had never been away as, in Johnson’s first game of the year, he took them back 12 months to their Ashes misery with a sensational, match-winning display of extreme fast bowling.

The man who did most to ensure England were thrashed 5-0 last winter now put their World Cup hopes into perspective by bursting through the middle order to give Australia victory for the third time already on this tour.

It gave Australia the Tri-series title at the WACA and a huge psychological advantage ahead of their big date in Melbourne on Valentine’s Day when they open this year’s World Cup.

It should be pointed out that Johnson’s devastating burst of three wickets in 10 balls on Sunday — to virtually end England’s hopes of chasing 278 for eight — all came against batsmen who did not play in the Ashes.

1. England are getting better. Yes, don’t laugh, they really are. They don’t need to be as good as World Cup hot-favourites Australia to exceed expectations here and don’t need to peak for at least a month yet.

2. They know their best side, with Ian Bell and Steven Finn cementing their places. It would be a surprise if James Tredwell, Gary Ballance, Alex Hales and Chris Jordan are anything other than subs — but Ravi Bopara could do with a score soon.

3. Moeen Ali can now be considered a front-line spinner in one-day as well as Test cricket. He may not have fully fired as opener but he can be relied on for 10 economical overs.

4. The captain needs runs. Where have we heard that before? Eoin Morgan’s two golden ducks against Australia are worrying. If England are going to fire in the World Cup he must be at his best.

5. The defending champions won’t win it. India, who have been here for nearly three winless months, have been woeful and uninterested in this tournament.

He was meant to be rusty, easing his way back after a month’s absence. In fact, he was simply too quick and too good for James Taylor, Moeen Ali and, first ball, captain Eoin Morgan, in a first spell of four highly significant overs. It must be said the first of those victims looked unlucky, with TV umpire John Ward seemingly failing to spot that Johnson had marginally overstepped, even though the on-field officials had asked him to check for a no-ball.

Once Moeen failed to get out of the way of a brutal snorter and Morgan inexplicably left his first delivery, normal service from the worst tour in England’s history had soberingly resumed.

‘I’m finding it hard to put my finger on why we batted like that,’ said Morgan. ‘At no time were we put under pressure. We made bad decisions which is disappointing. If we play near our capability we will beat them, I’ve no doubt.’

But, surely the Johnson factor was crucial? Not so, says Morgan. ‘He wasn’t at the front of our thoughts. We talked about the opposition but I don’t think we were threatened. I don’t think he swung it. It could have been anybody bowling. We just had a really bad day.’

If England are really not concerned about Johnson they should be, according to Glenn Maxwell, who, if anything, surpassed the fast bowler in scoring 95 and taking four wickets. ‘They should be worried about him,’ said Maxwell. ‘He tore through them. They can be not worried if they like but if they’re getting skittled by him they probably should be.’

This 112-run defeat should not be seen as fatal for England’s World Cup hopes because the structure of one-day cricket’s premier tournament is heavily weighted towards Test teams. But the manner of it was poor.

They reduced Australia to 60 for four but hopes were initially dashed by a stand of 141 between Maxwell and Mitch Marsh and then another blast from the past from James Faulkner.

Faulkner later walked off with a side injury that could rule him out of the World Cup, after smashing 50 from 24 balls. Even so, Australia barely reached par.

Stuart Broad took a big step towards returning to his best with three wickets and Moeen was once again excellent — but this was a nightmare day for Chris Woakes, who went wicketless and conceded a thumping 89 runs to record the fourth-worst figures in England one-day international history. When Woakes was dismissed first ball by the spin of Maxwell his progress had been considerably dented.

England’s hopes of registering what would have been a big victory did not look great when the form man Ian Bell edged Josh Hazlewood to Brad Haddin.

Then Johnson showed there has been no lessening of his powers in the last year, at least on the home pitch that suits him perfectly.

What was less excusable for England was conceding four wickets to Maxwell, who excelled with ball as well as bat as Australia wrapped things up with 65 balls to spare.

England have a week off before warm-up games against Pakistan and West Indies ahead of their reunion with Australia at the MCG.

Johnson will be waiting there even though Morgan was bullish. ‘The pressure will build on them as the home team in a World Cup playing against a dangerous side. We’ll go out with all guns blazing.’

It remains to be seen whether that will be enough against what looks like a formidable Australian one-day side.
