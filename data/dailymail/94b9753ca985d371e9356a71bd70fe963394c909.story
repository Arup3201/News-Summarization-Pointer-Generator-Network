Three boy racers have been jailed for causing a head-on collision while driving in a high-speed convoy of around 30 cars.  

They were part of a gang that was seen racing around roundabouts before speeding into oncoming traffic on a busy stretch of the A40 in Pembrokeshire.

Their 'lunatic' driving was slammed by a judge, who said: 'Cars are not toys for little boys they are dangerous objects', adding that their actions put a 'large number' of road users in danger.

Dangerous: Beavis, who was driving the car pictured, was air-lifted to hospital after the crash. Mother Andrea Gainfort, who was driving the car he hit, was hospitalised for 13 days after the incident

One 21-year-old driver, Scott Beavis, crashed head-on into a car at 80mph after losing control of his vehicle. He was jailed for six months and banned from driving for two years. 

Another driver, Ian Lloyd, 22, received a six-month jail sentence and a two-year driving ban. And Jack Murdoch, 18, was jailed for 16 weeks and banned from driving for 12 months.  

Four other drivers, who were also part of the convey, narrowly escaped jail at Swansea Crown Court today, according to Wales Online.

Judge Paul Thomas criticised their actions, describing them as 'childish, immature and astonishingly bad'. 

The seven defendants met at a garage in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in August 2013, before  driving in a convoy of around 30 cars towards Swansea on the A40. 

Judge Thomas said that the time of year meant that the road would have been heavily congested, adding that a 'large number' of others, including children, were put in danger.

Convoy: Ieuan Power, 18, pictured in the red car above, was among the defendants who appeared in court. He was seen racing around a roundabout shortly after setting off with the convoy, the court was told

Two of the men, Stephen Murray, 23, of  Neyland, Pembrokeshire, and Ieuan Power, 18, of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire raced around a roundabout shortly after setting off, said prosecutor Robin Rouch. 

When the drivers reached a section of the road that split into two lanes, they began using the oncoming lane as an additional overtaking lane. 

A third driver, Scott Beavis, of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, could not control his car and swerved into the oncoming lane, colliding with an oncoming car at 80mph. 

The driver, Andrea Gainfort, suffered a punctured lung and was hospitalised for 13 days. Her daughter and mother, who were travelling in the car with her, were also injured. 

Sentence: Stephen Murray, 23, left, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire, and Ieuan Power, from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, were both given a 12-week suspended jail sentence  and banned from driving for 12 months

Beavis had to be airlifted to Swansea's Morriston Hospital.

Judge Thomas said that Lloyd, of  Neyland, Pembrokeshire,  had set the pace up the A40 and that the others had followed. 

Jack Murdoch, 18, of Waterson, Pembrokeshire, was jailed for 16 weeks and banned from driving for 12 months. 

Stephen Rees, representing Lloyd, said 30 cars left a car park in Haverfordwest as a 'cruise' but not a race.

Admission: James Adams, 23, left, received a 12-week suspended jail sentence and was banned from driving for a year while 19-year-old Edward Adams, right, was ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work

Lloyd and Murdoch both denied dangerous driving but were convicted. The five other defendants admitted dangerous driving.

Power was given a 12 week jail term suspended for a year with 150 hours unpaid work and a year's driving ban.

Murray was also given a 12 week jail sentence suspended for a year with 150 hours unpaid work and a 12 month driving ban.

Edward Adams, 19, of Steynton, Pembrokeshire, was jailed for 16 weeks, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work.

James Adams, 23, also of Steynton, Pembrokeshire, received a 12-week jail sentence suspended for a year with 150 hours unpaid work and a year's driving ban.
