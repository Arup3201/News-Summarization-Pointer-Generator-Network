Tulisa Contostavlos has confirmed speculation she will not be returning to The X Factor judging panel.

The former N-Dubz singer, 24, announced the news on her Twitter page on Tuesday, declaring it was 'time to do something different'.

The pop star's announcement follows months of speculation Simon Cowell was looking to shake up the judging panel this year after a slump in viewing figures.

Big decision: Tulisa revealed she wouldn't be returning to The X Factor for a third series on Tuesday

She wrote: 'Just wanted to let you all know that I 
won't be part of the X Factor panel this year. I've had a great time on 
the show, but this year it's time to do something different.

'I'd like to
 thank everyone on The X Factor for two amazing years. Stay tuned as I 
have a very exciting announcement soon!'

Tulisa's decision to depart following two years on the ITV talent show comes as veteran judge Louis Walsh confirmed he would be returning alongside Gary Barlow.

The Irish music manager also gave a strong hint that Sharon Osbourne - who left the panel after the 2007 series - was returning.

He told RTE Ten: 'I'm back, I am definitely back. Me and 
Gary, we're the bookends and I'm sure Sharon Osbourne's back and I 
helped to get her back, because she's great fun.'

Earlier this month, reports claimed Sharon was being lured back with a Â£1.5million deal.

However, Louis was in the dark over whether or not Nicole Scherzinger would return after she joined last year as a replacement for Kelly Rowland.

He added: 'I hope it's going to be Tulisa or Nicole. It might be Mel B, I don't know! But I think it probably will be Nicole.'

In an interview with the MailOnline in March, Nicole admitted she hadn't made up her mind about returning following a year on the UK series and the previous year on the US version.

She said: 'I'm definitely dancing around with the idea. The show was one of my greatest highs from next year, having two of my contestants in the next two for the first time ever on the show was quite an accomplishment for me and for my boys.

'But we're just going to have to see.'
