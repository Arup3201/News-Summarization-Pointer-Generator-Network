More than a hundred fans of a YouTube diet guru famous for eating 51 bananas in a day reportedly turned up outside an Adelaide court today to protest a lawsuit being brought against her by a popular Australian fitness blogger. 

Kayla Itsines, 23, the brains behind the popular Bikini Body Guide, her partner and company lodged a lawsuit last month alleging that Leanne Ratcliffe, better known as Freelee the Banana Girl, and her vegan partner Harley Johnstone, known as Durianrider, had defamed them in a series of online posts.

Prior to a hearing at the South Australian Supreme Court today, the Adelaide Advertiser reported that the large crowd of Freelee's supporters appeared and repeatedly chanted the 'fruitarian' duo's slogan, 'carb the f*** up'.

In a fiery Facebook post to her 2.3 million followers last month, Ms Itsines alleged Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone made false claims on YouTube that her partner was on steroids, that she was starving herself or other people and that she was a fraud. 

'This is wrong and illegal,' she wrote. 

'So I have requested that the content be removed from the internet. 

'After my initial request was denied I had no choice but to continue to protect the safety and reputation of my followers, Tobi and myself from a personal point of view.'

Ms Itsines lodged an injunction to the South Australian Supreme Court in February. 

Her legal representative, Andrew Harris QC, reportedly told Judge Brian Withers at Monday's hearing that Mr Johnstone and Ms Ratcliffe had not complied with the request. He said they had kept the videos on YouTube but set to 'private'. 

Judge Withers told the court the matter should head straight to trial. Mr Harris was quoted saying that there was still a prospect of mediation between the parties in the next seven days. The hearing was adjourned until next week. 

The presence of a large number of supporters for Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone came after they issued a video request for 'fruit bats' to attend court to support them. 

'Good will prevail!' Ms Ratcliffe said in the video. 'The fruit bats will prevail!'
