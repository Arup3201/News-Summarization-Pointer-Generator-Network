Defence Minister David Johnston and his Chief Of Staff Sean Costello indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials who are chasing lucrative government contracts.

Dining receipts obtained by News Corp journalist Ian McPhedran show Mr Johnston, Mr Costello and defence industry executives spent $6384 of taxpayers money in pricey restaurants during November.

The revelations of the meals - often washed down with $200 bottles of wine - come as ordinary troops in Australia's armed services face cuts to their entitlements and a 1.5 per cent pay increase which is below the rate of inflation.

A spokesman for the Defence Minister told Daily Mail Australia that the spending was all within guidelines.

Receipts showing thousands of taxpayers dollars being spent on lavish meals by Defence Minister David Johnson have been revealed, with this $662 receipt from Sean's Kitchen in Adelaide

'All hospitality hosted by the Defence Minister and extended to foreign dignitaries or industry heads, including at the time of the Albany Commemoration, has been within guidelines and is consistent with previous Defence Ministers’ practice,' the spokesperson said. 

The first lavish dinner took place on November 2 at Perth's Matilda Bay Restaurant, where rib eye steaks, lamb and snapper along with three bottles of Henschke Mt Edlestone Shiraz at $190 a bottle contributed to the $2332 bill, News Corp reported. 

The prestigious establishment has waterfront views of the Swan River. 

Just a few days later, on November 5, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello were in Adelaide dining with Bruce Carter, chairman of submarine builder ASC and one of the companies chasing government work, sources told News Corp.

The trio polished off two bottles of $143 shiraz at Sean's Kitchen, and two martinis at $20 each, according to the $662 receipt.

The next stop was Balthazar Restaurant in Perth where the $722 bill - again racked up between just three people - included two $172 bottles of Omensetter Shiraz, two pork fillets and a cheese platter, News Corp reported.

For the November 12 dinner, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello shared a meal and a few drinks with 'a senior executive from Austal.' Shipbuilder Austal is also seeking defence work from the government according to News Corp.

Matilda Bay in Perth was revisited on November 15 where the bill racked up by seven guests at the waterfront restaurant was $2062.

Rib eye steaks were on the menu again, as were two bottles of Picardy Chardonnay at $170 a pop.

The final dinner destination for November was the Courgette in Canberra, where Mr Johnston and Mr Costello were joined by two others, totalling $599 for dinner and drinks.  

In stark contrast, ordinary defence personnel who travel on business are afforded allowances of $24 for breakfast, $28 for lunch and $47 for dinner.
