A newly declassified report reveals the U.S. military considered building a surveillance station on the moon a full decade before the first astronauts set foot on its surface.

The report, codenamed 'Project Horizon,' was finally declassified Sunday on the 45th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's moonwalk.

Had it been implemented, the military would have installed a moon-to-Earth surveillance system for 'facilitating communications with and observation of the earth.'

Published in 1959, the full document is more than 100 pages.

Though their initial ideas about testing nuclear weapons never came to pass, the military has created a powerful network of satellites to monitor the world.  A top-secret rocket carrying spy 
satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office launched in 2013 and spy satellites have been instrumental in determining the sequence of events that downed Malaysia Airlines MH17. 

ABC News reports the the proposal also discusses a weapons system on the moon that would have allowed for weapons to be launched not only towards the planet's surface but into outer space.

There was also considered of detonating a nuclear bomb on or near the moon to study its effects.

The report's authors speculate on just what effect the resulting radiation might have on aliens. 

The report follows declassification of a 
second report, 'The Kidnapping of the Lunik,' which details American 
operatives stealing then returning the Lunik Soviet space capsule while 
it was on an exhibition tour.

As Wired reported in a recent story on Malaysia
 Airlines MH17, the U.S. Air Defense Support Program currently operates 
multiple satellites around the planet to watch for any warning signs of 
weapons or spacecraft being launched.

The system uses infrared cameras and can pick up even trace heat signatures.

They were 
especially helpful during the country's first incursion into Iraq as 
they could detect early warning signs of Scud missile launches.

More 
recently, this was used to detect the launch site of the weaponry that 
downed Malaysia Airlines MH17, and gave evidence to authorities 
statements shortly after the crash that the flight was shot down with a  surface-to-air missile.

And last year amid fears over domestic spying, a top-secret rocket carrying spy 
satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office launched from the 
central California coast with a large badge 
emblazoned on the side

The 
new logo features a huge and sinister octopus, with just one angry eye 
visible, as it wraps its tentacles round the globe. Written underneath 
is: 'Nothing Is Beyond Our Reach.'

The 19-story-tall rocket carried items for the NRO, which operates the U.S. system of intelligence-gathering satellites.
