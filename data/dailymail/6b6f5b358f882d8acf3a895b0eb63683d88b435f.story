The NHS has started to ‘cross the Rubicon’ in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal as thousands of whistleblowers speak out, the Health Secretary will say today.

Jeremy Hunt will highlight a big increase in NHS staff airing concerns about patient safety, death rates and poor care, with almost 8,000 cases raised in the past ten months.

He will also say that 49 senior NHS bosses have been replaced – most because they ‘weren’t up to the job’.

The Health Secretary is expected to point to a scheme ensuring nursing students ‘get their hands dirty’ by working for a year as healthcare assistants as evidence of progress.

An increase in hospitals putting the name of one ‘responsible doctor’ above each patient’s bed will also be underlined.

Mr Hunt argues that creating a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ across the NHS is vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which as many as 1,200 patients died.

The Government has barred so-called ‘compromise agreements’ – which mean NHS staff cannot raise anything embarrassing to their employers when they leave their jobs – throughout the health service with immediate effect.

Staff have also been given a specific legal right to blow the whistle on issues such as patient care and safety, or anything that could be in the public interest.

In a speech on the eve of the first anniversary of the Francis Inquiry into Mid Staffs, Mr Hunt will say there have been 7,626 calls to a new hotline for whistleblowers working in the NHS since last April.

He will claim that the ‘Francis effect’ has meant more failing hospitals being identified and put on the road to recovery.

‘Most weeks I join staff in different parts of the country on a shift, and I have seen first-hand how hospitals are using the Francis report as a catalyst to improve care,’ Mr Hunt will say.

‘Twelve months on, we cannot expect to have solved everything or to have completely transformed the culture of the country’s largest and finest institution.

‘But we have seen a real shift in priorities – new inspections, more nurses and a stronger voice for patients, with compassionate care starting to replace tick-box targets as the major focus on boards and wards.

He will add: ‘Our goal is safe and compassionate care as the hallmark of every hospital and experience of every single patient and family.

'As the NHS starts to cross this Rubicon, we must pay tribute to the hard work of NHS staff as well as the whistle-blowers and patients’ champions who refused to be silenced.’

Mr Hunt is expected to highlight the example of Helene Donnelly, an A&E nurse who faced ‘bullying and harassment when she spoke out about poor care at Mid Staffordshire’.

He will highlight further changes since the Francis Inquiry, including an extra 2,400 hospital nurses hired in the last year, with 3,575 nurses working on NHS wards and 6,000 more clinical staff overall since the 2010 election.

Nearly 40 per cent of hospitals now have the names of a senior responsible doctor above patients’ beds, and the first 165 nursing students are piloting the new training approach.

Jamie Reed, Labour’s shadow health minister, said the Coalition had presided over ‘the loss of thousands of NHS nurses’ and that the Government was ‘making care failures more likely’.

He added: ‘It is yet more proof that you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’
