John Carver says Alan Pardew ranks as one of the best managers he has worked with – including Sir Bobby Robson – and has backed him to be a success at Crystal Palace.

The Newcastle assistant boss is now in charge of first-team affairs with Pardew set to be unveiled at Selhurst Park.

Carver was shocked at the news of Pardew’s exit but believes he will prove a hit at Palace.

John Carver has worked under Alan Pardew for four-and-a-half seasons at Newcastle

Pardew is set to be announced as the new Crystal Palace manager imminently

‘Absolutely he’ll be a success,’ he said.

‘I’ve worked with him, so I know what he’s all about. I know the job he’s done here, and let’s not forget some of the people that I’ve worked with.

‘You go back to Kevin Keegan, Ruud Gullit, Kenny Dalglish, Sir Bobby Robson – all top managers. He’s up there with them, and I’ve said that on a number of occasions.

‘He’s a fantastic coach, a great organiser and a great man manager. He left people to get on with their jobs, and delegated responsibility, which is very important. I’ve got the utmost respect for him.’

Carver could land the Newcastle job on a permanent basis should he impress over the coming games against Burnley and Leicester.

And he admits he still has aspirations of being the main man.

John Carver could take over at Newcastle until at least the end of the season

‘I think you always have those ambitions don’t you, but you’ve got to wait for the right opportunity,’ he said.

‘Now the manager looks like going, what’s my situation? Only time will tell. My head’s going 100 miles an hour here, as you can imagine.

‘I think that every coach who goes into football wants to be a manager, and there will be a day when I want to be a manager again, there’s no doubt about that.’
