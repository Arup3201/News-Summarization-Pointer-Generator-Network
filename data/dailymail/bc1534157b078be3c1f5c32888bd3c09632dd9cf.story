Spoiled teen Rachel Canning may have abandoned her controversial legal battle to sue her parents, but she has not given up on her party lifestyle - or the boyfriend her mom and dad banned her from seeing.

The cheerleader – who made international headlines after she took her parents to court to accuse them of abandoning her – posted a string of pictures on her public Facebook page last week showing her at a wild high school blowout.

In some of the snaps - contained in an album called, 'Seniors' - Rachel, 18, is seen clutching a plastic cup and in one ‘action shot’ she is shown taking a huge swig.

Wild: Rachel posted pictures of herself at the high school party just weeks after it emerged she moved back in to the home of her parents she sued for abandoning her. She had refused to live by their rules which they drew up in response to concerns she was drinking too much

Smooch: Canning, 18, was pictured in high spirits and kissing boys at the raucous event. She was no doubt celebrating the fact that she had secured a $56,000 scholarship to college

Banned: Boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller, far left, was also at the party. Rachel launched the legal action against her parents when they said she could not go out with him if she wanted to live at home

The teen is pictured with a number of different boys – planting a kiss on one – but more importantly her boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller features in one of the images.

Rachel’s parents Sean and Elizabeth - who have easy access to the snaps - expressly banned her from seeing Lucas, 18, after they accused him of leading their daughter astray and making her, ‘obsessed with drinking every weekend’.

In fact her drinking and her relationship with Lucas were the main reasons for the explosive fall out experienced by the Cannings. Last November, soon after moving out of the family home in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, Rachel sent her father an email saying she was ready to come back.

Sean, a former police chief, responded, writing: ‘As far as the boyfriend, yeah, you might not agree and sure you don't but that has been as much a drag on you as anything, if you're home he's not around or involved in your life.'

Furious Rachel responded 'Well I'm not coming home if I can't see him'. That was their last correspondence until they met in Morris County Court on March 5.

Between those dates Rachel lived at the home of her best friend’s father, John Inglesino, a high powered lawyer who actually funded her legal battle.

In the lawsuit, Sean and Elizabeth were accused of abandoning their daughter and told they needed to pay for her private school tuition, her university fees and her legal bills.

Back home: Rachel's parents have welcomed her back to their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, pictured. But it was assumed she would then have to tow the line

Their counter argument centered on Rachel’s drinking and her relationship with Lucas. In incendiary court papers, Elizabeth laid into her daughter, Lucas and even his parents.

She wrote: ‘Prior her dating him, Rachel had been dating another boy through the summer of 2013 where they rarely, if ever engaged in the heavy partying that was being exhibited nonstop in the fall of 2013.

‘She (Rachel) was routinely bought home drunk by the Kitzmillers, well past her curfew…

‘In ignoring our very lenient rules and curfews, it became the normal fashion on weekends for Lucas’ father or mother to drive Lucas and Rachel home from whatever party they were able to find around the country.’

Referencing one particular incident, she said: ‘On that particular night Lucas’ father drove her home drunk and dropped her off at our home at 3.30am.’

Lucas also faced the brunt of the Canning family anger when it came to her disciplinary problems at school. 

Elizabeth said he was present when Rachel was suspended from Morris Catholic High School, explaining: ‘Upon Rachel’s return to school (following a first suspension) she cut school with Lucas Kitzmiller and called into school herself purporting to be me.

‘On October 29, 2014 the night before she left, we had told her she could no longer see her boyfriend due to the suspension and his poor influence on her and we took away her phone and car privileges.

Worse for wear: Rachel posted a picture of this boy who looked as if he passed out drunk in the yard

‘Upon suspension, she attended work with her father… Despite our having imposed a punishment for the suspension she was picked up by her unsupervised and also suspended boyfriend, Lucas Kitzmiller… within an hour of arriving there…. She went to the Kitzmiller’s home.

‘Mrs Kitzmiller contacted me at work stating that she had both Rachel and her son, Lucas, at her house and that for the sake of our children, that I needed to contact Morris Catholic and tell them that Rachel had my permission to be at her house.

‘I vociferously refused to comply with this and indicated to Mrs. Kitzmiller that they needed to be accountable for their actions…

‘I was attempting to exert moral legal parental authority over daughter despite the enabling and parental interfering behavior of Mrs. Kitzmiller, which undermined our parenting and rules.’

Those statements led to a war of words between the Cannings and the Kitzmillers. Speaking to MailOnline last month Lucas’ dad Jeffery said: ‘My son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the Cannings.

'Their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands. That's the only interaction they have ever had. They made their decision about him from that.

'If you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she's had it's always the boyfriend who's the bad influence. We have been dragged into this.’

But it seems that bad blood has not changed Rachel and Lucas' feeling towards each other.

Following months of recriminations the case went to court and Judge Peter Bogaard made it immediately clear that he was not sympathetic to Rachel’s arguments.

After reading an expletive-laden and vicious answerphone message left by Rachel Canning to Elizabeth, in which the girl said: 'I wanna s*** all over your face', he said: 'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house.’

The judge added that Rachel had given her mom and dad: ‘The proverbial f you’. He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?'

Seemingly realizing she was fighting a losing battle Rachel agreed to move back into her parents’ house the following week and dropped the lawsuit.

Holding it together: Rachel didn't look in such a bad state compared to those she was partying with

Disrespect: The judge overseeing the case asked: 'Have you ever seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house' after he read a foul answerphone message Rachel had left her mother

But if her Facebook pictures are anything to go by she has not changed her lifestyle and is still hanging out with Lucas, something which is sure to anger her parents.

On top of that it seems she has also got her parents to agree to part-fund her college education, the main reason for launching the lawsuit.

Rachel announced on her Facebook page in a public post on March 29 that she plans to attend Western New England University as a biomedical engineering major on a $56,000 scholarship.

She wrote: ‘Decision made. WNE U class of 2018 BME Major w/ 56,000$ scholarship.’

A Western New England spokesman confirmed to the Daily Record that Canning was accepted into the private school in Massachusetts.

In an email to USA Today, they added: ‘Western New England University routinely offers merit scholarships to incoming freshmen based on academic achievement. ... These merit scholarships can total between $22,000 and $66,000 over the course of four years.’

One year of tuition at the school for an undergraduate engineering student is $32,606, and room and board is an additional $12,700, according to the university website.
