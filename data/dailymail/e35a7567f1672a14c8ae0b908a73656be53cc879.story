Floyd Mayweather has once again called out welterweight rival Manny Pacquiao but poured cold water on talk of a fight with Amir Khan because 'no one has heard of him'.

Mayweather and Pacquiao's meeting has been five years in the making with speculation now rife that the richest fight in boxing history is close to being made.

Khan was hopeful of getting his chance to get in the ring with the American star but the 37-year-old says of the Briton 'his name holds no weight', making the prospective encounter extremely unlikely.

Speaking to Boxing Scene after his victory against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas, Khan, who was pictured on Wednesday arriving back at Manchester Airport, said: 'The Mayweather fight, I think, definitely should happen. I have proven myself not once, but twice.'

However, the WBA, WBC and Ring champion does not seem impressed with the crowd the Bolton-born boxer draws.

'The other night I think he did 4,000 (attendance), so, Amir Khan, his name holds no weight,' Mayweather told reporters during the World Boxing Council convention.

'No one knows who Amir Khan is, except for people who are involved in boxing.

'My focus is Manny Pacquiao. Let's make it happen.'

Earlier this week, Pacquiao, an eight-division champion and current WBO welterweight holder, said Mayweather had 'nowhere else to run' as talk ramped up about a high-profile fight.

As he enjoyed himself on his 36th birthday at home, Pacquiao refused to dwell on the latest rant from Mayweather.

'I don't want to talk and even think about him because it will only spoil my day,' he said prior to his grand celebration.

Mayweather admits that talks about the fight are happening behind the scenes and he has pencilled in a May 2 date for who he says will be his next opponent.

It is estimated that the fight will gross a minimum $300million. Pacquiao has agreed to take the thin end of the 60-40 split, although there are suggestions that Mayweather may demand an even higher percentage if an agreement is to be finalised.

It is probable that the Money Man will insist on fighting in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas as usual. But Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum has been proposing the erection of a pop-up stadium in the famous Strip with a 50,000 capacity, more than double that of any existing arena in Sin City.

December 5, 2009: ESPN report Pacquiao has signed a contract to fight Mayweather which the Filipino later denies.

December 11: Yahoo report an eight-page contract was sent to Pacquiao with a proposed date of March 13, 2010.

December 30: Pacquiao sues Mayweather, alleging him of making defamatory statements regarding performance-enhancing drugs.

July 13, 2010: Arum gives Mayweather a week to sign the contract for the fight.

July 19: Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon denies negotiations have ever taken place.

January 20, 2012: EPSN reports that Mayweather spoke to Pacquiao on the phone and offered him $40m but Pacquiao demanded a 55/45 split in Mayweather's favour.

September 25: Mayweather and Pacquiao reach a settlement in their defamation case.

December 20, 2013: Mayweather says the fight will never happen while Pacquiao is promoted by Bob Arum.

January, 2014: Pacquiao challenges Mayweather to fight him but to donate all proceeds to charity.

November 22: Pacquiao beats Algieri and tells Mayweather: 'The fans deserve the fight, I think it's time to make it happen'.
