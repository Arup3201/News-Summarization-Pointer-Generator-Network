Graphic, disturbing and 'beyond pornographic' images are believed to have been found on Gary Giordano's camera of missing Maryland woman Robyn Gardner, calling into question the relationship between them, who were at first believed to simply be travelling companions.

Giordano's camera, as well as his laptop and cell phone, have been sent away for analysis.

Solicitor general of Aruba Taco Stein - who called the 50-year-old a 'mean b******' - could not confirm the nature of the images to the Today Show but would only say it did not look like she was under any duress.

Meanwhile it emerged that the Maryland businessman tried to collect the $1.5million accidental death policy he took out on her just two days after he reported her disappearance to police.

Giordano, who purchased the accidental policy shortly before travelling to the Dutch Caribbean island with the 35-year-old, tried to begin redeeming the American Express policy, which he took out just days before their trip and unusually only covered the trip to Aruba.

According to a police source, Giordano 
purchased a more expensive one-year policy instead of a more commonly 
purchased five year policy.

Authorities today were preparing a massive search of the island for the missing woman’s body or evidence in the case.

Their search will be focused on the most southern, rural parts of the island which is more desert-like and uninhabited.

Giordano - a twice divorced father-of-three -  is still fighting the accusations and is being held in an Aruban prison.

He still denies anything to do with Robyn's disappearance and claims she vanished while they were out snorkelling.

Being held: A judge on Monday granted a request from Aruban prosecutors to extend the detention of Giordano for 16 days

On Monday Giordano was ordered to remain in an Aruban jail for another 16 days while police investigate 'serious inconsistencies' in his account of events.

The American Express accidental policy is currently being investigated by the FBI.

Court documents show the 50-year-old has a history of domestic violence, has not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case.

His attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail.

Officers having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.

The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday

Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing.

Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate.

Surveillance footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen.

Police said that they found blood on a rock behind the dive shop at the restaurant.
