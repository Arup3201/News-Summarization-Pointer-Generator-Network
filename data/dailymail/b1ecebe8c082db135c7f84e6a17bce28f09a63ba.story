Chelsea and Everton have both been fined £30,000 by the FA for player misconduct in their February 11 clash at Stamford Bridge.

Players from both teams became embroiled in a melee four minutes before the end of Chelsea's 1-0 win, and the clubs have now been charged with 'failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour'.

The charge against Chelsea also claims that their players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss 'and/or became involved in a mass confrontation'.

Branislav Ivanovic escaped a personal punishment despite appearing to aim a headbutt at Everton's James McCarthy during the incident.

Chelsea and Everton both admitted the charges and were  warned about their future conduct.

The incident sparked up after a Gareth Barry's foul on Willian that saw him dismissed for a second bookable offence. Referee Moss also showed cards to McCarthy, Cesc Fabregas and Ramires after the coming together.

After the game Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho walked out of a BBC interview when asked about the Ivanovic incident and when questioned by BT Sport, he replied: ‘Don’t make me laugh, don’t make me laugh.’

In his post-match press conference, Mourinho threatened another walk-out, saying: ‘I’m concerned with my reaction because one more question (about this) and I will leave.’ 

Mourinho was critical of Everton, adding: ‘They made lots of fouls, what you would call intelligent fouls, but if the referee follows the rule it’s yellow card after yellow card and then inevitably you get a red card — which they eventually did.’

Everton manager Roberto Martinez was in no doubt that Ivanovic should have seen red over the alleged butt.

‘If you look at the images Ivanovic’s behaviour is wrong,’ said Martinez. ‘He grabs him around the neck in a forceful manner then puts his head against him when James McCarthy didn’t react, and if you want to be on top of the laws that’s a red card.’
