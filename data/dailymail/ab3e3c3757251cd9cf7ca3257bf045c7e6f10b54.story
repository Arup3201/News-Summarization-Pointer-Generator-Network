A Victorian man who blew himself up during a five-hour siege with police was wearing a homemade bomb vest but did not intentionally trigger it, a court has heard.

Counsel assisting the coroner Jessica Wilby said on Wednesday that Glenn Saunders, 48, had explosives strapped to a vest he was wearing during the tense stand-off with police outside his home.

But a separate explosion inside the house, five hours after the siege began, startled the former mechanic, who moved his arms in the air detonating the pull-chord device.

She also said Mr Sanders may not have had any intention of harming police, who arrived at the property about 6.45pm on April 11 to arrest him for a separate matter.

The siege lasted until the early hours of April 12 before the explosives killed Mr Sanders.

Police are still awaiting an autopsy report to be completed, and a further briefing document will be provided to Coroner John Olle by September 6.

A decision will then be made on whether to hold an inquest into the death.

Meanwhile, residents of the town have previously said how Mr Sanders' life began to spiral out of control after the death of his wife 18 months ago.

They called his sanity into question, saying he was was known to walk around with explosives strapped to his chest for no apparent reason.

But despite his troubled past and questionable sanity, a Derrinallum resident told the Herald Sun he would be missed.

'He was a clever country bloke, there was nothing he couldn’t do or make,' he said.

'He was down to earth and he’d do anything for you ... All the farmers around here would go to him.'
