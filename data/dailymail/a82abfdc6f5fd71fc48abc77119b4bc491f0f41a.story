David Cameron's claim to be taking a 'tantric' approach to making policy on Europe has made him the star of an hilarious cartoon ridiculing his long-awaited Big Speech.

The infamous team of Taiwanese animators from NMA.tv show the Prime Minister in bed working on his much-hyped address, before portraying as unable to hold back a mob of Europeans at the gates of Buckingham Palace.

He is also shown with his finger in a dike trying to plug leaks of his speech, being clobbered with an oar by Margaret Thatcher and sitting with a crying Nick Clegg on his lap.

Between the sheets: The Taiwanese animation shows David Cameron struggling to formulate his EU policy

The PM claimed he was taking a 'tantric approach' to his EU speech, claiming it will 'be even better when it does eventually come'

The video will do little to alter the impression that the Prime Minister is losing his grip on his landmark address, due to be given on Friday morning in Amsterdam.

In the Commons today he was today accused of creating five years of uncertainty which will leave Britain ‘closed for business’ for investors.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the PM had ‘lost control’ of the Tory party over the issue of Europe and thrown investment in the economy into doubt ahead of his big speech on Friday in which he will promise to hold a referendum.

Attacking Mr Cameron as a ‘weak Prime 
Minister’ leading a ‘divided party’, Mr Miliband mocked the Tory leader 
for once warning that his party had to stop ‘banging on about Europe’.

The mocking continued in the NMA video, which has been circulating in Westminster all day.

The animators have seized on Mr Cameron's bizarre defence for why he had not delivered his speech sooner.

'This is a tantric approach to policy-making,' he said last month. 'It will be even better when it does eventually come.'

The cartoon shows the PM in bed struggling to formulate his policy, before showing a group waving European flags breaking down gates to confront him.

It also shows many people voting that 
Britain is 'better of out' of the EU, but the idea has upset Mr Clegg, 
the Deputy Prime Minister, who is shown in a baby harness crying his 
eyes out.

But the video warns that Mr Cameron risks being sunk by the issue of Europe like his predecessors, showing Baroness Thatcher in a rowing boat wielding an oar.

The team have previously made videos about Cleggmania, during the 2010 election campaign and Gordon Brown calling a Labour voter a 'bigot'.

David Cameron dodged a question on whether he thought Britain would still be in the EU in five years' time as Labour's Ed Miliband claimed the Prime Minister was taking an 'unnecessary gamble'

Mr Cameron is due to deliver his long-awaited speech in Amsterdam on Friday, when he will set out how he hopes to negotiate for Brussels to return powers to London before giving the British people a vote on accepting the ‘fresh settlement’.

But amid growing signs of chaos in Tory ranks, the Daily Mail revealed Mr Cameron has agreed Tory Cabinet ministers would be free to campaign against each other in the referendum, which is unlikely to be held until 2018.

Downing Street today launched a charm offensive to win over Eurosceptic Tory MPs, inviting them to Number 10 to brief them on Mr Cameron's plans.

In the Commons, Mr Miliband claimed the reason Mr Cameron had been bounced into making a speech on Europe 'is nothing to do with the national interest - it's because he has lost control of his party'.

Mr Miliband said the uncertainty created by talks about renegotiation and whether a referendum would pave the way for Britain to exit Europe would hit the economy: ‘His position appears to be this: an in out referendum now would be de-stabilising but promising one in five years time would be just fine for the country.

‘What does that mean? Five years of businesses seeing a “closed for business” sign hanging around Britain.’

Tory grandee Lord Heseltine had said the policy was an ‘unnecessary gamble’, Mr Miliband added.

Lord Heseltine told the Financial Times: 'Mrs Thatcher said "Never go into a room unless you know how to get out of it."

'To commit to a referendum about a negotiation that hasn't begun, on a timescale you cannot predict, on an outcome that's unknown, where Britain's appeal as an inward investment market would be the centre of the debate, seems to me like an unnecessary gamble.'

A group of 100 Conservative MPs launched a ‘shopping list’ of powers they want the 
UK to reclaim from Brussels.

The Fresh Start group is highlighting 
powers over home affairs and justice, employment rules, energy and 
agriculture that it says should be clawed back.

The MPs, who have been working closely
with Foreign Secretary William Hague and other ministers, suggest 
threatening to withhold funds from some EU schemes if powers are not 
returned.

'Many of the 
proposals are already Government policy, some could well become future 
Government or Conservative Party policy and some may require further 
thought,' Mr Hague said in a foreword to the report.

Tory
MP Andrew Leadsom, a leading member of the group, said: 'I think it’s a
bit simple to say we want to return to the Common Market, I guess if 
you were to say that our priority is more trade and less of the other 
stuff, that’s true.

'But 
there are other areas where we can co-operate very happily and 
constructively with the EU, but what we’re actually trying to recognize 
is that the status quo isn’t an option as the eurozone moves towards 
ever greater fiscal union.'

But Mr Cameron said he had long disagreed with the former Tory Deputy PM on the issue of Europe.

As many as nine Tory 
Cabinet ministers are thought to back a British exit if significant 
powers cannot be repatriated from Brussels.

As a result, Mr Cameron has agreed 
that Cabinet ministers will be able to campaign to leave the EU, when he
eventually holds a referendum.

A senior source said: ‘Different 
ministers and different MPs are going to have different points of view 
which they will want to raise and campaign on.’

In
the Commons, Mr Cameron refused to say whether he thought Britain would
still be in the EU in five years time, only saying he thought ‘Britain 
is better off in the European Union’.

The PM added: 'I think that even the leader of the Labour Party should accept the fact that there is a massive change taking place in Europe, a change that is being driven by the changes in the eurozone.

'Frankly, this country faces the choice, and political parties in this country face a choice: do we look at these changes and see what we can do to maximise Britain's national interest, and do we consult the public about that, or do we sit back, do nothing and tell the public to go hang?

'I know where I stand, I know where this party stands, and that's in the national interest.'

The clash in the Commons came hours after a group of 100 Tory MPs launched a shopping list of powers they want to see repatriated.

The Fresh Start group wants powers over home affairs and justice, employment rules, energy and agriculture to be clawed back.

Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote the foreword to the group’s report, claiming many of the ideas could become Tory policy.

But Mr Miliband said Mr Hague had flown out of the country to get as far away from Mr Cameron’s Europe speech as possible.

The Prime Minister spent the afternoon briefing Tory ministers and MPs on his plans, in an attempt to prevent a collapse in support in the immediate aftermath of his speech on Friday
