Survivor: Phil Woodbridge came through the potentially fatal accident unscathed thanks to his quick reactions and sturdy car

A 25-year-old man has survived a 40 tonne truck falling onto the roof of his car after it smashed into a bridge.

Phil Woodbridge, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, swerved onto the pavement and escaped through his passenger door as the HGV landed on his roof directly above him in Brinnington.

The sales manager was travelling to work by an unusual route because of the huge fire at the recycling plant nearby in Bredbury.

Miraculously the roof of his Audi A3 - which he bought last month - only gave way slightly under the lorry’s weight and Phil was able to jump out of the passenger side uninjured.

He said: 'It was a horrible situation. I heard the lorry hit something and it started to topple over, I dropped it into second gear to get some speed up and swerved onto the pavement.

'As it hit I ducked my head down and undid my seatbelt and jumped out as quick as I could. The whole thing was in slow motion. The instinct was to swerve and the car saved me.

'I only bought it four weeks ago, afterwards I just stood staring at it. If I’d stayed on the road I would have been crushed. It started to hit me that night when I began thinking about it.

'But I’ve not got a single mark on me. Hopefully I’ll get another Audi, the police said the picture of the lorry on it would be a great advert for them.'

The lorry driver, a 34-year-old man, was also able to climb out of his cab, also uninjured after the crash on Thursday morning.

Trains from Manchester Piccadilly to Sheffield were also delayed while the bridge was inspected and passed as safe. Firefighters were called to the accident at 10.50am.

Close call: The lorry fell onto the driver's side of the car. Mr Woodbridge swerved onto the pavement and escaped through his passenger door and the full force of the vehicle smashed his windscreen

Rescue: Miraculously, the lorry driver was also unhurt. Trains were delayed while the bridge was inspected

Watch manager Steve Johnson, from Offerton fire station, said: 'The man ducked out of the way when he saw the lorry falling.

'It landed above his head but because the car is sturdy it held up to the weight.

'A 40 tonne lorry falling onto a car could have potentially been fatal.'
