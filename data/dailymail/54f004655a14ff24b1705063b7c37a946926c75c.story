One of the last people to see Lord Lucan has claimed that the missing peer was driven to kill after a pet kitten he bought for his children had its throat cut and was posted through his letter box.

George Weiss  said that Lucan, who vanished in 1974, had bought the kitten from Harrods and sent it to his estranged wife Veronica and their children at their home in London's Belgravia.

However, when Lucan discovered the animal had been posted back through his letter box with its throat cut, it pushed him into attacking Lady Lucan and killing his children's nanny Sandra Rivett, according to Mr Weiss.

'He saw no way back into family life and the life of his children. It tipped him over the edge and it made him decide to uncreate his wife,' Mr Weiss, now 74, told the Daily Mirror's David Collins. 

Mr Weiss had seen Lucan at the Clermont Club in Mayfair on November 6, 1974 - the day before the murder - and the pair had played backgammon.

He said Lucan, who was facing heavy gambling losses at the time, hardly spoke, and had been acting strangely when he saw him at the club, and when he asked what was the matter, Lucan had replied nothing was wrong.

Theory: It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Sandra Rivett (left) for his wife Veronica (right) and hit her with lead piping. Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant

Couple: Lord and Lady Lucan had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street

Victim: Mrs Rivett's body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house

'And seeing him sitting across from me on our usual backgammon table the day before the murder is an image that has stayed with me for the last 40 years,' said Mr Weiss, who was also friends with the late comedian Peter Cook and Charles Saatchi.

'I believe he was plotting his wife’s murder. He was in a world of his own, playing as if he were on autopilot.'

Mr Weiss then asked another friend, financier Stephen Raphael, if he knew why Lucan seemed so distant.

Family: Mr Weiss says the cat had been purchased by Lucan for his three children, pictured with their mother the month after their father's disappearance

He said Mr Raphael then told him that Lucan had bought the kitten for his children to cheer them up during the acrimonious separation from Lady Lucan and their bitter custody battle.

The couple had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street. 

Mr Weiss said Lucan had taken the cat to the family home, but just hours later it was posted through his letter box  with its throat cut.

Wife: Lady Lucan, pictured earlier this year, believes her husband took his own life after the crime

Mr Weiss said Lucan had been at the Clermont from 4.30pm until 7.30pm when he left for a restaurant. It was the last time he ever saw him. 

The next day, November 7, 1974, Mrs Rivett's murder and Lucan's subsequent disappearance would spark Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt.

It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife and hit her with lead piping. Her body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house.

Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation he telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, Sussex.

Hours later, he left the property and was never seen again. The Corsair was later found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene.

A warrant for his arrest was issued a few days later and in his absence, the inquest into Mrs Rivett's death named him as her murderer - the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court was allowed to do so. 

Lucan, who would  be celebrating his 80th birthday next month, was never seen again. In 1999 his family was granted probate over his estate, although no death certificate was issued.

However, there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa as the mystery continues to capture the public's imagination. 

His half-brother Hugh Bingham said last year that Lucan died in 2004 and is buried in Africa, while his son George Bingham has said that he believes his father drowned in the English channel. 

His youngest daughter, Lady Camilla Bloch QC, who was four at the time of the murder, said last year that it was important to remember that her father had never stood trial and insisted that evidence against him was ‘circumstantial’.

Lady Lucan, now 76, has said she is bored with the constant claims that her husband might still be alive and of the numerous unconfirmed sightings of him.

She is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him.
