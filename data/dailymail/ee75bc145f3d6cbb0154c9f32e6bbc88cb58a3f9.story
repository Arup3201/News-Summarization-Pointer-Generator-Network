A World War ll bomber pilot is to 
have his dying wish - of military bands striking up again in his 
favourite park - granted thanks to a High Court ruling.

William
'Billy' Higham left £2million of his £7million fortune to the Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust - on condition that the bands
he loved to hear as a boy began playing again at the bandstand in his beloved Mesnes Park in the town.

But Mr Higham made the bequest in a 'home-made' will with vague wording which caused legal confusion.

Music to his ears: Military bands will play again at the Victorian bandstand in Mesnes Park, Wigan, thanks to a bequest from William Higham

War hero: Bomber pilot William Higham left a home-made will which caused legal confusion

Mr Higham's family took the document to 
the High Court in London to get it clarified by a judge.

Mr Justice Mann has now ruled bands must play as the war hero, who died childless at the age of 91 in 2008, would have wished.

Mr
Higham, who flew in an elite bomber squadron during the war, grew up near Mesnes Park and spent his boyhood weekends at the 
bandstand.

The 19th century cast-iron structure is now being restored by the original manufacturers in Glasgow.

After flying Sunderland and Lancaster bombers at the start of the war, Mr Higham was later recruited as a De Havilland Mosquito pilot for a Pathfinder squadron, which spearheaded daring raids into Germany.

Coming out of the airforce, Mr Higham took over his parent's floristry business in Makinson Arcade, Wigan.

The company continues to this day, now operating out of Worthington Way, but Mr Higham retired to the village of St Mawgan, in Cornwall, where he died in September 2008.

Marjorie, his wife of almost 70 years, died of a stroke the following year.

Michael Waterworth, for Mr Higham's nephew, John, told the High Court: 'He was a man of extraordinary energy and ability, who was decisive in business and built up a fortune of £7million.'

Mr Higham's estate included a large collection of paintings by artist James Lawrence Isherwood, whose popularity in the art world has grown exponentially - along with the value of his work - since his death in 1973.

The two men were primary school friends in Wigan in the 1920s and Mr Higham bought a number of works from the hard-up artist in later life.

But the court heard Mr Higham struggled to decide how to divide his wealth, and left a will which was, according to Mr Waterworth, 'difficult to follow'.

Addressing the issue of military band concerts, Stephen Pritchard, for the Leisure and Culture Trust, said: 'The will gives no indication as to the level of performance required... the Trust simply does not know at any given point whether it is adequately performing or not.'

Stripped down: Mr Higham's beloved Victorian bandstand is now being restored to its former glory

The court heard Mr Higham's family were not against the money being left to the Trust, but wanted to make sure it was spent in accordance with his wishes.

After negotiations outside court, lawyers for the family and the Trust agreed a set of rules on how the money should be spent, which they put before Mr Justice Mann to approve.

In his ruling, the judge said: 'The will was home made, without the assistance of solicitors. The result demonstrates what a bad idea it is for a layman to do that, and has led to the expenditure of considerable costs.'

After the decision, Mr Higham's 67-year-old nephew, John Higham, said: 'Billy and his five brothers, all of whom served in the war and all of whom came back, grew up in a house next to the park, and it was a big thing back then to go and hear the bands on Sundays.

'Billy bemoaned the fact that bands had been stopped by the council due to the expense, and he always said "Im going to put the bands back in Wigan".

'I'm very pleased that we have agreed terms that will see big bands from around the country come to the park, as well as giving opportunities to local bands to play there.

'I hope we can arrange for a Lancaster bomber to come flying over, in memory of Billy.'
