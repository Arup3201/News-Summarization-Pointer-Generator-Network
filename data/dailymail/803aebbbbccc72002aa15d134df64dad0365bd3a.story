We give banks our hard-earned cash to look after, and what do we get in return?

Leaflets we can't understand, emollient twaddle about ‘relationships' with people we don't know (or want as new fake friends), charges we weren't expecting, and, if we're really doing well, a free fake leather cover for our cheque book.

As far as I am concerned, bank managers still (erroneously) think they are doing us a favour, when it ought to be the other way round. Recently, I decided to change banks, after my manager's assistant (who I had never met) told me they were allowing me to keep a joint account 'as a favour'.

Bank managers still think they are doing us a favour, when it ought to be the other way round...

This account had only a few hundred quid in it, and was being used to pay household bills. My other accounts were always in credit. Model customer, you might think, except this snooty bank (Coutts) acted like I was a penniless nuisance. They charged me £150 a quarter on the joint account, ludicrous when there were so few transactions.

I decided to move to HSBC, but then my stress levels really started to soar. It's taken five weeks, four different people writing me strings of emails, dozens of incomprehensible forms, and I've ended up with two managers at two different branches!

According to Janet, snooty banks treated her like a penniless pest and charged her extortionate fees

They decided my company credit card could have only a £1,000 limit (even though I was bringing a large business savings account) as if I was an ignorant student, and not someone who has made a living as a broadcaster and writer for over 40 years.

Then, they had the cheek to announce the limit would be increased ‘as a gesture of goodwill' in the light of problems moving my accounts. This makes me even crosser. I don't need a favour, just what I am entitled to  — respect! Stuff a relationship, what about service?

I went to two meetings of an hour and a half each, and now another manager wants to meet ‘to cement our relationship'. No chance. Banks should be there to serve us, not provide staff with chances to have a coffee and see the inside of our house or office.

Banks need to start treating their clients a lot better to prevent the souring relationship between banker and customer

I am not very welcome as a customer because I don't need a mortgage, a loan and advice on investments. I am one of those irritating crumblies who manages to remain afloat all by myself — something banks aren't keen on when they can charge big fees if we exceed our overdraft.

Which? magazine reports that only one in ten of us read the small print when switching banks, because the information they provide is so confusing.

HSBC — and I can vouch for this — hits the jackpot with a 29,000-word document that takes around an hour and a half to read! I am not interested in internet banking, all I want is statements and cash out of a machine.

I haven't even got the details of the ‘free' travel insurance they promised four weeks ago. Then they sent a form asking me to rate my ‘experience'. I put a great big cross right through it — are they paying me to do their research?

It's not surprising that only 40 per cent of ‘extremely dissatisfied' customers (less than 4 per cent of all of us) can face the trauma of switching banks.

Next year, things should improve following a report by the Independent Commission on Banking. Under the new rules, by September 2013, changing banks should take fewer than seven days. If we suffer any inconvenience, we should be able to claim compensation. Good luck! You'll still get a free credit-card wallet easier than a new business loan.

Meanwhile, Douglas Flint, the Chairman of HSBC, says he'd like bankers to sign up to an oath, like doctors, and be monitored by an independent body enforcing a code of conduct. One of the proposed rules would require bankers ‘to act honestly and fairly at all times when dealing with clients'.

I'd go further, how about remembering that old adage ‘the customer is always right'? Mr Flint is said to be looking for new non-executive directors for his board — I'm available and waiting for his call.

Larry taught me how to steal the show

Dallas baddie: Larry as JR Ewing

Cheerio, Larry Hagman, you'll be missed.

Larry was one of the most entertaining actors I ever encountered, far more eccentric than his on-screen persona as the ultimate baddie in Dallas.

When we met at a dinner party in London in the early Eighties, he was smoking a large joint, and announced he spent every Sunday at his home in Malibu in silence, in order to preserve his sanity.

Larry was fabulously indiscreet about his Dallas co-stars and revealed that when contract re-negotiations were in full swing, everyone tried to get in front of the cameras (even when they were not needed) as much as possible to build up their ratings.

It got so bad that he and Bobby Ewing (played by Patrick Duffy) were patting each other on the back, shaking hands and sidling up to each other so frequently, they were told off!

He taught me loads of valuable tricks about how to upstage rivals on a show, many of which I still employ today.

What a fabulous man.

So far, I'm dead disappointed

Detective Sarah Lund takes aim

The new series of The Killing is proving to be a struggle.

Detective Sarah Lund (right) remains as compelling as ever, but this drama seems to be using too many of the same stock shots of the city at night we already saw in Danish political thriller Borgen.

Who cares about dreary party leaders rushing up and down dim corridors in government offices, vying to form a coalition government? The leading lady looks as if she hasn't slept for weeks, and seems to have aged ten years since Series 2.

The action takes place  in the dark, and the budget cuts the police are coping with seem to mean every office is lit with a single bulb.

So far, I'll award The Killing just six out of ten.

What makes celebrities happy?

Jamie Lee Curtis on the red carpet

To raise money for a new museum of British illustration in London, artists were tasked with turning the lists of what makes celebrities happy into pictures to be auctioned at Sotheby's next month.

Quentin Blake drew David Walliams swimming while his wife Lara Stone stands on the riverbank with a stopwatch, surrounded by spaghetti, pyjamas and their dog chewing on a shoe. 

Jamie Lee Curtis (right) picked clogs, cereal with milk, and a black T-shirt (by trendy Jil Sander, not just any old garment).

Jeremy Paxman chose Evelyn Waugh's Decline And Fall and Bollito Misto (an Italian dish of boiled meats), which sounds rather pretentious. 

Other celebs included Ruby Wax, Brian Eno and Florence Welch.

I wasn't honoured, but I doubt whether an illustration of my list would have fetched much.

Black pudding for breakfast, a walk in the rain, cotton M&S knickers, and pink turnips from my veg plot. I'm too cheap and cheerful.
