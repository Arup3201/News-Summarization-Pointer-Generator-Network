How training on his days off, a pep talk from Gary Neville and the stability of still living at home with mum and dad have turned Tyler Blackett into great hope at the heart of Manchester United’s defence 

Manchester United are ready to give Tyler Blackett a new contract.

The 20-year-old defender is currently earning just £2,000 a week at Old Trafford.

Blackett has been playing alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria this season — who both earn three times more per week than he does in a year.

Tyler Blackett is expected to be handed a new £50,000-a-week deal to extend his stay at Manchester United

It seems the Dutchman has been pleased with the defender, instructing the board to hand Blackett a new deal

Swansea (h) lost 2-1 - Sportsmail rating 6

Sunderland (a) 1-1 - 5

Burnley (a) 0-0 - 5.5

QPR (h) won 4-0 - 6.5

Leicester (a) lost 5-3 - 4.5

Everton (h) won 2-1 - 7 (came on at 70 mins)

But United boss Louis van Gaal has recommended to the board that the youngster is rewarded for his breakthrough into the first team with a deal representative of his new standing.

This means Blackett will jump up to somewhere near the £50,000-a-week level when he signs his new contract - that's a wage increase of 2,400 per cent.

United’s early-season injury crisis thrust Blackett in to the fray and Van Gaal believes he has a future at Old Trafford. 

The defender has generally equipped himself well in his six Premier League matches so far, although he was sent off in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester.
