Benjamin Netanyahu's wife drank excessive amounts of alcohol including three bottles of champagne a day, a former caretaker claimed in court.

Meni Naftali is suing the Israeli Prime Minister's office over allegations he was subjected to abusive language during his 20 months on the job.

In the witness box yesterday Naftali - who is seeking around $250,000 (£167,000) in damages - claimed Sara Netanyahu drank large amounts of alcohol. Mrs Netanyahu vehemently denies the claim.

The lawsuit, which was filed to the Jerusalem district labour court in Israel, states Naftali worked long hours and received 'unrestrained tongue-lashings from the prime minister's wife, Mrs. Sara Netanyahu'.

It adds: 'The vast majority of which were with the prime minister's knowledge.' 

In one instance, Naftali said Mrs Netanyahu called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton, according to the lawsuit.

In another, Naftali claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old. 

The cross-examination stage of the civil suit began yesterday.

Naftali told the court that when he initially met Mrs Netanyahu he did not know she drank 'crazy amounts' of alcohol.

'When I [later] became the house manager I found out that she drinks about three bottles of champagne a day,' the Times of Israel reported him saying. 

She also pocketed thousands of pounds of profits by recycling bottles purchased by the state, Naftali added in an earlier interview.

Mrs Netanyahu denied any abusive treatment and said any allegations were 'designed solely to sully' her reputation.

Cochavit Dolev-Netzach, representing the prime minister, confronted Naftali with allegations he had exhibited violent behaviour. Naftali denied the claim.

Further cross-examinations will include questioning Mrs Netanyahu and Ezra Saidoff, the deputy director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, Israeli daily Haaretz reported.

Guy Eliyahu and Emmanuel Sela, two former employees, are expected to act as witnesses to back up Naftali.

Mrs Netanyahu has received criticism since  the 1990s after it was alleged she squabbled with her staff.

Meanwhile, the government's state comptroller found in February that 'excessive' amounts of public funds were spent by Mr Netanyahu and his wife on food, furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home.

In a report by the official watchdog, it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of Caesarea averaged more than £1,370 a month in taxpayer's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there.
