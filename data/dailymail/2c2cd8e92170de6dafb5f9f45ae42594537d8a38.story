Wants her job back: 999 call handler Sue Heeney (pictured) claims she was sacked by Essex Police for being 'too jolly' after chuckling with a caller

A 999 operator who 'laughed and 
sniggered' throughout a call from a man reporting that a suspected drink-driver may have been involved in a hit-and-run has been sacked for gross misconduct.

Sue
 Heeney failed to 'grasp the seriousness of the situation' after joking 
with the caller when he made a mistake while giving her the registration
 of the car.

A disciplinary 
hearing was told that she 'got the giggles' and from then on 'failed to 
deal with the conversation in a sober and professional manner'.

She then graded the call with the incorrect heading 'suspicious circumstances' rather than 'non-stop road traffic collision'.

Miss
 Heeney, 38, who worked for Essex Police, had been told by the caller 
that a member of his own family may have been drink-driving.

But she did not 
take immediate steps to start an investigation or gather evidence that 
could have helped with the search for the suspect or victims.

It was only when a dispatcher realised the seriousness of the incident that more immediate action was taken.

The
 adjudicator said: 'It is extremely fortunate that the dispatcher who 
picked up this incident, reviewed and reassessed its nature and urgency 
and took effective action.'

The driver in question was found to have been involved in two collisions that evening and failed to stop at both of them.

One of the victims was a cyclist who was lucky to escape serious injury, it was heard.

Dismissing
 her for gross misconduct, the adjudicator ruled her actions 'could have
 potentially put lives at risk and adversely affected public 
confidence'.

The call, which
 was made on November 9 last year, became light-hearted when the caller,
 Paul Turner, struggled to recall the phonetic alphabet and suggested 'E
 as in Edward - I don’t know the proper one'.

Mother-of-two Miss Heeney corrected him that it was 'echo'.

A recording of the conversation reveals the caller laughs first, saying: 'I don’t know the proper one'.

After some giggling by both, the caller adds: 'You will be laughing all night now'.

Call centre: Essex Police headquarters in Springfield, Chelmsford, where Sue Heeney worked for four years

A
 letter from a detective inspector investigating the matter for Essex 
Police to Miss Heeney said: 'During the call, when receiving details 
from the caller, you started to laugh excessively at a mistake the 
caller had made and you continued to laugh and snigger throughout the 
call.'

Miss Heeney, of Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, says she chuckled with the caller to 'help him relax'.

She admitted mis-grading the call, but claimed the call was made more than three hours after the alleged incidents. 

Speaking after the hearing, she said: 'I was told I was being too jolly, laughing and happy on the phone.

'The
 grounds given were that I could have potentially put someone's life at 
risk and have a dangerous effect on public confidence.

'It
 was not at his expense - he said something funny and I laughed with 
him. It got him over his nerves and helped him to relax.'

Miss
 Heeney - who had worked at police HQ in Chelmsford, Essex, for four 
years before the incident - has now launched an appeal against her 
sacking.

'People need to 
know they are talking to a friendly human, not a robot, and you can 
build a rapport with them. Friendly and helpful is what the public 
wants.

'I've spoken to the caller since and he can't believe what has happened. There have been calls where I have literally saved someone's life.'

Paul Turner, who said it was an agonising decision to make the call, was shocked to learn Miss Heeney had been sacked.

He made the call, which involved a family member, after much deliberation over the impact it might have on his family relationship.

He
 said: 'I was very nervous about making the call but through her 
professionalism I was able to tell her everything that happened and all 
the details.

'If she had not been so good, or if I’d had someone blunt and rude, I would have hung up.'

A
 police spokesman said: 'Essex Police can confirm the civilian member of
 staff was dismissed from the force for gross misconduct following an 
allegation of negligence.

'An appeal against the dismissal has been made and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'
