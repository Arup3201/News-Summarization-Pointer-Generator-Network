The jobless would be given financial help to move house to find work under a plan to tackle long-term unemployment.

Anyone out of work for more than a year would be given cash by their local council to cover the costs of hiring a removals van or paying a deposit on a home.

The idea has been drawn up by the Centre for Social Justice think tank, set up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

People out of work for more than a year could be given financial help to move to areas where there are more jobs

Under the proposal, the long-term unemployed would be given money if they land a job which is more than 90 minutes’ commute from where they live.

The CSJ argues that people living on benefits in social housing are much less likely to be in work, and less likely to move to find a job.

The plan will draw comparisons with Norman Tebbit’s 1980s suggestion that the jobless should get on their bikes. In 2010, Mr Duncan Smith sparked a row by claiming the unemployed should ‘get on the bus’ and look for work.

He cited Merthyr Tydfil in Wales as somewhere where people had become ‘static’ and ‘didn’t know if they got on the bus an hour’s journey they’d be in Cardiff and they could look for the job there Critics condemned the message that people had to move to new areas in the hope of finding work.

Mr Duncan Smith set up the CSJ in 2004, after standing down as Tory leader. He stepped down after joining the Coalition government in 2010.

However, the CSJ insisted its scheme would be voluntary, and for many moving costs are a major barrier to taking up a job further afield.

In a report published today, The Journey To Work, the think tank said the process of relocation for work should be made ‘less financially burdensome’.

Current rules mean there is little incentive for the unemployed to look for work in other areas where the labour market is booming.

Norman Tebbit, who was Employment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher

Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'.

But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' never actually said anything of the sort.

The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981.

A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'.

The then Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.' 

The CSJ said: ‘We recommend the Government pilots a relocation scheme to help with the cost of moving home for work e.g. hiring a removal van or help with an up-front deposit.

‘This scheme would apply to any jobseeker who has been out of work and claiming Housing Benefit for 12 months or more and has received a concrete job offer which would require them to commute further than what is currently expected under existing regulations (90 minutes each way).’

The money could come from the Discretionary Housing Payment currently used by councils to help people claiming Housing Benefit and requiring more help with housing costs.

The CSJ calls for the plan to be piloted in areas of high unemployment.

‘To be clear, this is about supporting people to meet their ambition of moving, rather than forcing anyone to do so.

‘Of course this has to be done in a managed way to prevent significant population imbalances, which is why this recommendation is deliberately restricted to the long-term unemployed with a concrete job offer.’

A source at the Department for Work and Pensions said the plan was not being considered at present, but would be looked at by ministers.

Official figures show people living in social housing in England are more likely to live in financial poverty and less likely to be employed than home-owners or those living in the private rented sector.

Just 35 per cent of working-age social tenants are in full-time employment, compared to 65 per cent of private renters and 81 per cent of homeowners.

Tenants in social housing are also less likely to move, the CSJ said.

Some four in 10 social renters have been in the same house for at least 10 years, compared to fewer than one in 10 of private renters.

Phyllida Culpin, Director of Customer and Community Services at Yarlington Housing Group told the CSJ: ‘The cost of moving can be difficult for people to meet, particularly when they are moving to take up a job after a period of unemployment.

‘We offer assistance to residents with moving costs and we find that our support of £250 can make all the difference between moving or not.’
