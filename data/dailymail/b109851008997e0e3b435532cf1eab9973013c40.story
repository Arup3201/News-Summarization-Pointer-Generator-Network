Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard is clearly keen to celebrate her fine year on the tour as the 20-year-old put on the fancy dress for two nights out in a row this weekend.

Bouchard reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon and won her first WTA title this season before qualifying for the WTA Finals.

The world No 7 was in the party mood, posing in an army outfit with her twin sister Beatrice on Instagram, with the caption ‘reporting for duty’.

Friday night Bouchard and her mates dressed up as polar bears to head out for Halloween but the Canadian wasn’t sure it was scary enough, posting ‘Whyyyy are we polar bears?’.

The Wimbledon finalist would certainly have grabbed the spotlight in her outfits as the youngster has an army of dedicated fans across the world after her incredible rise up the rankings this season.

Bouchard started the year ranked at 32 but has shot up to world No 7 thanks to two Grand Slam semi-finals in Australia and at the French Open before reaching the final at Wimbledon.

Despite being thrashed 6-3, 6-0 by Petra Kvitova in the final at Wimbledon in just 55 minutes, the Canadian continued her fine form to reach her first WTA Finals in Singapore.

Perhaps the long campaign caught up on the 20-year-old star as she lost all three of her group matches without winning a set.

Bouchard and the rest of the WTA stars will have until the end of December to rest up before the season kicks off again at the turn of the year.
