It is thought laughing Yannick Ntesa, 25, sprayed the acid and made his getaway in a red BMW

A gang who laughed as they doused a woman in acid while she walked her six-year-old twins home from school have been jailed for a total of 44 years.

The attackers was heard laughing as the noxious liquid was sprayed at the screaming mother in front of her two boys outside Upton Cross Primary School in Upton Park, east London.

Speaking after the attack the woman, who suffered horrendous burns to her face and body, said: 'I saw a man approach me who was carrying something in a bottle.

'He threw it over me and after a few seconds it started burning. I was crying: "Please help me! Please help me!"'

It is thought Yannick Ntesa, 25, sprayed the acid and made his getaway in a red BMW with Abdul Motin, 28, and 31-year-old Ahad Miah.

The 44-year-old mother, from Plaistow, fled to a neighbour's home where water was poured over her burning clothes.

Some of the acid burnt her son's satchel while another mother also suffered minor injuries in the attack on March 24, 2011.

The victim was rushed to the Royal London Hospital and later transferred to a specialist burns unit in Chelmsford, Essex.

She suffered 16 per cent chemical burns and is still receiving medical treatment.

Following a six week trial at Blackfriars Crown Court a jury convicted Ntesa, Motno and Miah of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and throwing a corrosive fluid on another with intent.

Motin, from Stepney, east London, was jailed for 16 years.

Ntesa, from Paddington, and Miah, of no fixed address, were both jailed for 14 years.

No motive was given for the attack but Detective Inspector John Reynolds, of Newham CID, said: 'This was a truly shocking attack on a mother who had her two very young children with her at the time.

'It was only by chance that those children were not seriously injured. They did however suffer terrible shock from seeing their own mother so horrifically assaulted.

'The victim in this case is entirely innocent but will now spend the rest of her life having to adjust to the severe disfigurement inflicted on her.

'This sentencing demonstrates just how seriously the Met police and the courts treat such incidents. Those responsible have been bought to justice and we can only hope it brings some small comfort to the victim.'

Naomi Oni, 21, who worked at Stratford's Westfield Shopping Centre, spent a month in hospital after an acid attack in Dagenham, Essex, in the early hours of December 30 last year.

In April a 28-year-old woman, named as Tara, had acid squirted in her face after answering the door of her home in Romford, to a stranger.
