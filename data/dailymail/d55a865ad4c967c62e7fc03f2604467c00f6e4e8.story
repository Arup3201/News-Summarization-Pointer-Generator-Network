A British call centre has hit upon a novel solution to the problem of providing around-the-clock service - it has sent its staff to New Zealand.

Workers there man the phones in the daytime, which is night in the UK, meaning they are fresh and alert at all times.

Telephone-answering company Moneypenny cooked up the plan after managers realised that their employees would rather leave the country than work night shifts.

When workers at its base in Wrexham 
leave the office at 8pm, they hand over to their colleagues in Takapuna,
a suburb of Auckland, where it is then 8am.

And
when the British staff get back in the next morning, they take over 
from the 'night shift' workers, who are free to enjoy their evening.

Jess Edwards, 24, one of four workers who have relocated from Wales, said: 'It is a fantastic opportunity - I'm loving it.

'It was a bit strange to start with but it works very well - we go to work in the morning just as the staff in Wrexham are going home for the day.

'I am getting to see places I probably never would have the chance to see otherwise.

'I have visited Australia and both the North and South Islands of New Zealand and generally thrown myself into the experience.'

The staff are living together in a rented house, and work on a cycle of four days on, four days off to enable them to travel around their temporary home.

They are scheduled to return home soon, when they will be replaced by another set of four employees.

Moneypenny provides a service for companies who are unable to answer their phone calls, and has a diverse group of 6,000 clients.

When customers asked for a 24-hour service, the firm asked its employees to work nights but nearly all proved reluctant.

Out of 280 staff members, only four said they be willing to work after hours - but 40 were prepared to relocate abroad.

Bosses also realised that having all employees work in the daytime meant they would stay healthy and have a better attitude to work, meaning they would serve clients better.

Company founder Rachel Clacher said: 'We had looked at hiring staff to work overnight at our offices in Wrexham.

'But we weren't confident service levels could be maintained so would have never taken that risk.

'By working on the other side of the world we're now able to offer a truly 24-hour first-rate service, with bright, chirpy and wide-awake people.'
