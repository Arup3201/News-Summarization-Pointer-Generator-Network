Accused: Sheron Mancini was discovered with bars of gold in her bra, a jury was told

A woman told police she stashed two gold bars in her bra because she panicked when detectives hunting a £1million bullion heist gang arrested her, a court was told.

Sheron Mancini, 53, claimed she only found the two iphone size bars each weighing up to 1kg in her coat pocket after she and her boyfriend David Gale, 55, were stopped by Belgian police and arrested.

The court heard she told detectives that she had no knowledge of the bars despite being briefly frisked on her arrest earlier by motorcycle officers

She claimed it was only after being quizzed about a £1million bullion robbery and led to the cells that she discovered the bars in her coat. 

The jury heard how she then panicked and hid them in her underwear but when stripped searched by an officer tried to conceal them in her folded up bra placed in an examination box.

It was only when the officer picked up the bra to examine it that the bars fell out, it was claimed.

The Old Bailey previously heard that her partner Gale admitted being part of a gang who planned the heist of gold and silver bullion worth £1million from the back of a lorry in Belgium driven by gang member Brian Mulcahay.

TV’s The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers stepdad David Chatwood, 58, Mulcahay, 46, Matthew Middleton, 42, Gary Cummings, 51, and Stanley Rose, 75, have also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.

Trial: The Old Bailey heard how the trio were part of a plot to steal bullion worth £1million from a lorry and smuggle it into the UK

Mancini is accused of trying to smuggle 
the gold into the UK after the robbery which had been staged by the gang
on October 4 of last year.

A week after the robbery of the British registered lorry on a Belgian motorway, Mancini and Gale were pulled over by traffic police as they headed for a Channel port.

The Old Bailey jury had earlier heard 
the plot was 'doomed to failure' because some of the gang were being 
watched by British police and they were all soon rounded up.

The jury heard in interview with Belgian police, Mancini said: 'As I put my coat on, I felt there were two unidentified objects in my coat pocket.

'I immediately realised it was not right and immediately put these objects in my bra.

'I did not even look to see what they were.'

But she said she realised the gravity of the contents when she was searched, adding: 'It was then that I knew these items were in fact gold bars.

'I had to take off my bra and put it in a box.

'I had folded the bra in such a way that the items were not visible.

'As a female police officer picked up the bra, the gold bars fell out.'

But the Belgian police dismissed her story as 'implausible' with an inspector saying they thought the bars had been sitting in her bra from the beginning.

Mancini maintains she was telling the truth.

She is standing trial along with John Corley, 53, and father and son Andreas and Kayracos Nicolas, 50 and 30.

The trial continues.
