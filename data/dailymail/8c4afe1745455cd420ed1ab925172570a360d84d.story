Uruguay may believe Luis Suarez will be fit for their first World Cup game but a three-week turnaround is pushing it for a meniscus injury.

The meniscus is a piece of cartilage in the knee that acts as a cushion between the thigh and shin bones. From the sound of it, Suarez has a minor tear.

Normally there are two options to heal this: remove the damaged cartilage or try to repair it. Cutting out a section is a quicker procedure than repairing it, which can take several months. Suarez is likely to have had only some cartilage removed. It can take up to six weeks for a player to recover.

Once the 
swelling has gone down he will work in the pool and use an Alter-G 
treadmill to recover the knee movement without putting a lot of weight 
on it. He will probably use a Game Ready â€” a wrap that can compress and 
ice the knee for long periods at a time.

With
 muscle strains, physios have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves but 
recovering from surgery requires a combination of rest and careful 
management.
