She's long been a fan of all things equestrian but the Duchess of Cornwall tried her hand at a very different type of sport during a visit to Newcastle today.

The Duchess of Cornwall was at the local branch of cancer charity Maggie's, which offers emotional and practical support to people with cancer, when she was given a t'ai chi demonstration.

A martial art, t'ai chi is designed to improve mental wellbeing while also being useful as a means of self-defence.

After watching the t'ai chi demonstration, Camilla, 67, who was glamorous in a cream suit, toured the centre chatting to patients.

She was also introduced to architect Ted Cullinan, who told her that the centre was of particular importance to male cancer victims as 'northern men struggle to express their emotions'.

Later, while unveiling a new piece of art for the building, she said: 'I feel I have been in on this project from the very beginning.

'It’s wonderful and so uplifting and such a happy place. It brings everyone together, families and children, and they can all come and get the experience. Thank you so much for having me today.'

The Duchess also said she eventually hoped to see a Maggie’s centre in every major city across the country.

Maggie's, of which the Duchess became president in March 2008, opened its first branch in 1996 and now has 18 centres.

Last year the Newcastle centre, which is next to the Freeman Hospital, had more than 16,000 visits, of which 6,000 were men.

'I’m honoured to have welcomed Her Royal Highness to Maggie’s Newcastle,' said Laura Lee, chief executive of Maggie’s afterwards.

'We’re incredibly grateful for her continued support and the difference it makes to those who visit and work in our centres.'

After the visit to the cancer centre,  the Duchess travelled on to Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children’s Books.

It is the only place in the UK dedicated to the art of children’s books and receives over 80,000 visitors a year.

There Camilla met the staff and children who use the museum and was shown round the various spaces and exhibitions.

The Duchess rounded off her visit to the North East by being shown round the Laing Art Gallery, where she was shown a number of previously unseen paintings, including one of herself.

Trust me, I'm a (royal) doctor! Prince Charles tries his hand at 'surgery' during tour of London hospital

Training: He also met trainee surgeons working at the brand new Surgical Innovation Centre

He's famous for his love of technology but Prince Charles found himself getting a bit closer to the action than he bargained for this morning.

The royal, 66, was touring the brand new Surgical Innovation Centre at St. Mary's Hospital in London when he was invited to try his hand at 'surgery'.

Using specialist 3D technology, the centre replicates the challenges surgeons face during operations, although Charles didn't quite have the light hands required.

Instead, the first-in-line to the throne gamely waggled a few levers in a bid to move marbles around a bowl - a task designed to improve dexterity.

Afterwards, he was shown an impressively lifelike recreation of the human body, as well as getting a closer look at trainee surgeons practising their skills using a blow-up operating table.

He was also shown the Da Vinci robot, an incredible piece of equipment which can perform advanced ear, nose and throat surgery.

The newly opened centre specialises in general, weight-loss and breast surgery as well as gastroenterological and urology cases.

It is connected to the Health Innovation Exchange studio which sees doctors and scientists work on innovative cures and other novel treatments.

It was to this that the Prince of Wales went next, where he was shown  a smartphone app to help children with asthma, a design intervention to improve patient cancer care and a design-led solution to improve uptake in bowel cancer screening.

Innovative: Cutting edge treatments on show included a smartphone app designed to help asthmatic children

Cheerful: Charles, who has long been fascinated by technology, was on top form
