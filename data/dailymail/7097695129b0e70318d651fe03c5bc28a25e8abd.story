The parents of four-year-old girl have spoken of their heartbreak after she died just 11 days after being diagnosed with leukaemia.

Alexia McArthur’s parents Gaz McArthur and Jade Ellerby were told there was nothing more doctors could do as the disease took hold of their daughter's body.

Ms Ellerby, 25, said: ‘I was laid on the bed with her singing her favourite One Direction songs. I had my arms around her and felt her take her last breath.’

Alexia McArthur, four, died just 11 days after being diagnosed with aggressive leukaemia. She had chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant but doctors could not save her

Mr McArthur, 28, added: ‘You couldn’t even call her one in a million - you would need a much bigger number. She was a little star. She touched everyone.’

Alexia, from Kimberworth Park, Rotherham, was taken ill after going to the cinema with her parents.

The next morning, she was sent by her GP to Rotherham Hospital where staff suspected leukaemia and transferred her to Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

After more tests Alexia was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - a fast growing blood cancer which affects 350 children a year in the UK.

She had treatment including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant but lost her battle for life last Friday.

Ms Ellerby said: ‘After we’d been to the pictures we noticed Alexia had lost her colour and looked yellowish. Since then our world has been turned upside down.

Alexia was diagnosed after her parents noticed she had turned 'yellowish'. Her cancer was too aggressive to be successfully treated

‘It’s happened so quickly. Last Tuesday she took a turn for the worse. She was just staring into the corner of the room. I said “Can you see mummy?” and she said “no”.’

Alexia was moved to intensive care but doctors realised during an MRI scan that no treatment would save the youngster.

Ms Ellerby said: ‘She went for the scan and never woke up. Basically it was just a matter of time.

‘They said we could have as long as we wanted but she would either go in her own time or we could make the decision to switch off the machine.

‘We had to decide whether we wanted to switch off the machine. It was the hardest thing ever but we didn’t want her to suffer any more.

‘We put her in her pyjamas and stopped with her until the next morning. She looked so peaceful and comfortable.’

More than 50 relatives and friends were at the hospital when Alexia died, including her older sister Kenzie, and the family received thousands of messages of support and sympathy.

Ms Ellerby, 25, said: 'I was laid on the bed with her singing her favourite One Direction songs. I had my arms around her and felt her take her last breath'

Mr McAurthur said: ‘We’re so grateful to the hospital staff for all they did and to everyone for their support. It’s been overwhelming.’

Ms Ellerby added: ‘Alexia was an adult in a kid’s body, she acted so grown up and people said she was a mini version of me.

‘There are lots of happy memories. She always wanted a baby brother. She was sitting in the back of the car one day and she asked which one of us was going to get her a brother.

‘Words can’t describe how much she meant to us or how beautiful she was.’

Fundraising events planned for the Children’s Hospital already include a skydive, a bike ride, a fun run and a music gig.

Family friend Steven Richardson said: ‘Alexia’s story is spreading rapidly and we’ve had messages from all over the UK and now the USA. There have been some very generous donations.’

Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells.

Acute leukaemia is that which progresses rapidly and aggressively.

Lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes - the white blood cells that fight viral infections.

Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and repeated infections.

It affects about 650 people a year in the UK and is the most common type of cancer in children.

Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it.

About 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15.

The outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured.

The outlook for adults with the disease is less good - only 40 per cent are completely cured.
