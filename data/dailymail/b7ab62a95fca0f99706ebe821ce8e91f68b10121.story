Juventus have been told to stump up £16million if they want to sign Galatasaray playmaker Wesley Sneijder.

According to Italian publication Tuttosport, the Serie A leaders are interested in a move for the Holland international as they look to strengthen their midfield options.

The 30-year-old was linked with a move to Premier League outfit Southampton last month after looking for a move away from the Turkish club.

Sneijder, who joined Galatasaray in January 2013, has previous experience of playing in Serie A, where he enjoyed a trophy-laden three and a half years at Inter Milan.

Over in Spain, the media focus is firmly on giants Real Madrid and Barcelona's La Liga defeats on Sunday.

Real's 2-1 loss at rivals Valencia saw Carlo Ancelotti's side lose for the first time since August.

With their 22-game winning streak ended, Marca recognises this by praising Valencia boss Nuno for his side overcoming Real with 'intensity and skill'.

Los Blancos' defeat meant Barcelona had the opportunity to replace their eternal enemy at the top of the table if they could win at Real Sociedad.

The Nou Camp outfit however, lost 1-0 to David Moyes' side with the Catalan press heavily critical of manager Luis Enrique.

Headlined with 'What a shame!' Mundo Deportivo  focus on Enrique's team selection which saw star talisman Lionel Messi, as well as Neymar, Gerard Pique and Daniel Alves, all start on the bench.

Finally over in France, L'Equipe lead with the headline 'A monumental feat!' after the shock news that Ligue 1 leaders Marseille were dumped out of the French Cup by fourth-tier side Grenoble on Sunday.

The minnows came from behind three times to force the game into extra-time and penalties before winning the shootout 5-4 as Florian Thauvin missed the decisive kick for Marseille.
