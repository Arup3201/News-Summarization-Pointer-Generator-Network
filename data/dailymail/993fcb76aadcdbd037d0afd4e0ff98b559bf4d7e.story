The Liberal Democrats are on course to lose a swathe of seats to their Conservative coalition partners at next year’s general election, according to a major new series of polls.

A study across 17 crucial Tory-Lib Dem marginal constituencies found that the Lib Dem vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party’s MPs are set to lose to Tory challengers.

The Lib Dems are braced to lose more seats to Labour in the north of the country, where their vote has also slumped since 2010.

The findings will pile pressure on Nick Clegg, who has attempted to reassure MPs and activists that despite a grim national picture, the Lib Dems are holding up in those seats where they are incumbent, particularly where the Conservatives are the main opposition.

They will also embolden senior Tories who want to kick the Lib Dems while they are down. Lib Dem MPs on the left of the party claim they have been approached by members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers seeking allies for a plot to try to break up the coalition.

Senior Conservatives on the committee, said to be planning to stage a vote on whether the coalition parties should go their separate ways, apparently believe the move would be more credible if it was backed by some Lib Dems too.

Research by pollster Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman, provided the first comprehensive picture of how the two coalition parties are faring in the marginal seats where they chiefly compete against each other.

The study across 17 Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats found that the vote share for David Cameron’s party was down eight points since 2010 to 33 per cent, but the Lib Dems were down 15 per cent to 28 per cent.

The polls found an overall 3.5 per cent swing from the Lib Dems to their coalition partners in the seats since 2010, enough for the Conservatives to unseat as many as 15 Lib Dem MPs if this were to happen across the board at the general election next May.

However, there were signs of big regional variations. Swings ranged from one per cent Lib Dem to the Conservatives in Newton Abbot in Devon to 4.5 per cent from Conservatives to Lib Dems in Sutton and Cheam in south London.

Lord Ashcroft noted that the Lib Dems are ‘famously tenacious local campaigners’ whose activists have a record of ‘incessant leaflet mongering’.

He said the polling ‘suggests that in some places Nick Clegg’s party may indeed defy the national trend’ but ‘according to this snapshot the party risks losing a dozen or more seats to the Conservatives’.

Across the 17 seats, six of which are held by the Conservatives and 11 by Mr Clegg’s party, the poll put the Tories on 33% (-8), Lib Dems on 28% (-15), Ukip 18% (+14) and Labour on 14% (+5).

The Tories would hold their six marginal seats included in the survey - Camborne and Redruth, Harrogate and Knaresborough, Newton Abbot, Oxford West and Abingdon, Truro and Falmouth, and Watford.

Among the 11 Lib Dem seats polled, seven would be won by the Tories: Solihull, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Wells, St Austell and Newquay, Somerton and Frome, St Ives, and Chippenham.  

MPs whose seats would be lost include Duncan Hames, Annette Brooke, Lorely Burt, David Heath, Andrew George, Stephen Gilbert and Tessa Munt.

The Lib Dems would hold three - Sutton and Cheam, Cheadle, and Eastleigh - while the polling resulted in a dead heat in North Cornwall.

Across the 17 seats Ukip’s vote share ranged from 11 per cent in Oxford West and Abingdon to 26 per cent in Camborne and Redruth, with just over one in six 2010 Conservative voters saying they would vote for Nigel Farage’s party.

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Ukip are not just a problem for the Tories. Those who voted Lib Dem at the last election were as likely to say they would switch to Ukip (13%) as to say they would switch to Labour (13%). A further 11% said they intended to vote Conservative.  

‘The party is literally losing votes right, left and centre.

‘The Lib Dems are in their current position not because of anything Nick Clegg himself has done or not done, but because his party is in government with the Conservatives - a decision endorsed by the whole party through its exhaustive processes of internal democracy.

‘The centre-right coalition already has a left-wing alternative, led by Ed Miliband. Former Lib Dem voters who switched because they were dismayed that the party entered office with the Tories would only consider coming back if the party promised not to make the same decision in 2015, no matter what the election result.

‘Such a declaration is surely unthinkable, or ought to be for a party that wants to have any influence on the nation’s affairs.’

 Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable’s closest ally, Lord Oakeshott, quit the Lib Dems after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in Lib Dem seats to show the party would do better without Mr Clegg.

The former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, who leaked the poll findings in a botched coup attempt against Mr Clegg, said the Deputy Prime Minister had robbed the party of its ‘roots, principles and values’.
