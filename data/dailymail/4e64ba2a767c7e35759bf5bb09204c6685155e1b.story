The number of victims coming forward with allegations of historical child abuse could reach ‘many tens of thousands’, an MP has warned.

John Mann said the state ‘can't deal with’ the volume of claims that are being made.

The Labour MP for Bassetlaw suggested a national institute needed to be created to handle the complaints.

John Mann, MP, has said the state will not be able to cope with the number of people coming forward with historic child sex abuse claims while Theresa May, right, is still considering the make-up of the body

A Government inquiry has been set-up to investigate historic child abuse following claims of a VIP paedophile ring operating in Westminster in the 1980s.

But it has been mired in uncertainty with two candidates for chair - former judge Baroness Butler-Sloss and ex-Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf - having to stand aside over their establishment links.

Mr Mann said there had been too much emphasis on individuals. ‘It's not just about who chairs an inquiry, it's about what the remit of an inquiry should be, who else should be sat on that inquiry, who should be advising it,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘As an example, one of the things that survivors' groups are calling for in the discussions I've had with them is for government to set up a national institute to take forward this work on what you do with all these people coming forward.

‘Probably, it's going to be many tens of thousands of people across the country. The state can't deal with the numbers of people coming forward.

‘The police and social services cannot cope with the volume that's there, even now. And we're hardly at the beginning of people coming forward.’

Mr Mann, who has given a dossier of allegations of historical abuse to Scotland Yard, added: ‘I'm getting vast numbers of people, including my constituents, coming forward making allegations. 

'Many of those people came forward in the past and weren't listened to or weren't believed.

‘And that's a key part of the problem. 

'What do you do with people making allegations against people, and nothing was done in the past, when the people they're making allegations against in some cases are dead?’

The historic child abuse inquiry panel has started work but still has no-one to lead it.

Home Secretary Theresa May, who set up the inquiry, is still considering its format and has told the current panel it might be disbanded.

Dozens of survivors have called for the Government to scrap the current inquiry and replace it with a more powerful body.
