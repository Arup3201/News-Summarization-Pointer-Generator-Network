Households are throwing away a million tons of untouched food each year, figures show.

This means around one quarter of our ‘avoidable’ food waste has not even been opened after it was bought.

Confusion over best-before labelling, ‘buy one get one free’ supermarket offers and the decline of basic cooking skills are all blamed for the ‘quite staggering’ figures from by the Government’s waste advisory body.

Experts also warn that we are victims 
of a culture in which we feel we haven’t provided properly for our 
family unless they leave some food on their plate.

The
 figures, compiled by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) 
from two studies involving almost 3,000 households around the UK, show 
that Britons throw away 7million tons of food waste a year.

While
 some of this, such as bones, shells and tea bags, is unavoidable, some 
4.2million tons is ‘avoidable waste’ – food that could have been eaten. 
This is enough to provide six meals a week for the average family – and 
save them £700 a year.

Shockingly, a quarter of this needless waste is thrown away whole or in unopened packaging.

Potatoes make up almost a quarter of this untouched food waste, with some 230,000 tons going straight in the bin.

To blame: Offers in supermarkets such as 'buy one get one free' and a decline of cooking skills are behind the rising food waste mountain

Salads in unopened bags and other 
fresh vegetables account for 260,000 tons and unwrapped and whole fresh 
fruit some 240,000 tons.

Some 10,000 tons of apples, 46,000 tons of carrots and one in every ten bananas are thrown away untouched.

The
 research also shows that more than 60 per cent of the tomatoes and 
mushrooms that are binned are still whole. The report comes after a 
study by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers last year concluded 
that up to half of the food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin.

Experts
 at the institution said that with the shift away from small shops to 
large-scale supermarkets, we have lost the sense of value of food.

And just last month, several EU countries blamed confusion over best-before dates for millions of tons of food waste a year.

Unlike
 use-by dates, which are used to denote the safety of meat and other 
foods that spoil quickly, best-before dates are usually just a mark of 
food quality such as flavour and texture.

But it means that dried pasta, flour, tinned goods and other  products with a long shelf life are being binned unnecessarily. Wrap found that almost half of the 4.2million tons of avoidable waste was binned because it was ‘not used  in time’. Other reasons given for binning food include people cooking too much.

Sue Baic, of the British Dietetic Association, said that she is ‘always amazed’ at how people struggle to turn leftovers into a meal.

Supermarket ‘buy one, get one free’ offers are also blamed as they tempt shoppers into buying more than they need.

Colin Brown, one of the authors last year’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers report, said such offers lead to food being binned because people find eating the same thing monotonous.

Emma Marsh, a food waste prevention manager at Wrap, described the figures as ‘quite staggering’.

She said: ‘We all have our own reason for why food gets thrown away at home, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.

‘We want to be able to get people to look at the huge volume of food and drink that’s ending up in the bin and consider one thing they might do differently to make sure food gets tasted, not wasted.’
