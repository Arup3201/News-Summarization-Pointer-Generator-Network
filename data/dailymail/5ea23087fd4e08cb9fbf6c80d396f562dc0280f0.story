A registered sex offender and convicted criminal is back behind bars after his girlfriend - terrified for her safety and for her baby - slipped a convenience store clerk a note on Saturday afternoon begging him for help.

Mark Valuckas, 36, of Tacoma, Washington, has an extensive criminal record which includes sexual assault, kidnapping, and weapons and drugs charges.

His girlfriend, who hasn’t been named, told police that Valuckas had a history of being abusive to her and had even threatened to hurt her child.

Registered sex offender and convicted criminal Mark Valuckas, 36, of Tacoma, Washington, is back behind bars after his girlfriend slipped a convenience store clerk a note on Saturday afternoon begging for help

She claims that Valuckas - who is 4 feet, 3 inches tall - hit her on the side of her head with a baseball bat during an argument on Saturday then held a pocket knife to her throat and threatened to kill her.

Valuckas then allegedly told her to take a ride with him so he could calm down, reports The News Tribune.

The woman was so frightened for her safety that when he told her to go inside and pay at an ARCO gas station in Tacoma, Washington, she saw her chance to get help.

Bruce Dean, who was working at the store, told KIRO that he was approached by the frightened woman who begged him for a pen and paper and then handed him a note. 

The woman was so frightened for her safety that when she went pay at this ARCO gas station in Tacoma, Washington, she begged the staff to call 911

The note 
read, ‘Can you call 911,’ then she listed her license plate number. The 
next line said ‘DV’ for domestic violence, and finally: ‘Baby in car.’

As the woman headed back to the car, Dean called 911 and gave them the license plate number.

Shortly
 afterwards a Pierce County sheriff's deputy caught up with the vehicle 
and found that Valuckas had a baseball bat and a knife with him.

According to court records, the woman also told police that Valuckas had allegedly stabbed her left hand, burned her 
with a cigarette and repeatedly punched her, during an incident last Thursday.

Prosecutors
 have charged Valuckas with two counts of second-degree assault and 
felony harassment.

Gas station clerk Bruce Dean, right, recognized Valuckas, left, several days after the incident because the convicted criminal is shorter than five foot and therefore has a distinctive appearance

Superior Court Judge Phil Sorensen ordered Valuckas 
jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail. The baby was unharmed in the incident.

Dean spoke to KIRO on Tuesday and was able to confirm that Valuckas, who is distinctive because of his short height, was the man involved in Saturday’s incident.

When Dean was told about the events that had resulted in the woman begging him for help he said he was glad to have helped.

Valuckas, who has been known to use aliases including Mark Valucus and Markiss Valuckas, appears on the sex offender registry following a kidnapping conviction in 2005. He has served two spells in the Washington County Prison system between 2005 and 2006, and then between 2010 and 2013.
