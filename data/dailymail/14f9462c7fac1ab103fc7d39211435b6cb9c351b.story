Mauricio Pochettino is not scared to drop his star players from the north London derby, and has told his squad that a good performance against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup could earn them a place against Arsenal on Saturday.

This will come as a wake-up call to Tottenham's under-achieving senior players, as Pochettino opens the door for fringe and youth squad members to make the starting eleven in one of Spurs' biggest games of the season.

Speaking to press in the build-up to Wednesday night's Capital One Cup match against Nottingham Forest, Pochettino said: 'We have 25 or 26 players and they are all in the squad.

'If I decide you play then you play, but the name is nothing for me when I pick my team. Every day, they fight for their places.

'When I pick the best players for each game, I analyse the last performance. I have no problem to change, I have no problem to pick different players in different competitions or if it's not a good moment - if you need to change, you change.'

Tottenham have endured a difficult start to the season, winning two, losing two and drawing one on their way to ninth position. 

Last weekend's loss to West Brom stretched Spurs' winless streak to four matches in all competitions, and they have a lot to prove when they face a Forest team flying high, unbeaten, at the top of the Championship.
