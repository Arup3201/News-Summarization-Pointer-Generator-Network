An alleged brothel is in operation a short distance from the council children's welfare department at the centre of the Baby P scandal.

Police are investigating the site after residents of Cumberland Road in north London complained about men loitering in the street before being allowed into the flat.

The property is close to the building housing Haringey Council’s adult, culture and community services and children and young people’s services departments.

Haringey social workers failed to save the life of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.

Graffiti was spray-painted outside the property in an apparent effort to shame those running the brothel, which is close to the building housing Haringey Council’s  children and young people’s services departments

Furore: Residents of Cumberland Road in north London have complained about men loitering in the street before being allowed into the flat

Peter Connelly, who was just 17 months old when he died in 2007. Haringey Council was heavily criticised after it emerged that social workers had visited the family a number of times before he died

The toddler died in 2007 after suffering months of abuse from his mother, her boyfriend and his brother, even though the family had been seen on 60 occasions by social workers, health workers and others.

Tony McLoughlin, a father-of-two who lives on the street, told the Evening Standard: 'It’s men banging on the wrong doors, saying: "I’m here for my appointment, my massage".'

'There’s almost a queue of men outside.

'On Sunday the kids were out playing and there was a guy just stood there.'

The word 'brothel' was spray-painted outside the property in an apparent effort to shame those running it.

It was also reported that an 83-year-old woman opened the door to a man who wanted a massage.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers from Woodside Safer Neighbourhoods Team (SNT) became aware of a brothel in Cumberland Road.

'After receiving the information they visited the address and spoke with two female occupants, to check on their welfare.

'Details of those present were taken and relevant enquires were made.

'The landlord of the premises has now been located and informed that the property was being used as a brothel. He has been made aware of the offence under Section 34 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 of letting premises for use as a brothel.

'Officers are continuing to work with the landlord and Haringey Council to formulate a long-term solution.'

Anger: The toodler's death caused  outrage, not only because of the horrific nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the social services. Pictured, tributes laid in tribute at Islington Crematorium

Sergeant Jon Bosustow, from Woodside SNT, said: 'My team and I will continue to take immediate action to close brothels wherever we find them on our ward.'

Local constable Jack Morris e-mailed residents and said the ladies working there are not being held captive and that closing the alleged brothel is their priority.

A Haringey council spokeswoman said: 'We share residents concerns about this property. Local councillors first raised this issue with police in July and are continuing to press police to take action. 

'Powers to close suspected brothels lie with the police.'

Baby P's Mother Tracey Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009, with a minimum five-year tariff, for causing or allowing the toddler’s death, along with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted of the same offence.

She was let out in October following a second Parole Board review of her case, a move that even her own father condemned.

Peter's death caused widespread outrage, not only because of the horrific nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the social services which were supposed to ensure his wellbeing.

Sharon Shoesmith, the head of Haringey's children's services during the scandal, was sacked after a damning report into the death.

However, Shoesmith won an unfair dismissal case in October and was awarded a payout of £679,452.
