Torture permanently damages a human's normal perception of discomfort, scientists have warned.

Ex-prisoners of war (POWs), continue to 
suffer from 'dysfunctional pain perception and regulation', likely as a 
result of their torture, according to Israeli researchers.

They found the ex-soldiers' bodies do not recover from immediate pain as quickly as people who have not been tortured and that they also feel pain more acutely if it is reoccurring.

A team of scientists studied the long-term effects of torture on the human pain system by looking at a group of Israeli soldiers 40 years after they were captured.

The soldiers who took part in the study were seized during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and were subjected to brutal torture in Egypt and Syria.

Held alone in tiny, filthy spaces for weeks or months, sometimes handcuffed and blindfolded, they suffered severe beatings, burns, electric shocks and starvation, and rather than receiving treatment, additional torture was inflicted on existing wounds.

Now research by Professor Ruth Defrin of the Department of Physical Therapy in the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, shows that ex POWs continue to suffer from dysfunctional pain perception and regulation, probably as a result of their bad treatment decades ago.

The study, which was conducted in 
collaboration with Professor Zahava Solomon and Professor Karni Ginzburg
 of the university's Bob Shapell School of Social Work and Professor 
Mario Mikulincer of the School of Psychology at the Interdisciplinary 
Centre, Herzliya, was published in the European Journal of Pain.

'The human body's pain system can either inhibit or excite pain. It's two sides of the same coin, said Professor Defrin.

'Usually, when it does more of one, it does less of the other, but in Israeli ex POWs, torture appears to have caused dysfunction in both directions. Our findings emphasise that tissue damage can have long-term systemic effects and needs to be treated immediately.'

The study focused on 104 combat veterans of the Yom Kippur War, 60 of whom were taken prisoner during the war, and 44 of whom were not.

All participants of the study were put through a battery of psychophysical pain tests, which included applying a heating device to one arm, submerging the other arm in a hot water bath and pressing a nylon fibre into a middle finger, and then filled out psychological questionnaires.

The researchers believe non-physical torture - such as solitary confinement, illustrated - may have also contributed to the ex POWs' chronic pain

The ex POWs exhibited diminished pain 
inhibitionÂ  - the degree to which the body eases one pain in response to
 another - and heightened pain excitation, which is the degree to which 
repeated exposure to the same sensation heightens the resulting pain.

Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that the torture survivors' bodies now regulate pain in a dysfunctional way.

It is not entirely clear whether the dysfunction is the result of years of chronic pain or of the original torture itself, but the ex POWs exhibited worse pain regulation than the non POW chronic pain sufferers in the study.

A statistical analysis of the test data also suggested that being tortured had a direct effect on their ability to regulate pain.

The researchers believe non-physical torture may have also contributed to the ex POWs' chronic pain.

Among other forms of oppression and humiliation, the ex POWs were not allowed to use the toilet, were cursed at and threatened, told demoralising misinformation about their loved ones and were exposed to mock executions.

In the later stages of captivity, most of the POWs were transferred to a group cell, where social isolation was replaced by intense friction, crowding and loss of privacy.

'We think psychological torture also affects the physiological pain system,' says Professor Defrin.

'We still have to fully analyse the data, but preliminary analysis suggests there is a connection,' she added.
