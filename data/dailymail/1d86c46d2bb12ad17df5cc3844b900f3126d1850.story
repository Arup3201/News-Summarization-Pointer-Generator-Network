Some politicians from New York and New England are using the Super Bowl as an opportunity to make a point about their closest causes, or bond with their constituents.

New York congressman Gregory Meeks is using it to make some serious cash.

Mr Meeks has held pricey Super Bowl parties in the past, and up until two weeks ago, his fundraising agency was still selling $5,000 tickets to his event this year.

Now, after the news of the event spread, the details of the party have become harder to come by.

Because the NFL allows elected officials to buy tickets to the big game at face value, Mr Meeks could easily purchase a number of tickets for a significantly cheaper rate than his constituents, and donors.

While congressmen like Mr Meeks can buy tickets for $800, $900, or $1,200, members of the public are spending up to $2,000 on tickets through websites like StubHub.

When asked by The New York Post, Mr Meeks would not say if his costly fundraising event was still being held, and would not even say if he was watching the game in New York or at the stadium in Indiana.

In 2010, when no New York team was even playing in the Super Bowl, Mr Meeks held a similar $5,000-per-ticket party in Miami for the game. 

The seven-term congressman, who 
represents a relatively small area in the New York borough of Queens, 
has already raised $369,118 during this election cycle. That total ranks
him number 404 of the 539 members of congress in terms of how much 
money they have raised since 2011.

This is not the first time that Mr Meeks' financial dealings have caused some questions: he was investigated by the House ethics committee in 2010 because of a questionable loan that a donor gave him.

He is also thought to have received a number of financial benefits because of his congressional status, including a cut-rate cost on his home and numerous luxury vacations for him and his wife that were paid for by donors.

Mr Meeks also had a long-standing 
business relationship with R. Allen Stanford, the Ponzi-schemer whose 
trial is currently underway.

Making good use of the game: Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg filmed an ad together advocating gun control

Unlike Mr Meeks, most New York politicians have been very forthcoming about their Super Bowl plans.

Governor Andrew Cuomo will be watching the game in New York, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg will cheering for the Giants from inside the Indiana stadium.

Mr Bloomberg also filmed a commercial with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, which will air regionally during the game, to bring attention to their fight against the illegal sale of guns.
