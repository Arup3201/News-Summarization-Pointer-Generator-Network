Changes: A young boy enjoys a carton of Ribena, which is one of several drinks to have sugar reduced to protect teeth and curb obesity

Soft drinks like Lucozade, Ribena and Irn-Bru are to have their sugar content slashed by up ten per cent in an admission they should not have been so sweet in the first place.

The reduction has been agreed by makers to protect the teeth of children and quell the 'rising tide of obesity' in Britain, the Government has said.

At the moment a 500ml bottle of Ribena contains as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar while a can of Irn-Bru has more than half a dozen.

But Coca Coca Cola told MailOnline today they will not 
reduce the seven teaspoons in a 330ml can of their signature drink.

They say they have lots of low calorie alternatives and have cut levels in its 
Fanta, Lilt and Oasis brands.

Campaigners are still unimpressed, as despite sugar levels being reduced, most of these soft drinks drinks will still get a Foot Standards Agency red light, because they contain more than 6.3g of sugar per 100ml of liquid. 

Charlie Powell of the Children's Food Campaign pressure group said: 'So they are swapping one red light for another: not exactly impressive.'

It came as the public health minister Anna Soubry said that you can spot poor Britons because they are usually overweight.

A culture of unhealthy TV dinners and junk food has eroded family life and that many homes no longer even have a dining table, the Tory MP added.

Today GlaxoSmithKilne says the sugar in the Ribena ready-to-drink line and Lucozade Energy will be cut by 'up to 10 per cent', while AG Barr will reduce the calorie content across its drinks range, which includes Irn-Bru, by five per cent.

The J20 brand has also announced it is to launch two flavours in a new 
slimline can which will represent a 10 per cent calorie reduction compared with 
its standard 275ml bottle, while Co-operative Food will look at 
controlling calories in popular product lines and Burton's Biscuits will
offer more portion control packs and review its recipes.

Anna Soubry welcomed the pledges as England has some of the highest obesity rates in the developed world, with 60 per cent of adults and one third of 10 and 11-year-olds being overweight or obese.

The Government has launched its Responsibility Deal calorie reduction pledge to encourage businesses and other organisations to help consumers consume less sugar.

'Being overweight and not eating well is bad for our health. To reverse the rising tide of obesity we have challenged the nation to reduce our calorie intake by five billion calories a day. On average that's just 100 calories less a day per person,' Ms Soubry said.

Reduction: Lucozade energy will have sugar cut by 10% and Irn-Bru by 5% in changes that raise serious questions about why they were so sweet in the first place

No change: But Coca Cola's signature drink will not have its sugar levels reduced, as thegiant says it has cut it in others and has many low-calorie alternatives

'Today's announcement will cut the calories and sugar by up to 10% in leading brands like Lucozade and Ribena. Through the Responsibility Deal we are already achieving real progress in helping people reduce the calories and salt in their diet. Overall, more than 480 companies including many leading high street brands have signed up to the Responsibility Deal.

Pleased: Public health minister Anna Soubry says that the decision to slash sugar will benefit Britain

'All of the major supermarkets have now committed to removing artificial trans fats, and over 70% of fast food and takeaway meals sold on the high street have calories clearly labelled, but more needs to be done.

'We are encouraged by the extra businesses which have signed up today but I want to see even more progress. All in the food industry have a part to play and I now expect companies which are not yet taking action to come forward and make pledges.'

Last year Coca Cola signed up to the Government’s calorie reduction pledge to cut calories from sparkling soft drinks.

'We recognise obesity is a serious public health issue, which is why we help people make informed choices about our products and encourage them to lead active lifestyles. We will continue to work in in partnership with others to help address the challenge of obesity,' a Coca Cola spokesman said.

Responsibility Deal Food Network chairwoman Dr Susan Jebb said: "I'm pleased to see the soft drinks manufacturers like GSK, AG Barr and Britvic join Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to make some very real commitments to help consumers cut down on their calories as they take control of their weight.

'I hope we will now see others, including the out of home sector, taking a careful look at how they can build on this and come to the table with new commitments to encourage their customers choose smaller portions and swap to lower calorie options.'

Food and Drink Federation director general Melanie Leech said: "We commend these businesses for joining existing pledge signatories in a shared commitment to support the calorie reduction challenge issued to the nation by ministers last year. Of the 31 pledge signatories, 15 are manufacturers, demonstrating our sector's willingness to engage and deliver improved public health outcomes under the deal.

'On calorie reduction, and the other pledges already issued by the Food Network, we urge the Department of Health to continue its efforts to broaden engagement and bring in new companies to work with those of our members, and others, who have already made substantial commitments through the Responsibility Deal.'

British Soft Drinks Association director general Gavin Partington said: "We welcome the commitments made by leading soft drinks producers. Our industry has been taking steps to reduce the calorie content of our drinks for many years now, and currently more than 60% of all soft drinks contain no added sugar.'

The eight new drink and food manufacturers, supermarket and catering companies to have signed up to the pledge join 23 others including Mars and Tesco.
