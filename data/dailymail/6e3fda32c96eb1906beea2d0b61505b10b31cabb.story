Jeremy Clarkson was one of the thousands of people who turned out to watch the traditional Boxing Day hunt as it rode through his farmland in Oxfordshire earlier today.

The Heythrop Hunt, which makes its way through Chipping Norton, also takes in land belonging to the Top Gear presenter, which he has renamed Diddly Squat farm.

Earlier today, Mr Clarkson could be seen wrapped up in a scarf and heavy coat and wearing boots as he and two friends awaited the arrival of the horses, their riders and the dogs on his farm.

The BBC host has been a keen supporter of the hunt, which is said to be popular among members of the Chipping Norton set - an influential group of MPs and media professionals who live close to the Oxfordshire market town.

Earlier this year, Mr Clarkson submitted a planning application to redevelop the main house into a mansion on the farmland, where the hunt rode by earlier today.

The farm is just a few miles away from his country home on the outskirts of Chipping Norton.

Mr Clarkson bought the farmhouse in Chipping Norton in 2009 with plans to own quad bikes and grow his own food

The 54-year-old had plans to demolish the property which is set within a 70-hectare plate approved, and intends to replace it with a larger house complete with a swimming pool and tennis court.

The luxury home will also boast its own orchard and croquet lawn, as well as renovating a derelict barn to feature a snooker room and two more bedrooms.

The new property will boast plenty of space for animals with existing stables in place and plans for a kennel and dog.

In an blog post written on the Top Gear website in early 2009, Mr Clarkson said he had bought the farm in Chipping Norton and planned to whizz around on quad bikes with his children.

Other prominent supporters of the Heythrop Hunt include Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and her husband Charlie Brooks, who is a racehorse trainer.

Mr Brooks was also in the town square in Chipping Norton today where hundreds of people turned out to greet the horses and their riders.

He was seen holding up a sign advertising the next hunt meeting and mingling with the crowds.

It emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election

The Prime Minister David Cameron has also ridden with the hunt six times, which is close to his constituency home in Oxfordshire.

In 2003, he described the then proposed ban on hunting as ‘illiberal and bossy’.

The Heythrop Hunt was one of 300 taking place up and down the country today, which comes 10 years after the Hunting Act was passed banning fox hunting.

However, it emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election.

Thousands of supporters are expected to have took part today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair as a piece of 'red meat' to keep his backbenchers on side.
