England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton insists he retains 'every faith' in coach Peter Moores despite England's humiliating exit at the World Cup on Monday.

A 15-run defeat to Bangladesh saw England crash out in the group stages of the one-day tournament after a dismal campaign that included four defeats in five matches.

Moores' tactics and team selection have come under heavy scrutiny since he was appointed head coach 11 months ago but Downton insists the former Lancashire coach remains the right man for the job.

'I have every faith in Peter Moores,' Downton told Sky Sports.

'Part of the reason for appointing Peter Moores was he is a very experienced coach.

'Whoever took this job was going to have a really difficult job.

'We had a side that broke up in Australia, we had to introduce new players and part of dealing with it - which was obviously going to be pressurised - was that experience.

'We're very early into an appointment. Much as we'd like to change things instantly, it takes time.

'Look at New Zealand and where they were with their one-day cricket two years ago - it takes time to bring things through.

'We had a very successful team between 2009 and 2013, we have to rebuild again.

'There are no shortcuts. We have to back our players, invest in them and in time we will be back there again.'
