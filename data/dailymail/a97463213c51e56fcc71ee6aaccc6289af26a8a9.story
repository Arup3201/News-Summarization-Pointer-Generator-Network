It was half past midnight on Saturday night when David Moyes made his way to the Real Sociedad team bus and he admitted: 'Normally I would have watched Match of the Day and gone to bed by now.'

That apart, the culture shock was minimal for Moyes on his managerial debut in La Liga on what seemed like a very British night in north-eastern Spain. There was foul weather, feisty challenges, a touchline row that ended in a red card, and even a Saltire flag flying among the pocket of travelling supporters, to make the new coach feel at home.

Moyes said he was pleased with his team's first half display and said the signs were encouraging that his players can take on board his demands for greater intensity.

He said: 'Some people might think you can come here and you are only going to find tiki-taka style but there is intensity to the Spanish game too. You see that with Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona.

'I have got some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also don't have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it's right to do so.

'Intensity doesn't mean that you just run around a lot, your intensity can come from the way you pass the ball or if you have one player who can beat someone one on one. It depends on what you have and I need to find out how we will express our intensity as I get to know my players.'

Moyes enjoyed a very British start to has career in Spain

That will become increasingly easier as Moyes spends more time with them on the training ground. He admitted after his first game: 'It is not easy at the start because the players probably aren't even understand how I'm shouting their name at the moment in my broad Scottish accent.

'I've given myself a big challenge. I could have taken other jobs in the Premier League but I wanted to show that I could come out here and do well.'

Moyes was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his new squad into Spain internationals emulating the success he had with individual players as Everton coach.

Moyes says there are some very talented footballers at Real Sociedad

At Goodison Park he helped players such as Seamus Coleman, Leigthon Baines, Phil Jagielka and Leon Osman to play for their countries and after drawing his first game in charge on Saturday he said: 'I would like to think that my reputation for making players better and in some cases turning them into internationals is pretty good.

'I have got some good young players here and the academy here is really good. [Ruben] Pardo is a good young player and Inigo Martinez is another. My challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months. I have done it with one or two others so hopefully I can do it with them as well.'

His debut might not have given Real Sociedad their first away win of the season but it was memorable from the moment the team plane touched down… and then took off again at La Coruña's airport.

'The weather was so bad the plane couldn't land – it came down and went back up again twice,' said Moyes. 'We ended up having to land at a different airport.'

The rain kept up throughout a hard-fought goaless draw marred in the first half by the sending off of Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud who reacted furiously as Moyes gestured for him to calm down as he made his way down the tunnel.

Moyes said afterwards. 'I joked to my assistant when the referee made the sending off that I could see myself getting in trouble on my debut. There was a British feel to it with the rain coming down and the way the tackles were flying in during the first half.'
