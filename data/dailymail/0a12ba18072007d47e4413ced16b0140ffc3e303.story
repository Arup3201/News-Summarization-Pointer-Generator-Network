Blindfolded, his hands bound, a condemned prisoner puffs desperately on a final cigarette.

Just a few minutes later he and two others are led up a short flight of stairs, nooses are placed around their necks before a trapdoor opens beneath their feet. This is justice Kuwait-style.

The Gulf-Arab state hanged three convicted murderers today, the first executions to take place there since 2007, state news agency KUNA reported.

Sentenced to death: Three men hang from the scaffolding in Kuwait in the first executions in the country since 2007

Last cigarette: A Saudi man is allowed a final smoke before being led to the gallows

Final minutes: One of the three convicted murderers is seen before being led to his death

The three were a Pakistani, a Saudi 
and a stateless man who were hooded and bound before being hung from 
gallows outside the Central Prison, official pictures showed.

They had been found guilty in three separate murder cases. Authorities had invited journalists from Kuwaiti publications to witness the executions.

The last recorded case of the death 
penalty being carried out in Kuwait was six years ago when a Pakistani 
man was executed for drug trafficking, according to Amnesty 
International.

Kuwait, which has a population of 
around three and a half million people, operates a judicial system which
 is a mixture of Islamic Sharia law, English common law, and the Ottoman
 civil code.

The state carried out 72 executions (69 men and three women) between April 1964 and May 2007.

Crimes that carry the death sentence 
include drug trafficking, murder and treason. Sentences are not carried 
out publically however members of the media act as witnesses and 
pictures are published in the hope it will act as a deterrent

KUNA said 48 people remain on death row in Kuwait.
