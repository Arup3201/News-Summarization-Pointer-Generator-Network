If really you want to cut your grass in a hurry, Honda engineers have created just the job – the 130mph lawn mower.

It has been specially adapted from a conventional lawn tractor by the firm’s top British race technicians who have turned it into a super-charged blade-runner.

And with performance that will propel it from rest to 60mph in under four seconds it will be a match for many supercars and outpace most family runarounds – if you’re brave enough to sit on it.

Fast: The Frankenmower can reach speeds in excess of 130mph and goes from 0-60 in less than four seconds

The ton-up lawn-tractor’s creation coincides with the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the Japanese car-maker announced it was setting up the new F1 racing McLaren-Honda  team headquarters in Milton Keynes.

And  it features exclusively in the August special edition of the latest Top Gear magazine to be published on Wednesday July 17 as part of its focus on the Performance Cars of the Year, where the Top Gear team have dubbed it the ‘Frankenmower’.

Top Gear magazine’s chief road tester Piers Ward, who took the lawn mower for a spin ahead of their in-house racing driver, the Stig, said: ‘In a Top Gear world littered with stupid stunts, driving a 130mph mower ranks up there as being one of the more unhinged.’

The Frankenmower is based around a 
conventional HF 2620HT Honda lawn-mowing mini tractor costing around 
£4,000, though that family of mowers starts at around £2,000.

Honda’s
 Team Dynamics engineers – which runs their touring car race squad - 
spent three months adapting it to make it the cutting edge of Blade 
Runner racing lawn mowers.

First
 they ripped out the standard pedestrian 614cc engine and replaced it 
with a far more powerful 1000cc engine from a Honda Firestorm VTR motor 
bike. It develops 109brake horse-power – roughly the same as a Ford 
Fiesta.

They fitted a 
hi-tech 'spaceframe chassis' like a proper racing car and converted part
 of the skirt-like grass collector at the back to contain the fuel tank 
and various radiators.

The 
driver is nevertheless particularly vulnerable. There’s no seatbelt - 
the idea being that you are thrown clear in an accident -  no traction 
control, no airbag, no ABS anti-lock brakes and no protective roll cage -
 so you won’t see it on the road.

But it does have a petite fire extinguisher strapped to the rear wing.

Top
 speed is 133mph and it will accelerate from rest to 62mph in around 
roughly four seconds – performance figures to rival many supercars.

But
 the whole machine, complete with terrified driver, weighs just 205kg, 
which gives it a tremendous power to weight ratio (532bhp/tonne) which 
is higher than a super-fast but super light Caterham R500 ( at 
520bhp/tonne).

Cutting grass is indeed still possible thanks to two spinning 4,000rpm electric motors with metal brake cables.

But ton-up speeds aren’t possible when you’re mowing because with the cutting deck attached, the ground clearance is about a centimetre.

The tyres are borrowed from a racing quad-bike and are reported to be ‘as soft as marshmallows’.

Top Gear Road-tester Mr Ward explained: 'Apparently, if they were any harder, there’d be so little grip that the mower would swap ends as soon as you got on the throttle.'

He added: 'The noise is ridiculous – like the offspring of a nuclear explosion and a machine gun – and it’s spitting small blue and orange flames from the side-mounted exhaust.'

Describing the sensation riding this ‘flame-spitting garden implement’ on a race-track he said: ‘It feels incredible.

'This must be a bit like how Andy Green felt before he went through the sound barrier in Thrust SSC for the first time.'

He said: 'It fires up the pit straight with such ferocity that I’m pretty certain I left some of my internal organs behind. There is absolutely no slack. Instant power, instant gear changes. I’m through the first corner in a blur.

‘But, despite all the noise. It’s actually fairly easy to drive. You’re locked into the tiny seat so tightly that you can feel every single bump. The steering isn’t as brutally sharp as I thought it might be.’

He noted: 'Towards the end of the lap, my confidence gets the better of me, and I decide to see what’s really possible. We hit 100mph, and I must admit to a fleeting thought at this point – if this goes wrong, quite a lot of pain isn’t far away. But the mower and I survive, and as I round the final corner, the red Honda popping and banging like an angry firework.’

Honda spokesman Paul Ormond said it created the ton-up mower to comemorate its re-entry with McLaren into F1 racing from 2015 and its move to new racing HQ in Milton Keynes.

‘We wanted something a bit different to celebrate so we thought a 130mph lawn mower would be jus the job,' he said.

He added: 'We still still do sell conventional versions of this lawn mower. They may not do 100mph plus, but they will cut your grass and keep your garden looking smart.’
