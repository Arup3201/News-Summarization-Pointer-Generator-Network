A breakthrough in translation technology could one day enable you to converse in Chinese without ever actually learning the language.

The new technology uses deep neural networks to take the accuracy and speed of language translation far beyond what was previously thought possible.

A video posted on YouTube yesterday shows Rick Rashid, head of Microsoft Research, explaining improvements made to machine understanding of English words, with his talk automatically transcribed as he speaks.

But it is when he activates audio translation that the technology becomes really impressive, as it speaks to his audience in Mandarin - using Mr Rashid's own voice.

Mr Rashid presented the amazing new technology in Tianjin, China, at Microsoft Research Asia's 21st Century Computing event last month.

Although research into computer speech recognition has been underway for the past 60 years, until recently even the best systems had word error rates of between 20 and 25 per cent.

However, working in collaboration with the University of Toronto, researchers had Microsoft two years ago made a breakthrough.

Using a technique called Deep Neural Networks, in which machines learning is patterned after human brain behaviour, researchers were able to train their software to understand speech better than ever

'During my October 25 presentation in China, I had the opportunity to showcase the latest results of this work,' Mr Rashid said in a Microsoft TechNet blog post.

'We have been able to reduce the word error rate for speech by over 30 per cent compared to previous methods. This means that rather than having one word in 4 or 5 incorrect, now the error rate is one word in 7 or 8.'

He added that this was the biggest breakthrough in the accuracy of computer speech recognition in more than 30 years.

Mr Rashid explained that the new technology works via a two step process. First the software recognises the English words he is saying and finds the equivalent in Chinese, which he says is the 'easy part'.

Then it gets to grips with the rather more difficult task of reordering the words to fit the syntax of Mandarin Chinese, without which the translation would be a incomprehensible string of seemingly random words.

'Most significantly,' Mr Rashid added, 'we have attained an important goal by enabling an English speaker like me to present in Chinese in his or her own voice, which is what I demonstrated in China.

'It required a text to speech system that Microsoft researchers built using a few hours speech of a native Chinese speaker and properties of my own voice taken from about one hour of pre-recorded (English) data.'

'Though it was a limited test, the effect was dramatic, and the audience came alive in response.

'When I spoke in English, the system automatically combined all the underlying technologies to deliver a robust speech to speech experienceâ€”my voice speaking Chinese.'
