Ronny Deila has told John Guidetti that the only way to end his goal drought is to forget he’s ever had one.

The on-loan Manchester City striker turned in an improved display against Partick Thistle on Wednesday but still couldn’t prevent his run of games without scoring reaching double figures.

The Swede, who at one stage boasted an 11 goals in 10 strike-rate, has cut a frustrated figure of late with talks over a permanent move to Parkhead failing to reach a satisfactory conclusion.

Guidetti once had a scoring record of 11 in 10 for Celtic but has since fallen on hard times

But Deila believes the key to him getting back in the scoring groove lies with ensuring he is firstly mentally attuned to the task.

‘He has to stop thinking about it and he will score goals as well,’ Deila said. ‘Because you have to think of the process, not results. Goals come as a consequence of good processes.

‘That is maybe the most important thing I have to try and get into this culture. Everything I hear is about results but you have to think how to get those results.

‘And when you fill all the boxes you need to, then you will get those results. That’s how I work and how my players have to work as well.

‘When I see my players working 100 per cent and are switched on, then I know we are going to beat the other team.

‘One day it is John Guidetti doing well, getting two or three goals, the next it is Leigh Griffiths. And then Stefan Johansen. If we are a good team, the chances will come.’

Deila’s side face St Johnstone at lunchtime today and he is adamant Thursday’s clash with Inter Milan hasn’t yet been mentioned to his players although he admits he is liable to pick his team for Perth with one eye on the Europa League clash.

‘They won’t be on my mind,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘I have learned in this job that you have to take it one game at a time.

‘You have to keep the momentum going, you have to win, and if I don’t think only of the next game then the players start to think of something else.

‘Inter Milan is coming next week, but the biggest game is on Saturday. If we have a good performance against St Johnstone then we will take a lot of confidence into the game against Milan.

‘I don’t think the team on Saturday will be the same as the team that plays Inter Milan.

‘We need competition, but healthy competition. It is like we want to make each other better. I pick the player I think best suits the game.

‘Some players can’t handle the load to play so many games so we have to change. James Forrest didn’t play against Partick but he will be ready for Saturday.

‘We have to use the squad wisely and always try to look ahead while keeping the consistency in training and matches. If we do that then everyone will develop.’

Only Mikael Lustig and Charlie Mulgrew look set to miss out on Thursday, but Inter have a defensive injury crisis brewing.

Former Manchester United stopper Nemanja Vidic has become the sixth member of Roberto Mancini’s rearguard to labelled a major doubt after suffering from sciatica and will definitely miss tomorrow’s trip to Atalanta.

Centre half Marco Andreolli and right back Danilo D’Ambrosio are both out with hamstring injuries and Japanese international full back Yuto Nagatomo will miss both legs with a thigh tear.

Roberto Mancini returned as manager of Inter Milan for his second spell at the helm of the club in November

Defender Mikael Lustig (centre) is a doubt for Celtic's encounter against the Italian side next Thursday 

Additionally, Brazilian right back Jonathan is sidelined for the season after undergoing a knee operation. Captain Andrea Ranocchia is also struggling with a knee knock with Mancini set to scramble together a makeshift defence to face the Hoops.

Meanwhile, Inter fans have been banned from tomorrow’s clash at Atalanta after previous crowd trouble. The Bergamo club - who have had problems with their own supporters - have opted not to give Inter tickets for safety reasons for the Serie A clash.
