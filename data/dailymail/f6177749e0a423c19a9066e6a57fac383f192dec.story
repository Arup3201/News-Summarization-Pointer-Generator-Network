Former Jersey Shore star Michael Sorrentino, better known as The Situation, agreed to attend anger management lessons while in court today.

Sorrentino, 31, will take the classes for 12 weeks as part of a deal to resolve simple assault charges he faced following a June 15 fight with his brother Frank at their family's tanning salon in Middletown Township, New Jersey.

A municipal court judge accepted the deal today and if Sorrentino successfully completes the counseling program, the charge against him could be downgraded.

Sorrentino's family, including his brother Frank, attended the hearing today in New Jersey.

The reality star was arrested on June 15 at the salon, which is the setting for a new reality show about them.

Police got a 911 call reporting what was described as a 'fist fight' between two people but only Sorrentino was detained, later emerging with a rather painful-looking black eye.

The fight was between the star and his brother Frank and the 911 caller told police that she had to run out of the tanning salon to the UPS store next door when it broke out.

A UPS employee next door could hear the siblings 'bouncing off the walls' during the punch up, TMZ reported.

Mike told police that the brawl started after he and his brother argued over how their sunbed business should be run, according to TMZ.

The reality star posted bail in the amount of $500 and was allowed to leave the police station in Middletown, soon after the arrest.

It's been a difficult time for the family business, as TMZ reported that employee pay checks bounced in June.

Sorrentino worked as an assistant manager of a fitness center in Staten Island before fame came calling.

When he was 25, he lost this job and began underwear modelling, which led to a role in the smash hit MTV show.

Mike has two older brothers, Frank and Marc; younger sister Melissa completes the siblings.

Marc also serves as The Situation's manager and partner in MPS Entertainment.

The cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore, filmed in Seaside Heights, were known for their love of tanning and the motto GTL, or gym, tan, laundry.

They also were known for a rowdy, partying lifestyle that resulted in some cast members getting in fights and others facing legal troubles for alcohol-related incidents.
