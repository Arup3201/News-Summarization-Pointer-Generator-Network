If you've ever wanted to soar over Earth on the world's largest parachute, now is your chance – and you don't even have to leave your desk.

This dizzying footage of Nasa's 'flying saucer' will take you 180,000ft (35 miles) into Earth's atmosphere as it travels four times faster than the speed of sound.

The saucer, dubbed the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD), is designed to someday deliver large payloads, such as vehicles, to Mars.

Scroll down for video 

The footage shows the June test conducted over Hawaii, which although successful, didn't go quite to plan with the parachute failing to unfurl properly.

The goal of this flight test - the first of three planned for the project - was to determine if the balloon-launched, rocket-powered, design could reach the altitudes and airspeeds needed to test two new breakthrough technologies destined for future Mars missions.

Carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle.

The Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) is a large, doughnut-shaped air brake that deployed during the flight, helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound.

Fire power: This image shows rockets burning on Nasa's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) as the saucer-shaped test vehicle flies into near-space

Soaring high: The the balloon which carried LDSD into high altitudes can be seen here. The image was taken by the saucer-shaped test vehicle's high-resolution cameras. Nasa said the test of technology they hope to one day use on Mars achieved most of its objectives and taught them lessons for their next attempt

Moment of truth: The parachute is shown here unfurling on the right. The balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb (90kg) parachute from its sturdy canister

The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag.

When attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at Mach 3.5 it will be capable of slowing it down to Mach 2, where a regular parachute can then deploy.

To simulate the Martian atmosphere on Earth, the LDSD was lifted to a height of 80,000ft (35 miles) by a high-altitude balloon.

A small rocket then launched it 11 miles (18km) higher. As this point the LDSD inflated around a larger saucer-shaped object, bringing it safely back to land in open water.

The second, the Supersonic Disksail Parachute, is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown.

It has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission that carried the Curiosity rover to the surface of Mars.

'A good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things, and that is certainly what we have in this case.' said Ian Clark, principal investigator for LDSD at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

'Our test vehicle performed as advertised. The SIAD and ballute (a combination between a balloon and parachute), which extracted the parachute, also performed beyond expectations.

'We also got significant insight into the fundamental physics of parachute inflation.

'We are literally re-writing the books on high-speed parachute operations, and we are doing it a year ahead of schedule.'

'As far as I am concerned, whenever you get to ride shotgun on a rocket-powered flying saucer, it is a good day,' said Mr Clark.

'We hope the video will show everyone how beautiful and awesome the test was, and to just to give folks an insight into what experimental flight test is all about.' 

Deflated: The test vehicle is seen here before (left) and after (right) the balloon that helped carry it to near-space was deflated. The plume left by the test vehicle's main engine can be seen in these images. Engineers arranged for the balloon to deflate and descend shortly after the rocket fired

Damaged: The Supersonic Disk Sail Parachute, one of the new technologies being developed as part of Nasa's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) project, floats in the Pacific Ocean after the completion of its first flight test, on June 28. Tears are visible in the parachute, which did not unfurl as expected

Nasa officials were still pleased with the flight for the $150 million (£90 million) experiment, and said it was a pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to Mars. 

The space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the same parachute design in use since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976.

The launch over Hawaii was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no-fly zones.

Technology needs to advance, or else humanity won't be able to fly beyond the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit, according to Michael Gazarik, head of space technology, at Nasa headquarters.

'Technology development 'is the surest path to Mars,' Mr Gazarik said.

Back to Earth: The divers, from the U.S. Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, retrieved the huge LDSD vehicle just hours after the successful test in June

Big catch: Divers retrieve the test vehicle for Nasa Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator off the coast of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range in Kauai, Hawaii
