A 35-year-old Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with a 16-year-old student is now facing allegations of sleeping with a second teenager.

Brianne Altice's September trial for three counts of rape and one of forcible sodomy has been delayed after prosecutors laid a further charge of each, claiming she also slept with a 17-year-old.

A court heard in June how the former teacher claimed she was the victim because the first boy 'wore down her defenses' and her lawyer's request to throw out the charges was dismissed.

According to KSL, the charges show Altice held a position of 'special trust' with both minors.

Her lawyers claimed the 16-year-old admitted he set out 
to have sex with Altice and that it was therefore legally consensual. It
 is illegal in Utah for a teacher or anyone in a position of power to 
have sex with a person under 18.

'She
 repeatedly refused and declined his advances until he ultimately broke 
down her resistance,' defense lawyer Edward Brass claimed, according to 
the Salt Lake Tribune.

'The state failed to establish probable cause to believe that the intercourse that occurred was without consent.'

However, Judge John R. Morris threw out the motion - saying that there was probably cause they try Altice. He set a September trial date.

The statuesque blonde former English teacher at Davis High School in heavily Mormon Kaysville, Utah, sobbed as she left court with her family.

The 16-year-old boy told investigators in last November that he had had sex with Altice on three occasions in 2013 and testified to that fact at a preliminary hearing in February.

According to the Standard-Examiner the teen said in the preliminary hearing that he was upset because his family had moved to Utah from another state.

He said he was having problems and home and doing drugs and that he would skip class to hang out with Altice.

Fighting it: Altice pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of raping the 16-year-old. But the boy told police they had sex multiple times in 2013 before her October arrest and that their first sexual encounter was in a church parking lot

Poised: The 34-year-old Utah woman no longer teaches at the school. Her husband filed for divorce in November shortly after her arrest

Soon a sexual relationship began after an initial encounter in a church parking lot, he said.

The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body.

Altice's husband filed for divorce shortly after his wife's arrest. It was finalized in December.

'The defendant occupied a position of special trust in relation' to the juvenile, prosecutors wrote.

Altice was originally arrested in 
October. Altice was believed to have had sex with a 16-year-old on many 
occasions, including at her South Weber home and at a park in addition 
to the church parking lot, a Davis County Jail report states.

Altice was only hired by the high school last August, but had previously worked for other schools in the district since 2004.

‘Anytime
 a story surfaces like this ... I think it all causes us concern because
 these are members of the community that are held to a higher standard,’
 district spokesman Chris Williams told Deseret News.

Altice is the fourth Utah teacher currently facing charges of sexually abusing children.
