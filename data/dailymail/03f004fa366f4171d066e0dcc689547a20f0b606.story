On trial: Andrew Reeve, 55, and his wife Lesley, 56, of Hartlepool, County Durham, are accused of theft

A husband today denied stealing more than £100,000 from his wife's vulnerable godmother and claimed the alleged victim had told the couple to spend her life savings ‘as we saw fit’.

Andrew Reeve, 55, and his wife Lesley, 56, of Hartlepool, County Durham, are accused of reducing 91-year-old dementia sufferer Joan Killen's bank accounts from £130,000 to just £3,000 in two years.

The prosecution claimed some of that went on converting a garage into a wet room and gym, but the defendants said they were making it into a bedroom for her to live in.

Mr Reeve told Teesside Crown Court that Miss Killen, who lives in a care home and considered the couple as her only family, was ‘delighted’ with the plan to move in with them.

He claimed she then showed the couple her will ‘and told us we could spend what we needed to do the modernisations, and she also said we could use it as we saw fit’.

Mr Reeve claimed the spinster told him they could use the money for ‘anything’. She wanted to see the couple enjoy her money while she was still alive, he claimed.

The court has heard the couple paid off debts of more than £11,000, bought a car and regularly shopped at Next, Marks & Spencer and Argos.

Mr Reeve became a signatory for her bank accounts and transferred money from savings to her current account, the court heard.

Building work: The home where the Reeve couple proposed the garage conversion would be carried out

The couple are accused of stealing 
£95,000 from her savings, plus her pension, winter fuel allowance and 
money they made by renting her home out once she went into care.

In the planning application to convert
their garage, the couple stated it was for a gym and wet room, but Mr 
Reeve said this was not true and they intended it to be for Miss Killen.

But when police arrested the couple 
they found an exercise ball and treadmill in the room - which Mr Reeve 
said was a coincidence.

Matthew Bean, prosecuting, said: ‘The 
truth is you had no intention of ever having Miss Killen to come and 
live with you, did you?’ Mr Reeve replied: ‘That's not true.’

Mr Bean continued: ‘You have made up 
this account in an attempt to explain away how you spent almost all her 
life savings.’ Mr Reeve said: ‘That's not true.’

'We love her, we love Joan. We are her only family and we haven't been able to see her for 19 months'

Andrew Reeve

Earlier, he claimed he and his wife have been unable to see the pensioner since their arrest last year.

‘We love her, we love Joan,’ he told the jury. ‘We are her only family and we haven't been able to see her for 19 months.’

The couple jointly deny four counts of
theft. The case was adjourned until tomorrow afternoon when Mrs Reeve's
defence is expected to start.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
