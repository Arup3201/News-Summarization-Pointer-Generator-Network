A couple have been left with no snaps of their wedding day after their photographer lost their treasured pictures - stored on a memory card - in a drunken brawl.

Instead Jackie Sanderson, 22, and new husband Adam, 30, only have two badly-framed and blurry photos taken by guests on a disposable camera to remind them of their special day.

The couple agreed to let their friend Ben Fagan - a budding professional photographer - take the pictures to help boost his portfolio.

Empty memories: Jackie Sanderson, 22, and new husband Adam, 30, have been left with no photographic memories of their big day - after their photographer lost the memory card during a boozy night out

After the wedding at St Mary The Virgin Church in Par, Cornwall, Mr Fagan, 24, tucked the memory card into his wallet and left it there for a week before taking it to a funeral.

But at the wake he got heavily drunk and was kicked out of a pub during a scuffle during which his jacket - still containing the wallet - was lost.

The couple returned from their honeymoon a week later to be told all their images had been lost.

They have been left with just two muzzy images from the disposable cameras they left for guests on the tables.

Mrs Sanderson who lives in St Blazey, Cornwall, said: 'I am absolutely gutted. We can't even talk about the wedding now, the whole thing has left a bitter taste in our mouths.

'It was such a wonderful, perfect day. Both of us said that we were only going to get married once, so we made it really special.

'I thought we were doing Ben a favour by letting him take our pictures and now this. I am so upset and angry about it.

'I know that it was just a horrible accident but who loses their wallet after getting that drunk? He hasn't even called me up to say sorry.

'Ben has gone out with his friends after and got really, really drunk. He started a fight with one of his friends and they were thrown out of the pub.

'He can't remember when he lost his jacket. We have spent hours looking through rubbish outside the pub and putting up posters.

'I am just so disappointed. All I wanted was one picture of us standing outside the church on our wedding day to put up in our home. Now we don't have that.

'He was the only one really taking any pictures.

'We did put disposable cameras on the tables but people didn't use the flash so hardly any have come out.

'All we've been left with is a few shots of the back of our heads after we walked out of the church.'

The couple, who met while working at Fowel Hall Hotel in Cornwall, began planning their dream white wedding nine months ago.

They invited 60 family and friends from around the world to celebrate with them at St Mary The Virgin Church in Par, Cornwall, on May 25.

The newlyweds then enjoyed two days in five star Upton House in Fowey, Cornwall, before spending six days in the Cotswolds.

After the wedding, Ben slipped his 16 GB memory card from his camera into his wallet, which he then put into his black suit jacket for a friend's funeral on Friday June 1.

But he lost the jacket at the Royal Talbot pub in Lostwithiel as he brawled with a friend in a drunken row - either before or after being thrown out of the pub by the landlord

Mr Fagan, from Lostwithiel, was unable to find the jacket that evening and subsequent searches have failed to turn it up.

He said: 'I'm absolutely devastated to have lost my best friends' photos of the best day of their lives.

'It's on my mind constantly. I thought my wallet was the safest place.'

Mrs Sanderson, a hotel receptionist, has scoured the town and put up posters appealing for anyone who has seen the memory card and jacket to come forward.

She added: 'There are so many memories we won't get back. My dad died two years ago so my mum, Alison Jones, walked me down the aisle instead.

'Two of my sisters were bridesmaids and I know there were so many lovely pictures. I am so desperate to see them.

'People have suggested doing a mock wedding to take more photos but we just can't afford it and it is not the same.'

The couple are hoping to leave for a two-year trip to New Zealand in late July and say it would be a 'dream come true' to have the pictures before they leave.
