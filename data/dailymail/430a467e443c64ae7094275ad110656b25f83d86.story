Danon Edwards, 33, of Syracuse, is accused of breaking a police officer's jaw after punching him at the scene of a traffic accident in May

A former marine who blamed wartime trauma after he was charged with attacking a police officer was a food service specialist who never left the country, it has been reported.

Danon Edwards, 33, of Syracuse, is accused of breaking a police officer's jaw after punching him at the scene of a traffic accident in May.

In court, Edwards' lawyer said his client's military service from 1999 to 2003 left him emotionally scarred and unable to work.

His military records however show during his time in the Marines he was a 'food service specialist', Syracuse.com has reported.

The Marines have said they have no records of Edwards being deployed overseas, according to the Associated Press.

Authorities allege Edwards hit North Syracuse Officer Robert Florian several times following a four-vehicle crash, which Edwards was involved in.

He appeared in court on July 8, where his lawyer Chris Gaiser said his service 'may have had an effect on his emotional stability', according to Syracuse.com.

The judge, who had freed Edwards on $50,000 bail, ordered a mental health evaluation for the former marine. He is due to next appear in court on Friday.

Last week it was reported that a U.S. 
Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly 
bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance after 
spending more than three months in a Mexican jail.

A Mexican judge ordered Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, to remain behind bars as his case works its way through the Mexican legal system.

Sgt Tahmooressi's lawyer told reporters it was unfortunate that his client has to remain behind bars, but that he feels the case is moving in the right direction.

Attorney Fernando Benitez, told reporters that irregularities - specifically the fact that his client was not given consular services after his arrest for nearly eight hours - is grounds for a dismissal of the charges.
