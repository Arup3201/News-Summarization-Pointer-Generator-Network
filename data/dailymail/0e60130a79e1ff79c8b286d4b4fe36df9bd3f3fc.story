Controversial comedian Eddie Izzard has announced plans to stand in the 2020 London mayoral election.

The heterosexual transvestite revealed he will throw his hat into the ring, unless the capital is already being led by a Labour mayor in which case he plans to run for parliament instead.

The 51-year-old, who has campaigned for the party in four general elections, said he would be suited to the role as he does 'things in a different way'.

Izzard, who has cross-dressed on stage and performed the world's largest ever global standup tour said he hoped his presence in politics would inspire young people to become involved.

'I think I can put a lot of energy 
into it, I think London's a great city, I think I can bring unusual 
things to the table, and think in a different way, why shouldn't I be mayor?' he said.

'Everybody says I would be a good fit for mayor because it's a personality-led thing,' the comedian told the Guardian.

Yemen-born Izzard said he felt would be a good representative for theÂ city, having started his career as a street performer in Covent Garden.

He added the prejudices he has had to face as a transvestite makes the criticisms thrown at political figures look easy in comparison.

'I have always learned how to do things while struggling at the beginning to work out they work. I'll probably screw up, but I'll learn.'

In 2009 Izzard ran 43 marathons in 52 days in aid of Sport Relief, carrying the flag of the home nation he was passing through at the time as he completed the 1,000 mile feat.

The 51-year-old has amazed fans by performing the French leg of his most recent tour entirely in the native language, and plans to learn Spanish, German, Russian and Arabic in the near future.

His plans to run in the 2020 mayoral election have been met warmly by Labour party members, with MP Tessa Jowell describing the news as 'a vote of confidence'.

'Eddie is a man of enormous substance, generosity and conviction,' she said.
