Bill Clinton joked on Thursday about wanting his fellow former president George W. Bush to paint him naked, now that he has become something of an amateur painter.

There were bursts of laughter as Clinton made the remarks about his counterpart's hobby during a speech at the opening of the George W. Bush Library in Dallas.

At the end of a speech praising the achievement's of Bush's presidency, Clinton said: 'I probably shouldn't say this but I'm going to anyway.'

He said that George W's mother 
Barbara Bush had shown him some of his landscape and animal canvases 
and that he thought they were 'great'.

Portrait sitting? Bill Clinton joked about wanting Bush to paint him naked during his speech at the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center on Thursday

Creative flair: George W Bush told Diane Sawyer during an interview on Wednesday that it's not easy to paint  water hitting water -  as in this work he created of his bathtub

Mr Bush's self portrait: In the interview he said 'By the way, that's not that easy to paint, water hitting water just so, you know, and the perspective. It's a beauty, isn't it?'

Clinton then quipped: 'I seriously considered calling and asking you to do a portrait of me until I saw the results of your sister's hacked emails.

'Those bathroom sketches are wonderful but at my age, I think I should keep my suit.'

He was referencing self-portraits found in hacked Bush family emails which appear to show paintings of the former president shaving in the 
shower and soaking in a bathtub.

Bush said in an interview this week that he now 
has a slower pace of life and makes sure that he sits at his easel every day in his Texas mansion.

'I love to paint. It is - painting has changed my life in an unbelievably positive way,' the former president said.

Earlier this year some of his work was revealed after the Bush family emails were hacked. One photo showed Mr Bush, 66, standing at an 
easel, dabbing at a canvas. 

The photos were posted online and Mr Bush referenced them in Wednesday's interview with ABC News’ Diane Sawyer saying:  'By the way, that’s not that easy to paint, water hitting water just so, you know, and the perspective… It’s a beauty, isn’t it?'

'It may reflect my precocious nature, me painting myself in a bathtub,' he added jokingly as he sat next to his wife Laura.

Presidential painter: Former President George W. Bush spent a month getting private painting lessons in Florida alongside his sister-in-law, where he showed a fondness for painting small dogs

Hobby: Mr Bush said that he now has a slower pace of life and makes sure that he sits at his easel daily at his Texas mansion

Skill: His teacher, Bonnie Flood from Cummings, Georgia, said that the Republican was very passionate and talented

Range: Though he initially enjoyed painting dogs, Ms Flood said that she made him also paint landscapes like his ranch in Crawford, Texas

But Mr Bush admitted he was not overawed with his painting and does not think he has a real talent.

'Fortunately, I haven’t seen those reviews,' he said. 'Look, the signature is more valuable than the painting.'

The two-term President has led a 
significantly quieter life since leaving office in 2008 - spending much 
of his time painting and going on mountain bike rides with groups of 
veterans like Wounded Warrior.

In an interview with the Dallas Morning 
News published two Sundays ago, Bush added that painting gives him an 
opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what others think of his 
work.

'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.'

In March an artist who taught Mr 
Bush how to paint both animals and landscapes in a recent month-long 
course spoke out his skills as a late-in-life painter.

Mr Bush spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons.

'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood.

She revealed that the former President loved painting pictures of dogs, though she eventually broke him of his habit and helped him paint pictures of his Crawford, Texas ranch.

'He picked it up so quick, it was amazing actually. His whole heart is in it,' the Atlanta-native told the local Fox News affiliate.

His passion for dogs comes as little surprise, as his pet Scottish terrier Barney was a constant presence around the White House during his two terms and was the star of the annual Christmas tour video.

'I think he said he's painted 50 dogs,' Ms Flood said.

As the library's opening approached, Bush and his wife embarked on a round-robin of interviews with all the major television networks, likely aware that history's appraisal of his legacy and years in office will soon be solidifying.
