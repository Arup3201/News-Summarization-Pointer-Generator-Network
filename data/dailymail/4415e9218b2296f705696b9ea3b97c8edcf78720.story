Change: Fergie's dramatic weight loss was plain to see when she was in New York last week

She is said to have shed more than two stone on a gruelling three-month bootcamp in the Swiss Alps.

And Fergie’s dramatic weight loss was plain to see when she was in New York last week.

Wearing her hair scraped back off her face, the Duchess of York looked tired and drawn as she left a restaurant in Manhattan.

And the 54-year-old’s physique looked noticeably trimmer in a fitted blazer, which she teamed with a crisp white shirt and a patterned blue and white scarf.

Fergie, who once weighed almost 16st, revealed she had been sticking to a diet of blended foods, daily runs and mountain hikes for 12 weeks.

She said in December: ‘I went up to the mountains, and I ran every day. That’s how I got fit. I may have lost 30lb, but I want to help combat global obesity.’

The duchess’s daughter Princess Eugenie is currently living and working for a fine art auctioneer in New York.

The family were reunited in the city last year when Eugenie was spotted shopping with her mother and dining out with father Prince Andrew.
