James Haskell is confident he will be back to his fighting weight and in a fit state to face the All Blacks next week, despite a meningitis scare which led to a very anxious week in hospital.

The Wasps captain was blazing a trail towards November’s QBE Test series at Twickenham as one of the form back-rowers in the country when he was abruptly struck down by a mystery virus earlier this month.

What began as a cue for mocking jokes about man-flu and mad cow disease ended with a trip in an ambulance, medical confusion and extreme weight loss.

Haskell was on his way home from a trip to Manchester on October 16 when he began to feel unwell. The condition rapidly deteriorated and, by October 20, he was being tested in hospital amid fears he had contracted meningitis, which can be life threatening.

That was eventually ruled out, but the savage virus he was struck down with proved hard to shake off. Having checked in for England duty last Sunday, Haskell relived the alarming episode yesterday, saying: ‘I’ve never been that ill in my life. It was weird, it just came upon me.

‘The Wasps doctor visited me at home and said, “There’s something wrong with you”. I said, “We all know that, but there’s something more wrong than normal!”.

‘They sent me to hospital. I went to Princess Margaret and they assessed me there, then they put me in Charing Cross on Fulham Palace Road. A week later, I came out on Friday. They thought I had meningitis and that was the big concern. That’s why they put me in an ambulance. They were saying, “You can’t mess around with that”.

‘They knew it wasn’t bacterial meningitis but they thought it might be the viral version because I had all the symptoms. So they got me straight on to the anti-virals and antibiotics.

‘The thing was, I got better a little bit so they stopped some of the stuff, then next day I hit rock bottom again. They weren’t sure what was going on so they did a lumbar puncture and took fluid out of my spine, and numerous blood tests.’ Haskell is an energetic character who did not enjoy being consigned to a hospital bed for the best part of a week. His usual routine of regular meals and punishing gym sessions were put on hold and it was an uncomfortable scenario for him.

‘I’m not used to being inactive for that long,’ he said. ‘The big thing for me was not eating. I lost a lot of weight — about five kilos in a week.

‘I normally eat five or six times a day but I was struggling to get one or two meals in. The hospital food was good, but the lady was telling me off if I hadn’t eaten.

‘I couldn’t open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light. My lower back and neck were very stiff so I couldn’t really move out of bed. I spent hours lying in bed with a cold flannel on my head, in a dark room, on a drip, not eating or drinking — man down, really. My temperature was up to 38 degrees.’

By his own reckoning, Tuesday was the first day that Haskell felt more or less back to normal. The illness appeared to check his powerful charge towards an England starting place next month, but he remains convinced that he is well placed to feature against New Zealand.

‘I knew this (England) was coming up, I had been playing well and I wanted to keep that momentum going,’ he said.

‘The good thing was that I didn’t try to force my way back too soon. You’re only as good as your last game so I’m pretty positive because we got a good win against Bath — it was a few weeks ago now!

‘I trained with the forwards today, I did some stuff yesterday and I’m building back up every day.

‘I would be extremely disappointed if my illness had a factor in whether I am involved or not.

‘We have had two days of the camp. I have missed one session outside. I think that as of Thursday I will be back into the full mix of it, so I don’t think that is going to be an issue.’
