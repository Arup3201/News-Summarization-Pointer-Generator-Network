He's known for shocking viewers with his controversial stunts - and his latest one has already prompted a wave of criticism.

Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson managed to draw a large penis on an LA storm drain by skidding around in his car.

And while the outspoken celebrity was clearly pleased with his effort - branding it a 'gentleman's sausage', viewers called him and fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May a trio of 'sad old men'.

Jeremy Clarkson seemed quite pleased by the result of him driving on the storm drain

Clarkson, 52, raced his fellow presenters Hammond, 43, and May, 50, in Sunday night's show.

After the race the camera panned out to reveal he had drawn the private parts using skid marks. He said: 'I've accidentally painted a gentleman sausage on a storm drain', the Daily Star reported.

But, despite his delight at his handiwork, some members of the audience were not impressed.

Glenny Rodge wrote on Twitter: 'Sad 
documentary on BBC2 about three old men whose sexual inadequacies have 
developed into them having vehicle fetishes,' according to the Daily 
Star.

Series 19 of the
popular BBC2 car show will see the trio go on a road trip across the 
U.S., from the Nevada desert to the Mexican border in new cars.

the show was first aired in 1977 as a conventional 
motoring magazine show but since a major relaunch in 2002 it developed 
into the quirky and humorous show of today.

It has an enormous following worldwide with an estimated 350 million views per week in 170 different countries.

As well as receiving widespread 
acclaim for its presentation and variety of ideas, it has also received 
criticism for its sometimes controversial and politically incorrect 
commentary.
