A hunky Baltimore police officer has been inundated with marriage proposals after a photo of him cuddling a stray kitten he rescued and then adopted went viral.

Jon Boyer, 26, has always had a soft spot for animals and regularly drops off stray cats and dogs he finds around the city to the Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter. But when he brought in an adorable kitty last May, his good deeds became an internet sensation after the animal shelter posted a heart-melting picture of the pair on its Facebook page.

The image received more than 4,000 likes and several hundred comments praising his selfless work -- and handsome looks.

Teasing: While he's fielding a steady stream of marriage proposals from his female fans, he said his fellow officers have responded to his newfound fame by jokingly nicknaming him 'cat man'

However, he insisted rescuing stray animals was just 'one of the million things' he and his colleagues' do on a daily basis.

While he's fielding a steady stream of marriage proposals from his female fans, he said his fellow officers have responded to his newfound fame by jokingly nicknaming him 'cat man.'

This was worth it if it meant bringing a greater awareness to the cause of helping stray animals in need, he said.

'If (the media interest) is giving animals a chance to get rescued that wouldn't have had a chance to before because someone sees my story, that makes me happy,' he said.
