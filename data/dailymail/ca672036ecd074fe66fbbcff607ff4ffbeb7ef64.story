It was all smiles in this wedding photo - a beautiful bride, her groom and his identical brother.

And it was clearly hard to tell them apart...

Ralph Evans is toasting 60 years
of marriage to wife June - after he posed as his twin brother to get a date
with her.

Mr Evans, from Ashton under Lyne, Greater Manchester, fancied June when he met her back
in 1949 but there was one problem - his twin brother Ronald had just started dating her.

So Ralph came up with a devious plan to
win the girl of his dreams.

He told a white lie to Ronald that June had left a
message saying she couldn't make their second date - and then went himself and pretended to be his brother.

Ralph Evans pretended to be his identical twin, Ronald (far left), to get a date with June in 1949. Three years later, they wed at their local church in Oswestry Shropshire (above) before honeymooning in Ashton under Lyne

The couple hit it off and three years later tied the knot.

Now Ralph and June are marking their diamond wedding anniversary alongside their four
children - Carol, Wendy, Gail and Colin - 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

Ralph said: 'I told her who I was
afterwards because she was starting to get suspicious.

'It all worked out well though because
Ronald started courting someone else and was very happily married.'

Now Ralph and June are marking their diamond wedding anniversary alongside their four children, 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren

June, 79, said: 'I met Ralph on
Christmas Eve 1949 and he was with his identical twin. They were extremely
similar.'

Ralph and June were married on March 15,
1952 at their local church in Oswestry Shropshire before honeymooning in Ashton
under Lyne.

Ralph, 82, a keen crown green bowler, said: 'My sister lived in Ashton so we used to visit frequently and really fell in
love with the area.

'June and I both come from a small town
and we like coming to Manchester - it was the big city. There was always
something to do and plenty of work up here.'

The couple made a permanent move to
Tameside in 1964 and have lived in Ashton ever since.

June spent much of her working life as a
laundry assistant while Ralph worked as a store-man at Piccadilly Plaza in
Manchester.

The couple will celebrate their anniversary with a family meal.

Ralph, whose twin brother died two years
ago, said: 'We all have our arguments - especially when you've been married for
60 years.

'The secret is to forget about them -
don't hold any grudges and always talk to each other.'

June added: 'We've always said pull
together through the worst times and the best.

'We're husband and wife but also best
friends.'

Ronald Evans had only stepped out with June once... before his brother Ralph made his cunning move

Happy ending for all as Ronald soon met someone else
