Ed Miliband was today accused on live TV of being out of ‘touch with reality’ after underestimating his family's weekly food shopping bill.

The Labour leader, who has attacked the government over the cost of living, claimed he spent around £70 or £80 a week on groceries.

But he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £100, as he claimed his £140,000 salary meant he was ‘relatively comfortably off’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband appeared taken aback as he was challenged about the cost of a weekly shop

Mr Miliband was put on the spot on ITV's Good Morning Britain about whether he understood times were tough

Mr Miliband admitted he was 'relatively comfortably off' but insisted he could still tackle the problems the country faces

Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’.

But
 he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family 
of four. Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr 
Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’

Pressed
 on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80
 a week on groceries at least, probably more than that.

‘The
 point is that different families will have different costs that they 
face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many 
people.’

But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch.

She
 told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than 
£100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or 
£80.

‘People
 will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually 
talking about something but not in touch with reality.’

ITV presenter Susannah Reid suggested Mr Miliband's answer showed he was 'not in touch with reality'

Inflation rose for the first time in 10 months in April, stalling hopes for a pick-up in real terms wages.

The
 Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation ticked up to 1.8 per 
cent after hitting a four-year low of 1.6 per cent the month before, the
 Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Latest
 figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent meaning a
 hoped-for sustained period of pay rising faster than the cost of living
 has yet to materialise.

Today's
 widely-expected inflation figure still means it has been at or below 
the Bank of England's 2 per cent target for five months in succession - 
with the rate expected to remain low for some time.

But it ends a period over which CPI fell for six straight months.

Mr Miliband earns £139,000 as leader of the opposition, and his wife Justine is reported to earn £200,000-a-year as a lawyer.

The couple live in a £2million family home in north London with their sons Daniel and Samuel.

But
 Mr Miliband insisted he understood how people were struggling: ‘Sure, 
lots of people are facing real struggles and I’m relatively comfortably 
off but what l know is that there are deep issues that need to be 
tackled and we’re determined to tackle them.’

He went on to admit that he does not face a cost of living crisis himself.

‘I
 don’t but I can deal with it and I can tackle it and I am determined we
 do and I recognise it as I go around the country and I see the 
difficulties people are facing and that is what I hear and that’s what I
 am determined to tackle.’

Mr
 Miliband later admitted that his shopping estimate may have been on the
 low side, saying he had been thinking of the bill for 'basic 
groceries'.

Speaking
 on BBC Radio Oxford, the Labour leader said: 'Well, I said this morning
 it was on the basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about 
£70 or £80 - the total shopping bill was slightly higher than that, 
obviously.

'On the basics, I was saying it was about £70 or £80 but the overall shopping bill would obviously be higher.'

A
 Tory source said: 'It’s the same old economic incompetence from the 
Labour party that gave Britain the biggest peacetime deficit in history.

'They have no long-term plan to fix the economy and Ed Miliband can’t even get the numbers right for his political gimmicks.'

The blunder is a fresh setback for Labour’s cost of living campaign, particularly on the sofa of an ITV show aimed at mothers.

Labour was ridiculed for this advert attacking a VAT rise which included fruit and vegetables which are not covered by VAT

Mr Miliband has repeatedly attacked the government for its policies, which he claims have left people worse off.

But the party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a VAT rise to 20 per cent had added £450 to the average bill.

It featured pictures of fruit and vegetables which are not covered by VAT, raising doubts about who signed it off for public release.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who is in charge of the party’s economic policy, distanced himself from the advert.

‘Look, these campaigns are busy times and there’s always lots of things going on…’ Mr Balls said.
