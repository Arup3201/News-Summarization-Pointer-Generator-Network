A meat processing plant in northern Poland has been shut down after it was discovered using rotten meat in their products.

Health and safety inspectors halted all work today after a television program exposed dodgy practices at the factory, and alleged that expired products were used.

Footage of green-hued sausages was broadcast on Polish channel TVN24 and an anonymous staff member said that 'tons of old meat' was added to new products instead of being destroyed.

Another worker can be heard saying the green sausages would be 'cleaned, dried and added to new products'.

Deputy chief veterinarian Krzysztof Jazdzewski said today that inspectors immediately went to the plant and closed its meat processing section.

A thorough inspection has been started at the plant, which, he said was called ‘Viola.’

TVN24 later said that the management of the plant in question has denied that stale meat has ever been added to its products.

‘There are no grounds for the allegations,’ TVN24 quoted from a letter that was signed by Krzysztof Miecinski, identified as the president of the board of managers.

Jazdzewski could not immediately confirm TVN24's allegations but said the program showed procedures that violate the law and that could be harmful to consumers.

It showed old meat stored together with fresh meat, which usually leads to bacterial contamination of the fresh meat and of the entire storage area.

Another problem he heard mentioned in the program was that processed meat was frozen and then de-frosted.

Jazdzewski said there have been no signals previously of irregularities at the plant and that a separate investigation has been opened to explain that.

The plant exports to European Union markets, although it is not clear whether the UK has been exposed to any rotten products from the factory.
