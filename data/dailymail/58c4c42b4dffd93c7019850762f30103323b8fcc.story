A former Miss Belgium is planning a Jamie Oliver-style campaign to get all British children to sit GCSE exams in sex education.

Sex therapist and TV presenter Goedele Liekens believes the way sex education is handled in British schools is 'hopelessly out of date'.

Now, in a bid to get British children better informed, she is hoping to follow in the footsteps of TV chef Oliver who used a television series to campaign for better school dinners.

Liekens' hour-long one-off Channel 4 show, Sex in Class, will argue for a GCSE in sex education when it airs and the channel hope a series will follow, it was reported today.

The programme will feature Liekens, who is also a UN Goodwill Ambassador, visiting the classrooms and homes of British schoolchildren, working with 15 and 16-year-olds.

Liam Humphreys, Channel 4's head of factual entertainment, said: 'The way she looks at the world and sex education is going to be the most marvellous culture clash with even the most liberally minded British teacher.

'Some of the things acceptable [in other countries] – teaching 10-year-olds all about masturbation – is obviously going to stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable over here, but if you analyse what she is saying it makes complete sense.'

Liekens told a Belgian newspaper the UK has been 'too prudish for too long' about sex education.

'England has just about the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe,' she said. 'Now they have finally realised that it is best to teach youngsters about feelings, relationships and sex.'

But the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said sex education should be left to parents.

The society's Safe at School campaign national coordinator Antonia Tully told MailOnline: 'They don't need to spin this out over a GCSE! What are they going to cover?

'It's horrifying. Where are the parents in all this? 

'The big myth is that you need to give children sex education like this to protect them from sexual abuse, but there is no research that shows there is a link between lack of sex education and abuse.

'It's just playing on parental fears. For a former Miss Belgium to come in and say this is not helpful. We don't need lessons to titillate teenagers. This is not the best approach to ensuring children are protected. 

'Parents are the best people to talk to children about these intimate details. Sex isn't an academic subject, it is a personal matter.'

The society also warned that much of the teaching in schools already uses explicit material that is inappropriate for young children.

Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum.

But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject.

Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years. 

Last week the Liberal Democrats announced plans to force all state schools, including primaries,  to teach sex education.

Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’.

The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer.

Countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the UK.

In the Netherlands, sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six. It has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world.

British parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes, and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children.
