Fears: TUC boss Brendan Barber says youth unemployment has reached 'crisis' levels in Britain

A generation of Britons could be left on the scrapheap as one million young people are still out of work, official figures revealed today.

The situation is at 'crisis point' as one in five 16 to 25-year-olds cannot find a job and many have been looking for years, unions have said.

At least half the one million unemployed youths have been searching for work for six months or more.

And as youngsters collect their A-Levels this week they are being warned their future job prospects look bleak in the toughest jobs market for 20 years.

Despite a slight fall of 4,000 youngsters dropping off the dole queue in the last three months, TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'If this continues we could lose a generation of talented, highly qualified youngsters to blighted careers, debt and under-achievement.

'Students looking to start their 
careers or continue in their education next month are facing the 
toughest climate for nearly 20 years.

'It's
 particularly worrying that long-term joblessness for young people is 
still rising, even as overall unemployment falls.

'The
 Government's economic strategy is holding young people back. It's time 
for a new plan that invests in their futures, rather than stunting 
careers before they've barely begun.'

Young people looking for a job or planning to continue in education are facing the toughest outlook since 1992, he added.

More than one in five people aged between
 16 and 24 were out of work, significantly higher than in 1992, when the
 rate was 16 per cent, he said.

While the proportion of young 
people in full-time education has almost doubled from 24 per cent in 
1992 to 41 per cent this year.

But the Government maintains that they are getting young people into work.

Tough: There are one million young people in the dole queue

A
 spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'This
 is nothing but scaremongering from the unions at a very sensitive time.
 The last Labour government did all they could to manipulate youth 
unemployment figures and hide the real picture.

'Youth
 unemployment fell last month and there are fewer young people on 
Jobseekers Allowance or any other temporary support now than there was 
in May 2010. This is still a big challenge and we don't underestimate it
 for one moment.

'We are
 fully committed to helping young people get the skills and experience 
they need to get a job. Over the next three years the Youth Contract 
will offer nearly 500,000 opportunities for young people through work 
experience, apprenticeships and wage subsidies to help them find work.'

A survey by the National Union of 
Students showed that three out of four youngsters intending to go to 
university this autumn are worried about getting a job after they finish
 their course.

The poll of 800 students also revealed that around two thirds had concerns about finances while they studied.

NUS
 vice president Rachel Wenstone said: 'For many people, a university 
degree has traditionally given them the opportunity to access the 
employment of their choice. Now those who make it to university are no 
longer guaranteed employment in the way that previous generations were.

'Unemployment
 amongst graduates is still lower than for those without a degree but 
those getting their A-level results this year face harder decisions than
 many about their futures.'

Paul
 Brown, Director, youth charity The Prince's Trust, added: 'There is an 
alarming number of unemployed young people who lack the skills and 
confidence they need to find work, and it is these young people that 
need urgent support.'

Overall unemployment fell by 65,000 
between March and May to 2.58 million, although the number of people 
claiming jobseeker's allowance in June increased by 6,100 to 1.6 
million.

But the drop has been mainly been put down to the Olympics.

David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce , said: 'The latest job market figures are encouraging, and act as a welcome contrast to recent pessimism about the UK economy. Employment is up, unemployment is down, and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991.

'But there are still areas of concern. Youth unemployment is unacceptably high, and too many people are still being forced to work part-time as they cannot find a full-time job. While unemployment is likely to increase over the next 12-18 months, the peak may now be lower than the 2.9m figure we predicted in our last forecast.'
