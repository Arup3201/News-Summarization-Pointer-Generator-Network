Wasps No 8 Ashley Johnson has been cited for an alleged dangerous tackle on Leinster wing Dave Kearney in the 20-20 draw at the Ricoh Arena on Saturday.

Johnson tackled Kearney straight from the opening kick off in the European Champions Cup clash and was shown a yellow card by French referee Jerome Garces following the incident.

But Johnson, 28, could now face further sanctions with European Professional Club Rugby investigating whether Kearney was taken out in the air as he tried to claim the kick off.

'Johnson is alleged to have committed a dangerous tackle on the Leinster wing, Dave Kearney (No 11), in the opening minute of the Pool 2 game at the Ricoh Arena in contravention of Law 10.4(i),' EPCR said in a statement.

Johnson's case will be heard at a hearing in Dublin on Thursday.Â
