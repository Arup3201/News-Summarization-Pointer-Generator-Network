They were fighting to win the match for their opposing sides in Sunday's Premier League clash, and it appears Chelsea's Eden Hazard thought that might be taken literally by Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure at half-time.

Hazard was caught on camera, via Manchester City's official YouTube channel, looking rather startled as he was slapped on the back of the head by Toure as the two teams were appearing for the start of the second half at the Etihad Stadium.

Turning around to see who the culprit was, Hazard's initial anger quickly subsides as he sees the Ivory Coast star smiling back at him - who then attempts to strike him again playfully before they re-enter the pitch.

And it would have been Toure who would have finished the match the happier of the two as his side rescued a point against their title rivals.

Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser against his former side to earn Manuel Pellegrini's side a 1-1 draw against Chelsea.

Lampard's strike cancelled out Andre Schurrle's second half opener after Pablo Zabaleta had been sent off for the hosts.

Speaking after the match Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted the draw was a fair result against the Premier League champions: 'We were winning the game against 10 men, but the same 10 men had a fantastic reaction and gave everything to try to equalise,' he said.

'When the game gets emotional the numbers are not so important. When the game is tactical - yes they are important.

'We scored, we had the game seemingly under control, we hit the post but then they scored.

'At that point the game was emotional and in that period they were psychologically stronger than us and in the end a draw is maybe a fair result.'
