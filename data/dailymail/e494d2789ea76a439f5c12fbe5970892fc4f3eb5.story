Manchester United are now able to mix it with the best after the turbulence of the last year, claims Gary Neville. 

Robin van Persie's stoppage time equaliser handed Louis van Gaal's side a deserved point against Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday. 

That, says Neville, feels like a win and proves they are capable of returning to former glories.

'It's a big goal for United,' Neville told Sky Sports's Super Sunday.

'They'd have been deflated – because they did play well in the game – to come out and lose. It will feel like a win.

'The performance level, forget the result, but the performance level was a higher level than Manchester United have produced all season against an excellent team; the best team in the league.

'They had to step up a level today and they did. I thought they were fantastic in the first half and they genuinely caused Chelsea problems.'
