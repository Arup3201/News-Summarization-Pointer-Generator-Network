France had no legal right to fine a man for calling its former president Nicolas Sarkozy ‘a sad p***k’, the European Court of Human Rights ruled today.

In a judgement which could have wide-ranging implications for other countries, including Britain, it was decided that Herve Eon was allowed to use a particularly crude version of the expression ‘Get Lost!’ on a banner waived at the diminutive politician.

In 2008, Mr Eon was in Laval, north west France, when he waved an abusive banner bearing the words ‘Casse-toi pov’con’.

Herve Eon said the European Court of Human Rights' decision to overturn the fine was a 'great day' for him

They were the exact words which Mr Sarkozy had himself used towards a man who refused to take his hand at a Paris agricultural show earlier in the year.’

Translations for ‘pov’con’ have varied, but today the European court said that it meant ‘sad p***k'.

When the words were used, Mr Sarkozy was at the height of his unpopularity in France, having recently made former supermodel Carla Bruni his third wife.

Many viewed the 5ft 5ins conservative president as a ‘bling-bling’ chancer who was using high office to attract women, and to enrich himself.

But Mr Eon was fined 30 euros, the equivalent of £26, for waving his banner in front of a large crowd.

Mr Eon was found guilty of insulting the president under France's 1881 Freedom of the Press Act.

But the fine was originally suspended in a Laval court ruling in November 2008, as Mr Eon’s lawyers said it infringed freedom of speech laws.

The European Court said the penalty imposed had been ‘disproportionate’ and violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards freedom of expression.

A court press release said such action by the authorities was ‘likely to have a chilling effect on satirical contributions to discussion of matters of public interest, such discussion being fundamental to a democratic society’.

Mr Eon, a Socialist Party activist, today said he was delighted by the ruling, explaining: ‘It’s a great day for me – it’s the right decision.’

Mr Sarkozy, who led the centre-right UMP party, was defeated in the May 2012 presidential election by Socialist rival Francois Hollande after serving a single term of office.

There was no immediate comment about today’s ruling from Mr Sarkozy, who is facing a number of corruption inquiries in France while also trying to build up a career on the international conference circuit.
