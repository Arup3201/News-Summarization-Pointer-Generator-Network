For modern celebrities product endorsements and advertising campaigns are a lucrative source of income.

Even naughtier stars such as Rihanna and Snoop Dogg can rake in the dollars by attaching their image to a brand.

But how would these famous faces have fared in the 'golden age' of advertising? One French creative has set out to answer that question through a set of fascinating images.

David Redon, an art director at an advertising agency in Paris, has created a selection of prints merging famous vintage adverts with modern-day celebrities.

Each celebrity is paired with a retro advert referencing their career or personality, whether that's Daft Punk playing poker for a 'Get Lucky' casino poster or Michael Jackson's 'Beat it!' transformed into a poster for mosquito spray.

Other cameos include Rhianna and Drake in a beauty ad entitled 'Take Care', Amy Winehouse advertising 'Back to Black' coffee and Pharrel and his 'Happy' Toothpaste.

David told Adweek that he had explored the project as of way of showcasing the fine line between art and the consumerism.

'I
 like the shift between vintage and modern pop culture, because these 
days the border between art and commercial is very small, and artists 
work their images like brands do.'

The French creative went on to tell Adweek that, surprisingly, the amazingly accurate images aren't as time consuming as you might imagine.

'I started working on this project last summer, but it started to buzz maybe two months ago. It takes me one or two hours to create an ad. I search for the ads I like and then retouch in the artists and sometimes modify the layout, create a logo, etc.'

Following his success David's prints have even become available to buy on the American home-wears site, Society6.

David is continuing to create the images, to see the full collection visit his blog here.
