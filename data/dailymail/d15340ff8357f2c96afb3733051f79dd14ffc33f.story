A youth club gifted a Banksy artwork has been offered £1million for their piece because it comes with a rare letter from the mystery artist.

The painting, called Mobile Lovers, had appeared overnight on a plank of wood screwed to a wall close to the Broad Plain Boys' Club in Banksy's home town of Bristol.

The struggling club hoped that by selling the piece they would be able to remain open. However, the artwork was removed by the city council, who maintained they owned the wall, and put on display in Bristol.

Open to offers: A boys' club gifted this Banksy artwork has been offered £1million for their piece because it comes with a rare letter from the mystery artist

But the artist, whose identity is shrouded in mystery, waded in to the row by writing a letter to Dennis Stinchcombe, who runs the youth club, giving him his 'blessing' to do what he felt was right with the art.

Mr Stinchcombe now says he has had offers in the region of £1 million for the piece - with bidders from across the globe hoping to get their hands on the painting of two lovers entwined in an embrace while checking their mobile phones.

Some art critics have said the man in the painting resembles former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

'We have had big offers from as far away as Beverly Hills,' he said.

'But I am concerned about choosing an appropriate auctioneer and one which is respectful of the work.

'I seen Banksy be critical of some of these auctions for the types of his art they sell so you have to be sensitive.

'For now it is in the gallery for everyone to see but we are hoping to pin down an auctioneer this week some time.

'Some of the offers we have had have 
been in excess of £1 million and the letter we have from Banksy is also 
thought to be very rare.

'It’s all great news for the club and 
we hope to sell it for as much as possible to settle our finances and 
secure our future over the next few years at least.'

The painting was first discovered at the club in St Jude’s, Bristol, on April 15 after Banksy posted a picture of the new design on his website.

Funding: Mr Stinchcombe said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club (pictured) as well as help fund other youth projects in the area

The cash-strapped youth group, who needed to find £120,000 just to stay open after struggling due to the recession, insisted Banksy wanted them to have it and planned to sell the work to fund the future of the club.

They removed the artwork to protect it from vandals and put it on display inside the club.

However, Bristol City Council said it was not '100
 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached 
to, and days later removed the piece with the support of police.

It was put on display at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery while its ownership was decided and more than 10,000 people viewed it over the Easter weekend alone.

But on May 6 Mr Stinchcombe received the letter from Banksy, who gave the cash-strapped boys club permission to sell it.

The following day the city's Mayor George Ferguson received a similar letter from Banksy confirming it was genuine.

Safe keeping: Before the artwork was taken by the council, the club had removed it from the wall and positioned it inside to protect it from vandals

The artist had written: 'I don't normally admit to committing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges won't be brought anytime soon you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece.

'I'm a great admirer of the work done at the club and would be chuffed if this can help in some way.'

After confirming the origin of the letter, Mr Ferguson tweeted: 'Just received confirmation by #Banksy that note to #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club is authentic. Great to have a clear resolution.

'As far as I'm concerned it [the artwork] now belongs to the club as I'd agreed once confirmation received from Banksy.

Resemblance: Some critics of the piece have suggested the man in the painting looks like former Prime Minister Tony Blair

'I've received confirmation by #Banksy that note is authentic & 'Mobile Lovers' can go to the #Bristol Broad Plain Boys Club :-)'

It is thought the letter from the artist has helped significantly increase the value of the artwork which was initially estimated to be worth up to £400,000.

Mr Stinchcombe said the sale of the piece
 would safeguard the club, which has been running for more than 100 
years - offering activities such as boxing and other sports, for future 
generations, as well as help fund other youth projects in the area.

Mr Ferguson said the painting was currently still on display at the museum, and that visitors who had come to view the artwork had raised £2,000 for the club.

'This has been a wonderful Bristol story and typical Banksy mystery,' he said.

'I had agreed with Dennis at the club, after they had removed it from the wall of the adjacent council depot, that it was best that we took care of the picture and displayed it to enable people to view it while we waited to hear Banksy’s intentions. In the meantime it has resulted in us raising over £2,000 in donations for the club. 

'I shall be delighted to hand over the picture to the Boys’ Club once we’ve ticked all necessary boxes when it comes to the proper legal process. 

'We shall be planning the handover of the picture and assisting the club in any way we can in their ambition to raise maximum funds through its sale. In the meantime it will remain on display in Bristol.'

UK-based street artist Banksy is known worldwide for his stencils which 
often carries political messages or questions about society.

Despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for thousands, his true identity remains a secret - leading to a network of myths surrounding him and it is rumoured that his own parents don't know what he does,  believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator.

There is also the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all.

Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism.

However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation.

He has allegedly been photographed in the past but has always been wearing a mask or hood.

In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story.

Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.'

Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated.

His most famous artworks include Naked Man - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and Balloon Girl, which he has created several versions of across London including Hackney and the South Bank.
