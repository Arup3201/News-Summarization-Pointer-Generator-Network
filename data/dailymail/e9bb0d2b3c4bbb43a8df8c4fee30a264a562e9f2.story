'Oh my God, this is not happening!' Ms Williams exclaimed, as she buried her head in her hands.

As the cameras continued to roll, Mr Dunson, 35, appeared to get stage fright.

After initially struggling to get his words out, he then got the point.

'I couldn't wait another day to tell you that I want to love you for the rest of my life.

'I just 
wanted to know, will you love me for the rest of yours?' he asked Ms 
Williams.

Spouses-to-be: There is no word on when the happy couple  are planning to tie the knot

She told CNN: 'I had just anchored the 6pm
 newscast and I was reading cut-ins for the 10pm after the show.

'When I 
fill in I usually only have to read two cut-ins but my producer had me 
read an extra one. The last one I read said 'An Odessa woman is about to
 get the surprise of her life and eventually a new last name!'

'I was 
really confused when I read it and then my boyfriend [now fiance] walked
 in and proposed! I'd say I had a pretty awesome 4th.'

There is no word on when the happy couple are planning to tie the knot.
