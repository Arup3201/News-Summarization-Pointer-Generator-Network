Woody Allen has been spotted strolling on New York's Upper East Side with millionaire child sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein, who served time for hiring minors to 'massage' him at his Florida mansion.

A source told The New York Post's Page Six the former hedgefunder was 'hugging (Allen) and taking close to his ear' on Sunday, with the eccentric film director's effective step daughter-turned-much younger wife, Soon-Yi, in tow.

'[He] had his arm on Woody's shoulder,' the spy added.

The three were walking together along
Madison Avenue and began 'talking and laughing' as they neared 
Epstein's $50 million East 71st Street town house and went inside, the 
source told The Post.

Allen, 77, who lives on East 70th Street with his 42-year-old wife, has rubbed shoulders with convicted sex-offender before.

The sometime actor was a guest at a celebrity-filled soiree Epstein threw for his best pal Britain's Prince Andrew in December 2010.

Sex-offender: Jeffrey Epstein, pictured, served a 13 month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution

Epstein served 13 months of an 18 month sentence for soliciting a 14-year-old for prostitution.

In court papers, the victim was only identified as 'Jane Doe.'

At one point, Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple sex offenses, The Post reported.

Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out underage girls and paid them $200 to $1,000 for sexual massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and Manhattan.

But the financier avoided a longer possible sentence after he signed a secret non-prosecution deal under which the government agreed to drop its investigation into the string of sex-crime allegations if Epstein confessed to prostitution felonies in Florida state court.

Epstein settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls since his sentence, with many recieving payouts in excess of $1 million.

In 2011, a New York judge ruled Epstein should be listed as a level 3 sex-offender - the highest and most dangerous level.

This was despite the millionaire joking to The Post that his crimes were comparable to 'stealing a bagel.'
