Television coverage of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony is under threat after BBC workers announced a 12-hour strike.

Thousands of journalists and technicians at the corporation will walk out next Wednesday, jeopardising coverage of the flagship event that evening.

Singers Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle and Amy Macdonald will join 3,000 volunteer performers for the ceremony at Glasgow’s Celtic Park, watched by a global TV audience of one billion.

But the BBC’s coverage of the event, hosted by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine and Clare Balding, is now at risk after members of the NUJ, Bectu and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action, to run from midday to midnight on Wednesday, in a dispute over pay.

Last night the corporation was unable to say whether or not viewers face a blackout, and whether or not emergency staff would be drafted in.

Critics have attacked the decision, describing the walkout as unnecessary.

Scottish Tory sports spokesman Liz Smith said: ‘The news of this strike is extremely disappointing, especially because it is clearly deliberately timed  to coincide with the launch of the  Commonwealth Games.

‘There is absolutely no need for this strike to go ahead.

‘When athletes have given up so much to train and prepare for the opportunity of a lifetime, the various unions are preparing to strike, which has the potential to cause completely unnecessary unrest just when the Games are beginning.’

The turnout for the NUJ ballot has not been disclosed, but 77 per cent of its members voted for strike action.

Some 79 per cent of Bectu staff came out in favour but it is understood only 42 per cent of BBC members voted in its ballot.

Campaigners said journalists at the corporation have seen a 10 per cent pay cut in real terms over the past five years and that too much is being spent on salaries and perks for managers.

NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet described the turnout in the strike ballot as ‘decisive’, adding that the result ‘clearly  demonstrates that journalists across the BBC are not prepared to put up with paltry pay deals any longer’.

She added: ‘Members are prepared to take sustained action in this dispute and will name further dates if it is not resolved.’

Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of Bectu, said: ‘The BBC can find money for vanity projects but cannot find money for its own staff, whose pay has dropped by 10 per cent in the past five years.’

The BBC has offered staff earning less than £50,000 a year an increase of £650, with those earning more than £50,000 receiving £500 - although that excludes senior managers.

When the Games were hosted by Manchester in 2002, they reached 40.3million people – nearly 73 per cent of the UK population – while the audience peaked at 9.7million for the closing ceremony.

The BBC has promised that Glasgow 2014 will be its biggest Commonwealth Games, with 1,300 hours of live coverage.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We will do all we can to bring our audience uninterrupted coverage of the Commonwealth Games.

‘We will continue to speak to the unions in an attempt to resolve this dispute. However, we have made an improved offer and are mindful that we need to make significant savings and deliver more for less.’

A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 and Games Partners said: ‘The BBC are doing all they can to bring full coverage of the Glasgow 2014 Opening Ceremony to audiences.’
