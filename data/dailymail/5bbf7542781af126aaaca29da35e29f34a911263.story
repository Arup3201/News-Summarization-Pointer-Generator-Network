A mother who tragically lost her three daughters and parents in a house fire three years ago has written an open letter to Houston shooting survivor Cassidy Stay urging the brave teen to ‘love all around you’ in order to ‘feel a tiny bit better.’

Madonna Badger lost nine-year-old
 Lily and seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace, plus her parents, 
Pauline and Lomer Johnson in the fire on Christmas morning 2011.

Like many, she has been inspired by Stay's smiling stoicism, despite losing her entire family.

Madonna Badger has written an open letter to Houston shooting survivor Cassidy Stay urging the brave teen to 'love all around you' in order to 'feel a tiny bit better'

Stay, 15, watched in horror last Wednesday as her ex-uncle allegedly executed her parents and four siblings at her family home.

The
 heroic Texas teen survived the July 9 massacre by playing dead when a 
bullet grazed her head, before calling police - an action which saved 
the lives of her grandparents, who Ron Haskell was intent on killing 
next.

In an open letter, Badger decided to share some words of comfort and her own grieving process after the tragic loss of her family, reports Today.

‘I 
screamed and cried tears that felt like blood,’ she wrote, before urging
 Stay to cling on to love in order to heal from her own horrific ordeal.

Dear Cassidy,

No one knows how you feel right now but you. And that is probably questionable...I still don't know how I 'feel' half the time.

So I don't have any advice for you. I can only tell you what happened to me.

Day by day everything changed. Hour by hour.

My sadness is still so deep but it has changed. I accept it more now.

I screamed and cried tears that felt like blood.

And here is the thing that saved me. LOVE. The love of my children and my parents that is still in my heart.

And the LOVE of friends and doctors and perfect strangers.

The love in the world that has cradled me and soothed me and cared for me.

And accepting the LOVE all around me has helped my forever broken heart.

So even though I said I didn't want to give you advice...I will say just this one thing.

Try to let the love all around you in...and little by little you will feel a tiny bit better.

And that's all there is. LOVE.

I love you.

Madonna

‘Try to let the love all around you in...and little by little you will feel a tiny bit better,’ she advises the teenager.

Badger has previously spoken about how her friends and life-changing charity work at an orphanage in Thailand helped her deal with suicidal thoughts and a dark depression.

Badger has now returned to work in New York City and is looking forward to getting married next year to a long-time friend William Duke, a long-time friend who appeared by her hospital bed the day of the tragedy in 2011.

Generous strangers struck by Cassidy Stay's bravery have donated more than $320,000 to an online GoFundMe campaign called 'Stay Strong' to assist her.

The 'Stay 
Family Tragedy - Cassidy Stay Fund' went live on Thursday, the day after
 the massacre, and within 24 hours approached $150,000.

Silver lining: Cassidy, pictured far left with her entire family, said that one day she will get to see her mother, Katie, father, Stephen, and siblings Bryan, 14, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7, and Zach, age 4

Outpouring of support: Cassidy Stay, 14, has received $320,000 from well-wishers after she was left as the sole survivor when her uncle killed her family

'We had no idea that it would be the official site for that the family,' Jody Dellinger, one of the founders of the site, told Community Impact News. 'The outpouring just dumbfounds me when you have a tragedy like this.'

On
 Saturday, Cassidy and her grandfather Robert Lyon attended a 
celebration of life organized in Spring to remember their slain loved 
ones.

After
 taking a deep breath, a smiling Cassidy mounted the stage to address 
more than 400 people who came out to pay tribute to her parents and 
siblings, as seen in a video of the event recorded by Click2Houston.

She began by thanking those people who have been praying for 
her and the entire Stay family, and the first responders and medical 
personnel who took care of her.

With
 her voice slightly cracking, Cassidy said: 'I'm feeling a lot better 
and I'm on a very straightforward path to a full recovery.' 

Before 
continuing her prepared remarks, the brave young woman drew another deep
 breath and then proceeded to quote from one of her favorite books in 
the Harry Potter series.

'In
 the Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore says, “Happiness can be found even 
in the darkest times if one only remembers to turn on the light,”’ she 
told the audience, wiping away tears.

In a voice filled with emotion, Cassidy Stay then told those in attendance she is certain that she and her family will be reunited someday.

'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca, and Zach are in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day,' she said.

Cassidy then flashed a smile and exclaimed, 'Stay Strong,' which has become a rallying cry for the girl's family and the Spring community.

Before the event at Lemm Elementary School, Cassidy helped release 600 colorful balloons into the air - 100 for each slain member of her family.

Katie 
Stay, 34, her husband, Stephen, 39, and four of their five children 
between the ages of 4 and 14 were shot dead in their suburban Houston 
home last Wednesday.

Ronald Haskell, 33, has been charged with capital murder in connection to the massacre.

During
 his first court appearance Friday, a disheveled-looking Haskell with 
handcuffs on his wrists collapsed in twice as a prosecutor read out 
details of the crime.

The heavyset man had to be lifted into a wheelchair and removed from the courtroom.

Authorities
 have said Haskell was searching for his ex-wife, Katie Stay's sister, 
Melanie, when he came to the Stays' home in Spring.

He tied up
 the family and put them face-down on the floor before shooting each in 
the back of the head, according to investigators. The family had refused
 to say where Haskell could find his ex-wife.

Investigators
said that Cassidy suffered a skull fracture from a bullet 
graze but survived by playing dead to call 911 and warn police that 
Haskell planned to shoot other relatives.

Haskell was eventually cornered in front of the home of Cassidy's grandparents and taken into custody.

Al
 Barker, the lawyer who represented Melanie Lyon in her divorce from 
Haskell, has revealed to MailOnline that Haskell's ex-wife believes 
their split after 11 torturous years of marriage was to blame for the tragedy.

The attorney relayed a conversation he had this week with Melanie's mother, who told him that after learning the news of her sister and nephews' deaths her daughter said: 'She had to pay the ultimate price for freedom.'

Revenge plot: Investigators say Haskell, pictured here with his ex-wife and three of their four children, went to his sister-in-law's home to try and get her to reveal the whereabouts of Melanie Haskell

Those who knew the Haskells have said that the couple had a rocky marriage, and that Melanie was desperate to get away from her husband who allegedly beat her in front of their children. 

Haskell pleaded guilty to simple assault in a domestic violence-related incident in 2008, according to Utah state court records.

Court documents show that both Hasekll's mother and sister had requested restraining orders against him following domestic violence incidents that took place in November 2013 and as recently as last week.
