Myuran Sukumaran's mother and sister have tearfully pleaded for him to be spared after they received official word he and Andrew Chan will be executed this month.

It comes after the Australian drug smugglers had their second bid for clemency officially rejected on Wednesday, dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad.

For two weeks, the families of Sukumaran and his co-ringleader in the 2005 Bali Nine plot, Chan, have walked silently in and out of Kerobokan jail for twice-daily visiting hours.

Australia's consul-general Majel Hind brought confirmation from Indonesian authorities on Friday that the execution will be carried out within three weeks.

Sukumaran's mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha left the prison feeling distraught as they spoke with reporters waiting outside.

Mrs Sukumaran pleaded for President Joko Widodo to spare her son and Chan.

'Please don't kill them, they are good children,' she said.

Brintha cried as she begged for her older brother's life.

'Please don't kill my brother, please,' she said.

'He's rehabilitated and we love him so much.

'Please don't kill him, please. Please.'

Brintha said her brother was doing everything possible to help people from behind bars.

'No one is listening to us, it's not fair,' she said.

'We don't have much time and he's scared. I can see it in his eyes, he's so scared.'

Earlier, expatriate Lizzie Love, who assists in Sukumaran's art classes, left the prison with one of his self-portraits and a portrait of a prisoner named Maria to be donated to charity.

The Filipina is ill and Sukumaran's paintings are funding her long-needed surgery.

Ms Love said it was one in a long line of kind acts for his fellow inmates.

'I just implore the president to please consider his position,' she said.

Mr Joko is refusing clemency to death row drug offenders regardless of their rehabilitation efforts.

An application for a judicial review that would have canvassed Chan's chaplaincy efforts and Sukumaran's successful art school - as well as past errors of law - was rejected this week.

But some of the inmates touched by the Sydney men have written their own appeals to Mr Joko.

One of them, Richo Richardo, said Chan was a selfless man who had insisted on paying for his medical care when he had no money.

'If your honour Bapak President still insists on executing Andrew Chan, I, Richo Richardo, as an Indonesian citizen, am ready to replace Andrew Chan to be executed.'

Indonesia's attorney-general is waiting for more prisoners on death row to be informed their request for clemency has been denied before setting an execution date.

There are already eight drug offenders in line for execution and he says he is waiting for 'more than three' others.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised to leave 'no stone unturned' in efforts to seek a stay of execution.

But on Friday, he appeared to be dampening hopes.
