They had been dating for less than three months but 39-year-old Dan Shearin made his 21-year-old girlfriend Breeana Robinson’s life hell, with her devastated family describing the convicted criminal as ‘not human… he’s the devil.’

The family of 'Bree', who died in January 2013, allege convicted Shearin is trying to seize Ms Robinson’s superannuation funds.

Shearin is allegedly claiming he and Ms Robinson were in a defacto relationship, despite only living together for 38 days before her tragic death.

‘I (am) really angry, especially with this court case going on and him pleading guilty to how he treated her,’ her mother, Elaine Robinson told A Current Affair.

‘But he’s still wanting to take her money. I’m disgusted.’

On Tuesday, Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail, after pleading guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass earlier this month. 

Cheerleader Breeana Robinson, 21, fell from the balcony of the Gold Coast high-rise apartment of her controlling, obsessive boyfriend, Dan Shearin, a court heard earlier this month.  

Shearin bombarded his girlfriend with 1439 text messages degrading, the last of which she received ten minutes before her death, which is thought to have been a suicide, a Southport Magistrate's Court heard earlier this month.

Ms Robinson’s grieving family are speaking out for the first time about the agony of the 21-year-old's death and their anger towards the man that ‘manipulated’ her. 

‘Bree had never heard of him before, he approached her on Facebook,' said her mother. 

‘He said that he was 28 with no children and worked in the cruiseline industry. 

‘He turned out to be 38, with a daughter and was packing shelves at Coles.’

The cheeleader, who was legally blind from a young age, had been drawn to the former cruise ship entertainer through his promises of helping her realise her dreams of a dancing career.

‘He manipulated, he told her everything she wanted to hear,’ explained Ms Robinson’s aunt, Janine Mackney. 

Less than two months after they started dating, the young girl moved in with the much older man, despite her family’s pleas. 

Her family had never trusted Shearin, but had no idea how twisted and abusive his behaviour could be, nor the shattering impact it was having on their beloved ‘Bree’. 

‘He called her a retarded s***,’ her brother Matt Robinson told A Current Affair. 

‘It’s just repulsive, you read it back now and it just makes you feel so guilty that you didn’t do more to stop it.’ 

Yet the response from the young girl to her boyfriend’s abuse was always the same and always heartbreaking: an apology, even if it wasn't her fault. 

Shearin’s past girlfriends have come forward, with the family disturbed to have received messages from 38 people telling sad stories about the nightmare they lived because of the same man.

Four years ago Trish (surname withheld) dated Shearin, and claims to have experienced a torrent of verbal abuse and foreceful behaviour.

‘His explanation for being like that was that he can’t win in a fight but he can kill anyone with this words,’ Trish told A Current Affair.  

Sonia, the mother of Shearin’s 19-year-old daughter, recalls being told 'really hurtful things' and that she began to believe them. 

She also alleges that Shearin threw her down the stairs. 

When asked if she surprised by Ms Robinson’s death, she tearfully admits, ‘no.’

Ms Robinson's family carried pink flowers into court on Monday to show their support for the woman

When Sheiran was convicted, friends and family of Ms Robinson attended court, wearing pink and handing out flowers of the same colour in support of the 21-year-old.

Supporters also carried pictures of the young cheerleader, who had dreams of becoming a dancer despite having been legally blind since a young age. 

In the 38 days Ms Robinson was with Shearin before she fell to her death he sent her 1439 text messages,At 10.35pm on January 29, 2013 after she returned from cheerleading practice Ms Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport.

The athletic, but slight, young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. 

The court heard evidence that in one text message sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin said: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'.

In another text message sent to Breanna that was heard in court, Shearin said: 'You're a complete f***ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c***'.

Shearin, who friends of Ms Robinson's said is obsessed with Facebook and dating sites, has called girls 'bitches' and a 'psycho' on another of his Facebook pages.

On September 21, he posted, 'Haha. I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection. One has set up an account on grindr with my phone number thinking that it might somehow embarrass me.

'Talk about psycho just coz she couldn't f*** me lol. She is so stupid that she doesn't realise that it is a criminal offence these days.'

Friends of Ms Robinson told Daily Mail Australia how the 'lovely young woman' who had struggled at school because of a chronic astigmatism called 'cat's eye', would have done anything to become a dancer.

'She believed Dan would help her achieve that goal,' the friend said, on condition of anonymity.

'She was the sweetest, kindest person, unaffected and always apologising,' the friend said.

Following Ms Robinson's death, Shearin moved from the H20 apartment block and is now believed to be working for a Gold Coast time share company.
