Four former employees of scandal-hit welfare-to-work firm A4E admitted swindling taxpayers yesterday.

The guilty pleas follow a police investigation into the troubled company which is paid more than £200m by the Government each year.

Julie Grimes, 50, Aditi Singh, 30, Bindiya Dholiwar, 27, and Dean Lloyd, 36, admitted dozens of offences of fraud and forgery.

All four were arrested after the Daily Mail revealed concerns about taxpayer-funded employment schemes run by A4E two years ago.

The company was employed by the Department for Work and Pensions to deliver an employment and training scheme called 'Inspire to Aspire'.

It pocketed huge sums from the public purse for getting people off benefits by delivering training and helping people to find work.

But Whitehall officials called in police over concerns that staff were billing taxpayers for 'successful' work that was not carried out or for non-existent clients.

A whistleblower claimed forged signatures and blank timesheets were 'routine' techniques used for bumping up the numbers of successful job placements.

The four former A4E recruiters admitted a total of 32 offences during a hearing at Reading Crown Court yesterday.

The A4E controversy began in February 2012 when it was revealed that its founder Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6 million

Grimes, of Staines, admitted nine charges of forgery. Singh, of Slough, who is seven months pregnant, admitted two counts of forgery and one of fraud.

Dholiwar, of Slough, admitted seven counts of forgery. Lloyd, of Milton Keynes, admitted 13 offences of forgery.

A fifth former employee was stranded overseas by poor weather and her barrister indicated that she too intended to plead guilty at a special hearing next week.

All the offences took place between over four years until February 2013. No date has been set for the former employees to be sentenced. They each face up to 10 years in prison.

The A4E controversy began in February 2012 when it was revealed that its founder Emma Harrison had paid herself £8.6 million.

Damaging allegations followed that workers at the firm were inappropriately claiming 'success' fees, sometimes for individuals who worked for no more than 24 hours.

Officers from Thames Valley Police's economic crime unit searched its headquarters in Slough, Berkshire, as politicians called for a full inquiry.

The furore forced Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, to step down as chairman and resign from her role as David Cameron's 'back to work tsar'.

Mrs Harrison remains the majority shareholder after building up the company, formerly called Action For Employment, into an operation spanning 11 countries.

Her boasts that she can find jobs for the long-term unemployed have won her a string of lucrative Whitehall contracts over the past 20 years.

A4e is one of several contractors which earn payments for helping the out-of-work find a job. Half of its work is subcontracted to charities, generating millions in management fees.

A further eight former A4E employees, aged between 25 and 43, are expected to go on trial in October accused of fraud.
