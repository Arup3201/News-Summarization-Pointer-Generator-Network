Verdict: Theodore Wafer stares straight ahead after being convicted of second-degree murder and manslaughter as his attorney Cheryl Carpenter comforts him on Thursday

A jury convicted a suburban Detroit homeowner of second-degree murder and manslaughter on Thursday in the killing of a drunk, unarmed woman on his porch last year, rejecting his claim that he was afraid for his life and had acted in self-defense.

Theodore Wafer showed no emotion as he was convicted of shooting Renisha McBride in the face through a screen door on November 2, hours after she crashed into a parked car a half-mile from his house.

No one knows why she ended up at the Dearborn Heights home, although prosecutors speculated that the 19-year-old woman may have been seeking help.

'She just wanted to go home,' prosecutor Patrick Muscat said during closing arguments, holding the shotgun Wafer used to kill McBride. 'She ended up in the morgue with bullets in her head and in her brain because the defendant picked up this shotgun, released this safety, raised it at her, pulled the trigger and blew her face off.'

In addition to the murder conviction, 
the jury also convicted Wafer of voluntary manslaughter and a felony 
firearm charge and he was immediately taken into custody.

He faces a life term in prison as a result of his guilty verdict at his sentencing on August 21.

McBride's parents, Monica and Walter Simmons said that they were pleased with the verdict.

They added though, that they wouldn't be here if he had just dialled 911 that morning.

'Me and Walter know who she was,' McBride said of her daughter. 'She was not violent. She was a regular teenager...Her life mattered.'

Wayne County Judge Dana Hathaway warned that she would lock people up for any outbursts, and the courtroom was silent after the verdict was read.

McBride's mother, Monica McBride, cried and clasped her hands as if praying when the jury's decision was announced. She gave long hugs to prosecutors as the courtroom emptied.

Wafer, who had been free on bond, was ordered to jail to await his sentence. He faces up to life in prison on Aug. 21, but it's likely his punishment will be much shorter.

Guilty: Theodore Wafer testifies in his own defense during the seventh day of testimony for the November, 2013, killing of Renisha McBride earlier this week

'He was a cold-blooded killer. ... People have a right to bear arms, but you need to do it with reason and responsibility,' McBride's father, Walter Simmons, told reporters.

The Wayne County jury of seven men and five women heard eight days of testimony before beginning deliberations. Wafer, 55, could face up to life in prison with the possibility of parole, but it is likely his actual sentence will be much shorter.

Wafer, an airport maintenance employee who lives alone, said he was roused out of sleep around 4:30 am by pounding at his front and side doors. He testified that the noises were 'unbelievable.'

'I wasn't going to cower in my house,' said Wafer, who has denied all accusations that race played a part in the tragedy from the start.

He said he thought there could have been more than one person outside of his 1,100-square-foot home near the Detroit-Dearborn Heights border. Wafer said he pulled the trigger 'to defend myself. It was them or me.'

'He armed himself. He was getting attacked,' defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors. 'Put yourselves in his shoes at 4:30 in the morning.'

But prosecutors said Wafer could have stayed safely in his locked home and called 911 instead of confronting McBride.

'He had so many other options. ... We wouldn't be here if he had called police first,' Muscat told the jury.

Prosecutors earlier said that Wafer became the 'judge, jury and 
executioner,' as he urged jurors to convict 
him of second-degree murder of Renisha McBride, an African American woman.

Prosecutors
 in their closing arguments repeatedly emphasized that Theodore Wafer 
had easier options than to directly confront 19-year-old Renisha McBride
 when she showed up drunk on his porch before dawn on November  2.

Several 
hours earlier, she had crashed her car into a parked car on a Detroit 
street about a half-mile from Wafer's house in Dearborn Heights.

Wafer,
 55, said he shot McBride in self-defense.

He said he awoke to an 'unbelievable' pounding on his doors and feared for his life when he 
fired through a screen door as someone rushed from the side of the 
porch.

He shot McBride in the face, killing her.

'She
 was a young girl looking for help,' prosecutor Patrick Muscat told 
jurors. 'What he did had to be immediately necessary and it wasn't. It 
was reckless. It was negligent. I don't know how to describe it. It was 
horrific.

'How about 
shutting the door? ... How about calling 911?' Muscat said. 'No, what he
 does is he engages. He creates the confrontation.'

Jurors
 went home after deliberating about three hours Wednesday.

They asked to
 look at the clips that held the screen, but Judge Dana Hathaway said no
 because the clips weren't admitted as evidence.

Wafer,
 an airport maintenance worker who lives alone, is charged with 
second-degree murder and manslaughter.

The jury chose not to convict him of the
 lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and did clear Wafer of all charges.

'He
 armed himself. He was getting attacked,' defense attorney Cheryl 
Carpenter said in her closing argument. 'Put yourselves in his shoes at 
4:30 in the morning.'

But another prosecutor, Athina Siringas, said a murder conviction fits the case.

Wafer 'decided to be judge, jury and executioner,' she said in a rebuttal argument.

Earlier
 this week, Wafer testified that he was terrified by the pounding on his
 house. He had been sleeping in a recliner and said he couldn't 
immediately find his phone to call police.

In
 the aftermath of the shooting, some wondered whether race was a factor 
because Wafer is white and McBride was black.

Race hasn't been an issue 
at trial, although the prosecutor noted that McBride was 'African-American' while cross-examining Wafer on Tuesday.

In
 her closing remarks, Carpenter said race isn't a factor for the jury.

She said Wafer was just a homeowner who was aware of crime in a 
neighborhood that borders Detroit and wanted to protect himself.

'In
 the heat of the moment our instincts are to survive,' she said.

'He did
 not know it was a 19-year-old who got in a car crash at 1 a.m. What he 
knew was someone was trying to get in. It's not for a good reason — it's
 to hurt me.'
