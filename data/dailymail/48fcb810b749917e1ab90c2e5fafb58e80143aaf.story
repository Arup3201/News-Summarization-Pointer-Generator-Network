There have been times in the past five years, particularly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when turning on the TV pushed Steven Gerrard to the limit.

Liverpool’s captain is a football fanatic who never misses a chance to sit down at home and watch a game. But, at various points since December 9, 2009 — the date his club relinquished a place among Europe’s elite — Gerrard has found viewing the Champions League almost intolerable.

‘When you aren’t involved, there is a big jealousy,’ Gerrard admits. ‘I was jealous of the teams and players who were involved when Liverpool had nothing to do it with it. But that’s a good thing, isn’t it? It’s the best competition to play in at club level. There’s a hole there when you are out of it.’

The Champions League is back and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is eyeing glory again

It is why, when he leads out Liverpool against FC Ludogorets on Tuesday evening, Gerrard will savour the occasion a little more than usual. Not so long ago, a meeting with unremarkable opponents from Bulgaria would have failed to quicken the pulse but absence has increased Liverpool’s fondness.

For a period under Rafael Benitez, Liverpool were regulars at the business end of this tournament, which explains his position when talk turns to what adventures this campaign may unearth.

Gerrard’s message is clear: returning to the Champions League has provided a colourful narrative but it is not the summit of ambitions.

‘Maybe you forget how lucky you are,’ he says. ‘When you are consistently getting to the latter stages and popping up in finals, it was such an unbelievable achievement. But I’ve got confidence that might not be too far away, if the owners continue to back (manager) Brendan Rodgers as they have done.

‘I’ve got a lot of confidence in Brendan and in the squad. Listen, I’ll put it another way. If we go out in the group stages, or the last 16, we will be majorly, majorly disappointed. We want to progress. We want to go as far as we can. This can’t be a one-off. This can’t be, “Isn’t it great where we are?”

‘This isn’t a reward for finishing second last year. I don’t see it as a reward. This is where Liverpool should be — and should be consistently. It’s the responsibility of myself and the players to give it our best crack. It is important that we have got the Champions League next year as well.

‘The players who haven’t sampled this and then get a taste of it — once they have had that taste I know they are going to love it. Hopefully, it will drive them on to want to keep it at Liverpool for a long time to come.’

Those who have not experienced those great European nights need only look at Gerrard to see what big performances at this level can do for a reputation. It is, after all, 10 seasons since he immortalised himself when leading a crusade that culminated spectacularly in Istanbul when Liverpool fought back from 3-0 down to win on penalties.

What happened that night in the Ataturk Stadium is never far from chatter on Merseyside — Gerrard last week attended the premiere of a new comedy film set around the Champions League final against AC Milan — but does he ever think about what may have occurred had the comeback not taken place?

‘I can’t help but think about when Andriy Shevchenko decided to dink his penalty,’ says Gerrard, rewinding to the climax of the shootout that Liverpool won 3-2. ‘If he had put his laces through it or smashed it in to the corner, maybe I’d be sitting here talking about playing in two losing European Cup finals.

‘I know I was going to be our fifth penalty taker but maybe I could have missed? They are the small details at this level. It is the decision-making from big players in big moments. If he hadn’t dinked his penalty, the pressure on me would have be humongous. Who knows what would have happened?’

There is a pause as he thinks about it for a moment but then he quickly moves on. Istanbul might be his defining moment but he doesn’t dwell on it — ‘I can do that when I hang the Predators up’ — and the appetite to add more chapters to his and Liverpool’s story is as strong as ever. Negotiating a group which also contains Real Madrid and FC Basle is the first priority and if this inexperienced squad is to do that — Gerrard has made 129 European appearances for Liverpool, the rest of the squad’s combined total for the club is 153 — Anfield must live up to its reputation.

‘We understand that we are not one of the favourites,’ he says. ‘There are some big hitters that people will be tipping to win it, but the message from me, as captain of this team, is that we are not making up the numbers. No way.

‘We have got such a big advantage over two legs, with Anfield, that other teams haven’t got. Let me tell you right now: you come to Anfield, you’re getting a terribly hard 90 minutes. And we are going to make it even harder for you.’

But how will they do that? They have struggled to replicate the blitzkrieg starts of last season so far and life without Luis Suarez is still causing adjustments.

However, the stage is set for someone to take over his mantle and Gerrard hopes it will be the man who has been entrusted with the No 45 shirt.

Mario Balotelli might split opinion but he is already the subject of a banner on The Kop and Gerrard, in quiet moments at the Melwood training complex, has told the Italian where he could be propelled if he scores the goals to give Liverpool back their Champions League season ticket.

‘There is no doubt Luis Suarez is going to be one of the big players in the Champions League this season,’ Gerrard says. ‘I know how much he wants to play in the competition. I had many conversations with him about it. But we have got Mario now and we have got to move on.

‘If we get the best out of him, we have got him. If people want to write stories about him and say that he is crazy or he is a nutter, let them. But he is one of us now. We have welcomed him into this clubs with open arms and we want to help him succeed. Everyone is hoping he is going to be a hit. He has got a great set of team-mates who will work for him and back him. He has got to do the same for us.’
