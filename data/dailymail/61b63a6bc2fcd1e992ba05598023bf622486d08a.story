He hadn't kicked a ball in 14 years, and that became pretty clear when Nick Grimshaw ended up in hospital with torn ligaments and damaged tissue in his left foot on Monday.

The BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show presenter was playing a one-off match to celebrate Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day, where he led a team against Olly Murs's men at St George's Park.

But what started as a fun time on the field turned into a painful nightmare for Nick, 28, whose battered foot has meant the DJ had to miss his show on Tuesday morning.

Ouch: Nick Grimshaw had to miss his breakfast show on Radio 1 because of injuring his foot during a football match on Monday

According to Scott Mills - who is covering the show - Nick was given a lot of painkillers by doctors to ease his discomfort, but it is recommended that the injured person rest for a couple of days without putting pressure on the injury. It can take up to 6 weeks or more for the foot to heal in these situations.

The BBC issued a statement saying: 'Nick injured his foot playing 
football yesterday against Olly Murs’ side and Scott Mills filled in for
him today on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show. We expect Grimmy to be back on
air tomorrow [Wednesday].'

The day before the match, Nick had tweeted: 'Our first foot all match tomorrow VS @ollyofficial. I've just let my teammate @Chris_Stark know that I haven't kicked a ball for 14 years.'

But it all started so well with

live during his morning show on Radio 1.

They experienced a range of activities 
including reactions training on the Batak machine, strength and 
conditioning training and sprint training on the underwater treadmill.

celebrate the beautiful game in The FA’s 150th anniversary year.

Following
in the footsteps of the likes of England stars Steven Gerrard, Wayne 
Rooney, Steph Houghton and Rachel Yankey – Nick and Olly were treated 
like professionals and put through their paces by the expert trainers at
St George’s Park.

Sadly for Nick he didn't just get battered, but his team too who lost to Murs's five 11 - 1 after 30 minutes.

Olly said: 'It’s been great working with The FA as an ambassador for its 150th anniversary so I was delighted to be able to pull a few strings and arrange this game against Nick at St George’s Park.

'I think the boys were inspired by playing at St George's Park. The performance was exceptional and we're delighted to get the win.'

'Days like today are why I love football – I’d encourage people to get involved with the Sir Bobby Robson National Football Day on Saturday 10th August and celebrate the nation’s favourite game in their own way.'
