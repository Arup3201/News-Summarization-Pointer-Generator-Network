David Cameron is to attend a meeting of the secretive Bilderberg Group tonight - but will not say who he meets.

The Prime Minister will take part in a debate on the global economy with an unknown group of ministers, business leaders and academics from around the world.

But his attendance at the heavily-guarded event is certain to spark controversy after Mr Cameron once promised to lead the 'most open and transparent government in the world'.

Secret: David Cameron, pictured in Scotland today, is to attend the Bilderberg Group conference tonight, but Downing Street said it was a private meeting and will not say who he meets

Cunning plan: American protestor and Radio DJ Alex Jones sailed a protest barge right through the security zone at the Bilderberg group meeting, which attracts controversy every year

Showdown: Alex Jones and other protesters mocked security guards encircling the hotel where the conference was taking place

Famous for being shrouded in secrecy,
the Bilderberg conference is taking place in Britain for the first time
since 1998 and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot 
world domination.

The huge police operation drafted in to 
monitor the four-day event in Watford, which has previously attracted mass 
demonstrations, could cost the British taxpayer as much as £2million or 
more, it has been claimed.

Mr Cameron is not due to give a speech but will take part in a discussion about 'domestic and global economic issues'.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is a private meeting. He has been invited as head of the government here.

'My understanding is that is is usual for the Bilderberg Group to invite the head of the government of the country in which it is meeting.

'He feels it is an opportunity to discuss economic issues with senior ministers, business people and academics.'

Disruption: Alex Jones protesting from his barge, challenging security measures surrounding the event

Unusual tactics: Because the conference is so secretive, conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination

Controversy: Protesters gathered to at vehicles arriving at the conference yesterday in protest at its secretive nature

'Outrageous': The huge police operation drafted in to monitor the four-day event, which has previously attracted mass demonstrations, could cost the British taxpayer as much as £2million or more, it has been claimed

On guard: Police patrol the grounds of The Grove hotel which is hosting the annual Bilderberg conference

Security: A police helicopter hovers over the The Grove hotel in Hertfordshire, with the taxpayer paying for most of the bill

The spokesman said he thought it was the first time Mr Cameron had joined a meeting of the shadowy group. But as Tory leader he attended in 2008.

The Prime Minister has made great play of his commitment to be more open about who he meets.

In 2010 he promised: 'We want to be the most open and transparent government in the world.'

Downing Street was forced to deny that Mr Cameron's decision to attend this evening ran counter to his pledge.

The spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister has always been clear about the importance of transparency, which is why this Government has taken  a number of steps in terms of publishing more data, more information and making details of meetings available.

'We publish far more information on meetings than previous governments. The Prime Minister regularly has meetings with key ministers from other countries and with business people and others as part of his job.

'That doesn't mean that he is not determined to lead the most transparent government.'

Campaigners: Amid tight security, members of the press and a handful of protesters gathered in a fenced-off area just inside the grounds of the hotel, but around half a mile from the redbrick hotel

Sweep: Police are seen to be doing security checks in bushes outside the hotel grounds

Since its inception in 1954, Bilderberg  has held annual gatherings of 120-150 invited political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media, designed to 'foster dialogue between Europe and North America'.

The group describes the conference as 'a forum for informal, off-the-record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world' and states that the private nature of the meeting allows participants to 'listen, reflect and gather insights' without being bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed public positions.

There is no detailed agenda, no resolutions are proposed, no votes are taken, and no policy statements are issued.

Cloaked: Famous for being shrouded in secrecy, the Bilderberg conference is taking place in Britain for the first time since 1998 and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination

Ring of steel: Police officers man a road block as delegates arrived for the four-day meeting

Several
cars with blacked-out windows entered the gates of the Grove Hotel, 
near Watford, in Hertfordshire, have been seen arriving the secretive meeting.

It
is thought billionaire executives from multinational companies such as 
Amazon and Google, high-ranking political figures including Chancellor 
George Osborne, senior minister Ken Clarke and shadow chancellor Ed 
Balls and even members of royal families are among the 130 or 
so attendees.

Downing Street refused to comment on the huge police operation surrounding the event, which has been heavily criticised.

Watford town mayor Dorothy Thornhill 
said: 'I think it's outrageous that the local taxpayer has to pick up 
the tab for ostensibly a private meeting of trillionaires, probably the 
most wealthy people in the world.

'Hertfordshire Constabulary have 
suddenly got this unexpected budget strain dumped on them at literally a
month's notice. It's not on.'

Alert: Police on horseback patrol the area around the hotel as delegates arrive for the conference

Keeping watch: The traditionally secretive conference, which has taken place since 1954, is expected to be attended by politicians, bank bosses, businessman and European royalty

Hertfordshire Police has not revealed details of the bill, but they are in talks with the Home
Office about a grant for 'unexpected or exceptional costs'.

This is only approved if expenditure 
threatens a force's budget, which would need to be more than one per 
cent of its overall spend - or about £1.8million, according to the Daily
Telegraph.

Hertfordshire Police said the 
Bilderberg Group has agreed to contribute some of the cost of security, 
but taxpayers will have to cover the rest.

A
spokesman added: 'We will also be seeking funding from other sources to
help cover the costs of policing and are in discussion with the Home 
Office about other funding sources.'
