A tainted batch of bootleg alcohol has killed at least 143 people with hundreds more being treated at  hospitals in villages outside the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.

Day labourers and other poor workers began falling ill on Tuesday evening after drinking the brew, which was laced with methanol.

Police have arrested ten suspected people in connection with making and distributing the toxic alcohol around the village of Sangrampur, about 20miles south of Kolkata.

Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of the state of West Bengal, has promised a crackdown.

She said: 'I want to take strong action against those manufacturing and selling illegal liquor.

'But this is a social problem also, and this has to be dealt with socially also along with action.'

The deaths came days after more than 90 people were killed in a hospital fire in nearby Kolkata that led to the arrest of the facility's directors for culpable homicide.

The latest tragedy began when groups of poor labourers finished work and bought cheap homemade booze for about 10 rupees (12p) per half litre, less than a third of the price of legal alcohol.

The men were drinking along the 
roadside near the railway station when they began vomiting, suffering 
piercing headaches and frothing at the mouth, district magistrate Narayan Swarup Nigam said.

Bodies are lain on the ground before being transported to morgues. Police have arrested four people in connection with making and distributing the toxic alcohol

Furious villagers ransacked the illegal alcohol shops.

Zamir Sardar's 32-year-old uncle Jahangir Sardar, a leather cutter, passed away this morning.

Mr Sardar said: 'He drank the alcohol late in the afternoon yesterday. We didn't realise his health was deteriorating.

'In the morning, his condition seemed very unusual, he cried out in pain. Then we brought him to the hospital as soon as we could, but he passed away within a couple of hours.'  

Half-conscious patients were carried into hospitals on stretchers, and treated on the floor due to lack of beds.

Cheap
bootleg alcohol kills dozens of people every year in India. In 2009, at
least 112 people died from a toxic brew in western India.
