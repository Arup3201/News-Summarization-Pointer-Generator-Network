The parents of Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe, who was abducted and killed in 2003, have told how a meeting with the parents of Madeleine McCann gave them strength during their toughest times.

In an interview with Today on Wednesday morning Denise and Bruce Morcombe spoke of a dinner they shared with Kate and Gerry McCann during a holiday to England in July 2011.

The McCanns' daughter Madeleine vanished from their holiday apartment at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007. She has never been found.

'You know it was really just like looking in the mirror', Mr Morcombe revealed.

Gerry McCann, Kate McCann, Denise Morecombe and Bruce Morcombe met in England in 2011 and the Morcombes said it was incredible how well they got along 

'[They were] truly ordinary people and it was amazing how quickly we communicated even though that was the first time we'd ever met,' he told host Karl Stefanovic

Mr Morcombe also revealed that during the meal the two families compared their experiences with media, police, 'the frustrations of no news' and how they dealt with everyday life and commitments.

'We sat down and had dinner and about three or four hours later it felt like five minutes had passed and they were really lovely people,' Mrs Morcombe said.

The two families had been in contact for many years before through email, but the dinner was their first encounter face to face.

On Today the Morcombes also told of how proud and excited they were for the upcoming wedding of their son Bradley, Daniel's twin brother, and revealed how they dealt with their grief and the unknown.

Mr Morcombe said it was too easy to wake up each day feeling anger, and said it was much more beneficial for he and his wife to put their energy into helping others.

'It was much better to get up every day and try and do something positive', Mrs Morcombe added.

On Tuesday the Sunshine Coast couple launched a book which details their ordeal over the past decade, titled Where Is Daniel? The Family's Story.

Daniel was abducted and murdered on December 7 2003, but it was not until March of this year his killer, Brett Peter Cowan, was found guilty of the crime that the Supreme Court Judge at the sentencing branded 'entirely abhorrent'.

Denise and Bruce Morcombe told of how proud they are of their sons, and released a book about Daniel's disappearance on Tuesday

He is survived by two brothers, Bradley and Dean, and Bruce Morcombe said they are incredibly proud of their boys.

'I think we've done a pretty good job - They've both got nice girls and both got their own homes and good job and they've turned out pretty well,' he said.

Daniel's remains were discovered in 2011 around the time his killer was charged. The whereabouts of Madeleine still remain a mystery.
