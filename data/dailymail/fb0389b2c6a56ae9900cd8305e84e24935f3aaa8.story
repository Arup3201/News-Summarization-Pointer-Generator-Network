Borne along under a canopy of snow white feathers, this fluffy cygnet took to the water yesterday heralding the start of summer.

The little bird hitched a ride on its mother’s back as she glided across the water at Abbotsbury Swannery near Weymouth, Dorset, where the first hatching is said to signal the beginning of the season.

Half-a-dozen cygnets were yesterday getting used to their new surroundings in glorious bank holiday sunshine. They are the first of around 500 due to hatch at the swannery between now and the end of June.

Newborn: The newly-hatched baby cygnets at Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset. Their arrival is said to mark the start of summer

New surroundings: The newly-hatched baby birds explore the world for the first time. Around 500 will be born there before the end of June

Newborn: The swannery is home to the world's only managed colony of mute swans, a tradition that goes back to when Benedictine monks looked after them there in the 11th century

Abbotsbury has the only managed nesting 
colony of mute swans in the world. Up to 600 return each year to raise 
their young.

The Benedictine monks who owned the swannery until the 
1540s believed the arrival of the first cygnet signalled the first day 
of summer.

The first hatching this year happened at 7.45am on May 16, three weeks 
later than last year when the first cygnet emerged in April – the 
earliest since records began in 1393.

The cygnets have been placed in rearing pens so they can learn to swim 
in a sheltered spot. About 100 breeding pairs of swans have produced 
around 500 eggs on 100 nests; one pair has produced ten eggs alone.

Swanherds feed the adult swans twice a day on wheat grains while the 
cygnets are fed three times daily on chick crumb, a crushed pellet full 
of protein.

As the birds basked in the sunshine, the bank holiday weather proved to 
be mixed across the country.

Thousands flocked to beaches and parks as 
temperatures in Norfolk, Suffolk, London and Essex edged up to highs of 
64.2F (17.9C), but there was up to an inch of rain across the South 
West.

Much of the country will face wet weather and cooler temperatures for 
the return to work today. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said that 
tomorrow it would be cloudy across many areas with heavy downpours in 
some places, adding: ‘The rest of the week is looking fairly unsettled.’

On Sunday motor sport fans could be seen enjoying the sunshine at the Superbike World Championships at Donington Park in Leicestershire, but it was a different story for revellers at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Londonderry, with many getting a soaking as they watched their favourite music acts.

Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts 
said: 'The south-east will stay dry and fine today as will parts of the 
Midland, but further west it is a different story and in Wales and 
south-west England it will be wet.

'Temperatures
will be in the high teens today - 17C, 18C or maybe 19C - but further 
west we will be looking at temperatures in the mid teens.

The rest of the week is likely to bring widespread cool and unsettled weather - with temperatures expected to peak in single figures in the south-west.

In Dorset, two teenage boys risked their lives climbing up an enormous rockfall on the same stretch of coastline where a woman was killed by falling rocks.

The two boys climbed more than 30 metres up the huge mound of chalk rock less than a month after it piled onto the beach between Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door.

Visitors to the beach shouted at the boys after they sent loose rocks tumbling down the cliff face onto the beach below.

They eventually came down off the landfall after 20 minutes of climbing.

Danger: Two foolish teenage boys scramble up the rocks putting their own lives in danger between Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door

Last year 22-year-old holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman was tragically killed when 400 tonnes of falling rocks fell on her at Burton Bradstock to the west of Durdle Door.

Coastguards today reissued a warning to stay clear of rockfalls along the coast.

A coastguard spokesman said: 'We are very disappointed people are still ignoring the warnings. They are gambling with their own safety.

'These are very unstable cliffs and this year has been worse for landslips than previously. 'Climbing up a recent landslip which hasn't yet settled is just asking for trouble.

'Not only does it endanger the person climbing but also the people on the beach below.'

Danger: The two boys can be seen high up the cliff face. Their actions have been condemned by the coastguard
