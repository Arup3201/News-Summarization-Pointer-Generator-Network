Chelsea and Brazil star Willian seemed thrilled to be heading off to international duty with his 'homies' Oscar and Filipe Luis on Monday morning.

The Blues trio all featured in Chelsea's 3-2 Premier League victory against Hull on Sunday before catching an early morning Eurostar train to Paris where the Selecao will face France on Thursday.

Willian, sporting a leather jacket and sunglasses, took to Instagram to share the snap along with the message: 'Left for Paris with my homies'.

Both Willian and Luis started for Jose Mourinho's side on Sunday, as the west London club gave away a two goal lead before a Loic Remy strike sealed a crucial three points ahead of the international break.

Oscar replaced fellow Brazilian Ramires early on in the second half, putting an end to a bad week for the latter after missing out on a place in Dunga's squad for Brazil's friendly matches against France and Chile.

Dunga took command of the Brazil team for the second time in July, just days after Brazil were dumped out their own World Cup 7-1 by Germany and has won all six of his matches in charge so far.

Chelsea's boys from Brazil will be hoping to grab their final chance to impress in a yellow shirt as the March fixtures will be the last before Dunga announces his squad for the Copa America in Chile in June.

Goalkeepers: Jefferson (Botafogo), Marcelo Grohe (Gremio), Diego Alves (Valencia)

Defenders: David Luiz (Paris St Germain), Marquinhos (Paris St. Germain), Thiago Silva (Paris St Germain), Miranda (Atletico Madrid), Filipe Luis (Chelsea), Danilo (Porto), Fabinho (Monaco), Marcelo (Real Madrid)

Midfielders: Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Elias (Corinthians), Souza (SÃ£o Paulo), Fernandinho (Manchester City), Philipe Coutinho (Liverpool), Willian (Chelsea), Firmino (Hoffenheim), Oscar (Chelsea), Douglas Costa (Shakhtar)

Forwards: Neymar (Barcelona), Diego Tardelli (Shandong), Robinho (Santos)
