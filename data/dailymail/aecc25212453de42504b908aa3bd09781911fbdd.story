A pilot who ejected from a US fighter jet moments before it smashed to the ground radioed a colleague to say: 'Dude, I'm getting out'.

The pilot bailed out of his $30million F15-D fighter jet, from RAF Lakenheath, at 6,000ft before the aircraft crashed into a field just yard from houses near Spalding, Lincolnshire, last October.

Documents on the crash show he ejected after the plane went into a flat spin, where the aircraft rotates on its belly making almost impossible to recover from, at 15,000ft.

Crash: The pilot radioed to say 'dude, I'm getting out' moments before bailing out of this $30million F15-D above a field in Lincolnshire, bringing it down just yards from some houses

A technical sergeant, who was sitting in the back seat of another jet, said he was left 'very shaken'.

In transcripts of an interview he gave investigators, he said: 'After 6,000ft, number 2 [the pilot from the crashed jet] basically said 'Dude, I'm getting out'.'

The information was revealed in documents released after a BBC Freedom of Information request.

An Accident Investigation Board report into the crash is yet to be released.

The MOD's clean-up bill for the crash was last week revealed to be £393,235. The USAF will cover 75 per cent of the cost.

The pilot, who had been on a training exercise at the tie, escaped the accident with minor injuries.
