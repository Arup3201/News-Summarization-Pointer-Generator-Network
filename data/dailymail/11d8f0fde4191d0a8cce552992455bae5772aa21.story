This week, five sellers parted with arguably Sydney and Melbourne's most glamorous and sought after properties. 

From ocean-front views, to infinity pools, to exquisite open-plan outdoor entertaining areas, these stunning properties are worth taking a look at. 

Set in Castlecrag, this first property is near the top of the list, selling in excess of an impressive $3.33 million.

Bought by the previous owners in 2007 for just over $3 million, this property was renovated by one of the owners who works as an interior designer.

Stand out features of the property include the stunning ocean-front views and the indoor-outdoor flow of the bottom level.

Agent Lynette Malcolm from Chadwick Real Estate, Turramurra, said that the owners loved the feel of the house and the views of the water.

RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne have seen double digit growth in house prices over the past year.

'Over the latest growth cycle we have seen Sydney dwelling values increase by 27.2 per cent,' said Mr Lawless.

This Moore Park Road Property tucked away in Paddington has a long and colourful history, making it's sale last week for $3.082 million all the more extraordinary.

Built in the mid-1800's as a farm house, this magnificent property known as 'Verulam' was converted in 1873 into a gentleman's residence and then bought in 1924 by the Hade family.

A member of the Hade family was the seller of this property, meaning that it had stayed in the family for 90 years.

During World War Two, the cellar of the house was used as an air bomb shelter for the family, which agent Louise Snowden from Raine and Horne Double Bay said she had never seen before.

The daughter of the original owner, known affectionately as 'Aunty Toots' passed away at the end of 2013 at the age of 98, and had lived in the house almost continuously for 90 years.

The family said that they remember playing in the original stables as children, a feature which remains on the property. 

The stunning property sold at auction last Thursday.

'Sydney and Melbourne were also the strongest performing cities during the 2009/10 growth cycle. Since the beginning of 2009, we have seen values rise by a cumulative 50.1 per cent and 46.1 per cent respectively in Sydney and Melbourne.

Robert Larocca, auction market spokesman for RP Data, told Daily Mail Australia: 'This is the best start to Spring we have had since 2010, it is very good.

'We have got a really strong Sydney market and a very healthy Melbourne market and that is where most of the examples are across Australia.

'The state of the market will be of no surprise to people who have been following it.

'The clearance rates we are seeing are not dissimilar to last year, 80 per cent is very strong and to see it continuing is a the sign of a very strong market.

'Sellers price expectations are being regularly exceeded, that will encourage more home-owners to put their homes on the market.'
