Read his views on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior

Graeme Swann has blasted Kevin Pietersen's autobiography as a 'work of fiction' and that any criticism of his former England team-mate Matt Prior is 'codswallop'.

The ex-England spinner, who took 255 wickets in 60 Tests, claims he 'expected' KP: The Autobiography to be about as factually correct as Jules Verne - a French novelist who specialised in science fiction.

Pietersen dubs Prior 'The Big Cheese' and dedicates a whole chapter to the wicket-keeper, claiming his vice-captaincy reign was one of terror and intimidation.

But Swann has laughed off Pietersen's claims and believes Prior was one of the few people who actually wanted the South African-born Englishman to remain in the side.

Swann, speaking at Lord's during a NatWest award ceremony for grassroots cricket, said: 'I expected it to be the biggest work of fiction since Jules Verne and that seems to have happened. The one thing I will say is I immediately realised it was codswallop when I read the character assassination of Matt Prior.

'Tragically I don't think Kev realises the one person who fought tooth and nail to keep him in the side is the one person he is now assassinating: Matt Prior.

'Kevin has been quite clever because the guys still playing he has left alone and he hopes to get back in again one day. He has picked on people who he thinks can't answer back. If that (bullying) was the case a lot of people would have flagged it up before. We had a magnificent team ethos and team spirit until Mitchell Johnson took his blindfold off and then it all fell apart.'
