Cold War warrior: Ferguson Smith, a spycatcher who brought down some of the USSR's deadliest spies

A decorated Second World War pilot who went on to hunt Soviet spies selling nuclear secrets during the Cold War has died at the age of 98.

Ferguson Smith, a former Bomber Command flight lieutenant, spent 36 years in the Special Branch, tirelessly rooting out agents who stole the nation's nuclear secrets during the paranoid and fearful 1950s and 60s.

During his incredible career he was also a bodyguard to the Duke of Windsor, the former king, when he visited the UK following his abdication.

His most high profile scalp was George Blake, a double agent who worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service and in 1955 and gave British secrets and details of agents to the KGB, crippling MI6's operation behind the Iron Curtain.

He was also instrumental in breaking the Portland Spy Ring, which was selling British nuclear sub secrets to the USSR, as well as capturing traitorous naval attache John Vassall and Klaus Fuchs, the German physicist who exchanged details of Britain and America’s atomic weapons programme to Moscow.

Neil Root, an espionage expert, said the British public owe a debt of gratitude to Smith, who would have had to be 'brutal' to achieve his aims.

'There was a real fear of Communist spies in the 50s and 60s.

'At the time espionage and counter espionage were about face to face contact, it was all meeting in dirty macs on park benches. It was much more psychological, you had to be able to read people.

'The things you see in James Bond now, that was the kind of stuff happening then. It was much more brutal, people were killed much more quickly,' he told the Daily Mirror.

Mr Root said George Blake was a deadly adversary who employed violence and bloodshed to achieve his nefarious aims. Hundreds of spies were killed in the line of duty thanks to Blake breaking their cover.

It was a sting orchestrated by Smith in 1961 that led to Blake's capture. He was jailed for 42 years but escaped and fled to the USSR in 1966.

Smith was born in 1914 in Aberdeen and was the son a grocer. He joined the police and moved to the Special branch in 1936.

He joined the RAF in 1941 and flew Lancasters equipped with radar-jamming equipment - a perilous role as the aerial made the aircraft a favourite target of the Luftwaffe. In an assignment that did not reward failure, he survived 30 missions.

He was awarded a medal for rescuing two fellow airmen from fighters over Berlin despite being heavily injured.

Red menace: John Vassall, a former Admiralty clerk who was jailed for 18 years for spying. He was a British civil servant who, under pressure of blackmail, spied for the Soviet Union

Upon rejoining the Special Branch in the aftermath of the war, he spied on radicals like fascist leader Oswald Mosley and the explorer Laurens van der Post.

Smith also protected VIPs, including the former king, who he once bluntly turned down a cash reward from, stating: 'I don't take tips'.

In 1996 he was Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and running Special Branch.

As well as Blake, the Portland Spy Ring and Fuchs, he also caught John Vassall, who worked as an aide to a Civil Lord of the Admiralty. He was gay and Russian agents used this to blackmail him into stealing thousands of classified documents.

After retiring in 1972 Smith, a poetry lover, lived quietly with his wife, Margaret, until her death in 2003.

The Portland Spy Ring was a group of Soviet spies operating in England from the late 1950s until 1961 when the five main members of the network were arrested by the British security services.

The spy ring was caught after MI5 launched an undercover investigation after being tipped off by the CIA that information was being leaked to the Russians from the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, England, where the Royal Navy tested equipment for undersea warfare.

Suspicion fell on Harry Houghton, a former sailor who was a civil service clerk at the base, as his extravagant living expenses were far beyond his meagre salary.

MI5 put Houghton under surveillance and also watched his mistress, Ethel Gee, a filing clerk who handled documents Houghton himself did not have access to.

They often went to London, where they would meet a man identified as Gordon Lonsdale, a Canadian businessman. During these meetings Lonsdale and Houghton exchanged packages and MI5 also put Lonsdale under surveillance.

They discovered Lonsdale often went to visit antiquarian bookseller Peter Kroger and his wife Helen at their home in Ruislip, northwest London, and the couple were also put under close but discreet watch.

In January 1961, Houghton, Gee and Lonsdale were arrested by Special Branch Detective Superintendent George Gordon Smith — as MI5 officers are not authorised to make arrests.

Gee's shopping bag contained huge amounts of film and photographs of classified material, including details of HMS Dreadnought, Britain's first nuclear submarine, and the stalling speed specifications of the Borg Warner torque converter.

Smith and two colleagues then went to Ruislip to see the Krogers. They found microdots, the photographic reduction of documents in order to make them small enough to be smuggled more easily, hidden inside Mrs Kroger's handbag.

The microdots found at the Krogers' home were letters between Lonsdale and his wife, who lived in the USSR with their children.

Kroger had used the print in his antique books to hold the microdots and smuggle them between Britain and Russia. These would have also held the intelligence secrets passed on by Houghton and Gee.

After an extensive search, spying equipment was found inside the home. This included large sums of money, fake passports, photographic material, code pads for coding messages and a long-range radio transmitter-receiver for communicating with Moscow.

Large amounts of money were also found in the homes of Houghton, Gee and Lonsdale.

Two days after their arrest all five were charged with espionage at Bow Street Magistrates Court.

Their trial began on Monday 13 March 1961 and the jury returned verdicts of guilty for all of the accused.
