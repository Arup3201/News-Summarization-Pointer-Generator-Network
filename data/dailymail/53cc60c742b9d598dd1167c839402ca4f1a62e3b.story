A group of Muslims were detained at Orlando Sanford International Airport because they asked for a cup on board a plane.

According to the Orlando Sentinel the captain of Allegiant flight No.625 from Allentown, Pennsylvania, radioed ahead of landing and asked for airport police to meet the plane.

A number of Muslims were reportedly lingering in the lavatory and asked for a cup which aroused suspicion among airline staff.

Questioning: Police were called ahead of landing to meet the plane because a Muslim man had asked for a cup which had aroused suspicion

Police met the aircraft when it landed on Wednesday evening at about 8.30pm local time.

An FBI agent was interviewing three men into the night but they were later released without charge.

Airport director Larry Dale said: 'In today's world, we'd rather be cautious.'

Misunderstanding: It is thought that the man asked for a cup in order to clean himself

About six adults and one child were traveling from Pennsylvania to Central Florida for a volleyball and badminton tournament, Dale said.

It has been reported that airline company Allegiant requested that police respond 'in reference to Middle Eastern passengers' but it is thought that the travelers are of Indian descent.

Muhammad Musri, president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, said devout Muslims customarily clean their private parts with water after using the toilet in a procedure is known as istinja.

He explained that this is probably what the passengers were doing when they asked for a cup. He said: 'They (airline staff) didn't understand.'
