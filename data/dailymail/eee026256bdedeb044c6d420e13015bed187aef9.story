Impressed: Jordan Henderson was full of praise for Liverpool team-mate Lazar Markovic

Familiar: Lovren could make his competitive debut against Southampton on August 17

Henderson told Liverpoolfc.com: 'I thought he was brilliant. It's his first game and he gelled really well. He kept getting the ball, taking players on; he looked really lively so I think he'll be delighted with his game.

'He's very creative; he's great with the ball, playing one-twos and (making) runs in behind all the time so he's a great threat for us going forward, especially on the counter-attack. He's a great signing and a great plus for us.'

And the Liverpool midfielder has revealed he's impressed with another of the club’s major summer signings after Dejan Lovren completed his move north from Southampton.

He added: '(He's) another brilliant signing. We've done some really good business in the summer and he's a top defender.

'I've spoken to Adam [Lallana] and Rickie [Lambert] about him and they say he's a brilliant defender and a great player, so he should be a great addition to the squad.'
