Several Oregon players are facing team discipline after celebrating their Rose Bowl win Thursday night by mocking Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston and allegations of sexual assault that have followed the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner the past two years.

Video taken from the field as Oregon celebrated its 59-20 win in the College Football Playoff semifinal showed at least three players chanting 'No means no!' to the tune of a chant used by Florida State fans.

The video shows running back Kadi Benoit, linebacker Torrodney Prevot and a third player wearing a WON NOT DONE shirt participating in the chant.

The short video was uploaded to Vine by Bear Heiser of Fox Sports West, who said the video was taken on the field as Oregon players celebrated the win from a podium.

He shared a longer, 27-second video that showed the chant initiated somewhere off-camera, with the players in the shorter video, as well as wide receiver Chance Allen, joined in.

Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said in a statement  that the behavior was inappropriate.

'This is not what our program stands for, and the student-athletes will be disciplined internally,' Helfrich said.

Winston was never charged after a woman accused him of raping her in 2012, and was recently cleared of violating Florida State's student code of conduct.

The case was the focus of a major New York Times piece, that pointed out some rather shocking details about how the incident was handled.

The victim, a freshman at the school, showed signs of trauma after reporting the rape and was later found to have had semen in her underwear.

Despite the trauma and the presence of fluids however, no investigation was ever done into the incident by local police or the University.

What's more, Winston, who was immediately named by the victim as her rapist, was never given a DNA test and was not interviewed for two weeks. 

And so, despite the trauma and semen, the local prosecutor announced he lacked the necessary evidence to charge Winston and the case was dropped.

Winston would go on to win the Heisman trophy the following year. 

In the day's other big bowl game,  Ohio State defeated Alabama 42-35 at the All State Sugar Bowl.
