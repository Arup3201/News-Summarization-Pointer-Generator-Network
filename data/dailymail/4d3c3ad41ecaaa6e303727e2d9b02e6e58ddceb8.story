A dolphin was lethally shot
by a hunting arrow in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the second
violent killing of the protected animal in recent weeks, federal
authorities said on Monday.

The dolphin, with a yellow-feathered arrow embedded in its
side, washed ashore on Orange Beach, Alabama, over the weekend,
according to a news release from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whose law enforcement
officers are investigating.

Preliminary results from a necropsy indicate that the
dolphin may have survived with the arrow for at least five days
before dying of an infection caused by the wound, NOAA said.

The agency also is investigating the death of a pregnant
bottlenose dolphin found on Miramar Beach, Florida, last month
after being shot in the lung.

The dolphin was within weeks of giving birth, according to a
news release in that death.

Authorities are seeking additional information in both
cases. Harming, harassing or feeding a wild dolphin is
prohibited under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

NOAA officials said they have seen a rise in violent
killings of dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with at
least 17 dolphins stranded, or beached in shallow water, with
gunshot wounds since 2002. The majority of these deaths have
occurred in the past four years.

People can help to protect dolphins by refraining from
feeding them, which encourages them to approach dangerous
situations, NOAA said, noting they will remove bait and catch
directly from fishing gear. This can result in violent
retaliation.
