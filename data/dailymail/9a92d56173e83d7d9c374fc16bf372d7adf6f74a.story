Two long-lost brothers were reunited by chance after discovering that they attended the same school and had become best friends.

The two boys - Thiago Lima dos Santos, 12, and Lucas de Lim Alves, 14 - were in the same year group, spent break times together and played football together in Sao Mateus, Brazil, unaware that their bond was more than just friendship.

It was only by chance that their school head teacher made the discovery that the boys shared a mother after they had been separated from a young age due to ther illness. The teacher described it as ‘something out of a soap opera’.

Lucas had grown up with his father and stepmother while Thiago had been raised by his paternal grandmother in another town just 15 miles away in south east state of Espirito Santo.

Their mother reportedly suffered health problems and was unable to look after them.

Lucas had been told he had a long-lost brother three months ago and was desperate to find him.

Lucas told Brazil’s A Gazeta newspaper: ‘I got really down when I found out. I wanted to find him to talk with him, play with him and be his friend.’

Lucas confided in the school's head teacher, Deuseli de Souza, 40, who tried to help for him by searching through the register of names at other schools in the region, but had no luck.

Then fate seemed to step in. Thiago moved to Sao Mateus two months ago and enrolled at the Joao Pinto Bandeira college, the same school Lucas had been studying at for the past three years.

They fast became good friends and only by chance that Ms de Souza discovered the two were brothers.

She said: ‘Lucas' story stuck in my head.

‘One day the geography teacher left a pile of coursework on my desk. One of them was by Thiago Lima, who had just enrolled in school.’

Ms de Souza said she called both of them separately and asked each for their mother's name.

She said: ‘To find out how close they were to each other was a surprise and an immense coincidence. 

‘With their families' permission we introduced them to each other.

'It was like something out of a soap opera.’

Thiago said: ‘At the start I was really confused, I didn't know how to act. 

‘Now we spend more time together and talk a lot. 

‘We're going to spend the weekends at each other’s houses. 

‘I'm liking my new brother very much.’

Lucas said: ‘It's all very new, we're starting to trust in each other and becoming even closer friends.’

Thiago's grandmother, Janira dos Santos, 62, said: ‘I'm thrilled to see my grandson's happiness in finding his brother. 

‘He knew he had a brother, but never imagined that one day he would find him. I thank God for this.

‘I've got to know Lucas and he's very polite. I hope they'll become the very best of friends.’
