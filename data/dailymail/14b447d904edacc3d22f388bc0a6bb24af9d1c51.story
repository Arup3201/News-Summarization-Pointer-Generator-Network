Bogus whiplash claims cost every motorist an extra £118 on their annual car insurance bill, it has been revealed.

Premiums have risen by 80 per cent since October 2008 due to the rise in people making costly – and often false – whiplash claims, according to a report by insurance company Aviva.

The average legal fee for a whiplash claim is £2,500, almost half of which is due to intermediaries, including claims management companies and personal injury lawyers, seeking a cut for themselves.

The researchers said that if insurers handled claims directly rather than through these third parties, an estimated £1.5billion could be stripped from UK motor insurance premiums.

As a result, industry leaders say it should be a legal requirement for personal injury (PI) claimants to contact the ‘at fault’ insurer directly rather than going to intermediaries such as claims management companies and PI lawyers.

Aviva estimates that handling claims directly will halve the current cost of dealing with the 600,000 whiplash claims made every year.

This reduction alone could lead to premium falls of around £60 a year for the average driver.

Dominic Clayden, claims director at Aviva, said: ‘Our figures for average compensation settlements show that dealing with an insurer directly results in at least as much compensation for the claimant and has the advantage of being quicker, meaning their treatment and rehabilitation can start almost immediately.

‘It would also prompt a significant reduction in the costs of the current system which would benefit all UK motorists, who will begin to see a reduction in their premiums.’

There has been a 70 per cent rise in personal injury claims from road accidents in the past six years.

The Association of British Insurers believes that more than a quarter of whiplash claims are fake – but an estimated £2billion is paid in compensation every year.

Spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: ‘It’s almost the fraud of choice for too many people.

‘While some are genuine, we think many are fraudulent.

‘The problem is it’s very difficult to establish whether you have whiplash injuries.’

The findings follow reports last month that police forces have received millions of pounds for passing on the details of road accident victims to claims management companies, insurers and lawyers.

This may have led to thousands of people being pursued by ‘cash for crash’ companies looking to profit out of personal injury claims, fuelling the rise in third party involvement.

Aviva’s report, called ‘Road to Reform: Reducing Motor Premiums by Reforming the Personal Injury Claims Process’, has been launched ahead of the Ministry of Justice Whiplash Consultation, which will close on March 8.

The study found that 63 per cent  of the 2,000 drivers surveyed think that people seek compensation to get money to spend on whatever  they choose rather than for rehabilitation.

Research: Only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy according to Aviva

Previous research by Aviva found that only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy, while a third said it was used to pay off household debt, 12 per cent to buy luxury items such as TVs and 9 per cent to go on holiday.

More than 50 per cent of those surveyed supported the introduction of an independent panel of medical experts to assess whiplash cases.

Research also revealed 95 per cent of people believe unnecessary claims are behind premium increases, with 93 per cent naming the rise in whiplash claims specifically.

The average cost of car insurance reached £1,000 for the first time in July last year, according to the AA – more than double that of the price of a typical policy four years ago.
