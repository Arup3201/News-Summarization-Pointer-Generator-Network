An aggressive new strain of HIV has been identified, scientists have warned.

A new study found the strain, called CRF19, is capable of transforming from an infection to full-blown aids within just three years.

That is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years - and can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected.

Scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in Cuba suffering a rapid progression to AIDS, within three years of infection.

Experts say the new strain, identified in Cuba, causes patients to progress to AIDS within three years - so rapidly they may not even realise they have been infected. (Image shows a mature HIV virus infection spreading inside the body)

HIV tests often do not detect the virus within the first few weeks of infection, sometimes months.

Once a person develops the flu-like symptoms that characterise acute infection - usually coming two to four weeks after infection - the virus undergoes a latency period.

During that time the virus replicates and lives inside the body, but does not cause any symptoms.

That period can last between five and 10 years before AIDS develops, in most cases.

But researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium noted the CRF19 strain causes patients to make the transition to AIDS much faster.

It can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected. 

Researcher Professor Anne-Mieke Vandamme told MailOnline: 'Cuban clinicians were asking us to collaborate with them to investigate why they were noticing an increase in patients progressing to AIDS much faster than before.

'We set up this  project and found that a particular recombinant strain, called CRF19, was strongly associated with fast progression. 

'All patients infected with CRF19 were progressing to AIDS within three years after being infected - often as soon as they were diagnosed with HIV infection.  

'We know that they were infected just one or two years earlier, since we have an HIV negative test from the patients in the study one or two years earlier. 

'All these patients are offered treatment immediately, but some patients are at diagnosis so ill that they die before they can recover with treatment.'   

Before the HIV virus can enter human cells, it has to attach itself to them.

It does so via anchor points, which are proteins on the cell membrane - the coating of every cell that separates it from the outside environment.

In a normal infection, the virus first attaches itself to the anchor point known as CCR5.

A new study found the strain, called CRF19, is capable of transforming from an infection to full-blown aids within just three years. That is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years

But in many patients, after experiencing many healthy years during their latent period, the virus then switches to another anchor point, known as CXCR4.

It is that switch which tends to trigger a faster progression to AIDS.

Researchers at the University of Leuven noted this new strain of the virus targets the second anchor point, CXCR4, early after infection.

As a result the number of healthy years a patient experiences is drastically shortened, and a person will start to suffer the effects of AIDS much faster.

Professor Vandamme, and an international team of scientists, studied the blood samples of 73 recently-infected patients.

Fifty-two already had AIDS at diagnosis, while 21 had yet to see their infection move into the later, more serious stage.

They compared these results with blood from 22 patients, who had progressed to AIDS after a normal healthy period living with HIV, of around a decade.

Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk.

There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs.

The pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide.

But research published in July by the United Nations showed AIDS-related deaths worldwide dropped to 1.5 million last year, from 1.7 million the year before.

That was the sharpest annual decline since the epidemic's peak in 2004

and 2005 - and marked a 35 per cent drop from the 2.4 million deaths in both those years.

New infections also fell to 2.1 million last year, down 38 per cent compared to the 3.4 million in 2001.

But with more than half of the 35 million people with HIV unaware they are infected, the battle is far from over however, warned Michel Sidibe, head of UNAIDS - the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. 

In those patients infected with the new strain of HIV, researchers found abnormally high doses of the virus, and of a defensive molecule known as RANTES.

The molecule is part of a person's natural immune system response, and acts to join itself to CCR5, to which most forms of HIV have to attach in order to enter the body's cells.

The high concentration of RANTES suggests that most of the CCR5 were not available as anchor points for HIV.

This, the scientists believe, may have caused the virus to bypass that first anchor point, instead going straight to the second, CXCR4.

Their finding that all study patients who were infected with the new HIV variant, went on to develop AIDS within three years of infection supports the theory.

Professor Vandamme said while the strain was first noticed in Africa, it only appears to be spreading in Cuba, where records so far show 144 infected.  

'Since the study, we are aware of in total 144 patients being infected with this recombinant virus, probably much more,' she said.

'This recombinant virus originated in Africa but we are not aware that it is spreading there, we do see that it is spreading slowly in Cuba. 

'So far it has not been noticed elsewhere.'

Professor Vandamme, added: 'The worrying thing about this strain is that patients often get diagnosed with HIV infection and already have AIDS.'

She said the majority of current treatments are equally effective against this new strain.

One drug, though, which works by blocking the CCR5 anchor point, is not effective because the strain bypasses the anchor point. 

'There are however sufficient other options for those patients, as long as they start treatment early enough,' she told MailOnline.

'So for patients infected with this aggressive CRF19, it is key to get tested early in order to start treatment early.

'That is in fact true for all HIV infections, but it is more crucial for this CRF19.

'In general, it is essential for individuals engaging in risky behaviour to get tested often, so that they can start treatment as early as possible.'
