This week, China presented its toughest and bravest women to the world.

The country's first ever female SWAT team, known as 'Snow Eagle', was unveiled on Wednesday in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, according to the People's Daily Online. 

The crack team of female soldiers has been trained by the Chinese border police before they were picked to form the specially-created division.

'To pull out the gun, I only need 0.3 seconds and then make the first shot in another 0.3 seconds,' said Liu Siqi, who is the team's top marksman and has served in the border police for four years.

Miss Liu said the shooting skill is the result of continuous training for at least six hours every day all through the year.

She has already fired over 10,000 shots during three years of training.

'When I had really good shooting scores, sometimes full scores, I would be so thrilled,' said another member, Mi Xue. 'I would take the target sheet back to my dorm and pin it on the wall. I would smile whenever I see it.'

The 34 members all sport the same 'basin' haircut and wear bright-red berets, which has earned them the nickname 'Little Red Caps'.

Intense training: Members have gone through continuous training on shooting for at least six hours every day

Special force: The team is set to be tasked with responding to any emergency situations in times of possible future terror attacks

During their inauguration ceremony this week, the women demonstrated a series of combat and shooting skills.

They also showed a softer side and performed music to the media with a zither and ukulele after training.

According to Chinese media, the team will conduct further training camps and be tasked with responding to any emergency situations including terror attacks.

'Snow Eagle' is based in China's troubled far west region, Xinjiang, where ethnic conflicts between Uyghur and Han have caused unrest in the past.

Zhang Chunxian, the Communist Party Secretary of the autonomous region, confirmed this week there have been individuals from Xinjiang travelling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, reported the People's Daily Online.

The provincial capital Urumqi witnessed a major riot in July 2009, which involved at least 1,000 Uyghurs and left 197 dead, according to Chinese media.
