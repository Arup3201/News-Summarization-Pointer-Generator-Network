Crouching down to speak to a young child with a friendly hand on his back, Vladimir Putin must have thought that he had been gifted a perfect PR opportunity.

But as the Russian President stood up the boy was left with such a look of terror etched on his face that many have been left wondering - what exactly did Putin say to the child?

Whatever he uttered, the words clearly made their mark on the youngster.

Guess the words: After Vladimir Putin had spoken to the young boy during a Christmas Eve service a look of horror was etched on his face, leaving many to ask what exactly the Russian president said to the child

The boy's wide-eyed expression has sparked a slew of speculation online, as web users have tried to guess the politician's words.

Naturally, the suggestions have all bordered on the ridiculous, with one user on Reddit suggesting that Putin had made a Star Wars-style declaration, telling the boy: 'I am your father.'

Among the whimsical suggestions are 'I'm not Vladimir Putin, the real one is dead' and speculation that he told the child he had killed Santa Claus.

The pictures were taken as Putin attended an overnight Christmas service on January 7 at Trinity St. George Monastery in Sochi, Russia.

Despite the boy's initial horrified expression, he was later pictured looking nonplussed.

Christmas falls later for Orthodox 
Christians in the Holy Land, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox churches.

They use the old Julian calendar instead of the 16th-century Gregorian 
calendar adopted by Catholics and Protestants and commonly used in 
secular life around the world.
