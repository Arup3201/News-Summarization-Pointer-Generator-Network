A father-of-two shot dead in front of horrified drinkers in broad daylight was 'murdered by mistake', it was claimed today.

An associate of victim Marlon O'Reilly, who did not wish to be named, said he was killed by mistake outside the Dovecote pub in the Cockshut area of Birmingham on Friday evening because he was wearing a T-shirt similar to the intended target.

It is believed West Midlands Police are probing local claims Marlon was not the intended target of the gunman - who arrived at the pub on a quad bike and escaped before armed officers arrived. Mr O'Reilly was pronounced dead at the scene.

His friend said he believed the shooting had been opportunistic and organised just minutes before the fatal execution-style killing.

He said: 'There had been an altercation earlier that day at a gym. But Marlon wasn't present when that happened.

'The bust-up at the gym was just the latest incident in a long-running feud between a large family and somebody who they thought had disrespected them.

'Marlon met up with the man we think was the intended target later that evening at the Dove Cote pub.

'It seems someone on a quad bike drove by the pub and spotted Marlon and his mate through the pub window from outside.

'Marlon and his mate were both wearing white T-shirts. The word is the spotter on the quad bike put a call in to the killers to say their target was wearing a white T-shirt.

'But when the killers walked in the intended target had nipped to the loo.'

Devastated friends have been paying tribute both online and at the scene and also believe Mr O'Reilly was not the intended target.

Writing on Facebook, 50 Shades of Birmingham said: 'This was a guttless (sic) act by some gutless idiot. '

'Marlon was a pal of mine and I know everyone says "He was a top bloke" but he really was.

'This shooting was a case of mistaken identity and whoever done it would be better handing themselves in than getting found.

'Truly gutted. RIP Marlon and my thoughts are with all his family, his young kids, Mom and Brothers xx.'

Floral tributes were also laid at the scene. A card on one read: 'Marlon, you will never be forgotten, always in our hearts and thoughts.'

Another read: 'Goodnight, God bless' with another mourner addressing their card 'to "my brother" Marlon'.

A solitary black balloon displayed the words: 'A true gent - RIP.'

A woman who lives opposite the pub but 
declined to be named said she had seen a man make off from the pub on a 
moped just after the shooting happened.

She said: 'I saw a bloke leave the pub, then he got on this bike and went.'

Another
resident, who also did not wish to give his name, added: 'There are a 
lot of wild rumours flying around about it right now.'

Inspector Derek Packham said: 'Marlon was enjoying a Friday evening drink with his friends when he was shot.

'We continue to establish the events that led to his death and we are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen Mr Oâ€™Reilly yesterday.

'We are currently investigating a number of lines of inquiry and have conducted house to house, forensic searches of the scene and continue to trawl CCTV for clues, but we still need people to come forward.

'Family liaison officers continue to offer support to the family at this sad time.'

Police had earlier said they were treating the incident as a targeted attack.

Chief Superintendent Alex Murray 
said: 'We believe this may have been a targeted attack which happened in
a busy pub in broad daylight this afternoon.

He added: 'This would have been a shocking incident for witnesses and will have a huge impact on the local community.

'I
want to reassure residents that we are working hard to find the person 
responsible for this attack and are following a number of lines of 
inquiry at this early stage.

He told reporters: 'There were reports of shots being fired in the pub.

'Officers attended the pub and found a man who had been shot.

'First aid was administered, paramedics were in attendance and our firearms officers came.

'Unfortunately that man has now died.

'Because of that, our sincerest sympathies go out to his friends and his family.'

The Dovecote pub where the shooting happened at 5.45pm is run by national chain the Stonegate Pub Company.

A spokesman for Stonegate said none of the staff had been hurt in the incident.

In a statement released on behalf of the company, it said: 'We confirm an incident took place at the Dovecote, Birmingham.

'This is currently being investigated by the police and we are assisting them with their enquiries.

'The pub is currently closed and (will) remain so while the investigation continues.'

Anyone with information is urged to contact West Midlands Police on 101.
