Gabrielle Giffords and her family have revealed how the tragic shooting in January of this year healed the rift that had simmered between her and her two teenage stepdaughters.

As Giffords struggled to form full sentences in at television interview last night, the Congressowman's stepdaughters Claudia and Claire told how the tragic afermath of the attack gave them a 'second chance' to bond with their father's new wife.

The Diane Sawyer interview with Giffords and Mark Kelly was the congresswoman's first full interview since the January shootings that killed six people and wounded 13.

Giffords said she would not be returning to congress until she is 'better. She struggled to respond to a question about whether she would return to Congress, saying 'No, Bette' before husband Mark Kelly finfished her sentence.

'She wants to get better' he said.

Giffords
appeared alert and happy on the show, but admitted the rehabilitation 
has been 'difficult' and that there is still a long way to go.

The
41-year-old is alert, curious and her intellectual skills are clearly 
still there, but she spoke in halting sentences as she tried to get the 
words out.

Despite Giffords's struggle to summon the words, her speech therapist believes there is plenty more progress to be made.

It was revealed in the programme that Mark Kelly's daughters Claudia and Claire were cold and indifferent towards Giffords after she married him in 2007.

The girls admitted in the show that they regretted not being closer to the stepmother before the shooting.

Kelly touched on the subject in the new book In their new book Gabby: A Story Of 
Courage And Hope, writing: 'Gabby tried her best to connect with my
kids. They wouldn't be rude. They just weren't receptive.'

When Giffords tried to engage them in conversation, they just shrugged and were even unresponsive when their new stepmother bought them gifts.

Giffords eventually told her husband: 'I understand. They're kids and I love them. I'm patient. I'll wait for them to come around.'

But the shooting changed everything. Kelly and his daughters were in Houston, where they lived full-time, when Giffords was holding her meet and greet event at a store in Tuscon, Arizona.

When they heard of the shooting, they immediately flew to be by her bedside.

The girls had never seen their father cry before.

After two years of giving Giffords a hard time, Claudia, then 16, wrote: 'You are the strongest, most incredible woman I have ever met.

'I love you so much. I am thankful to have you in my life.

'I know we have not been extremely close in the past couple years and I am really sorry. That is going to change immediately.'

From that moment, the girls did everything they could to show Giffords they loved her.

Claudia said on tonight's show: 'I took Gabby for granted for so long, and I'm lucky I got a second chance to build a relationship with her.'

In May, four months after she was shot, Giffords was well enough to leave her rehab center for a Mother's Day dinner with Kelly, his daughters, and Giffords' mother.

She showed up at the restaurant with gifts for her own mother from her and Kelly.

But she was also met with a pleasant surprise - Claudia and Claire joined them for dinner, showering Giffords with cards and gifts.

It was a first for the girls and for Giffords and another turning point in their relationship.

It may have taken a tragedy to bring Giffords and the girls together, but it made the girls realise how lucky they'd been to receive a second chance, Kelly writes.

He said: 'We didn't fully know it, but we'd all been very lucky, and lucky to have each other. We see that clearly now.'

In tonight's show Giffords said she will not return to Congress until she is 'better.' She struggled to form a sentence and replied, 'No. ... Better' when asked if she wanted to return to Congress.

She moved her hands in front of her mouth as if needing to form the words and said, 'Better, better.' Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, completed the thought for her, saying, 'She wants to get better.'

The show also featured video documenting the 10 
months of progress since the 
horrific Tucson shooting.

The couple credits much of her recovery to music, as footage shot by her husband shows her singing such songs as Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Free Falling by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with hospital personnel.

Her brown hair has grown out since it 
was shaved in May for surgery to repair her skull and she was wearing a pale green top with 
gold buttons and dark eyeglasses.

The programme also showed footage of Giffords as she tried to walk again for the first time and how even music helped in her protracted recovery process.

ABC said its special presentation 
was broadcast in conjunction with tomorrow's release of Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
