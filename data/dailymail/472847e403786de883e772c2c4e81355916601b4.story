Need for Speed is back and there’s a next-gen engine under its hood. Powered by Frostbite 3, Need For Speed Rivals is coming to Xbox 360, PS3, PC and the new Xbox One and PS4.

Developed by EA’s newest studio - Ghost Games - and Criterion, in Rivals gamers play as either a cop or racer, where each side of the law has its own set of high stakes challenges, rewards and consequences.

Welcome return: Ferraris will be featuring in the series for the first time in seven years

As a racer, the goal is to become infamous for taking risks behind the wheel and capturing your most intense escapes on video for the world to see.

The more cops players evade, the more Speed Points they collect, enabling them to unlock new cars and items.

As a cop, players work together as part of a team in pursuit of racers, earning prominence and rising in the ranks of the Police Force with every bust.

Achieving higher ranks unlocks new police only cars and more powerful pursuit tech.

Excitingly, Ferrari has returned to the series for the first time in seven years. Gamers will be able to get behind the wheel of their exotic cars, including the F12berlinetta.

At the heart of Need for Speed Rivals is AllDrive, an innovative new online feature that allows gamers to seamlessly transition from playing alone, to playing with friends, eliminating the line between single player and multiplayer.

Drivers can also customize their car with performance and aesthetic upgrades, and there are 11 gadgets ranging from turbo boosts to EMPs that can be deployed.

Powerhouse: Expect plenty of luxury cars and high-speed chases in this latest Need For Speed

Need for Speed Rivals is coming to Xbox 360, PS3 and PC on November 19, 2013.

Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions are out later this year.
