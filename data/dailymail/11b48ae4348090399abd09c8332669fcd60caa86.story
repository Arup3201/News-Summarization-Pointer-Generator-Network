Former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler has revealed she is contemplating writing a tell-all book about her relationship with President Francois Hollande.

The 48-year-old made the comments during a two-day-long humanitarian trip to India earlier this week after the French President ended their relationship.

Speaking to Parisien Magazine, in an interview to be published on Friday, she said: 'I do not rule out writing a book.'

It comes after the President of France effectively sacked her as First Lady on Saturday with a curt 18 word statement.

Trierweiler wryly added the short statement amounted to nearly one word 'for each month together since his election'.

She also claimed she was 'more disappointed than angry' about the break-up which came after Hollande was accused of having a two-year affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41.

Trierweiler admitted to magazine Paris Match that she felt like she was 'falling from a skyscraper' when she first found out about Hollande's affair.

She first said it was ‘like being hit by a high speed train’ and checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from stress.

Then, on a charity trip to India, she blamed 'low blows', 'betrayals' and 'back-stabbing' for the break-up.

Trierweiler says it is unlikely she will return to her career as a political journalist as covering stories about Hollande would be too complicated.

She instead plans to launch a career as a humanitarian campaigner.

Meanwhile, the Socialist president’s staff have now completely eradicated some 130 images of Ms Trierweiler from the official Elysee website, along with all other references to her.

Mr Hollande, who has never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor president’ for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside the Elysee.
