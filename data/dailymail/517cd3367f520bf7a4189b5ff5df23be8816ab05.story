A petition is urging Israeli airline El Al to stop ultra-orthodox Jew passengers 'bullying, intimidating and discriminating against women'.

The petition, which at the time of writing has 1,500 signatures, comes after passengers aboard an El Al flight from New York's JFK to Israel recently caused a delay after hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff, saying they cannot sit next to women.

It's been organised by Sharon Shapiro from Chicago, who wrote: 'If a passenger was being verbally or physically abusive to airline staff, they would immediately be removed from the plane.

A petition is urging Israeli airline El Al to stop orthodox Jew passengers 'bullying, intimidating and discriminating against women' 

'If a passenger was flouting the rules for take-off, thereby causing flight delay, they would immediately be removed from the plane.

'If a passenger was openly engaging in racial or religious discrimination against another passenger or flight attendant, they would immediately be removed from the plane.

'Why then, does El Al Airlines allow gender discrimination against women? Why does El Al Airlines permit female passengers to be bullied, harassed, and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by El Al Airlines? One person's religious rights do not trump another person's civil rights.'

Recently, passengers aboard an El Al flight from New York's JFK to Israel caused a delay after hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff

Haredi Jews are a stream of Orthodox Jews characterized by their rejection of mainstream secular culture. 

Haredim regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews and although this claim is contested by other streams of Judaism, it is a perception which is often held in wider Jewish and non-Jewish society.

The disrupted flight from New York to JFK was transporting Israeli and Jewish passengers, including some ultra-Orthodox Jews, to the Holy Land in time for the start of the Jewish New Year.

However, many of the male Jews refused to sit next to other female passengers prior to the takeoff.

The tactic not only delayed the flight, but also went onto cause chaos on board.

'People stood in the aisles and refused to go forward,' said Amit Ben-Natan, a passenger who was on board the plane. 

'Although everyone had tickets with seat numbers that they purchased in advance, they asked us to trade seats with them, and even offered to pay money, since they cannot sit next to a woman. It was obvious that the plane wouldn't take off as long as they keep standing in the aisles.'

Passengers claimed that despite the El Al flight crew informing travelers that they did not have to agree to switch, the plane's captain announced the flight would not be going anywhere until everyone was seated.

'It was an 11-hour long nightmare,' one of the passengers said.

Galit, another traveler on the flight, said the ultra-orthodox passengers suggested she and her spouse split up to better accommodate their desired seating arrangements: 'Why should I agree to switch places?' she said with anger to Shalom Life. 

After she refused, the ultra-Orthodox man known as a Haredi ended up swapping with her after he continued to stand in the aisle as soon as the plane had taken off.

Haredim regard themselves as the most authentic custodians of Jewish religious law and tradition which, in their opinion, is binding and unchangeable. They consider all other expressions of Judaism, including Modern Orthodoxy, as deviations from God's laws

Many passengers have reported that after takeoff a large portion of the travelers took to the aisles to pray which causing them to become crowded and flight attendants unable to serve drinks or distribute meals. 

El Al has responded to the claims and promised to look into the issue.

It said: 'El Al does everything it can to give its passengers the best possible service year-round. Our crews on the ground and in the air are doing the best they can to address the needs and requests of all our travelers while trying not to fall behind schedule

'The company will examine the complaints and if some passengers are found to have acted out of line we will examine its future steps.'

Ms Shapiro believes pre-booked segregation is the answer.

She said: 'If El Al Airlines wants to truly accommodate all of its passengers, it will reserve a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight, where for a fee, those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take-off to change seats with them - thereby avoiding arguments, bullying, and delayed take-off.'
