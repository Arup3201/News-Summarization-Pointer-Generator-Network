Fast and furious, it is the Olympic sport that boils down to hundredths - even thousandths - of a second.

So when your country is hosting the Games and everyone is looking at you to deliver the golds, every fraction you can gain is crucial.

That's why Britain's track cycling team will be kitted out with a top secret weapon in the velodrome this week - battery-powered, self-heating 'hot pants'.

Victoria Pendleton is among members of the British track cycling team who will wear the self-heating shorts during the Olympics

Sir Chris Hoy will also benefit from the technology, which has been in secret development for 18 months

Pendleton is going for three golds at London 2012 and believes the new technology will help her gain an edge

Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and every member of the squad will sport individually-tailored and high-tech heating shorts before racing to gently warm theri leg muscles to the optimum temperature for success.

While the other nations will be haring round the track and getting tired as they complete their warm-ups, the Brits will be gently toasting their thighs.

The shorts - immediately and inevitably nicknamed the 'hot pants' by the British team - have been kept under wraps for the last 18 months, a secret collaboration between Adidas, British cycling and Loughborough University.

The technology has the potential to change track cycling - and potentially other sports - forever.

Quick release zips will allow the riders to rip off the shorts in a flash as they jump on their bikes before the start of the race, safe in the knowledge their muscles are at an optimum 38C.

The technology was so secret that 
designers didn't dare risk trialling it at the World Championships in 
Melbourne earlier this year for fear someone might copy the technology.

But
now the Games have started, the secret has been revealed - with members
of the team saying the 'hot pants' leave them 'ready to race.'

Pendleton,
hoping to win gold in the individual sprint, team sprint and keirin, 
said: ‘The hot pants, as they’ve been nicknamed by the team, help us 
keep warm during events.

'We can just put them on any time we’re in the 
middle, which means we don’t have to go on the bike as much.

‘We’ve had them for a couple of months
now, since the worlds. We’ve been trying them out in training. They’re 
really good to use.

'They heat up almost instantaneously, you feel the 
temperature on your quads and hamstrings, and it really makes the 
difference.

‘As a sprinter I
have lots of short events spread out through the day so it’s essential 
that my muscles maintain temperature.

'The zips mean you can take them 
off, literally at the last minute.  You can actually  cycle in them too,
I’ve tried that.

‘As a team we talk about marginal 
gains a lot. You’re making sure that every tiny detail is taken care of,
finding every advantage possible to make things run smoothly.’

Hoy added: ‘I have definitely been feeling the benefit. As soon as you get them off, immediately before you do your standing start or flying effort, your legs feel like they are ready to go. You feel like you did at the end of the warm-up but not out of breath or fatigued from it. It gets you in the optimum state for competition.’

The shorts run from the calves to the quadriceps and work in a similar way to tyre warmers in Formula One.

A lightweight battery slots into the pocket at the back and, at the flick of a switch, heats a series of filaments which run over specific muscle groups.

Esme Taylor, a psychologist with the British cycling team who worked on their development, said: 'I think this will become part of track cycling. Especially after seeing how athletes have taken to wearing them.

'They see these as part of their warm-up now... and for us that shows how good they are.'
