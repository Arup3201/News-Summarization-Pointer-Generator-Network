A Las Vegas-based animal charity is celebrating after recently sending its 1,000th rescue dog to Canada to start an exciting new life with pet lovers north of the border.

The usual arrangement was the brainchild of Everett Croxson, who launched Foreclosed Upon Pets International (FUPI) after learning about a serious problem with unwanted pets in his native Las Vegas and at the same time a shortage of small dogs in Canada.

Croxson launched the charity in 2008 in the midst of the foreclosure crisis when people were abandoning their animals as their homes were being foreclosed. Many owners turned their dogs out onto the streets, while others cruelly left them to die trapped inside their former homes.

While Las Vegas suffers from an excess of unwanted pets, the situation is rather different in Canada where stricter rules require owners to spay and neuter their pets

The majority of evicted animal in Las Vegas end up at the Lied Animal Shelter, which claims to be the highest-volume single-site animal shelter in the country and takes in an average of 117 dogs and cats every day.

While Las Vegas suffers from an excess of unwanted pets, the situation is rather different north of the border where stricter rules require owners to spay and neuter their pets.

As a consequence, backyard and professional breeding do not exist to the same extent that they do in the United States.

The ingenious idea of unwanted American dogs emigrating to 
Canada started when one dog lover from Vancouver visited the Vegas 
shelter and said that she wanted to help save the lives of as many of these poor, unwanted animals as she could.

She introduced Croxson to Richard Kaga, the executive vice president of Petcetera, a Canadian chain of pet stores.

For the past two and a half years, FUPI has shipped between eight and 16 dogs every week to Canada, almost exclusively small dogs which are in short supply north of the border.

'For whatever reason, we have a shortage
of small dogs here, and to be quite honest, we were shocked at the size
of the problem in Las Vegas,' said Kaga.

In September FUPI celebrated sending it 
1,000th dog north of the border, that special animal was Little Pono, a three-year-old male Pomeranian mix.

Since the program started in 2010, 
Croxson said he has exported as many as 1,100 small dogs, with nearly 
three-fourths of them Chihuahuas, followed by terrier mixes, then 
poodles.

FUPI was launched in 2008 in the midst of the ecomonic crisis when people were abandoning their pets as their homes were being foreclosed

Other dogs available for adoption include Boots, left, a Shepherd Collie mix and Buddy, right, a chi mix

'I consider Las Vegas the Chihuahua capital of the world,' Croxson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The dogs are flown to Vancouver, where they are then distributed by Petcetera for adoption through the chain's 18 big-box stores in places such as Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia.

The rescue dogs are fostered by Petcetera until adopted to new homes that adhere to the FUPI adoption agreement.

Owners paying $499 (U.S.) per dog. The money, says Croxson, helps cover the costs of the animals' transportation, spaying or neutering, shots, health certificate, plus their care and boarding at Petcetera.

While the financial situation in the U.S. may have improved since the dark days of 2008, Las Vegas continues to have the second largest number of foreclosures in the U.S. and FUPI continues to send a steady steam of unwanted pets to start new lives in Canada.

In 2011, the Lied Animal Shelter in Las Vegas took in 50,000 animals, while last year it was 43,000, while an average 65 animals every day are exterminated because they can't be found a loving home.
