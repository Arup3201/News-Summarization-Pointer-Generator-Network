Out of sight: Rolf Harris pictured with his 2006 portrait of the Queen which has now disappeared

There have been more than 130 official portraits of the Queen since she ascended the throne – many by artists as eminent as Lucian Freud and Dame Laura Knight.

All are incredibly valuable and highly sought after. But now one Royal portrait – which Her Majesty posed for in person to mark her 80th birthday – appears to have mysteriously gone missing.

The man who captured the Royal likeness was Australian entertainer Rolf Harris, now charged with a string of child sex offences.

And in a bizarre game of pass-the-portrait played out by the Royal Collection, the BBC and Liverpool’s Walker Art Gallery, his 2006 picture of the Queen seems to have disappeared from the world of art.

Harris’s oil painting – commissioned by the BBC – took two months to paint. The Queen sat for it twice at Buckingham Palace and it was unveiled for her by Harris in the Palace’s Yellow Drawing Room. 

The artwork shows Her Majesty in a relaxed pose, smiling and wearing a green dress, the first of its kind to depict the monarch in such an informal pose.

The Queen wears a three-stranded pearl necklace and a brooch made for her to mark her late mother’s 100th birthday.

Harris told reporters at the public unveiling that Her Majesty had described the painting as being ‘very friendly’, although the work was not always well received at the time by art critics.

His efforts were filmed by the BBC and shown in a special edition of his programme, Rolf On Art, as part of a series of 80th birthday celebratory documentaries.

The portrait hung in the Queen’s Gallery, attached to the south-west wing of the Palace, until 2007 when it was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool for several years.

The painting left the gallery in August last year.

In November, Harris was first questioned by police involved in the Operation Yewtree inquiry, set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal, a process that has led to him being charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of children.

Now no one is eager to claim ownership of the painting, said to have been worth at least £50,000 before its disappearance.

A spokesman for the Walker Art Gallery said: ‘We had the painting on loan from De Montefort Fine Art and the Whitewalls Gallery.

'We then returned the piece and do not have any knowledge about what has happened to it since.’

Mystery: The Palace says that the painting never actually belonged to the Queen

But the Palace claims that the portrait in fact never belonged to the Queen despite it being commissioned to celebrate her birthday.

A spokesman for The Royal Collection said: ‘We don’t have it. The portrait was not gifted to the Queen and  was only ever given to us on loan so we could display it in the Queen’s  Gallery.

'There was a great deal of public interest surrounding the BBC programme about the portrait and it  was for this reason that we decided to display it in our gallery.

'The portrait was, to our understanding, commissioned and dealt with by the BBC.’

But a BBC insider said: ‘We don’t have it any more and we don’t know where it is now.’

A spokesman for  the Corporation added: ‘We never owned the artwork. If the piece is not with us or the Palace, it must be in Mr Harris’ personal collection.’

A spokesman for Harris refused to respond to several enquiries about the painting’s whereabouts.

And a spokesman at Whitewalls Galleries – also in Liverpool – which owns the bulk of Mr Harris’s other artwork, declined to comment and hung up the phone when asked about the picture.

An art world source said: ‘Rolf Harris’s art is a touchy subject. Responsibility is being passed around like hot coals and no one seems to know where it is.’
