David Walliams has  revealed he was driven into such a dark depression he attempted to kill himself several times, once on New Year's Day after Little Britain became a TV hit.

His frank admissions, made in his new autobiography, come after he spoke openly about his battle with depression and admitted this week he entered rehab.

The Little Britain star, 41, has printed his diaries in the new book, and they reveal the comedian first tried to kill himself aged 12, after being bullied at Sea Scout camp.

Dark thoughts: Comedian David Walliams reveals he tried to hang himself twice in his new autobiography Camp David

Walliams is searingly honest in his 
book, admitting he has tried to hang himself twice, slit his wrists and 
even thought about throwing himself infront of a train.

Writing in his forthcoming book Camp David, he told how he ran off into the woods with a makeshift noose, but found he was 'too tall' to go through with it.

The second time he tried to hang himself was as recently as nine years ago, soon after a split from an ex-girlfriend.

Reading from a 2003 diary entry, David wrote: 'Just tried to hang myself. But I knew
I didn’t really want to die, I just didn’t want to live. I took my 
weight with my feet and sat down.

'Earlier I had come close to stepping in front of a train. I am in total despair.'

He also ended up in hospital when he was 18 after overdosing on painkillers after he was rejected by female schoolfriend.

His mother found him and brought him into A&E, where he was given medication to empty his stomach.

He also tried cutting his throat and slitting his wrists on New Year's Day 2003.

Reflecting on the incident, he said: 'The determination wasn’t there...

'Wanting to die has always been in me.'

His admissions of his suicide 
attempts comes after he spoke about a long battle with depression which 
has 'blighted my adult life'.

In the book, he revealed he checked into The Priory on the advice of his Little Britain co-star Matt Lucas just weeks before the show began filming.

On Desert Island Discs in 2009, he 
admitted he would want a gun as his luxury item so he could kill himself
due to his fear of being alone.

He said: 'I can't stand being on my own. I hate it. I have a pathological fear of [it].

'When I'm with my own thoughts I start to unravel myself and I start to think real dark thoughts, self-destructive thoughts.

'If somebody said to me you have to spend a weekend on your own, in your house, I wouldn't be able to hack it.'

Camp David by David Walliams is published by Michael Joseph on October 18. RRP £20.00.
