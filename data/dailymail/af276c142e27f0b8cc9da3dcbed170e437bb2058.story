Ukraine's police and intelligence service accused Russia of staging a fatal shooting incident on Sunday in which pro-Moscow separatists were killed in the east of the country.

'Armed lawbreakers and saboteurs who are terrorising the local population around Slaviansk... have turned to cynical provocation,' the SBU security service said in a statement, describing the incident as a 'staged attack'.

No group was present 'other than the saboteurs and crime figures, supported and armed by officers of Russia's GRU' military intelligence, the SBU added.

The Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector, blamed by separatists for the shooting, denied involvement and also accused Russian special forces.

Russia has accused Ukraine of failing to protect civilians in the Russian-speaking east and has threatened to intervene on their behalf - as it did before annexing Crimea last month.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry noted 
that its police were unable to operate in Slaviansk since pro-Moscow 
gunmen took over the town earlier this month.

But in a statement it said
 it had established that at least three men were killed in what it 
suspected might have been an incident set up by Russian agents.

Separatists
 manning a checkpoint on a road into Slaviansk near the town of 
Bylbasovka returned fire, it said, after gunmen in four cars drove up 
and shot at them at 2:20am.

Three separatists were 
killed, two locals and a third as yet unidentified. Three were wounded. 
About a dozen attackers took off in two cars, carrying an unknown number
 of dead and wounded.

The Interior Ministry said none of its forces 
had mounted an operation overnight around Slaviansk, which it described 
as 'the most dangerous place in Ukraine, in view of the presence in the 
town of foreign saboteurs and illegal armed groups'.

'At the same 
time,' it added, 'One cannot but suspect the speed with which camera 
crews from Russian TV stations appeared at the scene of the shooting, 
and the obviously staged subject matter of news reports in the Russian 
media.'

It noted that the news was broken by media run by Dmitry 
Kiselyov, a journalist who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin 
and who, the ministry noted, is the subject of visa bans imposed by the 
United States and EU as part of sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for 
annexing Crimea.

In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said an unspecified number of innocent civilians were killed in the attack by armed men from 'Right Sector,' a far-right nationalist group which figured prominently in the overthrow of Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in February.

'Russia is indignant about this provocation by gunmen, which testifies to the lack of will on the part of the Kiev authorities to rein in and disarm nationalists and extremists,' the statement said.

It said it was a source of surprise that the incident had happened after Russia, the European Union, the United States and Ukraine signed an April 17 accord in Geneva calling on people to desist from using violence or intimidation.

Two Reuters journalists at the scene saw two dead bodies, one of them with gunshot wounds in the head and face. One man wore combat fatigues and the other was in civilian clothes. Their bodies were lying in a truck, one of them covered with a blanket.

A photographer at the scene said there were two burned out 4x4s at the barricaded makeshift checkpoint which was near a group of houses about 11 miles west of the city.

Local people were laying flowers at the scene and touching the bodies in a gesture of farewell.

'Russia insists on the strict implementation by Ukraine of the commitments it took upon itself to de-escalate the situation in the south-east of Ukraine,' the ministry's statement said.

The self-declared mayor of Slaviansk, who supports the pro-Russian separatists in the city, said there had been a clash overnight and there were casualties, a Reuters Television team in Slaviansk said.

Yesterday the United States said it is considering deploying about 150 soldiers for military exercises to begin in Poland and Estonia in the next few weeks.

The exercises would follow Russia's buildup of forces near its border with Ukraine and its annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier this week that the U.S. is looking for ways to reassure its NATO allies of its strong commitment to collective defense.

The breakthrough peace agreement is being ignored as armed pro-Russian separatists repeatedly refused to recognise its terms.

The separatist leaders ridiculed the deal, which was brokered by the US, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union in Geneva.

Branding Ukraine’s Western-backed interim government ‘illegal’, they insisted that they would not comply with its terms unless they were granted further concessions and guarantees.

They also announced that their forces would continue their occupation of state buildings in at least ten eastern cities and towns – but could seize even more.

A security service officer was killed in Slaviansk six days ago, where the police station and the security service office were seized a day earlier by camouflaged armed men.

Video footage taken in the aftermath of the attack showed a bullet-ridden SUV on the side of the road and a pool of blood on the passenger seat where the gun battle was supposed to have taken place.
