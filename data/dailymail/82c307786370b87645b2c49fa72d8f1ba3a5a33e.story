Ousted: Juan McFarland has been removed from the Alabama Baptist church he has led for 23 years

A pastor has revealed in a series of sermons that he has used drugs, has AIDS and knowingly had sex with parishioners in church grounds while suffering from the disease, according to reports.

Following his series of confessions, Juan Demetrius McFarland has been removed from Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama as his stunned congregation tries to come to terms with his revelations.

McFarland, who has led the church for 23 years, first revealed to worshipers in mid-September that he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008.

At first, the congregation offered their sympathy and support.

'The church was very accepting of Reverend McFarland and was willing to help him in any way possible,' an unidentified church member told WSFA 12 News.

But after he returned to the pulpit, he revealed that he had used drugs - including cocaine - while pastor and used church funds to pay for business trips that he then didn't take, AL.com reported.

And there was more.

'He concealed from the church that he had knowingly engaged in adultery in the church building with female members of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church while knowingly having AIDS,' said church deacon Nathan Williams Jr. 

Shocking: McFarland, pictured delivering a sermon at the church earlier this year, revealed that he had taken cocaine while pastor, misused church funds for trips he didn't take and had sex with churchgoers

Whether or not he told all of his sexual partners that he had HIV or AIDS is yet to be determined, but one church-goer said she would be undergoing tests to see if she had the disease, WSFA reported.

'My heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen,' the church member said. 'The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself.' 

Charges have not been filed against McFarland, 47, although some church members are calling for his prosecution.

A former Shiloh deacon who heard his sermons told AL.com that McFarland is not taking medicine to treat his illness.

After his most recent sermons, deacons voted on October 5 to remove him as pastor. 

On Sunday, Montgomery police were called after church members started fighting with each other but no one was removed.

Williams said he thinks police were called on people who had voted the pastor out.

The spat has since continued, with McFarland and some newly appointed staff changing the locks on the church on Monday morning, AL.com reported.

Williams told WSFA that leaders have obtained legal counsel to save the church.

'Our moves are going to come directly from counsel. We want peace and we want to do things right, legally,' Williams said. 'We are not looking to hurt him. We are looking to get the church back.'

McFarland is also the Moderator with the Alabama Middle District Baptist Association, which includes 34 churches. Leaders indicated there are not yet any plans to remove him from this position.
