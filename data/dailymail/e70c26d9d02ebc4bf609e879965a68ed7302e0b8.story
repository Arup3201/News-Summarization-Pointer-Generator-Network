A dirty bomb attack is a ‘real threat’ faced by Britain, the Foreign Office warned today.

The government claims nuclear terrorism is still one of the biggest threats to global peace.

Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt used a speech in London to warn of the dangers posed by a rise nuclear weapons being smuggled around the world.

Alistair Burt will say countries around the world face a 'real and global threat' of a nuclear terror attack. South Korean radiologists are pictured taking part in an exercise in dealing with a possible radioactive terror attack at the Kimpo airport

He warned  that information freely available on the internet combined with nuclear material become more widely available means an attack, once ‘unthinkable’ is not a ‘real and global threat’.

Mr Burt, who has responsibility for our counter-terrorism policy, said the UK’s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain.

He said: ‘Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat.  A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. 

‘Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences – psychological, economic, political, and environmental.

‘Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago.  But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.’

Mr Burt said nuclear material is becoming ‘more available’ as more countries develop nuclear energy. 

Mr Burt warns there is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than ever before

‘In today’s world of modern 
communication, information is spreading faster.  Like nuclear energy, 
this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks.  There 
is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there 
ever has been.

‘As is the case in cyberspace, the 
danger is stateless in geographical space.  It is impossible for any 
national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain 
on its own. 

‘Global smuggling networks are thriving.  Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.’

He said the UK has been at the ‘forefront’ of tackling illicit trafficking of nuclear material.
‘It was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations
 for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer.’

He also lifted the lid on the UK’s 
secretive Atomic Weapons Establishment which works on detecting the 
trade in nuclear material.  ‘This is a rare opportunity to publically 
acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the 
United Kingdom for over 50 years,’ he said.

Mr Burt’s stark warning came as he addressed a meeting in London of experts from around the world discussing ways to prevent a devastating attack.

His warning comes as global experts gather in London to plot how to thwart catastrophic attacks that could kill thousands.

Fears were high that a bomb attack would target the London Olympics this summer, Mr Burt will admit.

Last month Senior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi warned: ‘Nuclear  terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to our global peace and security. 

‘A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic.’

The Foreign Office is working with dozens of countries to bolster the UN Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.

The convention allows for international cooperation in the investigation, prosecution and extradition of anyone plotting terrorist acts involving radioactive material or a nuclear device.
