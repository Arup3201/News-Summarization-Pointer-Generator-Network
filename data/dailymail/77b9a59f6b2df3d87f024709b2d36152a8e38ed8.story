Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment the two men who hacked to death a soldier in Woolwich were shot as they charged at police officers called to the scene.

The two men, can be seen brandishing weapons in broad daylight as they confronted officers following the brutal killing of Drummer Lee Rigby.

The footage, obtained by the Daily Mirror, shows the men walking towards parked officers before one splinters off and runs full speed towards a marked car, dropping a bladed weapon.Â

Just inches before reaching the car, two shots can be heard as one of the men falls to the ground.

Officers
 then surround the prone body before four more shots ring out felling 
the second man, as another two shots are fired - eight in total.

Screams can be heard as the men are filmed lying on the ground as the officers swarm around the pair and detain them.

The
 footage appears to have been taken from a nearby block of flats 
overlooking the scene after Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was killed by two 
assailants.

A total of four people including the men shot by police have now been arrested in connection with the brutal attack.

Screams can be heard from the crowd who have gathered at the scene following the shots

Firearms tactics expert former Detective Chief Inspector Peter Kirkham told the Daily Mirror: 'I have never seen anything like this before, or even heard of it happening before.

'For two suspects to carry out a brutal attack like this then stand around in plain sight waiting for the police is crazy.'

He added the officers 'had no option' but to stop them by opening fire.

Scotland
 Yard said a man and a woman, both 29, were held today on suspicion of 
conspiracy to murder and are being questioned at a police station in 
south London.

The two 
men who were shot, aged 22 and 28, have been arrested on suspicion of 
murder and remain in hospital in a stable condition with non 
life-threatening injuries.

Brutal killing: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who was murdered in Woolwich

Six
 residential addresses were being searched today as part of the 
investigation, three in south London, one in east London, one in north 
London and one in Lincolnshire.

In a statement the force said: 'This is a large, complex and fast-moving investigation which continues to develop.

'Many lines of inquiry are being followed by detectives and the investigation is progressing well.'

Officers have recovered a number of items from the murder scene and continue to appeal for witnesses to get in touch, and send in footage and photographs of what happened.

Drummer Rigby was brutally murdered by two attackers who were British and of Nigerian descent.

The pair, who were shot by police, were known to security services, and apparently shouted 'Allah Akhbar' as they struck.

It is believed that the serving soldier was run over and then hacked to death, yards from a primary school.

Eyewitnesses said that one of the attackers charged towards officers clutching bloodied weapons including a meat cleaver, while the other brandished a gun.

Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it is not pursuing any criminal or misconduct offences in relation to the officers who used their weapons.

IPCC investigators have viewed CCTV of what happened, and said two officers fired guns and one discharged a Taser.

They have given initial accounts of what happened.

IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'Our investigation is as a result of the tragic events yesterday and I would like to express my sincere sympathies to the family of Lee Rigby at this terrible time.

'We have viewed CCTV footage of the police shooting. At this stage we are not pursuing any criminal or misconduct offences.

'Officers have provided initial statements and we will be obtaining additional accounts.

'The IPCC is independently verifying information regarding the circumstances of this incident and we can promise the Woolwich community, and wider public, that our investigation will be thorough.'
