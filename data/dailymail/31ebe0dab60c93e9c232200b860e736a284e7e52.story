Yacine Brahimi bagged a hat-trick as Porto thrashed BATE Borisov 6-0 in their Champions League Group H opener on Wednesday.

Porto produced a dominant performance, highlighted by Brahimi, as the two-time European champions overran its Belarusian opponents. 

A Sergei Chernik blunder gifted Porto the lead after five minutes, with the goalkeeper's botched throw allowing Brahimi to fire into the roof of the net.

The Algerian winger was on the board again in the 32nd minute after beating two defenders on a solo run down the left flank.

With BATE struggling to hold back Porto's onslaught, Jackson Martinez scored with a header at the front post in the 37th for his sixth goal in five games. It could have been worse for the visitors as the Colombian also hit the woodwork twice.

Brahimi curled a free kick over the wall for his third in the 57th minute before Adrian Lopez in the 61st and Vincent Aboubakar in the 76th completed the rout.

The visitor's counterattacks occasionally had Porto back-pedalling, with Fabiano saving at Mikhail Gordeychuk's feet in the 12th, but clear chances for the visitor were rare.

BATE is appearing in the group stage for the third time in four seasons, though it has never qualified for the knockout round.

Athletic Bilbao and Shakhtar Donetsk drew 0-0 in the other Group H game.
