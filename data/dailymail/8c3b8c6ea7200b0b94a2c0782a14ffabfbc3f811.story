Sarah Smith is brought to tears when she thinks about the moment she will be able to walk beside her son Finn as he holds her hand.

In November last year, her then 13-month-old son contracted meningococcal and spent two and a half weeks in a coma fighting for his life.

Finn had to have both feet and one of his hands amputated after they were badly affected by bruising.

Now that he's 21 months old, his mother Sarah Smith (right) is looking forward to him getting some prosthetic feet so he can learn to walk

Now 21 months old, the Sunshine Coast boy has made a remarkable recovery.

The 'happy go lucky' little boy who loves playing outside is due to have surgery Wednesday to release the scars that have closed over his left hand â€“ which will allow him to pick things up on his palm and use his thumb and remaining three fingers.

And in three weeks Finn will get a new pair of prosthetic legs and will start learning how to take his first steps.

But it has been a long eight months for his parents Sarah and Jason Smith.

On the night of November 21, Finn had been up all night with flu-like symptoms and every once in a while he would get the shakes.

The couple had an on-call doctor visit at 1am, who diagnosed him with a viral infection and told them to get him antibiotics in the morning.

The next day during a car trip to Brisbane, they noticed three bruise-like dots on his forehead.

They raced to the nearest hospital, which was seven minutes away at Redcliffe, and when they arrived Finn was admitted straight away.

'Within half an hour he was pretty much unrecognisable,' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

Finn was crying tears of blood, blood was coming out of his mouth and his body had puffed up.

'The meningococcal had done its incubation time the night before,' she added.

'You don't know until the spots come out and once the rash comes out the damage is done - your little boy is fighting for his life.'

On November 22 last year after he was raced to hospital he was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks

When he started showing signs of waking he was slowly weaned off the breathing machines so he could start relying on his own lungs again

Finn was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks.

When he started showing signs of waking he was slowly weaned off the breathing machines so he could start relying on his own lungs again.

But the meningococcal bruising had affected his hands and feet so severely that they needed to be amputated.

His first operation happened on Christmas Eve, where his left leg was amputated below the knee.

Three days later his right arm was amputated through the wrist. On December 29 he had to have his right leg amputated through the ankle.

All together Finn had to spend the next 10 weeks in hospital, in order to build up his strength and muscle again.

'He couldn't sit up or hold his head, he was so weak,' Ms Smith said.

When the Smiths were allowed to leave hospital in February they tried to return to as normal a family life as they could.

'He was just so scared and confused when he was at the hospital so we just tried to let him be the normal child and the happy little kid that he is,' Ms Smith said.

'Our life now is different in that we have so much more in our plate in a medical way, but everything else is just play time, we've tried to keep it as normal as possible.'

Now Finn loves playing outdoors and going for swimming lessons once a week

Finn is also very protective of his limbs and he 'certainly knows what's missing', Ms Smith said

Ms Smith said Finn is a very independent and playful boy who loves the outdoors, but he's also very protective of his limbs.

'He's very protective of everything now,' she said.

'Although he gets around and he's certainly a happy little boy and has an amazing spirit, he certainly knows what's missing.

'He's OK with us to touch him and put his socks on but he doesn't allow strangers to touch him.'

On Wednesday Finn will have another operation on his left hand to release some of the scars.

He lost his index finger but he still has most of his thumb and the stumps of his middle, ring and pinky finger.

'That will allow him to have movement in the little fingers and allow the palm to be flattened out and be able to pick thinks up properly, and he'll also have a skin graft on back of his wrist.'

After his operation, the family will start looking forward to Finn getting new legs

Ms Smith is dreading taking Finn back to hospital because it brings back awful memories.

'I'm not looking forward to it, we've been home since February and he's sort of been getting around and doing his thing,' she said.

'Going back to hospital and the theatre, it's hard to have to do it to him but it's something obviously we have to do.

'We'll just work through it one day at a time.'

After his operation, the family will start looking forward to Finn getting new legs.

The 21-month-old has been learning to stand using a pair of cylindrical stump-like boots, but he wasn't ready to start walking with them.

'These new ones are actually going to have feet and we are going to get him a walking frame so he can stand up and walk around.'

Ms Smith said the emotions surrounding what has happened to Finn are still very raw for her and Mr Smith

But Ms Smith said she has been absolutely blown away by the support her family has received from the Sunshine Coast community

New feet will greatly improve quality of life for Finn, who loves playing outside.

'He's an outdoors kids, he just loves being outdoors,' she said.

'Just like any other boy he likes to crawl around in the dirt and he loves playing with our black Labrador, that's his best buddy.'

Finn also loves to go swimming once a week.

'He's just a real happy go lucky sort of boy, he just loves life,' Ms Smith said.

Now Ms Smith is focussed on getting Finn through his hand surgery, and then helping him learn to walk

The disease is any infection caused by meningococcal bacteria

Meningococcal bacteria can cause meningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain, and septicaemia, an infection in the bloodstream

The infection can develop quickly and lead to serious illness or even death

Early diagnosis and emergency treatment with antibiotics are vital

Immunisation is available for some strains of meningococcal bacteria

Meningococcal bacteria are difficult to spread and only passed from person to person by regular and intimate contact with infected secretions from the back of the nose and throat

Symptoms include rash of purple or red pinprick spots or larger bruises

'It's still a sore subject but we are trying to do our best to accept our little boy and try not to do the parents thing where you're wondering about what he could have done,' she said.

'It's very hard for parents, the grieving process that you go through.'

But Ms Smith said she has been absolutely blown away by the support her family has received from the Sunshine Coast community.

'It was really amazing, it just meant so much,' she said, fighting back tears.

'They've done so much fundraising for him, they've sent so many presents.

'It's very touching and it just warms my heart to think about the goodness in people who have never met us before.'

Now Ms Smith is focussed on getting Finn through his hand surgery, and then helping him learn to walk.

'You just want him to walk next to you, like your little boy would have been able to.'
