Twitter officially confirmed that Britain now has 10 million 'Tweeters' - making us one of the world's most enthusiastic users of the social network.

'Snapshot of Twitter in the UK: 10m active users, 80% of which are also active on mobile. And an office that's been open almost a year,' said the company via a Tweet from its official account yesterday.

The country has the fourth-largest number of Twitter users in the world, beaten only by the U.S., Brazil and Japan.

Tweets in your email: Twitter will now send a digest of trending topics and subject that you might have missed

'140 brands have advertised on the site since we launched promoted products for the UK in Sept 2011,' says a spokesperson.

'We went from zero employees a year ago to more than 30 today.'

There are 140 million Twitter users worldwide, churning out around 340 million Tweets per day.

While the site is highly 'visible' due to celebrities airing their private lives through their Tweets, it's actually dwarfed by other social networks such as Facebook's 900 million users, and even Google Plus, which has 170 million.

Twitter is adding new features to compete with its high-profile rivals.

Othman Laraki, director of Twitters's growth and international, said: 'Starting today, you can discover the best of Twitter in a weekly email digest delivered to your inbox. This summary features the most relevant Tweets and stories shared by the people youâ€™re connected to on Twitter.

'Stories feature a design similar to the recently updated Discover tab, emphasising who shared each story beneath summaries to help you decide which ones matter most to you.

Twitter is about to start dishing out a weekly digest of the best 140-character Tweets you may have missed.

The micro-blogging website has traditionally veered away from email drops, relying on users to check out the site or app to catch up on what friends, family and famous movie stars are tweeting about.

But from today, the service will send out the digest of Tweets based on what they believe are the most important Tweets you should be reading.
