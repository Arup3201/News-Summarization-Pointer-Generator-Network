The world's most expensive suitcase- which costs as much as a luxury sports car- has gone on sale at Harrods for an eye-watering £37,500.

Named the Trunk, the case is made from a super-tough material that should defy even the roughest of baggage handlers.

Available only in black, it also features a quilted leather interior, genuine crocodile trim details, custom-made hangers and carbon fibre flaps enhanced by luxurious wooden inlays.

Upmarket Italian luggage brand TecknoMonster, which produces the luxury suitcase, describe it as 'the first of its kind in the world and a 21st century take on a classical travel accessory.' 

It is now going on sale exclusively at Harrods in Knightsbridge, London for £37,500- the price of a Porsche Boxster sports car or a mid-range Mercedes luxury saloon. 

A TecknoMonster spokesman claimed The Trunk is the first suitcase made entirely of carbon fibre, making it stronger than anything on the market so far.

He said: 'Deeply rooted in a bygone era of steam trains and cruise liners, TecknoMonster are proud to put a modern twist on the classic trunk, within the context of their own amazing technological and structural innovations.

'The traditional travel trunk is synonymous with travel throughout European history and has now been meticulously designed and adapted by Giacomo Valentini, CEO and founder of the brand, to the needs of modern travellers and contemporary bon vivants who want to make the most of each journey.'

The high-end case, which measures 86cm high, 60cm wide and 36cm deep with a volume of 154 litres, has clever innovations such as an inner compartment which allows garments to be hung up.

It also boasts include four bespoke highly stress-resistant, low-noise pivoting wheels, an exclusive high sealing rubber to protect the zip and hand-machined solid aluminium closures.
