Thirty years after British forces liberated the Falkland Islands from Argentinian invaders, the two countries are still at odds over who has the more legitimate claim to the land.

But it seems the inhabitants of the island would prefer to be left to their own devices, with just one in three saying they actually feel British.

A census in the self-governing British Overseas Territory found that an overwhelming 59 percent say their national identity is 'Falkland Islander'.

Just 29 per cent admit feeling 'British'.

The census results have implications for Argentina, which refuses to deal directly with the Falkland Islands' local government and accuses Britain of running what Argentines call the Islas Malvinas as an illegal colony.

The survey also puts the average annual income at $32,213 (£20,015), much higher than Argentina's $9,620 (£5,977) as of last year, or that of the Falklands' other Latin American neighbors.

The income figure underlines how much things have changed since before the 1982 war.

Back then, wool prices had bottomed out internationally and invading Argentine soldiers were told they would be welcomed by impoverished and oppressed tenant farmers.

Instead, they encountered a stubbornly defiant population that helped British troops retake the islands.

Sheltered by continued military support, Falklanders have seen their livelihoods greatly improve since the war, with revenue flowing in from fisheries, tourism and offshore oil development.

But the census also reveals a problem: The islands' population hasn't grown since the last survey was done in 2006. There are only 2,563 residents after civilian contractors and British military personnel and their dependents are excluded.

The population is aging rapidly, too, with the ranks of people older than 65 increasing by 14 percent in the last six years.

'If the Falklands is to progress we need to increase our population,' said Les Harris, a 73-year-old retired power station manager who was born in Chile.

The census shows unemployment at just 1 percent, with one-fifth of all workers having multiple jobs. The largest employer by far is the government, at 28 percent, followed by agriculture (11 percent) and hospitality and tourism (11 percent).

Offshore oil and gas development could bring sudden wealth to the islands if several drilling efforts strike it rich. But the effort currently employs just 26 islanders, and there simply aren't enough people around to work the jobs created by a growing economy.

'There is virtually no spare capacity within the labor market to accommodate any additional employment opportunities that may arise in the future. Indeed, almost 20 percent of persons in employment have more than one job,' the government said Tuesday.

The census shows immigration slowing, due to one of the world's most restrictive policies: Newcomers aren't allowed to apply for islander status, giving them voting rights among other things, until they have completed seven years of residency. That can be done only by repeatedly renewing temporary labor contracts. Even then, only 40 people can apply each year, and not all are accepted.

The census says 70 per cent of the population, 1,973 people, are Falkland Islanders or Falkland Island Status Holders.
