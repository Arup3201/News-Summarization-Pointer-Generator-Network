President Barack Obama's foreign policy approval rating slid even further this month, reaching an all-time low of 37 percent, a new poll shows.

Iraq had not imploded when the poll was taken, so poll-takers did not ask whether President Obama is to blame for the instability in the Persian Gulf.

They did ask about Obama's decision to swap five Taliban 
commanders for an American soldier being held hostage by the terrorist 
network, however, and the results do not bode well for Obama. Less than one in three Americans say Obama made the right call.

Americans are so dissatisfied with the president's leadership on a host of issues that 54 percent of them say they've lost faith in his ability to lead the country.

President Obama's foreign policy approval rating has plunged in his second term

The president has been floundering in the foreign policy arena for the last two and a half years, according to a series of polls commissioned by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.

The last time a majority of Americans said they approved of the way the president was handling foreign policy was December of 2012.

Since then his foreign policy approval rating has bounced around the mid 40s before firmly sliding into the upper 30s two months ago.

Similarly, President Obama's foreign policy disapproval rating reached an all-time high this month at 57 percent.

Americans' opinions of the president overall have soured throughout his second term.

A poll released last week by CNN/ORC International found that Americans now have as much disdain for President Obama as they do former President Bush, who exited the White House with gutter-level approval ratings. Both presidents received negative feedback from 51 percent of respondents.

Americans who took the NBC/WSJ poll gave Obama a 41 percent approval rating, his lowest-ever approval rating, for the second time in the last three months.

People who were displeased withe the president named poor foreign policy decisions as the top reason for their dissatisfaction along with Obamacare. The Bergdahl terror trade came in a close second, followed by the president's handling of the economy.

Poll-takers were also strongly against the president's plan to release the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay by a margin of 59 percent-to-26 percent. That's consistent 
with a Gallup poll released last week which found that two in three Americans neither wanted Obama to set the terrorists being detained there free nor wanted him to move them to jails on U.S. soil.

At issue for many Americans is the president's decision to exchange five terrorists for the release of the American soldier pictured here - Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. This shot was taken from a video that was posted by Voice of Jihad. It shows Bergdahl sitting in a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan

Americans' negative feelings toward the president's policies both at home and abroad will not necessarily translate into a vote for Republicans in November's elections, however.

'We know more about the challenges 
facing President Obama in the next two years of his term than how this 
yearâ€™s congressional elections will play out in the next six months,' Democratic pollster Fred Yang, one of three pollsters responsible for the NBC/WSJ poll, said to NBC News.

Democrats and Republicans were statistically tied in the poll at 45 percent and 43 percent respectively.

Further more, only 29 percent of respondents said they have
 a favorable view of the GOP, compared with the 38 
percent of respondents who said they saw Democrats in a positive light. The poll oversampled Democrats by several percentage points, though.

Bill McInturff, the Republican who worked on the poll, summed the results up this way: 'This is a bad poll for President 
Obama, and not a good poll for anybody else.'
