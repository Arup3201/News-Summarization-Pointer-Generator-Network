A suicide bomber has killed at least six people, and wounded ten, after blowing himself up in a busy market in the Nigerian city of Gombe.

The brutal attack bears all the hallmarks of Islamist group Boko Haram, although no one has yet claimed responsibility for it.

They have killed thousands of Nigerians in gun and bomb assaults in the last five years - particularly in the hard to reach areas in the north-east of the country where Gombe lies.

Umar Shittu, a spokesman for the National Management Agency for Gombe, said: 'Our workers have evacuated six bodies and 10 injured, and we believe there could more bodies because the market is usually populated.'

Earlier this week, satellite images emerged showing the aftermath of Boko Haram's 'deadliest ever attack' on the villages of Baga and Doron Baga.

The pictures, released by Amnesty International, showed how over 2,000 people were brutally murdered - and 3,7000 buildings were razed to the ground by the extremist group.

In the pictures taken beforehand, areas in red showed buildings and trees in the densely packed towns in the north of the country.

But in the pictures taken after the massacre, grey areas reveal how the the town has been decimated by the assault.

The destruction shown in these images matches the horrific stories from eyewitnesses revealing how Boko Haram militants shot hundreds of civilians in cold blood. 

One witness described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately, killing even small children and a woman who was in labour.

He added: 'Half of the baby boy is out and she died like this.'

Ibrahim Gambo, a 25-year-old truck driver, survived the relentless attack in Baga but he still doesn't know if his wife and daughter are safe.

He said: 'As we were running for our lives, we came across many corpses, both men and women, and even children.

'Some had gunshot wounds in the head and some had their legs bound and hands tied behind their backs.'

Ineffective: Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan (pictured) has been accused of failing to combat increasingly deadly attacks from Boko Haram

Next week, West African leaders will approach the African Union to create a multi-national alliance to fight back against Boko Haram insurgents.

Such a force would represent the most robust international response yet to the militants who have killed thousands in Nigeria alone - and also crossed the border to attack innocent people in Niger and Cameroon. 

Boko Haram is seen as the most serious security threat to Nigeria - Africa's most populous country and its biggest energy producer.

Ghana's President, John Mahama, has said: 'Terrorism is like a cancer and if we don't deal with it it will keep going.

Speaking as the chair of the West African regional alliance ECOWAS - which has been accused of failing to combat Boko Haram - he added: 'Nigeria is taking military action and Cameroon is fighting Boko Haram, but I think we are increasingly getting to the point where probably a regional or a multinational force is coming into consideration.' 

'It threatens everybody in the sub region. When it comes to terrorism nobody is too far or too near.'
