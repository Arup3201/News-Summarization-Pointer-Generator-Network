A theatre professor and costume designer has married fashion with biology by creating a series of dresses inspired by cancer cells.

Fashioning Cancer: The Correlation between Destruction and Beauty is an exhibition by Jacqueline Firkins, who works in the Department of Theatre and Film at the University of British Columbia.

It consists of ten ball gowns in pattens inspired by microscopic photos of cancer cells and cellular systems, with the aim of prompting a conversation about the relationship between beauty, body image and the disease.

Biology beauty: Her ten ball gowns are part of an exhibition called Fashioning Cancer: The Correlation between Destruction and Beauty

The images were captured by her associate Dr Christian C G Naus, a professor in the Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, and his colleagues.

One of the photos shows a brain tumor - with a normal brain area, depicted in blue and green, being encountered by invading cancer cells, which are colored red.

This is represented in a gown worn by model Eva Tavares, an undergraduate opera student. Her floor-length halter dress is made from shredded blue and pink silk saris.

The scraps of color, which mirror the microscopic picture of cells, are attached to an organza skirt, and the underskirt is made of tulle.

Another one of Dr Naus's images shows an injured area of brain tissue, which is colored faded red. Tiny green spots on the tissue represent dying neurons - part of the process when cancers progress.

Theatre production and design student Rebecca Burks models the dress designed to mirror this image, which is made from black silk taffeta, with a red silk bow.

Ms Firkins explains that her collection is in part designed as an alternative to the typical fashions currently associated with cancer, like the pink ribbon.

Colorful: This dress, which is modeled by UBC alumna Bronwyn Malloy, is made of green silk charmeuse, with blue rose appliques designed to represent nuclei

'Many women who have battled cancer 
express a disconnect with the fashion imagery that commonly represents 
the disease,' she said.

Not
 all the gowns represent cancerous cell systems, though. Some of them 
simply offer an artistic interpretation of the body's complex and 
colorful biology.

One dress, which is modeled by UBC 
alumna Bronwyn Malloy, is made of green silk charmeuse, with blue rose 
appliques designed to represent nuclei.

Body activity: The bright blue shows DNA, and the green surrounding it represents membrane channels

Biological process: Green nerve cells migrate on red supporting cells to develop a network with other neurons

In movement: These 'brain cells on the move' are interpreted in a gown worn by student model Simone McIntosh, made of red organza with green silk ribbons

This gown takes inspiration from an image of astrocytes, a type of glial cells, growing in a culture dish.

The green aspect of the photo shows the gap junction channels which link the cells, while the blue dye depicts nuclei or DNA.

Ms Firkins explained in a release: 'My hope is that somehow through 
fashion, I more closely tap into what a woman might be feeling about her
 body as she undergoes [cancer].'

Beautiful science: This image shows two proteins interacting within brain cancer cells

In person: Design student Chanel McCartney wears a green taffeta short sleeve with speckled applique diagonal trim and eyelash scarf

She added that she hopes the dresses 'simultaneously reflect a 
strength, beauty, and resilience.'

The
 public presentation of the gowns, as well as a discussion about the 
collection, will take place on March 25 at UBC's Frederic Wood Theatre.

After
 that, Ms Firkins hopes to find a sponsor and venue to auction off the 
dresses, with proceeds going towards raising money for cancer research, 
patients and survivors.
