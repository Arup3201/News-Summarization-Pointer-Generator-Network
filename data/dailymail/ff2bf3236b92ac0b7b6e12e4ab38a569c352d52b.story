Psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie

Most people have told a lie only to be caught out later on when they mix up a story or forget about the fib all together.

But now psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie and not get caught out.

U.S. scientists said a lie that consists of simple denial doesn't become so ingrained in our memory and could therefore be more easily busted at a later date.

Psychologists have found it is harder to remember a false denial than a made-up description, which could have important implications for forensic interrogation.

Even telling the truth when denying something can lead to a guilty feeling.

For example, the scientists said a suspect who repeatedly refutes being at a crime may actually begin to imagine where it was, what it looked like and who was present, causing the scene to feel strangely familiar even if they were not there.

The phenomenon is known as the â€˜illusory truth effectâ€™ when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct, and in a courtroom can be disastrous.

Professor Sean Lane, of Louisiana State University, said: 'They are telling the truth, they are denying, but later this thing seems familiar. They are confusing the familiarity of the repetition with the truth, not realising those repeated denials are what makes it seem familiar 48 hours later.'

Humans remember false descriptions well 
because of the effort required to make them up. When subjects in a study
 were asked to recall these 48 hours later, they remembered accurately 
what they had said and that it was untrue.

The same is not true for false denials. Denying something that actually happened is often brief, and its cognitive demand is therefore much smaller.

Professor Lane explained: 'I am not constructing details. But I am also not going to remember the act because there is not much cognitively involved in the denial.'

The 'illusory truth effect' - when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct - can prove disastrous in a courtroom

His participants had a hard time remembering their own false denials after 48 hours.

In a series of rapid fire questions a guilty suspect is more inclined to forget a false denial and therefore more likely to contradict himself on the same information later.

But there is also a frightening implication 
for the innocent, as the volunteers also had a hard time remembering if 
the denials they had made were true or false.

This same memory problem 
might plague suspects asked to make repeated truthful denials.

The study, published in the Journal of Applied Research and Memory Cognition, says false descriptions and false denials are two separate kinds of lies that use different mental machinery.

Professor Lane said: 'If I am going to lie to you about something that did not happen, I am going to have to keep a lot of different constraints in mind.'

Liars must remember what they say and also monitor how plausible they seem and the depth of detail they offer as well as how confident they appear to the listener.

If the listener does not appear to be buying it, they must also adapt the story accordingly.

Professor Lane said: 'As the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions, it also lays down information about the process of construction.'
