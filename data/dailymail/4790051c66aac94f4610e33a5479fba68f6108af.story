One Direction fans can now dance all night in what they're sure to think is the best Christmas jumper ever - a red and white knit emblazoned with the band's name.

The festive garment is available from the boy band's website for Â£44.99.

Christmas jumpers have been a December wardrobe staple for the last two years so it's perhaps no surprise they have now been given a rock n' roll twist.

But they're not all as festive as they first seem with the Slayer version emblazoned with skulls and pentacles and a Metallica knit with snow flakes resembling barbed wire and upside down crosses that Christians may find offensive.

The cheeky Queens Of The Stone Age offering is also not for children - seemingly showing innocent reindeer from a distance that are actually getting frisky when seen close up.

And Morrissey may have sung that he would go out tonight but he 'hasn't got a stitch to wear' but that's no excuse this December as there's now a Christmas jumper with his name on.

Other retailers are also stocking seasonal sweaters for Death From Above and The Roots fans, amongst others.

But the jumpers don't just show the wearers' appreciation for their favourite musicians, they could also raise their sex appeal.

A
 recent survey by mysinglefriend.com found that more than half (56 per 
cent) of women find Christmas jumpers a big turn on - which perhaps 
inspired the Queens Of The Stone Age design.

Meanwhile, Christmas jumpers are being hailed as the saviour of the High Street after shops like New Look have revealed that the unseasonably mild autumn weather damaged trade.

The warmer climate has meant shoppers have held back from buying winter clothes but the group said it was still optimistic the festive period could turn things around.

Forty-one per cent of the nation now 
own a Christmas jumper, according to the research from Fox's Puddings, 
fuelled by their popularity with celebrities and fashionistas including 
Samantha Cameron, Cheryl Cole and TOWIE'S Sam Faiers.

Friday
 will be national 'Christmas Jumper Day' when Brits are encouraged to 
pull on a festive knit to raise money for Save the Children.
