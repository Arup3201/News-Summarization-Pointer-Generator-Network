Birmingham City have been given permission to talk to Burton Albion manager Gary Rowett about succeeding Lee Clark.

Bromsgrove-born Rowett, 40, spent two years at Birmingham as a player under Trevor Francis between 1998 and 2000.

Malcolm Crosby and Richard Beale were in joint-caretaker charge for Birmingham’s 1-0 defeat at Blackburn on Tuesday following Clark’s departure 24 hours earlier.

Rowett has twice led Burton Albion to Wembley Stadium in the League Two play-offs - but has lost both

Birmingham are keen to have a new manager installed in time for the derby with Wolves at Molineux on November 1.

Rowett has led Burton to the League Two play-offs in each of the last two seasons, losing in last term’s final to Fleetwood Town in May, and they are second despite losing at home to Morecambe at the weekend.

Speaking before Tuesday night’s 4-3 win at Carlisle, Rowett said: ‘First and foremost, it’s a compliment to everyone at the club that we’re doing things, for the third season in a row, quite well. A little bit of success is always going to bring speculation.’

Other candidates for the role include Mike Phelan, Billy McKinlay and Owen Coyle. None of those would require compensation and it is understood Rowett also has a release clause.

MK Dons manager Karl Robinson was approached by Birmingham, while Swindon Town manager Mark Cooper, like Rowett a former City player, and son of former St Andrew’s boss Terry Cooper, is another to have been linked with the post.
