Home nation Brazil were sent into party mode as they topped Group A, courtesy of a resounding 4-1 win over Cameroon at the Brasilia national stadium.

It was, yet again, their poster boy and the World Cup's current top goalscorer who made a difference as Neymar scored his third and fourth of the tournament.

And the 22-year-old was favoured by the media after his inspiring display, as Sportsmail takes a look at the front pages of foreign newspapers.
