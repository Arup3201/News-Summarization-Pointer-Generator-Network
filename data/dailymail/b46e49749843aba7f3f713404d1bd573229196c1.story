One year ago to this very day, Darren Fletcher lay in a hospital bed with an intravenous drip connected to his arm.

He was so heavily sedated following surgery that he could barely open his eyes to watch the television in front of him. On the screen, Scotland were giving England a run for their money at Wembley. It was a fixture he had always dreamed of playing in.

Fletcher’s future as a footballer was hanging in the balance. The decision to undergo a series of operations had been taken in an attempt to finally quell the suffering caused by chronic ulcerative colitis. Suffering that had severely disrupted three years of his career.

Reversal of fortune: Darren Fletcher has been named Manchester United vice captain behind Wayne Rooney

This morning, the picture surrounding Fletcher is very different. As another Barclays Premier League season prepares to dawn, the 30-year-old is getting used to his new role as vice-captain of Manchester United.

Talk of comebacks and courage is all too readily bandied around in the sporting world, but Fletcher’s own recovery has been genuinely remarkable.

Forget any notion that his appointment as Wayne Rooney’s back-up is rooted in sentiment. That is hardly Louis van Gaal’s style.

Rather, this is a case of Fletcher proving through his unstinting efforts over pre-season that he has a real future within the plans of the Dutch taskmaster.

Fletcher scored in Tuesday’s 2-1 friendly win over Valencia before expressing sincere delight about his new status within the squad.

‘It’s a very proud moment for me and my family,’ he said. ‘Wayne and I have always worked well together and will continue to work closely together in our new roles. I would like to thank the manager for putting his trust in me.’

That is the key issue here. Van Gaal has clearly liked what he has seen from Fletcher in terms of performance and personality. ‘A natural leader,’ was the 63-year-old’s assessment.

Those who have followed Fletcher’s struggles are almost as thrilled as the man himself about this confirmation of his continued worth to one of the world’s biggest clubs.

Former United favourite Lou Macari has been close to the situation via his work for the in-house television station.

‘Getting back in and around the Manchester United first team is the real prize for Darren,’ insisted Macari. ‘Because at one stage that looked a long shot.

‘Being the type of character he is, he has battled his way through it. He is now back playing and will be delighted to be vice-captain. That, though, is not the priority. The priority was to get back and into contention for the first team.

‘Time doesn’t wait for you when you are out for that length of time. Other people come along and try to take your place. It is a real struggle to get back into the team but Darren has met it head-on.

‘The new manager clearly believes there is still a good, long future for him. Everyone was under pressure when van Gaal came in. Everyone was tested.

‘But Darren was perhaps under more pressure because he knew he had lost a year or more from football.

‘When he returned at the back end of last year, he was alright but he wasn’t the Darren we knew before.

‘Gradually, though, with a bit more fitness under his belt he has restored that ability to get around the pitch.

‘I counted the other day that there are 13 or 14 players looking to get into United’s midfield. That is some competition, but he has come through and got a place at the start of the season. It’s remarkable stuff.’

As you might suspect, Macari has boundless admiration for the relentless determination Fletcher has shown over the past few years.

‘Unless you have that illness then I don’t think you can appreciate the impact of it. It’s not a broken leg or a hamstring tear, this almost brought Darren’s life to a standstill.

‘But he fought back with everything he had and anything he gets from here on is thoroughly deserved.

‘A lot of players might not even have considered trying to fight back. At Darren’s age, it’s fair to say these guys are well and truly financially secure.

‘It is all credit to him that he wanted so badly to get back on the pitch. Not to earn a new contract or more money – but to play football at the top level. ‘Other players might not have been able to handle what Darren has been through and called it a day. There was no chance of that with Darren.’

The role as one of van Gaal’s dressing room lieutenants should come easily to Fletcher. A United man to his core, he could be a valuable sounding board for the Dutchman as he seeks to revive the club following the turmoil of David Moyes’ brief and ill-fated reign.

‘Darren has been at the club with Sir Alex (Ferguson) for such a long time and knows what is expected,’ said Macari.

‘We are not just talking about performances on the pitch but about conducting yourself in the right way. About being a true professional.

‘That background has been so important to Darren. Without his way of thinking, this comeback may not have happened.’

Fletcher’s continued progress is also a significant boon to Gordon Strachan as Scotland prepare to begin their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against world champions Germany in Dortmund next month.

The midfielder made his first appearance under Strachan as a second-half substitute during the 1-0 friendly win over Poland in March.

Now, though, it seems the national side may be able to call upon a player who has moved far closer to his previous capabilities.

‘Without a doubt, having a fit and on-form Darren Fletcher would be a huge boost for Scotland,’ insisted Macari.

‘Without being disrespectful to anyone else, we don’t have a large number of top players in Darren’s mould. He has proved himself over the years.

‘Hopefully, he can keep progressing and play a real part for the national team in this next campaign. A Scotland with Darren Fletcher is certainly better than one without him.’
