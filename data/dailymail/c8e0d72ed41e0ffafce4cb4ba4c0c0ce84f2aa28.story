She might not have had the best Christmas thanks to the tragic death of her grandmother, but Irina Shayk appears to be overcoming adversity in style.

Photos from her latest campaign, for American swimwear brand Beach Bunny, show the 28-year-old at her glamorous best, posing on a tropical beach in a succession of teeny bikinis.

The campaign is the latest in a series of career coups for the Russian model, who last year, appeared in editorial features in a host of prestigious magazines as well as on the cover of Spanish Vogue.

The model is also due to make her film debut later this year when she appears in Hercules: The Thracian Wars as Megara, the vengeful wife of the eponymous hero, played by The Rock.

But, as these photos prove, she won't be giving up her modelling career in the near future - and even managed to make some of the more dubious designs look good.

Particularly outré was an antique gold number, which could have come direct from the costume department of Hercules: The Thracian Wars, and came complete with bling straps encrusted with turquoise stones.

In better taste was a cobalt Grecian number that boasted a smattering of pretty beading and a relatively restrained black and silver option.

The designer behind the brand is Californian Angela Chittenden, a former swimwear model herself, who says the idea for her own label arose after she was unable to find beachwear to suit.

'Either they were too conservative with too much coverage, or they weren’t very classy,' she complains in an interview on the Beach Bunny website.

'There was nothing out there that was sexy and elegant. So I decided to design my own.'

Having concluded that 'sexy cuts' with copious embellishment were the future of swimwear, she launched her label in 2004.

'Some people said I was crazy, that my designs were too risky, too out-there to catch on,' she adds. 'I guess they were wrong.'
