She arrived for her annual summer break at Balmoral just five days after the Royal baby was born.

And now, almost two weeks later, the Queen appears to have relaxed into her two month holiday with ease.

She was greeted by hordes of well-wishers as she inspected the troops outside the gates of Balmoral today as she arrived to take up official residence.

She had landed in Scotland more than a week earlier, on 27 June, when she arrived by private aeroplane with her two corgis, Holly and Willow, for the break.

Jolly good show! The Queen inspects the Royal Scots Borderers at the gates to Balmoral as she takes up summer residence there

Until now, she had been staying in 
one of the other houses on the estate before the tourist season came to 
and end on 31 July and the main residence could be prepared for her 
arrival.

Dressed in a 
powder blue suit and hat trimmed with a statement bloom, she looked 
delighted with what she saw as the pipers struck up in her honour.

The Queen traditionally spends the 
entire summer in her Scottish residence, and is customarily joined for 
the whole duration by Prince Philip, with other members of the Royal 
family dropping in for portions of the break.

Philip
 is set to join the Queen at her private estate on Monday, after 
carrying out his first public engagement two months since he was 
admitted to the London Clinic on 6 June for exploratory abdominal 
surgery.

It will be the Duke of Edinburgh's first official engagement since the surgery.

Philip, 92, will travel to Edinburgh where he will hand out medals at the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Buckingham Palace said.

Others
 who may join the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh include William and 
Kate, who it has been suggested may decide to holiday at Balmoral, 
travelling there from Bucklebury in Buckinghamshire where they are 
currently spending family time at the Middleton's mansion.

No wonder she's cheerful - the Queen will now remain at her beloved private estate until October
