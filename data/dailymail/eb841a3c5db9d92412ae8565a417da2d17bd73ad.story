A motorist has been filmed dicing with death as she swerves on to the wrong side of the road to race through a level crossing while the barriers come down above her head.

Daniella Nelson, 25, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention after the shocking incident was filmed in Cambridge in September last year.

Nelson overtook a silver Fiesta that was already parked in front of the crossing, ignoring red flashing lights and a klaxon in order to get to the other side.

Magistrate Stephen Baxter said: 'A horrific accident could have taken place because of this.

'The aggravating feature in this case is that you were actually overtaking on the other side when the red warning lights were on and the barriers were coming down.'

Magistrates watched shocking CCTV stills of the incident and ordered her to pay a fine of £280 plus £58 in costs and a victim surcharge.

British Transport Police Sergeant Joe McClenaghan said: 'Drivers who willingly flout the law, placing themselves and others in danger, should be aware that if caught doing so, we will do everything in our power to prosecute those responsible.'

Nelson was banned from driving for a year after admitting driving without due care and attention

Foxton crossing, where the incident took place, is one of the most misused crossings in the country

The level crossing at Foxton is said to have one of the highest levels of misuse by drivers in the country.

In 2010 and 2011, the BTP recorded 91 incidents of motorists driving illegally at the crossing.

Network Rail are currently holding a consultation on replacing the existing crossing with either a bridge or a tunnel underneath the line.

Building the bridge alone is expected to cost around £14million.
