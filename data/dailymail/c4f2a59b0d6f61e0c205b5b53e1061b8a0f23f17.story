Detectives have launched a search for the unique-looking Antoine Petty, who is wanted in connection with gun crimes.

But it seems however hard the 30-year-old tries to hide, he will not be too difficult to miss.

As mugshots released by police go, this tattoo-covered suspect certainly stands out from the crowd.

Distinguishing features: Antoine Petty, 30, is being hunted by police in Maryland for stealing a gun

The photo was released by Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland in a bid for information on the whereabouts of the inked suspect.

He is accused of stealing a gun from an acquaintance last week in Largo, Maryland.

He has a number of patterns on his face, including a crucifix on his forehead, a balloon on his left cheek and a smiley face on the tip of his nose.

The distinguishing features also include the word 'destini' on his chin, the letters 'XWWH' before his hair line, and facial hair.

Officers said: 'Our detectives would like your help in finding this unique looking suspect. He's wanted for stealing a gun from an acquaintance in Largo on April 7, 2014. 

'The suspect is identified as 30-year-old Antoine Petty. Petty is known to frequent the Largo and Forestville areas.'

It is not yet known whether he has been located.
