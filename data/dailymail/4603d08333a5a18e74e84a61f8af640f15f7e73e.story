Chancellor George Osborne (pictured)has said that no new tax rises will be needed after the election to fund his plans

Families face a huge tax bombshell whoever wins the general election, experts warned last night.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned voters to brace themselves for a £5 billion tax rise after the election in May – equal to a 1p in the pound increase in the headline rate of VAT or income tax.

Chancellor George Osborne has said that no new tax rises will be needed after the election to fund his plans, with the remainder of the deficit reduction programme coming from big cuts to welfare and spending.

Most of Labour’s publicly announced tax rises have already been earmarked for spending on particular issues, such as the NHS, rather than reducing the deficit. 

But neither party has completely ruled out a rise in VAT.

The Lib Dems will today break ranks by threatening ‘at least’ £8billion of tax increases after the election, but has not yet spelled out in full where they will fall. 

The IFS warned that the first year after each of the last five elections has seen tax increases totalling £5billion at today’s prices, whichever party has won.

Paul Johnson, the respected think-tank’s director, suggested neither of the main parties may be telling the full truth about their tax plans.

Asked whether the IFS was predicting tax rises following the election, Mr Johnson said: ‘Are we saying that tax rises are inevitable? No. 

The e IFS warned that the first year after each of the last five elections has seen hikes totalling £5billion at today's prices, whichever party has won

'Are we saying that tax rises have tended to happen after elections and there is a big gap to fill? Yes.

‘I don’t know whether the next government will do but I wouldn’t fall off my stool if there were some tax rises there.’ 

A report by the IFS, the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in Britain, said the main options for raising significant tax revenues would be increases in VAT, income tax or National Insurance.

British families are set to enjoy their best year since 2001 thanks to rising wages, falling petrol prices and bock-bottom interest rates, a leading economist has said.

Andrew Goodwin, senior UK economist at forecasters Oxford Economics, said consumer spending would pick up by more than 3% this year, as families find they have more money to splash out.

And he said that the outlook for business was 'very positive', with strong profitability and confidence about demand encouraging investment by companies which are sitting on 'the largest piles of cash for 15 to 20 years' after pulling in their horns in the wake of the recession.

Growth in investment could top 5% this year, he said.

Mr Goodwin made his optimistic forecast at the launch of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' annual Green Budget, produced in collaboration with Oxford Economics.

It said increasing any of these would ‘weaken work incentives’. Other options include big rises in fuel duty, business rates or corporation tax.

The IFS also questioned whether the parties would be able to focus tax rises on the rich, warning that tax revenues are already ‘highly concentrated’, with the top 3 per cent of taxpayers contributing half of all income tax.

The warning came as the IFS launched its ‘Green Budget’, its annual assessment of the economy and the public finances ahead of the Budget.

Economists predicted rising wages and falling inflation will leave the average voter more than £400 better off this year.

They said plummeting oil prices, combined with the economic recovery, would produce a ‘real turnaround in household finances’ this year – providing the biggest boost to personal income since 2001. 

But they warned that the sickly public finances left behind by the last Labour government will need further major surgery after the election.

The IFS said Tory plans to balance the books would require the biggest package of cuts among the world’s leading 32 industrialised nations, outpacing even those pencilled in for austerity-hit Greece.

It said cuts on this scale would be ‘difficult’ to achieve and would require up to 900,000 job losses in the public sector. 

The report found the Coalition has achieved just over half of the cuts needed, with 45 per cent still to go.

But the think-tank also warned that Labour’s plans, which involve smaller cuts, would saddle Britain with an extra £170billion of debt. 

The study said Labour would already be borrowing an extra £27billion a year by now if it had won the election.

The Tories seized on the findings as evidence Labour could not be trusted with the economy.

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The independent experts say that Labour’s policy would mean £10,000 more borrowing for every household in Britain – more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’

In 2010 the coalition increased VAT to 20 per cent, despite the Lib Dems vowing not to do so before election
