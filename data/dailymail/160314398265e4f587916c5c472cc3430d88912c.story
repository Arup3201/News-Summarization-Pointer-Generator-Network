It’s meant to safeguard staff on railway lines but this worker used a high-visibility orange jacket to save a swan stranded on the tracks.

The bird had flown on to the line at rush-hour this morning and was in danger from passing trains at Lincoln Central station.

The rail worker clambered onto the track when there was a break in services but it took another 15 minutes to get close as the scared bird kept moving down the line.

Then, 
finally, he was able to scoop up the swan in the bright orange hi-vis 
coat in one of the images captured by trainspotter Michael Eppinger, 64.

He said: ‘I had been at the station since 8.15am and then all of a sudden there was this swan on the track.

‘Somebody had to go on the line to get it, which they did in the end.

‘When I left they were waiting for somebody to come and collect it.’

The powerful bird was kept wrapped up safely in the jacket until it could be collected by a rescue centre.

Meanwhile, the M6 had to be closed in both directions after a swan wandered on to the busy carriageway.

The swan landed on the M6 near Preston in Lancashire on Saturday and caused traffic chaos for motorists

The bird had become separated from its flock when it landed on the northbound carriageway near Preston in Lancashire.

Motorists faced queues of traffic while officers from North West Motorway Police attempted to remove the swan.

The force tweeted: '(We) found the swan and are attempting to get it to leave the carriageway.'

They later posted: 'The swan has very kindly agreed to leave the carriageway, M6 is now flowing freely.'

One motorist tweeted: 'I found it pretty amusing watching @HAtraffic-nwest trying to remove a swan off the M6.'

A
 Highways Agency spokesman said during the incident: 'We have 
temporarily stopped the carriageway in both directions whilst we deal 
with a swan in the carriageway.'

The bird was seized by officers and safely returned to a nearby canal on Saturday.
