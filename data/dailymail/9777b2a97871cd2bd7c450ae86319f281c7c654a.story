After eight years missing, living on the streets and battling the elements, returning to the safe haven of home should be a welcome relief.

But not for adventurous moggy Thomas, the black tom cat.

After nearly a decade on the run, the pet cat gave his owner Elizabeth Shaw a surprise after the pair were reunited - sinking his sharp teeth into her hand 10 times, leaving her needing hospital treatment.

Thomas the cat returned to his Dalkeith home in February after eight years on the run. But after getting itchy feet again this week, the black and white cat lashed out at owner Elizabeth Shaw, biting her 10 times

He disappeared from the mother-of-two's Dalkeith home in Midlothian, Scotland in 2005. And so Ms Shaw was amazed when she was reunited with her treasured pet in February.

But after two months at home, Thomas started to get itchy feet once more, disappearing on Wednesday for 24 hours.

When the 13-year-old black and white moggy returned and Ms Shaw spotted him lurking in her garden she went to grab him, fearing he would wander off again.

But Thomas did not take kindly to having his independence taken away, and lashed out, turning and sinking his sharp teeth into Ms Shaw's right hand.

He bit the 45-year-old 10 times, drawing blood and causing an infection that resulted in Ms Shaw being admitted to the Royal Infirmary Hospital in Edinburgh.

She said doctors have warned her she could require an operation to clear the infection, if it fails to clear up.

Despite Thomas's dramatic return home, Ms Shaw has said the fact he is home is 'all that matters'.

The 45-year-old mother-of-two (right) suffered 10 bite wounds, which got infected. She was taken to the Royal Infirmary Hospital in Edinburgh where medics warned her she might need an operation to clear the infection

She said: 'That big boy Thomas of mine hasnâ€™t half caused me pain this week. In hospital now waiting on orthopaedic surgeon.

'Getting kept in got nasty infection with cat bites. If no better by today have to get operation to flush out the infection in the joints.

'Have to stay in for three days - OMG.'

She added: 'I tried to get him in the house so just grabbed him. He bit me 10 times and I had to come home from work.'

Thomas reappeared in February after he was befriended by a woman in nearby Bonnyrigg.

A cat rescue charity realised he was microchipped and was eventually able to reunite him with Ms Shaw.
