A suspect in two violent rapes in Boston a decade ago has been freed because DNA testing could not differentiate him from his identical twin brother.

Dwayne McNair, 33, was freed by a judge on Tuesday after spending two years behind bars awaiting trial for the rapes of two women, aged 19 and 23.

Prosecutors said they plan to conduct additional DNA testing using a $120,000 new test developed by a German company that can distinguish between identical twins and could separate Dwayne from his identical twin Dwight.

The 33-year-old McNair's lawyer said that his client realizes he's not in the clear yet. The complex DNA testing could take months to complete.

Another man, Anwar Thomas, has already pleaded guilty to the rapes and implicated McNair as a co-conspirator in 2012.

Prosecutors said two women, aged 19 and 23, were abducted at gunpoint off city streets within nine days of each other in 2004, pistol-whipped and raped.

The 23-year-old was grabbed from the Forest Hills neighborhood of Boston on September 21, 2004. She was forced into a car and repeatedly raped in a garage before being dumped in Franklin Park.

Days later, a 19-year-old woman was walking home in Mission Hill when she was kidnapped by two men at gunpoint, dragged into a car and pistol-whipped. She was repeatedly raped in Franklin Park.

The courageous victim managed to save a condom used by her attacker which later became DNA evidence.

According to court documents, a long-running police investigation finally identified McNair as a suspect in 2007. However although he fitted the DNA profile, detectives were unable to arrest him because his twin brother had exactly the same profile when their semen samples were tested.

McNair was indicted in 2012 â€¨after Thomas said McNair was involved, according to the Boston Herald. McNairâ€™s had been jailed on $3.3 million bail since that time.

Thomas is due to be sentenced next month and will get a maximum of 16 years if he cooperates with authorities.
