Innovative website Hello Sunday Morning (HSM) is creating a new mobile app funded by one of the world's leading mobile telecommunications companies, the Vodafone Foundation, to help combat alcohol problems amongst Australia’s young people.

HSM encourages individuals to take a break from drinking and recreate the drinking culture within Australia. Since 2010, over 32,000 people have signed up to go three months or more without alcohol, and blog about their journey.

The introduction of the new app is the organisation’s latest initiative and HMS founder and CEO, Chris Raine, believes it can help even more those battling the booze.

HSM founder and CEO, Chris Raine, sees huge potential in the new app

'What we’re building now with the support of the Vodafone Foundation is a mobile app that will distil the essence of what our process is, and make it accessible to a much larger group of people who are determined to change their lifestyle,' he said.

Dr Nick Carah, who is a lecturer in communications at the University of Queensland, also felt the app will work as it'll help promote HSM's way of changing individuals’ alcohol consumption behaviour.

'When HSM builds tools like this mobile app it will get people to interact with their smartphone and use HSM’s programme as a support mechanism for themselves,' he said.

'Participants currently document their on-going journey on the HSM blog, giving advice and support to others.

'This is where the new app will make a difference, because it’ll become integrated more in people’s every-day lives. Rather than having to sit down and write a blog post people can more easily share with each other.

'It’s a much more seamless support network that can be used in everyday life. It’ll always be there when they need it.'

Those currently benefiting most from HSM are younger, female drinkers. A huge binge drinker from the age of 16-29, Nicole Cliff, knew that she had to make changes in her life. She found HSM online two years ago and it immediately made a big impact.

'I used the site for motivation and support. I also set myself a goal, which was to make the Melbourne ice hockey team,' the 31-year-old said.

'So I actually used the time not drinking positively, and I made the team. From then on my life has completely changed for the better.'

Cliff said that the new app would be the perfect way to help young people dealing with alcohol problems.

One-on-one counselling used in conventional treatment programmes is not for everyone

'Everyone has their phones on them these days so the app would be perfect. If you are at a party and feel tempted you only have to get straight on your phone and use the app to seek some support. People need to feel supported for change to happen,' she said. 

Four years ago Raine, 27, was working in advertising and drinking heavily. But instead of using the likes of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to get over his problem he decided to not drink for a year and write a blog every week called Hello Sunday Morning to share his experiences and deal with his issues. 

'It gradually grew a following of people who got encouragement from it and decided it was something they’d also like to do,' he explained. 'It was then I quit my job, set up an NGO and developed this free online programme that has grown organically each year to help breed a better drinking culture.

'The big idea behind it is that one-on-one counselling is not for everyone, so we provide a community-based peer-to-peer process where people can support each other. We've now surpassed AA in terms of the number of people in their programme in Australia.'

Many young drinkers are too embarrassed to speak with a doctor or a healthcare professional

HMS has been successful partly because it established a platform technically that’s very accessible and straightforward for young people. It also doesn't have the stigma of going to a doctor or a healthcare professional, you can do it privately.

The other element is that unlike other treatment programmes where people have to say they are an alcoholic or have a drinking problem, HSM gets individuals to nominate a goal that has nothing to do with drinking. This gives participants something to focus on and a story to tell that does not revolve around alcohol.
