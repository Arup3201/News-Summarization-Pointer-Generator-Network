A test used for heart disease is 'flawed' and may be leading to thousands of patients being given the wrong treatment, an expert has warned.

Professor Nick Curzen said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients.

The tests, called angiograms, involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart.

Flawed: According to Professor Curzen, angiograms are inaccurate in 26 per cent of cases

A dye is then passed through the tube while a series of x-rays are taken which show up any blockages in the arteries.

Professor Curzen, a consultant cardiologist at Southampton General Hospital, said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted.

He said angiograms should be used alongside another procedure which involves inserting a tiny wire into arteries which measure the blood pressure.

Professor Curzen carried out a trial on 200 patients which showed that angiograms led to the wrong treatment in 26 per cent of cases.

During the trial patients were given angiograms and doctors then decided on their treatment. They then underwent the second procedure, a fractional flow reserve test, and doctors were asked if they would change the treatment. In 26 per cent of cases they did.

Faulty: The test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but doesn't always get it right

Professor Curzen said: 'The results indicate management of patients with stable angina by angiogram alone is probably flawed and treatment would be much more tailored to the individual through routine use of a FFR pressure test at the diagnostic stage.'

He now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a 'major change' in the way tests are done.

About one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties.

It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy, tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck.

Angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated.Â 

Patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them.
