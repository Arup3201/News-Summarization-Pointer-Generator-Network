Riot police fired tear gas at thousands of Greek protesters today as they took to the streets to protests against the Government's austerity measures.

Ahead of a keynote speech by the Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, more than 17,000 angry citizens were dispersed by officers in the city of Thessaloniki.

Police said that they came under attack from protesters using flare guns, stones, sticks and even a petrol bomb, and they arrested two people while detaining another 100. Two people were injured.

In Athens, police fired stun grenades to
disperse around 400 protesters who tried to block a main road outside 
Parliament. The protesters retaliated with firebombs that they lobbed at
officers over passing traffic.

They were protesting against Mr Papandreou's Socialist government's austerity measures which include cutting pensions and salaries while raising
taxes and retirement ages.

Speaking this evening, Mr Papandreou promised to meet ambitious fiscal targets for 2011 and save the debt-crippled country from bankruptcy.

He also pledged to press on with vital reforms to improve fiscal discipline and secure continued payment of international rescue loans.

In a nationally televised address he said: 'We will push through all the major changes our country has needed for years.

'And we will take whatever other decisions are needed, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the country on its feet.'

Papandreou added that his main concern was to keep the country solvent.

'We don't have the right to abandon this effort halfway through,' he said. 'Because if it remains half-done, (our) sacrifices will have been in vain.'

This came despite Finance minister Evangelos Venizelos being forced to deny rumours about that the nation's impending bankruptcy.

Venizelos insisted that the country could still pull through, although the proof would not come in the immediate future.

He said: 'Whoever believes that Greece has been broken or has no hope is clearly out of touch with reality,' he said.

'The two coming months are crucial 
for the very existence of our country, these are two months whose every 
day counts as a year in terms of effort.'

By
the end of October, Greece has to conclude talks on a complex bond swap
deal under which private holders of its debt - mostly banks and pension
funds - will take a loss on their holdings in return for new, more 
secure bonds.

It must also 
persuade the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which 
are providing the bailout loans, that it is making sufficient progress 
with fiscal discipline, reforms and privatisations.

If Athens fails in that, the country will not receive the next eight billion batch of euro loans, and go bankrupt in weeks.

Meanwhile,
Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Germans to have patience with 
Greece, drawing a parallel between the financial reforms that Greeks 
need to implement and Germany's reunification process two decades ago.

Merkel
told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspapers that Athens must keep up 
with reforms if Greece is to continue to receive support, but conceded 
change would not happen 'overnight.'

She
compared the process in Greece to that of unifying the former East and 
West German nations in the 1990s, recalling how long it took 'to build 
up new bureaucratic structures, to dissemination information and to 
privatize.'

Merkel said: 'We must be patient.'
