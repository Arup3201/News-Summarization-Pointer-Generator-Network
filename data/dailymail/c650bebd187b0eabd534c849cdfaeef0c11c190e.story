Perhaps it’s all down  to her fledgling romance  with her dashing stock- broker boyfriend.

Or maybe it has something to do with her younger brother James’s new relationship with television presenter Donna Air.

Whatever the case, love was clearly on Pippa Middleton’s mind when she wrote her most recent recipe instalment for Waitrose – a ‘romantic picnic for two’.

In the piece, the socialite sister of the Duchess of Cambridge extols the benefits of ‘whisk[ing] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing’.

Picnic time: If your name happens to be Pippa 
Middleton, the humble strawberry jam sandwich simply 
doesn't cut the mustard on a spring picnic, as you'll discover in the new edition of Waitrose Kitchen

The 29-year-old’s Provencal Picnic menu includes peach and vanilla fizz, a fig and goat’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with Provence – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars.

But frankly it would be cheaper – never mind easier – to head to a nice restaurant. Because to buy all the ingredients from Waitrose and cook the meal from scratch would cost almost £100 for two people.

That figure is based on the first  relevant choices available on the supermarket’s website, ranked in terms of popularity.

If you follow Miss Middleton’s advice, you would also need to  invest in tea towels ‘with French stripes’, enamel plates  and quilted rugs, adding £85  to the total.

For the utmost authenticity, you’d need to fly to Provence, too – a snip at £1,014 for two people, based on a return flight with British Airways.

Even without a trip away, anyone attempting their own version of her latest ‘Friday Night Feast’ would be advised to take the day off – it takes at least two and a half hours to prepare.

Fragrant: One of Pippa's recipes calls for dried lavender. Unfortunately, the flower is not available at Waitrose

Tasty: According to Pippa, her strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars will be a hit with your man

Despite this Miss Middleton, who is dating stockbroker  Nico Jackson, 35, still advises readers to ‘quickly prep, pack, then whisk away someone special’.

Her tips are unlikely to go down well with hard-working mothers, or indeed anyone who works full-time.

Miss Middleton became  the face of Waitrose after the company ditched Delia Smith when her three-year contract ended in January.

Her first column for Waitrose Kitchen magazine caused controversy because of the price of the ingredients involved.

In this month’s column, her second, Miss Middleton waxes lyrical as she describes how her menu is inspired by Provence.

She writes: ‘Here’s my vision of the perfect picnic. I’m in Provence, in a field just off the beaten track, where we’ve parked the car and thrown a quilted rug across the dry, parched grasses.

Fight back: Delia has said she won't cook any of Pippa's recipes, as featured in Waitrose Kitchen magazine

‘The hazy sky is cobalt blue, cicadas hum around us and it’s hot, very hot. But not too hot for a picnic.

'Around us are plump peaches, figs and strawberries, oozing ripe cheeses and crunchy baguettes, torn and ready to mop up every last morsel.’

A spokesman for Waitrose said  the menu cost £57.13, based on its own calculations. That figure used prices for whole packs of ingredients.

It added up to £23.83 if only the quantities required were taken into account.

She added: ‘Typically many of our customers would have some of the basic store cupboard ingredients – so their shopping lists would be considerably cheaper.

'Our shoppers are savvy and will typically shop across our different ranges when buying ingredients for recipes.’

She said that the Daily Mail had chosen ‘many of the expensive options’. The Mail chose the most popular items, in the smallest size packs available.

PEACH AND VANILLA FIZZ

'A subtle aperitif with a hint of lemon and vanilla,' says Pippa. 'The base can be topped up with lemonade instead of sparkling water or wine, and any leftovers can be frozen in ice cube trays for another day - they'll keep in the freezer for up to a month.
