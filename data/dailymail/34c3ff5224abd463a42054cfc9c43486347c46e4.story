The woman beheaded by a Muslim convert was a grandmother who had lost her home in a tornado, it emerged today. 

Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, who apparently were attacked randomly at the Vaughan Foods facility in Moore on Thursday, after he was fired from his job 

Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado.

Her neighbours described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed. 

Today it was revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. 

According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported.

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time.

'Killer': The suspect  reportedly beheaded Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbed Traci Johnson, 43, before he was shot and wounded by off-duty sheriff's deputy and firm CEO Mark Vaughan. Above, Nolen reads the Koran

Because of credits, he was able to complete all three prison sentences in just two years and he was released on March 22, 2013, records show.

'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday.

'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections. 

'If it's not an 85 percent crime, we have no idea how long a person will actually spend in prison,' Prater said. 

Nolen was shot by sheriff's deputy Mark Vaughan, who is also the firm's CEO.  

In prayer: It has emerged that Nolen (seen praying) apparently celebrated terrorism, promoted Islam and disparaged non-Muslims in a series of posts on Facebook in the months leading up to the alleged killing

At work: Meanwhile, in another, he uploaded a photo of the Joker with a message criticising the 'wicked' U.S. for not helping the people of Gaza against Israel. Above, Nolen is pictured loading food onto a shelf at work

In custody: Over a one-year period, Nolen also apparently posted images of Osama bin Laden, deadly weaponry, a poster reading 'Islam will dominate the world' and children learning how to shoot guns

Islamic convert: Other posts saw Nolen reading the Koran, donning Muslim religious clothing (pictured), praying in a mosque and seemingly performing the one-figure salute of the Islamic State terror group

He has now regained consciousness and was interviewed by detectives Saturday.

Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said that Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon and that he may also face federal charges.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Saturday that Nolen was a frequent worshipper at a mosque the group maintains and that he remembers the suspect as 'a little weird.'

'He was a nice, quiet, low-key guy,' said Saad Mohammed, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City.  

Scene: On Friday, 911 calls revealed the panic of employees, with a caller telling the dispatcher: 'They're in the office, front office of the building. Yeah, we can hear a lot of screaming. Above, the scene at Vaughan Foods

'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags.'

Mohammed said Nolen began worshipping at one of the group's mosques in May.

He says Nolen wasn't outgoing and that his behavior didn't raise any red flags. 

He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News.

Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center.

Once inside, he attacked 54-year-old Colleen Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. 

Nolen then repeatedly stabbed 43-year-old Traci Johnson before Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer, shot him, police said.

Johnson was treated for her injuries at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was released Saturday, said Varina Shellman, clinical coordinator for the medical center.

Lewis said Johnson was also interviewed Saturday.

Police learned Nolen was fired for 'numerous reasons' involving 'personnel issues,' Lewis said, adding that he didn't know the specifics.

Police asked the FBI to help investigate Nolen after co-workers told investigators he had recently started trying to convert several employees to Islam. Lewis said police asked the FBI to look into Nolen's background because of the nature of the attack, which followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants.

Mohammed said Nolen had attended services where sermons were delivered condemning such attacks.

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' Mohammed said.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge James E. Finch said the motive for the attack had not been determined, but that there is no reason to believe there was a threat to anyone else.

'We don't have any reason to believe there is any danger to the area,' Lewis said.

According to Oklahoma Department of Corrections records, Nolen served time in prison and is on probation for assault and battery of a police officer. He also was convicted of cocaine possession with the intent to distribute in 2011.

The records show that Nolen has what appear to be religious tattoos, including one referencing Jesus and one in Arabic that means 'peace be with you.'
