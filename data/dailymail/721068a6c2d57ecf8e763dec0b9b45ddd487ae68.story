The head of Burkina Faso's armed forces took power today after President Blaise Compaore resigned amid mass demonstrations against an attempt to extend his 27-year rule that military chief General Honore Traore had taken over the reins of power.

Compaore, who seized power in a 1987 coup, had attempted to defy popular pressure for him to step down after a day of violent protests on Thursday in which demonstrators stormed parliament and state television.

However, with hundreds of thousands of protesters packing the streets of the capital Ouagadougou for a second day today and no sign of international support for him staying on, Compaore announced his resignation. 

'I declare that I'm leaving power in order to have a free and transparent election in 90 days,' said Compaore in a statement read out on television and radio stations. 'For my part, I think I have fulfilled my duty.'  

A heavily armed convoy believed to be carrying Compaore was seen today travelling towards the southern town of Po, near the border with Ghana, two diplomatic sources and local media said.

Crowds danced and cheered in Ougadougou's dusty streets, blowing on whistles after Compaore's statement was broadcast. 

But the mood cooled as it became plain that military chief General Honore Traore had taken over the reins of power. 

Under Burkina Faso's constitution, when the president resigns the head of the National Assembly should take office, but parliament had already been dissolved by Traore on Thursday under short-lived martial law. 

For months, an opposition coalition has been urging Compaore not to seek re-election for what would have been his fifth term in power.  

But he and his ruling party looked set to push a bill through Parliament on Thursday that would have allowed him to run again.

Determined to block the vote, protesters stormed the building, the vote was suspended and the military announced the legislature had been dissolved and a transition government would be formed. After that Compaore said he would lead until the new elections.

But protesters rejected that plan and gathered again Friday, demanding that Compaore step down immediately. 

'Considering the urgency of saving the nation, I have decided that I will assume from this day the responsibility of the head of state,' Traore told a news conference.

'I undertake a solemn engagement to proceed without delay with consultations with all parties in the country so as to start the process of returning to the constitutional order as soon as possible.'

There was no immediate reaction from opposition leaders to Traore's announcement.

Many protesters said they wanted a transition led by retired General Kouame Lougue, a popular former defence minister who was accused of trying to topple Compaore in 2004.

Long a bastion of stability in the turbulent Sahel region, Burkina Faso's crisis is being closely watched by military allies France and the United States, and by governments in the region where several long-standing rulers are approaching the end of their mandates amid rumbling of popular discontent.

'This is a sub-Saharan Spring and it must continue against all the presidents who are trying to hang on to power in Africa,' said law student Lucien Trinnou, referring to the Arab Spring that toppled several long-term leaders.

French President Francois Hollande, who had discretely sought ways to usher Compaore into an international role when his term was due to have ended next year, welcomed the former president's resignation in a statement and called for quick elections to be held.

Burkina Faso is one of the world's poorest nations but has positioned itself as a mediator in regional crises. It is also a key ally in Western operations against al Qaeda-linked groups in West Africa and one of the last African states to retain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

Regional West African bloc ECOWAS said on Thursday it would not accept any party seizing power through non-constitutional means in an apparent suggestion of diplomatic pressure to leave Compaore in place.

A delegation from the African Union, the United Nations and ECOWAS was due in Burkina Faso on Friday to hold talks with all parties.
