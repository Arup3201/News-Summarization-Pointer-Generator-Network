Michael Ballack believes that the current Germany squad is their best for 20 years, but that they need to win something in order to prove themselves at the highest level.

Joachim Low's side are set to face Portugal in their World Cup opener on Monday and, according to The Times, Ballack has warned his fellow countrymen that 'being talented is not enough.'

The Germans haven't won a major piece of silverware since the European championships in 1996, and the last of their three World Cup triumphs came in 1990.

The closest they have come in recent times was in 2002, when a Ballack-inspired side made it all the way to the final, before falling 2-0 to Brazil - a game from which the midfielder was unfortunately suspended.

But he believes that, despite some shortcomings, the current crop have what it takes to challenge in Brazil.

'From my point of view, this is the best group of players Germany have had for 20 years, better than any of the teams I played in, including the one who reached the 2002 World cup final.

'We had great squads in the 1970s and 1990s, but in terms of talent this one is comparable.

'To be a great generation, however, you have to win something. Being talented is not enough.

'There are other things that worry me beyond the question of mentality, and [Joachim] Low has some big decisions to make when picking his starting XI.

'That is one of the side-effects of having so many good players.'
