Two months after their son's death at the hands of Islamic State jihadists, the parents of James Foley paid a tearful tribute to the journalist today during a ceremony in northwestern France.

Diane and John Foley arrived at the memorial for fallen war reporters in Bayeux to honor those who have died in war zones in 2014.

During an emotional speech they urged the public not to forget that 'information is vital' and said they hoped James, who was murdered in August, 'did not die in vain'.

Remembrance: Mrs Foley holds her hand up to her face and her husband looks away as the members of the audience read the names of 51 journalists who have been killed so far in 2014

The couple unveiled a stone honoring the fallen reporters alongside Maryvonne Lepage, the mother of Camille Lepage, 28 a freelance photographer who was murdered in the Central African Republic in May. 

The Bayeux-Calvados journalism awards were created in 1994 in honour of the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing.

Christophe Deloire , Secretary General of Reporters without Borders, said: 'Obviously, this year 2014 will be remembered for the ignominious character beheadings of journalists... with up to abyss and threats following the hostage, it is the height of ignominy.

'The number of journalists killed in 2014 is already extremely high - 51 - after 71 throughout the year 2013 and a sad record in 2012 (88).'

Foley, who died on August 19 aged 40, began his career teaching basic reading and writing skills to inmates of a Chicago prison.

He switched to journalism in 2007 and admitted he was 'pretty much hooked' when a Washington Post reporter told him it was possible for a freelance to cover war zones.

After journalism school, he set off to report in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria.

Foley was kidnapped in 2012 while covering the Syrian uprising. The Islamic State group posted a Web video showing his killing.

In the letter, Foley says he held with 17 other hostages, and they passed the time by discussing movies, sports and trivia and playing games made up of scraps found in their jail cell. 

Victim: James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants in August at the age of 40. He had spent years as a freelance reporter covering conflicts in the Middle East and was captured in Syria in 2012

During an interview in September, Diane Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at efforts to rescue her son from captivity.

Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, Mrs Foley said her son 'was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.'

'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' said Diane Foley. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.'

Another American journalist Steven Sotloff and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning, have since been executed  by the militant group in Syria.

'At AFP we cover conflicts for decades, but we did not feel as vulnerable as in parts of Syria, where it has become too dangerous to even consider the practice of true journalism ,' said Philip Chetwynd, editor-in- Chief of the AFP central .

He added: 'James Foley was for many of us to AFP a friend,' he has added a tribute to the quality of work of each of the six other journalists.'
