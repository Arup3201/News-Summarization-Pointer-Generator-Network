The White House pressured its allies to provide pro bono legal aid to unaccompanied minors today.

With Congress out of session and legislation to provide emergency funding to immigration agencies stalled, the White House is leaning on immigration advocates to help provide legal services to immigrant children going through deportation proceedings.

The White House hosted approximately 60 law firms and nonprofits today to discuss ways groups can help reduce the burden on the government and make sure unaccompanied minors receive legal counsel.

The situation at the border is 'the single most significant, heart-wrenching and divisive thing that’s happening in terms of the immigration debate right now,' Vice President Joe Biden told attendees.

According to the White House, fewer than half of illegal immigrant children have proper legal representative, putting them at a disadvantage when they appear before immigration courts.

Already the White House has deployed a government program to train lawyers and paralegals to represent children facing deported, but immigration groups say the program will affect a small portion of minors scheduled to appear in court.

Since last October a surge of more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors have illegally entered the United States and the federal government expects as many as 90,000 to arrive at the border by the end of the year.

Children who identify themselves as Mexican can be immediately sent back to their home country, but those coming from non-contiguous countries to the U.S. must be afforded due process before they can be repatriated.

Courts now face a backlog of more than 375,000 immigration, including those of unaccompanied minors, and illegal immigrants wait up to three years for a hearing.

The governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have asked the U.S. to make a special exception in refugee laws for children coming from their countries due to the prevalence of violence.The White House has resisted those efforts, however.

'If the measure we’re going to use as to 
whether or not asylum is granted is if you’re better off in America than
 you are someplace else, well there’s at least 800 million kids who are 
eligible,' Biden told immigration advocates today.

'That’s where you all come in,' he told attendees. 'We need lawyers, we need trained lawyers, to determine whether or not these [illegal immigrant] kids meet the criteria for refugee status.'

Biden said he understood it's 'going to be really hard' to pick and choose which children deserve to stay, but it must be done.

'I wish I had a more perfect solution,' he told them, noting that even comprehensive immigration reform wouldn't solve this problem.

The Obama administration has promised to speed up deportation hearings and administration officials have expressed interest in changing the law to allow Central American children - who make up the bulk of new arrivals - to voluntarily return home, as most will not qualify for refugee status under current law.

But immigration advocates and many 
Democrats have come out in staunch opposition to the initiatives because 
they reduce immigrant children's access to the court system.

In July the American Civil Liberties Union, American Immigration Council, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Public Counsel, and K&L Gates LLP filed a class-action lawsuit against the government for not providing illegal children with legal representation.

'If we believe in due process for children in our country, then we 
cannot abandon them when they face deportation in our immigration 
courts,' Ahilan Arulanantham, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's 
Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.

'The government pays for a trained prosecutor to advocate for the 
deportation of every child. It is patently unfair to force children to 
defend themselves alone.'

In an emergency funding request to Congress in July the White House requested $15 million for legal representation for children in immigration proceedings.

Democrats in the Senate revised the White House's request upward to $50 million, but that bill died in the Senate just before it left for August recess. A Republican bill approving additional border spending cut funding for lawyers for immigrant children out in its entirety.

That bill passed the House late last Friday and awaits action in the Senate when members return next month. President Barack Obama has said he would veto that bill because it did not adequately fulfill immigration agencies needs.

Just as the flare up on the border the White House announced $2 million in grants for a federally funded public defender program for illegal immigrant children that will be managed by the Department of Justice and the Corporation for National and Community Service, the agency that oversees AmeriCorp.

The program will provide for 100 lawyers and paralegals for children under the age of 16 who are have already received a notice to appear before the court.

A  spokesperson for the Corporation for National and Community Service told the New York Times in June that 'the program has been in the works for a really long time' and while consistent with the administration's goal to provide representation to newly arriving illegal immigrant children, it was part of its response to the border crisis.

'A hundred lawyers nationwide is not going to satisfy our commitment to protecting these children,' Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, told the New York Times after the administration announced the program.

'If we have to give lawyers to murderers, then perhaps we should give them to refugee orphans.'

Likewise, Kristen Jackson, a senior staff attorney with non-profit law firm Public Counsel, one of the group's suing the Department of Justice, said there's not enough lawyers who are willing to represent illegal children to for free, however.

'Each
 day, we are contacted by children in desperate need of lawyers to 
advocate for them in their deportation proceedings,' Jackson said in a statement supporting the class action suit. 'Pro bono efforts 
have been valiant, but they will never fully meet the increasing and 
complex needs these children present.'

Only with additional financial aid from the government will illegal immigrant children receive the legal help they need, she argued.

'The time has come for our 
government to recognize our Constitution’s promise of fairness and its 
duty to give these children a real voice in court.'
