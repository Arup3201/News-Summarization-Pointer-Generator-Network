She said: 'We've seen the little lad out on his bike and sometimes we've seen him in his window bouncing on his bed.'

Neighbour Paula Smith, 43, said she was sickened to hear of the death of the boy.

She said: 'I've lived here for eight years and I'm sickened that this has happened so near to Christmas. 

'I feel so sorry for the family that are involved. I used to see the little boy going up and down the street on his scooter being followed by his little sister.

'I don't know the family but I can't believe that this has happened. It's tragic and it's awful.

'He was such a young boy who had got all his life ahead of him.

'He was such a pleasant little boy who always said hello to you even though I didn't know him.'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named said: 'It's really tragic. There are police outside in the street and I don't think anyone knows exactly what happened at this stage.

'He looked like a lovely little boy but I never really spoke to the family. It's usually a very quiet street.'
