A father and daughter were killed and four other members of their family seriously injured when their speedboat ran out of control yesterday.

The group, including a four-year-old boy, were thrown from the boat when it flipped over.

Hundreds of holidaymakers who had been enjoying the Bank Holiday sunshine on the Camel Estuary near Padstow watched in horror as the boat raced round in circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the water 'red with blood'.

Police said the boat will be subject to examination and other lines of enquires are being followed

Witnesses said a man heroically leapt on to the runaway boat from another craft in an attempt to prevent more people being hit.

Last night Devon and Cornwall police 
confirmed that the two who died were a 51-year-old man and his daughter 
aged eight. Detective Sergeant James Colwell said: 'The information is 
suggesting at the moment that they are not local to the area and are 
here on holiday, renting a holiday home. Unfortunately the family 
members that were taken to hospital do have life-changing injuries.'

The survivors were flown to Derriford hospital in Plymouth. They were a 39-year-old woman, a four-year-old boy and two girls aged 10 and 12.

It is believed that the boat, named 
Milly, is a rigid inflatable boat or RIB privately owned by the family. 
Speedboats are common sights around the harbour area in the popular 
tourist destination, nicknamed 'Padstein' because it is home of 
celebrity chef Rick Stein.

Emergency services were scrambled 
after they received a large number of calls from members of the public 
who had been standing on the packed harbourside when they saw the 3.50pm
yesterday afternoon.

Three RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene as well as search and rescue helicopters from RNAS Culdrose and RMB Chievenor.

Witnesses described the efforts of the unidentified man to bring the boat under control and also praised the lifeboatmen.

Maria Chase wrote on Facebook: 'We 
were down in Padstow today and saw the tragedy and saw a hero who saved 
more lives by jumping on to an out-of-control speedboat from another 
boat.

'The water was red, it was terrible. That boat most have hit those poor people at a terrifying speed.'

'He deserves a medal, whoever he was.'

Another, Charlotte Jacobs, wrote to 
the RNLI on Twitter: 'We witnessed incredible bravery in Padstow today 
during the tragic accident that unfolded. The men involved deserve 
medals.'

Other witnesses told of the horror of seeing the runaway boat locked into a circling pattern.

One woman who did not want to be named
said: 'I saw a helicopter come over us and rushed over to see the 
commotion and saw two ambulances on the beach, they were working on two 
people who looked in a lot of trouble.

'The water was red, it was terrible. That boat most have hit those poor people at a terrifying speed.'

Padstow resident Martin Jenkins, 63, 
said: 'I heard the helicopter and went over to the estuary and saw the 
ambulance crews working on a couple of people.

'It was all very frantic. The 
emergency services acted pretty quickly and everyone was ushered away so
we couldn't see any more, it was probably for our own good because it 
looked a mess, it was pretty nasty.

'It looked terrible, the water was filled with blood like a horror film.'

Saskia Wilce who works on the 
harbourside wrote on Twitter: 'So horrible seeing the injured people 
today. The motor thing went funny and flipped the boat so everyone flew 
out and it started circling them all then went through them.'

Natalie Dawe added that she believed the boat had come from nearby Rock.

Jo Rawlings of the Maritime and 
Coastguard agency said: 'Falmouth Coastguard was first contacted at 
15.48 this afternoon reporting that six people had been thrown from a 
speedboat approximately half a mile off Padstow in the Camel Estuary.

'It was reported by members of the public that the boat was out of control and had struck a number of those in the water.

'The RNLI lifeboats from Rock and 
Padstow along with the search and rescue helicopters from RNAS Culdrose 
and RMB Chivenor were sent to the scene. St Merryn, Newquay and Polzeath
Coastguard Rescue Teams have also been involved.

'It is a popular destination and, with the weather being quite pleasant, it was fairly busy.'

Last night the normally bustling harbour was cordoned off by police.

A spokesman for official tourist body 
Visit Cornwall said: 'Our thoughts are with the injured and bereaved 
involved in the tragic speed boat accident at Padstow harbour this 
afternoon.'

Rick Stein and his wife Jill wrote on 
their Facebook page: 'Our thoughts are with injured and bereaved 
involved in the tragic accident in Padstow this afternoon.'
