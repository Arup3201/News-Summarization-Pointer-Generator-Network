A Texas breast cancer doctor has been convicted of aggravated assault after she poisoned her lover by lacing his coffee with a chemical found in antifreeze.

A Houston jury found Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo guilty of spiking her physician boyfriend Dr George Blumenschein's drink with ethylene glycol. 

Prosecutors told the court that she was a devious and diabolical person who became obsessed with her colleague following an affair that turned into a 'fatal attraction'.

The 43-year-old researcher who worked at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center could face life in prison with the punishment stage of the trial beginning as soon as the verdict was read out.

Jurors heard that the relationship between the pair had deteriorated after Blumenschein spurned her in favor of his 10-year live in girlfriend Evette Toney.

They  were involved in a casual sexual relationship, but maintained to some that it was strictly professional. 

Witnesses testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the hospital where she and Blumenschein worked.

Dr Blumenschein admitted himself to the hospital on January 27, 2013 complaining that he did not feel right, and doctors soon discovered he was suffering kidney failure.

Earlier that day he drank two cups of coffee prepared for him by Dr Gonzalez-Angulo, which authorities now believe may have been laced with ethylene glycol, a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze.

He is now six to eight times more likely to die a premature death.

Dr Gonzalez-Angulo was picked up and charged with aggravated assault five months later.

She was apparently upset that Dr. Blumenshein and Dr Toney were back together and trying to have a baby.

She gave an emotional testimony after she revealed to the court that she still loved her long-term partner, despite discovering that he was having an affair. She said he had always denied it

Blumenschein survived the poisoning but told jurors he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function. 

Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys argued that other people, including Toney, might have been responsible for the poisoning, an allegation that Toney has denied. 

However, during testimonies earlier this week, Toney told jurors that she did not poison Blumenschein and that despite the affair she still loves him.

She said they are still together and are working on their relationship. 'It's a work in progress,' she said.

Toney testified that shortly after Blumenschein was hospitalized following his poisoning, he told her that he believed Gonzalez-Angulo had poisoned him.

But Toney said he told her to not tell anybody of his suspicions because he feared Gonzalez-Angulo might hurt him again or hurt her.

'At one point, George said, 'Evette, do not poke the dragon,' Toney said.

Toney testified she helped Blumenschein record telephone conversations he had with Gonzalez-Angulo as part of efforts to try and gather evidence against her.

Gonzalez-Angulo did not make a confession on the phone calls, but prosecutors have said they show the obsessive feelings she had toward Blumenschein.

While Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys questioned Toney, they suggested that Toney had been upset Blumenschein would not marry her.
