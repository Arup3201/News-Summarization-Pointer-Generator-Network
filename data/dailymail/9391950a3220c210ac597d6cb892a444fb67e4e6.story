President Obama surprised tourists in Washington on Wednesday when he took an impromptu stroll along the National Mall, jacket casually slung over his shoulder.

The President chose an ‘on the ground’ approach as he made his way to the Interior Department to sign a proclamation designating a national monument in New Mexico.

After making some remarks, he retraced his path back to the White House and greeted tourists from all over the globe, including China and Germany.

‘The bear is loose,’ the president 
said to a press pool accompanying him on a muggy, spring afternoon as he
 walked through a grassy area on the mall known as the Ellipse. ‘It's 
good to be out.’

‘We can shake hands. I won't bite,’ Obama said as he ushered them over, despite being flanked by burly Secret Service agents.

One
 lady squealed with delight after shaking hands and taking pictures with
 the president. He wished another onlooker happy birthday.

Obama's
 busy day included meeting with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki
 in the morning amid an investigation of veterans hospitals across the 
country, and honoring the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks at a 
White House ceremony in the afternoon.

In the past, Obama has walked through Lafayette Square adjacent to the White House to attend church services with his family.

During
 the partial government shutdown in October, he walked to a sandwich 
shop on Pennsylvania Avenue that was offering discounts to furloughed 
federal employees.

But typically the president rides in a heavily guarded motorcade to wherever he's going.

White
 House officials have been holding private meetings this week aimed at 
soothing lawmakers' concerns over the U.S. posture in Syria, the future 
of the American military presence in Afghanistan and defense spending.

The meetings come as a frustrated White House seeks to push back at criticism of President Barack Obama's foreign policy.

But the White House outreach appeared to be having little effect on some lawmakers' concerns.
