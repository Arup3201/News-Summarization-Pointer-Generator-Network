An 18-year-old who was about to leave for basic training in the Army is now awake after being critically injured in a hit-and-run car accident in Holiday, Florida.

The Florida Highway Patrol is asking for the public's help in finding the driver of a gray or silver van with obvious front-end passenger side damage who smashed into Michael Eberl early on Thursday morning while he was walking to a friend's house. 

Investigators say Eberl flew almost 100 feet through the air before landing in a ditch, according to Fox 13.

Michael Eberl's family said his dream has long been to become an officer in the U.S. Army. He was supposed  to leave for basic training today following a goodbye party on Saturday when the car accident threatened to derail his dream

Eberl suffered multiple skull fractures and cranial bleeding from the hit-and-run accident. He's now awake but continues to breath from a tube. His family is concerned his brain may be damaged

A woman found Eberl about 40 minutes later, called 911 and stayed with him until paramedics arrived. 

Eberl, who graduated from high school earlier this year, was supposed to leave for basic training in the Army on Sunday. His going away party had been scheduled for the previous day.

Veronica Scott, the teenager's mother, feared the incident could ruin his life. 

'It kills me,' she said. 'He was supposed to leave for basic training.'

Eberl, who is originally from Duluth, Minnesota, according to his Facebook page, is recovering after suffering multiple skull fractures and cranial bleeding at Bayonet Point Regional Medical Center in nearby Hudson. He is still connected to a breathing tube. 

Eberl, third from left, was a member of his high school's JROTC and competed in raider competitions, in which cadets compete against students from other schools and learn military survival skills

His first words when he finally awoke were 'where's my cell phone? I have to call my friends and let them know I am OK,' Scott told WTSP. 

Eberl's dream has long been to become a career officer in the Army, family and friends told the Florida TV station.

'I definitely want to see him in his uniform 'cause that's what he loves,' his mother said, adding that he remains strong. 

'When he would start to wake up a little bit, he would give us the thumbs up. And that's Michael,' she said.

Eberl didn't break any bones, but his family is worried about how the accident will affect his brain, Fox 13 reported. 

'He has several skull fractures. A ventilator is helping him breathe,' his uncle Noah Ruhanen said. 'He is a healthy 18-year-old, which is definitely on his side.'

Eberl likes hip hop music, the book 'Marley and Me', the Minnesota Vikings and chocolate chip cookies, according to his Facebook profile.

He was also a JROTC cadet at his high school and competed in raider competitions, in which students gain some basic military training and learn survival skills.

Tyler Ruhanen is demanding justice for the person who left his brother for dead.

'It's just hard every time you walk in there knowing it's your brother laying in that bed and not someone else,' said Ruhanen, who asked the driver of the vehicle to 'just turn yourself in'. 

According to his Facebook profile, Eberl likes hip hop music, the book 'Marley and Me', the Minnesota Vikings and chocolate chip cookies.
