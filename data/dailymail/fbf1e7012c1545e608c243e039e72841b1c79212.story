Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will target a central defender, a holding midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer with a £50million transfer war chest.

Per Mertesacker could pay for some poor performances this season, with Dortmund centre half Neven Subotic and Aleksandar Dragovic of Dynamo Kiev on the Gunners’ radar.

Arsenal goalkeepers David Ospina and Wojciech Szczesny will also be sweating on their futures. Petr Cech is a possible target, although Chelsea may not be prepared to sell to a rival.

Wenger is a long-term admirer of Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin, who is the leading contender for the midfield holding role.

Gabriel and Laurent Koscielny's place in Arsene Wenger's plans for next season look secure.

But the arrival of a new centre back in the summer is likely to have repercussions for Mertesacker.

The German's performances have been criticised this season, though he was excellent in Monday's euphoric FA Cup win over Manchester United.

He was recently dropped by Wenger, but Gabriel's hamstring injury has seen the defender handed an instant route back into the first-team.

And the arrival of a new centre-half could marginalise Mertesacker's role in Wenger's plans.

The capture of a new central defender could also have consequences for Calum Chambers.

The England international has been used as cover at centre-back this season, but the club's transfer plans could mean Wenger sees his long-term future at right-back or holding midfield.
