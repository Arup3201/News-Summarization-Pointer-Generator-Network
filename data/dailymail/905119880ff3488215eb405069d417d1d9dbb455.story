England backed their two big bowlers to come good in the third Test, and Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad stood up to be counted on a third day at the Ageas Bowl that was almost as satisfying for their captain as the opening two.

It is their senior players who England hoped would carry them through this transitional summer. They let the side down at Lord’s but on Tuesday Anderson and Broad joined Alastair Cook and Ian Bell in leading the way.

Wickets were never going to come easily on an easy-paced pitch under a fierce Hampshire sun but England whittled away to leave India 323 for eight, still 246 behind, with two days to try to force a  priceless victory.

England vowed to freshen up their pace
 attack in the aftermath of their second Test defeat and it soon became 
clear that both Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes would be introduced to 
this Investec series in Southampton.

The
 question was who would miss out and up until the eve of this match it 
seemed Broad would be rested here after one of his worst Tests in years 
and with his right knee needing an operation sooner rather than later.

Thankfully
 for England, such thoughts were resisted, probably because Broad 
insisted he was fit for action, and this most competitive of cricketers 
was back to his best, at least until the demands of the day appeared to 
catch up with him late on.

Broad
 said at the close: ‘Peter Moores told the senior players to go out and 
play like it was our  first Test. Cooky and Belly were fantastic with 
the bat and now Jimmy and I have contributed with the ball. Hopefully 
the wicket will deteriorate now.’

There
 was never any danger of Anderson missing out here, not least because he
 could be suspended for the last two Tests, and he was the pick of the 
attack as India struggled to climb the mountain that England’s 569 for 
seven represented.

It could 
be argued that England were too quick to ring the changes, even though 
they were at close to rock bottom after Lord’s, and certainly it is 
questionable whether leaving out Liam Plunkett and Ben Stokes has 
improved their attack.

The 
dropped pair took nine of the 20 India wickets to fall at Lord’s, even 
though Plunkett was poor in the first innings and Stokes’s problem was 
more with his batting than his bowling, while Jordan and Woakes 
went wicketless.

Jordan was 
dropped after two Tests earlier this summer because he failed to take a 
wicket against Sri Lanka at Headingley and there was a clamour to bring 
back Stokes but the chopping and changing has not helped him settle.

He
 was said to have returned to his red-ball best for Sussex against 
Warwickshire at Horsham last week but here he struggled for rhythm and 
accuracy and left Cook a bowler down on another flat pitch.

Woakes
 has been a constant presence in England squads without being given many
 opportunities and while he has bulked up and added a yard of pace, this
 was far from a convincing case for permanent inclusion.

These
 were hardly inviting conditions for seam, with little of the pace and 
bounce promised by Hampshire, but Woakes  was only able to provide a  
containing job.

Even though 
Cook would have been wary of over-bowling his big two, which he has 
tended to do this summer, he again seemed reluctant to give as many 
overs as he should have done to Moeen Ali’s developing off-spin.

What
 an interesting couple of days Moeen has had. A point to be made about 
his wrist-band ‘protest’. This may not have been the best place to make a
 political statement but we often criticise sportsmen for being vacuous 
and unaware of the world around them. At least here we have an 
intelligent, principled man, and a proud Briton and Muslim, who wanted 
to make a point about a humanitarian issue.

He should not be criticised for that, nor slapped on the wrist by the ineffectual International Cricket Council.

As
 a spinner, Moeen is not and probably never will be in Graeme Swann’s 
league but he is taking wickets and added a couple more here when his 
captain eventually turned to him, admittedly to awful shots from Rohit 
Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane.Moeen should have had Rahane much earlier when
 he was caught down the legside by Jos Buttler, who had an excellent 
first full day behind the stumps, but Rod Tucker made his latest 
umpiring mistake.

Eventually
 Moeen had Rahane caught by substitute Sean Terry, son of one of 
Hampshire’s greatest fielders in Paul Terry, standing in for the injured
 Bell.

If Moeen’s wickets 
had an element of fortune, there was nothing lucky about the six taken 
by Anderson and Broad, who utilised what little orthodox and reverse 
swing there was in the Hampshire air.

Tail-end
 resistance has been England’s curse in recent times and they will again
 be frustrated that they allowed India to recover from 217 for six to 
their eventual 323 for eight, which gives them hope of avoiding the 
follow-on figure.

MS Dhoni 
never looks as if he has the technique to survive in England but he was 
there at the close, unbeaten on 50, while Ravindra Jadeja again launched
 a punishing counter-attack that this time was nipped in the bud by 
Anderson.

How Anderson, with
 his immediate future to be decided on Friday following his spat with 
Jadeja at Trent Bridge, must have enjoyed that one.

If
 England can take the last two wickets quickly on Wednesday, Cook will probably
 bat again and try to leave his side a day and an hour to bowl India 
out, but whichever way he goes about it, England are in with a real 
shout here of levelling the series with two Tests to play.
