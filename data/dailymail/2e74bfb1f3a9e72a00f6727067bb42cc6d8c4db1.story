If remembering your four digit PIN is confusing, things are about to get a lot worse.

Researchers have unveiled a new, safer system using colours and symbols as well as numbers.

They say it could cut ATM fraud dramatically.

The keypad of the future? The colours and symbols  move around each time the pad is used, and are displayed on its screen

A user chooses a PIN with a combination of numbers, colours and shapes/symbols: for example - 3, square, pink, flag.

Each
 time that the user has to input their pin, the colours and symbols 
randomly change position on the keypad, so you’re never pressing
 the same sequence of keys.

Called Tri-Pin, the idea came to inventor Glynn Reynolds after a friend was a victim of ATM fraud.

'Tri-pin is a very simple, but effective idea with a higher level of security than traditional PINs,' he said.

The system would avoid many current practices used by fraudster to steal PIN numbers, such as 'shoulder surfing' to see which keys are being pressed.

Because different keys would be pressed every time a withdrawl was made, it would be impossible to find a PIN without seeing the screen and keypad clearly.

'It looks like much like any other 10 digit
 keypad, but instead of each button having just a number, they also have
 a colour and a symbol/shape,' the firm says.

 the same sequence of keys.

It could also be used to unlock smartphones, tablets and even doors, the firm says.

'The great thing about TRI-PIN is that it's a software solution, so if it was available on Apple/Android, all you need to do is update current devices rather than upgrade or change them,' said Reynolds.

The first company to use TRI-PIN is Lunabee on there oneSafe app on iPhone, iPad and Mac.

The system could be used on existing ATM machines by updating their software
