Given the current climate you’d think a BBC DJ would want to keep his head down.

Not so Radio 1’s Nick Grimshaw, the station’s latest breakfast show presenter.

Grimshaw, 28, has been in the job for barely a few weeks but he has already caused outrage with a series of foul-mouthed comments on his Twitter account. As a result, parents have set up an online petition claiming he is a poor role model for younger fans.

In one recent tweet to his 680,000 followers, the presenter wrote: ‘Guess what I want for Breakfast? A TOTAL MINDF***.’ The Facebook group – Get Grimmy off the Radio by Xmas – now has more than 700 members.

Campaigner Richard Sherwood, 28, who has been a Radio 1 listener all his life said: ‘This particular comment was brought to my attention by a friend’s 13-year-old daughter who was until recently a fan of Nick Grimshaw.

‘Like a lot of youngsters she wants to know everything she can about the celebs she follows. She stumbled across this comment on Twitter and was very shocked. She showed it to her father who passed it to me.’

Mr Sherwood, a male nurse, added: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model for kids but using this sort of language is surely inappropriate’.

In other tweets, Grimshaw – known to his fans as Grimmers – makes an unsavoury reference to Lily Allen and Lewis Hamilton.

Outrage: Parents are disgusted at the Radio 1 DJ's comments

The row came as the radio presenter joined the BBC’s biggest stars to broadcast to millions for Children in Need.

Father-of-one Ben Baker, who helped set up the Facebook group, said: ‘As a dad I’ve got to say I’m pretty concerned he’s saying this sort of thing on Twitter and that kids can very easily read it.’

Mr Baker, 34, a club DJ, continued: ‘We have nothing against Nick Grimshaw personally but don’t think he’s right for this show. The BBC have got a lot wrong here – they’re alienating listeners and upsetting parents who pay the licence fee.’ The changeover demonstrates how obsessed with young audiences the BBC are, he added.

‘A lot of people in our group have listened to Radio 1 for years. They’re in their 20s but now feel they are no longer welcome at the station as listeners. They’re too young to go to Radio 2 so where do they go?’

In an emailed response to Mr Sherwood, Radio 1 content manager Chris Humphrys said: ‘Radio 1 has a very clear social media policy to distinguish between “official” BBC accounts on services like Facebook and Twitter – which we ensure meet our expected editorial standards – and individuals’ private pages.

As such, we do not regulate Nick’s personal comments, but we will certainly pass your concerns on to him and remind him of the need to be aware that he is likely to be attracting new, sometimes younger, followers.’

As they are in a personal capacity, Grimshaw’s tweets are apparently not covered by new regulations to stop staff making online comments about the broadcaster’s current problems.

Grimshaw took over from Chris Moyles as the breakfast host in September and has had a rocky transition. He has been pictured out boozing with celebrity friends such as One Direction star Harry Styles and socialite Pixie Geldof, just hours before the early morning radio show.

And earlier this month he caused uproar when he declared that Robbie Williams was too old for Radio 1.

In an interview with 5 News, he said the pop star was ‘irrelevant’ to his listeners. Williams has topped the charts with both his latest single, Candy and his album Take the Crown.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Nick has proved incredibly popular since taking over the Breakfast Show and we have received lots of positive feedback among our target audience. There has been one comment regarding language on Nick’s personal Twitter feed which has been raised with him.’
