A 'despicable' burglar posed as a police officer to trick his way into the house of a man dying of cancer before stealing presents bought for a family friend.

Robert Kolwicz, 63, had just returned home from the Bristol Royal Infirmary when Ross Madden knocked on his door and said he needed to search the flat.

Madden, 21, claimed to be a police officer investigating money laundering. He proceeded to look around both bedrooms before saying he couldn't find anything.

An hour after his visitor had gone, Mr Kolwicz, a retired lorry driver, realised a laptop and an iPod had been stolen from his spare room.

The items were Christmas gifts that the grandfather of three ad been planning to give to a close family friend who often visited him.

After the raid on December 14, his health and state of mind deteriorated and he had to spend what is likely to be his last Christmas Day - also his birthday - back in the Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Mr Kolwicz's son Nathan said: 'A crime is a crime, but for someone to do something like this - I wouldn't wish it on anybody. To target a vulnerable pensioner with cancer is terrible.

'Dad had not long come home from hospital when it happened. The burglary really knocked him back.

'He lasted about ten days before he was back at the BRI and after that he didn't want to go back home. He's now in a care home.'

The 31-year-old, from Chipping Sodbury, Glocs, said: 'The burglary made him a nervous wreck and he was ringing me at three or four in the morning, worried.'

Jailed: Madden, who was known to police, was sentenced to two years and 146 days at Bristol Crown Court

Mr Kolwicz could not afford to replace the Christmas presents stolen by Madden, of Bristol.

Madden was identified from a fingerprint that scenes of crimes experts recovered from Mr Kolwicz's front door.

The confidence trickster, who was known to the police and had previous convictions for raiding homes, was arrested on December 19 and charged with burglary.

In police interview, Madden claimed he had been with a friend who had apparently wanted to go to his grandfather's flat.

He claimed it was his friend who searched Mr Kolwicz's rooms before handing him a bag containing a computer.

However, by the time the case came to Bristol Crown Court, with no evidence that anyone else had been with Madden that day, he admitted the charge and was sentenced to two years and 146 days in prison by Judge Julian Lambert.

DC Kai Hannan, of Avon and Somerset police's Doorstep Crime Team, said: 'This really was a despicable crime. Ross Madden targeted and preyed on an elderly and vulnerable man.

'The notion that someone would not know that Mr Kolwicz was ill, given his current condition, is simply not true.'
