Courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth is only the tenth British soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Second World War

Their pride mingled with sorrow, the family of the Grenadier Guardsman awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in Afghanistan learned yesterday the full extent of his heroism.

Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, died as he led his team in storming a Taliban stronghold. He was gunned down as he attempted to throw his final grenade at a sniper.

His mother Kerry, father Duane - himself a former Grenadier - and brother Coran, 22, a serving soldier, were at the regiment's barracks in Aldershot to hear the VC citation read by Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw, the Commander Land Forces.

He said L/Cpl Ashworth had shown 'immense courage, which represents the very best of his generation'.

The Grenadier Guard fell as he selflessly disregarded
ferocious enemy fire from just a few metres in a bid to hurl a grenade at an
insurgent sharpshooter.

It has been reported that the 6'8" soldier killed three
Taliban fighters during the close-quarters assault in Helmand.

His bravery persuaded senior officers to recommend the
soldier - known by his friends as a 'gentle giant' - for the VC.

The award stated: 'Despite the ferocity of the insurgent's
resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten.

'His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the
last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who
had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier
in the attack.

'This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the
highest recognition.'

Mrs Ashworth, 44, from Corby, Northamptonshire, said the family was 'ecstatically happy' his heroism is being honoured.

'If anyone was in 
trouble he would go and help them. He was like that from a young age,' 
she said. 'this award doesn't make it easier but it does make it feel 
that it wasn't for nothing.'

'We never in our wildest dreams expected this,' she said.

'I
 miss his smile. He’s got the best smile anyone could ever have. He 
always smiles... and his hugs. I just love him so much,' she said.

'We
 just miss him so much, but this award is not just for James it’s for 
everybody who fights and who has been injured and the whole town is so 
proud of him,' she said.

'I didn't know the full extent [of what he had done]. I knew
a bit about what happened and I know when we came to meet the soldiers they
were saying how wonderful he was, but I never in my life expected this.

Mr Ashworth, 44, a holiday complex manager, added: 'We knew
what he had done was exceptional. That is the sort of thing you know he would
do.'

The VC has been awarded just ten times to UK soldiers since
the Second World War.

The posthumous honour to L/Cpl Ashworth, of the 1st
Battalion the Grenadier Guards, is just the second from the 12-year conflict in
Afghanistan.

The Army said that the soldier, from Corby,
Northamptonshire, was leading a 25-man reconnaissance patrol on a mission to a
Taliban-occupied village.

But the unit came under fire from insurgents with rifles and
an enemy sharpshooter.

L/Cpl Ashworth immediately took the decision to lead his
team in a 300metre charge to the enemy mud compound in a local village in
Nahr-e Seraj district, the scene of fierce fighting.

Hero: James Ashwoth was just the tenth person since the Second World War to be awarded a VC

Two insurgents were killed in the initial attack but a
follow-up assault stalled when an Afghan policeman was killed as the enemy
fled.

An Army spokesman said: 'With no regard for his own safety,
L/Cpl Ashworth again led from the front of his team, advancing on an insurgent
compound and using grenades to drive the final remaining enemy to an
outbuilding.

'The insurgent was now being supported by fire from several
positions, with the enemy desperate to protect their sharpshooter team.

'The immediate priority for L/Cpl Ashworth's team was now to
neutralise the final sharpshooter and extract as soon as possible.

'Seeking to break the stalemate using his final grenade,
L/Cpl Ashworth dropped to the floor and crawled behind a knee-high wall that
ran parallel to the front of the outbuilding.

'With just enough cover to conceal his prostrate form, he
inched forward on his belly.

'Bullets flew over his head as he edged forward and the
enemy continued to engage the rest of his team.

'When he was within five metres of the insurgent's position
L/Cpl Ashworth was desperate to make his last grenade count.

'He deliberately crawled out from behind the wall, exposing
himself to fire to get a better angle for his throw.

'L/Cpl Ashworth was now in full view of the enemy just
metres away, with rounds hitting the floor just centimetres around him.

'He was preparing to throw the grenade when he was
tragically hit by enemy fire.'

After hearing the citation read, Mrs Ashworth said: 'We just miss him so much, but this award is not just for
James it's for everybody who fights and who has been injured and the whole town
is so proud of him.'

She added: 'I talk to him on Facebook and I have children
and grandchildren and that does help, but some days it's really hard and I go
and visit him at his grave - you cope as best you can.'

Valour: Colleagues said Lance Corporal James Ashworth showed extraordinary courage to protect his comrades during the firefight in Afghanistan (file photo)

Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw, Commander Land
Forces, said L/Cpl Ashworth had shown 'immense courage, which represents the
very best of his generation'.

He added: 'James' loss is deeply felt by all in his regiment
and all in the British Army.

'No award can possibly fill the hole left by the loss of a
son, brother and comrade.

'The whole of the Grenadier Guards are justified in feeling
enormous pride that this award has been announced.'

Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War

The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross.

Instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.'

It is hand-made from bronze cannon captured from the Russians at 
the siege of Sevastopol in 1854-55 during the Crimean War.

The bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first medals were awarded.

The Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy.

The medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for acts of "inspirational leadership and the greatest valour" in southern Afghanistan in 2006.

Only 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army.

L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous.

Private Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered serious head injuries.

The Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942).

The George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate.

These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.
