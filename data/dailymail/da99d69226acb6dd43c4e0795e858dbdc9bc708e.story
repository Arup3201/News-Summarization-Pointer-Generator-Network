Don't look down: Germany teenager Andrej Ciesielski climbed the Manulife Plaza in Hong Kong with a camera strapped to his head

Andrej said while he went to extreme lengths to get the footage, he was more scared of being caught by police than falling. 

He said: 'The tricky thing about this building is that it's a commercial office so it's well secured. At the top there is a big spire that is absolutely amazing.

'I had to climb this one alone because my friend who was on the trip with me was afraid he would get caught and arrested.

Daredevil: The 18-year-old completed the climb to the top of the 700ft building without any safety equipment, and wearing 'good shoes with good grip'

Fearless: The teenager from Munich looks over Hong Kong from the top of the Manulife Plaza. He said climbing makes him feel 'so free'

'When I'm 'roof-topping' it's not the height I'm thinking about, it's the police. I'm not thinking about falling, I'm just thinking about getting caught.

'After this particular climb I was paranoid for the entire day that I'd been caught on the security cameras but fortunately I wasn't.

'I didn't use any safety equipment, just some good shoes with a good grip.

'My parents like the end result, they enjoy looking at my pictures but they aren't very happy about what I do. They don't like watching the videos because they're scared I could fall one day.

'When I'm climbing though I just feel so free. It makes me really happy. I know some people will struggle to understand that but for me it's freedom and I do it because I love it.'

The teenager chronicles his adventures and escapades on Instagram @andrejcie, where he shares pictures from the top of other skyscrapers and buildings he has scaled.

He revealed that he had been 'blacklisted' for Hong Kong after he was caught on the roof of a hotel.

Andrej wrote: 'Unfortunately I’m on the blacklist in Hong Kong now! 

'We were caught at the second day on the Hotel Panorama roof. 

'But on the last day I managed to climb the Manulife Plaza. #NoRiskNoFun'
