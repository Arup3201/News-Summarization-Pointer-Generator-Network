A Minneapolis-St. Paul airport worker is charged with stealing more than $84,000 worth of shotguns, revolvers, and other weapons and items from passengers' luggage.

David Vang, 23, faces 11 felony counts, including 10 counts of theft of a firearm after video surveillance linked him to the theft of more than 700 items stolen from passengers with connecting flights.

Authorities say Vang of St. Paul scoured through the checked luggage behind closed doors, taking whatever valuables he could find including a crossbow, jewelry, iPads, laptops, cell phones and other electronics.

Footage captured Vang then taking the items to an unsecured employee parking ramp where his wife, Vue Xiong, 21, was waiting in a vehicle, the criminal complaint said.

His wife was charged with one count of felony theft.

A search of his apartment found several boxes containing 716 items in all, the complaint said.

Pat Hogan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said Monday that Vang was employed by a Texas firm to maintain the belt on which checked baggage traveled.

Hogan said authorities learned in September that weapons were being stolen, so they set up surveillance cameras.

Vang was arrested in October and is no longer working at the airport, Hogan said.

According to the complaint, Vang initially claimed the weapons and other items fell out of luggage as it came down the line, but later admitted to stealing, saying he had been doing it since last summer.

'When asked why he did it, Defendant Vang stated that he just wanted the items,' the complaint said.

Hogan said authorities realized there was an issue when they started getting reports that weapons were disappearing during passengers' connecting flights.

Firearms must be packed in separate cases and scanned as a separate piece of luggage, so authorities can determine when a case containing a weapon is removed from one airplane and placed on another.

'In this case, only connecting bags were being pilfered,' Hogan said. 'Weapons were scanned as coming into (Minneapolis-St. Paul) but not scanned as going into the aircraft, so that's what alerted us that there was an issue here.'

Hogan said thefts from luggage are rare, but the airport recommends travelers place valuables such as jewelry in their carry-on luggage. Weapons, however, must be checked.

'Fortunately, we don't deal with this kind of situation very often,' Hogan said. 'Once we found out about it, we were able to track him down and bring him to justice.'

Online court records do not list an attorney for Vang. A working home phone number for Vang was not available on Monday. He will be making his first court appearance April 25 in Hennepin County.Â
