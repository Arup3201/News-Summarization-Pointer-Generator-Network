Police and park rangers are looking for a 12-year-old boy taken by a crocodile while he was swimming with his friends in northern Australia.

Officers said the boy was swimming with other youngsters in the Mudginberri billabong in Kakadu National Park when the crocodile moved in on them.

Another boy, also aged 12, was bitten on the arm and had to receive treatment at a medical centre in his remote community, but the second boy disappeared.

Taken: Police privately believe there is little chance that the boy will be found alive after he was dragged away by a crocodile

His friends said they believed the 
crocodile had grabbed him. Police and park rangers later put out in boats
 for look for the missing boy.

Saltwater
 crocodiles - referred to locally as 'salties' - are in abundance in the
 national park, where filming for the original Crocodile Dundee movie 
was made.

Early today Deputy Police Superintendent Sachin Sharma told the Northern Territory News that police and park rangers were on their way to the location, some 140 miles east of Darwin.

A billabong - an Aboriginal word - describes a calm, isolated stretch of water left behind when a river changes its course.

'I can confirm there has been a report (of a young boy being taken by a crocodile),' he said.

'Police have just arrived, but it's outside the communication zone.'

The unnamed boy is believed to have been taken while swimming in Mudginberri billabong just north of Jabiru in Kakadu National Park

Miss Margot Marshall, a spokeswoman for 
Parks Australia, confirmed that rangers had joined police in the search 
for the missing boy.

The feared tragedy has occurred when the rest of the country was celebrating Australia Day, commemorating the time when the First Fleet, bringing pioneers - and prisoners - arrived on the continent on January 26, 1788.

Signs have been erected near many rivers and pools in the Northern Territory warning people not to enter the water because of the large numbers of crocodiles.

Thirteen people, including six children, have been killed by crocodiles in Australia in the past 12 years.
