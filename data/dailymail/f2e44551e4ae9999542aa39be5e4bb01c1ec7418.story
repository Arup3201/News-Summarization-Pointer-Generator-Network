The Skylon air breathing rocket that could power a plane anywhere in the world in four hours and get to space in 15 minutes has moved a step closer to blasting off as a major project review said it was possible to operate the plane.

A feasibility study carried out earlier this year as part of the European Space Agency's 'New European Launch Service' requirements for lowering the cost of European launch services by 2014 by using a radical new type of engine, have backed the plans - paving the way for it to blast off in 2019.

The engine is called Sabre, which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, and was built by British firm Reaction Engines.

Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' called Skylon (pictured)

 An ESA study found if it were operated from Europe's launch site in French Guiana, together with a reusable upper stage, the project can meet all Europe's launch operator requirements - and be far cheaper than any other option

The European Space Agency report, released earlier this year found:

Skylon is potentially Europe's most cost effective space access solution, and is able to compete with existing and anticipated competition.

Systems reusable design has the potential to undercut any other launch system currently in operation.

Once operational, Skylon could be operated independently of subsidies.

Sklyon could launch payloads of upto 15 tonnes into low earth orbit.

Also offer opportunities for spacecraft return, in-orbit servicing and human passengers.

The €1M ESA-­funded study identified proved that all current mission requirements for launches can be met.

It also said vehicles operated from Europe's launch site in French Guiana, together with a reusable upper stage, can meet all Europe's launch operator requirements.

Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' 
called Skylon.

Now, it is believed the firm is putting the finishing touches to the plan to launch the aircraft - possibly in 2019. 

It has been earmarked as a 'high priority' technology project by the UK government following the favourable technical reports from ESA's propulsion experts. 

'For example, an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from Europe to Australia in about four hours,' said Alan Bond, chief engineer, in a video.

The aircraft will be able to fly Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound - because of the engine, named Sabre, according to Bond. 

Modern-day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they can't 'breathe' oxygen.

Oxygen helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion.

Reaction Engine's Sabre design uses a system of pipes, filled with 
helium.

The air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine.

Once in space, the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode.

This means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites, for example.

Last year the UK Government has announced plans to provide £60 million for a revolutionary new rocket enginecapable of taking people to Earth's 
stratosphere in just 15 minutes.   

David Willetts, minister for 
universities and science, said the investment in Sabre would provide support at a 'crucial stage' to 
allow a full-scale prototype to be built.

'We're investing £60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well,' Willetts told Radio Five Live. 

The Lapcat A2, a passenger plane using the an aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from Europe to Australia in about four hours

The A2 vehicle, which is designed to be propelled by the Scimitar engine, has exceptional range (ca. 20,000 km both subsonic and supersonic) and is therefore able to service a large number of routes whilst simultaneously avoiding supersonic overflight of populated areas and the related sonic booms that can be heard on the ground. Its good subsonic performance enables it to service conventional subsonic overland routes.

'But we're backing this because it's technology that has been tested in the lab, it's been assessed by outside experts as right in principle.

'Now it needs to be built on a full-scale prototype before it can get commercial.

'We think it's right to support it through that crucial stage.

A passenger version, called the Lapcat A2, is also unver development.

Alan Bond, founder of Reaction Engines, told International Business Times: 'Rockets are stuck in a rut. The weight problem means it 
costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite.

'The basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high 
speed it instantly heats up to 1,000C - which is unmanageably hot.

'The challenge was to cool it back down to 140C in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine.'

Bond continued: '[Sabre] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply, to build space
 stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to 
earth. We could even construct spaceships for missions to other 
planets.'

Skylon is likely to be viewed a competitor to Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic business, in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights.

Sir Branson and his Virgin Galactic company offer trips into 
space, that include six minutes of weightlessness, for around £121,000.

Skylon is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper, but has not announced any prices. 

Figures from the company believe the Skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent.

The Sabre engine has taken part in 100 successful test runs and its design was recently validated by the European Space Agency to validate the design.
