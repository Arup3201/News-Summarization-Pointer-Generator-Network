Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 was in trouble and simply heading for the nearest safe airport when it turned off-course, according to a veteran pilot who predicts, in a viral online post, that the wreckage will be discovered somewhere west of the Maldives today.

Chris Goodfellow, a Canadian pilot with 20 years experience, has hailed captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah a hero, not a hijacker, in his fascinating explanation, which claims to debunks all theories about the fate of the missing jet.

He insists the only reasonable scenario is that a fire broke out aboard the plane and Shah was doing exactly what he needed to do in an emergency - get the plane to the nearest airport as soon as possible.

In this case, that was the 13,000 foot strip Palau Langkawi, and that is directly where the aircraft was heading when it was last tracked. However, Goodfellow believes the crew were overcome by smoke and the aircraft flew as a 'ghost plane' for hours past the chosen airport before finally crashing into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives.

'We old pilots were always drilled to always know the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Always,' Goodfellow wrote. 'Instinctively when I saw that left turn with a direct heading I knew he was heading for an airport.'

He said he immediately brought up Google Earth and discovered the runway, which was had fewer obstacles blocking the plane's approach than if Shah attempted to return to Kuala Lumpar, which was also further away.

'This pilot did all the right things. He was confronted by some major event aboard that made him make that immediate turn back to the closest safe airport,' he says in the post.

Goodfellow's initial post went took the web by storm after he posted it on Google Plus and then Reddit.

Simple theory: Chris Goodfellow, a Canadian pilot with 20 years experience, has hailed captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah a hero, not a hijacker, in his interesting post, which took the internet by storm

He wrote a number of follow up posts 
answering the hundreds of questions he had received as more information, and speculation, came to light.

In his last note late on Tuesday, he claimed 
reported sightings of an aircraft over the Maldives corresponds to his 
theory and he predicted it will be found sometime Wednesday a small 
distance west of the Maldives.

In his first post, Goodfellow said the loss of transponders and communications makes 'perfect sense' in the event of a fire.

He suggests an electrical fire may have started inside the plane, perhaps incapacitating crew with smoke. The plane's cargo - which reportedly included a shipment of lithium batteries - may have ignited.

Or possibly one of the tires overheated during takeoff and began burning slowly, eventually making it to the cockpit where the pilots were overcome by smoke.

He said all the circumstances that night - a full plane, hot weather, and a long run takeoff runway - make this incident all the more plausible, and he cited a similar occurrence in Nigeria of a DC8 that had a landing gear fire on takeoff.

He believes at that point, the Malaysian plane 'just continued on (that route)probably on (autopilot) until either fuel exhaustion or fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed.'

'I said four days ago you will find it along that route - looking elsewhere was pointless,' Goodfellow added in his captivating piece.

He said he has been stunned that no officials, pilots or reporters have looked at the case from the pilot's point of view.

'Thanks to Google earth I spotted Langkawi in about 30 seconds, zoomed in and saw how long the runway was and I just instinctively knew this pilot knew this airport. He had probably flown there many times,' the pilot wrote.

As for the last voice transmission, Goodfellow told said 'Good night' is customary as a hand-off to a new air traffic controller and also strongly indicates to him that all was OK on the flight deck.  

Emergency landing: Goodfellow said he knew within 30 seconds of pulling up Google Earth that Shah was heading for an emergency landing at In this case, that was the 13,000 foot strip known as Palau Langkawi, pictured

The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board

He said there are many ways to communicate distress, but at this point he doesn't believe the pilots knew anything was wrong, though things may well have been in the process of unraveling.

He says the plane would have had around 8 hours of fuel, possibly more, and 20-25 per cent would have been burned with takeoff and the climb to cruise.

When the turn was made toward Langkawi, he would have had six hours or more worth of fuel left, which he says 'correlates nicely' with the fact data was still being detected until fuel exhaustion.

'(This) only confirms to me that the crew was incapacitated and the flight continued on deep into the south Indian ocean,' he said.

Whatever caused what he believes was a serious mechanical issue, Goodfellow believes Shah was bravely attempting to save his life and the lives of his crew and passengers.

'Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a hero struggling with an impossible situation trying to get that plane to Langkawi. There is no doubt in my mind,' he said. 'Smart pilot. Just didn't have the time.'
