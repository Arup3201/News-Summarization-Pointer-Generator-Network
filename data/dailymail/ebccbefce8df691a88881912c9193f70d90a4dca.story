Gus Poyet is relieved that fellow South American Sergio Aguero will not be lining up against Sunderland.

The Argentina striker won a standing ovation at the Stadium of Light just four weeks ago when he scored twice in a 4-1 victory.

Aguero, though, lasted just seven minutes of the following game at home to Everton and has not been seen since after suffering knee ligament damage.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is glad that his fellow South American won't be available 

Aguero earned himself a standing ovation after a stunning display at the Black Cats in December 

It means City will again be without a recognised frontman for the visit of the Black Cats and Poyet, given the recent memory of Aguero’s devastating display on Wearside, believes that improves his side’s chances of nicking a result.

‘It's easier to play City without Aguero, no doubt. Let's be honest about that,’ said the Uruguayan.

‘Aguero was different class when we played them at home. We couldn't cope with him.

‘We thought we had him under control, and then he went "boom" from nowhere. He's quality, and in that game he was on fire.’

But Poyet countered: ‘They have quality everywhere though. If you look at how much David Silva has been delivering in recent weeks he's completely changed the way they've been playing. He’s a top player.’

It was at the Etihad last season that Sunderland’s unlikely 2-2 draw provided the platform for a run of four straight wins which saw them escape the relegation zone in the final weeks of the season.

Poyet remains wary of the attacking threat City possess, including the likes of David Silva

And Poyet, whose side trailed inside two minutes but then conceded a late equaliser, reflected: ‘The early goal against Manchester City happened and for some reason the feeling on the pitch changed.

‘Somehow it completely relaxed the players and we started attacking and creating chances. All of a sudden my players thought “hey, we've got a chance here”.

‘The 11 on the pitch felt they should have won it. And where did it come from? I think it was a feeling. They cleared their minds, stopped thinking about this and that and just started playing.

‘At half time we were a goal down but the players believed in themselves. They created that feeling amongst themselves, not me the manager. They changed the game.

‘It was the beginning of the miracle. No doubt. But there were mixed emotions after the game because we should have won.’

Sunderland are 14th in the table but Poyet is frustrated by 11 draws, including six goalless stalemates.

And the head coach, assessing his team at the halfway stage, said: 'We're okay, we could be a bit better. There are too many draws, we're a long way for what I want but we're getting better. I want my team to control the game better, but we're still adapting to what we want.'
