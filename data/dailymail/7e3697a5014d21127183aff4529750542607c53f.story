A schoolboy has become the latest teenager to post a video online detailing the painful experiences he has long endured at the hands of bullies.

Emmanuel Perron is hoping his My Secrets, My Life film will help other bullied children find the strength to cope with their torment.

The 16-year-old from Ottawa placed his moving four-minute short on video sharing website YouTube on Saturday.

Fighting back: Emmanuel Perron has posted his My Secrets, My Life film online to help other bullied children find the strength to cope with their torment

It follows in the footsteps of another anti-bullying video, What's Goin' On, posted by 14-year-old Jonah Mowry. That film has received more than 2.9million views since August.

In a simple set-up, Emmanuel shares his message using a series of handwritten cue cards to inform the viewer of his experiences.

There is no talking during the film; the only noise on the soundtrack is Sarah McLachlan's song Angel.

Emmanuel reveals how he has suffered physical and verbal abuse since kindergarten and that people he thought were his good friends began spreading rumours that he was gay and had raped an ex-girlfriend.

One caption reads: 'Even if my sexual orientation were different from others, everybody should have the same respect.'

Brave: Emmanuel shares his message using a series of handwritten cue cards

Emmanuel, who has been forced to 
change schools twice to escape his persecutors, then goes on to reveal 
how he has self-harmed and considered suicide as a result of the 
relentless harassment.

In the video he thanks two friends and his mother for helping him through the tough times.

His message ends with the words 'We can't lose hope, together we can make it stop', and an appeal to anyone needing help to contact him.

So successful has My Secrets, My Life already proved, that 80 people contacted Emmanuel via email and his Facebook page asking for help in the first 24 hours after his video was posted online.

Using her appeal: Pop star Lady Gaga last week visited the White House and met with Obama administration staff to discuss bullying prevention

Emmanuel told the Ottawa Citizen 
newspaper: 'I tell them to talk about it with a teacher they look up to 
or a principal or doctor.

'Since
I'm only 16, I'm not qualified to give professional advice, so I want 
to send them to someone who can offer more help than I can.'

He added: 'I hope bullies are actually going to see my video and realise what they're doing to people.

'I hope people will have the same courage I had to talk to someone about the bullying and I hope we can all get together and make a difference.'

Emmanuel's mother Lemay and her husband found the video so difficult to watch that they cried for an hour after viewing it for the first time.

She said:Â  'I lived through it with him. It's very difficult as a parent to see your child go through this unfairly.'

Earlier this year, a 14-year-old boy 
who blogged about being suicidal due to incessant bullying at school 
thanked Lady Gaga in his final post before killing himself.

Jamey Rodemeyer, from Buffalo, New 
York, posted a lyric from Lady Gaga's song The Queen on his Facebook 
page which said: 'Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door.'

He then posted a tribute to Lady Gaga, thanking her.

Last week, the singer visited the White House and met Obama administration staff to discuss bullying prevention.

Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett 
praised the star as 'a source of strength for many young people who feel
isolated and scared at their schools'.
