Pennant started his career at Notts 
County before joining Arsenal aged 15 for £2million. He has since played
 for Birmingham, Liverpool, Real Zaragoza and Stoke as well as spending 
tiime on loan at Watford, Leeds and Portsmouth.

The
 former Stoke winger was released by the Potters in January this year 
after being offered a new contract by new manager Mark Hughes.

looking at the exit before Hughes gave him a second chance.

The winger has had a rather chequered career.

He was arrested in 2005 and 2012 for issues related to drink driving.

He famously was the first Premier League player to wear a tag during a match, for Birmingham against Tottenham in 2005.
