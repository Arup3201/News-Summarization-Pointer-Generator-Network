A headmistress has called in police after an animal rights group launched a 'vile' world-wide campaign against her village school where youngsters are rearing three piglets.

Since news of the project emerged, staff say they have been threatened by animal rights campaigners who vowed to demonstrate outside the school and bombarded the headmistress with hundreds of emails.

The 25 pupils at Peasenhall Primary School, near Saxmundham in Suffolk, helped to build a pen and eco-friendly ark for the three Berkshire-Old Spot Gloucester cross piglets, who arrived from a local smallholding a week ago.

But since then the school has been targeted by opponents including an online petition which has already attracted more than 4,600 signatures from around the world, including comments from Chile, Japan, the USA and Israel.

The petition claims that the piglets are to be named Ham, Bacon and Pork, but staff at the school said this was untrue and the animals have deliberately not been named.

Headmistress Kath Cook said today: 'It has been horrendous - we are being bombarded by nasty, vile calls and e-mail messages from all over the world - even America and Australia.

'Some of them are very threatening - things like I should be taken to a slaughterhouse.

'We are getting images of animals being killed or kept in cages - it is horrible.

'We are just trying to shield the children from it all but they have even threatened to demonstrate outside the school. It has become so bad that we have called in the police because this is sheer harassment.'

The trouble began when a local BBC reporter covered the story about the children, aged between five to 11 years old, and their tiny herd of pigs last week .

A spokeswoman for the Colchester Animal Defenders, calling herself Liza Isa-Vegan, said: 'Children should not be exposed to this sort of thing - these pigs will be slaughtered and eaten and no animal should be used as food.

'There is no such thing as healthy 
meat. The children should not be taught that meat is necessary or that 
pigs are lesser beings than humans.

'Not
only are they teaching bad health - one in three 11-year-olds will be 
obese by 2015 - but it is desensitizing children in the process.

'They should not be taught the lesson that we need animals for food because that is a lie.'

Earlier this week, Dr Elizabeth Sidwell, Schools Commissioner for England and Wales, visited the school to give her support to the project, which is part of a campaign to teach children about the origins of food.

The teacher in charge of the project, Sarah Brown said: 'It is important for children to learn the provenance of their food and animal welfare.

'We live in a rural area and the children are surrounded by fields that have animals in them that are being reared for consumption.

'We have had 100 per cent backing from parents - if we hadn't got that we would not be doing it.

'The children are all aware that the pigs are not pets - they have deliberately not been given names - but part of the food chain.

'They understand what is going to happen to them - that they will be sent to a butcher and enter the food chain - it has been thoroughly explained to them.

'All the children are from meat-eating
families - we don't have any vegetarians at the school and all this was
discussed before we started the project.'

Experts
from the Suffolk Smallholder Society will visit the school regularly 
until the pigs are sent for slaughter in the summer.

The
children prepare and weigh out the food for the pigs every day and give
it to the piglets but are not allowed to handle them.

They will also write journals and sketch the pigs as well as draw up marketing strategies - and even devise pork recipes.

A petition against the school rearing the pigs has attracted more than 4,600 signatures from around the world. It claims the piglets are to be named Ham, Bacon and Pork, which the school denies. Teacher Sarah Brown says they have deliberately not been given names

Teachers say the pupils will learn that 'a broad and balanced diet may at times include meat for people are not vegetarians, vegans or follow a religious faith that prohibits the eating of some foods.'

At weekends and during school holidays parents and teachers take over the husbandry.

One villager said today: 'It is appalling that sick-minded strangers are making such horrible threats to the school.

'Mrs Cook and her team do a brilliant job and it shocking that they should be getting so much foul abuse.'

Village butcher Mike Thickitt said: 'It's perfectly natural for children to learn about meat and where it comes from.

'When we were young a lot of people had chickens and pigs in their back garden and as children we always knew they were being kept for meat.'

The school project is run in conjunction with community interest company Cook With Me Kids.

Emma Haines, director of Cook With Me Kids, said:'It's very sad that people are failing to see what we are doing.

'We have organised trips to working farms from the school and the children know what happens to the animals - they know that the pigs will become bacon, sausages and ham.' 

A spokesman for Suffolk police said: 
'We have been made aware of the contact between the protesters and the 
school and the farmer.

'We are in regular liaison with the school and the local community offering reassurance to both where required.

The petition has attracted signatures from around the world, including Japan, the UK and the United States. One signatory said the experience could be traumatic for the children, while another said 'shame on you'. One commenter said children 'who are taught that animals have not (sic) rights will apply the rule to vulnerable humans'

'We have also been in contact with the animal rights demonstrators and continue to monitor the situation.'

The farmer who supplied the pigs said today: 'It’s a great shame that these people are making such a fuss and being so unpleasant.

'No-one is being forced to eat meat and the children are simply learning about where the food they eat comes from.

'They came up to the farm with their teacher shortly after the litter were born to see the piglets that they were going to look after.'

The online petition says: 'The children are being led to believe that it is necessary to kill animals for humans to survive. This is not true.

'Meat isn't necessary for human survival - not only are billions of animals subjected to a horrifying death in a slaughterhouse but livestock farming is destroying the planet and keeping food away from starving people.

'It would be much better for the children to grow vegetables and be taught about animal sentience.

'Pigs like all animals, experience joy, sadness, fear and pain, happiness and misery just the same as humans do - they are more intelligent than dogs and don't deserve to be used and abused for human taste preferences.'
