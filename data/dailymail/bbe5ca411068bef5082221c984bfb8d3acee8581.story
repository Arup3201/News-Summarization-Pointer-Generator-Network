An Israeli government official charged with promoting a positive image of Israel has been gagged after making a series of undiplomatic comments on social networking sites.

Undiplomatic: Daniel Seaman posted a series of critical remarks on Facebook

Among the offensive remarks made by Daniel Seaman, the outgoing deputy director of the now-closed ministry of public diplomacy and dispora affairs, was one that criticised the Church of Scotland and another that asked: 'Is there a diplomatic way of saying "Go **** yourself?'"

The gagging order means Mr Seaman can no longer speak or write on Israel's behalf, although he will retain his new role in the office of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Mr Seaman had written: 'I am sick of 
the Japanese, of the Japanese "Human Rights" and "Peace" groups the 
world over holding their annual self-righteous commemorations for the 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims.

'Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the consequence of Japanese aggression. You reap what you sow...

'Instead, they should be 
commemorating the estimated 50 million Chinese, Korean and other victims
of Japanese imperial aggression and genocide - not to mention nearly 
120,000 Allied military casualties who fought to defeat the genocidal 
Japanese. These are who deserve to be and should be remembered this 
week.'

His remarks came to light after officials from the Japanese Embassy in Tel Aviv spotted the posts and alerted Israeli government officials.

According to reports in Israeli newspaper Haaretz and the Telegraph, Japanese officials contacted Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, to ask whether Mr Seaman's comments were a reflection of Israeli government policy.

The former head of the Israeli 
government press office, Mr Seaman is noted for his confrontational 
relationship with the press and for his robust views.

Others posted by Seaman included a blunt response to the EU's decision to label Lebanon's Hizbollah a terrorist organisation ('half-a****').

And in response to the Church of Scotland's questioning of the notion of a Jewish homeland, he wrote: 'The Church of Scotland? The Calvinist, Presbytarian [sic] Church of Scotland? Why do you think we give a flyin **** what you have to say?'

During Ramadan, Mr Seaman wrote: 'Does the commencement of the fast of the Ramadan mean that Muslims will stop eating each other during the daytime?.'

He also turned his ire on Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, who had commented that Israel had a duty to return to its pre-1967 borders.

'Is there a diplomatic way of saying "Go **** yourself?"' he riposted.

In a statement made to the Telegraph, the Israeli prime minister's office said: "These comments are not acceptable and definitely do not express the positions of the state of Israel."
