Bizarre claims: Igor Girkin said the bodies had been dead for days and reeked of decomposition 

The rebel commander blamed for shooting down flight MH17 has made bizarre claims that bodies at the crash site 'aren't fresh'.

Pro-Russian separatist Igor Girkin has claimed corpses near the debris died days before the plane took off.

According to rebel website Russkaya Vesna, the leader was told by people at the scene in eastern Ukraine that 'a significant number of the bodies were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.'

Girkin, also known as Strelkov and allegedly a former Russian intelligence agent, also suggested that a large amount of blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage.

The information has not been confirmed but the commander said: 'Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness.'

He was said to be among the laughing rebels that filmed the plane as it crashed

Footage is said to have captured him gleefully bragging: ‘That was a blast – look at the smoke!’ while a fireball rose from the debris. 

The extraordinary footage – apparently filmed by the shooters themselves – charts the terrible final moments of the doomed airliner.

A voice believed to be that of Strelkov – dubbed ‘Igor the Terrible’ – announces: ‘The plane was hit!’ He adds: ‘Look at those black spots, these are the parts, flying … it was a blast … look, look, black smoke!' 

As a pall of smoke was seen coming from the crash site, he wrote a triumphant war cry on Twitter, saying: ‘We warned you – do not fly in "our sky”.’ 

The Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 was shot down Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard. 

Shortly after the passenger plane was downed, Strelkov – seen smirking in propaganda photos – tweeted a boastful message claiming responsibility. 

At the time, he apparently believed he had shot down an Antonov-26 military plane of the Ukrainian Air Force, saying it landed near a mine named Progress.

His chilling message read: ‘In the area Torez we just hit down An-26, it’s lying somewhere in the mine 'Progress'.

‘We warned you – do not fly in 'our sky'. And here is the video confirmation of the “bird dropping”.

Boasting militant: The former Russian intelligence officer was said to be among the laughing rebels filmed the plane as it crashed yesterday

‘Bird fell near the mine, the residential sector was not disturbed. Civilians are not injured.’

Later as the horror became clear, the tweet was deleted.

Strelkov, who minutes earlier had been boasting about his ‘military’ success, seems to have gone to ground once he realised his catastrophic mistake. 

A man of mystery with at least three names, Strelkov believed by Ukraine to be a serving Russian colonel in the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the country’s army – a charge firmly denied by Moscow.

He commands pro-Russian forces now in control of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, but his enemies suspect he is a direct agent of the Kremlin.
