Determined: Roads minister Mike Penning has vowed the motorway will reopen on schedule

Fears that the M4 fiasco may continue beyond Thursday were sparked today as the minister responsible insisted that meeting the deadline was only a ‘hope’ and not a certainty.

Concerns rose as Roads Minister Mike Penning  said the key section of the M4 flyover in west London may have cracked as a result of earlier repair work at the site - on a key Olympic route into the capital.

But he backtracked on suggestions by the Government’s own Highways Agency that the Thursday deadline to finish the work and end the chaos would be met, venturing only that this was ‘highly possible’ but also ‘very difficult'.

Transport department officials also sought to put the brakes on suggestions that the repairs would definitely be finished as promised by Thursday, ending five days of chaos affecting more than half a million motorists.

A spokesman said: ’We can’t absolutely guarantee it. The best estimate is that the road will open on Thursday.’

On a visit to the stricken motorway, which is shut for six miles between junctions two and three, Mr Penning said: ‘The crack that caused the shut wasn’t there before.’

He said it was a ‘brand new crack, possibly due to the work we were doing.’

The Boston Manor viaduct was closed between junctions one and three, from Chiswick to Feltham, on Thursday night after the cracks in the steel supports were discovered. A ‘severe’ alert for congestion remains in place.

The closure of the key M4 section 
between junctions 2 and 3 has led to knock-on congestion on other 
gridlocked roads as far as the A3 turn-off into Putney in south-west 
London, where frustrated commuters faced waits of up to an hour.

The M4 route is a major road link from London to the West Country and Wales, as well as a heavily-used commuter route.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was vital the repairs were completed 'as speedily as possible'.

Frustrating: The gridlock is causing road misery for 165,000 drivers every day

Mr Penning said today: ‘Last Thursday
evening they found a crack in one of the areas where they were already 
working that wasn’t there the last time they looked. They checked it 
again and it was growing because the traffic was coming on top.'

He said it would be a ‘catastrophic 
failure’ if the bridge were left broken and engineers wanted to fix it 
‘as soon as possible’.

He said: ‘I'm hoping they will start 
work on that this afternoon, plating it together, and as predicted right
at the start we hope to have it open on Thursday morning.’

Furious commuters stuck in traffic on the M4 have found one way to fill their time - tweeting about it. But is anyone listening? Here's what they are saying:

Pressed again, he refused to give any
guarantees that the road would reopen on Thursday, as the Highways 
Agency predicted today and yesterday.

He said: ‘That’s what we’d like to do, it’s highly possible.’

Derek Turner, the agency’s director 
of delivery and development said the new crack was a two-and-a-half 
inch-deep gash in the welded supports.

He said: 'The crack wasn’t there before and was growing, which caused a hiccup in the repair process.'

The bridge is supported by 10ft-wide 
concrete pillars and underpinned by a lattice of steel girders. Workmen 
are grinding down the cracks and filling them with reinforcement plates.

The Highways Agency said it has inspected 1,000 cracks, of which 64 needed repair and most have been completed.

However, even if the road reopens on 
Thursday, there will be only four days to ensure the flyover is safe 
before the Games lane opens on Monday.

The M4 is expected to be one of the 
busiest routes during the Games because it links the city and Olympic 
Park in Stratford with Heathrow.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director 
of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘After the queues at Heathrow, now there’s 
disruption on the M4. Welcome to Britain.

'The Highways Agency says a crack has
been found at a "sensitive location". Too right it has - on the main 
route in and out of the capital for international visitors.

'This raises big question marks about our ability to look after what we already have, let alone provide new infrastructure.'

The M4 chaos is costing road users 
tens of thousands a day in missed appointments, late deliveries, taxi 
hire and extra fuel, according to the AA.

Around 825,000 drivers will be affected over the five days in which the motorway linking Heathrow and Central London is being shut.

Labour
is now demanding answers from ministers on the impact of cuts to road 
maintenance budgets, which could be the reason for delaying improvement 
works until they became crucial.

The party has also raised questions over the readiness of contingency plans for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

John
Woodcock MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Minister, said: 'It is 
astonishing that with less than twenty days to go before the Olympic 
Opening Ceremony, a key part of the M4 to Heathrow Airport will be shut 
for several days.

'The
Highways Agency has known about issues with the viaduct for at least 
four months, so motorway users will be asking why there has been a 
panicked closure of the road weeks before the Games.

'Ministers
need to confirm that there are contingency plans in place, so that 
another failure of the M4 would not jeopardise the Games. The Tory-led 
Government also needs to urgently review the impact of its £435m cuts to
road maintenance budgets and whether they have contributed to this 
mess.'

Empty: This stretch of the M4 near London from the West is still completely closed for emergency maintenance

Stuck: The Great West Road (A4) is a key diversion route but was at a virtual standstill yesterday

Business leaders spoke of their anger
yesterday after it was revealed that the problems are set to last at 
least five days, despite the fissures between junctions 1 and 3 being 
discovered in March.

The Institute of Directors said the 
closure would be ‘economically damaging’, while the boss of Britain’s 
biggest private hire taxi company called the closure ‘disastrous’ and a 
‘failure of investment in the road network’.

It is the latest road closure on the 
vital route from Heathrow – along which about 80 per cent of traffic to 
the Olympics is expected to travel.

At
Christmas, the A4 – which links to the M4 – was closed after cracks 
were discovered in the Hammersmith flyover. It didn’t fully reopen for 
five months. It would be a PR disaster for London 2012 organisers if the
M4 restrictions were still in place when the Games begin in three 
weeks.

The road has been reopened between junction 1 and 2 to relieve the pressure on Chiswick roundabout.

Congestion
has spread as far afield as the M3, A4, M40, and even A3 in Surrey as 
drivers heeded the Agency's warning to find 'alternative routes' into 
the capital.

Jam: Even an Olympic official's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters

Repairs have begun on the M4 elevated section in west London after cracks were found in the bridge section

Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, was one of the motorists held up in jams caused by the closure.

He
said: ‘It is fortunate that at least this was spotted before any 
accident occurred, but it will still be economically damaging.

‘Closing the M4 so soon after the 
Hammersmith flyover will come as a blow to many. The motorways are major
arteries for the nation’s businesses, transporting people to work and 
goods to customers.

‘This 
infrastructure is crucial to economic success, and having two major road
closures in a few months simply isn’t good enough.’

John
Griffin, boss of Addison Lee, London’s largest private taxi firm, said 
yesterday: ‘This is yet another disaster for the roads network, and 
highlights the lack of investment in key infrastructure.

‘This wholly preventable disaster could not come at a worst time – a few days before the Olympics.’

Mr Watters said the incident showed motorway structures across Britain were ‘showing their age’. 

He said: ‘It’s a close shave, the 
timing is shocking with the Olympics so close. I expect the Highways 
Agency are quite nervous about it. We just hope it is fixed by Thursday,
because it is the most vital artery.’

Blocked: The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2

The new secondary crack causing the current crisis is part of a £4million repair project at the Boston Manor Viaduct.

A Highways Agency spokesman said: ‘We are putting all our efforts into completing the repairs by Thursday.

‘Drivers heading into London are still advised to seek alternative routes via the M3 and M40 and are advised to plan for and leave extra time for their journeys.’

Diversion routes via the A4/A312 were registering delays of 20 minutes in both directions.

The Agency added :’We are aware that congestion has also increased on London's roads. While we do not have access to data for those routes not on our network, we continue to liaise with Transport for London and the relevant local authorities and will make whatever changes are needed to help keep traffic moving in and out of London.

‘We are continuing to monitor the traffic situation and will review our plans if necessary.’
