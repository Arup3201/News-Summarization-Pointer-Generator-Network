Its history is steeped in bloody battle, treachery and intrigue. A thousand years after William the Conqueror built it, Warwick Castle is still at the centre of drama.

There’s not so much gore and murder these days, but feelings are certainly running high amid fears of a new kind of invader laying siege to the castle walls… glampers.

Local burghers are considering whether to approve plans for 20 medieval-style lodges, five tree houses and 41 glamping tents and a banquet area in the castle’s historic grounds.

The grounds of Warwick Castle could soon be home to 20 medieval-style lodges, five tree houses, 41 glamping tents and a banquet area

The inside of the glamping tents - Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle, were granted temporary permission for the tents last year but want 41 permanent ones on the site

At present, families can book one of the tents, some of which come with their own four-poster beds, for between £160 and £200 a night

Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle originally developed by William as a motte and bailey fortress in 1068, were granted temporary permission for glamping tents last year. 

Families can book one of the tents, some of which come with their own four-poster beds, for between £160 and £200 a night.

But now the firm has lodged larger plans with Warwick Council to create a permanent holiday village on the banks of the Avon.

The one and two-story luxury lodges would have a traditional timber frame and thatched roofs and be linked by a network of boardwalks.

The council is expected to rule on the plans – which could see up to 900 tourists stay at the castle each year – at a meeting in November.

If it goes ahead, the holiday village will be built on a 13-acre site 500 yards south of the castle, known as Foxes Study. But furious locals say that the scheme will turn the castle into a ‘Butlins holiday park’.

The castle was built a thousand years ago by William the Conqueror - there are now plans for a holiday village

Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle, are hoping to get permanent permission for glamping 

Chris Edwards, 65, said: ‘This is not Alton Towers. It’s not Legoland. It is England’s premier medieval castle. 

'Granting permission for glamping was the first step in turning this historic heritage site into a theme park. And granting this application would be another nail in the coffin of Warwick as a historic town and of the castle as a place abounding in history.’

Account manager Robert Jenkins, 45, added: ‘From the plans the lodges look beautiful and in a tranquil spot, yet in reality what you will have is a glorified Butlins holiday park overshadowing a wonderful castle.

‘The whole character of the castle will be lost if this goes ahead which will be a real shame.’

Merlin Entertainment’s plans state: ‘The castle is the most important landmark building and both the castle and parkland are of exceptionally high visual quality.

‘The proposed glamping tents will have no significant effect on the character and appearance of the wider or immediate sub-area of the Warwick Conservation Area, particularly given the relatively enclosed nature of the application site and given the site is well screened by the existing mature trees, dense foliage and shrubs.’
