A fashion label that used a bare-breasted nun as part of an advertising campaign is at the centre of a row over blasphemy in Naples, as Pope Francis prepares to visit the port city.

The giant billboard shows an image of a woman dressed in a nun's habit and jeans, with naked breasts.

The campaign by fashion label Rosso di Sera has caused controversy in the southern Italian city, ahead of a scheduled papal visit next weekend. 

'Obscene': Locals have expressed horror at fashion label Rosso di Sera's new billboard erected in Naples just one week ahead of the Pope's visit to the city 

Locals have denounced the image as 'obscene' and 'ugly' .

One Franciscan Facebook user said: 'I am an atheist but I find it offensive to intelligence, to women, to good taste and to faith.'

Other saw the 20 x30ft image in the city centre as a cynical marketing move.

But the company Rosso di Sera denied the billboard had been deliberately timed to cause a fuss.

Apology: The clothing firm has insisted 'there was no intent to blaspheme' adding that the company 'strongly regrets being accused of things extremely far from our values and our culture'

'We recognise that we have made a strong marketing choice but there was no intent to blaspheme,' the company said in a statement.

'Trivialising the act of prayer was not the intention in any way,' Rosso di Sera said, adding that the company 'strongly regrets being accused of things extremely far from our values and our culture.'

The Pope is set to visit Naples on March 21 and will also be visiting Pompeii on his trip.
