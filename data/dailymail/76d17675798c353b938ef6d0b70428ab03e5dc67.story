Two preschool teachers have been deregistered after admitting to trading ecstasy while children were present at the preschool.

Gemma Ward and Catherine Ngaire Williamson had their childcare licences revoked by the New Zealand Teachers Disciplinary Tribunal in a ruling released on Thursday.

The court heard Ms Ward gave Ms Williamson $150 for three tablets of MDMA during operating hours in Oanaka EduCare, reports MSN.

Ms Williamson was charged with supplying the Class B drug, which she pleaded guilty to. She evaded a conviction after the district judge accounted for the bullying she suffered at the workplace.

Ms Ward, who resigned amid the ordeal, did not face criminal conviction.

She admitted her wrongdoings to the tribunal, saying: 'I made a very bad snap decision'.

The childcare teacher said her mistake should not imply that she is unable to teach, as she has been doing so for nine years.

She requested she keep her teaching registration as she was planning to set up a new childcare facility in Lake Hawea.

The tribunal overruled her offer and said it was unsuitable for her to maintain her registration.

Williamson also attempted to retain her registration, claiming she obtained the drugs in a bid to show Ward her appreciation for supporting her when she was harassed at the workplace.

The tribunal rejected her claim, saying:'frankly, the proposition that for a teacher to deal in class B drugs on school premises does not reflect adversely on his or her fitness to be a teacher needs only to be stated to be roundly rejected.'
