Two passenger trains collided during this morning's rush hour, trapping the driver inside his carriage.

A moving locomotive crashed into the back of a stationary train at Kalafong station in Pretoria, South Africa, between Cor Delfos and Saulsville, injuring around 20 people. No deaths were reported.

Around 17 rescue vehicles were at the scene and the driver - in a critical condition - was airlifted by helicopter to a nearby hospital after being freed, a Tshwane emergency services spokesman said.

Metrorail spokesman Lillian 
Mofokeng told News24 that there were around 20 injuries after the 
incident near Church Street at 7:20am local time (5:20am GMT), which saw
both trains derail.

'There are two trains that have collided this morning,' Ms 
Mofokeng told Agence France-Presse. 'At this stage, we do not have any loss of life.' She added that it was not a head-on collision.

Two years ago more than 850 commuters were injured in Soweto, Johannesburg, when a passenger train crashed into a stationary train - a collision which also happened during rush hour, reported AFP.
