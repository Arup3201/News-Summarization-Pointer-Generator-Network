First lady Valerie Trierweiler is reported to be in hospital with depression following revelations of her husband's affair with an actress

French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was rushed to hospital following news of President Francois Hollande’s alleged affair, it was reported today.

News of his apparent romantic liaisons with an actress made her so depressed when she first heard about it on Thursday that she immediately sought medical treatment.

Today she was still in hospital, Le Parisien newspaper reported, citing sources close to the 48-year-old.

They said she had been prescribed 'lots of rest' and was not likely to come out of hospital 'for a few days'.

A spokeswoman for the first lady confirmed that Ms Trierweiler was admitted to hospital on Friday – the day Closer magazine came out.

Ms Trierweiler was ‘undergoing tests’ and being ‘left to rest’, the spokeswoman added.

Elysee Palace sources also confirmed the hospitilisation, saying Ms Trierweiler was likely to come out of the unnamed central Paris hospital on Monday.

It came as a news poll showed the vast majority of French people want President Hollande to separate from Ms Trierweiler.

This would result in her becoming the first Premiere Dame in history to be kicked out of the Elysee Palace.

She would be replaced by Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old actress who has allegedly been conducting a secret affair with the Socialist head of state since last year.

Le Point, the respected political weekly, is running an online poll which today shows 89 per cent of the French think Mr Hollande ‘should announce his separation from Valerie Trierweiler’.

The figure reflects mounting anger that the already deeply unpopular Paris Match journalist continues to maintain her own office at the Elysee Palace, and ‘represent’ France abroad.

MP Jean-Christophe Lagarde said: ‘She is not the wife of the president of the Republic, she plays the role of the first lady of France, when it appears that there is another first lady. The situation needs to be clarified very rapidly.’

Ms Trierweiler has made no formal comment since news of Mr Hollande’s apparent cheating was made public on Friday, but sources to her say she is ‘incensed and humiliated’ by the scandal.

There are claims that she and Mr Hollande have been living separate lives for months, and that the president is keen to ‘formalise’ his relationship with Ms Gayet.

This week French Closer magazine published pictures it claimed were of resident Francoise Hollande, Trierweiler's partner, sneaking into the apartment of Juliet Gayet

Mr Hollande’s relationship with Ms Gayet seemed to be exposed by a series of pictures in French Closer magazine which showed him travelling to see her on a moped.

But beyond a new romance, opponents claim the scandal exposes publicly-funded deceit, security lapses, and the enormous cost of a first lady who no longer has any legitimacy.

Mr Hollande, who turns 60 this year, was today said to be preparing a statement which would ‘clarify’ the position of Ms Trierweiler, a divorcee.

She currently has five staff working for her at her own office, as well as numerous other taxpayer-funded perks, including homes across France, and private jets and limousines at her disposal.

Catherine Nay, a leading political commentator and biographer, said ‘the question is whether Valerie Trierweiler can stay at the Elysee’, suggesting that her extreme ‘jealousy’ would make the current situation intolerable for all parties.

Photographers who watched a Paris flat a few hundred yards from the Elysee for several days said Mr Hollande regularly met Ms Gayet there, always wearing a crash helmet while entering and leaving the building in a weak attempt at disguise. 

Julie Gayet, 41, who has starred in several racy films, is rumoured to be having an affair with president Holland

Laurence Piau, the editor of Closer magazine, which broke the story, joined other commentators in saying that Mr Hollande was ‘clearly in love’ with his new girlfriend, and wanted a future with her.

Ms Gayet, who has two children with her estranged husband, 51-year-old Argentinian film director Santiago Amigorena, is very popular figure in France, having acted in around 20 films made for cinema and TV.

Ms Trierweiler has, in turn, been a deeply controversial figure since moving into the Elysee following Mr Hollande’s presidential election win in 2012.

Within a few months, she tweeted support for a politician standing in an election against Segolene Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children.

Ms Trierweiler and Ms Royal are not on speaking terms – causing huge problems for Mr Hollande, who was said to have taken Ms Trierweiler on as mistress while still living with Ms Royal.

It has also been well documented that Ms Trierweiler was at one stage still married when she became the shared mistress of both Mr Hollande and the conservative politician Patrick Devedjian.

The magazine front page, along with six pages of lurid details, left Ms Trierweiler 'incensed and humiliated'

Last year, businessman Xavier Kemlin made a formal criminal complaint against Ms Trierweiler, saying she was ‘embezzling’ public funds because she had no real status as first lady. However, judges later dismissed the allegation as being politically motivated.

Ms Trierweiler, a political affairs journalist, has been on the staff of the glossy Paris Match magazine for most of her career, yet regularly takes legal action over her private life.

Both Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet have pledged to take action over alleged breaches of privacy following the claims of their affair, though neither denies it.

Today’s Le Point poll is based on 12,888 people being asked if Mr Hollande should announced his separation from Ms Trierweiler. 11,500 answered ‘yes’.
