You might think it was a feat only achievable in the world of cartoons.

But that didn't stop one pair setting themselves the challenge of going on all 46 rides at Disney World in just one day.

And after running a total of 22 miles across all four parks in a frantic 17-hour dash, Shane Lindsay and Ted Tamburo, 46, can now celebrate the fulfilment of a childhood dream.

Mr Lindsay, 41, said: 'It's not like we're solving world hunger, but it's fun to have a little challenge that no-one has ever done before and people think is impossible.'

The pair met 20 years ago on a chat room dedicated to theme parks after revealing to each other that they both would visit Disney World every year as children, reports the New York Daily News.

They came up with the idea for the challenge after Mr Lindsay mentioned that he would often only have one day to visit the park, meaning he would try to fit in as many rides as possible.

Remarkably, the pair only met for the first time last year when they tried the attempt for the first time.

But bad weather meant three of the attractions - Tomorrowland, Speedway and Astro Orbiter - were closed by the end of the day.

They planned their second - and successful - attempt on November 7 and documented their exploits on their website.

After meticulous planning and armed FastPass tickets to skip the longer queues, they began they adventure at the Hollywood Studios at 8am.

They then also took all the open rides at the three other parks - Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom - with 15 minutes to spare before the site closed at 1am.

With the spare time, they chose to cap it all off by re-visiting four of the rides to finish with a round 50 for good measure.

'If you're an average guest here on vacation this is not something you want to be doing,' Lindsay told CNN.

'It's very much like running a marathon throughout the day.'
