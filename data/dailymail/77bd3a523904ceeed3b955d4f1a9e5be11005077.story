Ed Miliband’s elections chief Lucy Powell, above, confirmed the party ‘may use some investment borrowing’ to fund its manifesto if it wins

Labour yesterday admitted it will borrow billions more than the Tories – as experts warned the party’s plans would leave a £30billion black hole at the heart of the nation’s finances.

Ed Miliband’s elections chief Lucy Powell confirmed the party ‘may use some investment borrowing’ to fund its manifesto if it wins the election.

And the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour’s plans would potentially leave Britain with a permanent budget deficit – piling up massive debts for future generations.

The think tank’s director Paul Johnson said Labour’s proposals allowed it to maintain an overall deficit as high as £30billion by 2020 – at a time when the Tories aim to be running a surplus of £7billion to pay off Britain’s debts.

He told the BBC: ‘It is clear Labour want to do quite a lot less in terms of the total (deficit). They don’t want to get rid of the deficit altogether, they are happy to borrow to invest. They would be happy with a deficit of £25-30billion, whereas the Conservatives don’t want a deficit at all.’

Miss Powell later said she did not recognise the £30billion. But under pressure, she confirmed Labour would borrow to fund the Government’s investment spending, which is forecast to be about that amount by 2020.

‘We are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the Parliament,’ she said. ‘We may use some investment borrowing for much-needed investment but not for day-to-day spending. 

'Those figures are other people’s figures. It depends on what the books are like.’ Tory Treasury minister Priti Patel said Miss Powell had ‘let the cat out of the bag’. 

She added: ‘Labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they’d borrow more if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. Add in the fact that they’re refusing to admit which taxes they’d raise and you’ve got a recipe for total economic chaos.’

Miss Powell also clashed with BBC presenter Andrew Neil as he questioned Labour’s claims of an ‘explosion’ in the use of zero hours contracts. 

She snapped at him: ‘In the real world, Andrew where I live, OK, unlike where you live…’ Mr Neil hit back: ‘You’ve no idea where I live, just answer the question.’

Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party’s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told last September’s Labour conference that ‘in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing’.

But the fine print of Labour’s pledges show it has left itself flexibility to borrow the Government’s entire capital budget for spending on things such as roads, schools and railways.Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander yesterday warned Labour may set out no more details of its tax and spending plans before the election.

Critics point out its deficit reduction programme amounts to less than £1billion of cuts and the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, which experts warn may raise nothing. Challenged over Labour’s plans, Mr Alexander said: ‘We have set out our programme.’

Miss Powell said Labour was ‘very clear we can widen the tax base’ – suggesting the party plans to drag more people into paying tax. Labour later insisted this meant getting more people into better paid jobs so they would pay more tax and receive fewer benefits.

Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party’s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms. He is also expected to make a fresh attack on planned Tory cuts.

But former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn said he had to reach beyond Labour’s usual supporters to have any hope of winning. Mr Milburn told LBC radio: ‘Instead of going down to your core vote you have got to be reaching out to your non-core vote. Why? For a very pragmatic reason – if you are going to form a majority government you cannot really do it with 32.8 per cent of the vote.’

Meanwhile, the Tories also came under fire over their plans for £12 billion in welfare cuts after Iain Duncan Smith indicated the proposals may not be made public before the election. The Work and Pensions Secretary added: ‘When we are right and we are ready, we will talk about what we plan to do ...

‘(Voters) know for certain that we are going to save that £12 billion. We may, we may not, decide that it’s relevant to put something out there about some of those changes.’ 

 

Labour activists were in mutiny last night over this ‘shameful’ £5 mug boasting that the party would put controls on immigration.

The red cup, for sale on the fundraising section of Labour’s website, is one of five carrying its key election pledges.

Activists dubbed it the ‘Farage mug’, referring to the Ukip leader, and called on Labour to withdraw it and drop all plans to control migration.

But the controversy led to a surge in sales. By last night almost 250 of the mugs had been sold compared to just six of the ones promoting Labour’s vow to create a ‘strong economic foundation’.

Veteran left-winger Diane Abbott said: ‘This shameful mug is an embarrassment. But the real problem is that immigration controls are one of our pledges at all.’

It comes after Labour was branded patronising for using a pink bus to attract women voters.

A party spokesman defended the mugs, saying: ‘Labour has five election pledges. This is one.’
