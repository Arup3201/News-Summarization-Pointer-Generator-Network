Leeds United chairman Ken Bates has been ordered to pay £10,000 to an ex-director who sued him for harassment.

Melvyn Levi and his wife Carole claimed they suffered stress as a result of announcements on the club radio station allegedly likening Mr Levi to a criminal on the run.

They also claimed comments made by Mr Bates in his match day programme notes amounted to speculation over the state of their marriage.

Mr Levi was awarded £10,000 in compensation at Leeds County Court but his wife’s claim failed.

Judge Mark Gosnell said: 'Mr Levi has succeeded in his claim and has been awarded £10,000 and Mrs Levi’s claim has failed.

Mr Bates is also now subject to an injunction banning him from discussing Mr Levi’s private life in public for two years.

But the Leeds chairman is allowed to mention the on-going commercial dispute between the two, known as the 'Jersey proceedings', as well as other non-private matters.

Explaining why he was granting the injuction, the judge said: 'I cannot think of a better reason than the delving into Mr Levi’s private life in what is a commercial dispute between Mr Levi and Mr Bates which I hope will be resolved by someone else on another day.'

Mr Levi claimed radio announcements asking for information on his whereabouts during a Leeds match on Boxing Day 2010 likened him to 'a fugitive'.

Over that Christmas period, Mr Bates was trying to serve a writ against Mr Levi but found out from his wife that he was away until the new year.

The Leeds chairman was pursuing legal action against Mr Levi for £190,400 Mr Bates claims he and another party owed the club - the subject of the Jersey proceedings.

At an earlier hearing, Mr Bates was 
accused of using the club’s programme to pursue a personal vendetta and 
make the lives of the Levis 'a misery' after he wrote an article in 
January last year speculating on why the couple had 'split' over the 
festive season.

In 2009
Mr Levi sued Mr Bates for libel over articles written in the programme 
and the Leeds chairman was ordered to pay £50,000 damages plus costs to 
Mr Levi.

Mr
Bates, Leeds United and Yorkshire Radio have been ordered to pay the 
damages, their own legal costs and 30% of the Levis’ legal costs.

It
emerged during the case that the Boxing Day 2010 radio announcement was
played numerous times and a similar message had been broadcast on two 
days in the previous week.

The
announcement said: 'Leeds United are currently searching for the 
whereabouts of Melvyn Levi to serve him some papers in relation to a 
High Court action in Jersey.

'Now, if you’ve seen the former Leeds United director, you’re being asked to get in touch with Yorkshire Radio and let us know where and when you saw him.'

Mr Bates’s programme notes of January 1 2011, entitled 'Onwards and Upwards', said: 'As I write, we have not served Mr Levi with his writ as his wife said he was away until New Year which makes me speculate as to why they split for the festive season.

'No matter, the procedure will be processed in 2011. Watch this space for continuing exciting news of a saga which will soon challenge Coronation Street as a long-running soap.'

In his written judgment, Judge Gosnall said he was convinced Mr Bates’s comments had genuinely upset Mr Levi and said it had affected the claimant's life.

Referring to Mr Levi he said: 'He has low mood and anxiety, constantly ruminates on why the first defendant (Mr Bates) has had such a grudge against him for so long, he has sleep disturbance, a sense of fear and is on edge.

'He says the thing he fears the most is being accosted or attacked as a result of all the things which have been said about him.'
