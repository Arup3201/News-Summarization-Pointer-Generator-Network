Roger Federer eased into the second round of the Australian Open on Monday with a straight-sets victory over Yen-Hsun Lu, win No 1,001 of his amazing career.

Seeking his 18th grand slam title and first in Melbourne since 2010, Federer was in complete command against the world No 47, winning 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 in one hour and 53 minutes on Rod Laver Arena.

The 33-year-old fired nine aces and won 86 per cent of points on his first serve and will face Simone Bolelli in the last 64 after the Italian defeated Argentina's Juan Monaco in four sets

'I thought it was a really good level,' Federer said. 'Lu played a tough match and I really had to step it up. I've played him before so knew what he was capable of.

'The season is still early and it's tough to get rhythm, especially in the first round but it was a nice match.'

Federer, who recorded his 1,000th win in the final of the Brisbane International earlier this month, has never lost in the first round of the Australian Open and there was never any danger of that record being broken.

One break of serve was enough to secure the opening set and two more gave him the second, although the second seed did have to save two break points when serving at 5-2.

There were a few signs of frustration from Federer as he battled to gain another break in the third set, the Swiss star having to wait until the 11th game to end Lu's brave resistance.
