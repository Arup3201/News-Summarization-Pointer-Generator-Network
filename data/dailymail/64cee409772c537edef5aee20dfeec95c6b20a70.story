The head of Labour’s biggest union donor today called on Ed Miliband to stop wooing middle class voters and increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour immediately.

Unite chief Len McCluskey said the Scottish referendum had exposed the anger of working class voters ignored by the main political parties. He said it was time for Labour to stop tailoring policies to ‘a few marginal voters in southern England’ and to focus on ‘working people’.

Mr McCluskey dismissed Labour's pledge to increase the minimum wage by £1.50 over the next five years and attacked Ed Balls's plan to make real terms cuts to child benefit. 

He said: ‘We’ve been calling for a £1.50 increase in the minimum wage with immediate effect, not over a five-year period so we’d hope to continue to battle.’

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said Labour should stop trying to appeal to middle class voters in the south

Mr McCluskey also slammed David Cameron’s bid to ban Scottish MPs from voting on English-only laws. He said his Union did not was a constitution ‘made by posh boys in Chequers’.

In a fiery speech to the Labour conference in Manchester today, the Unite firebrand said the party was losing working-class voters. 

Earlier, Mr McCluskey said over the last few weeks people had begun to realise that ‘working people – our people – were turning their backs’ on Labour.

He said: ‘But even after the SNP started winning Scottish parliament seats in the east end of Glasgow, some in the Scottish Labour party clung to the mantra of wooing the middle classes

‘It took a referendum campaign to remind us that you ignore the hopes of working people at your political peril.’

Ed Miliband needed to learn the lessons from the Scottish referendum, Mr McCluskey said

Mr McCluskey said the support for independence in Scotland was not an ‘upsurge of narrow nationalism’. 

He said: ‘It was an upsurge in defence of our NHS. An upsurge against illegal wars. An upsurge against endless austerity. And against inequality.’

The Unite general secretary claimed Alex Salmond led a movement which was ‘a triumph of hope against apathy and fear’.

He urged Labour to take a leaf out of Mr Salmond’s book and fight to win back working-class voters.

He said: ‘We have to lead the fight for those aspirations, in every corner of our nations, over the next eight months, because it’s not just Scottish working people that want change.

‘Working people, young and old, throughout England and Wales have also had enough - had enough of the attack on the health service and the gains of 1945. Had enough talk of economic credibility which means credibility with the bond markets - but not with the unemployed.’

He claimed many poorer voters had also had enough ‘of policies trimmed and tailored to a few marginal voters in southern England’.

To loud applause from delegates, Mr McCluskey said the Scottish referendum should be the tombstone on 20 years of Labour's ‘indifference’ to the interests of workers.
