An Afghan hound is top dog for fashion after he was spotted showing off this stylish tartan snood.

Two-year-old Ari has become a minor celebrity in his home town of Blackburn, Lancashire, after locals expressed their love of the strange garment, which keeps his flowing black hair out of his mouth and eyes.

The award-winning pup wears the custom-made accessory when out walking and when he eats to avoid getting food in his well-groomed hair.

Without the garment, the dog's flowing black hair gets in his eyes, meaning he cannot see where he is going

Owner Mark White said: 'You wouldn't believe how often we get stopped when I take him out for walks.

'People always want to know why he's wearing the snood and I have to take it off to show them his long hair. He certainly gets a lot of attention.'

Mr White, who owns two Afghan hounds, added: 'We have always used snoods as they help keep hair out of the dog's face.

'Many people just use them for eating to make mealtimes less messy, but we also use them when we are out walking so that Ari can see where he is going.

'The snood helps to keep their long coats from getting into their eyes and mouth.

'If the hair did get stuck they would chew on it to try and get it out - and we couldn't enter him into shows if he had one ear shorter than the other.'

The pup also wears the snood when eating so that he does not get food in the long hair on his head

Owner Mark White says his dog is a huge hit in Blackburn, where locals regularly stop and ask about the snood

Ari is not the only one bringing the snood back into fashion and a similar garment made an appearance  when a man dubbed 'Scarf Guy' stole the show at the Apple iPhone 6 launch on Tuesday.

Gaming executive Tommy Krul wore a purple knit scarf when he demonstrated a game at the high profile event, sparking a wave of interest in the fashion accessories online.

Mr White added: 'The dogs don't mind wearing the scarves at all, he has been wearing one since he was a small puppy so he is completely used to it.

'We used to have three Afghan Hounds, so you can imagine how much attention they got when I took them out together.

'The head scarves can be bought from all champ shows, and they are often custom made to fit each individual dog.'

Ari competes in dog shows almost every weekend and recently won best in class in the Minor Puppy section of the Northern Afghan Hound Show in St Helens, Merseyside.

Mr White, 47, who also owns a 13-year-old Afghan called Ola, added: 'Ari is such a fun dog to be around - but he is quite mischievous.

'He competes in dog shows very regularly but Afghans mature quite late so he still acts like a puppy and sometimes can act a bit daft when he is in the arena.'

The dog's fashion hit comes after gaming executive Tommy Krul - dubbed 'Scarf Guy' - was praised for wearing a similar garment at Apple's iPhone 6 launch this week
