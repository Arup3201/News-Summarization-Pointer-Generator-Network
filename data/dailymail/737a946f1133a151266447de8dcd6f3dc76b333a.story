A mother has told how her daughter was left unconscious after a hospital issued medicine that was incorrectly labelled.

Three-year-old Ruby Plummer was diagnosed with epilepsy last March, a condition which affects the brain and causes seizures.

The youngster was prescribed buccal 
midazolam, a 
muscle relaxant which is rubbed into the gums and used to treat prolonged attacks lasting five minutes or more.

However her mother Helen, 29, claims the bottle she was
given at James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, Teesside, recommended  2.5ml doses instead of 0.25ml.

And on one occasion she was told to double the measure because it had taken so long 
for Ruby to recover from a seizure - meaning she gave her daughter a dose 20 times higher than the recommended amount.

As a result, Ruby lost consciousness and her family feared the worst.

Mrs Plummer, from Marske, Cleveland, said: 'Her lips went blue and we thought we had lost her.

'She deteriorated drastically and stopped breathing and went blue. She vomited and was choking.

'It was horrendous. She was in hospital for the whole night. The doctors didn't notice that she had been given too much. It was me that noticed.

'I'm angry and annoyed. I feel let down.'

NHS guidelines suggest that children aged six months to 12 months, should be given a 0.25ml dose of buccal 
midazolam, while those  aged one to four should be prescribed 0.5ml.

As a precaution, each time Mrs Plummer uses the medication with her daughter she returns to hospital for a check-up. 

But she claims that during visits medics never questioned the dose she was administering and it was only when her daughter lost consciousness that it was clear something was wrong.

She added: 'When I looked at it I thought 'that's a lot' but I thought the doctor was right. I have not been to medical school.'

Since the incident Mrs Plummer who is married to John, 24, and has a son Liam, seven months, has issued a complaint.

South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust confirmed they are investigating the case and have apologised to the family.

A spokesperson said: 'We are very sorry for any distress and anxiety that Ruby's family have experienced.

'We take every complaint we receive 
very seriously and are currently carrying out our own investigation into
this case which is ongoing and, as such, it would be inappropriate to 
comment further at this stage.'

According to the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) database, midazolam overdoses should not present a threat to life unless the patient has pre-existing respiratory or cardiac problems and it is combined with other central nervous system depressants.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said as it is a fairly new medication, it is regularly being monitored.
