A convicted bribe-taker in President Barack Obama's political backyard, and at least two other public servants accused of felonies, are seeking office in Tuesday's Illinois Democratic primary elections.

Former Chicago city alderman Isaac 'Ike' Carothers spent 28 months in prison for taking bribes, and was released in March 2012. He's running for commissioner of the Cook County board, among the most powerful positions in the Chicago metropolitan area.

Carothers followed the family legacy established by his father, who once held the same position before going to prison for official corruption.

The younger Carothers accepted a $9,000 bribe, and was accused of committing to accept another $100,000, from a man who wanted help securing government approval to open up at least five restaurants in Chicago's two commercial airports.

He also accepted home repairs worth $40,000, plus campaign money and sports tickets, in exchange for fixing a zoning case.

Chicago Alderman Isaac 'Ike' Carothers, chairman of the Chicago City Council's police and fire committee, pleaded guilty to corruption charges in 2010, but he's itching to get back into city politics

The Chicago way? Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison 18 corruption convictions, including trying to to auction off President Barack Obama's former U.S. Senate seat

He was also fond of setting aside high-paying summer government jobs for his children and paying them out of specialized slush funds.

'All of us [aldermen] have family members on the payroll," the younger Carothers told the Chicago Tribune n 2009.

Two other high-profile Democratic politicians with serious corruption problems are on primary ballots in Illinois.

State Representative La Shawn K. Ford is running for re-election – unopposed – despite facing a criminal trial on bank fraud charges stemming from his business activities before he ran for office in 2006. He was indicted in late 2012.

He has been charged with bank fraud for allegedly lying in 2006 on a $500,000 application for a line of credit. Ford claimed he would use the money to fix up decrepit real estate in Chicago, but prosecutors say he used the money to pay for his personal expenses.

Ford is running unopposed in his primary.

And Derrick Smith, another Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, faces a possible 10-year prison sentence in connection with a $7,000 bribe he allegedly accepted from a man who said he wanted a letter of recommendation for a $50,000 grant to open a day care center.

It was a set-up, though, orchestrated by a campaign worker who was an FBI informant: The day-care plan never existed.

Illinois Reps. La Shawn Ford (L) and Derrick Smith (R) are running for seats in the state legislature despite clouds of corruption, and both are favored to win

Mel Reynolds, a former congressman who went to prison for having sex with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, ran for the jailed Jesse Jackson Jr.'s old U.S. House seat in 2012 on a campaign theme of 'redemption,' but was beaten handily

The Illinois House expelled Smith in 2012 after criminal charges were laid against him, but months later he won back his seat in a special election. As his trial date looms, he's running again and is favored to win.

Democrat Michael Madigan, the powerful Illinois house speaker, is supporting both Smith and Ford.

'We're backing the incumbents," Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told Reuters, saying both men are innocent until proven guilty in court.

'That's how America works,' Brown said.

An aide to an Illinois Republican congressman told MailOnline on Tuesday that the GOP won't likely reap political benefits from Democrats' lapses.

'I wish we could take advantage,' he said, requesting anonymity, 'but Illinois is a blue state and a universe unto itself. It would be easier for us to land on the sun than to get a Republican elected to those seats.'

'And when you have sitting politicians scratching each others' backs within their own political machine, it's hard to throw the bums out.'

George Ryan, the corrupt former Illinois governor, spent five years in prison for official corruption before his release in 2013

Not every Democrat in positions of power is helping the ethically challenged candidates, however.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is urging voters to shy away from Ike Carothers.

But the convict is hoping for a clean slate.

'I believe in a God that believes in second 
chances,' Carothers told a television audience in December. 'And I hope that the voters in this [Chicago] district will give me a 
second chance.'.

The situation in Illinois is 'a terrible indictment' of the local political culture, added former Chicago Alderman Dick Simpson, now a University of Illinois at Chicago professor.

'There is still a patronage-based political army on the West Side of Chicago.'

Illinois politicians are famous for playing fast and loose with the public's trust: U.S. Justice Department statistics rank Chicago as the nation's most corrupt city.

Since 1976 there have been 1,531 public corruption convictions in that one city, and the problem extends to the state capital of Springfield.

Former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich is serving a 14-year prison sentence for political corruption after he was convicted of trying to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate after Barack Obama assumed the presidency.

Blagojevich replaced Republican Gov. George Ryan, who spent five years in federal prison for racketeering.

The exception that proves the rule? President Barack Obama doesn't appear tainted by the smarmy politics in his home town, but ethical challenges of a different kind are dogging him in his second term

Ryan's crime involved taking bribes from unqualified truck drivers in exchange for providing them with hauling licenses while he was Illinois Secretary of State.

Expanding Illinois' smarmy legacy, Jesse Jackson Jr., a former state representative and son of the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson Sr., pleaded guilty last month to misusing $750,000 in campaign funds to fund his and his wife's lavish lifestyles.

The younger Jackson's purchases included a $43,350 gold Rolex watch. He will be sentenced later this year.

Former Illinois Congressman Mel Reynolds' corruption chronicles, however, may be the state's most colorful and disturbing.

Reynolds went to prison in the 1990s for the statutory rape of a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, and for bank fraud.

He was arrested in Zimbabwe in Feburary after allegedly making 100 pornographic films and taking 2,000 naked pictures in hotels.

Mere possession of pornography is a crime in that African nation.

But a judge dismissed the charges weeks later and deported him, back to Illinois.
