Shaquille O'Neal has applied for a job as a reserve police officer with the Miami Beach Police Department.

The 42-year-old, who spent the majority of his career with LA Lakers and Miami Heat, is believed to be serious about his interest in the role. 

But a spokeswoman for the city council, Christina Baguer, told the Miami Herald that he would be given no preferential treatment.

Reserve: Shaquille O'Neill has applied to become a reserve police officer with the Miami Beach PD

She said: 'If he passes (the first stage of the application), he will then have to do everything else to be certified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, just like any of our other officers, reserve or not reserve,'

This is not the first time the four-time NBA champion has expressed an interest in working with the police.

In 2005 O'Neill worked with the Miami Beach, again as a reserve officer.

Interest: O'Neill worked as a reserve officer in Miami in 2005, and in 2003 he also posed in an LAPD uniform

Miami: O'Neill played for Miami Heat between 2004 and 2008, where he won the NBA Championship
