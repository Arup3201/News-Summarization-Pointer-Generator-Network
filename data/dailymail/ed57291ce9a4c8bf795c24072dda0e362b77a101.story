A female lawn bowls player has been banned from competing for her local team, because the league claims women are 'not as good as men'.

Claire Williams, 51, helped get Burway Bowling Club in Ludlow, Shropshire into the top lawn bowls division in the county last year.

However, the Shropshire Premier Bowling League (SPBL) has a strict male-only policy and its president has today pledged to 'fight vehemently' to keep her and other women players out.

Banned champion: Burway Bowling Club are trying to overturn the ban on women players in the Shropshire Premier Bowling League after Claire Williams, 51, (front) was not allowed to play for her team

Ms Williams' club are appealing to overturn the 21-year-old rule after branding the league regulations old-fashioned and outdated. 

But Mike Hinton, 73, president of the SPBL, has said there is 'no way' the league will allow a change in the rules and allow women to play.

'The plain fact is we don't think they are good enough,' Mr Hinton said, adding that Burway Bowling Club made a similar - unsuccessful - appeal for change last year. 

Sexist rules: The league's president has said he will 'fight vehemently' to keep female players like Claire Williams out

'I would put my house and £1,000 on it not being passed again this year. 

'I will be fighting vehemently to make sure women are not allowed to join our league. 

'One of the middle leagues changed the rules  and they started putting women's names down on the team sheet before men, I couldn't believe it.

'I have been president for 13 years and I am standing down tomorrow, but there is no way we will let this rule change pass.

'The simple reason is because men are generally better players than women.'

Ms Williams, who works for the Ministry of Defence, led her side to the top of the Flowfit Ludlow & District Bowls League last year, allowing the team to play in the top county league.

However, this achievement also meant that Ms Williams had to be dropped from the team because of the men-only rule.

When the issue was raised at the Shropshire Premier Bowling League annual meeting last year, many teams had not held their annual general meetings to discuss the matter, so it was voted down. 

Yesterday Duncan Pressley, captain of the Burway Bowling Club,  said it was time the sport caught up with the times.

He said: 'We put a letter in last year asking why women couldn't be included in teams in the league.

'Obviously it was in our interest to have Claire as part of our team.

'She was one of the best players we had and not just of the ladies - she's better than a lot of the men.

'Claire doesn't play for us anymore, but it wasn't just about her.

'Somebody has got to be the first one to put up their hands and say in this day and age should we still be doing this?

Outdated views: President Mike Hinton, 73,  said there is 'no way' the Shropshire Premier Bowling League will approve Burway's appeal for change as 'women are not as good as men'.

'It's probably the only league in the county which doesn't allow women to play. Ludlow and District has been a mixed league for 15 to 20 years.

'Most sports that aren't intensely physical these days are coming round to the idea that women can be allowed to compete alongside men.

'Look at golf, where women are now allowed in the club house at St..Andrews.

'There are ladies' leagues, obviously, but just within localised areas as far as I know.

'I know of several clubs that wouldn't have a problem with this, we have women that are good enough players just stood on the side watching.

'I think these things need to be looked at in today's world.'
