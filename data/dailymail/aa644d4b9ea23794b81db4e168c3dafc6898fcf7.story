Fell asleep: Ex-England footballer Paul Merson arrives at Leamington Spa Magistrates' Court, where he pleaded guilty to crashing his Mercedes while over the drink-drive limit

Ex-England footballer Paul Merson has been given a 14-month driving ban after a court heard how he crashed his Mercedes into a 38-tonne military truck while over the legal alcohol limit.

Leamington Spa Magistrates’ Court was told that the former Arsenal and Aston Villa star, who pleaded guilty to drink-driving, fell asleep at the wheel on the M40.

Merson, who suffered a head injury in the accident last October, was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay £105 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Twice-married Merson, who won two league titles with Arsenal, has fought a well-documented addiction to gambling, alcohol and drugs for more than two decades which drove him to brink of suicide.

In 2003, the father-of-five claimed to have won his battles with alcohol and cocaine, but admitted that he was still plagued by his gambling problem.

He narrowly avoided losing his home five years later after falling behind with his mortgage payments, and in his recently-released memoir, How Not To Be A Professional Footballer, revealed he had lost some £7million to bookmakers over the years.

Magistrates heard today how the Sky Sports pundit was driving to his home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, after having 'a few drinks' at a charity event in London.

Merson’s Mercedes ML350 struck the rear of a Ministry of Defence lorry, damaging its rear lights and under-run bars, at about 3.15am on October 12.

Prosecutor Philippa Cowley said Merson, who was among several people who called the police, failed a roadside breath-test and was later found to have 124mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit is 80mg.

Merson, 43, was standing on the hard shoulder when two police constables arrived at the scene, said Ms Cowley.

'It was clear that he had got a head injury and he was very frank with the police,' the lawyer told the court.

Had a few drinks: The Sky Sports pundit was driving a black Mercedes SUV, like the one pictured, when he crashed

'He said that he had fallen asleep and had been at a charity do for children and had had a few drinks.'

Jane Winchester, chairwoman of the magistrates, told him: "You are disqualified from driving for 14 months.

'If you do drive while disqualified you will be committing a serious offenceand you might be send to prison, do you understand?'Merson, who stared at the floor throughout the 25-minute hearing, replied:'Yes'.

Problems: Merson celebrates with Paul Gascoigne during their time together at Middlesbrough. Merson claims he left the club because of its 'drinking culture'

The former player - who also represented Middlesbrough andPortsmouth - was pictured leaving hospital after the crash with bloodstains on the sleeves of his white shirt and a nasty gash above his eye.The lorry driver escaped the crash uninjured - though there wasdamage caused to the rear side and under-run bars of his vehicle. Steven Masih, mitigating, told the court Merson drove home after failingto book a hotel room in London. 

He said: 'Mr Merson is deeply disappointed with this situation. It was a grave error of judgement. 

'Mr Merson has a very busy schedule not with football. He is a family man, he has five children. He did not go out with the intention of drinking but when he was there he had a few drinks.'

Well-documented addiction: Merson famously celebrated after the 1993 Coca-Cola Cup final by pretending to down drinks

He added: 'He accepts driving on an empty stomach was not necessarily a good idea. It was a grave error of judgement, but he thought it was safe for him to drive home because he was not particularly drunk.'He is deeply remorseful and deeply regretful. It was out of character, anisolated incident, an error which he is adamant will not happen again.'

Merson refused to comment as he left court.

But speaking after the incident he said he was 'lucky to have survived'.

He said: 'I fell asleep and just hit the central reservation. I banged my head on the windscreen and the car is a write-off.

He has also agreed to attend a 16-hour rehabilitation course by October, which will reduce his ban by 14 weeks.

Accused: Notts County footballer Lee Hughes leaves Croydon Magistrates' Court today after pleading not guilty to sexual assault

Notts County footballer Lee Hughes denied a sexual assault charge today.

The striker was arrested after police were called to his team’s hotel in Croydon, south London, on December 3.

Hughes, 35, was taken into custody following the alleged incident the night before his team’s FA Cup fixture against Sutton United.

He was released on bail before being charged at the end of last month.

He elected to be tried at Crown Court at the five-minute hearing at Croydon Magistrates’ Court today.

Hughes, who wore a dark grey suit, white shirt and dark tie, showed no emotion as he sat in the dock.

Chairman of the bench Bill Whitmarsh granted Hughes unconditional bail.

The case was adjourned until a further hearing at the same court on March 21.

Hughes, of Waterside Way, Nottingham, is accused of sexually touching a woman at the Aerodrome Hotel, Purley Way, Croydon.

The footballer, who has previously played in the Premier League for West Brom, made no comment to reporters as he left the court.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
