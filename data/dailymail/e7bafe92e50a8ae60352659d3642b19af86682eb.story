When Emily Scarratt lines up the kicks which may finally propel England to World Cup glory tomorrow, she will block out the noise and tension around her by imagining she is submerged in water – calm and quiet.

Every goal-kicker has a tried and trusted routine to cope with the extreme individual pressure of their role. Jonny Wilkinson used to visualise the imaginary ‘Doris’ behind the posts and aim to knock a can of Coke out of her hand. Leigh Halfpenny pictures being far away from crowds and cameras; back at Gorseinon RFC, practising with his grandfather.

Scarratt has her own formula to deal with the high-stakes duty she is performing for England at the women’s World Cup in Paris and it is serving the Lichfield centre well.

Ahead of the final against Canada at a sold-out Stade Jean Bouin, the 24-year-old said: ‘We are playing in front of bigger crowds now which creates distractions so I try to block it all out. I think of it as being under water. I try to imagine that dull sound – almost silence – there is under water and that helps me focus. Then I take a big deep breath and just do what I always do when I kick a ball. It comes very instinctively now.’

That instinct has been honed over many years, since Scarratt – from Leicester – began playing rugby at the age of five. When she wasn’t at Welford Road supporting the Tigers, she was honing her skills with an unorthodox routine.

‘I grew up on a farm, so I used to practise kicking from my garden into a field,’ she said. ‘I only had two balls to practise with so I had to keep going backwards and forwards to retrieve them!’

Aside from this commitment to enhancing her shooting skills, which led to goal-kicking for an Under 18 team at the age of just 13, Scarratt would watch Geordan Murphy running amok for Leicester and yearn to emulate his attacking flair.

Rugby was one of many sporting pursuits and she turned down a basketball scholarship in America at 16, after catching the eye on a tour there. 

That decision paid off. She made her England debut at 18 and reached a career target of 50 Test caps this year. Her supreme performance in the 40-7 semi-final win over Ireland drew widespread praise.

Fourth time lucky? England want victory after losing the last three consecutive tournaments to New Zealand

With a half-century of Test appearances already, the next grand ambition is a collective one. England suffered an agonisingly narrow defeat in the home World Cup Final four years ago to finish as runners-up to New Zealand for the third consecutive tournament. Gary Street’s squad are hell-bent on making it fourth time lucky.

‘For some girls, this is their third opportunity, for a lot of us the second and for others the first, but we have all shared so many experiences and we can take that into the final,’ said Scarratt. ‘There is a real desire to perform well and if we do, the result will take care of itself.’
