Clare Atkinson, 29, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer one and a half weeks ago 

Clare Atkinson was in high spirits when she visited her local GP with stomach cramps, having just returned from a nine month trip around Australia with her partner.

But the remainder of the 29-year-old's travel plans were instantly cut short only three weeks ago, after a couple of blood tests led to the detection of a growth in her liver.

Ms Atkinson, who formerly worked as a journalist for the ABC in Sydney, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer within weeks of the discovery. 

With doctors unable to predict how much time she has left, Ms Atkinson is determined to make the most of her life, proposing to her partner of four and a half years, Lewis, 28.

'It wasn't a proposal in the true sense,' Ms Atkinson told Daily Mail Australia.

'If I hadn't been diagnosed I'm not sure we would have gotten married yet because we had other things that we wanted to do first like travelling and buying an apartment.

'It's one of those things that I always thought I'd be able to do and because the doctors don't know what kind of time frame they're looking at, it was something that I could do when other things had been taken away from me. 

'It will be a nice distraction, something to look forward to and think about instead of thinking about the chemotherapy… It's an opportunity for us to celebrate our life together and just forget about it for one night.' 

The former ABC journalist, who displayed no symptoms other than stomach cramps, proposed to her partner of four and a half years, Lewis (left), whom she plans to wed in January next year

A donation page for the couple's January wedding, which was secretly set up by Ms Atkinson's close friend Amelia Freelander to help them as they direct their savings to medical costs, has already raised almost $9000 since it was set up four days ago.

'I had a list of our friends and colleagues to contact to tell them the news and each person was so shocked and one of the things they all said was "what can we do? How can we help her right now?" and I said "well, actually one of things that she talked to me about was that she and her partner were hoping to get married",' Ms Freelander told Daily Mail Australia. 

But Ms Atkinson, who still shows no symptoms of her cancer other than occasional mild stomach pain, has also taken it upon herself to use her story as an example and encourage others to undertake regular blood analyses.

'If I hadn't happened to go in and get a blood test I never would've have found it and I'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late. It could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time,' Ms Atkinson said.

'If I hadn't happened to go in and get a blood test I never would've have found it and I'd be living in ignorance until it really was too late. It could be the thing to save your life or give you a bit more time,' Ms Atkinson, who lives a healthy lifestyle, said

'I never really realised something was wrong, I just went to my GP with stomach cramps I'd had and I went in thinking I had indigestion problems or something minor.' 

But two blood tests revealed the journalist had poor liver results, leading to a CT scan that showed a huge growth in the vital organ. 

'That was the first time that we knew something was wrong, but at that point not even my doctor realised how bad it was and still thought it could be a benign tumour or a weird growth. It just snowballed from there,' Ms Atkinson said. 

Ms Atkinson's first indication of a problem came after two blood tests showed poor liver function 

A CT scan then showed a huge growth in her liver. Soon after, she underwent keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing. A laparoscopy, in which a camera was inserted into her stomach, finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer

She was immediately admitted to hospital where she underwent numerous CT scans and MRIs as well as keyhole surgery in order to send a sample of her tissue to a lab for testing. A laparoscopy, in which a camera was inserted into her stomach, finally confirmed she had terminal liver cancer. 

'But it's a secondary liver cancer which means it's starting somewhere else and spreading to my liver,' Ms Atkinson explained.

'But they don't know where the source is yet or whether they'll ever know. If they know the source the chemotherapy can be more targeted and there's more chance of it helping or being successful.'

Despite only learning of her exact diagnosis one and a half weeks ago and preparing to undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next Monday, Ms Atkinson says she can't help but feel somewhat grateful.

She will undergo six weeks of chemotherapy next week, however doctors have been unable to determine how much time she has left

'As you'd expect the first few days [after being diagnosed] were pretty emotional, but there are mixed emotions.

'You feel a sense of despair that you can't describe, but there's also an element of gratefulness that you have time to do more things – it's not like I'm in pain or had any symptoms or anything, which is why it has come as such a shock.

'I feel as normal as I ever did, I just have it in the back of my mind now that this is growing inside of me.'

Ms Atkinson encourages anyone affected by cancer who is seeking counselling, support or even financial assistance, to contact the Cancer Council.
