Two senior peers are set to be suspended from the House of Lords after an inquiry into a ‘cash for access’ scandal.

Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate is set to be barred for just six months and Lord Laird for just four, following recommendations by the privileges and conduct committee.  

After this time, both will be free to return to the Lords, where they are entitled to a £300-a-day allowance simply for turning up.

Their light punishments have been 
branded a ‘slap on the wrist’ and will fuel concerns about the ability 
of politicians to police their own conduct.

The
 pair were found guilty of multiple breaches of the Lords’ code of 
conduct after offering to promote the interests of a fictional firm in 
return for cash.

Both were 
found to have broken rules requiring peers to ‘act always on their 
personal honour’ following an investigation by Commissioner for 
Standards Paul Kernaghan.

They
 were among three peers recorded by undercover Sunday Times reporters 
posing as representatives of the fictitious South Korean solar energy 
company.

Former Labour minister Lord Cunningham of Felling was cleared of any breach of the Lords Code of Conduct

Former Cabinet 
minister Lord Cunningham of Felling, who was suspended by Labour earlier
 this year, was recorded suggesting a £12,000-a-month fee for work that 
included introducing them to ministers.

But the Lords’ investigation found there was ‘insufficient evidence’ that he breached the code of conduct.

Lord Mackenzie, a former president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, was found guilty of four breaches.

He
 was recorded explaining how he could dodge rules banning peers from 
hosting an event in the Palace of Westminster on behalf of groups who 
pay them.

Lord Laird, who 
was found guilty of three breaches, said he could get other peers to ask
 parliamentary questions on the company’s behalf.

Both men offered to help set up an all-party parliamentary group on solar energy as a lobbying vehicle as part of the deal.

Lord
 Laird was also recorded by the BBC’s Panorama programme suggesting a 
fee of £2,000 a month to help set up an all-party group to lobby on 
behalf of Fiji.

Senior 
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, who campaigns for reform of the 
Lords, said the punishments were a ‘slap on the wrist’ and called for a 
major shake-up of the archaic proceedings to restore public trust.

He
 added: ‘Now that we have over 800 members of our over-stuffed House of 
Lords, expecting us all to act always on our personal honour is a relic 
of a bygone age.

'We need to be tougher because these short-term suspensions don’t stop the scandals'

Lord Oakeshott

‘We need to be tougher because these short-term suspensions don’t stop the scandals.’

Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt called Lord Laird’s behaviour ‘a very serious lapse in judgment’.

Lord O’Neill of Clackmannan, another Labour peer investigated by the Sunday Times, has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

Crossbench
 peer Lord Oxburgh was found guilty of an unrelated breach for failing 
to register his position on the advisory board of the Real Asset Energy 
Fund. He apologised and was not punished.
