On the run: Eugene Palmer, pictured, is armed and dangerous in the woods, police believe

A 73-year-old grandfather wanted for the fatal shooting of his daughter-in-law, had previously threatened to kill a Department of Environmental Conservation officer, police said.

Eugene Palmer, of Stony point, New York, is on the run after allegedly confronting 39-year-old Tammy Palmer with his shotgun as she returned home from putting her two children on the school bus.

Having killed her, he then went on the run, police said, confessing his crime to his sister and fleeing the area.

As detectives investigated the brutal
slaying of the young mother, they revealed the sordid details of 
Palmer's criminal past and warned that he is believed to be dangerous - 
owing to a large gun collection.

He was first arrested and charged 
with second-degree aggravated harassment after he made repeated 'life 
threatening' calls to DEC employee Kenneth Didion’s home over a period 
of months starting in December 1984, The Journal News reported.

Palmer, working as a truck driver at 
the time, pleaded guilty in April 1986 and the next month was sentenced 
to one year probation and fined $750. He also was ordered to avoid any 
contact with Didion for a year.

In this latest case, Palmer is 
accused of killing his daughter-in-law, with whom he had a cagey 
relationship, on Monday. She was found dead with a bullet wound to her 
chest, hours after the attack.

According to the paper the first shot of pellets struck her in the arm and she screamed and the second and third struck her in the right side of the chest, killing her.

The weapon used in the slaying was found in the yard of her Willow Grove Road home near her body.

Tammy Palmer's family said that Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged husband, John.

The order preventing him from the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16.

She lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law.

'This morning she put the kids on the bus, I think she was hanging clothes,' said the victim’s father John Pannirello.

'He went there, I guess they had an argument. Went to get a gun, killed her.'

Eugene Palmer's sister, Elaine Babcock, said he rushed to her house straight after the slaying and admitted what he'd done.

'He just came in and said, 'Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough.

'I
shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever
you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,' and then 
he just took off,' Babcock told CBS.

The woman said she immediately called police, who believe he fled into Harriman State Park, which backs on to his property.

Search teams spent Monday hunting the woods for the man, a retired park ranger, and were using tracking dogs and helicopters to help them. 

On Tuesday they discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram pickup truck, shortly after 1pm, and remain confident he is somewhere in the park.

Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter, and are fighting to take custody of her two children.

They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight last week.

But they never thought the man would end her life.

'She told me 'Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright.' I don’t think she ever thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello told CBS.

'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said, adding 'a part of me died today.'
