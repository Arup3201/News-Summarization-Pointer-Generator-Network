Nude pictures of celebrities leaked online may have been stolen using a rudimentary hacking technique known as phishing rather than a sophisticated sting, experts believe.

Phishing scams involve tricking users into handing over passwords or personal information, often using an email which looks like it's from a legitimate company asking for details.

Banks have cautioned against such scams for years, telling customers that they will never ask for account details or passwords in email messages.

But investigators probing the celebrity leaks are now thought to be looking at the possibility that at least some of the hacked star's details may have been obtained by phishing.

Experts believe hackers may have got access to celebrity iCloud accounts using phishing, a scam which tricks  users into handing over details by sending a message appearing to be from a legitimate company

Experts believe hackers used a computer to guess the answers to stars' secret questions (below) using widely-known personal details, then used phishing attacks to get their usernames (above)

In order to bypass security on an account you usually need two things, a username and an answer to a secret question.

In the case of the celebrity leaks, experts believe hackers used a programme which cracked the stars' secret questions by making repeated guesses using personal information available online.

However, knowing the username - usually an email address associated with the account - is more difficult.

For that, hackers may have used a phishing attack to gain access to one email account, before getting the email addresses of other stars from a contact book.

Apple
 confirmed yesterday that the leaks were the result of a 'targeted 
attack on user names, passwords and security questions', otherwise known
 as a brute-force attack.

In a brute-force attack a computer programme is used to repeatedly guess at a password until it finds the right combination.

In
 this case, the celebrity status of the victims makes them much more 
vulnerable, as so much information about them, such as the names of pets
 or ex-partners, is already public knowledge.

However,
 any hacker would also have to have access to the target's user name, usually an email associated with the account, which 
is where phishing comes in.

Experts
 believe hackers must have compromised at least one of the stars' accounts, and then used this account to access other email addresses, 
which could have been stored in a contact book.

Then, using this information, the hackers could have gained access to other iCloud accounts, which might explain the large number of victims.

According
 to TMZ, FBI investigators are looking into whether Kate Upton, Mary 
Elizabeth Winstead, Jennifer Lawrence, or Lea Michele were the target of
 the phishing attack.

Today actress Denise Richards revealed that she was messaged more than ten 
times by suspected hackers asking for her iCloud password and threatening to 
shut down her accounts if she did not respond.

 Richards tweeted today that she had received over ten emails asking for
 her password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not 
respond

Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call'

'Whether
 or not iCloud was the point of compromise in this incident, scammers 
have been interested in stealing these credentials for some time,' 
explained Satnam Narang from security firm Symantec.

'These
 emails contain links to phishing websites that will capture your Apple 
ID credentials and send them back to the attackers.

Apple said 
it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and advised worried customers to 
update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step 
verification.

'Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us,' it said in a statement.

'We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities.

"In the case of celebrities, these secret questions are very easy to find
 online - either in Wikipedia or by searching through some interviews"

'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple's engineers to discover the source.'

'After
 more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain 
celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user 
names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all 
too common on the Internet.'

The news comes as Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call'.

'I think people in general just have to be cautious,' she told the BBC's Newsbeat, telling them 'I don't have an iCloud account on my phone'.

Jeffifer Lawrence and model Cara Delevingne are among those hit by the leaks so far

MailOnline 
revealed that Hackers could have gained access to celebrity iCloud 
accounts using just an email address and a search engine.

The
 system allows people to reset a password by answering two security 
questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity
 users.

Apple
 does message users to tell them their password has been changed, but if
 a hacker has access to their email account this notification can be 
deleted before they ever see it.

Rich Mogull, a security expert with Securosis, warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online.

Security consultant Graham Cluley also warned that more users could become vulnerable to attacks, as the iCloud serivce will be used to move data across to the new iPhone.
