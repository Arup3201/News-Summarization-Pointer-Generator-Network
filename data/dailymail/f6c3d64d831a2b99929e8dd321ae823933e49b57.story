Supercar owners living in an exclusive new high-rise apartment block can keep a close eye on their beloved motors thanks to a special elevator that allows them to park in their living rooms.

Hamilton Parks in Singapore is a brand-new 30-storey development where flats cost between £6 and £15million. But with parking in the city limited, the skyscraper designer came up with an innovative way of parking some of the planet's fastest cars.

Residents simply drive their 200mph 
motors into a biometrically-controlled lift at the base of Hamilton 
Parks on the city's swanky Orchard Road.

Life in the fast lane: Supercar owners in this exclusive Singaporean high-rise apartment block can admire their motors from their living rooms thanks to a special elevator

They then press their thumb on a 
sensor in the lift and the elevator transports the car to the apartment 
where it is parked in what developers call an 'en suite garage'.

Owners can then wind down after a long day's work with their supercar in full view - despite being more than 100-metres up.

Hamilton Parks, built by KOP Properties, is made up of 56 apartments and boasts swimming pools, play pools, jacuzzis and a gym.

Each apartment gets two 'en suite garages' apart from residents in the penthouse who have four.

How it works: The well-heeled owner arrives home and parks up in front of the entrance to the lift before stepping out into the lobby

Automation: The owner touches the biometric panel to confirm their identity and the lift door is raised before the car is moved into position

The car is slid into position ready to be raised to the correct floor

Floor it: The lift begins to move carrying its precious 200mph cargo

Up she rises: The building's biometrically-controlled car lift whisks a resident's beloved motor directly to their apartment

Residents simply drive their 200mph motors into the lift at the base of the block and they are 
effortlessly transported up to their apartments

Singapore is home to more Maseratis, Ferraris and Lamborghinis per capita than anywhere else in the world.

But
 customers in the wealthy South East Asian city state have to pay 
whopping taxes to import the supercars with a Ferrari 458 Italia costing
 in excess of £500,000.

Leny Suparman, chief executive of KOP Properties, said: 'These buyers are very discerning.

'They've seen a lot, so they're very exposed in the world, so they are looking for something that's unique and different.

'It's done in such a way that it's a museum showcase, it's not just a car park.

Singapore is home to more Maseratis, Ferraris and Lamborghinis per capita than anywhere else in the world but parking space is extremely limited
