A former hospital worker is facing jail after embezzling $1.5m from his employer by ordering, stealing and reselling printer toner.

Marque Gumbs ordered the office supplies while working at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, but sold the toner on to help fund his luxury lifestyle.

The receiving clerk would order unneeded printer toner on the hospital's bill before meeting the supplier on the street, reselling the product and pocketing the cash.

While carrying out the scheme, Gumbs, 33, bought a 2011 BMW, a diamond-encrusted Rolex watch and Vuitton bags.

He also lived in a luxury Â£2,250-a-month condo in New York's Trump Tower while carrying out the elaborate three-year scam and regularly took holidays to Las Vegas and the Caribbean.

Prosecutors said Gumbs ordered over $1.5m of printer toner between September 2007 and August 2010 while employed as a low-level receiving clerk.

He carried out the scam while earning just $37,800-a-year at the hospital, and would often order toner cartridges which didn't even work on the hospital campus machines.

Gumbs faces up to seven-and-a-half years jail after admitting grand larceny yesterday at Manhattan Supreme Court.

The former hospital worker had worked at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 1999, but was fired in November after his arrest.

The court heard Gumbs had password-protected access to a computer at the hospital used to order supplies from Office Depot.

After
ordering the toner, Gumbs would instruct suppliers to meet him in the 
street for delivery before the items reached the normal receiving area.

Gumbs
pleaded guilty and accepted a likely jail term of between 
two-and-a-half and seven-and-a-half years rather than go to trial and 
face a possible 25-year sentence.

He
will be sentenced in August 8 and was also ordered to return the BMW 
X6, diamond-encrusted watch and other luxury items bought through funds 
from the scheme.
