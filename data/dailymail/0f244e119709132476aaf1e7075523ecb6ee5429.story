Thousands of Britons were among those caught up in travel chaos on Monday as Air France cancelled half of its flights due to strike action.

Pilots working for the troubled airline were taking action against its plan to pour more money into its low-cost subsidiary.

The strike, which is expected to cost around £15m a day, saw huge queues building up at major airports as thousands were stranded.

Stranded passenger, businessman David Newman, from Birmingham, said: 'It's an absolutely chaotic situation - I'm desperate to get to Nice from Paris but nothing seems to be moving.

'Lots of services have been cancelled completely, but information is very hard to come by. It's a ridiculous situation.

'Air travel in France is always being hit by strikes - the country needs to sort this matter out.'

Britons are the biggest visitor group in the world to Paris, while thousands of others use France as a hub to get to other parts of the world.

Delays: Passengers are urged to postpone or cancel their travel planes as Air France pilots strike

Air France sent 65,000 text messages to passengers warning them about cancellations and delays, but thousands just turned up anyway.

A company spokesman urged those 'who have booked a flight between September 15 and 22 to delay their trip, change their ticket free of charge or claim a refund'.

'What are we meant to do, just sit at home when we're meant to be somewhere else?' said Jean-Philippe Beauchene, another stranded passenger.

'At least while you're at the airport you have a slim chance of travelling. Just giving up is not an option for most people.'

'Lack of information': Passengers wait near a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris

SNPL, the main pilots' union at Air France, warned that up to 80 per cent of flights could be cancelled as the strike continues into this week.

Air France employees fear that the development of their low-cost operator, Transavia, will lead to jobs being outsourced to other companies, and permanent jobs being reduced to part-time contracts.

Jean-Louis Barber, the head of the SNPL union, told France's AFP news agency: 'This is about a point of principle. We're not even talking about a rise in wages.

Mr Barber added: 'If the strike continues beyond September 15, the flight schedule will be modified as a result. The knock-on effects will be communicated to passengers the day before they are due to leave.'

In response to the strike, British company easyJet on Saturday laid on 1,000 extra seats on flights from Paris to Toulouse and Nice.
