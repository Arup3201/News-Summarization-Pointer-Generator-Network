A Maverick Twitter user who flew into the danger zone by trying to tweet every shot of the movie Top Gun has had their account suspended.

Before the movie fan's mission could be completed Paramount Pictures, which made the iconic 1986 action film, sent in its lawyers.

Frames from the movie started being posted on Twitter on January 23, and had just reached the point where Tom Cruise's character Maverick serenades Charlie, who was played by McGillis.

Mission: A fan of the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun has been stopped from posting every frame of the film

Before the account was shut down, it had attracted more than 6,800 followers who were sent two tweeted frames and quotes every hour.

The tweets were posted under the user name @555uhz, believed to be a reference to the number of frames a second the film was being shown at on Twitter.

'The real framerate is the rate at which the account posts frames to Twitter, just like the real framerate in a movie is the rate at which a spool of film projects images onto a screen,' according to Vice.

It is estimated that the film would have been tweeted in 7,000 images, with two posted every hour, meaning it would have taken followers 145 days to see the entire movie.

However, the Twitter account was suspended, with the last frame being posted on February 25, after Paramount threatened legal action.

Lawyers for the studio filed a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notice stating: 'No one is authorized to copy, reproduce,
 distribute, or otherwise use Top Gun without the express written 
permission of Paramount.'
