Inconsistent: Even the man the university is named after - the 19th-century Mormon church president Brigham Young - wore a thick chinstrap beard

Students at Brigham Young University have launched a bid to overturn a decades-old ban on students at the Mormon school having beards.

Despite having a campus full of otherwise fashion-conscious young men, the only facial hair on display at the university in the city of Provo, Utah is the occasional neatly-trimmed moustache.

The world famous university banned chin hair in the mid-1970s in an effort to distance its strait-laced student body from the more-often-than-not bearded and long haired activists staging anti-war protests at other centres of education in the United States.

But now, with beards having gone from being the ultimate symbol of non-conformism to a ubiquitous fashion trend, students at Brigham Young are urging university officials to lift the ban so that they can join the likes of Ryan Gosling and Ben Affleck in rocking the facial fuzz. 

Shane Pitson, 23, is among the group of reluctantly clean-shaven students leading the campaign to have the Brigham Young beard ban overturned.

'We want the option and ability to express personality through facial hair,' he told the New York Times adding that being Mormons doesn't necessarily mean students aren't interested in fashion.

He also pointed out the irony of naming the famously conservative university after the 19th-century Mormon church president Brigham Young, who himself wore a thick chinstrap beard.

Mr Pitson's campaign began in September after he was forced to shave off the facial appendage he had grown over the summer and has since been enthusiastically taken up by his fellow students.

He even launched a website calling for the return of the beard, going so far as to pen a tongue-in-cheek letter written in the beard's voice.

'I know you didn't appreciate me hanging out with "the wrong crowd" and protesting the Vietnam War and all but I was honestly so hurt when you banned my presence,' he lamented, pretending to be a beard. 

Brigham Young University was founded in 1875 and for its first 100 years beards were a common sight

Campaign: With the rise of student activism in the 1960s, Brigham Young University's president, Ernest L. Wilkinson led a campaign to keep the school free of 'grimy, sandalled, tight-fitted, ragged-Levi beatniks'

Brigham Young University was founded in 1875 and for the first century of its existence beards were a regular sight - so much so that male students held an annual competition in which they declined to shave for three weeks, with prizes given out to those with the most impressive growths.

However, with the rise of student activism in the 1960s, the school's president, Ernest L. Wilkinson led a campaign to keep the university free of 'grimy, sandalled, tight-fitted, ragged-Levi beatniks.'

By the mid-1970s his ideals had been written into the school's rulebook - banning beards along with a host of other fashion items deemed too subversive for conservative campus life.

The only people currently allowed to wear beards on campus are individuals who can prove that shaving could cause medical problems - such as haemophiliacs or those prone to serious infections. 

The ban itself does not bar students from walking around the campus, but university staff are instructed not to allow them to take advantage of the basic necessities of student life - such as withdrawing library books, using the gym or entering classrooms or exam halls.
