Swansea City forwards Bafetimbi Gomis and Marvin Emnes took some time out for a walk around Liverpool before their Capital One Cup clash in the city on Tuesday.

Gomis, who could start at Anfield on Tuesday evening, tweeted a picture of the two strikers looking relaxed on the morning of the game.

And the French striker, who scored his only Swansea goal to date in the previous round of the competition, will be hoping to be on the scoresheet again as Garry Monk seeks to upset his former manager Brendan Rodgers.

Gomis' appearances this season have been limited, but he will hope to make an impact against Liverpool

Emnes will also be hoping for some game time, having not made an appearance for the Swans in over a month. The dutch striker scored his only goal of the season in the third round of the competition against Everton.

Liverpool will be looking to bounce back from disappointing results against Hull City and Real Madrid in their previous two games, and are expected to field a strong side.

However it is still not clear whether Mario Balotelli, who missed his side's best chance on the weekend and has been widely criticised, will play.
