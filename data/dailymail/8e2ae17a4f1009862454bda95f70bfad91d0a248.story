Tomasz Grzonka left his baby outside a priest's home at the Polish Catholic Centre in London Road, Reading, Berkshire, on a 'chilly' night last year, a judge was told

A father abandoned his two-week-old daughter in a bag on a priest's doorstep along with a note asking him for a 'huge favour', a court has heard.

The father, along with the girl's mother, placed the child into a black holdall bag along with a silver chain blessed by the Pope and a note.

Tomasz Grzonka then left her outside the priest's home at the Polish Catholic Centre in London Road, Reading, Berkshire, on a 'chilly' night last year, a judge was told.

He claimed he and his girlfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, abandoned the infant as the couple believed they could get into trouble after choosing to have a home birth.

The 27-year-old, who worked on his parents' rural Polish farm before coming to Britain in 2008, admitted child cruelty after leaving the infant in the bag on a cool night last May.

Daniel Fugallo, prosecuting, said the couple had left the little girl - who also cannot be named for legal reasons - in a bag on the doorstep of the home of Father Edward Stachurski.

Mr Fugallo told the court: 'On May 3 last year, at about a quarter to eight at night, he [Father Stachurski] left his home to visit a friend in hospital at the nearby Royal Berkshire Hospital.

'He noted it was a chilly evening.

'He left at 7.45pm and returned at about 9pm and saw, at the top of the steps leading up to his front door, a black sports holdall zipped-up almost completely.

'From inside the bag, Father Edward heard the sound of a baby crying softly.

'He opened it, looked inside and saw a small infant. He took the bag inside and the police were called.

'Inside the bag they found, next to the baby, a baby's bottle, two clean nappies, a dummy, a scarf, a towel, a silver chain and a note in Polish.'

The note began 'Blessed be the Lord' and asked the priest for a 'huge favour', requesting he first take the fortnight-old baby to hospital for a check-up before seeing to it that the little girl was brought up by a Polish family.

The note added: 'I need to act like this because I am unable to provide dignified conditions for her.

'I am enclosing a neck chain with this letter and ask you to get the future parents to pass it onto her.

'It has been blessed by the Pope.'

Paramedics took the girl to hospital and she was examined and found to be fine.

A police appeal for information saw the mother's family in Poland contact authorities to say they suspected she may be involved after they recognised the holdall the infant was found in.

On May 9 last year police visited the three-bedroom cottage the couple lived in, rent-free, at the dairy farm where Grzonka worked as a £22,000 pounds-a-year farmhand in Hampshire.

Both were arrested and the little girl's mother began crying and asked after the welfare of her daughter, said Mr Fugallo.

The court heard that the pair - who met on the internet in June 2011 before the woman joined Grzonka in the UK the following month - had £6,000 pounds in bank savings as well as wads of cash in sterling, Euros and US dollars.

Grzonka told police at interview his partner had given birth at home on April 19 and the pair had later read on the internet that such practice was illegal in the UK.

Fearing their daughter may be taken away from them, they decided to abandon her instead.

About a week before they finally left the girl, the couple had made an abortive attempt to carry out their plan, deciding against going through with it at the last minute as there were several drunks in the area.

Describing the events of May 3, Mr Fugallo said: 'They drove to Reading in Mr Grzonka's car with their daughter in the bag on the back seat.'

After they arrived Grzonka walked up to the house and, seeing the lights on and cars parked outside, believed the priest would be at home.

At 8.24pm, Mr Fugallo said, the baby's mother walked alone to the door with the bag and put her daughter down before ringing the buzzer and then returning to the car.

The couple then drove away and it was around 30 minutes before the little girl was found.

Neil Griffin, defending, said the 'unusual' case was a result of the two parents being 'unable to cope' in a strange environment far away from home.

The little girl had been very well cared for and was wrapped up warm on the night she was found, he said.

'No harm was caused to the child as a result of the very short exposure.

'This is a very different case to other cases of abandonment or cruelty,' added Mr Griffin.

Grzonka, who trained in animal husbandry in Poland before studying at the Institute for Animal Health in Britain, was a hardworking individual who wanted to support his family and was now allowed to have supervised contact with his daughter.

Mr Griffin said: 'He has, through his guilty plea, shown remorse for what he did that fateful evening.'

Grzonka currently earns £400 pounds a month and lives in a caravan with other agricultural labourers in Staffordshire, the court heard.

Wearing a grey suit over a blue shirt and grey tie, he sat alongside a female Polish interpreter in the dock.

The defendant had admitted a single count of child cruelty at an earlier hearing.

Sentencing him to a 16-week jail term, suspended for a year, Judge Ian Grainger described the case as 'unusual and difficult' but said Grzonka's actions represented an 'enormous and unwarranted risk.'

The little girl was 'utterly defenceless,' said the judge, who added: 'This was attempted permanent abandonment.'

The motivations for the abandonment were 'obscure,' he said.

'In short, this was clearly abandonment that had been planned and reflected on, however immaturely.'

A formal not guilty verdict was recorded against the child's teenage mother at an earlier hearing when prosecutors offered no evidence against her on the same count.

The blonde, wearing a black dress, was in court to support her partner and clasped his hand as he walked free from the dock.
