After more than a decade as a judge on reality singing competition American Idol, Randy Jackson is quitting the show.

The longtime judge confirmed his departure to E! News on Thursday, stating:

'Yo! Yo! Yo! To put all of the speculation to the rest, after 12 years of judging on American Idol I have decided it is time to leave after this season,' he said.

'Life-changing': Randy, pictured in LA in 2012, said he was 'very proud' of having been a part of the show

'I am very proud of how we forever changed television and the music industry,' said Jackson. 'It's been a life changing opportunity but I am looking forward to focusing on my company Dream Merchant 21 and other business ventures.'

Idol has seen a steady rotation of judges in recent years, but Jackson is the only original judge to have stayed the course with the series.

'There's always been chaos with American Idol, but this year it's been more than ever,' a source told E!.

His
exit comes amid rumours that none of the current judges will be invited
to return for the upcoming season, and the show's format will be 
completely redesigned as Fox scrambles to regain its position as 
television's highest-rated show.

'All four are gone,' an insider with knowledge of Fox's plans told website The Wrap. 'They feel they've lost their core audience and they want it back.'

The
judging panel is currently made up of pop singer Mariah Carey, rapper 
Nicki Minaj, country crooner Keith Urban and original judge Randy 
Jackson.

All four have options to return for the next season, but Fox won't be renewing any of their contracts.

When Minaj was asked by Ryan Seacrest on Thursday whether the rumours were true, the rapper answered somewhat cryptically.

'That's a million-dollar question… I have to say this all the time, but
I want people to know it's genuinely from my heart. I love the people on Idol.
I genuinely do,' she told the radio presenter and Idol presenter.

'If I had to do this all over again, I would have done Idol.
Because it's fun, it's laughs. It's kind of sad that what people read all the
time is only when something is negative. But they don't realise that we built a
family, she added.

She then expressed her gratitude to the producers for putting her on the show.

'I feel happy here and I have to thank them for giving me this chance. They
could have picked anyone in the world. And they picked me. So that's all I'll
say about that,' she said.

The network also plans to stop paying its famously huge salaries to attract big name judges (Carey received a whopping $18 million, and Minaj $12 million).

'No more big checks for divas,' the source told The Wrap.

Despite recent reports, Fox also isn't thinking of bringing former judge Jennifer Lopez back onboard to save the flailing show.

Fox Broadcasting chairman Kevin 
Reilly has been tasked with 'fixing Idol,' said the source, and he plans
to revamp the show's format.

It will be completely redesigned and the tribute nights will be done away with.

Longtime producer Nigel Lythgoe, who has been with the show from the beginning, is also expected to be replaced.

The 10-year-old Fox show has seen its popularity wane in recent years.

Idol
also dropped 15 percent among the 18- to 49-year-old demographic 
attractive to advertisers, according to the New York Daily News.

In
another bad sign, the coveted adult audience last month turned into a 
couple of repeats of The Big Bang Theory more than an original airing on
Thursday of American Idol, according to a report in Entertainment 
Weekly.

The Fox singing show peaked in 2006's season five when Taylor Hicks was named American Idol and the season finale drew a whopping 36.4 million viewers.

Other contestants that season included Katharine McPhee, Kellie Pickler and Chris Daughtry. It remains the most productive season in terms of generating recording artists.

American Idol recently has been struggling against other competition shows and this season may  relinquish its crown as the most popular show of its genre.

Two same-week editions of NBC's The Voice and ABC's Dancing With The Stars last month drew larger audiences than Idol.

The show enjoyed its most success with its original panel of three judges that included the acerbic Simon Cowell, pop singer Paula Abdul and music manager Randy Jackson.
