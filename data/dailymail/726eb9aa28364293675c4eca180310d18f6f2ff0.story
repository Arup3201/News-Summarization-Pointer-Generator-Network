Aggressive: James Browning 'was jumping up and down like Tarzan, ripping his shirt off and spoiling for a fight,' a court heard

A drunk stockbroker said to be as wild as Tarzan headbutted a taxi driver and slammed his head in his cab door after dodging a fare.

James Browning, 26, bragged he had been ‘on charlie’ – a slang word for cocaine – shortly before attacking Dean Wendleken.

But when he appeared in court the associate at the London Metal Exchange, denied being high on the Class A drug.

Instead he claimed he was simply drunk after downing five pints and two vodka cocktails during an afternoon drinking session.

Mr Wendleken, 49, needed 16 stitches for cuts to his face following the attack in London in April.

Browning had hailed his taxi at 3am in Stratford and had asked to be taken to an address behind the Tate Modern.

Christian Wheeliker, prosecuting, said Mr Wendleken asked Browning if he had ‘had a good night’ and the defendant replied: ‘No. I’ve had a c*** night. I always do when my friends get me on charlie.’

Camberwell Green magistrates heard that Browning went to an ATM to get cash for the £24.80 fare but returned empty handed saying he had lost his wallet. He then ran away.

Mr Wendleken caught up with him, asked for his details and told Browning he could pay him the next day. The stockbroker, the court heard, then told him ‘I ain’t giving you f*** all’, before headbutting him.

Assault: The young City broker headbutted a taxi driver before slamming his head in the cab's door - inflicting wounds that needed a total of sixteen stitches

In trouble: Browning had been drinking and had allegedly bragged about taking cocaine before he ran off without paying his cab fare

Mr Wheeliker said Browning followed Mr  Wendleken back to his cab where he slammed the  cabbie’s head in his door.

Mr Wheeliker said: ‘In the words of 
the driver Browning was jumping up and down like Tarzan, ripping his 
shirt off and spoiling for a fight.’

In a victim impact statement, Mr 
Wendleken said he was ‘apprehensive’ about returning to work, but had 
‘learned to cope’ with what had happened.

John Verdon, chairman of the bench said  Browning was lucky not to be jailed for the ‘nasty offence’. 
Browning, who admitted one count of assault, was sentenced to 240 hours 
of community service and ordered to pay £725 compensation.
