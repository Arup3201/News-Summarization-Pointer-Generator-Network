A grandmother had a lucky escape after she crashed into a car wash after she mistook it for a supermarket exit.

The elderly woman miraculously walked from the wreckage without any injuries despite having her car curshed by the car wash on Saturday morning.

The pensioner - who has not been named - had just finished shopping at Sainsbury’s in Rugby, Warwickshire, at around 11am when she tried to drive out of the car park.

Close call: Remarkably, the bemused OAP, believed to be in her 70s, stumbled from the wreckage without any injuries

But she ploughed into the frame of the car wash, which she thought was the way out of the supermarket.

The frame then came crashing down on her white Peugeot 406 causing thousands of pounds of damage.

Remarkably, the bemused OAP, believed to be in her 70s, stumbled from the wreckage without any injuries and even joked to staff who ran to her aid.

She quipped ‘my grandkids won’t let me live this down’ as shocked onlookers rushed to help.

Dangerous: One supermarket worker explained that there was around two tonnes of metal on top of the car, so she was very lucky to be unhurt

A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: ‘We’re delighted that the customer was unharmed and in good spirits after the accident.

‘Our car wash will remain closed while we make repairs and we hope to see the customer in store again soon.’

On Tuesday, one worker at the store, who did not wish to be named, added: ‘There’s two tons of metal in that car wash so she had a very lucky escape.

‘She was quite jovial about it - and joked to staff that she thought it was the way out.

‘She said "my grandchildren won’t let me live this down".

‘She took it all in her stride really, she seemed a really sweet old dear.’

The incident was not reported to Warwickshire Police and West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed they were not required at the scene.
