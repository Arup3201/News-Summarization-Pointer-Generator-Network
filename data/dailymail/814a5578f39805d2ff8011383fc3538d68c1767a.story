Despite appearances to the contrary, Uruguay actually have two centre forwards capable of troubling England in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

Roy Hodgson and his players have every reason to fear Liverpool’s Luis Suarez when the teams meet in their second match in Group D. Certainly Suarez’s recovery from recent knee surgery is fundamental to the South Americans’ chances here. 

However, playing up front when Uruguay begin their World Cup in Fortaleza against Costa Rica on Saturday afternoon will be Paris Saint-Germain’s formidable goalscorer Edinson Cavani - and the 27-year-old has admitted that he is driven on by his rivalry with Suarez.

Menace: Uruguay frontman Edinson Cavani admits he is driven by his rivalry with team-mate Luis Suarez

‘We certainly have our own little rivalry to spur each other on and help our country perform at its best,’ said Cavani.

‘We want to be in the best condition possible to help our country. It’s a dream we both share.‘In the past four years we’ve improved and matured as a partnership. We’ve both done very good things this season. We’ve been working hard for a long time to achieve our objectives for Uruguay.

Connection: Cavani and Suarez's fathers played in the same local leagye in the north-west of Uruguay

‘We
 hope that can continue this summer because we want to do well for our 
country, for our people, and to keep our position as one of the highest 
ranked teams in the world. Luis has been phenomenal this season.’

Born
 in the same month in the north-western town of Salto, Suarez and Cavani
 never knew each other as children, even though their fathers played in 
the same local league. Over the next month, though, it’s hard to escape 
the sense that they must present the best side of their partnership if 
they are to progress from a group that also contains Italy.

‘No, we didn’t know each other as children, but our fathers did,’ explained Cavani. 

‘They actually played football together in Salto’s local leagues when they were younger, before me and Luis were born. Luis left for the capital, Montevideo, to play football when he was very small, so our paths didn’t cross on the pitch until we were playing in Uruguay’s youth teams. 

‘We’re both boys from Salto, though, and we know every nook and cranny of the place. We’ve grown up with those customs and habits and it’s a big part of who we are.’ 

Cavani first came to Europe’s attention as a buccaneering striker for Napoli in Serie A. Manchester City tracked him closely before he moved to France with PSG last summer. 

More recently, Manchester United considered a bid for him, though that interest has cooled a little under new Old Trafford manager Louis van Gaal.

With England’s central defensive partnership of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka arguably the weakest  part of their line-up, it is possible Uruguay may leave Suarez out of Saturday night’s game to protect his knee ahead of next week’s second Group D match.

‘This is a tough group, absolutely,’ said Cavani, who has scored  21 times in 62 international appearances.

‘But you’d expect that from a World Cup. It will be both difficult and beautiful at the same time, because if you can compete with the best in the world and challenge them for the Golden Boot — not necessarily even winning it - then that’s a very attractive proposition.

‘To win a World Cup you have to maintain a level of concentration whereby you face the best teams in the world by playing to your maximum.

‘We know our first three games are going to be elite, top. The  competition is going to be fierce from the beginning, but that only makes it more beautiful to play in this tournament, because you have to bring your best face as early as possible.’
