When she looks back at photos of herself dressed up in costumes and cutting birthday cakes, Jessica Masuglia admits she had a 'pretty happy' childhood.

But under the surface it was a little more complicated.

The 24-year-old from Melbourne was raised by her heroin-addicted mother.

Her mum, Kim Mackenzie, died from an overdose a few years ago when she was just 43. Sadly, it was a week after her daughter's 21st birthday.

Jessica Masuglia was raised in her Melbourne home by her mum Kim Mackenzie. Despite her mother' heroin addiction, Ms Masuglia says her upbringing was happy

'Even though my mum was a heroin addict, she was a great mum,' Ms Masuglia told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Masuglia, now 24, said she hid her mother's addiction from almost everyone growing up but has now decided to share her story

'My mum was amazing, she had a lot of love. She was very hands on and she would do anything to make me happy.'

Her mother was in and out of sobriety for most of Ms Masuglia's life.

While she knew her mum was different to others, Ms Masuglia was oblivious to the heroin abuse until she was older.

'For a lot of my young she was straight. She would fall into periods of a few weeks where she'd use. Then she would stop. Six months later she'd start again,' she said.

'She was two different people.

'She overdosed once and had to be brought back to life. I didn't see any of that. I never witnessed her taking drugs, I think she was trying to protect me.'

Ms Masuglia said her relationship with her mum only became strained when she was a teenager and she developed drug psychosis because of her addiction, which by then included alcoholism.

'It was really hard. She had mood swings and she'd snap at me. It really hurt to see her this addiction and us arguing all the time,' she said.

She and her mum went their separate ways when Ms Masuglia was 16 and they hadn't seen each other for four years when Ms MacKenzie died

She and her mum went their separate ways when Ms Masuglia was 16. She moved away from the family home her mum and dad lived in to stay with her aunt.

They hadn't seen each other for four years when Ms MacKenzie died.

'I had been expecting it for a couple of years but it was really tough when it happened. I didn't really know what to feel. It was the first time I'd lost someone that close to me,' Ms Masuglia said.

'Guilt was probably the main thing I felt because I hadn't seen her. I felt partially to blame, especially because when we stopped seeing each other because that's when she really went downhill.

'There was times when I didn’t think she was a good mum because I was hurting. Especially when she passed away, but looking back I realise how much she loved me.'

Her mother was in and out of sobriety for most of Ms Masuglia's life - she was addicted to heroin and pills and later turned to alcohol too

Ms Masuglia said she hid her mother's addiction from almost everyone growing up.

But she decided it was time to share her experience when talk of the government drug testing dole recipients became a controversial talking point.

'It sort of irks me a bit when people say drug users waste their dole money on drugs,' she said.

'My mum was on the dole and that money fed me and it put a roof over my head. The money wasn’t all put to towards drugs and it’s not always the case.

'Drug addiction and mental health are both still stigmatised in society because people just don't understand it. I don't think they'll ever understand it until they love someone with an addiction.
