Tragic: Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys died this morning at the age of 47

Beastie Boys rapper Adam Yauch has died at 47.

The hip hop star, also known as MCA, passed away this morning after a long battle with cancer.

He is survived by his wife Dechen and his 14-year-old daughter, Tenzin Losel Yauch.

His publicist released a statement confirming the news this afternoon which read: 'It is with great sadness that we confirm that musician, rapper, activist and director Adam 'MCA' Yauch ... passed away in his native New York City this morning after a near-three-year battle with cancer.'

Yauch revealed in 2009 that he was undergoing surgery and radiation therapy to treat a tumor in his salivary gland.

At the time, Yauch expressed hope it was 'very treatable.'

Yauch, a practising Buddhist and activist who worked to raise awareness on the plight of the Tibetan people, also turned to a vegan diet and eastern medicine.

Last year he denied reports he had beaten the disease, but said he was 'staying optimistic and hoping to be cancer free in the near future.'

His illness caused the group to cancel shows and delayed the release of their 2011 album, Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 2.

He hadn't performed in public since 2009
and was absent when the Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame in April.

His band mates Michael Diamond (Mike D) with Adam Horovitz (Ad Rock) read a letter on his behalf.

It said:
'I’d like to dedicate this to my brothers Adam and Mike.They walked the
globe with me. It’s also for anyone who has ever been touched by our 
band. This induction is as much ours as it is yours.'

The
Brooklyn-born Yauch created the Beastie Boys with high school friend 
Mike D.

They went on sell over 40 million records and release four No. 1
albums.

Tributes rolled in for Yauch today including a message of condolence from the Dalai Lama, who met with him several times, most recently in July.

Originally conceived as a hardcore punk group, it soon became a hip-hop trio after Ad-Rock.

They released their chart-topping 
debut Licensed to Ill in 1986, a raucous album led by the anthem (You 
Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).

But in the seven studio albums that followed, the Beastie Boys expanded considerably and grew more musically ambitious.

Their follow-up, 1989's Paul's Boutique, ended any suggestion of the group as a one-hit wonder.

Extensive in its sampling and 
sonically layered, the album was ranked the 156th greatest album ever by
Rolling Stone magazine in 2003.

The Beastie Boys would later take up 
their own instruments - a rarity in hip-hop - on the album Check Your 
Head and subsequent releases.

The Beastie Boys - a trio of white 
Jewish kids - established themselves as one of the most respected groups
in hip-hop at a time when white rappers were few.

Introducing the group at the Rock Hall, Public Enemy rapper Chuck D said the Beastie Boys 'broke the mold.'

'The Beastie Boys are indeed three bad brothers who made history,' said Chuck D.

'They brought a whole new look to rap and hip-hop. They proved that rap could come from any street - not just a few.'

Yauch also went under the pseudonym Nathanial Hornblower when working as a filmmaker.

He directed numerous videos for the 
group including So Whatcha Want,” ”Intergalactic,” “Body Movin” and 
“Ch-Check It Out.”, as well as the 2006 concert film Awesome: I F--- 
Shot That!.

He also co-founded the film distribution company Osciolloscope Laboratories, named after his New York studio.

The company's credits include We Need to Talk About 
Kevin, Wendy and Lucy and the Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift 
Shop.

Yauch founded Milarepa Fund, a non-profit organization which promotes Tibetan independence.  In 1996, Milarepa produced the first Tibetan Freedom 
Concert in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, which was attended by 
100,000 people.

After September 11, Milarepa organized New Yorkers 
Against Violence, a benefit headlined by Beastie Boys in New York, with the proceeds going to to the New York 
Women’s Foundation Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Association for
New Americans September 11 Fund for New Americans.

Yauch met his wife Dechen Wangdu, an American-born daughter of prominent Tibetan activists, in 1995 when they both attended a speech by the Dalai Lama at Harvard University.

At the time, Yauch was struggling with the direction of his life, telling Rolling Stone: 'I was debating between the idea of being a celibate and becoming a monk or actually having family. I was deciding whether or not I wanted to try being in a serious relationship or just stay on my own.

'Dechen and I started spending some time together and hanging out, it just felt like it would be great to have a family. That would be the right thing to do.'

They married on May 31, 1998, in New York in a traditional Tibetan wedding ceremony.

Rapper Russell Simmons' website GlobalGrind was the first to report the news. Simmons' Def Jam label released the Beastie Boys' first album, Licensed to Ill.
