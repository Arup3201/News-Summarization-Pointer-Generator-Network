A judge has dismissed assault charges against the fianc√©e of a man accused of beating his seven-year-old son to death on Father's Day three years ago.

Tiffany Hyman, 31, failed to intervene when Leslie Schuler allegedly inflicted a fatal attack on his son at home in Worcester, Massachusetts, in June 2009, prosecutors claim.

She is still awaiting trial on charges of reckless endangerment and being an accessory after the fact.

But a Superior Court Judge Richard T. Tucker last week ruled there is insufficient evidence to pursue assault charges against her.

The boy, Nathaniel Turner, had come to Worcester from his home in Eufaula, Alabama, about a month before his death to spend the summer with his father.

Schuler, 39, is accused of repeatedly beating Nathaniel, culminating in a brutal assault when he is alleged to have slammed the boy's head into a wall so hard it left a dent.

Victim: Nathaniel Turner was seven when he was killed in 2009

The boy was declared brain dead two days later.

Schuler was originally charged with multiple counts of assault, but a murder charge was added when Nathaniel died after being removed from a hospital ventilator.

The child had lived with his grandmother most of his life in Alabama. Both her and Nathaniel's mother have said Schuler pleaded with them to be a part of his son's life.

Police have said Schuler told Nathaniel's family he hit his son to discipline him.

Hyman is not thought to have struck the boy but could have intervened and stopped the abuse, detectives said.

Schuler is charged with murder; two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury; assault and battery on a child causing injury; three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon; two counts of assault and battery; and a single count of reckless endangerment of a child. He denies the charges.

Hyman has pleaded not guilty to charges of permitting an assault and battery on a child causing substantial injury; reckless endangerment of a child; and being an accessory, after the fact, to assault and battery on a child causing substantial injury.

A trial date has not been set.
