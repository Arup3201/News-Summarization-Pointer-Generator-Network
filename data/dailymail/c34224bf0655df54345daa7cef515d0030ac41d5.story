Destruction: Several other people were injured, including a two-year-old child in one of the other vehicles

Passengers in the other vehicles involved in the crash, including a two-year-old, were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

The accident occurred after a Texas Highway patrol sergeant engaged in a high-speed pursuit of stolen truck on Monday afternoon, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.

Ramirez allegedly fled the scene in the stolen pickup after the crash, but was soon caught by the sergeant and taken to a local hospital, according to the DPS.

Soleto said the truck had been reported stolen more than a week ago. He did not know how fast the car was driving when it collided with the other cars in the roadway.

The crash occurred less than ten miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.

Border patrol agents responded to the accident, they were not involved in the chase, Soleto said.

'It's a whole family that just died. And just that little survivor. His parents dead, his sister dead. Everyone.'
