The former flatmate and chauffeur of Jimmy Savile has been arrested over new allegations of historic sex abuse against children.

Former DJ Ray Teret, 71, was arrested when he answered bail in relation to a separate set of allegations.

Teret, a friend of disgraced TV presenter Savile, was arrested and bailed in November last year with another man on suspicion of historic rape following an investigation into three separate claims of sexual abuse.

Police have emphasised the allegations are not linked to the national inquiry into abuse by disgraced TV presenter Savile

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'A 71-year-old man was re-arrested in connection with historic sexual offences against children when he answered his bail on Wednesday, October 23.

'He was also further arrested in connection with a number of other historic sex offences against children.

'He remains in police custody for questioning.'

Teret was arrested and bailed over the alleged rapes last November after police raided his home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester.

Another man, 61, was also arrested on suspicion of raping one of the alleged victims.

The allegations date from 1962 to 1979 and are said to have taken place in the Sale and Altrincham areas of Greater Manchester.

Police have stressed none of allegations against Teret are connected to the national inquiry into abuse by Savile, who was neither present or involved.

Former pirate radio DJ Teret was known as Savile’s sidekick when they worked together at the Plaza Ballroom in Manchester.

He was known as ‘Ugly Ray’ and Savile was so close to Teret he referred to him as ‘my son’.
