The recreation of one of the most famous moments from the First World War by Sainsbury's in its 2014 Christmas advert was branded both 'cynical' and 'wonderful' today.

Britain's third biggest supermarket said the commercial is a 'creative interpretation' of Christmas Day 1914 when British and German soldiers laid down their weapons and met in no man's land.

Sainsbury's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket's 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign. 

While some called it moving and brilliant others were saying it was an 'exploitative' way for a big business to advertise itself.

The founders of clothing company Holroyd and Pickles tweeted: 'How do you think my great great grandfather would feel knowing his bravery had been reduced to advertising Sainsbury's?'

Juliette AdAstra added her concerns, saying: 'If there's anything more tasteless and cynical than the Sainsbury's Christmas advert, I've yet to see it'.

But Lydia Hamilton tweeted: 'The Sainsbury's Christmas advert is amazing, 10 times better than John Lewis' and Sam Carvalho wrote: 'Just saw the Sainsbury’s Christmas advert. That is definitely the best advert so far'. 

Magic moment: A British and a German soldier meet in No Man's Land on Christmas Day in the new Sainsbury's advert unveiled last night

Main characters: With fears soldiers may shoot them, the two men risk their lives to climb out of the trenches and meet each other

Special: The story of the German and British soldiers enjoying a game of football during the First World War has been spoken about ever since 

The ad follows a British soldier as he hears enemy troops singing Silent Night in German and ventures into 'no man's land' before soldiers from both sides join him and shake hands.

He shares a moment of friendship with a young German soldier and, as the truce ends and they return to their trenches, the German is moved to discover that his British friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket - linked the supermarket's message of 'sharing' at Christmas.

Shoppers can help to raise extra money for the Royal British Legion after Armistice Day this year by buying the chocolate bar featured in the advert from Sainsbury's stores, with the profits going to charity.

The advert is Sainsbury's attempt to take on the might of John Lewis, which has dominated the multi-million pound battle to win over Christmas shoppers.

John Lewis has this year concentrated on the heart-warming friendship between a little boy and a penguin and its rivals are spending millions of pounds trying to outdo.

Despite costing £95 the stuffed toy versions of the penguins in the advert sold out within hours online - but on Twitter today some said that the new Sainsbury's advert is as good, if not better. 

Ally Hunter Blair said: 'Sorry to the Penguin but @sainsburys have knocked the socks off the Christmas Advert competition!'  

Beginning: The four minute advert feels more like a short film as a camera sweeps over the trenches on Christmas night

Scene: The advert starts with soldiers singing Silent Night in their respective languages as snow falls on the trenches

Drama: The young Briton is deep in thought and then, to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades, decided to climb above ground

Spark: The men shaking hands leads to other troops also climbing out of the trenches to meet their foes

Greeting: The soldiers shake hands and even hug in the heartwarming advert released today and shown for the first time last night 

Downing weapons: German and British officers stand shoulder to shoulder in the brief moment of peace before they returned to fighting

Friends: The men try to communicate in their different languages and the Brit shows his German counterpart a picture of his love at home

Gift: The German is moved to discover that his British friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket

Message: Sainsbury's is using a similar sentiment used by John Lewis that Christmas is about sharing and giving

With less than seven weeks to go most of the UK’s consumer giants have already launched their annual festive advertising campaigns. And by now, we know what that means. Between today and December 25, television viewers will be subjected to a barrage of elaborate feel-good adverts.

Marks & Spencer shunned their previous formula of using celebrities, replacing them pair of do-gooding magic fairies. Waitrose' advert is about a shy girl baking gingerbread and an exhausted nurse coming home after finishing her Christmas shift is what Boots has concentrated on.

The Sainsbury's tribute advert follows the exhibition of thousands of ceramic poppies in the moat of the Tower of London to commemorate 100 years since the start of the Great War, which has drawn millions of visitors.

Charles Byrne, director of fundraising for the Royal British Legion, said: 'We're very proud of our 20-year partnership with Sainsbury's and this campaign is particularly important.

'One hundred years on from the 1914 Christmas truce, the campaign remembers the fallen, while helping to raise vital funds to support the future of living.'

Mark Given, head of brand communications at Sainsbury's, said: 'This year, we wanted to reflect that theme of sharing in our Christmas campaign through the lens of one of the most extraordinary moments of sharing in modern history when, on Christmas Day 1914, British and German soldiers laid down their arms, and came together on neutral territory to share stories, mementoes and even a game of football. 

“The Christmas truce is an especially poignant story from First World War that has been recreated on a number of occasions and we know it resonates with many of our customers and colleagues. We’ve partnered with The Royal British Legion to ensure we tell this story with authenticity and respect and we hope it will help keep alive the memory of the fallen that made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country. 

'It is also a way for us to mark the 20th anniversary of our partnership with The Royal British Legion and to help us raise additional funds for them.'

The letter of a British soldier to his family corroborate claims enemy forces enjoyed a game of football on Christmas Day, a historian who advised Sainsbury's on its controversial advert has claimed. 

Taff Gillingham said he was 'sceptical' about helping the supermarket reconstruct scenes from the trenches for its festive commercial, fearing there was not enough evidence to prove soldiers laid down their weapons to wish each other a happy Christmas 100 years ago. 

His mind was changed however by a 1915 newspaper article which quoted letters from a British soldier to his family, describing the moment each side 'finished up kicking a football between the firing lines'. 

'At first I was very sceptical about it. Football has hijacked the truce over the past few years,' Mr Gillingham said. 

'There is a danger that all of the true history is going to be lost because people think it was nothing more than a big game of football.'

The historian had previously come across an account by Sergeant Frank Naden of the 6th Cheshires describing a game of football against German soldiers in Wulverghem, Belgium, but had never found anything to support his version of events. 

But an article from the Lynn Advertiser in January 1915 revealed a letter, written by Corporal A. Wyatt, of the 1st Norfolks, who fought alongside the Cheshires, in which the very same account is given. 

In his letter home, the soldier wrote: 'We finished up in the same old way, kicking a football between the two firing lines. So football in the firing line between the British and the Germans is the truth, as I was one that played.' 

The letter, said Mr Gillingham, was enough to convince him of the story portrayed in the emotive advert. 

'In all the years that I have been doing stuff about the truce I have never come across this account by Corporal Wyatt. 

'There are several accounts of people who claim to have played football but a lot of them don't stack up. Just by complete fluke it just happened to arrive just at the right moment so we could actually corroborate it. 

'So we could say, hand on heart, there was actually a game that the Norfolks and Cheshires played in. 

'I was really chuffed with it because it is something I had looked for for years.' 

'I knew quite a lot of First World War veterans and they would have been more than happy with it.'   

Look familiar? Paul McCartney fans say Sainsbury's Christmas ad is a rip-off of his 1983 pop video 

Paul McCartney fans said today the new Sainsbury's Christmas advert enjoys a remarkable resemblance to a major pop video from 1983.

The former Beatle spent two weeks at number one with anti-war song Pipes of Peace, and in the video he recreated the famous Christmas Day truce in 1914.

In the video McCartney played the parts of a British soldier, and his German counterpart, who shake hands in no man's land, play a game of football and exchange gifts - the same sequence seen in the new Sainsbury's advert.

Jonny Morris tweeted: 'Well done, Sainsbury's. You've made the video for Pipes of Peace without Pipes of Peace'.

Nik Wood-Jones wrote: 'Nice try @sainsburys but for a more realistic imagining of the 1914 #Christmas Truce, I prefer #Macca Pipes of Peace!' and Rachel Borland said: 'Love the sainsburys ad but macca did it first!'

MailOnline has compared images from the two films so you can decide for yourself, with the McCartney video at the top and the Sainsbury's advert at the bottom of each frame.

Beginning: Both films, Pipes of Peace above, and the Sainsbury's advert below, both set out that they are set at Christmas in 1914

Deep in thought: Paul McCartney takes a moment to look a picture of a loved one while the actor in the 2014 version looks at a box of his possessions

Powerful: Both films show the moment two young soldiers meet in no man's land and shake hands with each other

Warm: Marking the moment their conflict was set aside for Christmas was also shown in the two videos of the same event

Famous: The game of football between the two sides remains one of the most memorable moments of the 1914 story

Similar: The two videos both show the soldiers comparing pictures of their sweethearts back home

Symbolic: Both videos also showed the exchange of chocolate, which Sainsbury's believe sums up the spirit of Christmas
