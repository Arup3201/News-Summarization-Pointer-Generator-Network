It turns out there is one very big thing design and marketing guru Steve Jobs wanted to do before he died: design an Apple car.

The Apple co-founder and CEO reportedly told associates he wanted to create an iCar, reports Business Insider.

And Jobs reportedly told the Times' John Markoff, during a meeting prior to his death, that he wanted to 'take on Detroit.'

iLegacy: Tim Cook (pictured) replaced Jobs as Apple's CEO and has continued Jobs' legacy of innovation. But will he one day fulfill the dream of an iCar?

Longtime Apple board member Mickey Drexler, who is also the CEO of J. Crew, confirmed as much in May.

'It's a tragedy in America. Who is designing the cars?' Drexler said. 'Steve's dream before he died was to design an iCar.'

Drexler believes the never-realized Apple car could have made a serious impact in the American car market.

'It would've been probably 50% of the market. He never did design it,' he said.

The New York Times revisited the late genius's unfulfilled dream Sunday in a piece about Apple's foray into another market, that of wearable technology.

The tech giant is apparently poised to soon bring a watch-like wearable computer to the market with the help of a new, flexible glass developed by Corning.

Though the iCar may still be a fantasy, Apple's largest rival Google has already famously put weight behind a self-driving car.

The Google driverless car, as it's most often known, has been the subject of countless videos and news articles detailing the likelihood (or unlikelihood) of its success or even feasibility.

Whether Google will succeed or not remains to be seen, but the search giant is currently the only name in tech pumping untold research dollars into automobile research and development.

Car loving Apple devotees need not lose all hope, though.

Some big names in Apple leadership, Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller, are both big time car fans. In fact, Cue is even on the board of Ferrari.

So, iCar dreamers, stay tuned.
