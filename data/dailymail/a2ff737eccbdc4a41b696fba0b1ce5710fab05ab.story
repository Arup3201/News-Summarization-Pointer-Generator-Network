A warden ticketed a funeral limo while grieving relatives were being dropped off at St Saviour's Church (pictured)

Mourners watched in disbelief as a warden slapped a ticket on a funeral limousine while grieving relatives were being dropped off at a church.

Around 40 people saw the female warden issue the fine outside St Saviour's Church, in Lewisham High Street. 

When challenged she replied: 'I am doing my job'.

The hearse carrying the dead 85-year-old man was right behind the car which had been parked for nine minutes to allow people to congregate before going into the church.

Nicki Dunphy, of William Dunphy - Funeral Director Ltd, in Brockley, said: 'Everyone is outraged. 

'She brazenly put the ticket on the car when the family hadn’t even gone into the church. 

'We, and other funeral directors, have to stop to unload coffins and to let grieving families exit the cars. 

'There
are funerals every week at St Saviour's Church and dozens of other 
churches all over the borough and I’ve never heard of this happening 
before.

'People expect a bit of respect. This isn’t just a public car.

She added: 'This is the third funeral I have done for this family in a year. It is just really sad for them.'

Lewisham Council has since apologised for the distress caused and confirmed funeral hearses and limousines are exempt from parking restrictions in the borough. 

The family, parishioners and even a passing bus driver tried to reason with the ticket warden but she continued to issue the fine.

Ms Dunphy, 43, who lives in Southwark said: 'There were dozens of people shouting at her. 

'She said, "I am doing my job". 

'It was as if it was her against the world.'

The parking ticket has now been withdrawn. 

A Lewisham Council spokeswoman said: 'We apologise for any distress the issuing of this parking ticket has caused. 

'Funeral hearses and limousines are exempt from parking restrictions and the Penalty Charge Notice should not have been issued. It has now been withdrawn.'
