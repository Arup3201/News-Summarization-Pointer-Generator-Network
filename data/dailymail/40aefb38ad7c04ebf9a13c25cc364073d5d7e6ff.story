Eden Hazard gave three lucky Chelsea fans the surprise of a lifetime on Wednesday as the Belgian star stepped into the Stamford Bridge dugout for a game of FIFA 15.

The three fans were enjoying a special game themselves, with a large television gracing a section of the pitch as they played the popular video game.

Chelsea star Hazard popped out of the tunnel before shaking hands and sitting down to challenge his new friends to a game.

The former Lille winger's computer game skills would seem to be just as good as his form this season with Hazard winning the match 4-2.

Speaking after the surprise, competition winner Matthew Saunders said: 'I think the game was a little be fixed. I'll let him have it as he's a half decent player. He's class.'

Hazard, who revealed he enjoyed playing FIFA with friends, added: 'It was really good fun, and I hope it was a good surprise for them.

‘It was a good day for me because I won the game! It wasn’t easy but 4-2 was a good result for me.

‘I don’t know who is the best FIFA player at Chelsea but it’s not me, that’s for sure. It’s probably one of the young guys. In France they play it a lot so maybe Loic Remy or Kurt Zouma are the best, but they will both be better than me.’

The 23-year-old will be hoping Chelsea can continue their brilliant start to the 2014-15 Premier League season with three points against West Brom on Saturday.
