A Wisconsin family’s beloved dog was found killed by an arrow this week and her horrified owners believe hunters did it on purpose.

After Tanya and Chris Meyer of Rome posted their unthinkable tale on Facebook, support has poured in from animal lovers around the world to help this family get justice for one-year-old Labrador mix Zoey.

‘My daughter just loved her, and they had this special bond,’ said a grieving Tanya Meyer.

'My daughter just loved her, and they had this special bond': A Wisconsin couple was horrified this week when they found their beloved dog shot dead by a hunter's arrow

According to WTMJ, the Meyers believe Zoey was killed Friday after she went playing in the woods surrounding their home along with Maggie, the family’s other dog.

Tanya knew something was wrong when only Maggie returned that day.

‘I started calling for her and she wasn’t answering,’ Meyer told the LA Times.

Along with his father, Chris continued to search over the weekend.

Unthinkable: Tanya Meyer and her husband Chris believe their Lab mix Zoey was killed by hunter neighbors last Friday after she became a nuisance to them

Somethings amiss: One-year-old Zoey and the Meyer's other dog Maggie went into the woods surrounding their house Friday, but only Maggie came back

‘He asked some hunting neighbors,’ Tanya told WTMJ, ‘and they said “well, we saw her this morning and threw some sticks at 'em because they were bothering us in our tree stand but we haven't seen them since.”’

Three days later, Chris finally found Zoey. She was dead from an arrow wound under those very hunters’ tree stand.

The investigation is ongoing and the Meyers have thus far declined to name names, but they’re confident they know who took what was essentially one of their children.

‘For somebody that can do something like this, it's evil and it's cruel. You took our dog, you took our baby,’ said Tanya, who also has a 6-month-old baby girl.

‘She was just a perfect dog for my 
daughter to grow up with and then to find out that something like this 
happened, it was like “how could you?’”

The
Meyers posted their story on a Facebook page called Justice for Zoey 
and a post on the page has been shared nearly 150,000 times.

Chris Meyer, at right with his daughter, searched over the weekend for Zoey. He asked some hunter neighbors about her, and they said they'd seen the dog and threw sticks at her to get her away from their tree stand

Horrific: Days after Chris's encounter with the hunters, he found Zoey's body, kiled by an arrow, under the same hunters' tree stand

People from around the world have sent out their condolences and posted the stories of their own pet tragedies.

‘I can't believe it. It's like people from Hong Kong and Iceland and Europe. It's just nuts,’ Tanya told WTMJ. ‘We're not looking for handouts or money or anything. We just want our healing to be done and over with and to kind of move on.’

In the meantime, Rome Police Chief Sergeant Jason Lauby told the Times that police and the Adams County Sherriff's Department are still investigating.

But it’s the coldness of the crime that continues to stick with the Meyers, whether the culprits are caught or not.

‘To take the arrow out of her and to continue to hunt all weekend long, I just don’t have words for it. It sickens me,’ Tanya said. ‘I never thought people in the world were like this.’
