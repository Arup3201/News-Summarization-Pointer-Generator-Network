Facebook has unveiled a major redesign of its Newsfeed - and says it wants it to look more like a personalised magazine or newspaper.

Mark Zuckerberg said the radical overhaul reflects the huge amount of pictures being shared on the social networking site - which he revealed is now over 50% of the items shared.

However, it was also revealed that along with bigger pictures, the advertisments Facebook's billion users will see will get bigger.

All Friends - a feed that shows you everything your friends are sharing

Photos - a feed with nothing but photos from your friends and the Pages you like

Music - a feed with posts about the music you listen to

Following - a feed with the latest news from the Pages you like and the people you follow

'Our mission is to make the world more open and connected,' said Zuckerberg at the launch.

'Newsfeed is one of the most important services we build, and we want to to give people around the world the best personalised news.'

Zuckerberg had singled out the feature as in need of a makeover as recently as January, when the company introduced 'graph search' to address inadequacies in allowing users to trawl for information across the world's largest social network.

Robyn Morris, the designer of the new Newsfeed, admitted that as pictures got bigger for users, so would ads.

'Integrating ads isn't something we really thought about,' he claimed.

'This redesign is about letting the content shine - whether that's from a musician, sponsored or from friends.

'The adverts will be bigger and richer, along with everything else.'

Julie Zhuo, Facebook's director of design, said the firm was 'putting these pictures front and centre - they are more immersive.'

She said the new designed was similar to a magazine table of contents.

'The new newsfeed is richer, simpler more beautiful newsfeed or desktop and mobile,' she said.

The firm also revealed the new look will make the mobile phone and tablet apps look more like the desktop site.

The changes are Facebook's also attempt to 
learn more about its users and keep people coming back so the company 
can sell more advertising.

Robyn Morris, the designer of the new Newsfeed, told MailOnline he has been working on the project for a year.

'When we began we weren't sure what we would be doing,' he admitted.

'One early study used cut up paper to get people to rearrange their newsfeed.

'We found people really want to be able to see just posts from friends, and see photos

'We decided if we're going to be showing photos, we need to have a design that gave them centre stage.'

The new look was inspired by the firm's mobile apps.

'It starts to feel like mobile and desktop are made of the same material, we don't want people to have to learn things twice.'

Morris also said the firm still treated Facebook as a third party app -even thought the firm owns the retro picture service.

'Instagram remain an independent app - even thought they are in house

It's been really interesting to have them here, to make sure third party apps look good - they are guinea pigs in many ways.

The team behind the redesign was tiny - with Morris and one other designer working with engineers.

'The design team was small - me and one other designer, in fact.

'It's been a big undertaking, it's a high profile page - and we've had a lot of help.

'We've been bunkered down in a room working closely with engineers - 15 of us in a conference room turned war room.'

'Panda was the mascot - black and white like a newspaper, so somewhere along the way we adopted it - we all call each other pandas.'

The event comes a month after a Pew study reported that many Facebook users take a break from the site for weeks at a time.

The report, from the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, found that some 61 percent of Facebook users had taken a hiatus for reasons that range from boredom to too much irrelevant information to Lent.

Overall, though, Facebook's user base is growing, especially on mobile devices. At last count it had 1.06 billion active monthly accounts.Â 

Mark Zuckerberg said the redesign was triggered by a huge increase in pictures being shared on the service, with 50% of items now being shared photos

Facebook's new design will also make the site look the same on both desktop and mobile computers

The number of people who access Facebook daily is also on the rise.

That said, even the company has acknowledged that some of its users, especially the younger ones, are migrating to substitutes, but so far this has not meant an overall decline in user numbers.

The world's largest social network is moving to regain Wall Street's confidence after a botched IPO last year, addressing concerns about its long-term prospects - many of which center on an industry-wide shift toward the use of mobile devices.

Facebook shares, which are still more than a quarter off their IPO price of $38, were up 2 percent at $27.99 on Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq.

Facebook and Google, which both got their start on desktop computers, are now managing a transition of their products onto smartphones and tablets, which typically yield less revenue than on PCs.

The two Internet mainstays are also waging a war for revenue in mobile advertising - a market that is still small compared with the traditional desktop but that is growing exponentially.

In terms of overall mobile advertising, Google commanded a 53.5 percent share in 2012, aided by its dominance in search-based ads.

Facebook had just 8.4 percent, a distant runner-up, according to estimates from research house eMarketer.

'For example, we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with Facebook in favor of increased engagement with other products and services such as Instagram,' the company said last month in the "risk factors" of its annual report.

'In the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in user engagement and our business could be harmed.'
