Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta has asked to leave the club.

The former Barcelona and Inter Milan player is said to be disgruntled with the management and has had divided opinions with other senior members of the squad recently. 

The 32-year-old was an option for Arsenal at one stage of his career but suffered with bad knee injuries before rebuilding his game.

Motta's teammate Ezequiel Lavezzi also wants out of Paris while Edinson Cavani's future is likely to be away from the French capital, although he will remain until the summer.

Lavezzi and Cavani were each handed an undisclosed fine by the French champions this week after returning late following the mid-season break.

The South American pair have also been asked to train away from the first team following their failure to attend the training camp. 

Meanwhile, Arsenal are continuing talks with St Etienne over Loic Perrin with the French club now chasing £8million for the 29-year-old captain. 

Speaking after St Etienne’s Coupe de France victory over AS Nancy, he said: 'I have been contacted personally. Arsenal is interested.'
