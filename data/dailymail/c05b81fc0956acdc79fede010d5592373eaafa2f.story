'The caption contradicts our expectations, recounting a shanty town devastated by a fire whose dead go unreported, its cause unrecorded.

'This photograph gains power from the contrast between evocation of heroic endeavour and a sense of dispiriting futility.'

The final 94 works will now go on display at the Royal Geographical Society, London, from June 23 until July 4 - then touring nationally until November.
