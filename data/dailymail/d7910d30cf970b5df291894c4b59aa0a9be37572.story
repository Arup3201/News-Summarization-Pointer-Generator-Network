London's annual festival of cycling kicked off in spectacular fashion this morning by setting a new world record for the largest bicycle bell ensemble.

More than 600 cyclists, led by Olympic gold medallist Laura Trott and former British downhill skier Chemmy Alcott, took part in the RideLondon event at Guildhall Yard, near St Paul's Cathedral.

Accompanied by bell-ringing musicians from the Guildhall School of Music, they easily surpassed the previous record of 503 cycling bell-ringers set
 in 2003 by the University of Leipzig in Germany.

Miss Trott, 22, who was racing later in 
the day in the grand prix event, said it had been worth getting up early
 for what is her second world record.

'It was 
really exciting. I was part of the one they tried to do last year and it
 wasn't successful so it was really nice to see happy, smiley faces at 
the end of it,' she said.

'Our team pursuit team actually holds the world record for the team pursuit so this is my second one.'

The 30-minute attempt, involving a total of 639 cyclists, was carried out in front of officials 
from the Guinness Book of Records.Â

The orchestra was conducted by the school's Dominic Wheeler, who was working with bike bells for 
the first time in his career to perform a specially-composed variation 
on the Westminster Chimes.

The performance kicked off a weekend of Prudential RideLondon cycling events in the capital, including the opening of a 10-mile traffic-free route on closed roads through the city.

Around 50,000 people are expected to ride past iconic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London.

Tomorrow, the RideLondon-Surrey 100 ride starts in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in east London.

Miss Trott, who lives in Essex, added: 'For me when I was growing up there was 
never really those opportunities - they would never shut down a whole 
city.

'For cycling to have come that far and be able to do that is 
incredible.'

Miss Trott and Olympic and Tour de France star Sir Bradley Wiggins will take part tomorrow in a 100-mile road race which ends on The Mall.

The London-Surrey event will also star 2012 world champion, Philippe Gilbert, and 2014 Tour de France top 10 finisher, Laurens ten Dam.

Miss Trott said she was slightly daunted by riding 100 miles for the first time.

She is taking part with her father, uncle and her sister, a former professional cyclist.
