Glastonbury fans have forked out a staggering £25million on tickets for next year's festival as all 120,000 places sold out in record time today.

Music lovers snapped up all of the coveted tickets in just 87 minutes - sending internet servers into meltdown.

Their frantic purchasing - seeing an eye-watering 3,000 tickets bought every minute - beat last year's record by more than 10 minutes.

More than a million would-be festivalgoers got up early in a bid to secure a spot at the legendary event.

They descended on official booking website seetickets.com at 9am in the hope of buying one of the £210 tickets.

However, fans were forced to wait half an hour after site crashed due to overwhelming demand.

Delighted: Organiser Emily Eavis and her father Michael said they had been 'blown away' by the overwhelming demand for tickets

By 10am, a whopping 80,000 tickets had already been bought and less than half an hour later, organiser Emily Eavis announced the remainder had gone.

She tweeted: 'We have sold out in record time. Thanks to everyone for all your efforts and patience and we are very sorry to those of you who missed out.'

In a joint statement with her father Michael Eavis, she said the pair had been 'blown away' by the size of demand.

It read: 'We are sorry that many of you missed out on a ticket. We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability thatsome people will be left disappointed.'

An allocation of early-bird tickets - offered to selected fans - went on sale on Thursday and were snapped up within 30 minutes.

Earlier this year, Mr Eavis said 2014's headliners - who have never played Glastonbury before - had already been booked, but refused to reveal who they were.

Fleetwood Mac, Prince, David Bowie and even Oasis - who have not played together since a bitter split in 2009 - have all been tipped to appear.

This year's bash at Worthy Farm, Pilton, Somerset, saw the Rolling Stones headline the famous Pyramid Stage to rave reviews.
