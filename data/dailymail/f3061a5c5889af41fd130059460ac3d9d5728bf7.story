A Green Party MEP is demanding that immigrants who come to Britain to beg and commit crimes should be guaranteed the right to full state benefits and even be provided with police protection.

Jean Lambert, MEP for London, is calling for new laws to protect immigrants from being excluded from social security benefits, under plans currently being put forward by David Cameron.

In a bid to curb so-called benefits tourism, the Prime Minister has announced plans to curb rights to housing, health care and cash support from those immigrants who arrive in the UK with no job.

But in a European parliament report which calls on the European Commission to oppose Mr Cameron’s initiatives, Miss Lambert is demanding unlimited healthcare for immigrants and an overhaul of the social security system to ensure they are provided with sufficient financial support during their stay in the UK.

In particular, she wants the hoards of Roma Gypsies – in particular the women – who illegally harass people on the streets of central London to 'not be excluded' from social security benefits as 'undocumented migrants'.

In a draft report, Miss Lambert claims 'Women of ethnic background like Roma' have special needs, which MEPs will vote on in the coming weeks – long before the end of the year when Romanians and Bulgarians are given full rights of residency in the UK.

The centrepiece of Cameron’s reforms is a six-month limit on the right of EU nationals to claim out-of-work benefits, which is coming under increased attack by Eurocrats in Brussels – who will now join forces with Jean lambert MEP who also wants Mr Cameron’s immigration reforms derailed.

Miss Lambert’s report, aimed at ‘vulnerable groups’ does however include protecting older people in care from also missing out on benefits and proper care – or receiving  very low quality care which only extends to 'cleaning and feeding'.

In it she calls on the European Commission however to force the government to 'carry out studies and surveys' to show how poorer immigrants are also being 'affected by austerity measures'.

However, Miss Lambert wants Romas and
illegal ‘immigrants’ to not only receive benefits from the government 
for often working in illegal rackets, but for them to also to benefit 
from special protection against any bad feeling from British citizens 
who might show their anger against them.

The
London MEP and former teacher argues in her report for them to be 
protected legally against 'hate speech, bullying and assault' as they 
are often considered 'too much to care for'.

And she has the support of the powerful European Commission which recently warned Mr Cameron that its officials would 'scrutinise' his reforms for fairness.

Yet it has already come under attack from UKIP.

'The welfare state in this country exists to provide a safety net for hard times and it should be available to those who have paid into it through their taxes' argues the UKIP deputy leader, Paul Nuttell MEP.

'Our public services are already overstretched and it is irresponsible to allow them to be put under yet more pressure' he told the Daily Mail On Line last night.

They warned that his proposals – including restrictions on housing, health and unemployment support – must comply with EU free movement rules. Tory MP Stewart Jackson warned the EU to “show some respect'.

He insisted that decisions on immigration must be decided by the British parliament and he promised to 'strengthen' tests to ensure only those who pay into the system are able to receive handouts.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of pressure group Migration Watch UK, said: 'It is surely only fair that everybody should contribute to the welfare system before they can draw benefits.'

Just recently a group of 60 Roma gypsies arrived in Marble Arch in London and are currently camping in Hyde Park, where Police are only able to occasionally check on their passports.

Tourists have been reported as seeing woman squat in open view in the park, as open top tour buses trail past what was once a highlight of the London sightseeing tour.

Britain is preparing itself for a predicted influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when they are given free access to our jobs market in January. MigrationWatch has warned that 50,000 could arrive in the UK every year for five years from 2014.
