Tottenham defender Zeki Fryers has joined Crystal Palace on a three-year deal after completing his medical.

The 21-year-old product of the Manchester United youth academy has moved to Selhurst Park to become the Eagles' first signing of transfer deadline day for £3million.

Fryers made only two Barclays Premier League appearances during his spell at Old Trafford before moving to play in Belgium with Standard Liege.

The England Under 19 international returned to England when he signed for Spurs in 2013 but could not establish himself at White Hart Lane.

Fryers revealed he was first made aware of Palace's interest over the weekend and becomes Neil Warnock's second addition since the 65-year-old replaced Tony Pulis as manager in south London.

'I found out over the weekend from my agent that there was interest and I knew Crystal Palace were the best club for me at this time of my career,' said Fryers. 

Back in town: Neil Warnock has returned to Crystal Palace after he was appointed for a second spell 

'I am very excited to be here and it's a fresh start for me now. I can't wait to get out on the training pitch and show what I can do.

'I have met Neil Warnock this morning and we had a good chat about the game and things on and off the pitch. I am really looking forward to working with such a great manager and getting to know my new team-mates.'

Warnock returned for a second stint managing Palace last week, succeeding Pulis, who quit the club on the eve of the new Premier League season after a row with the board over transfer policy.

The former Sheffield United boss' first act in charge at Selhurst Park was to complete the season-long loan deal for Wilfried Zaha's return from Manchester United.

Zaha fired an injury-time goal at Newcastle on Saturday as Palace stole a 3-3 draw in the north east.
