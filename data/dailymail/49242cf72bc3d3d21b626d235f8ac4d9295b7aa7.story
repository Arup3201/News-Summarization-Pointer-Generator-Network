Given the amount of hours that are wasted playing games on phones and tablets, it was only a matter of time before someone put all this game play to good use.

Cancer Research UK has teamed up with agency Guerilla Tea to develop a game that will help scientists research faulty genes.

Called Play to Cure: Genes in Space, the game is similar to Space Invaders, and as players navigate through the on-screen asteroids they are helping to create new genetic patterns.

A computer app for GPs that tells them their patient might have cancer could save hundreds of lives a year.

The app, created by the University of Exeter Medical school, costs £50 per surgery and can help doctors diagnose some of the deadliest forms of the disease far more quickly.

The app works by recording patients’ symptoms whenever they visit the surgery even if they see a different doctor or nurse and turn up out-of-hours.

If a patient has a number of symptoms which could be cancer – but might otherwise be dismissed as harmless – a message flashes up on the doctor’s screen.

Researchers believe it could enable up to 3,000 more cases of cancer to 
be detected sooner leading to 300 lives saved annually due to earlier 
treatment.

To create the game, Cancer Research UK collected over two million pieces of data from 2,000 breast cancer patients in the UK and Canada.

Travelling in a world set 800 years in the future, players guide a spaceship safely through an intergalactic assault course, gathering along the way a fictional cargo called Element Alpha.

Each route that gamers choose to fly the spaceship, and each piece of Element Alpha collected, uses data taken from these cancer patients' genes to create a new genetic pattern.

Every time the game is played, these patterns are fed back to scientists who can detect hot spots in faulty genes within these patterns that could be targeted with new treatments.

This in turn should help them develop new drugs that target specific genetic faults, and new ways to figure out how to stop cancer developing in the first place.

The researchers created the game because there was too much data for a scientists to sift through manually.

The free game, available on iOS and Android, has already been downloaded 1,700 times.

The more people that play the game, the more accurate the results, and once 10,000 people have downloaded and played the game, scientists will start to analyse the data.

All the information will be fed back to a Cancer Research laboratory at Cambridge University.

Hannah Keartland, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'Our world-first smartphone game is simply out of this world.

‘Not only is it great fun to play - but every single second gamers spend directly helps our work to bring forward the day all cancers are cured.

'Our scientists' research produces colossal amounts of data, some of which can only be analysed by the human eye - a process which can take years.

'We hope thousands of people worldwide will play the game as often as possible, to help our researchers get through this data.

'If the game is successful, it could be used to look at data for other types of cancer such as prostate and lung cancer.'

BBC comedian Dara O Briain, who launched the game in London, said: 'Teenagers will now be able to turn to their parents and say 'I am curing cancer as opposed to wasting my time playing games.

'It's fantastic, we couldn't have done this 10 years ago. This technique of using crowd-sourcing to look at huge amounts of data is a new science.'

Scientists generally use computer software to trawl through large amounts of data generated by microarrays, yet but in many cases these are not accurate enough.
