Disgraced: Roseanna Langley, 24, lost her job after details of the affair came to light

A disgraced teacher who had sex with a 16-year-old pupil could be jailed for planning a holiday with him to Rome.

Roseanna Langley, 24, was taken into custody and had her passport seized for breaching her court order by not giving police enough notice of her travel plans.

Langley lost her dream career because of relationship with the boy, now 17. She was given a suspended prison sentence and signed the sex offenders' register last year.

A court heard how she groomed the boy, who cannot be named, for sex, sent him naked pictures and lied about being pregnant and miscarrying his child to prolong the affair.

Langley admitted two count of sexual activity with a male aged 13-17 while in a position of trust. She was given an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years, and was told to attend a sex offenders’ course.

The former science teacher was led in handcuffs to Exeter Magistrates' Court today after spending a night in the cells.

The court was told how she had already broken a rule in her court order which required her to notify them of foreign travel a week before leaving. Langley and the boy, with whom she is still having a relationship, went to Norway in January but only told officers afterwards.

Yesterday, weeks after being cautioned, she went to her local police station to tell them about the Rome trip, due to begin on Sunday.

Explicit messages: In July a jury was told how she sent hundreds of explicit texts to the boy, as well as naked pictures

Police arrested her and seized her passport and she spent the night in the cells. Yesterday she admitted breaching her notification requirements.

The court was told about her affair with the youth which has continued.

Miss Vanessa Francis, defending, said their relationship has continued and Langley was not his teacher before she was sacked and the lad left the school and is no longer a pupil.

Breach: Langley admitted breaching the conditions of her court order after not giving officers proper warning of her foreign holidays

She said their relationship is known 
to the probation service and they were heading off to Rome for a few 
days before he joins the Army in Yorkshire at the end of next week.

She has quit her job in a fast food outlet and is returning to her father’s home in Cornwall.

Miss Francis said: 'She has not been trying to hide what she has been doing from the police. Her ultimate goal was to be a teacher. But what she did was wrong.'

Appearance: Roseanne Langley, seen at Exeter Crown Court last year

Prosecutor Deborah Hodges said Langley claimed to have ‘forgotten’ about telling the police when she was going abroad - even though she had cautioned just a few weeks earlier following the Norwegian holiday.

Exeter magistrates sent the case to the city’s Crown Court for a judge to sentence her next month. She was bailed.

Her boyfriend, who cannot be identified for legal reasons because of his age, sat in the public gallery and waved to her as she was led up from the cells in tears.

When she last appeared in that court last July a judge heard that Langley sent text messages to the teenager which included: 'Baby please let me tie you up tomorrow, it’s so sexy’ and ‘babe I love planning our future together’.

Pupils at the Exeter secondary school became aware of their relationship after she invited students to her flat to watch films. They said the couple kissed and cuddled before going to her bedroom.

Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said: 'I am told you had wanted to be a teacher since you were a child. You have destroyed that. You will never teach children again.'
