A Scotsman who married in a kilt, supports Rangers, likes white pudding and drinks Irn-Bru is now being tipped as the possible ruler of Germany.

After climbing high and fast through the ranks of Germany’s CDU conservative party, pundits speculate great things lie in store for 41-year-old David McAllister, who is up for re-election as governor in the state of Lower Saxony later this month.

The son of a German mother and a Scottish father from the tough Gorbals area of Glasgow, he is recognised as one of the leading figures in Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union party.

He has a massive following in the wealthy state he leads - so much so that the rival Social Democrats seeking to oust him accuse his party machine of 'creating a Cuba-like cult of personality around him.'

Even so, they are unlikely to topple the man who within a decade is expected to lead Germany.

In 2008, he was appointed head of the CDU in Lower Saxony, the second most important and powerful regional post in the country.

In 2010, he became the state governor - one of a number of mixed-nationality citizens changing the political landscape of the Fatherland.

Mr McAllister, who has dual British-German nationality, grew up in Berlin, where his father, James, was a British Army officer on attachment with the signals corps.

Before that he was a captain with the 51st Highland Division on active service in Germany during the Second World War.

Growing up enclosed by the Berlin Wall left its mark on Mr McAllister.

He said: 'Berlin was surrounded by communism – that is how I experienced it as a child. This left its mark, and since then my motto has been "future, not socialism".'

Previously, the youngest conservative party parliamentary leader in Germany, McAllister is a trained lawyer who party insiders believe could be on the chancellorship ticket within ten years.

He is known to be well liked – and well rated – by current leader Angela Merkel.

Mr McAllister is the first British citizen ever to hold such high office in Germany. Despite feeling German, he described his upbringing as 'very British – British network, British schools.

'While most of the other kids went home to relatives in Britain, I had a German mum so I grew up fluent in both languages.'

He said his parents imbued him with an equal sense of pride in Scotland and Germany.

However, when he was 11, the family moved to the North Sea coastal town of Bad Bederska, a move which made it 'more or less clear to me that we had turned German then'.

Mr McAllister still returns to Scotland to visit cousins in Newton Mearns, and enjoys the odd can of Irn-Bru and shortcake at Christmas.

He added: 'I guess the other Scottish thing is I take milk in my tea.'

A keen supporter of Rangers and Hanover football clubs, Mr McAllister also plays for the parliamentary 11. Position? 'Like my politics,' he said. 'Centre right.'

Though McAllister proposed to his wife on the shores of Loch Ness and married in a kilt, he is keen not to be categorised as the CDU's token German-Scottish politician and only uses his mother tongue with his two young daughters at home.

While he insists that he does not have Berlin in his sights just yet, others are convinced he is on the path to greatness.

German weekly Stern compared McAllister's career path to that of three-time Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany's longest-serving postwar leader.

Should ‘Mac’, as the headline writers call him - and 'Big Mac' after he took over the premiership of Lower Saxony - seek Germany's highest office, he has the potential to be Chancellor, said Klaus Wallbaum, political editor at the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, a Hanover-based daily.

'There aren't really that many others in the CDU of his age who look like coming through,' he said. 'It could happen.'

Karl-Heinz Nassmacher, a political scientist at Oldenburg University, said the Scottish name would not hurt his chances. 'It wouldn't bother anyone here,' he said.

McAllister met his wife, Dunja Kolleck, when they were studying law in Hanover.

They have two daughters, Jamie Elizabeth and Mia Louise, and the family live in Bad Bederska.
