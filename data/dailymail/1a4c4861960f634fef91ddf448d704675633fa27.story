A veteran Labour MP has launched a withering attack on the party’s leadership for failing to connect with voters.

Former actress Glenda Jackson, 78, said Labour had gone too long without outlining any policies and was still struggling to get through to the public.

She said: ‘For far too long, we didn't have a policy to bless ourselves with and we still have this inherent problem that we do have policies but still aren't selling them strongly enough. It’s not playing out there.’

She added: ‘You do wonder who’s advising him [Miliband], sometimes.’

Glenda Jackson sparked controversy after attacking Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons during a special session to honour the former Prime Minister

When asked about Mr Miliband’s vision of a ‘one-nation’ Britain, in an interview for the New Statesman magazine, she said: ‘I don’t like visionaries. I was taught the only path a leader will take is up the garden path.’

Ms Jackson, a double Oscar winning actress who famously appeared on Morcambe and Wise as Cleopatra, also hit out at the sexism in Parliament.

She said when she spoke up after a male MP had ignored a female colleague it was like ‘as though we had attempted some kind of castration’.

Ms Jackson said when she was first elected to the Commons in 1992 she was treated as either an ‘airhead’ or a ‘diva’.

She said: I was treated either as an airhead who would fall flat on her face or as some unconscionably egotistical diva who would demand treatment different to everybody else. 

'Neither of those assessments bears any relation to me whatsoever.’

Ms Jackson, who has been a Labour MP since 1992, won the Oscar for best actress in 1969 and 1972. She famously appeared on Morcambe and Wise at the height of her fame in the 1970s

Ms Jackson is standing down next year after more than 20 years in the Commons as the MP for Hampstead.

She said: ‘I shall be almost 80.. You need somebody younger. This country is in danger of being governed by pensioners like me. I don’t think that’s the best way forward.’
