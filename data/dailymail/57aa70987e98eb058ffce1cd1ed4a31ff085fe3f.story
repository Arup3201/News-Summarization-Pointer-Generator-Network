Amir Khan has staged a tongue-in-cheek 'come and fight me' plea to Floyd Mayweather Jnr as the American pound-for-pound king closes in on a multi-million dollar fight with Manny Pacquiao.

It is understood undefeated five-division world champion Mayweather is ready to complete terms with Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum in Los Angeles on Friday for a May 2 superfight.

But Briton Khan is keen to muscle in, attempting to goad the 37-year-old WBC and WBA welterweight champion into taking him on instead of the 36-year-old Filipino WBO holder.

Khan has been long hoping for a fight against the world's best boxer

In a video seen exclusively by Sportsmail from boxing suppliers RDX, Khan comically dons a facemask of Mayweather and holds out a wad of money in hand.

He then attempts to goad his illusive opponent further, whilst pointing at a giant wall projection spelling out 'Who are ya?' as he looks to up the pressure on the American to give in and fight him.

Despite the Bolton hero's best efforts, Mayweather is likely to snub Khan and give boxing fans the bout they have long-awaited.

Mayweather has previously been dismissive about Khan despite the 28-year-old's impressive victory over Devon Alexander last December.

WBC silver welterweight holder Khan is determined to become a world champion again but may have to be patient in his bid to conquer either Mayweather or Pacquiao with a fight against fellow Brit Kell Brook - the IBF champion - a possibility later this year.

Indeed, Khan will be an interested bystander once Mayweather and Pacquiao eventually lock horns. The pair are expected to clash this spring in the American's hometown of Las Vegas at the MGM Grand in a mega-fight worth at least $300million (£197m).

Mayweather wants to fight on May 2, the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday, as has been his tradition in recent years. 

But that date has also been earmarked for Miguel Cotto's proposed clash with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico rivalry.

Mayweather said last month: 'The public want this fight. I want it. The only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on. I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on.

Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field.

'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.'

Reports in America over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed, as well as a drug testing programme.

The final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with Mayweather refusing to agree to a 50/50 division.

But Pacquiao has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted.

Before Christmas he told Sky Sports: 'Mayweather can get the amount he wants. I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. 'So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing.

Khan is likely to miss out on his chance to fight Mayweather, who looks set to face Manny Pacquiao

'He has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep.

'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.'

Khan will be more than willing to step in, however, if negotiations break down between boxing's long-standing arch-rivals.
