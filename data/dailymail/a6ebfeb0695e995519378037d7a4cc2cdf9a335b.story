Jimmy White's bid to play in the World Snooker Championship for the first time since 2006 ended on Monday as he crashed to defeat by Matthew Selt.

White had defeated James Wattana in his qualifying opener on Saturday and needed two more wins to to reach the main event at the Crucible.

But it wasn't to be for 'The Whirlwind' as he lost 10-8 to world No 30 Selt in a tense battle on Monday night.

White, the 52-year-old who lost all six World Championship finals he played, had looked good for the win after taking a 7-2 lead after the opening session in the morning.

But Selt came storming back in the evening session and reeled off eight off the next nine frames to go through to Wednesday's final qualifiers.

Six-time world champions Steve Davis, 57, was also knocked out as he slumped to a 10-1 defeat by Kurt Maflin.
