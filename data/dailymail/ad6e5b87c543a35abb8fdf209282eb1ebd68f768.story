Young Wasps fly-half Alex Lozowski scored 22 points to inspire his team to a 43-22 win over London Irish and give them a chance to progress to the LV= Cup knock-out stages.

Lozowski booted five penalties and converted all four of his side's tries as Wasps grabbed a crucial bonus point in their battle for qualification.

Prop Simon McIntyre, wing Josh Bassett, number eight Guy Thompson and replacement Elliot Daly went over for the home tries as they replied from three points down at the break to win the second period 27-3.

Irish fly-half Myles Dorrian kept his side in the game during the opening period with four penalties and a conversion of prop Leo Halavatau's try, but could only add one further penalty before the end.

The key to the win was the Wasps pack, who were dominant at the set-piece, but their mistakes within kicking distance kept Irish in the game during the first period.

Dorrian took advantage of an early error with a penalty and added a second to keep his side in front after Lozowski had opened the hosts' account.

But the powerful pack set the trend and were at the forefront of Wasps' opening try when a drive reached the Irish line and McIntyre picked up from a ruck, went left around the fringe and found a gap for a converted touchdown.

Wasps started to stretch out when Lozowski booted his second penalty, but another error saw the clinical Exiles fly-half make it a third successful penalty.

And the Exiles chipped away at the Wasps lead again with the half-time whistle approaching and got to within four points as Dorrian struck for a fourth time, this penalty from 38 metres.

And the visitors' tenacity paid off as centre Ross Neal, who had come close to scoring earlier in the half, nearly got a try, but was hauled down just short. Yet, from the series of rucks that followed, nobody could stop powerful Tongan Halavatau from going over from two metres.

With Dorrian converting and adding another penalty on the re-start, Irish were set fair with a six-point advantage.

But that was as good as it got for Irish, whose hopes of progression are now hanging by a thread.

Wasps retook the lead when Bassett finished off a great move which involved his stand-off in the left corner, with the conversion taking his side a point to the good.

The home side never lost the lead after that - and did not look likely to either as two more penalties from Lozowski put Wasps further ahead.

Irish did not help themselves when replacement prop Jamie Hagan found himself in the sin-bin inside the final quarter of the game.

And that signalled the end of the Irish challenge. The home fly-half put his forwards five metres from the Exiles line and, with them a man down, a driving line-out saw Thompson easily bundle his way over.

The bonus point was sealed when Wasps turned over an Irish attack near the home line for a spectacular 80-metre converted try which was started by Lozowski and finished by flyer Daly.
