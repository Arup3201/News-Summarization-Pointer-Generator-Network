Murdered: Sultan Ahmed, 20, was stabbed to death by a friend's neighbour following an argument over a drain

A young man who stepped in to mediate in a fight between two neighbouring families was stabbed to death with a carving knife.

Sultan Ahmed, a 20-year-old aspiring lawyer, stepped in to act as a 'peacemaker' in a violent machete brawl which had followed a row over a leaking drain.

Shofique Uddin, 51, stabbed Mr Ahmed to death after a neighbourhood spat on the Isle of Dogs.

Uddin's wife Gulbahar Begum, 51, was accused of handing her husband a carving knife, allegedly telling him ‘kill those sons of b******’.

The Uddin/Begums and the family next door had not had much contact until a blockage caused dirty water to seep into the Uddin/Begums' garden.

The Uddin/Begums confronted their 
neighbour Doyarun Nessa over the fence when she was in the garden 
cleaning carpets and she was branded ‘****ing lowlife’ in Bengali by one
 of Uddin’s sons.

Mrs Nessa was in tears and told her son Zishan Ahmed, 27, what had happened when he returned home later that day.

‘What
 should have amounted to no more than a trivial neighbourly dispute 
turned quite unnecessarily into a dreadful display of violence that left
 one young man dead and three further people injured,' said prosecutor 
Ed Brown.

‘The facts of this
 case demonstrate in very stark terms how quickly and seriously an 
incident can escalate with terrible results once a decision is taken to 
use a knife.

‘The tragedy is that Sultan Ahmed was something of a peacemaker during these events.’

Despite
 sharing their last name, Mr Ahmed was not in a member of the insulted 
family, but was part of the group who went to speak to the 
Uddin/Begums on their doorstep.

A bystander caught what happened on his mobile phone as the two groups clashed.

Begum kicked Mr Ahmed in the leg and the rivals began pushing and shoving each other.

‘Within a very short time Begum appeared with a large and very dangerous knife in both hands,’ Mr Brown said.

‘She had plainly collected it from her kitchen at the back of the house and come to use it against those she saw who had come to her front door.

One witness said Begum was ‘really going for it’ and the video clip shows her bringing down the machete from over her head.

Although two men were injured, Begum was cleared of wounding with intent.

Killer: Shofique Uddin, 51, stabbed Mr Ahmed in the back with a carving knife

Uddin was held in a headlock as he brandished the blade, but he managed to struggle free and knifed Mr Ahmed in the back.

‘He can be seen to hold the knife up in the air, then lunge towards the group with is striking down towards the back of the deceased,’ said Mr Brown.

Joynal Khan needed six stitches to a cut to his head, and Rahim Ahmed was badly cut on the right shoulder by the machete.

Mr Ahmed was lying in a pool of blood when paramedics arrived, but died at the scene.

His sister Jannatul Ferdous said the family continue to be ‘heartbroken’ by the loss of Sultan.

‘She speaks about the heartbreak the family have suffered since his death, and how it continues to have devastating effect upon them and their lives’, said prosecutor Ed Brown.

‘She described him as an inspiration to the family, full of life and a popular member of all of those groups he was a member of.’

Sultan, a charity fundraiser who came third in a contest to be the young mayor of his borough at the age of 16, aspired to become a lawyer and ‘had a great future ahead of him’.

Mr Brown added: ‘She ultimately describes her brother, how his funeral filled the mosque, and he was a charismatic, deeply loved, and caring human being.’

Uddin
 admitted stabbing Mr Ahmed but told the court he only wanted to ‘injure
 him a little’ because he would not let the family go back into their 
own house.

Begum said: ‘I tried to scare them, to drive them away. I picked up the instrument used for cooking to frighten the attackers.’

Uddin denied murder and Gulbahar Begum 
denied two charges of wounding with intent.

Their daughter Rahela Begum was cleared of 
causing actual bodily harm.

Begum was cleared of both charges she faced and Uddin was found guilty by a majority of 10-2.

He is due to be sentenced tomorrow.
