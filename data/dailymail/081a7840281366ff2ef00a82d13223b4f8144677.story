As Jonny Wilkinson played his last ever match on British soil, the Toulon fly-half rolled back time to his most famous moment in 2003.

During the first half of the Heineken Cup final in Cardiff, Wilkinson kicked a drop goal reminiscent of his famous strike against Australia that won the Rugby World Cup for England 11 years ago in Sydney.

The right-footed kick gave Toulon a 10-3 lead over Saracens, and the French side went on to win 23-6 at the Millennium Stadium.

After the game, Wilkinson told Sky Sports:
 'It's a hell of a feeling. I can't say enough just how proud I am to be
 part of this team, to have been able to play in this competition, 
against teams like that.

'We've
 had a hell of a time, week left in our season so we'll carry on. How 
emotional? It's up there. There's a lot of relief, lot of excitement, 
sheer adulation, and at the moment I'm just trying to take it all in.'

End of the road: Wilkinson will retire at the end of the season, after the French Top 14 final next weekend

Wilkinson will retire from rugby at the end of the season after the French Top 14 final against Castres next weekend.

His drop goal against Australia in 2003 made him a national hero and delivered England their first ever Rugby World Cup victory with a 20-17 win.

A Heineken Cup victory was a fitting way for Wilkinson to end his career on British soil. The fly half played 91 times for England between 1998 and 2011, scoring 1,179 points.
