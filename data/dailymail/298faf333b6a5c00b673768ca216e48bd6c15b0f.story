They represent materialism  to the extreme.

So fittingly, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spare no expense when it comes to their daughter North.

The 16-month-old lives a life of luxury most people - children and adults alike - could only dream of, and new details have emerged of just how extravagant her lifestyle really is.

Little Princess: New details have emerged of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North's lavish lifestyle, pictured last month in Paris 

According to US Weekly, the tot has over 200 pieces of designer clothing that she's never worn.

Items in her closet include a $375 silk Oscar de la Renta dress, a $200 leopard viscose frock from Roberto Cavalli, an Alexander Wang leather dress, and Giuseppe Zanotti custom-made shoes.

'Kim and Kanye are grateful when designers send them some pieces,' a source told the magazine. 'North loves clothes and getting ready to go out. It's a lot of fun.'

In addition, North is also the owner of some pricey bling, most notably half-carat Lorraine Schwartz studs worth 'well over $50,000,' said the insider.

The couple also ensure North's surroundings are similarly lavish.

Although North has lived mostly at the Hidden Hills, California house of her grandmother Kris Jenner (known as 'Lovey' to the little girl), the couple just purchased a $20 million mansion down the road, replete with a walk-in closet just for North.

Her current playroom, meanwhile, contains 'tons of dolls,' said the source. 'She loves to push them in strollers.'

Only the best: Kim allegedly keeps 'at least' five strollers - including the $940 Orbit Baby G2 Travel System - in key locales around the globe, the couple pictured last month in Paris with their Urbo2 pushchair from Mamas & Papas

Somber note: Kim and Kanye allegedly are only dressing North in black at the moment 

North has already clocked up more air miles than most children, and her parents make sure to maintain her luxurious lifestyle wherever they are.

According to the publication, Kim keeps 'at least' five strollers - the $940 Orbit Baby G2 Travel System - in key locales around the globe.

'She has one in Paris and New York, and she keeps one at her sisters' houses,' said the source.

To take things a step further, Kim and Kanye make sure North's all-white nursery, including her $3,950 crib, 'is replicated wherever they stay.'

'All of North's stuff is always waiting at the location they're traveling to,' said the source.

During the family's recent trip to Paris Fashion Week, North and her nanny allegedly had their own penthouse suite at the Le Royal Monceau hotel.

North also had her own chef during the stay. 'They use a local caterer to bring in food for North while she is in Paris. Kim likes Nori's food to be all organic.'

Fit for a princess: Apparently all of North's things are always waiting at the location the family travels to 

But North may soon have to share the spotlight with a sibling, if Kim has her way.

'Kim wants to be pregnant now,' said a source.

And apparently Kanye is hoping for a boy the second time around.

Said the insider: 'He wants an heir to his throne.'

No expense spared: Kim and Kanye treated their little girl to an extravagant 1st birthday party in June modeled on the music festival Coachella
