Middle school Principal Mark Hassell, 35, was arrested on Friday for allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl

A married middle school principal in southern California was arrested last week on suspicion of having sex with a 17-year-old girl. 

Police received a tip on Tuesday that Barstow Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Academy Principal Mark Lesley Hassell, 35, was engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a female student. 

Investigators interviewed the unidentified 17-year-old girl who admitted to having been in a 'consensual' sexual relationship with Hassell 'for some time'. However, under the law, the relationship could not have been consensual since the age of consent in California is 18.

In a press release, police said they found other evidence indicating the relationship, but would not elaborate.

With both sets of proof, they arrested Hassell on Friday and booked him into San Barnardino County jail on charges of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, sodomy, and oral copulation. Jail records indicate he was released on bail Saturday morning. 

The Barstow Unified School District has since placed Hassell on non-disciplinary paid leave pending the police investigation, according to a news release. He has also been told to stay away from all district students, employees and campuses. 

It's unlikely that the student attended the STEM academy, which only teaches fifth, sixth and seventh graders. 

According to online records, Hassell has been married since 2002.

'Due to employee confidentiality rights, the district is prevented from further commenting on this matter,' the district release said. 'However, the district will take any appropriate corrective action when the investigation is complete and facts are known.'

Hassell (pictured cutting a ribbon, center) was the first principal for Barstow STEM Academy, a mathematics oriented school for fifth, sixth and seventh graders which opened this past summer. Before that, he worked at nearby Barstow High School

Hassell was the first principal of the Barstow STEM Academy, which was founded this past summer as an institution where teachers and students would be 'thinking out of the box,' according to a story in the Desert Dispatch. 

Before that, Hassell served as head boys basketball coach and head coach of the girls track and field team at Barstow High School. He also worked as an assistant for the Barstow High School football team this fall. 

As the investigation is ongoing, anyone with information on the relationship is being asked to contact Detective Keith Libby (760-255-5134) or the Barstow Police Department (706-256-2211). Anonymous tips can be reported to the WeTip Hotline at 800-78-CRIME or www.wetip.com.
