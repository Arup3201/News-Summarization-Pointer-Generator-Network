Jersey Shore castmember Nicole 'Snooki' LaValle might not seem like the most business-savvy star in showbusiness, but the mother-of-two has surprised everyone - herself included - by selling out of a range of handmade merchandise which she created in the comfort of her own bedroom. 

The 27-year-old launched her own collection of personalized products, which included mugs featuring a variety of her favorite catchphrases from her MTV series, candleholders and bedazzled sunglasses, on e-commerce website Etsy last week, having spent weeks designing and crafting the items at home. 

And, much to her delight, her store, Nicole's Craft Room, sold out of all its products within just two days of launching.

Best friends forever: Much of the 27-year-old's merchandise features a reference to her best friend and Jersey Shore co-star JWoww

Business is booming: All of Snooki's products, including these two wine glass designs, sold out within just two days of launching

'EVERYTHING IS SOLD OUT!' the would-be businesswoman gleefully posted on her Etsy page. 'Getting Xmas orders out, open soon! Check back!'

It is not the first time that Snooki, who married long-time love Jionni LaValle last month, has ventured into the world of business, but never before has the reality star struck out on her own, having previously only collaborated with other brands. 

But it seems that DIY crafting has been a secret passion for Snooki for years - and she revealed on her website that she couldn't wait to get stuck into the creative process, particularly as it offered her the chance to create something truly 'personal' for her fans.  

'I [am] opening an ETSY store!' she wrote.

'There are a few posers on there pretending to be me and selling products! 

'You know how much I love arts and crafts and just the fact I can make my own crafts for my fans is just such a cool idea. 

'Like trust me if let’s say Jennifer Lawrence was making mugs in her room by herself to sell, I would buy them in a heartbeat. I would feel so awesome and special that I had a mug that Jennifer Lawrence made me, you know what I mean? 

'Everything is handmade and has my signature on it. I personalize the mugs, wine glasses and making candle holders, nursery signs for baby names, and more! 

'So stay tuned for more info on my store and how you can get some of my creations!'

Many of Snooki's signature items, which were priced between $15 and $100, featured an ode to her best friend and co-star Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley.

Her collection included a range of mugs and wine glasses bearing the catchphrase 'You're the Snooki to my JWoww', as well as a mug which said 'Best friend in the whole universe'. 

Surprisingly, Snooki's new husband, with whom she has two children -  Lorenzo Dominic, two, and three-month-old Giovanna Marie - doesn't appear to feature among the merchandise.

No doubt he will be hoping to make the cut when Snooki debuts her new collection, which she has promised fans will arrive shortly after Christmas. 

'Make sure to follow my store on Etsy!' she tweeted earlier this week, adding: 'I'll open up again soon! With new stock & new designs!'
