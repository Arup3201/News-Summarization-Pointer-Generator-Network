A World War II bomb has detonated in west Germany this afternoon, killing at least one man, and injuring several others.

The shock wave shattered windows within several miles of the site where the bomb went off, in the city of Euskirchen, and could be heard 16miles away in nearby Bonn.

The bomb, which has laid undetected for more than 70 years, is thought to be one of thousands dropped by Allied forces on the Euskirchen area in 1944.

Risky business: There are still thought to be hundreds of undetonated bombs in the area following the Allied drops in 1944

Small joy: Although many bombs remain, it is extremely rare that they detonate and cause injuries

Local residents took to Twitter to show the devastation following the explosion, showing shattered shop windows and broken glass on the streets.

According to Hardt, pieces of the bomb spread withing a one kilometer radius, however, no further injuries have been reported.

One man told Spiegel Online that all the windows had jumped out of the frame on his home and that the shock wave had dented his garage door.

It is not uncommon to find undetonated bombs from World War II in Germany, however they rarely result in injuries or deaths.
