It was supposed to be an exclusive fundraising event for the students of Scotland’s oldest university.

But instead, a wealthy reveller at the Oktoberfest at St Andrews ended up in court after he bit off the ear of a former World’s Strongest Man finalist.

Emanuele Ferrero de Gubernatis Ventimiglia bit into Jamie Barr’s left ear during a struggle at the event in Fife last March.

Mr Barr had been working at the event and had tried to prevent Ventimiglia, who was wearing lederhosen, getting into a taxi with his girlfriend after the couple had argued and she asked for him to be taken away.

But despite admitting biting off Mr Barr’s ear Ventimiglia – a descendant of the Fiat company founder – walked free after trial at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court. A jury decided that the 24-year-old Italian, from Turin but now living in London’s exclusive Knightsbridge, had acted in self-defence during the fight and found the charge not proven.

The St Andrews Charity Oktoberfest attracts wealthy and titled guests from across the world as well as hundreds of students.

Mr Barr, 49, told a jury he had once finished ninth in the World’s Strongest Man competition.

He had been working as a first aider at the Oktoberfest, at Kinkell Byre, St Andrews, and had been helping at a taxi queue at the end of the night to clear a backlog of revellers.

Mr Barr told the court: ‘There was a girl in the back of a taxi crying hysterically. She had her legs up trying to kick a guy away who was trying to get in the taxi.

‘I asked if she was OK and asked if she wanted him in there – she said no. I told him he couldn’t get in and he asked if I had a problem – he wasn’t happy.

‘I shut the taxi door and he appeared right in front of me. He put his head right against my forehead.  I felt him bite my ear and he came back towards me and scratched my face. I pushed him as he bit me then headbutted him and punched him.

‘Then I realised he had bit a large chunk of my ear off – they found it on the ground, it just looked like a bit of rubber.

‘I was taken to hospital with the piece of ear but they couldn’t re-attach it.’

The Quadrangle at St Andrews University: Mr Barr was working as a first aider at the Oktoberfest, at Kinkell Byre, St Andrews, and had been helping to clear a backlog of revellers at a taxi queue at the end of the night

Mr Barr told the court he had undergone a series of operations. A skin graft was taken from his arm to be stretched over the new ear cartilage and re-attached.

But Gordon Jackson, QC, defending, branded Mr Barr a ‘liar’ and said he had made up his version of events to paint Ventimiglia as the aggressor.

Ventimiglia, in his evidence, said he had ‘never been in a situation like it’ and was ‘s***-scared’ – and had ‘done the only thing I could’ to escape the situation.

He claimed Mr Barr had ‘aggressively’ hauled him from the taxi before attacking him – and that biting his ear was the only way he could get out.

Ventimiglia pleaded not guilty on indictment to a charge of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement, and lodged a special defence of self-defence.

A jury took just an hour to find the charge against him not proven by a majority and Sheriff Alistair Thornton told Ventimiglia he had been acquitted.
