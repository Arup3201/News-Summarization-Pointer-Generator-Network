Scott Kelly and his girlfriend will be giving a whole new meaning to the term 'long-distance relationship' when he sets off for a 12-month trip to the International Space Station on Saturday.

'For me it's like the most romantic long-distance relationship ever,' the NASA astronaut's girlfriend of five years, Amiko Kauderer, told ABC News.

Kelly, who has spent a total of six months away from Kauderer on previous trips to space, will be able to call her whenever he likes and will be able to video chat  once a week.

But they both know what they'll miss.

Long distance relationship: Astronaut Scott Kelly will leave for the International Space Station for a 12-month mission on March 28, leaving his girlfriend of five years, Amiko Kauderer, right, behind on Earth 

 Mission: The couple, pictured, said it will be tough but that they know it is for a greater good

'It's the human touch thing,' she told WFMY. 'We get to connect on phone calls. We get to have our face conference. I can upload videos. But you can't upload human touch.' 

Kauderer, 41, works in NASA's public affairs department in Webster, Texas; she has been with the agency since 1998. Last year the fitness fanatic tried out to become a Houston Texans cheerleader, but failed to make the squad.

Scott, 51, who has two young daughters from a previous relationship, said he will miss food on Earth as well as 'the rain, the breeze, the change of seasons'.

But 'most of my concerns with this flight, being gone for a year, is the stuff that can happen to people on Earth while I'm gone,' he told CBS Sunday Morning.

Still, the couple say they are more excited about Kelly's return home and what his record-breaking trip will achieve.

'We kind of really appreciate challenge and things that are hard, because we often know at the end of it, that you can kind of go, "Yeah, we DID that," you know?' Kauderer said.

'And the homecoming's really good after a year,' Kelly quipped.

Left behind: Speaking from their Houston, Texas home, the couple agreed they would miss human touch during the 12 months apart but were already looking forward to the homecoming

Family: Kelly said he also worries about being away from his two daughters from a previous marriage

Kelly, together with Russians Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, will launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in the early hours of Saturday.

The trip will test how the human body copes with prolonged space travel by comparing Kelly's health to that of his identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who will remain on Earth. 

Called the Nasa Twin Study, the Kellys will be subjected to 10 experiments in four areas: human physiology, behavioral health, microbiology and molecular.  

'Maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation, bone mass, bone density, those type of things, so, I am all in,' Mark told ABC News.

Still, Mark, who is married to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, says he has no intentions of consuming bland space-type food or working out and running two hours a day on a treadmill, as his brother will be doing in space.

'This is a chance in a lifetime,’ said Dr Craig Kundrot, the deputy chief scientist of Nasa's Human Research Program.

Close:  Mark Kelly, pictured left as he joked around with his brother after a news conference in the Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on Thursday, said he would not be eating the same diet  as his twin

'In this case we've got two genetically identical individuals and we can monitor what kind of changes occur in Mark in an ordinary lifestyle and compare those to the changes that we see in Scott.'

By staying on the station for 12 months, the astronauts will also provide key information on how an eventual Mars mission - estimated to last three years there and back - might play out.

A mission to the red planet will require long periods of time in reduced-gravity environments, both in space and on the surface of the red planet.

But, until now, crew members have only spent about six months on the Space Station at a time.

Kelly and Kornienko will spend 12 months in space, while Padalka will be there for just six months. They will travel there on the Soyuz spaceshuttle.

Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper from Moscow, will also leave a wife, Irina, on Earth.  His 32-year-old daughter is a new mother.

His wife cried when she learned in 2012 that he'd be leaving Earth for a whole year. And she's still not happy about it, Kornienko previously told the AP.

'She understands that it's a dangerous mission. But she's getting used to the idea,' he said.

On his trip, Padalka will break the record for cumulative time spent in space, which currently stands at 803 days, and will also become the first person to command the station four times.

The three will join Expedition 43 Commander Terry Virts of Nasa and his crewmates, Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa.

Scott Kelly

This will be the fourth spaceflight for Mr Kelly, 51, a former Nasa shuttle commander and Navy test pilot whose identical twin brother, Mark, also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996.

The two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results.

Scott Kelly's first two flights were aboard shuttles. He spent more than five months on the space station in 2010 to 2011. It was during that mission that his sister-in-law, then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly died after being shot in the head in Tucson, Arizona.

Once he's back home in Houston, Kelly imagines it will be 'hard to walk away' from spaceflight.

He'd love to pilot one of the new US spacecraft in development. 

But he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments, 'someone will run me over with their car.'

What will Kelly miss the most, besides his loved ones? The weather.

'It never changes on the space station,' he said.

'Even though it's a pretty nice environment, I guess it's like living in Southern California, people get sick of it ... after a while.'

Mikhail Kornienko

It will be the second space mission for Mr Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper whose helicopter-pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first Soviet cosmonauts back in the 1960s.

His father brought back souvenirs from the returning Soyuz capsules: uneaten food rations and pieces of the orange silky parachutes used for the final descent.

'Mom made gorgeous skirts out of them,' he said. 'I still have a small piece of one of those parachutes. 

'I cherish it as if it were something sacred.'

A religious man, Mr Kornienko is taking into orbit a folding icon depicting the Madonna and Child.

His previous station stay was in 2010, 12 years after his selection as a cosmonaut. 

He figures he'll miss the same things he dreamed about last time he flew: water not in the form of blobs as in space, but water you can swim in, as well as grass, forests and fields.

Mr Kornienko already says he'd take on another one-year mission — after a break, of course.
