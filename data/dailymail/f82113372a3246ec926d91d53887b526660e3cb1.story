Investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue, despite a grand jury decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson, the US Attorney General has said.

The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead 18-year-old unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.

The Attorney General also addressed the violence which has followed the St. Louis County jury’s decision saying ’it does not honour Michael Brown’s memory to engage in violence or looting’.

It's not over: Federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown will continue despite grand jury decision, Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Monday

Violent riots broke out in Ferguson late Monday night, and protests have been held across the country, following a grand jury decision not to indict white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of black teenager Michael Brown.

However, the FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson, and a broader inquiry has been launched into the police practices of the overwhelmingly white Ferguson force, which operates in a predominantly black community.

Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so. 

‘While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department’s investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,’ Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said. 

‘In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.'

Attorney General Holder added: 'Michael Brown’s death was a tragedy. This incident has sparked a national conversation about the need to ensure confidence between law enforcement and the communities they protect and serve.

'Though there will be disagreement with the grand jury's decision not to indict, this feeling should not lead to violence.

'Those who decide to participate in demonstrations should remember the wishes of Michael Brown's parents, who have asked that remembrances of their son be conducted peacefully. It does not honor his memory to engage in violence or looting. 

'In the coming days, it will likewise be important for local law enforcement authorities to respect the rights of demonstrators, and deescalate tensions by avoiding excessive displays—and uses—of force 

Federal investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution against Officer Wilson.

Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Officer Wilson willfully deprived 18-year-old Michael Brown of his civil rights. That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force.

The inquiry into the practices of the entire Ferguson Police department is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation.

The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that.

And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Michael Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson. 

The Attorney General said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office, a move which is expected to be imminent as Obama picked his choice of replacement earlier this month.

Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, 55, was announced as the President’s choice over two weeks ago, but needs to be confirmed by the Senate.

If she is confirmed, Ms Lynch would make history as the first black woman to serve as attorney general.

What other investigations are underway?

The FBI and the Justice Department are continuing to investigate the shooting for potential civil rights violations. Investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution. 

Whereas the county grand jury could consider multiple charges, Justice Department lawyers have a single focus: whether it can be shown that Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights. 

That is a difficult burden to meet, especially considering the wide latitude given to police officers in using deadly force. Some other past high-profile police shootings, including the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo in New York City, did not result in federal prosecutions.

What about broader allegations of racial insensitivity on the part of the Ferguson police department?

Beyond the shooting itself, the Justice Department is conducting a wide-reaching investigation into the practices of the entire department. 

That investigation is focusing on stops, searches and arrests and generally looking for patterns of discrimination within the overwhelmingly white department. It has the potential to require major changes in the policing methods of the Ferguson force. 

Such broader reviews typically rely on data and interviews in the community and can take far longer than a criminal investigation.

The Justice Department has initiated roughly 20 investigations of troubled police departments in the past five years, or more than twice the number undertaken in the five years before that.

And regardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, there's also the potential that Brown's family could file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson.

How long might these other investigations go on?

The Justice Department has not set a timeline for either investigation, though outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder has said he expects the federal investigation into the shooting to be concluded before he leaves office. 

He said late on Monday that that investigation was independent of the local probe, and that "we have avoided prejudging any of the evidence."

How will authorities deal with any protests?

President Barack Obama appealed for calm and understanding Monday after the no-indictment announcement, saying the country needed 'to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make.' Holder, too, said the decision should not lead to violence. Even so, within minutes of the announcement, crowds in the streets of Ferguson shattered windows, vandalized cars and taunted police while officers released smoke and pepper spray to disperse the gatherings.

In anticipation of the protests, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon pre-emptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Gun sales surged before the grand jury decision and some shop owners boarded up their stores. A federal law enforcement team has been working with top commanders in Ferguson and from neighboring police departments to help reduce tensions and build trust.

Are there longer-term efforts to deal with underlying problems?

Nixon several days ago named 16 members to a panel aimed at helping the community heal after the shooting. The commission, which will study underlying social and economic conditions, is expected to make recommendations in a report due by September 2015.
