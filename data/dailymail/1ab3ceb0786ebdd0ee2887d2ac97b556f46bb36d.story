Actor Seth Rogen has slated a film critic for suggesting movies such as Neighbors were partly to blame for Elliot Rodger's shooting spree in Santa Barbara.

The actor hit out at Washington Post writer Ann Hornaday who suggested in a recent article that 'outsized frat-boy fantasies' like the film encouraged the Santa Barbara suspect, who left six people dead and 13 injured last week in a deadly rampage after he revealed he was tired of being ignored by girls at college.

Venting his frustration on Twitter, Rogen called the article 'horribly insulting and misinformed', adding: 'How dare you imply that me getting girls in movies caused a lunatic to go on a rampage.'

Seth Rogen has taken to Twitter to blast Ann Hornaday, a film critic for the Washington Post, who suggested in an article that films like Neighbors were partly to blame for Elliot Rodger's shooting spree

In the film Neighbors, called Bad Neighbours in the UK, Rogen plays a new father who goes to war with the frat house next door after complaining about their constant partying

Judd Apatow also weighed in, accusing Hornaday of promoting herself using tragedy, instead blaming Rodger's killings on the fact that he was mentally ill.

In a column for the Washington Post, Hornaday asked: 'How many men, 
raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby 
arrested adolescent always gets the girl, find that those happy endings 
constantly elude them and conclude, “It’s not fair”?'

She conceded that Rodger had been mentally unstable, but added that his delusions 'were inflated, if not created, by the entertainment industry he grew up in.' 

Hornaday also attack Judd Apatow films, such as Superbad, for promoting fantasies of adolescents getting the girl which leads young men to feel 'it isn't fair' when their lives fall short. Apatow also used Twitter to criticise her article

Apatow accused Hornaday of using the tragedy to promote herself, and of ignoring Rodger's mental illness

Elliot, 22, who was the son of 'Hunger Games' second unit director Peter Rodger, detailed his chilling plans to murder women in a 141-page manifesto and in a six-minute video, in which attacked women for ignoring him and men for having fun a sex while he 'rotted in loneliness'.

Hornaday blamed a male-dominated film industry for promoting films full of 'violence, sexual conquest and macho swagger' which change harmless male fantasies into 'dangerous lies' which young men compare their own lives against.

Hornaday has been with the Washington Post since 2002 after previous stints at the New York Times and Baltimore Sun, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in criticism in 2008.

Superbad, a Judd Apatow film, follows three teenagers through the last weeks of high school as they try to sleep with popular girls by buying enough alcohol to get them drunk at a house party

In Neighbors (called Bad Neghbours in the UK), Rogen plays new father Mac Radner alongside Rose Byrne as wife Kelly, who move in to a new neighborhood only to find a frat house has moved in next door.

After Mac calls the police due to the fraternity's constant partying, the two go to war, trying to out-prank one another.
