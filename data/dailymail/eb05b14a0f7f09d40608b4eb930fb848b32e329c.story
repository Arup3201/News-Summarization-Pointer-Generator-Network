Authorities in Oklahoma released a mysterious ticket receipt signed with three initials as evidence in a 1981 murder  on Monday - as they continue to investigate the cold case of a college student who was discovered stabbed to death on her 21st birthday.

Victim Tracey Neilson completed errands on January 5, 1981 before returning to her Jamestown Square Apartment in Moore, Oklahoma, ahead of 12pm, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) said.

Neilson did not pick up when loved ones made birthday phone calls - and the Oklahoma University student's body was later discovered with multiple stab wounds by her husband Jeff Neilson at 5pm, according to the agency. The couple had been married for five months.

Over 1,500 leads were pursued by authorities as part of the 34-year investigation into the young woman's murder, OSBI said.

Though a single fingerprint was recovered by investigators, authorities have not yet found a match, the agency said. It noted that Jeff Neilson's family was part of a campaign to establish an Automated Fingerprint Identification System in Oklahoma.

OSBI said that a cold case initiative was launched, and that it has already completed new DNA testing on some of the evidence.

'For decades, agents have worked to identify the owner of a cable trouble assignment ticket book,' the agency said in a Monday release. 'The last ticket in the book is for work at Tracey’s home at 11:51 the morning she was murdered. On the bottom left corner of the book is a box for the employee name. We want to identify the three letters written in that box.'

OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown told FoxNews.com that authorities never found a motive for the slaying and that Jeffrey Neilson was eliminated from being considered a suspect. He was in classes during the day, she said. 

Brown also told FoxNews.com that witnesses claimed to observe a white male close to the apartment front door when the murder was thought to have taken place.

She told the website 'We believe someone came to [Neilson's] door. She let them in and that’s when the homicide occurred.'

The victim's sister Cindy Young told News9.com 'We've had to live with the fact that we may never know who took her life that day and we have to wonder every day why did they do that, how could they do that?'

'I'm begging you; please come forward,' she also said. 'Please just do the right thing because it's time. It's time to do the right thing.' 

OSBI says there is an $11,000 information award available, and that tips can be submitted through dialing 1-800-522-8017.
