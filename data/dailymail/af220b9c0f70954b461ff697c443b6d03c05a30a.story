When Sunderland manager Gus Poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box before picking a fight with Hull City boss Steve Bruce, it brought back memories of many a touchline scrap.

The technical area of the KC Stadium seems to have a way of bringing out the worst in managers - only last year Alan Pardew attempted a headbutt on Hull's David Meyler.

So, with Tuesday night's flare-up in mind, Sportsmail looks back at our top 10 technical area spats.

Alan Pardew swears at Manuel Pellegrini, January 11, 2014

The sight of a 52-year-old man calling a 60-year-old a 'f***ing old c***' seemed to shock many - and Pardew later apologised for his 'heat-of-the-moment' outburst.

A Newcastle goal disallowed for offside while Pellegrini's Manchester City were 1-0 up prompted the row between the two bosses and as the fourth official looked to separate them Pardew had a pop at his opposite number.

The FA 'reminded him of his responsibilites' - a bit of a let-off for the man now in charge of Crystal Palace.

Martin Jol and Arsene Wenger let off steam, April 22, 2006

For such a usually mild-mannered man, Wenger does seem to get into his fair share of rows with other managers - and on this occasion it was Tottenham's Martin Jol.

Jol's side refused to put the ball out in the build-up to Robbie Keane scoring an opening goal at Highbury while Arsenal had a man down. This infuriated Wenger, who was challenged on his views by Jol.

They were separated by the fourth official but Wenger still had to go back for one last pop at Jol - and he perhaps had the last laugh with Arsenal equalising and eventually pipping Spurs to fourth place in the Premier League by two points.

Jose Mourinho vs Arsene Wenger, October 5, 2014

These two have history dating back 11 years, and they still don't seem to get on to this day.

Mourinho's arrival in the Premier League back in 2004, when Wenger's Arsenal were champions, heralded the end of the north London club's annual title hopes - and Mourinho certainly has a way of getting under his opposite number's skin.

Just over 12 months after his return to the Premier League in 2013 and he was winding up Wenger again.

The Frenchman took exception to Gary Cahill's challenge on Alexis Sanchez in a 2-0 Chelsea win at Stamford Bridge and stepped into Mourinho's allocated area. Some verbals from the Special One saw the pair come face-to-face before Wenger pushed the Blues boss in the chest.

He later said he had 'nothing to apologise for'.

Kenny Dalglish tells Arsene Wenger to 'f*** off', April 17, 2011

The third of a Wenger trio of incidents - but on this occasion he was remarkably restrained.

Arsenal looked to have kept their title hopes alive at the Emirates Stadium with a Robin van Persie penalty eight minutes into stoppage time but Dirk Kuyt kept his cool to slot in a 102nd-minute spot-kick to level things and effectively hand the title to Manchester United.

Liverpool manager Dalglish wasn't too happy with Wenger's touchline protests and at the whistle after Kuyt converted he approached the Arsenal boss with his arms outstretched and shouted 'It's a penalty, p*** off!' before adding 'It's a penalty, f*** off!'. It's fair to say he got his point across.

David Moyes takes on Roberto Mancini, March 25, 2010

Moyes was criticised for his lack of results against big clubs but on this occasion his Everton side managed a win at the Etihad Stadium - and wound up his opposite number at the same time.

Both managers were sent off following a physical confrontation with Mancini trying to barge Moyes out of the way and then seeing the Scot square up to him. They were escorted down the tunnel by police such was the animosity.

However, the pair shook hands after being told they had to share a lift to watch the rest of the game from the upper tier. Awkward.

Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon square up, March 2, 2011

Old firm clashes always tend to be heated occasions, whether in the stands or on the field, but McCoist and Lennon extended the rowing into the technical area back in 2011.

Three red cards, 13 cautions and 34 arrests at Celtic Park told the story of the afternoon and McCoist angered the home dugout with something he said at the final whistle. The two squared up and pushed each other before being pulled apart.

McCoist got a two-match ban for his troubles while Lennon's previous record saw him take a four-game suspension, but the Northern Irishman would have been the happier after a 1-0 win.

Nigel Pearson's grip on James McArthur, February 7, 2015

Even a month on, nobody really seems to understand what was going through Pearson's head on the touchline at the King Power Stadium.

What started out as a jokey exchange suddenly became more sinister as the Leicester boss seemed to pin down the Crystal Palace midfielder by the throat as he looked to resume play with a throw-in.

The fact that Pearson had failed in a bid to sign McArthur a few months back added to the confusion.

Pearson appeared to grab McArthur around the throat and the floored player was seen mouthing 'get off me'.

Things got even more strange in the aftermath when Pearson dismissed the incident as 'light-hearted' and told journalists that he could 'look after himself' and then seemed close to the sack before eventually keeping his job.

Jose Mourinho's gouge on Tito Vilanova, August 17, 2011

It's a rare occasion that the Special One admits he was in the wrong, but he did here, which gives you an idea of how shameful his actions were towards Pep Guardiola's then-assistant.

During a familiar Spanish Super Cup El Clasico clash, Mourinho stole up behind Vilanova while a touchline row was already going on and jabbed a finger into his eye. Vilanova shoved back and both were handed bans.

'I should not have done what I did, obviously not,' Mourinho later said.

'The person who messed up there was me.'

Joe Jordan rows with Gennaro Gattuso, February 16, 2011

Recognised as two hard-nuts of the game, not many people were keen to get between Gattuso and Jordan as they rowed at the San Siro.

Having been beaten by Tottenham at home in the Champions League, Gattuso seemed to want to distract from the defeat by picking on the Spurs bench.

A fierce full-time shouting match between the two ended with the Italian grabbing the Spurs man by the throat before aiming a headbutt at him.

Gattuso got a four-match ban, but given Jordan's record as a player he was probably lucky Harry Redknapp's No 2 didn't have a go back - and the Tottenham manager admitted as much.

Alan Pardew headbutts David Meyler, March 1, 2014

Pardew, then Newcastle United boss, was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler at the KC Stadium.

With the Magpies 3-1 up, Meyler shoved past Pardew as he went to retrieve the ball for a throw-in - and the Newcastle boss was unimpressed, coming together with the Hull player and pushing his head into his face.

He received a £100,000 fine from his club, £60,000 from the FA, was given a formal warning by Newcastle and was slapped with a three-match stadium ban and a touchline ban for a further four games by the Football Association.

Pardew's punishment represented the longest ban for a manager in England since 1989 - and he also underwent anger management counselling in the aftermath.
