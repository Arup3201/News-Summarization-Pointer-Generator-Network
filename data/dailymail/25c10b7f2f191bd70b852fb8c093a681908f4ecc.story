Rising star: Eugenie Bouchard poses at an event during Wimbledon last year

Meet the new golden girl of tennis. Nineteen-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard has shot to stardom following her stunning performances at this year’s Australian Open tournament, and those in the know say the gifted blonde teenager has the potential to be the face of tennis for years to come.

In just her fourth Grand Slam tournament, Bouchard, the 30th seed and 2012 junior Wimbledon winner, swept all before her before going down in the semi-finals.

She now has her own dedicated band of supporters – known as the Genie Army – and marketers are jostling with one another to secure lucrative sponsorship deals.

Her agent, Sam Duvall, has no doubts as to how far she can go – he is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world.

'She's got the personality, she's got the game, she's got the looks,' Duvall says. 'She speaks two languages [French and English] and the crossover appeal is great. Aussie fans love her, French fans love her… she is very rare, let’s put it that way.'

Duvall told The Age that, in marketing terms, Bouchard had the potential to outdo glamour girl Maria Sharapova, the world’s richest sportswomen last year with earnings of $US29 million, according to Forbes magazine. Bouchard, he says, 'is the total package'.

Bouchard was born on February 25, 1994, in Montreal, Canada, where she still resides. According to her profile on the Women’s Tennis Association website and her own website, she has three siblings, including a twin sister; and the family lives on the same street as former Canadian Prime Minister Brian.

Her favourite singers are Justin Bieber and Jay-Z. She lists her interests as shopping, reading and swimming. Bouchard is close friends with British player Laura Robson and the pair often attend parties together.

For all her popularity, Duvall stresses that Bouchard has to keep level-headed and let her tennis do the talking.

'She's one that understands that the better she plays tennis, the more money and the more marketable and the more famous she's going to be. But it's all centred around the tennis,' he says, noting that Sharapova had already won four Grand Slam titles.

The last thing they want is for Bouchard to end up like 1990s icon Anna Kournikova, who was top of the marketing stakes back then but was often ridiculed because she never actually won a WTA title.

But already the marketers have been convinced by Bouchard’s potential. Word from her camp is that watch companies and global banks, among others, are bidding to secure marketing deals, joining the likes of Nike, her main sponsor.

The fans, too, are voting their approval. The Genie Army – who are usually decked out in the red and white colours of the Canadian flag - are a visible entity in the stands when she plays, and since the tournament began barely two weeks ago she has garnered another 80,000 'likes' on her official Facebook page.

Bouchard’s success at The Australian Open this year is in total contrast with last year, when she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. In 2011 and 2012, when she played in the women’s junior tournaments, she reached the semi-finals.

Before the start of the 2014 tournament, she had risen to number 31 on the WTA rankings, but following her win over 14th seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in the quarter-finals, she is destined to enter the top 20 for the first time.

Bouchard was bidding to become just the fourth teenager to appear in a women's Grand Slam final in the past nine years, but she fell to the fourth seed Li Na of China 2-6, 4-6 in their semi-final today. Nevertheless, the world has been put on notice: she is now a force to be reckoned with.
