Four bombings hit high-profile areas around Cairo on Friday, including a suicide car bomber who struck the city's police headquarters, killing six people.

It is the first major attack on the Egyptian capital as insurgents step up a campaign of violence following the removal of the Islamist president.

Nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of Islamic extremists who have increasingly targeted police and the military since the July 3 coup against Mohammed Morsi and a fierce crackdown on his supporters led by the Muslim Brotherhood.

The explosions struck as the country was on high alert ahead of the third anniversary of the January 25 start of the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsi's supporters had vowed to use the event to gain momentum in their efforts turn to a new momentum to ‘break the coup.’

Scorched: The blast shattered windows in the building

Friday's violence began when a suicide
 bomber rammed a car into cement blocks surrounding the main Egyptian 
police headquarters in the heart of Cairo, killing at least four people 
and sending billows of black smoke into the sky. The blast also tore 
through nearby buildings, including the renowned Museum of Islamic Art.

Egypt's
 antiquities minister, Mohammed Ibrahim, said the explosion badly 
damaged the facade of the 19th century museum and artifacts inside, 
including a rare collection of Islamic art objects dating back to 1881. 
He said the museum, which was recently renovated in a multimillion 
dollar project, will have to be ‘rebuilt.’

As
 a large number of ambulances rushed to the scene, an Associated Press 
photographer saw about six police officers weeping as they sat on the 
sidewalk outside the building. Small parts of a vehicle were scattered 
on the road and a blanket covered a corpse - which officers said was the
 suicide bomber.

Response: Hundreds of onlookers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics were at the scene

Alert: Major roads and places such as Tahrir Square have been shut off in case of further attacks

Several 
floors of the high-rise security building were wrecked, air conditioning
 units dangled from broken windows, and the pavement outside was covered
 with piles of shattered glass, pieces of bricks and rocks. The facade 
of the adjacent Islamic Art Museum and a court house were also damaged 
along with shops and cars in the area.

Egypt's
 Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim described the attack ‘vile terrorist
 act’ and vowed, ‘it will not discourage the police from continuing 
their fierce war against the black terrorism.’

The
 Interior Ministry cordoned off the building, which is located in a busy
 district, as rescue teams worked to extract victims trapped in the 
rubble. Security forces went on high alert, and closed the central 
Tahrir Square and main roads, including the one leading to the Interior 
Ministry.

The Health Ministry said in a statement that four people were killed and nearly 50 wounded.

Plume: Smoke rose over Cairo immediately after the blast

Shock: The explosion woke several people in Cairo, with hundreds posting about it on Twitter

About
 two hours later, another bomb struck a police car on patrol near a 
metro station near the Russian Culture Center elsewhere in Cairo, 
killing one person and wounding eight others, officials said.

A
 third, smaller blast targeted the Talbiya police station about four 
kilometers (two miles) from the famous Giza Pyramids but caused no 
casualties, officials said.

A fourth blast then went off late afternoon, killing one person outside a cinema.

The
 attacks came a day after the country's military and security leaders 
marked Police Day depicting security forces as national heroes battling 
terrorism.

The 
military-backed government has blamed the Brotherhood for past attacks 
and designated it as a terrorist organization. The group has denied the 
accusations as baseless.

The
 most prominent attacks were a failed assassination attempt on the 
interior minister in Cairo in September and the December suicide car 
bombing that targeted a security headquarters in the Nile Delta city of 
Mansoura, leaving nearly 16 dead, most of them policemen.

An
 al-Qaida-inspired group called Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, or the Champions 
of Jerusalem, has claimed responsibility for most of the recent attacks,
 saying they aimed to avenge the killings of Morsi's supporters in the 
months-long heavy security crackdown on protesters demanding his 
reinstatement and denouncing the coup.

A
 Brotherhood-led coalition had planned protests after Friday prayers 
across the country as part of their near-daily demonstrations against 
Morsi's overthrow and the recent vote on the country's rewritten 
constitution.
