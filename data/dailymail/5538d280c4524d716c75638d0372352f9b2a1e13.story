Rugby star Gavin Henson was ‘knocked out like a light’ during a drunken row with a team-mate.

The Welsh international, who was engaged to singer Charlotte Church, was drinking with nine Bath players in the city.

Witnesses filmed a team-mate, reported to be flanker Carl Fearns, who is 6ft 3in and 18st, squaring up to Henson before striking him in the face.

Knock-out: The moment rugby player Gavin Henson was punched by one of his Bath RFC team-mates in the city's Pig & Fiddle pub was caught on camera

Out cold: Henson is said to have lain in a daze for up to five minutes in the crowded pub on Wednesday night

The 6ft, 16st Welshman was sent sprawling to the floor, where he lay for five minutes.

His fellow players picked him up, 
dusted him off and sat him in a chair to come round. Police were called 
but did not attend after being told the situation was under control.

Henson, 31, is yet to play a game for
Bath after joining from London Welsh last month. Dan Atkinson saw the 
incident unfold at the Pig and Fiddle pub.

Caught on camera: Tempers flared when Henson was told to calm down by one of his team-mates, witnesses said

The 25-year-old waiter said: ‘They 
seemed like they were all having a good time, apart from one. Henson was
putting cash in his mouth and making the barmaids get it out, and 
generally being an idiot. One of his players squared up to him and told 
him to calm down.

‘There was a bit of a to-ing and 
fro-ing and then the other player just lamped him one. Henson was 
knocked out like a light for about five minutes.’

A spokesman for Bath said: ‘The club 
can confirm there was a minor incident in the city  centre involving a 
few members of the playing squad. We are investigating the matter as a 
priority.’
