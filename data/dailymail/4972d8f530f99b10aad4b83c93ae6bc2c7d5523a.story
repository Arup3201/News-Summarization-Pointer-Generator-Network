A pair of thugs who pushed a blind and deaf man and his brother on to train tracks in a 'horrifying assault' at a busy station have both been jailed.

Daniel Webster, 23, and Niall Martin, 24 pushed a 31-year-old, off the platform at Chelmsford station in Essex, then threw his brother Joseph down after him as he tried to intervene.

Martin admitted ABH on the brother and was given a nine-month sentence - but he has been freed already after he spent five months in custody, making him eligible for parole.

Webster was jailed for 22 months after pleading guilty to GBH and ABH against both brothers.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that the victim was attacked by Webster and Martin late at night on February 20 this year after the pair came over to ask him about train times.

A row broke out, and Webster launched his attack on the victim, who was described in court as 'profoundly deaf' and is registered blind.

CCTV footage from the station shows a second man trying to come to the aid of his vulnerable brother, only for both of them to be thrown on to the tracks.

As the pair scramble back to the platform edge and attempt to climb back to safety, Martin and Webster punch them both in the head, leaving them stranded.

Network rail staff were forced to put a block on all trains coming through the station over fears that the pair could have been killed.

Jailing the pair yesterday  Judge David Turner QC said it had been a 'disgraceful episode' and labelled their actions 'manifestly dangerous'.

He said: 'This is exactly the sort of thing that terrifies members of the travelling public late at night.'

Speaking afterwards, Detective Constable Alan Reed of British Transport Police said: 'This is one of the most appalling incidents I have investigated.

'Webster and Martin showed a savage disregard for their victims, and one of the brothers is still suffering from the injuries sustained to his foot.

'It is no exaggeration to say the brothers could have been killed after being thrown onto the tracks.

'I would like to pay tribute to the victims, who have shown great dignity following what was a terrifying ordeal for them

'I hope the sentence will provide them with some sense of closure, although in truth, the impact this has had on both of them is likely to remain with them for the rest of their lives.'

The court heard that the victim spent six weeks on crutches and was off work for six months.

He now walks with a limp and has been told the foot injury may take two years to heal and may need further surgery.
