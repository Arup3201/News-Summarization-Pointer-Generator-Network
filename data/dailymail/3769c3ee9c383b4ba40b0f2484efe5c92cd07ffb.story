With her aristocratic roots and royal connections, she could have been expected to insist on one of Glastonbury’s more luxurious accommodation options.

But that never really was Cressida Bonas’s style.

With a mystery man in tow, Prince Harry’s famously bohemian ex-girlfriend arrived at the festival yesterday ready to bed down in the mud with tens of thousands of other campers.

Roughing it: Cressie enjoys a drink with her friends. After pulling up at the site¿s VIP car park at 4.30pm she spent half an hour in her car plaiting her long blonde hair into an easy-to-manage festival style

Casual: Cressie, who rejected claims that she would be 'glamping' completed her relaxed look with an army-style green canvas rucksack slung over her shoulder and blue beanie

Given her determination to rough it, though, she should perhaps have given a little more thought to her outfit – turning up in immaculate white dungarees that were unlikely to fare well in the mudbath.

Miss Bonas completed her look with a black zip-up Adidas top and Dr Martens boots, and after pulling up at the site’s VIP car park at 4.30pm she spent half an hour in her car plaiting her long blonde hair.

She then entered through the exclusive hospitality turnstile just in time to see Lily Allen perform.

With an army-style green canvas rucksack slung over her shoulder, she strolled into Worthy Farm with her unidentified companion, who was rather more sensibly attired in wellies and a thick coat.

Miss Bonas, who split from Prince Harry in April after a two-year relationship, chatted and laughed with her friend and was seen sipping on cider as she made herself at home on the site.

The 25-year-old rejected claims that she would be ‘glamping’, or staying in luxury camping facilities, and said she was looking forward to camping with friends who had already arrived.

Fresh-faced: Miss Bonas, daughter of four times married and divorced Sixties socialite Lady Mary Curzon, said that she will be staying with friends who pitched up a tent

Cheers! Cressie sips cider with a friend, dressed in a casual black and white zip-up jumper. The festival was plunged into silence for two hours yesterday after a lightning storm struck

‘It’s my third Glastonbury,’  added Miss Bonas, daughter of four times married and divorced Sixties socialite Lady Mary Curzon. ‘I’m staying with some friends who have pitched up a tent.’

But whether she will regret that decision remains to be seen.

The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours today – making the mudbath on the 900-acre site even worse.

And the festival was plunged into silence for two hours yesterday after a lightning storm struck.

Organisers cut the power to all stages over fears the structures could be hit by lightning – leaving Rudimental’s performance on the Pyramid Stage cut short. 

In the mudbath: Their waterproof gear doesn't keep these girls dry. The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours on Saturday

While Miss Bonas was getting into the swing of things in Somerset, her ex-boyfriend was beginning a tour of Chile – and receiving marriage proposals from a woman by the name of Middleton.

Harry, 29, was on a walkabout when he was ambushed by TV presenter Bernardita Middleton, who was wearing a  tiara.

She said: ‘I am a Middleton – just like Princess Kate. I can be your next wife Harry?’

But unfortunately for this particular Miss Middleton, the prince simply smiled, laughed and moved on. 

A 26-year-old man who was hospitalised after taking horse tranquilliser ketamine at the festival died yesterday.
