A pair of brothers have come up with a way to have a high-flying holiday on a budget – by building a human catapult

Johannes and Daniel Schrieber had been looking for a cheap alternative to flying, so constructed a 1,100lb catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes. As you do.

Despite the device raising several health and safety issues, the brothers claim they have taken precautions, by getting clarification from the German Aerospace Centre.

Safety last: The 1,100lbs human catapult build by Johannes and Daniel Schrieber is seen in action at a lake in Frankfurt

Johannes, 26, and Daniel, 28, from Frankfurt, raised more than £700 through crowdfunding to make their 'budget flight' dream come true.

Johannes, an engineering student, and Daniel, a maths graduate, then spent ten months constructing the mammoth machine in their grandmother’s barn, using old bicycle tubes as the spring.

The contraption fires a person of average height and weight a distance of 40 feet, sending them about 16ft into the air.

Johannes said: ‘Daniel and I wanted to give people the chance to fly - without the need for a plane.

‘You might not get as far, but it will certainly be hell of a lot of fun.'

Up, up and away: To make sure their device was safe, the brothers had their catapult certified by the German Aerospace Centre

Mr Shrieber added: ‘All the research and funding was boring - but necessary - but now it's finished, the catapult is nothing but fun!

‘People can't really control what they do mid-air but more often than not they end up doing a somersault.’

To make sure nobody passed out from the G forces, the pair contacted the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology for clarification.

Johannes said: ‘Our grand uncle told us people passed out in war planes from acceleration and we didn't want that happening.

‘Fortunately everything's alright and nobody has died yet!’

Great success: Johannes and Daniel are pleased with their human catapult as no one has died yet!
