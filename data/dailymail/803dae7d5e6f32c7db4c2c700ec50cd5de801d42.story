Denzel Washington plays a heavy-drinking pilot who turns up for work after a night of partying in his latest box-office offering Flight.

But what seems like an exaggerated Hollywood plot became reality at London's Heathrow airport this week when a flight was cancelled because the pilot was believed to be drunk.

Romanian airline Tarom stopped the flight to Bucharest from taking off because tests suggested the pilot was intoxicated.

The pilot's condition was detected during routine checks and the airline has said it will 'immediately fire' him if official results prove the employee was under the influence of alcohol.

British authorities refused permission for the pilot to take off in the Airbus A318 from Heathrow on Wednesday morning.

The state-owned Romanian company said that the flight had been cancelled as a pilot was not 'physically fit to operate'.

A statement said: 'His medical incapacity was tracked down in London during routine checks.

'The pilot returned home on Thursday and we suspended him from activity until the investigation is finalised.'

'If official results we receive show he tested positive for alcohol, we'll immediately fire him,' the airline said.

Romania has pledged to sell a range of state companies under an International Monetary Fund deal, including a 20 percent stake in Tarom - which operates 23 planes - by August.
