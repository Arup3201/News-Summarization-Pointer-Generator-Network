Spanish Twitter trolls have made death threats against the chief minister of Gibraltar and his family during the row over border controls.

Fabian Picardo said he had been abused via the social networking site because of his criticism of the Spanish Government's actions, which have led to long delays at the border with the British Overseas Territory.

The chief politician in the enclave of around 29,000 people is the latest figure to be targeted online during the diplomatic row.

Conservative MEP Julie Girling, whose South West England constituency includes Gibraltar, has said she was called a 'Nazi' by trolls, who used foul and abusive language, and said she was 'too ugly to visit Spain anyway'.

Mr Picardo, who is married to lawyer Justine Olivero, with whom he has a young son, tweets from @FabianPicardo.

He said: 'I think social media is a great thing, but it also has a very negative aspect to it, which is people can use the cloak of anonymity to insult people and to say things that reasonable human beings don't say about each other.

'I have had some extreme reactions to things I say. I have even had death threats against my family by Twitter.'

Asked where they came from, he said: 'From Spain, in Spanish.'

Ms Girling said on Wednesday that she had received 'a series of deeply offensive and racist messages' via Twitter and email after suggesting British holidaymakers boycott Spain over the Gibraltar blockade.

She said one person, calling himself Javier, wrote: 'You are a Nazi Julie Goering.'

Another used racist language to suggest she should holiday in India.

She said: 'It may be that to be trolled goes with the job. However, the Spanish Twitter trolls aren't doing their argument any favours by trolling me.

'Their abuse shows they have no argument as they can only resort to the lowest form of language.

'The people of Gibraltar need our support. They will not be bullied by the Spanish Government or by a minority of the Spanish people. Neither will I.'

Economic engine: Fabian Picardo said he is in regular contact with local politicians, who wish to see an end to the stand-off

Spanish people living around Gibraltar support the British territory rather than their own government in the latest row over border controls, its chief minister has claimed.

Fabian Picardo said he is in frequent 'fluid' contact with local politicians in La Linea and other areas where the more than 4,000 Spaniards who work in the peninsula live.

Blaming the problems on the Government in Madrid, he said locals are supportive of Gibraltar as an 'economic engine' and want to see an easing of the border restrictions.

He also warned that the fluctuating blockade could directly impact the already struggling Spanish economy if it goes on too long, with construction jobs that would normally go to Iberian workers being awarded elsewhere.

Mr Picardo said: 'I have no contact with Madrid, but I have a lot of fluid contact with mayors in La Linea and others municipalities in the area who are very concerned about the effect the controls being imposed by Madrid could have on the working lives of people who come in and out of Gibraltar every day.

'So often ... the people of Gibraltar and the people of La Linea and San Roque become the whipping boys for what may be happening in Madrid, which might be totally unrelated to us here.

'The municipalities in the area are 
hugely supportive of Gibraltar continuing to be an economic engine in 
the zone and the free flow of people and goods to and from Gibraltar is 
an important aspect of that.

'For example, we expect to be putting up a lot of affordable housing in the next two years, we would bring in a lot of Spanish labour for the purposes of building that housing.

'But of course if they can't get across the frontier we will have to bring in labour from elsewhere.'

The Foreign Office is lodging a formal complaint with Spain over the latest 'unacceptable' delays at 'the border with Gibraltar.

Border controls: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called for a ¿50 charge to be imposed on people travelling between the two terretories

Officials are still considering a legal challenge to Spain over its imposition of additional border controls in the latest diplomatic spat between the two countries over the British Overseas Territory.

The Spanish action followed the construction by the Gibraltar authorities of an artificial reef which Madrid claims is designed to ruin fishing in the area.

The centre-right Popular Party Government of Mariano Rajoy, which is embroiled in a corruption row, responded by beefing up border controls and suggesting that a €50 (£43.30) fee could be imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving the outpost through its fenced border with Spain.

Downing Street has described the controls as 'politically motivated and disproportionate', saying they put Spain at odds with EU laws on the freedom of movement.

Mr Picardo said the delays at the border had improved since they were imposed but were still fluctuating between no delays and hold-ups of several hours.

A child chess prodigy was among the latest people to be affected, with reports that Spain's under-10 national champion, eight-year-old Maria Eizaguerri, was held up for four hours as she tried to get to a competition in Gibraltar.
