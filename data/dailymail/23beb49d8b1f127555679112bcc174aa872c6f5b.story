A mother who stabbed to death her three daughters was arrested by police covered in blood as she screamed: 'I've killed them all.'

Edlira Dobrusci, 37, was said to be in a confused state and had to be sedated by staff at a local hospital who said she also wounds to her wrists and neck - possibly self inflicted.

Officers and paramedics called to the scene spoke of seeing 'rivers of blood' as they tried to help the three girls aged, 13, 10 and 4 but they were all declared dead at the scene.

Neighbours called emergency services after being woken by her blood curdling screams at 6.30am local time in an apartment block at Lecco near Milan, Italy.

Police said the woman was separated from her husband and father of the children, and he had left her on Friday to travel back to his native Albania where she was also from.

He was traced to a relative's home close to the country's second city Durres and informed of the deaths and was said to have broken down hysterically.  

A police spokesman said that all three girls, named as Simona, Casey and Lindsey, had suffered multiple stab wounds and they had died in their own bedrooms but all the bodies had been dumped on the mother's bed.

Lt Colonel Rocco Italiano, of the paramilitary Carabinieri police, said: 'The whole apartment was covered in blood. There was nothing that could be done for the victims - they were all dead with multiple stab wounds from a kitchen knife.

'The woman herself was also covered in blood and in a very confused state. She kept screaming that she had killed her children. The husband and father of the children had left Italy on Friday and was traced to Albania.

'They had split up and he was going home to tell his family they were no longer together. They had financial difficulties but that is no excuse for the level of violence on three innocent children.'

An ambulance spokesman said: 'The mother was taken to hospital where she was sedated and also treated for wounds to her throat and wrists. It looks like they were self inflicted - she was in such a state. The flat was covered in blood.

'The blood was flowing like a river all across the apartment. It was a shocking sight as the guys involved have children of their own as well. She kept saying her husband had left her and she was in a desperate situation.'

Interior minister Angelino Alfano said: 'We will not let whoever committed this terrible crime get away with it.'

The woman was being held in custody accused of murder and was expected to appear before an investigating magistrate after confessing to the killings while being questioned by police.
