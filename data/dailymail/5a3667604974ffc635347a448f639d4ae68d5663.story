The 19-year-old Florida cheerleader arrested over her sexual relationship with a 14-year-old fellow female student has said she does not believe the girl was a victim.

Speaking from Indian River County Jail, Kaitlyn Hunt maintained the relationship had been mutual - even though the younger girl's parents claimed she was feeling threatened.

'I don't really feel like she was a victim,' Hunt told Good Morning America.

The interview came after she was offered a third plea deal on Wednesday after refusing the first and then losing the second after prosecutors allegedly found 20,000 text messages between the girls.

Speaking out: Kaitlyn Hunt, who has been arrested for her sexual relationship with a 14-year-old fellow female student, has spoken from jail to say she does not think the girl was a victim

Sadness: She admitted sending angry texts to the girl as she was upset about how she had been treated

Hunt has been in jail ever since the messages were discovered in August and the newest deal requires her to remain in
jail until December 20 and serve two years house arrest.

The 20,000 text messages allegedly included explicit images from Hunt and prosecutors said she tried to force the victim not to testify against her.

'The threatening tone... put her in a place where she felt she had to abide,' the father of the victim, who has not been named, told GMA.

But Hunt defended her messages, explaining that it had been a tough time for her.

'It was just hard - how everything came out,' she said.

If she sticks to the conditions of the deal, she will not be a convicted felon per Florida law. She would then have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years.

But under the deal, Hunt must plead no contest to five charges including two felony charges of interference with child custody.

The case
has garnered national attention as the teenager's supporters have 
claimed that the younger girl's parents only contacted police about the 
relationship because Hunt is gay.

She was charged with two counts of 
lewd and lascivious battery in February and jailed before posting 
$5,000. She was banned from contacting the younger girl, whom she had 
met at high school.

Under
Florida law, even if the relationship was consensual, it is illegal for
anyone over the age of 18 to have sexual relations with anyone under 
that age. At the time of their relationship, Hunt was 18.

'Threatening tone': The victim's father said his daughter felt pressured by Hunt's text messages

Arrest: Hunt was arrested again in August after prosecutors allegedly discovered she had sent 20,000 text messages to her victim since March, including some of a sexual nature. She has been in jail ever since

Third chance: Hunt, pictured in court on Wednesday, has been offered
a third plea deal which would see her in jail until December 20. She would then have to spend two years under house arrest

But court documents in August accused Hunt of 'covertly
contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to 
the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it.

The new evidence indicated Hunt and the 
girl, until July, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day
at Sebastian River High School in March.

Hunt also allegedly sent more than 25 lewd photos of herself 
which show her nude or 'masturbating while moaning'.

They
also allege that Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith, may have helped her 
daughter cover her tracks by messaging the girl, urging her to delete 
all trace of their contact.

According
to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend told detectives about the continued 
illicit contact and how Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location
where they would have intimate physical contact.'

New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her

On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship.

'F**k youâ€¦you're stupid,' she wrote. 
'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you 
snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. 
Bye.'

But the pair continued their contact - and Hunt's mother found out.

'Delete
EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete 
everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.'

The younger girl's parents have remained adamant that Hunt should be prosecuted as a sex offender.
