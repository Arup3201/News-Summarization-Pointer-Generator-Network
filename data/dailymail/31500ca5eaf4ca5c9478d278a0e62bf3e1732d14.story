Jeremey Lake's mourning father Carl Morse says he is willing to forgive Shannon Kepler, the off-duty police officer who killed his son

The father of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, who was shot dead by his new girlfriend's policeman father, has said he must forgive his son's killer after an open casket funeral was held for the tragic boy.

'I have to forgive this guy who did this to my son, I can't do it overnight, but I have to forgive him,' said father Carl Morse to his extended family at the end of the service.

The Tulsa, Oklahoma funeral was attended by around 100 people yesterday, after Mr Lake was killed by off-duty police officer Shannon Kepler, 54, on August 5.

Mourners flocked to Dawson Freewill Baptist Church as one man told Newson6.com: 'Jeremey was loved by many, many, people.' 

Mr Lake's aunt, Pam Wilkins, said: 'No attorney, no amount of money could get [Kepler] out of trouble, he will pay.'

The young man was shot as he walked down the street with his girlfriend Lisa Kepler, 18, who allegedly saw her father shoot him dead.

Her father now faces a first-degree murder charge, while her mother Gina Kepler, 48, has also been arrested for being an accessory to murder after failing to help police find her husband following the killing. 

Reverend Max Campbell wept as he spoke of forgiveness and salvation during the emotional funeral service, and spoke with Mr Lake's family, who crave justice but are also offering forgiveness to the Keplers.

Lisa Kepler did not attend the funeral, but told NBC last week: 'Jeremey is the kindest person.

'He is the most protective person and a good person who helped the homeless. I don't know why my dad did this.' 

Her father had never met her boyfriend, whom she had only known for a week. She had been kicked out of her home and met Mr Lake while he was volunteering at the homeless shelter she had been staying in.

Mr Lake changed his relationship status on Facebook to 'In a relationship with Lisa Kepler' on August 5 - the same day her father shot him dead in the street. Mr Lake met Miss Kepler at a homeless shelter where he volunteered and had offered her a place to stay after she was kicked out by her parents

He had offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, and this is where the young couple were going when her father shot him.

Kepler turned up in his car and shot Mr Lake two or three times. Tulsa police department spokeswoman Jillian Roberson said Lisa Kepler started to run and was also shot at, but the bullet missed.

The police officer  fled in his vehicle, but later turned himself in.

‘I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time,' Miss Kepler said to local paper Tulsa World. 

Formal charges have not yet been filed, but Mr Kepler is being held in Tulsa County Jail without bail and his wife was released after paying a $25,000 fee.

Kepler's lawyer Richard O'Carroll said that the officer plans to plead not guilty as he has a 'viable, if not perfect' defence.
