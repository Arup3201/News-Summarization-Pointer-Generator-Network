Misinformation about allergic diseases is causing serious consequences as some children are not being immunised due to misconceptions.

Australian experts attended the first allergy summit in Sydney on Friday in a bid to develop a national strategy to combat the escalating issue as one in five are affected by food, drug and insect allergies - and that number is expected to increase to one in four over the next 30 years.

Immunologist and Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy president Richard Loh said the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of allergies was frighteningly inconsistent.

‘Patients with an egg allergy are being incorrectly told they can't get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine,’ Professor Loh told the ABC.

‘And for over 10 years we have known that is incorrect.’

Allergic diseases are currently costing Australia an estimated $30 million a year.

Professor Richard Loh calls for a united approach

Some sufferers develop skin reactions or breathing problems while others can go into anaphylactic shock when exposed to food such as nuts, egg, milk and seafood which can be life-threatening.

Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia President Maria Said says allergies can perceived as trivial when they can in fact affect a person’s quality of life.

‘We have two-year waiting lists to see specialists and most of the people that end up in the room of a specialist really need to be there - they're not just people who have a transient rash,’ she told the ABC.

Both experts agreed there needed to be an urgent cohesive approach across all medical fields in every state throughout the country.

Prof Loh said an alarming one in 10 infants now suffer from food allergies.

‘Even simple things like the introduction of when solids should [be fed to] infants.

'There is conflicting advice,’ he said.

‘When you've got someone with a life-threatening reaction, you don't want to wonder “oh, which one is right?”.’
