This greedy chipmunk appears to have bitten off more than he could chew when he dug into a pile of nuts.

The animal had been among a group of eight that had been given the nuts to share.

But it seemed he was keen to wolf down as much food as possible.

Comedy cheeks: The chipmunk had been among a group of eight that had been given the nuts to share

Amused onlookers watched as the chipmunk gorged until his cheeks were puffed up to comedy proportions.

And just when it seemed he'd had enough, he returned for a second helping.

Daniel Parent photographed the extraordinary spectacle in western Ottawa, Canada.

The 51-year-old, an insurance worker from Quebec, said: 'About eight chipmunks congregated on the peanuts.

'Some appeared to be quite greedy and stuffed their mouths, creating this amusing photo opportunity.

'I
wasn't counting but I think some chipmunks easily got two peanuts in to
their cheeks, some of the more ambitious tried to get more.'

He
added: 'Normally the animals would just grab a peanut and leave but the
one pictured tried to take as many as possible while protecting the 
stash.

'It could have been because there were lots of nuts and lots of rival chipmunks.

'After
stuffing his cheeks, he ran off to store his stash and then returned to
get more. He only stopped when all the food had gone.

'I have never seen a chipmunk with his cheeks that full before. Normally they only take one at a time.

'They are such cute creatures and it was just so funny to watch them. People who have seen these images just love them.'
