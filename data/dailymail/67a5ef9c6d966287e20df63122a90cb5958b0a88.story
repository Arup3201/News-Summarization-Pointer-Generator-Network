Move over Spider-Man, there's a new kid in town!

Twenty eight-year-old daredevil Andy Lewis chose to perform a death-defying stunt  last Thanksgiving while the majority were tucking into turkey.

Nerve-racking photographs show him traversing a length of rope 400-feet-high in the Utah desert with his arms stretched wide. At one point he dangles from the cord upside down  by his legs.

Eventually he makes it to a central spider web-like platform, where he takes a well-earned break.

Real-life Spider-Man: Twenty eight-year-old daredevil Andy Lewis chose to perform a death-defying stunt in the Utah desert last Thanksgiving with friends while the majority were tucking into turkey

Walking the line: Some of the wire walkways - just one-inch-wide - were more than 200-feet-long 

Freefall: A man wearing a wingsuit can be seen leaping into the abyss

Lewis rigged a series of rope trapezes in the red rock last fall with the help of more than 50 friends and volunteers.

He named the finished creation the Mothership Space Net Penthouse.

The wacky installation featured lengths of rope attached to a center deck - which could hold up to 15 people.  

Some of the wire walkways - just one-inch-wide - were more than 200-feet-long. All of the walkers, including Lewis, wore lose harnesses to ensure safety.

Don't look down: Eventually he makes it to a central spider web-like platform, where he takes a well-earned break 

Team effort: The thrill-seeker rigged a series of rope trapezes in the red rock last fall with the help of more than 50 friends and volunteers.

Some madcaps chose to bungee from the giant hammock while others base jumped or skydived from it.

Video footage shows the thrill-seekers hurling themselves through a hole in the net and plummeting to the ground below before opening a parachute to land.

Recalling the event Lewis said: 'This was a massive undertaking and we totally rocked it.'

Brian Mosbaugh, 29, from Slackline Media, who photographed Lewis in action said that no one was injured. 

Mosbaugh has performed his own perilous stunts. In 2012 he tightroped across a thin wire thousands of feet up from cliffs in  Yosemite National Park.

He and Lewis meet in Utah every Thanksgiving to find new ways to get the 'blood pumping' through their veins.

'We all eagerly await this years’ gathering as history has shown the progression of these sports coming together to create quite the vertical circus of new achievement,' Mosbaugh added.
