This is John Hinckley Jr., the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades.

Clutching a bottle of soda in his hand and casually dressed, the 58-year-old enjoys his freedom on a stroll on Easter Sunday near his mother's home.

Hinckley is rarely seen since his incarceration at a secure metal health facility following the assassination attempt in March 1981.

Smirk: Hinckley took a stroll on Easter Sunday near the home of his mother, Jo Ann, in Williamsburg, Virginia

Freedom: Hinckley has spent three decades in a mental hospital. His family and lawyers have been fighting for his eventual re-integration into society

Mingling: A judge ruled last year that Hinckley can spend more time out with his mother, unsupervised. The judge said he must better socialize with locals in the area with a view to getting a job and making friends

Support: Jo Ann, 86, has been steadfast in her loyalty to her son and has turned mental health campaigner

But his appearance in public follows a court ruling last December when a judge agreed to increase the amount of unsupervised visits Hinckley Jr. could have with his mother, Jo Ann.

By being expanded to 17 days a month his family hope it will lead to his eventual release. But the judge warned that he still 'exhibits deceptive behavior'.

As part of a carefully monitored program, he is allowed to stay on an exclusive gated estate set among the lush greens of a golf course near Williamsburg, Virginia.

These exclusive photos are the first time Hinckley has been seen at his home since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the attempt of President Reagan's life.

Wearing a blue fleece jacket, cream chinos and black sneakers, Hinckley Jr emerged from his mother's detached home near the historic town. He passed several joggers who were completely unaware of his global notoriety.

As part of the conditions of his 17-day release he is also allowed to drive a Toyota Camry.

He has to carry a GPS monitored cell phone and, although unconfirmed, the Secret Service are said to watch his movements from a distance.

His 86-year-old mother has stood by her son since being locked away. She has spent a large part of the three decades promoting mental-health awareness and aiding in his rehabilitation.

At the time of the assassination attempt she said: 'We were dumbfounded. I did not think any of us would survive'.

Mrs Hinckley, who was widowed in 2008, agreed to allow her son to stay at her home as part of his eventual return to society. Neighbors on the quiet, tree-lined street rarely see her and she never talks about her son.

Trip: Hinckley was out and about again on Monday, driving away in this car. He went to visit a white-haired man. the judge overseeing his release said it was important for him to 'socialize'

When in Williamsburg, Hinckley is a regular customer at fast food restaurants near his home.

The young staff at his favourite Wendy's restaurant have no idea of the identity of their customer who usually orders a cheeseburger, fries and coke.

All of the servers were born at least two decades after Hinckley Jr's assassination attempt.

He was roughly their age, in his early 20s, when he became fixated with actress Jodie Foster, then one of the best known child stars in Hollywood for her portrayal of a teen prostitute in Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'.

A college dropout, he was living off an allowance from his wealthy parents John and Jo Ann who were based in Denver, Colorado.

In 1980 Hinckley learned that Jodie Foster was attending Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

He began to follow her across country until he was able to establish contact with her on two occasions.

Hinckley
 Jr. believed he could never establish a relationship with Jodie Foster 
unless he could do something that would draw her attention.

Chaos: On March 31, 1981, Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington DC. The president was hit under the arm and the bullet missed his heart by an inch

Infamy: Hinckley was trying to get the attention of Jodie Foster, who he was stalking after he saw her in Taxi Driver. Reagan joked to Nancy, pictured together here four days after the shooting: 'Honey, I forgot to duck'

Obsession: Prosecutors found masses of material which showed Hinckley's dark fascination with Foster, trial evidence above. In his hotel room in DC hours after the attack, police found a letter to her in which he wrote: 'There is a definite possibility that I may be killed in my attempt to get Reagan'

On the morning of March 31, 1981, he stood among a small crowd outside the Hilton Hotel in downtown Washington DC. Inside the President was addressing a union conference.

As Reagan emerged flanked by his security detail Hinckley Jr. opened fire with a six shot .22 revolver.

He wounded James Brady, a policeman and a Secret Service agent before his last shot ricocheted off the president's armor-plated limousine and struck Reagan beneath his left armpit as he was being bundled into the car by other agents.

The bullet penetrated within an inch of the president's heart.

One lung flooded with blood and Reagan,68, lost half his body's blood supply.

Doctors said that had the Secret Service not rushed the president to a nearby hospital as quickly as they did, he might have died.

A trauma team led by Dr Joseph Giordano was hastily assembled to receive the president.

As he was about to be put under anesthetic Reagan joked, 'Please tell me you're all Republicans'.

His surgeon Dr. Giordano, a Democrat, replied, 'Today, Mr. President, we're all Republicans'.

The operation lasted about three hours, and the President's humour continued when his wife Nancy arrived in the emergency room, telling her 'Honey, I forgot to duck'.

Hinckley Jr did not attempt to flee 
and was held at the scene where photographers and TV news crews had 
captured the pandemonium that followed as the shots rang out.

In the would-be killer's hotel room police found a letter he had addressed to Foster.

'There
 is a definite possibility that I may be killed in my attempt to get 
Reagan,' Hinckley wrote. Foster later said she had never heard of 
Hinckley Jr.

Brady was the most seriously wounded after being struck by a bullet in the head.

He
 was left paralyzed on the left side of his body and later dedicated his
 life to gun control by starting the Brady Campaign which has been the 
most vocal campaign to outlaw assault weapons.

Police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy recovered from their wounds.

Hidden: Despite his notoriety, Hinckley has rarely been pictured since his trial. Here, in this photo from 2003, Hinckley is pictured being driven to cour tin an attempt to be given greater freedom

Hinckley was charged with 13 offenses but found not guilty by reason of insanity on June 21, 1982.

Prosecutors had argued that he was legally sane and the verdict caused widespread anger among politicians and the public.

Several US states rewrote laws regarding insanity while in Montana, Idaho and Utah the laws were scrapped altogether.

Hinckley Jr was sent to the St Elizabeth's Hospital, a 300-acre site in Washington DC, where he was diagnosed with narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders.

In 1987, after applying to a court for home visits, his hospital room was searched and staff found photos and letters showing a continued obsession with Jodie Foster.

He had also tried to find the address of mass killer Charles Manson and became a pen pal of serial killer Ted Bundy.

As a result he was denied the chance for home release and his parents, who had moved to Virginia from Colorado, despaired that he would ever be set free.

But in 1999 a court granted him limited release to spend time with his parents, elder sister Diane, 61, and brother Scott, 64.

These ended up being revoked after he was found to have smuggled material about Foster back into his hospital room.

By 2005 he was granted permission to spend three nights a month at his parent's home after psychiatrists for the Government agreed his psychotic disorder was in full remission.

One condition of the release was for Hinckley Jr to see a psychiatrist once a week in Williamsburg.

In the last decade the amount of time Hinckley Jr. has been allowed out has increased as doctors said he was no longer a danger to the public or himself.

While at St Elizabeth's he struck up a romantic friendship with a former patient Cynthia Bruce. She has never talked about their relationship.

Last year U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman expanded the length of the home visits to 17 days a month.

In a 106-page report he said Hinckley Jr must show he can better integrate himself into the community and socialize with others in Williamsburg before a full release can be considered.

The judge wrote that allowing Hinckley Jr to have longer home stays could help him find a possible job and make new friends, adding he was satisfied he 'will not be a danger to himself or to others'.

But he stopped short of allowing a plea for him to spend 24 days each month with his mother. Friedman wrote that it would be 'unwise' to let Hinckley have more freedom without more evaluation.

He warned Hinckley 'continues to exhibit deceptive behavior even when there are no symptoms of psychosis or depression'.

Federal prosecutors had wanted a much slower release schedule and had pointed out Hinckley had lied about seeing two movies during one of his release periods.

The lies were only uncovered because Secret Service agents were monitoring his movements.

Hinckley's lawyer Barry Levine said his client was ready to be freed.

'John has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate that the conditions that existed back in 1981 no longer exist today,' Levine told the Washington Post.

'We think John is on a perfect trajectory moving toward unconditional release, and this is part of that.'
