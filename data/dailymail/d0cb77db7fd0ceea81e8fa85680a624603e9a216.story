Leading publishers Simon & Schuster are bringing out a book next month by former England rugby union international Brian Moore which many will regard as totally unsuitable for mainstream distribution.

The book, titled What Goes on Tour Stays on Tour, is former hooker Moore’s memories of rugby trips around the world with England, the British and Irish Lions and club sides. It is promoted as ‘good clean fun’.

However, the juvenile, obscene contents are anything but — with Moore describing in graphic, sordid detail his own and others’ sexual exploits on tour while he says the first rule of selecting a tour party is: ‘No c****, however talented.’

Worst of all, the appendix includes the words of a number of rugby songs — hugely demeaning of women and the disabled — that will certainly offend more than a few readers.

How Simon & Schuster could print the lyrics of Four and Twenty Virgins, The Sexual Life of the Camel and the Good Ship Venus is beyond belief. Both Helen Mockridge, publicist for the Moore book, and Ian Marshall, the sports editor responsible for commissioning it, refused to comment.

FA chairman Greg Dyke and UEFA president Michel Platini both received a £16,400 watch

FA chairman Greg Dyke intends to snub a FIFA edict and not return one of the controversial £16,400 watches gifted by the Brazil football federation to Congress delegates before the World Cup. FIFA’s ethics committee have demanded that the 65 watches, whose value far exceeds the allowed limits, are handed back to Zurich by October 24. 

But Dyke announced at the official FA function at Wembley before the San Marino game that having paid the £3,000 import duty himself, he intended to put the watch up for auction with all the proceeds going to the FA-supported Breast Cancer Care charity. 

UEFA president Michel Platini also said he would be keeping his watch to donate to whom he wished. But it is now understood he has given it back to FIFA, leaving Dyke making a lone protest. 

Meanwhile, Giorgio Crescentini, president of the San Marino football federation, is not the hardest name to pronounce. So it caused plenty of head-shaking at the pre-match function when Dyke failed to do so twice.

The FA’s attempts to make up for the late, great World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore (right) never receiving a knighthood now extends to a two-page promotion in the Wembley programme for England women’s game against Germany next month, saying the players are following in the footsteps of ‘Sir Bobby Moore’.

England Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison is just one of many senior personnel leaving sports management giants IMG since the company was bought by Hollywood’s Ari Emanuel.  They include Jeff Slack, head of football — a sport less central to Emanuel’s plans than golf and tennis — and Andrew Wildblood, who manages relationships with the R&A and the All England Club. Both Slack and Wildblood cashed in seven-figure stakes in IMG when the takeover took place.

KP’s let off the hook

Kevin Pietersen has had a relatively easy ride from his hand-picked interviewers this week. 

But it is understood BBC’s Garry Richardson, who asks hard questions, albeit repetitively, on his Sportsweek radio programme managed to really rile KP.

Meanwhile, the unseemly PR battle between Pietersen and the ECB this week is probably a high-scoring draw. 

But the ECB could have won easily if they had put up their employees Paul Downton and Andy Flower for questioning.

The draw for the first round of the FA Cup will be filmed live by the BBC in front of an audience at St George’s Park on October 27, with the event also covered by Radio 5 Live. However, such focus makes it all the more embarrassing that the FA have yet to secure a £9million-a-year sponsor for their flagship competition. The FA keep saying they have interested parties. But if no deal is clinched soon the heat really will be on the commercial department. There is still remarkable interest in the England team as the 6.6m ITV peak viewing figure shows for the San Marino game, despite it being a waste of everybody’s time.
