Tamara Ashley was in the middle of a normal phone conversation with her step-mother Kirsty Ashley, chatting about their kids and a trip Kirsty was planning to visit her in Adelaide.

Then her step-mum let out a blood-curdling scream.

Tamara tried to stay positive, telling herself Kirsty could have just tripped and fallen, but in her gut she knew something was wrong.

It was May 15 2012 and Tamara's father Darren Ashley had recently split from Kirsty after 16 years and two children together. She was in the process of taking out a domestic violence order against him.

Two weeks earlier, Kirsty, 35, had given Tamara, 27, her mother and brothers' phone numbers just in case anything went wrong.

Darren, 49, had always been manipulative and controlling, but in the six weeks since his split from Kirsty things had gotten worse.

'She'd ring me in the morning and tell me what he'd done day before,' Tamara told Daily Mail Australia from her home in Adelaide.

'There was always something he was doing every day to stop her moving on.

'She lost her job because he'd gone in and accused her of having an affair and her boss didn't want the drama.'

There was another incident where he had choked her, which made Kirsty decide to apply for the DVO.

On May 14, Kirsty was dropping her and Darren's daughter off at school in Alice Springs when she saw him waiting across the road.

He then tried to cut her car off with his motorbike. When she returned home to her brother's house, where she was staying, he was waiting in the front yard.

'I told her to go straight to the police station, and that night police went to his house to serve the DVO,' Tamara said.

The matter was due to be heard in court two days later, but that moment never came.

The following day, in the middle of Tamara and Kirsty's two-hour phone conversation, Kirsty noticed her dog Chino had escaped the fence and was wandering around on the street.

She thought it was odd, and went outside to get the dog, leaving the door to the house open and unattended.

Kirsty came back inside and they continued chatting for another 45 minutes while she checked her Facebook and they discussed the possibility of Kirsty and her daughter visiting Adelaide for a while to get out of Alice Springs and 'clear her head'.

Then Kirsty screamed and the line went dead.

'You can't describe that scream,' Tamara said. 'I tried to call her back but there was no answer.'

Tamara called Kirsty's mother who immediately raced over to the house.

'It was about 25 minutes before I got through to her mum again,' she said.

'She was just screaming saying "They cut her throat!"

'Then it's kind of a bit of a blur from there.'

Tamara's immediate reaction to her step-mum's murder was that her father couldn't be responsible.

'My subconscious said "That's my dad, he couldn't do this",' she said.

Weeks before the murder Darren had choked Kirsty, which made her decide to apply for a domestic violence order

'But when the police called me and asked me questions about where he could be, who were his friends, where did they live - I just knew then.'

Darren was charged with Kirsty's murder and two years later he appeared in Alice Springs Supreme Court.

In May of this year the court heard Kirsty was stabbed with six different knives, suffering 26 wounds including the slit to her throat.

Crown Prosecutor David Morters said some of the knives had the blood of bother Darren and Kirsty on them.

In June, Darren was found guilty and was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison.

In sentencing, Justice Jenny Blokland said: 'In the face of evidence against you it is very difficult to see how you could possibly have thought you could have fooled investigating police.

'Your attempts to deflect responsibility from yourself were childlike.

'It was a frenzied brutal attack, clearly driven by anger.

'It is a sign of the particularly grotesque violence that towards the end of the attack you drew the knife across the deceased's throat cutting her trachea.

'Despite weeks of evidence that established beyond doubt that you were the perpetrator, you appear to have a distorted view of, or cannot accept the reality of what you have done.'

Darren is appealing the guilty verdict.

Tamara says the verdict has a caused a rift in her family.

Her three full-siblings from her father's marriage to her mother and her half-siblings, who are Darren and Kirsty's children, do not believe he is guilty.

Darren was 32 and Kirsty was 19 when they got together. They had two kids of their own

'It's hard for me in the middle of all this because my siblings all believe he is innocent,' Tamara said.

'According to them I'm an outsider.

'Their son was only 12 when it happened and their daughter was 14.

'It's going to take a while I just have to take a step back and let them accept it.'

Tamara says she has struggled to come to terms with the death of Kirsty â€“ who she was closer to than her own mother and father.

'There was only 11 years between me and Kirsty, she was like my best friend rather than my mother,' she said.

'When my mother and father separated I stayed with my dad - I was nine and my mum left all four of us kids with him and I was upset with her so I chose to live with him.

'I look at family photos of us and just see those good times and then just try and override it with what he's done,' Tamara said

'Then of course Kirsty came on the scene and me and her just had this bond.'

Kirsty was a devoted mother and step-mother, a tomboy who loved drag racing and motorbikes and who worked hard running her own commercial cleaning business.

Every now and then Tamara's subconscious kicks in telling her her father couldn't have killed her step-mum.

'I look at family photos of us and just see those good times and then just try and override it with what he's done,' she said.

'The facts and evidence I know and I've seen just overrides it.

'Basically he's just divided the family in half, he's making us pay for his mistake.'
