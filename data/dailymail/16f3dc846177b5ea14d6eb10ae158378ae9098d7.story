I believe it is time to start educating Jack Wilshere after his latest smoking incident.

He needs somebody explaining to him how to behave.

If he was smoking that pipe, even if it doesn’t do him any serious damage as a player... well, I wouldn’t put myself in that position.

Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with something — cigarette, shisha, lager, anything.

Being in the team should mean so much to you, and is such a reward for all your efforts, that it’s not worth that risk.

Wilshere is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation — but you never are as a footballer. There is always somebody on the look-out.

You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that’s how you should want to live anyway.

Wilshere is still out injured, of course, and will be sad to miss a north London derby that has got all the makings of a cracking match. After beating Chelsea 5-3 on New Year’s Day, Tottenham will be thinking they go into the game as Arsenal’s equals.

Pochettino insists it is time for fans to get behind their forward ahead of the game against Arsenal

Mauricio Pochettino’s side will be confident, the crowd will be expectant and there will be greater belief among the players. But Arsenal put in their best away performance in five years against Manchester City at the Etihad — they were happy to concede possession and were clinical in attack.

I think they will go into the game with a better balance and if there’s any naivety in Tottenham’s play, Arsenal will punish them.

It’s the Merseyside derby as well this weekend and another of my old sides, Everton, got a vital win last week. There might be some momentum from that while Liverpool had a tricky game against Bolton and will have less time to prepare. 

For people to question Roberto Martinez’s position is ridiculous. He just needs to be more consistent. And there’s no better place to make a mark than in a derby game.
