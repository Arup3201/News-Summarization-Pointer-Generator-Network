When the earth caved in below the road, electricity cables were ripped out cutting off power supplies and making it impossible to see.

At least 43 rescue personnel and 16 vehicles were involved in the rescue effort.

The accident happened on the highway between the city of Simferopol in the disputed Southern Crimean Peninsula and the village of Nikolaevka.

A spokesman for the regions Emergencies Ministry said that it had been impossible for the driver to have avoided the hole as the road was unlit when it happened.

They said that the six who died had apparently been killed instantly after suffering massive injuries, and the reason for the ground had opened up under the road was currently being investigated.
