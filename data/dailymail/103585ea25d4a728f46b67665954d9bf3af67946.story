Buckingham Palace has played host to some flamboyant characters over the years.

So perhaps it was unsurprising that barely a courtly eyebrow was raised when transvestite potter Grayson Perry collected his CBE from Prince Charles yesterday in a midnight blue dress and jacket, heels, and fabulously over-the-top black hat.

Indeed, when asked about what Perry joyfully described as his ‘Italian mother of the bride outfit’, the Queen’s official spokesman replied with only the merest hint of a smile: ‘His attire was entirely appropriate.’

The Turner Prize winner became the first male cross-dresser to collect a gong wearing a dress.Charles got a fit of the giggles as Perry, in heavy make-up and a sweep of fuschia-pink lipstick, was introduced but the two were quickly chatting like old friends.

The prince couldn’t place Perry’s medal for services to contemporary art over his head because of the size of his hat, so handed it to him instead.

Perry, 54, who bowed rather than curtseyed, said he designed his outfit specially for the event, but first wore the hat ‘when I went away on a Transvestite Bridal Weekend’.

The artist, accompanied by his wife Philippa, 56, and daughter Flo, 21, said his outfit had been agreed in advance with the palace, adding: ‘They are pretty cool here.’

Or, as one royal source put it: ‘People would have been more upset if he had turned up in jeans.’

Speaking after the ceremony Perry said: 
'Receiving this was great, it's not just for me it's for all the artists
 - no really it's just for me, for 30 years of hard graft.'

Mr
 Perry, 53, once described Claire as 'a cross between Katie Boyle and 
Camilla Parker-Bowles' but when reminded of this he laughed and said: 
'This is my Italian mother of the bride outfit.'

He
 added: 'When I got the call my first thought was,  "What am I going to 
wear?" It's a serious thing, I'm not going to compromise my identity as 
Britain's pre-eminent transvestite.

'I Googled to see what people wore and went for the sexier end. I always do like the older woman who makes an effort.'

Other
 people who received honours from Prince Charles today included darts 
champion Catrina Gulliver, awarded an MBE, and comedy producer Gareth 
Gwenland, who was given an OBE.

Former
 newsreader Julia Somerville was also recognised, receiving an OBE for 
her work supporting the arts as a former chairman of the Government Art 
Collection's advisory committee.

Mr
 Perry, who grew up in Essex, made his name with hand-crafted pottery 
which is often illustrated with disturbing scenes of sex and child 
abuse.

He achieved widespread public fame in
 2003 when he was awarded the Turner Prize - the first potter ever to 
receive Britain's most prestigious arts prize.

At the time, the judges praised him for 'subverting the craft form of ceramics'.

Born
 in 1960 in Chelmsford, he began his career at Braintree College of 
Further Education and then at Portsmouth Polytechnic, where he studied 
fine art.

Mr Perry says he realised he was a transvestite when he was teenager, and was thrown out of his father's home by his stepmother.

Later when he moved to London in the 
early 1980s he began attending evening pottery classes and developed a 
strong connection with the medium.

He has said that he loves using clay because 'it is held in such low esteem in the art world'.

His
 pots are covered with subject matter such as child abuse, 
autobiographical images of himself, Claire and his family, as well as 
examinations of cultural stereotypes.

Grayson Perry, 53, is known for being both a celebrated potter and arguably Britain's highest-profile transvestite.

He
 was kicked out of his home as a teenager after he admitted that he 
wanted to wear women's clothes, but after going to art school in 
Portsmouth he moved to London and began his celebrated career.

Working
 in the unfashionable medium of pottery, Mr Perry struggled to win 
acceptance in the art world, but after being awarded the Turner Prize in
 2003 he became a national celebrity.

In
 the past few years he has curated an exhibition at the British Museum 
and presented a series on Channel 4, cementing his status as one of the 
country's leading artists.

Despite
 his outlandish image, Mr Perry has a highly conventional home life - he
 has been married to Philippa, a psychotherapist and author, for more 
than two decades. The couple have one child, 21-year-old Flo.

Mr
Perry, who grew up in Essex, made his name with hand-crafted pottery 
which is often illustrated with disturbing scenes of sex and child 
abuse.

In recent years he has produced a set
 of six huge tapestries to accompany a Channel 4 series he presented on 
British taste, as well as curating a British Museum exhibition in 2011.

Perry
 toured the country for the programmes, starting with Sunderland, where 
he made two textile pieces based on places and characters he found in 
the city.

Speaking at the palace, Perry said: 'I'm grateful I'm not one of these people who has sky-rocketed to fame.

'Some people say I've become a member of the establishment but I've been that for years. I'm an RA [Royal Academician].

'The
 idea that rebellion is at the margins of society - that's false, it's 
far more interesting to be mischievous from the centre.'

He lives in London with his wife Philippa, a psychotherapist and author, and their 21-year-old daughter Flo.

Among the other figures who were 
honoured for their contributions to society at Buckingham Palace were 
newsreader Julia Somerville and a heroic Gurkha who fought off a Taleban
 fighter with his kukri knife.

Ms
 Somerville received an OBE for her work supporting the arts after 
serving for 10 years as chairman of the Government Art Collection's 
advisory committee.

She
 began her career in broadcasting in 1972 when she joined the BBC and 
went on to present the Nine O'Clock News, before working for ITN for 14 
years presenting all the main news programmes and later returned to the 
BBC.

Newsreader: Julia Somerville was honoured for her contribution to the Government's art collection

Ms Somerville, 
whose role as advisory committee chairman came to an end last year, 
described art as 'one of the passions' in her life.

Speaking
 about the artworks that grace the walls of government buildings she 
said: 'It's a very comprehensive collection that's been going since the 
1850s.

'It comprises everything from famous classical portraits like Lord Byron... to works by Grayson Perry who was here today.'

Lance
 Corporal Tuljung Gurung, from The Royal Gurkha Rifles, was awarded the 
Military Cross for his gallantry and courage in Afghanistan.

The
 Gurkha was shot in the helmet by an Afghan insurgent, avoided being 
blown up by a grenade, then took the insurgent on in hand-to-hand combat
 armed with his kukri, the traditional Nepalese knife.

The incident happened when insurgents mounted an attack on the patrol base he was stationed in near Lashkar Gah last March.

He
 said: 'Everything happened so quickly but because we've trained so 
hard, that training takes over and you defend yourself. My rifle was not
 working so I could not use that, so I had to defend myslef with the 
kukri.'

Nine-time 
women's world professional darts champion Catrina Gulliver was awarded 
an MBE for services to her sport and charitable fundraising.

The
 sportswoman began playing aged just two and went on to dominate the 
game for more than a decade winning her world titles from 2001 to 2011.

She revealed: 'Prince Charles said to me, "Are you planning to retire?" and I said, "No, not yet."

'He also said, "Do you have to practice a lot?" and I said yes, and he said "At home?" and I said "At the pub."'

Television
 producer Gareth Gwenlan, who worked on a string of hit comedy shows 
from Only Fools and Horses to The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin 
featuring Leonard Rossiter, was presented with an OBE.

Other shows he helped bring to the nation's television screens included To the Manor Born, Waiting for God, and Butterflies.

Comic
 book writer Mark Millar, whose Kick-Ass creation became a hit movie 
starring Nicolas Cage, received an MBE for services to literature.

Another of his publications, Wanted, was also made into a movie featuring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy.

Mr
 Millar said: 'This is what everyone says but this is very unexpected, I
 do the job because I love it and any kind of award I just see as a 
lovely extra.'
