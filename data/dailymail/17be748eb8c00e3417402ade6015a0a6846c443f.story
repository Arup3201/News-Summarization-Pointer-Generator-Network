Down and out: Bob Ney's legislative career ended in disgrace in 2006, when he was linked to a bribery scandal and resigned from Congress

House Speaker John Boehner is hitting back at claims by a former colleague that he's more interested in women, golf and booze than his job, calling his book 'baseless and false.'

The book was written by Bob Ney, the former chairman of the House administration committee, was forced to resign his post after he was wrapped in a corruption scandal.

In Sideswiped: Lessons 
Learned Courtesy of the Hit Men of Capitol Hill - out this week - Ney 
recounts his life in politics and battle with alcoholism - and offers a 
harsh rebuke of Boehner.

The top Republican is described as 'a bit lazy,' and a man 'who was all about winning and money,' according to the National Journal.

The
book goes on: '[Boehner] was a chain-smoking, relentless wine drinker 
who was more interested in the high life - golf, women, cigarettes, fun,
and alcohol.'

Ney said
that Boehner's political life was spent mainly on fundraising and golf,
a pastime that Ney claims was 'non-stop' and 'paid for by lobbyists.'

In
Sideswiped, Ney wrote: 'If the Justice Department were ever to make 
John produce receipts for his addiction to golf just for the years from 
1995 to 2004, he would be hard-pressed to comply.Â 

'John got away with more than any other member on the Hill.'

Ney
said that he and Boehner were once close - bonded by their mutual home 
state of Ohio - and that Boehner offered support, even after Ney was 
slapped with corruption charges.

In response, Boehner told reporters today: 'This is a disgraced congressman who went to jail who's made a lot of baseless and false accusations to sell a book. It's sad.'

Ney was a Republican leader in the House who famously led the charge to rename French fries 'freedom fries' after France refused to support the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.

But his legislative career ended in disgrace in 2006, when he was linked to a bribery scandal and resigned from Congress.

Ney claims that Boehner told him: 'If you resign, I will personally guarantee you a job comparable to what you are making, and raise legal defense money for you that should bury... this Justice Department problem for you.'

'Because of Boehner's promise, I stepped aside.'

But it was a promise that the Republican would not keep, according to Ney.

Lamenting on Boehner's alleged double-cross, Ney wrote: 'I had been lied to and ditched.'

The Boehner camp is dismissing Ney's claims, calling them the desperate act of a man trying to peddle a book.

Michael Steel a spokesman for Mr. Boehner told MailOnline in a statement: 'This is a convicted felon with a history of failing
to tell the truth making a lot of baseless accusations to try and sell [a book]. More than anything it's sad.'

Ney's book is not just about Boehner, as he also lambasts George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, former Bush chief of staff Andy Card, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.

In 2007, Ney was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting that he traded political favors for pricey gifts and campaign donations arranged by notorious lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

He served 17 of them after his sentence was reduced while he sought treatment for alcoholism.
