Do no harm: Dr Richard Lenhart, 53, is facing a slew of sexual assault charges for allegedly abusing one patient for 17 years and another for seven under the guise of psychological treatment  

A former Pennsylvania psychologist has been arrested on sexual assault charges for allegedly practicing a special brand of ‘touching therapy’ on two female patients with a history of sex abuse.

Dr. Richard Lenhart, 53, of State College, has been accused of sexually assaulting two women, who came to him seeking help, under the guise of treatment and then billing insurers as if he had provided legitimate services, prosecutors said.

‘The charges state Lenhart prescribed “touching therapy” for the women, which included touching and holding the patients. The therapy allegedly included stroking, sexual contact and rubbing of genitals,’ state Attorney General Kathleen Kane said in a press release.

From 2008 to 2011, Lenhart submitted nearly 700 insurance claims seeking a total of more than $71,500 in reimbursement, falsely indicating he was rendering proper treatment, the attorney general’s office said.

Lenhart, who is married and has a 19-year-old daughter, is charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault and criminal use of a communication facility.

He is also charged with three counts of indecent assault and two counts of both insurance fraud and theft by deception. He is being held on $250,000 bail.

Lenhart ran a private practice out of an office on South Pugh Street in State College until his license was revoked in March 2013.

According to investigators, the 53-year-old doctor abused one of his patients, a woman named in the complaint as N.M., over the course of 17 years, between 1994 and 2011.

The second victim, identified by her initials A.M., was allegedly subjected to abuse from 2003 to 2010.

Private practice: Investigators say Lenhart touched his patients on their privates, got naked with them and watched pornography in his office in State College, Pennsylvania, where his wife worked as a secretary

The allegations against the veteran psychologist came to light three years ago when one of the patients complained about Lenhart's brand of therapy to the state Board of Psychology.

In November 2012, the board temporarily suspended Lenhart's license pending an investigation, which ultimately resulted in the revocation of his license.

A petition asking for Lenhart's suspension filed by the state Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs in 2012 detailed the allegations against the therapist.

According to the document, the woman identified as N.M. came to him in 1994 suffering from issues linked to severe childhood sex abuse.

The complaint obtained by CaseWatch.org stated that over the course of their 17-year relationship, the therapist 'groomed' the woman for sexual activity by holding her and rubbing her breasts and private parts.

Lenhart's ‘touching therapy' practiced on the patient eventually came to include masturbation sessions and oral sex in his office – just steps away from his wife employed as his secretary, according to We Are Central PA.

Lenhart 'informed N.M. that having a good sexual experience with him was probably the only bridge remaining for N.M. to heal from the trauma of severe childhood sexual abuse,' the document stated.

Disgrace: The therapist lost his license in 2013 after one of the victims complained about his treatment  

When the second victim, A.M., came to the psychologist in 2003 seeking help for anxiety, mood disturbance and a history of sex abuse, Lenhart allegedly developed an inappropriate relationship with the patient, which included watching pornography with her, ‘friending’ the woman on Facebook and sending her sexually explicit text messages.

The petition asking to suspend Lenhart's license laid out how the middle-aged married father allegedly told the woman that he was aroused by her, touched the woman’s bare stomach, and let her straddle him.

During their so-called therapy sessions, according to the complaint, the doctor and patient rubbed lotion on each other and lay down on the floor together.

The 53-year-old doctor also allegedly wrote love notes to the woman, kept naked pictures of her and gifted the patient one of his shirts to she would think of him when they were apart.
