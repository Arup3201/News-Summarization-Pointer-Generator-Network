Lawyers defending James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 and injuring 70 in a Colorado theatre shooting, will argue his conversations with police immediately afterwards cannot be used as evidence.

In today's hearing, Holmes' defense will argue that police did not read him the Miranda rights informing him that anything he says may be used in evidence against him.

The prosecution will argue that their question to Holmes before they read him the Miranda rights was legal under a public-safety exemption. Police say they asked him if he had an accomplice, according to Fox News.

Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 when he opened fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July

Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of
insanity for the mass murders in a crowded Aurora movie theater during a
midnight show on July 20, 2012. He faces 166 counts, including murder 
and attempted murder.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

It is the second week of hearings focused on what evidence will be submitted in Holmes' trial.

Some of the evidence in dispute comes from two dating websites where Holmes set up accounts before the shootings.

Prosecutors
say that in his website profiles on Match.com and 
AdultFriendFinder.com, Holmes asked, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

Prosecutors say they plan to use that to show Holmes knew the shootings were wrong, undercutting his insanity plea.

According
to the judge's summary of the arguments, Holmes' created the Match.com 
account in April 2012 and the AdultFriendFinder.com account just 15 days
before the shooting on July 20. Both were last accessed two days before
the shooting.

Evidence? James Holmes created a profile on a popular sex website just days before the massacre

Photos posted
to both accounts showed Holmes with the orange-dyed hair made infamous 
in his first court appearance after the shooting.

The titles associated with Holmes' postings on both sites were, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

Holmes
created the profile on AdultFriendFinder.com on July 5, just two weeks 
before the shooting and included a picture of himself with reddish, 
orange hair.

Holmes, who 
used the screen name classicjimbo included a cryptic message on the top 
of the profile which read, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

In his profile, he described himself as 6ft and single with an athletic body.

He
said he was a 'light/social drinker', however in the section where he's
asked if he smokes or does drugs, he answered, 'I'd prefer not to say.'

He also states his penis size as 'short/average'.

'A
reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted 
the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware 
would warrant prison time,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos 
Samour's wrote.

The judge 
also wrote that evidence from both dating sites could be used in the 
trial in relation to the identification, sanity, intent, deliberation 
and culpable mental state of the suspect.

Samour
overruled several distinct objections defense attorneys made in their 
attempt to have this evidence barred. That included objections about 
online dating posts' relevance, timing and the direct connection to the 
suspect.

The judge has already rejected one defense attempt to suppress the website evidence.

Bargaining: The evidence against Holmes is so strong he may accept a plea agreement before trial

Lawyers
for the accused have challenged the admissibility of 
almost all the key evidence in the case — from photos found on Holmes' 
iPhone to explosives seized in his apartment to statements he made to 
police after his arrest.

Defense
attorneys argue that investigators seized the evidence without 
establishing a proper legal foundation, initially entered Holmes' 
apartment without a warrant and questioned Holmes after he asked for an 
attorney.

Prosecutors 
contend the evidence was seized properly and that their methods were 
justified by ongoing fears for the public's safety even after Holmes was
arrested.

The judge's 
decision on the evidence could impact prosecutors' ability to argue that
Holmes knew what he was doing was wrong — a key element in disproving 
Holmes' insanity plea.

A trial is scheduled for next year.
