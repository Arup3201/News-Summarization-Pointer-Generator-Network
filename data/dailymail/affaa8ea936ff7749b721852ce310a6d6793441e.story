Doctors at Houston's Memorial hospital live-tweeted brain surgery on Twitter today, complete with graphic video, photos and up-to-the-minute commentary.

Beginning at 8.30 a.m EST, approximately 14 million people from Mexico to Australia followed the brain resection on an unnamed 21-year-old girl as Dr. Dong Kim removed a benign tumour from her posterior right temporal lobe.

A veteran of up to 300 craniotomies a year, Dr. Kim was involved in the team that treated former U.S Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords last year after she was shot in the head at point-blank range.

Dr. Dong Kim removed a benign tumour from a 21-year-old girl today and the operation was live-Tweeted onto the Internet

The surgery took roughly four hours from anesthesia through the surgery as Dr. Kim opened a two inch by two inch hole in the side of the patients skull and exposed the brain for 90 minutes as the neurosurgeon removed the tumour.

Interaction with the public during the surgery was provided by Dr. Scott Shepard, a neurosurgeon with Mischer Neuroscience Institute at Memorial Hermann in Houston.

The surgery was successful as Dr. Kim removed the cavernous angioma tumour from the 21-year-old girl's brain.

The social-media medical team put together by the hospital tweeted every step of the operation, opening up a little known field of surgery to the public.

The patient, whose tumour was discovered after she suffered seizures, benefited from the latest advantages in neuro-navigation.

Assisted by a MRI map of the brain, Dr. Kim was guided to the tumour exactly like a GPS would a car to its destination.

After the craniotomy removed the piece of skull needed to access the brain, the surgeon used the neuro-navigation to guide a microscope to take the offending mass out of the brain.

'Social media is a very powerful communications vehicle in helping to demystify the process of brain surgery,' said Dr. Kim, who performed brain surgery on former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

'So our goal of performing this surgery live via Twitter is to educate the general public about brain tumors and take them into the OR to see what happens during a brain surgery.

'Someone may have a loved one who is considering a similar procedure and perhaps they can glean some information from this Twittercast that may help them make a decision about whether surgery is the right choice for them.

'One neat thing about this is we should be able to get actual images of the brain surface itself,' said Dr. Kim.

'Hopefully you'll see video of the brain actually pulsating with heartbeats.'

Each aspect of the surgical process was dealt with, from the cold metal surgical instruments to the ultra high-tech neuro-navigation device.

Explaining that the anonymous patient would have no immediate access to extra blood because Dr. Kim deemed it unlikely the patient would need any, the surgical process was begun just around 10 a.m according to the New York Daily News.

Small snippets of detail were most illuminating, such as the fact that the operating theatre was kept at a relatively chilly 62 degrees Fahrenheit so that the surgeon and the patient did not overheat during the stressful procedure.

Warning all followers that what they would witness would be graphic, the live Twitter feed was nevertheless viewed by millions.

Followers were informed of the two separate preps undertaken before surgery by Dr. Kim as well as the fact that bacteriostatic agents are used to sterilise the scalp.

Even though the operation was described as routine by Houston Memorial Hospital before-hand, the hospital was keen to point out that the risks for brain surgery include infection, internal bleeding, stroke and seizures.

Handing out little kernels of knowledge throughout the surgery, Dr. Shepard reminded the Twitter feed followers that craniotomy is one of the oldest known surgeries to man, dating back to the Neolithic period where it was understood that drilling into the brain relieved built-up pressure.

Once the distressing sound of drilling was finished, a piece of skull known as the bone-flap was handed to the surgical nurse to keep it sterile during surgery.

Once the outermost fibrous layer of the brain known as the dura was peeled back then access to the grey matter was available to Dr. Kim.

Using a variety of precise tools, the accomplished surgeon removed the benign tumour and the team began to close the wound and to replace the skull fragment.

After approximately four hours the team wrapped up their surgery

As bone in the skull does not have to be encouraged to reform, the skull-flap can be simply replaced like a missing jigsaw piece and the nylon sutures used to sew back up the skin.

Just before the skull was sewn the team performed the second of two instrument counts just to be 100 percent sure.

Then the patient was wheeled into the ICU where she was woken up just 15 minutes after leaving the operating room.

Incredibly she will be ready to leave the hospital in only three days.

'The main reason I wanted to do this was for educational purposes,' said Dr. Kim to ABC news.
