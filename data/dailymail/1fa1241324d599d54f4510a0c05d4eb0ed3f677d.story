He's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action.

The 25-year-old Birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother Grace, who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of Mother's Day.

And like her Reds son, mum Grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the Kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables.

The duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a Sainsbury's Active Kids event at a school in St Paul's RC Junior School, Liverpool.

Daniel, who cooks his own meals every day, told FEMAIL: My mum is amazing, she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always.

'To spoil my mum I would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it, fish based maybe.

'Mum loves nice salads and especially avocado, so would definitely include that.'

For the challenge the Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa -  which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with Grace's home-made spicy 'Sturrcrazy' sauce, made to a secret family recipe.

The pair cook together when they can although these days it's becoming rarer.

Grace said to FEMAIL: 'When we can we like to cook together, but it doesn't happen so often these days, as Daniel lives away from home.

As the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal 

What was Daniel like as a child? 

Daniel has always been really active, he played football in and out of school. At home he would play out whatever the weather! Because of his naturally active lifestyle, he always loved meal times and eating Afro-Caribbean food. As our family were all sporty and active, it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. 

Does he still have the same tastes? 

Yes still loves it, amongst other things! But Daniel loves anything with spice to it.

What is his favourite food? 

I would say he has two favourite dishes, fish and chicken. The white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes, which is why he loves our family's Sturr Crazy sauce.

If he was cooking for you, what would he cook? 

Probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven. It's quite an easy dish to make and it's really tasty. He would probably make a side salad with rocket, tomatoes and lots of avocado, he knows I love avocado! 

What does Daniel mean to you? 

All of the family are so proud of what Daniel has achieved so far, he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream, as parents you couldn't wish for more than that for your children! 

But she still tries to get her family together at weekends.

'Every Sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical Afro-Caribbean lunch of spicy meat, rice and peas. 

'We love getting together and think it's important to spend that time together,' she continued.

Famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches, Daniel now incorporates as much nutrient-packed foods into his diet as he can.

'It's important for me to make sure that I eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously I'm training every day,'he said.

'I do enjoy cooking and I look forward to my dinner each night.'

His favourite meal to cook is 'salmon, kale, sweet potato, broccoli and quinoa' which he covers in Sturr Crazy sauce.

'I have it on everything,'he said. 

'It adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish; I even took some out to the World Cup with me.'

A typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein-rich foods

'Lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa, with perhaps chicken or fish [as] they are both great for recovery and full of protein,' he said.

'On the side I would have broccoli, spinach, lots of steamed veg. I also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day,' he continued.

So far so healthy, but doesn't he have any guilty food secrets?

'I'm pretty good with my diet to be honest, I love healthy food which helps and it is something I have worked on for years. But every now and then you need something sweet, which is fine, but all in moderation,' he said. 

And does he dance in the kitchen when he's successfully cooked a meal?

'Haha I leave the dancing for on the pitch,' he laughed.

Tara Hewitt, Head of Sponsorship for Sainsbury's said: 'It was great to see Daniel and Grace cooking together at the event; they clearly have a passion for great tasting, healthy food.'

Result! Daniel and Grace with the finished meal, spicy chicken served with quinoa and steamed veg 

Ingredients: Four chicken thighs (skin and boneless); 220g quinoa; four spring onions; one sweet red pepper; two cloves fresh garlic; four medium carrots; one broccoli floret; four spears of asparagus; black pepper, all spice, paprika; dark soy sauce; olive oil

Mehod: Season the chicken with all spice, black pepper, paprika and dark soy sauce and leave to marinate overnight.

Pre-heat the oven to 400*F and back chicken for approx 30 mins until golden and cooked through. Splash on some SturrCrazy sauce (or other spicy condiment) and return to the oven for five minutes.

Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and place on a high heat with a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil then turn down to simmer for 20 mins until steamed and fluffy then set aside. Whilst the quinoa is steaming, finely chop the onions a quarter of the sweet pepper, two cloves of garlic and pan fry with a splash of olive oil, pepper and season all. Empty and toss the cooked quinoa in with the onions and mix together, adding more seasoning if needed.

Peel and chop the carrots, chop the broccoli, trim the asparagus and steam in a pan for five minutes until tender before plating up.
