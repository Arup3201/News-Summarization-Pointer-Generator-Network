New dad: Simon Cowell arrives at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York this afternoon, posing for pictures

Simon Cowell wept when he was handed his newborn son on Valentine’s Day, it was revealed last night.

The X Factor supremo is said to be ‘delirious with joy’ after the birth of 6lb 7oz Eric Philip, who he greeted with the words: ‘I’ve waited all my life for you.’

A close friend of 54-year-old Cowell, who has chosen ex- girlfriend Sinitta to be the child’s godmother, said: ‘Simon was much more emotional than  he expected.

‘He was in tears as he watched the birth and broke down when Eric was handed to him.

‘It was such an incredible and emotional day.

‘Simon was by his girlfriend Lauren’s side the entire time. He’s besotted by the baby.

‘He told him, ‘‘I’ve waited all my life for you.’’ He said it was the best day of his life. He hasn’t stopped smiling.

‘When he finally left the hospital he went and celebrated with a Corona and a burger.’

Eric Philip, named after Cowell’s late father and his best friend, Topshop billionaire Sir Philip Green, was born at 5.45pm New York time (10.45pm GMT) on Friday, 17 hours after Lauren Silverman went into labour.

The source added: ‘The baby was handed to Lauren and then to Simon. The first call he made was to his mum.’

Sinitta, who has known Cowell since the 1980s, said she was ‘thrilled and honoured’ to have been chosen as godmother. Green and hypnotist Paul  McKenna are also expected to be godparents.

Cowell announced the news on Twitter, saying: ‘Very happy to say Eric was born at 17.45pm. Healthy and handsome. Named after my dad. Lauren in great shape.

Cowell tweeted the news mere hours after his son was born, confirming the child's name and the fact that mum and baby were doing fine

Thanks for all of your kind messages.’

He made a transatlantic dash after receiving a 5.45am call from Lauren saying she was in labour.

Baby
 Eric was born in the same £2,000-a-night luxury suite in Manhattan’s 
Lenox Hill Hospital that singer Beyoncé used for the birth of her 
daughter Blue Ivy two years ago.

A
 hospital insider said:  ‘Lauren checked into the hospital under an 
assumed name. The suite is spectacular. It has two bedrooms, two 
bathrooms and a sitting room.’

Silverman’s
 eight-year-old son Adam, whose father is her ex-husband and Cowell’s 
former close friend Andrew, will not see his new half-brother for 
several days. A source said: ‘He is on a pre-planned vacation with his 
father.’

Cowell wants his son to have an English nanny.

The
 source added: ‘Eric will be brought up traditionally. Simon will give 
him the best education his money can buy and doesn’t want him to be 
spoiled. He is hoping he will have an English accent.’

Smoker Cowell puffed away outside the hospital immediately before – and after – Eric’s birth.

He
 had vowed to give up his 20-a-day habit but later joked he was lying, 
adding that he was planning to install smoking rooms in his homes in 
London and Los Angeles. He has previously pledged ‘not to smoke around 
the baby’.

His spokesman 
last night refused to comment on reports that he planned to propose to 
Silverman, saying: ‘It’s too soon to discuss that.’

The birth was greeted with an outpouring of support from Cowell’s friends.

Sir
 Tom Jones spoke before  a charity performance in Los Angeles to say: 
‘You can have  a family and still enjoy being  in showbusiness. Simon’s a
 lovely fella.’

And Piers 
Morgan took to Twitter to share a photograph of Cowell and his father, 
saying: ‘A young Simon Cowell with  his father Eric, who he 
adored...lovely tribute to name his son after him.’
