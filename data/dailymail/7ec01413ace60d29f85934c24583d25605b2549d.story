Manchester United have snatched Monaco striker Radamel Falcao from under the noses of bitter rivals Manchester City.

The Colombian had looked set to join the Premier League champions, while Arsenal had also entered the race for his signature.

But Falcao is heading to Manchester on a private jet from Nice with a view to completing a loan deal.

Memento: Falcao was also wanted by Manchester City and Arsenal as both sides look to sign a striker

Earlier, Sportsmail revealed that Arsenal initiated first contact with the Colombia star's advisers on Friday, informing them of their desire to take the striker on loan, not a permanent deal. 

The Gunners have been quoted a £8.5million loan fee and a further £10.4m in wages.

City's bid to land  Falcao, meanwhile, was handed a timely boost after Alvaro Negredo agreed to join Valencia on Sunday night.

The Premier League champions have been offered the Monaco forward as have their neighbours United have also been handed the opportunity to sign the 28-year-old and the Old Trafford club are monitoring the situation. 

Falcao had looked set to join Real Madrid after posting - and then deleting - a tweet saying as much on Saturday night.

But Real boss Carlo Ancelotti instead moved to sign  United's Javier Hernandez on loan on a fast-paced day before the deadline in which Falcao appeared to be offered to a plethora of clubs across Europe.

Negredo will remain at the Etihad Stadium should City fail to sort a deal out for the Colombian.
