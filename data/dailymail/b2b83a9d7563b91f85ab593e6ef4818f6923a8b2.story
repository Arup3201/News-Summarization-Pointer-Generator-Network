Casey Stoney believes she is in the form of her life. Now all she has to do is convince England coach Mark Sampson before the women’s World Cup in Canada in June.

The former England and GB captain has only played once for her country since Sampson took over from Hope Powell 15 months ago.

Stoney, 32, is in the squad for the Cyprus Cup tournament, which starts on Wednesday with a match against Finland.

Casey Stoney (centre, pictured in July 2013) is hoping to worm her way back into the England fold 

The 32-year-old captained Great Britain during the 2012 Olympic Games in London 

The central defender, who has 117 caps, was voted players' player of the year at Arsenal in the last Women's Super League season.

She was left out of England's squad for the 3-0 friendly defeat by Germany at Wembley in November and was an unused substitute for the 1-0 defeat by the USA at MK Dons last month.

England face four games in just over a week in the annual friendly tournament in Cyprus and Stoney told Fanbookz.com that she feels she merits a recall.

‘My actual form last season was my best since the Women's Super League started,’ she said. ‘When I go away with England I feel I'm competitive and working really hard, so that's all I can keep doing. I'm delighted to be in the England squad and if the opportunity comes, hopefully I can take it.

‘I've played 117 games for England and kept clean sheets against the best teams in the world, so I know that I can do it. It's just a matter of getting the opportunity to show it.

Stoney has played just one game for her country under Mark Sampson, who replaced Hope Powell in 2013

‘This will be a good chance for the team to try different players and game plans but for me personally, with four matches in just over a week, this is an opportunity to play and show what I can still do.’

Steph Houghton, who succeeded Stoney as captain, and either Lucy Bronze or Laura Bassett have been selected in the centre of defence in recent games.

Stoney points to her best fitness results over the lose season, since recovering from a hip injury.

‘You can never lose what you never had and I was never quick in the first place,’ added Stoney. ‘I continue to work hard on trying to read the game well, understanding what's likely to happen. Getting good detail on the opposition allows me to feel one step ahead.’

England play Australia and the Netherlands in their other group games before finishing up with a fourth friendly in Cyprus. At the World Cup in Canada they face France, Mexico and Colombia.
