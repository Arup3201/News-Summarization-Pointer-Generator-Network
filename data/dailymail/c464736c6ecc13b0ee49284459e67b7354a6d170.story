Rupert Murdoch apologised for the 'grotesque, offensive cartoon' by Sunday Times cartoonist Gerald Scarfe

Rupert Murdoch and the acting editor 
of the Sunday Times have apologised for a ‘grotesque, offensive cartoon’
published in the newspaper, which has been described as anti-Semitic.

The cartoon, by Gerald Scarfe, showed
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu building a wall using what 
appeared to be the blood and limbs of Palestinians.

Published on Holocaust Memorial Day 
and carrying the strapline ‘Israeli elections. Will cementing peace 
continue?’, it was condemned by Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks.

Yesterday the acting editor of the 
Sunday Times apologised for the cartoon at a meeting with 
representatives of the Jewish community. 

Martin Ivens said: ‘You will know 
that the Sunday Times abhors anti-Semitism and would never set out to 
cause offence to the Jewish people – or any other ethnic or religious 
group.

‘Everyone knows Gerald Scarfe is 
consistently brutal and bloody in his depictions, but last weekend – by 
his own admission – he crossed a line. The timing, on Holocaust Memorial
Day, was inexcusable.’

In a statement Mr Ivens had said that insulting the memory of Holocaust victims 
or invoking blood libel was 'the last thing I or anyone connected with 
the Sunday Times would countenance'.

'The paper has long written strongly in defence of Israel and its security concerns, as have I as a columnist,' he said.

'We are, however, reminded of the 
sensitivities in this area by the reaction to the cartoon, and I will, 
of course, bear them very carefully in mind in future.'

His apology followed that of Mr 
Murdoch, who in a tweet, wrote: ‘Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the 
opinions of the Sunday Times.

'Nevertheless, we owe major apology for 
grotesque, offensive cartoon.’

In a message to the Jewish Chronicle, in which he denied the newspaper permission to reproduce the cartoon, he said he 'very much regrets' the timing of the cartoon.

He said he had not been aware it was Holocaust Memorial Day.

Jewish community leaders said they 
were disturbed by parallels they saw between the red-tinged drawing and 
historical anti-Semitic propaganda.

Speaking
to yesterday's Radio 4 Today programme, Stephen Pollard of the Jewish 
Chronicle said: 'I think you have to separate the difference between the
right to publish something, and whether you always have to be 
offensive.

'Clearly there was a mistake made in printing the cartoon. I think the cartoon itself is disgusting.

'Whether there is a right to publish 
the cartoon is a different issue, I think it was a misjudgement and News
International have handled it absolutely right by apologising.'

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission as his cartoon of 
Netanyahu was reminiscent of a blood libel – the centuries-old racist 
myth that Jews kill non-Jewish children to drink their blood.

The deputies said in a statement that the depiction of a Jewish leader using blood for mortar 'is shockingly reminiscent of the blood libel imagery more usually found in parts of the virulently anti-Semitic Arab press'.

Mick Davis, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, said he welcomed the ‘genuine apology’.

Earlier, Lord Sacks said the cartoon ‘whether anti-Semitic or not, has caused immense pain to the Jewish community’.

He added: ‘The danger of such images is that they reinforce a great slander of our time: that Jews, victims of the Holocaust, are now perpetrators of a similar crime against the Palestinians.’

Steve Bell, cartoonist in the Guardian, 
jumped to the defence of Scarfe's cartoon. He said: 'For once, this 
wasn't a bad cartoon. The problem with the state of Israel and the 
Zionist lobby is that they never acknowledge the crime of ethnic 
cleansing on which the state was founded.'

Mr Scarfe said: ‘This drawing was a criticism of Netanyahu, and not of the Jewish people: there was no slight whatsoever intended against them.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
