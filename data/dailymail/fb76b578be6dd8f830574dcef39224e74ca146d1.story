She was the baby elephant who was found guarding her mother’s butchered body after they were viciously attacked by poachers.

But, after time convalescing in Kenya’s only elephant orphanage, Zongoloni is ready to take her first steps to freedom and life back in the wild.

After months of care, Zongoloni has been moved to a reintegration centre in a protected area of southern Kenya, where she will learn new skills to survive in the wild at 'elephant school'.

Zongoloni was orphaned in September, when she was just 18 months old, after ivory poachers attacked her mother.

In September, poachers shot at Zongolini's mother in Kenya, and while a mobile veterinary unit tried to remove shattered 
bone and treat her wounds, they could not rule out the possibility of a 
bullet still being embedded within the bone. 

Two weeks after the attack, the large elephant collapsed and could not stand, leaving milk-dependent Zongoloni to guard her.

Her mother died shortly after, and Zongoloni joined
 a herd at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust’s centre in Umani.

She was taught new survival skills such as sleeping alone and finding 
edible plants.

After 'progressing well', she was moved to a reintegration centre near Chyulu Hills National Park at the end of June.

Over time, she is expected to become less dependent on her human keepers, who will remain with her until she joins wild herds.

Camera traps have found wild elephants visiting the new arrivals from the nearby National Park,  coming to drink from the new trough erected for the orphans’ use.

The move took place in late June when Zongaloni (pictured left) made the journey with two other orphaned elephants in Southern Kenya. There are four other orphans now living in the reintegration centre called Sonje, Murera, Quanza (pictured centre), and Lima Lima (right)

These interactions will hopefully help the orphans integrate into existing herds. 

Benjamin Kyalo, a keeper at the sanctuary, told MailOnline: ‘When the elephants first come in they are very traumatised, so we show them a lot of care, 24 hours a day.

We start to see a change after one month, when they start to play and swing their trunks.'

The orphans are led through the Kibwezi Forest by their keepers. The keepers gradually break the close bond they form with the baby elephants by leaving them alone for longer periods, or letting them find food and explore without help

‘The elephants make the decision to go into the wild when they are confident…[but] the gate is always open,’ he said.

Once on site, the orphans were given milk bottles before heading to play in a dust bath, (Lima Lima is pictured) and then exploring the surrounding forest. The keepers said the orphans are gradually adapting to their new environment, and as the days pass, are confident they'll be in the wild before the end of the year
