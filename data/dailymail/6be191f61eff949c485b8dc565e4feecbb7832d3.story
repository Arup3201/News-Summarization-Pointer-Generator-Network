The chief of the Pakistani Taliban who had a $5 million bounty on his head has been killed in an American drone strike.

Hakimullah Mehsud, thought to have been behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and several attacks inside Pakistan, is one of five believed dead in the attack this morning.

The attack and his death were confirmed by senior Taliban commanders, who said they saw Mehsud's body, and U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources.

It is believed the men were killed in a U.S. drone strike on Mehsud's car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, in the north west of Pakistan.

Reports said Mehsud led the violent militant group from a secret hideout in the tribal region, which is one of the Taliban's main strongholds.

Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, a village about three miles from the regional capital of Miranshah, sources said.

Two of the dead reportedly included Hakimullah's personal bodyguard Tariq Mehsud and his driver Abdullah Mehsud.

A senior Taliban commander said: 'We confirm with great sorrow that our esteemed leader was martyred in a drone attack.'

Mehsud took over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban in August 2009 after his predecessor was also killed in a drone attack.

Since then he has been one of the CIA's most wanted men with a $5 million bounty on his head.

He appeared in a farewell video for a Jordanian double agent whose suicide bombing in 2009 killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan.

The U.S. named him 'the self-proclaimed emir of the Pakistani Taliban' and charged him with conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens abroad and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.

His funeral will be held tomorrow in Miranshah, the Taliban commander said - which is likely to stir tensions further in the highly volatile region.

Today's drone strike came amid peace talks between the Pakistani government and militants in the region to end years of fighting.

Unconfirmed reports say the strike came as Mehsud attended a gathering of 25 Taliban leaders to discuss the government's offer of peace.

During
 a visit to London yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won a landslide election victory in May, confirmed talks with the Pakistani Taliban had started.

The Pakistani government condemned today's drone strike, although their statement was issued before Mehsud's death was reported.

Controversial: Taliban leaders have already described Hakimullah Mehsud as a martyr

'These
 strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity,' said a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The drone strikes are unpopular in Pakistan, 
where many people view them as an infringement on Pakistani sovereignty 
and say innocent civilians are killed in the process.

But the Americans have had some successes - in May, a drone strike killed Mehsud's second-in-command, and one of his most trusted lieutenants was captured in Afghanistan last month.

The CIA and the White House declined to comment on Mehsud's death.

Although the killing will spark calls for revenge among Taliban leaders, it may make negotiations with the militants easier in the long-run, said Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center.

He said: 'Hakimullah Mehsud was a very controversial figure and he had very tough demands.'

Mehsud, who told jokes and had an interest in modern technology, was the driver for the former head of the Pakistani Taliban before rising through the ranks.

The militant leader, known for his emotional outbursts, had two wives but moved frequently because of his fear of U.S. drone strikes.

His wing of the Taliban was accused of being involved in an attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square in 2010.

But recently Mehsud's rivalries with other Taliban commanders over the spoils from extortion and kidnapping had sharpened, it is believed, raising tensions within the armed organisation.
