A woman has pleaded not guilty to trespassing charges after she got onto a runway at San Francisco International Airport with plans to stow away on a jet bound for Central America.

Prosecutors say Adriana Anabela Monterroso-Santos allegedly walked on a runway Wednesday and waved her arms at a plane.

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says the 42-year-old woman was living in a homeless shelter near the airport.

A woman has pled guilty to trespassing after being caught on this San Francisco airport runway in an attempt to stow away on a jet

'If she needs help, we’ll steer her in the right direction,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle.  

Wagstaffe said he incident has highlighted a potential security lapse.

'The real concern should be how she got out onto a runway, not why?' he said. 'If she can do it, what is stopping a terrorist from doing the same thing?'  

Wagstaffe says the woman told authorities she was hoping to hide in the cargo hold of a jet headed to her home country of Guatemala.

She told officials she got the idea after hearing about the Santa Clara teenager who survived a five-hour flight from San Jose to Maui in the wheel well of a jet.
