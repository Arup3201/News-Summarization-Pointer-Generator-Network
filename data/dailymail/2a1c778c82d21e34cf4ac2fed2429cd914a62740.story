Encased within a plastic isolation chamber, Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo lands on home soil after being struck down with Ebola while helping victims in Sierra Leone.

The priest, a medical director of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, was infected with the deadly disease as he tended to victims in the Western city of Lunsar.

And today, dramatic images of the missionary being unloaded from a Spanish military transport plane at Torrejon de Ardoz Air Base in Madrid were released, laying bare how fearful even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease.

In scenes that would not feel out of place in a science-fiction movie set in space, Mr Viejo was wheeled by doctors dressed from head to toe in protective bio-hazard suits to a Madrid hospital where they will battle to save his life.

Life-threatening: He is the second Spanish priest to be diagnosed with Ebola after Miguel Pajares, also a member of San Juan de Dios, who died last month days after being brought back to Spain from Liberia

Surrounded by doctors dressed from head to toe in protective hazard suits, Mr Veijo is stretchered off the flight in Madrid. These dramatic images lay bare quite how fearful  even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease

He is the second Spanish priest to be diagnosed with Ebola after Miguel Pajares, also a member of San Juan de Dios, died last month days after being brought back to Spain from Liberia. 

Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's controversial Ebola lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for, according to the authorities, who said they may repeat the campaign.

Most of the west African country's six million people were confined to their homes for 72 hours from Friday, as 30,000 volunteers went from door to door to educate residents on preventing the spread of the deadly epidemic.

The crack down came as it emerged many families in the country are conducting secret 'night burials' of victims - clandestine funeral services held under cover of darkness to conceal the fact that there had been an Ebola patient in the household.

The country's controversial Ebola lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for

Not only is that making it increasingly difficult for authorities to record an accurate death toll for the the worst outbreak of the disease on record, but it is also seriously damaging Sierra Leone's ability to prevent its spread. The World Health Organisation says the virus has already killed more than 562 people in the country.

'We have an overflow of bodies which we still need to bury but this has been an everyday occurrence since the Ebola outbreak ... Now at least we have about 150 new cases,' Steven Gaojia, head of the country's emergency operation centre, said late last night.

The country's chief medical officer earlier said up to 70 bodies had been uncovered, but these were in and around the capital, and results for the whole country are likely to push up the figures significantly.

Health Minister Abubakarr Fofanah told AFP volunteers had managed to reach around 80 percent of homes, deeming the action a success.

'We have learnt a lot from the campaign. Although this campaign has ended, there is a possibility we would have a similar one some other time,' he said.

'I cannot as of now give you statistics about the total corpses collected during the three-day period as we are now awaiting returns from other parts of the country and this will be made known as soon as the full report is compiled.' 

It comes as it was revealed an official team burying Ebola victims was attacked in Sierra Leone's capital on Saturday.

The attack on the burial team on Saturday occurred in the village of Matainkay, some three miles from  Freetown.

Panic: Liberia's government says it is desperate to cut down on 'night burials' - funeral services held within families trying to conceal the fact that there had been an Ebola patient in the household

Liberian nurses carry a suspected Ebola patient into the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia. 

Local MP Claude Kamanda said that armed policemen accompanying the burial team quickly arrived, causing the attackers to flee.

But the attack represents the huge challenge faced by governments in the region who are desperately trying to stamp out the disease in the face of widespread fears, misinformation and stigma among residents of the affected countries.

A day earlier, it emerged eight bodies, including those of three journalists, were found after an attack on a team trying to educate locals on the risks of the Ebola virus in a remote part of neighbouring Guinea.

'The eight bodies were found in the village latrine. Three of them had their throats slit,' government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said.

Guinea's Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana, speaking earlier, said six people were arrested following the incident, which took place on Tuesday in Wome, a village close to the town of Nzerekore, in Guinea's southeast, where Ebola was first identified in March.

Ebola has infected at least 5,357 people in West Africa this year, mainly in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, killing 2,630 of those, according to the World Health Organization.
