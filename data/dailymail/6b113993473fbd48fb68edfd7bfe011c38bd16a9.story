It took just 20 minutes to turn this street in NSW's Blue Mountains into a graveyard of ash and rubble when an inferno tore through nine months ago.  

Buena Vista Road in Winmalee, 80km west of Sydney, lost 42 homes when the worst fires in the state's history destroyed everything in its path.

But the burnt out blocks that once resembled something 'from a war-torn country' have now been transformed into construction sites as families pick up the pieces and start to rebuild their homes and lives.

Christie Daschke and her husband Jake are rebuilding their home after they lost everything when fire tore through their Blue Mountains street nine months ago

Blue Mountains Council has received 143 development-related applications for bushfire affected homes since fires swept through Winmalee, Springwood and Yellow Rock on October 17, 2013.

The cost of the rebuild is already at roughly $44.26 million after 185 houses were destroyed and a further 132 were damaged.

At least 10 houses are now under construction in Buena Vista Road – the street visited by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during the royal tour in April.

Alan Seaman built his house when he and his wife Jocelyn moved to Winmalee 42 years ago and now, at 72 years of age, he is building their family home for a second time.

'We raised our family of three boys here,' Ms Seaman told Daily Mail Australia.

'We were the second house in the street back then and Alan built it virtually himself. So there was no question about it, we were going to rebuild.

'Alan would never let just anyone build our home, so he's doing it again with the help of our son.'

Mr Seaman is slowly starting to rebuild and while the couple have tried to remain optimistic, the reality of their loss is still hard to deal with.

Many families were left with nothing when the fire tore through and the cost of the rebuild across the Blue Mountains is already at roughly $44.26 million

'It was a two-storey house but when we came back after the fires it was flat. We're only building a single-storey with four bedrooms this time,' Ms Seaman said.

'I just can't get excited about it, if I can be honest. I can see things being done but I just can't visualise it.'

Christie and Jake Daschke were newlyweds when they moved into 71 Buena Vista Road seven years ago - they too lost everything.

'Seeing that image of the house burnt is just always in my mind,' Ms Daschke, 28, said tearfully.

72-year-old Mr Seaman, a builder by trade, started rebuilding his home one month ago

While the Seaman's have tried to remain optimistic, the reality of their loss is still hard to deal with

'I thought the house would still be there but burnt. I just stood there and cried. It was really, really horrible.

'I expected to say “There's the kitchen, there's the lounge room” but the windows had actually melted and there was just a metre of brick at the base of the house left.

'Once it was cleared, it was a bit of relief but also sadness that everything we had owned together was gone.'

The Daschkes, who are expecting their first baby in December, are now expanding their once small three-bedroom home to accommodate their growing family.

Christie Daschke, 28, was a newlywed when she moved into 71 Buena Vista Road with her husband Jake seven years ago

The Daschkes once lived in this small three-bedroom home. They lost everything they owned in the fires except for their dog Mia who Jake managed to rescue at the last minute

This was all that was left of the Daschke's house when they returned the morning after the fires

Ms Daschke said she felt relieved when the remains of their house were eventually cleared away, but sad that everything she and her husband owned together was gone

'Both of us decided because we'd started there when we got married and everything we had there, we just couldn't leave. It felt like we had to go back,' she said.

The rebuild has been expensive for the young couple who only managed to save their dog Mia when the fires hit.

'I had packed a suitcase with some photos and things like that in it after the fire at Yellow Rock (5km away) a few weeks before,' she said.

'But (the suitcase) was still sitting there two weeks later so I packed it all away.

'There was no warning with this fire. It took 20 minutes to wipe out the street.'

Adrian, Jenni, Jorga and Zak Harrison hope to move back into their home at 37 Buena Vista Road by October – exactly a year on from when their house burnt down.

'Initially there was no question about it, we were going to rebuild, we were staying, we weren't going anywhere,' Mr Harrison said.

'But it's been pretty tough these first few months. It was hard watching the builders clear but once it was done there was a sense of relief that we could start again. It was too hard to go back and see the house as it was when it burnt down.'

Wayne Parker is only just going ahead with rebuilding his home of 29 years at 49 Buena Vista Road now

Mr Harrison said while he was happy to rebuild, his wife said proof that they've made the right decision will come when they move back in and see if the nervous tension and fear of it all happening again fades.

'We will have other bushfires in the valley behind us but I don't think we'll have one as bad as what we did that day,' he said.

'This fire was a freak of nature. The devastation was just unbelievable and walking through the street was like walking through some war torn country.'

Wayne Parker is only just going ahead with rebuilding his home now.

Fran Elston's home was saved in the fires but 10 of the properties around her were demolished. She erected this sign in her front yard almost immediately after the fires

'I moved in in 1985 so I've lived there a lifetime. It was a tough decision to rebuild. If it hadn't been for the Salvation Army, I wouldn't have been able to afford it,' he said.

'I had nothing left when the fire hits expect for my outdoor garden setting on the back deck. There wasn't even any ash because everything had vaporised – that's how intense the fire was.'

Mr Parker was in Sydney when the fire levelled his house and he watched it all unfold on the news.

'I had sort of prepared myself for what had happened. I stopped at the hardware store before I came back to buy rakes, shovels, gloves and things to sift through the rubble,' he said.

'But when I drove in and saw the house, I just put it all back in the car and returned it. There was no point, there was nothing left.'
