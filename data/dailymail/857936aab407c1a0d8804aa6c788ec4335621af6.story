Scene: A woman was allegedly forced into her car by a man at this Loveland, Colorado, shopping center on Thursday before she was later locked inside her trunk

At one point, the woman told the dispatcher 'I went to get some dinner...and someone came up to me and he had a gun.'

Loveland police said in the release 'a woman in Estes Park [...] had reported being forced into her own car (a blue 2013 Hyundai sedan) and abducted by a man at the Thompson Valley Towne Center parking lot in Loveland.

'She said that she was forced to drive her own car to an area just outside Estes Park and was then locked in the trunk of the car.'

During the call, the dispatcher asked the woman 'Are you still moving?'

The woman answered 'No, no, no, he got out.'

'He got out? And you're not moving now?' the dispatcher asked.

'No. Is there anything I can do to get out?' the woman asked.
