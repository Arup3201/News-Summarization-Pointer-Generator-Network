The failure of the political elite to understand public concern over immigration is fuelling mounting anger among voters, sociologists have found.

The widening ‘disconnect’ between Westminster’s ‘liberal political class’ and the views of the public has contributed to the rise of UKIP, according to the annual British Social Attitudes survey.

Persistent public anxiety over high levels of immigration is something the mainstream parties ignore at their peril, it concluded.

The survey found that fewer Britons now support the idea of multiculturalism than a decade ago.

Increasing numbers say being born in the UK or having ‘British ancestry’ are important elements of a British identity.

And, when asked about what makes people ‘truly British’, 95 per cent of the survey’s participants said speaking English was an important factor – up from 85 per cent in 2003.

The results follow a decade of mass immigration into the UK since restrictions were lifted on Eastern Europeans.

There are now some 2.5million more foreign-born British residents than a decade ago, including around a million from Poland and the seven other countries that joined in 2004.

Nigel Farage’s UKIP came top in the European elections and second in the Newark by-election, in part over concerns about immigration and EU rules that keep Britain’s borders open.

More than eight out of ten people now support a major tightening of rules on access to benefits and curbs on overall immigration.

The British Social Attitudes survey, which has been carried out every year for 30 years, pointed out the EU rules make it ‘very hard’ for the Government to cut the numbers coming here.

It said: ‘There is a clear, and intense, demand for action on the issue from one section of the electorate, a demand politicians ignore at their peril.

‘Yet responding to the concerns of the voters worried about immigration today risks alienating the rising sections of the electorate whose political voice will become steadily louder in elections to come.’  

The survey found that 47 per cent believe immigration has had a negative economic impact, compared with only 31 per cent who see it as positive. Some 45 per cent said they thought immigration had ‘undermined British cultural life’, while 35 per cent said it had enriched British culture.

The report said: ‘Policymakers and the interest groups they deal with regularly tend to be drawn heavily from the liberal end of the spectrum, creating a potential for disconnect and distrust between a more liberal political class which accepts immigration and an electorate among whom many find it intensely threatening.

‘This combination of persistent public anxiety, the disconnect in attitudes between political elites and voters, and constraints on policymakers’ ability to respond have helped to fuel the rise in support for UKIP.

‘In many areas of migration policy, constraints on current policy mean it is more liberal than even the most pro-immigration parts of the public would like, generating widespread public discontent which is hard to address.

For example, EU rules make it very hard for the Government to restrict migrant numbers, or regulate migrant access to the welfare state, in accordance with the wishes of most of the public.’

Labour MP Frank Field said the report represented a ‘huge condemnation’ of politicians’ policies on immigration and said it would be unforgivable for them to respond.

‘One of the things we must do  in drawing up our red and  blue lines for renegotiating in Europe is that we have to have control of our borders again,’ he said. The political elite has been accused for years of not taking public concerns about immigration seriously – often dismissing such fears as ‘racist’.

Most famously, during the last election Gordon Brown was caught on tape accusing a woman of being a ‘bigot’ because she asked him about Eastern European immigrants.

Last month, Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said some of her constituents who raised immigration with her were ‘frankly racist’.
