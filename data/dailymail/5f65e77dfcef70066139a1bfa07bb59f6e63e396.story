If you thought fireworks displays were impressive from the ground, wait until you see what they look like when filmed from inside the colourful explosions.

Vimeo user Gaspar C uploaded the three-minute clip of the display, filmed using a GoPro camera attached to a quadcopter.

As the drone navigates through the explosions, it captures the shells travelling into the air before bursting to life, while other shots show tails firing passed the camera in slow motion.

Although drones are heavily criticised
 for their potential to invade peopleâ€™s privacy, and even steal personal
 information, they are increasingly being used to get a unique viewpoint
 of events.

Last month, a similar DJI Phantom drone captured the Yasur volcano on Tanna Island in Vanatu as it began to erupt.

The images were taken by YouTube user Shaun O'Callaghan.

In a number of shots, the explosions illuminate the houses below.

The whole display was captured by a Phantom quadcopter from Chinese firm DJI, fitted with a GoPro Hero 3.

Remote-controlled Phantom quadcopters are capable of reaching an average of 1,000ft (330m), while average firework displays sit at around 500ft (152m).

This means the copter was able to fly above the explosions with ease.

Last month, a separate DJI Phantom drone was used to capture footage of the Yasur volcano on Tanna Island in Vanatu as it began to erupt.

Elsewhere, researchers from the University of Arkansas and the University of North Florida have been using drones on archaeological digs.

The team customised a drone by adding with a heat-sensing camera and tested it in an area called Blue J, just south of Chaco Canyon National Historical Park, Mexico.

This remote-controlled drone was able to quickly scan the landscape and pick up on the heat signatures of stone architecture hidden under layers of sediment and sagebrush.
