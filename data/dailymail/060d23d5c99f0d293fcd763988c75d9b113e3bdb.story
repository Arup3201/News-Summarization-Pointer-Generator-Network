The Texas teacher, filmed having sex with four students at her suburban home, has spoken out claiming that she is the actual victim in the case.

Brittni Colleps, 28, a former English teacher at the Kennedale High School outside Fort Worth, Texas, says that the students, who were all aged 18, conspired to film their sex romp without her consent and distributed the footage and that in no way did she every prey on anybody.

Meanwhile, Colleps' husband Christopher, an Army specialist who was away when his wife was having sex with students in May 2011, said he still loves the mother of his three children and even pleaded with the jury to show her mercy in sentencing.

Colleps, who was sentenced in August to five years in jail for 16 counts of having improper relationships with students, now says, 'I felt like I was victimized in that video, because I did not, I never gave my consent for it,' in an interview with ABC's 20/20.

'I'm not trying to say that it's not wrong or immoral for a teacher to have a sexual relationship with her students  ... but I don't think that in this situation when they were legal, consenting adults - it should not affect me or anyone else legally.'

'In no way, shape or form was I ever preying on anybody. I never coerced anybody to do anything, I never bribed anybody to do anything, I didn't offered grades in exchange for anything.'

Colleps' husband Christopher has experienced a roller-coaster ride of emotions since discovering his wife was cheating, in addition to the ensuing criminal case - telling 20/20 that learning of her betrayal was the 'toughest thing I've ever had to hear.'

But the 32-year-old, who testified that he and his wife had engaged in group sex on previous occasions, says he still loves Colleps and he asked the jury to spare his wife from jail.

'I love her with every part of my heart, every ounce of my being,' her husband told the jury.

Guilty: Brittni Colleps was convicted on 16 counts of having improper relationships with students

'I'm asking that you give her probation ... because it's not mine or my children's fault.'

Christopher Colleps, was away at Louisiana’s Fort Polk when his wife was having sex with her students.

In the 20/20 interview, the cuckold said that dealing with the aftermath of this affair will be punishment enough for his wife.

'When our children get old enough, she has to look them in the eye and tell them what she did. That is punishment,' he said. 

Similarly, Colleps mother asked the jury to not sentence Brittni to jail, for the sake of her family. 

'I'm asking you to have mercy for her kids cause they need their mom.'

Despite her family's pleas, she was 
sentenced to five years in prison without parole.

The case against Colleps has garnered national attention, as inappropriate student-teacher relationships have been on the rise across the U.S. 

For Colleps, it all began with an innocuous text message to a student, asking what time a school game was scheduled to start - but it soon escalated into sexting and at one time Colleps and the unidentified student were exchanging as many as 100 sexually explicit texts a day.

The lewd communication included messages like, 'I'm an anything goes in sex kinda girl' and 'I like pullin' hair, bitin', scratchin', spanking, I even like being choked,' according to Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Beach, who also spoke to 20/20.

Then in April 2011, Colleps  invited this student to come to her home to watch a movie and the two had sex. The student returned to her home on at least four occasions to have sex.

In May, he invited three friends from the football team to her home, while her husband and three children were away.

According to prosecutors, the teacher stripped down to her lingerie, displayed an array of sex toys and escorted the four young men to her bedroom for a group sex session.

According to video footage, taken by one of the students, 'she's performing one sex act on one student, and she is simultaneously performing another sex act on another student, and she has farmed out her kids for the night so that she can have four students in, and engage in what is more or less an orgy,' Beach explained.

After the encounter, the student began circulating the footage and it made its way to the school's administration.

Because the students were of consenting age, there were no rape charges but Texas law prohibits an inappropriate relationship between a student and teacher.

At her trial, three of the students testified that they didn't believe she did nothing wrong and that they weren't victims.

'These were not boys these were not children. These were grown men who connived, conspired and worked with each other to be with this woman,' Colleps' attorney Lex Johnston had said at her trial.
