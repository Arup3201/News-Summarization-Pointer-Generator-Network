A transgender woman has been hounded by an abusive mob which likened her to Jimmy Savile and branded her a paedophile in a vicious hate campaign. 

Nell Stockton is now frightened to leave her house in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, after being targeted by the transphobic gang.  

On one occasion, the 55-year-old divorcée, who has been living as a woman for two years, was told by thugs they would 'break her legs' because she had once been a man.

Nell Stockton has been left frightened to leave her home after being targeted by a transphobic group of youngsters who have likened her to Jimmy Savile and branded her a paedophile 

Police have installed CCTV at the home after Miss Stockton's housemate, who is also transgender, was physically attacked. 

They believe the pair are being specifically targeted because of their gender but have yet to make any arrests. 

Among the abusive slurs hurled at Miss Stockton, who works for the council helping adults with learning difficulties, are comparisons to the paedophile Jimmy Savile. 

'These people have been coming out with lots of vile things. They have been chanting "paedo, paedo", saying "are you a she-male or tranny?"' she said. 

'It is very frightening and makes me wonder if we dare leave the house in case we come back and it's ruined.'

On one occasion thugs threatened to break Miss Stockton's legs because she was born a boy. She is currently awaiting gender reassignment surgery. 

'This was in broad daylight after I finished work,' the human rights activist added. 

While the gang have not physically attacked Miss Stockton, who has a son with her former wife, her house mate was once beaten when trying to deter the mob.

Miss Stockton, who was born a boy (left), said she was eager to move on with her life after transitioning 

Police installed temporary CCTV at her home but she fears the attacks will begin again once it is removed 

Police have installed temporary CCTV at the property in the hope of catching the youngsters. But Miss Stockton fears they will return when it is removed. 

'This is all good for a while as it acts as a deterrent but when they take it away, which they will, it will all start up again.' 

An online donations page has been set up by one of her friends to help raise money to pay for a permanent solution. 

'It is difficult enough to get to this stage in life and going through the transition.... most people don't have to put up with this,' added Miss Stockton. 

'I am a hard working person and trying to get on and live and do my job. It isn't much to ask, we aren't going around being offensive to anybody.

'There is nothing worse than feeling unsafe in your own home.' 

South Yorkshire Police said it was investigating several reports of criminal damage and public order offences but have yet to make any arrests. 

'We take reports of suspected hate crime extremely seriously and incidents of this nature will not be tolerated,' a spokesman said.
