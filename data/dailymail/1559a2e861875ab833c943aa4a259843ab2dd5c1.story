Teen bodybuilder Daveon Hill is so dedicated to his sport he scoffs 5,000 calories a day and wakes at 4am to hit the gym.

The 18-year-old, from St Louis, has given his life to his passion, competing against - and beating - men twice his age.

Bulky Daveon, who can effortlessly lift his own bodyweight, consumes a whopping 5,000 calories in strict muscle building diet.

And despite turning the heads of girls his own age with his hulking physique, the teen says he is too busy for romance.

Daveon said: ‘When you love something so much, it doesn't matter how hard it gets - you have to do it.

‘I want to achieve my dream of winning a fourth Natural Olympia title, and I'll do whatever it takes to get there.’

Daveon's parents, Troy, 44, and Latasha, 42 spend more than £460 each month on extra food for their son.

Latasha prepares his meals days in advance, and he carries food with him wherever he goes to eat every three hours.

Each morning Daveon wolfs down 10 egg whites and two packs of oatmeal and then eats eight ounces of steak and sweet potato before noon.

For lunch he eats eight ounces of chicken with a cup of brown rice followed by ten ounces of fish for dinner.

And though some find it hard to believe his ripped physique is the result of hard work alone, Daveon says he would never consider using steroids.

His obsession with bodybuilding began at 10 years old after he watched his bodybuilding parents compete in a show.

At age 12 he began lifting weights under the watchful eye of personal trainer and nutritionist Troy. By age 15 he entered his first competition.

Now Daveon can bench press almost 300lbs and recently won three gold medals for the USA at the world championships in Greece.

Troy said: ‘Daveon gained 40 pounds lean muscle in two years - that's unheard of.

‘I know a lot of professional athletes - grown men - and Daveon has surpassed quite a few of them.

‘He is the youngest person ever to get his pro card at the IFPA Gateway in Missouri aged just 18.’

Despite his tender years Daveon has won six gold medals in the Natural Olympia show and world championships, including first place in the overall category competing against adults.

He said: ‘To know I've won an overall at age 15 is incredible.

Dedicated: Daveon rises at 4am to go to the gym

‘It really meant a lot that I achieved something that some people are still working to achieve at a very young age.’

Two years ago Daveon and his mother competed together in the St Louis Naturals mixed pairs competition, and took first place.

Troy said: ‘The family that prays together stays together, and a family that trains together stays healthy together.’

While some worry Daveon's obsession is preventing him from enjoying his youth, Daveon isn't worried.

He said: ‘Because I am so focused, I don't really have time for serious relationships - but they'll be waiting in the future.’

Daveon is currently in training for the Natural Olympia competition in November where he hopes to win his fourth Natural Olympia title.

Troy said: ‘Daveon doesn't walk around with his chest stuck out, there's no bragging to him at all - he just loves to compete and he's very good at what he does.’
