A father allegedly stabbed his little daughter in the chest and then shot her mother before driving the bodies to a rural road where he shot himself.

Jesse Saldivar, 48, killed toddler Sabrina Saldivar, aged just three, and her mother Veronica Erazo-Alderado, 30, in Las Vegas, Nevada, police said.

Police were called when the mother did not turn up for work, after she was meant to drop off Sabrina at the home of Mr Saldivar - her ex-boyfriend.

The tragedy was made all the more worse by there being a 13-year-old son left behind. The couple had reportedly broken up months before.

Their son was said to have told neighbours: ‘Have you seen my mom? We called everywhere, she didn't answer her phone,’ reported ABC 13.

Police tracked down Mr Saldivar's vehicle after finding blood at his home following a call-out by Ms Erazo-Alderado's current boyfriend.

He feared the worst when she did not arrive at work at a hospital on Friday and told police she had gone to leave her child at Mr Saldivar's home.

‘I can't believe it still,’ Ms 
Erazo-Alderado’s former neighbour Srrgut Tessmen told ABC 13. ‘Never, I 
would never think that (this could happen).’

A spokesman for St Rose Dominican Hospitals, where Ms Erazo-Alderado used to work, said she was a valued member of staff.

‘She was a dynamic person who gave to her family and her job unselfishly,’ the spokesman told ABC 13.

Mr Saldivar did not have a criminal 
record in Las Vegas and there were no reported incidents of domestic 
abuse involving the couple.

Property records show a bank foreclosed on Mr Saldivar’s home in October, but he continued to live there.
