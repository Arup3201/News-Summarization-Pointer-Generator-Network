The five-year-old had returned from a family trip to Guinea on Saturday night on a Moroccan Airlines flight which landed at JFK. 

He was screened but did not have a fever when he entered the U.S., CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said on Monday. 

A team of 'disease detectives' were tracing the boy's contacts on Monday in case he tested positive for the virus.  

Four members of the child's family have been quarantined inside their apartment at 172nd Street, law enforcement officials said, but told EMTs that they did not have contact with anyone infected with Ebola while in Guinea.

Those under quarantine at the Bronx apartment are believed to be the boy's father, 52, a 15-year-old sister and two brothers, aged 13 and two years old, the Daily News reported. 

A New York City Health department official hands out information on the Ebola virus to people riding on a school bus near a Bronx apartment building where a 5-year-old boy who arrived from Guinea was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Sunday

Police stand guard outside an apartment building at 172nd Street on Monday in the Bronx where a five-year-old boy was rushed to hospital on Monday after developing Ebola-like symptoms the day after returning from Guinea in West Africa

The building was being guarded by police today as community outreach workers handed out leaflets with information about Ebola. 

The boy's preliminary test results were expected later today, hospital officials said on Monday.

Commissioner of the NYC Health Department, Dr Mary Bassett, said: 'He has no clear exposure to Ebola but his exposure history is unclear.' 

Neighbors in the six-story building appeared not to have been informed about a resident with Ebola-like symptoms.  

One neighbor told the New York Post: 'He looked out of it. I hope he’ll be OK. They’re a nice, hardworking family... I heard he was playing with the neighbor’s kids and she sent them to school today.'

Guinea is one of the three countries, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, at the center of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. 

It has since grown into the largest ever outbreak of the disease killing some 5,000 people in the region.

The boy was rushed to Bellevue from his home in the Bronx after developing a 103F and vomiting, emergency workers said 

New York's first confirmed Ebola patient, Dr Craig Spencer, is currently being treated in an isolation ward at Bellevue Hospital after contracting the virus in  Guinea.

He was in a serious but stable condition on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.   

The hospital said that he was 'awake, communicating, and in good spirits' but has entered the next stage of his illness.

He is receiving antiviral therapy as well as plasma therapy after getting a plasma transfusion from Ebola survivor, aid worker Nancy Writebol.

Mrs Writebol, 59, recovered from Ebola after contracting the virus during missionary work in Liberia in July. 

Dr Spencer, 33, was admitted to the hospital on Thursday - just six days after returning from Guinea where he he was helping to fight the outbreak with the Doctors Without Borders organisation.

His fiancée, 30-year-old Morgan Dixon, who was initially being quarantined at Bellevue has been allowed to go home under quarantine.   

It was reported this weekend that Bellevue hospital staff caring for Dr Spencer were being denied service at local restaurants and had their children treated differently.

Mayor Bill de Blasio held an afternoon press conference in which he called such treatment 'absolutely unacceptable', and said there would be consequences for  individuals' found disrespecting nurses or other medical personnel.

Dr Craig Spencer returned to New York from Guinea on October 17, and was admitted to hospital six days later with symptoms of the deadly virus

Mayor de Blasio and his wife Chiraline McCray visited the isolation ward at Bellevue where Dr Spencer is being treated and said the volunteering health care workers they encountered there were 'calm, cool, collected and purposeful'.

However, he was shocked to hear reports about how some of these doctors and nurses were being denied food and treated differently when strangers learned they worked at the hospital.

Mayor de Blasio did not specify what kind of punishment could be handed out.

The mayor described the Bellevue workers treating Dr Craig Spencer as the 'the first responders in this crisis' and like 'the Marines of our health care system'.

The mayor also addressed a nurse who was being monitored this weekend in New Jersey, under new rules in both New Jersey and New York requiring health care workers returning from West Africa to submit to a 21-day quarantine.

Nurse Kaci Hickox talked to CNN about her 'inhumane' containment at the airport, saying she is confined in a tent with limited contact to the outside world, no flushable toilet, TV or reading material.   

'Unacceptable': New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio held a press conference on Sunday to address reports that Bellevue health care workers were being mistreated for working at the hospital where the city's first Ebola patient is being cared for 

Mayor de Blasio appeared to hit out at New Jersey officials, by calling the conditions of Ms Hickox's quarantine 'inappropriate'.

'The problem here is that this hero coming back from the front, having done the right thing, was treated with disrespect and was treated as if she had done something wrong when she hadn't,' Mayor de Blasio said. 

'We owe her better than that.' 

However, the mayor added that he respects the right of other governments to make their own decisions in how to handle this outbreak.  

'Inhumane': Mayor De Blasio also spoke about Nurse Kaci Hickox, who is currently under quarantine in New Jersey. The nurse spoke to CNN, calling her quarantine 'inhumane' for having no access to a flushable toilet, TV or reading material. Mr De Blasio said her treatment was 'inappropriate'
