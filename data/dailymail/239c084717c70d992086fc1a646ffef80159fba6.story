Quiet time: A prep school leader has claimed that boredom in children is no bad thing and can prepare them for dull moments in adulthood

Boredom in children is no bad thing and can prepare them for dull moments in adulthood, a prep school leader has warned.

Cramming children’s schedules with extra-curricular activities could hinder their development and make youngsters manic and anxious.

Julie Robinson, the education and training director of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS), said time should be made for reflection, meditation and calm.

‘It is all too easy for parents to be sucked into a competitive busyness, ensuring that children are constantly occupied and stimulated,’ she told the IAPS magazine.

‘We should not fear boredom however. Quiet, reflective time is just as important as purposeful activity.’

Parents who push their children too hard with extra-curricular activities risk burning them out, but youngsters left to amuse themselves could lose their competitiveness, she added.

The former headmistress warned that digital pastimes could not provide children with well-rounded development, and said: ‘Computers are an exciting fact of life now but do bear in mind that human development follows a pattern of phases and stages which has not changed because of the digital revolution.

‘Children need time to develop through tactile play and plenty of movement, developing dexterity.

‘Through making friends and suffering occasional unkindness we develop an understanding of the motives of others and by trial and error we learn effective communication skills.

‘These soft skills are what future employers will look for, and by encouraging explicit analysis of social interaction we will serve today’s children.’

In a message to parents, she concluded: ‘So, above all, try to resist being accidentally drawn into ‘overbearing parenting’ by pre-planning each minute.

‘Children need space and time so that they can develop independence and take risks.’

Justine Roberts, a co-founder of Mumsnet, the parenting website, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Of course there are some tiger mum types who are micromanaging packed improvement schedules for their children, but on Mumsnet, certainly, they are far outweighed by others who share the view that unstructured time is really important.

‘Broadly speaking, our users seem to feel that free playtime gives children room to explore, experiment and learn.’
