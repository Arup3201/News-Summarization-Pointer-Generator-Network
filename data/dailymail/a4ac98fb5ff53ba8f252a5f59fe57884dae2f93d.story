'The bit we've excavated at the moment is prehistoric - it's Iron Age - but we have picked up traces of some Roman Romano-British field boundaries,' she told the BBC.

'It's probably going to take us a very long time for us to fully understand the nature of the settlement and how long it was occupied for.'
