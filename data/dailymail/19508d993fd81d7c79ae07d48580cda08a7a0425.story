England (4-4-2): Hart; Stones, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wilshere, Sterling; Rooney, Sturridge.

England begin a new era amidst an expected record low Wembley attendance with a new captain and a new line-up as they aim put the dismal World Cup behind them.

Manager Roy Hodgson has chosen his starting XI for the friendly against Norway and in England's warm-up for the start of Euro 2016 qualification next week it is a glimpse of what is to come.

Not content with the 4-2-3-1 formation which has been made so popular in the Premier League in recent years or the latest trend of 3-5-2, Hodgson has reverted back to the traditional 4-4-2 of old: Hart; Stones, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wilshere, Sterling; Rooney, Sturridge.

At the moment it leaves us with many questions that will only be answered in the next two years on the road to France.

Can Jack Wilshere step into the void left by Steven Gerrard in the centre of midfield, in the absence of Frank Lampard? He was challenged to by Hodgson yesterday in his pre-match press conference.

Does Gary Cahill have the ability to become England's lynchpin at the back – a centre-back the national team is crying out for? The new-look defence needs a leader.

Top dog: Hodgson will be hoping Joe Hart (centre) shows more consistency than last season

Will Joe Hart maintain consistent form to warrant a place in goal? Can Raheem Sterling take his scintillating form for Liverpool on to the world stage?

What will happen when captain Wayne Rooney is caught up in the heat of the moment? In that formation Hodgson is expecting him to drop back to help the midfield when England don't have the ball.

England been handed what should be a straightforward group to qualify for Euro 2016, but they have a lot of work ahead to get punters back through the Wembley gates.
