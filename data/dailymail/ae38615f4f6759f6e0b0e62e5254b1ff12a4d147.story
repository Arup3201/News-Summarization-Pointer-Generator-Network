Hollywood movie director Steven Spielberg is the talk of the internet after a photo of him posing with a 'dead' dinosaur went viral.

The picture, taken on the set of his 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, was posted online last Sunday by Facebook meme-maker and wit Jay Branscomb.

In an apparent reference to the furor surrounding Kendall Jones, the 19-year-old Texas cheerleader who has gained notoriety for posing with exotic animal she has killed, Branscomb added a jokey caption claiming the photo showed a ‘despicable’ hunter.

‘Disgraceful photo of recreational hunter happily posing next to a Triceratops he just slaughtered. Please share so the world can name and shame this despicable man,’ read his humorous caption.

But it appears that not everyone was able to appreciate Branscomb’s sarcastic sense of humor and failing to recognize the world famous director, they took the photo at face value.

One Facebook commenter who misunderstood Branscomb’s humur was PenelopeRayzor Bachand. She labelled Spielberg an ‘inhumane p****’ and ‘animal killer.’

‘Steven Spielberg, I’m disappointed in you. I’m not watching any of your movies again ANIMAL KILLER,’ she ended her impassioned rant.

Joker? 'I don't care who he is, he should not have shot that animal' wrote Vincent Smith

‘I don’t care who he is, he should not have shot that animal,' wrote Vincent Smith.

A number of other commenters also apparently fail to realize that the triceratops has been extinct for 66 million years ago and that Spielberg, one of the most famous movie makers of all time, is sitting beside a mechanical prop from a movie which has grossed more than $1 billion and won three Academy Awards.

To date, Branscomb’s post has received over 9,000 likes, been shared more than 30,000 times and attracted more than 5,000 comments.

Just in case there is anyone out there who hasn't cottoned on to Branscomb's original gag, he has posted a new photo, this time featuring Spielberg almost 20 years earlier when he was filming Jaws in 1975.

‘Folks, we need your help identifying the vicious shark-killer shown posing with his illegal prey,' wrote Branscomb.

'Sharks are essential to the eco-system and their waters are protected off the coast of California. If you have any knowledge of this fiend's identity or whereabouts, please contact authorities immediately.'
