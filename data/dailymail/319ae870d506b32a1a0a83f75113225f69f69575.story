The Olympic opening ceremony took place under threat of a cyber attack, security experts have revealed.

Nearly a year on, Oliver Hoare, head of cyber security for the London 2012 Games, has told how officials feared the Olympic stadium lights could be switched off by a remote attack.

He was telephoned by Government intelligence agency GCHQ in the early hours of July 27, the day of the £27million opening ceremony with the warning.

The threat was discovered by GCHQ only hours before the ceremony began on July 27 last year

The threat failed to materialise, but security officials have now revealed the extent of the precautions they took to make sure the celebrations went off without a hitch.

'There was a suggestion that there was a credible attack on the electricity infrastructure supporting the Games,' Mr Hoare told a BBC Radio 4 programme, which will be broadcast this evening.

'And the first reaction to that is, "Goodness, you know, let's make a strong cup of coffee and get into the office".'

Mr Hoare said that extensive testing took place in anticipation of a wide range of attacks, including the exact scenario that raised concerns at GCHQ.

He said: 'We'd tested no less than five times the possibility of an attack, a cyber attack, on the electricity infrastructure.

'In a sense I think we felt pretty well prepared, but there's always an amount of concern, particularly when you've only got eight or nine hours before the opening ceremony.'

The Government, Olympic organiser Locog and service providers such as BT were all part of a team that responded to such threats.

The primary response to the threat came from the Olympic Cyber Co-ordination Team, based at MI5 headquarters in Thames House.

This involved assessing how credible the threat of attack might be, a process which took place while officials put in place a contingency plan.

'The clock was absolutely ticking,' Mr Hoare told the BBC.

'We effectively switched to manual, or had the facility to switch to manual.

'It's a very crude way of describing it, but effectively we had lots of technicians stationed at various points.'

He said there was so much back-up in place that 'if all the lights went out in east London you could guarantee that the Olympic Stadium would still be burning brightly'.

In the afternoon before the ceremony, a Cabinet meeting discussed contingency plans and ministers were informed of the issues.

But officials became increasingly confident that they could deal with the threat if it happened.

An hour before the ceremony, a colleague told Mr Hoare: 'if the lights go down we can get them up and running regardless within 30 seconds'.

'Thirty seconds at the opening ceremony with the lights going down would have been catastrophic in terms of reputational hit,' Mr Hoare said.

'So I watched the opening ceremony with a great deal of trepidation.'

The attack failed to materialise, but Mr Hoare said he twitched every time the lights in the stadium dimmed as he watched the ceremony at home with his family, who were unaware of the threat.

He said: 'You wouldn't be human if you didn't have butterflies.'
