A high-powered Seattle attorney has been sentenced to serve 25 years in prison for the rape of five massage therapists.

Danford Grant, 49, pleaded guilty on May 7 to five counts third-degree rape and one count of first-degree burglary in a plea deal.

Four of the victims wrote letters that were read at the sentencing detailing how Grant's crimes had devastated their lives.Â

Indefensible: Danford Grant pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 25 years on Monday May 19

The emotional statements prompted Judge William Downing to say of the victims, 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied.'

Earlier this month, Grant plead guilty to the crimes. Had his case gone to trial, it was expected that his defense attorneys would have argued that he engaged in paid, consensual sex with the victims.

Grant was arrested in September 2012 following a series of sexual assaults on massage therapists in Seattle, Shoreline and Bellevue in 2011 and 2012.

He targeted the minority women, knowing they would have difficulty reporting the crime because of language barriers and cultural attitudes surrounding sex, said King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg.

'He thought he chose his victims wisely,' Satterberg said after Grant's guilty plea, reports the Seattle Times.

Grant, a married father of three children, worked as an employment and business litigator and was a founding member of his own law firm.

Investigators found that Grant's modus operandi was to go to Asian-run massage businesses after making an appointment under a fake name and using different phone numbers.

He would lull the masseuse into a false sense of security by acting politely and mentioning his position as an attorney or even lying that he was a police officer or doctor to bolster his stature.

According to Seattle PI, he would sometimes lie that his wife was dead and profess love for the masseuse before asking for sex.

When the masseuse denied his request, he would violently attack her, often at knife-point, and try to rape her.

Investigators discovered he would research massage businesses online and find out personal information about the massage therapists.

None of the victims appeared in court for Grant's sentencing, but their letters spoke eloquently on the violence he visited upon their lives and the continuing trauma they suffer.

Traumatic: Danford Grant stalked Asian masseuses online and then raped them violently during or after appointments he scheduled under false names

'I really wanted to be present during the court proceedings, but I did not have the courage to see this person again. When I saw him on the news on May 5th, my entire body trembled and I lost strength in all limbs,' wrote one.

She continued that she is now always scared, suffers panic attacks and becomes terrified if she sees a man on the street who resembles Grant.

'I will never forget about the humiliation, the dark shadow, and the trauma that this incident has brought upon me and I will be entangled in these feelings for the rest of my life,' she wrote.

One woman told her husband she had been attacked with a knife, not divulging that she had also been raped, so great was her shame and distress.

'It has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me... I now suspect every male customer... Any small sudden motion by them will trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me. I'm particularly fearful of the ones who appear well-mannered and friendly because they would remind me of the bastard who tried to rape me,' she wrote.

The woman said that she did not want to appear in court because in Chinese culture, it would cause herself and her family more shame and embarrassment.

'Maybe that's why the defendant had been picking on Asian victims who are more vulnerable and helpless,' she wrote.

In one instance, Grant followed a masseuse back to her car after receiving a massage and ordered her into the the vehicle before driving somewhere secluded and raping her in the back seat.

In another, he returned to a business where he had previously tried to rape a masseuse and forced his way in when he was denied entry before raping the masseuse.

One victim said that she had undertaken many months of study to become a massage therapist and was horrified when she discovered that Grant's attorneys intended to argue that the women prostituted themselves.

'I read articles in the news and some reader's comments that said these were "just Asian prostitutes." Then the defense lawyer said this was consensual sex and prostitution. It made me sick to my stomach... [To become a professional therapist] I did everything that Washington state requires here. I spent a lot of time and I worked very hard to complete school... I am a good, moral woman and I strictly respect my career as a massage therapist and skin care professional,' she wrote.

The husband of one victim also wrote a statement, describing coming home to find his wife on the floor in the fetal position in the aftermath of the attack.

Lasting trauma: Grant targeted the women because he believed their language barrier and awe at his stature as well as shame and embarrassment would prevent them coming forward

He was finally caught after raping a masseuse at knife-point at a Greenwood spa when the owner and others arrived as he was leaving.

A struggle ensued and police found him two blocks away from the parlor.

A victim wrote that she weeps in the middle of the night and cannot bring herself to use a small knife in the kitchen because it looks similar to the knife Grant threatened her with.

Grant himself read a long letter in which he detailed his past problems with addictions and 'commercial sex.'

'Although, the truth about what I did is dramatically different from what was alleged, I do not minimize my real wrongs and my apology for those particular wrongs is genuine and heartfelt,' he said.

He painted himself as a dutiful husband and father and said he came to commit his crimes because he suffered anxierty and depression and 'commercial sex' was a way to escape his problems and 'distorted' his thinking.

Mary Ellen Stone, executive director of the King County Sexual Assault Resource center, said Grant's victims have been exceptionally brave.

'It was likely that the Grant victims faced even more hesitation due to Grant's prestige, their own language barriers, cultural differences, and fear of deportation,' Stone said in a statement, reports Seattle PI. 'Their willingness potentially to face this man in trial is heroic.'
