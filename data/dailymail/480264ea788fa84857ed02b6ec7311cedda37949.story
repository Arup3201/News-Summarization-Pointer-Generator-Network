There was a time not long ago that Europe’s leading clubs – not to mention the agents who worked with them – saw Manchester City as the biggest cash cow in football. Fuelled by new money and eager to go places quickly, City needed to spend quickly and lavishly to get there.

City admit now that they made some mistakes. They invested heavily in transfer fees and wages for players that didn’t have the right attitude – such as the Brazilian Robinho – or simply weren’t good enough – such as the former England left-back Wayne Bridge.

Five or six years on and, as strange as it sounds, it’s City’s neighbours Manchester United that are facing similar challenges. Having fallen behind rivals such as City and Chelsea last season, the biggest club in England are playing catch-up and that makes them vulnerable.

Man United are facing challenges in the transfer market and could be tempted to sign Cristiano Ronaldo

Man City were seen as football's biggest cash cow not long ago and signed striker Sergio Aguero for £38m

Man City did make mistakes in the transfer market, including the signings of Wayne Bridge and Robinho

The deal United chief executive Ed Woodward recently put together for the Argentinean winger Angel di Maria involved some high numbers. Taking in to account a £60m transfer fee and wages around the £250,000-a-week mark, the total investment is north of £120m over the length of the 26-year-old’s contract.

That deal made sense in many ways. United needed to make a statement and Louis van Gaal’s squad needed quality. It satisfied both needs.

The subsequent arrival of Radamel Falcao on similar wages for a season’s loan caused eyebrows to be raised at other Barclays Premier League clubs, though. The Colombian has, after all, only recent returned from a serious knee injury.

Many people in English football think that was one big punt too far by Van Gaal and Woodward and perhaps the true worth of that deal will only be measured accurately when we see what Falcao manages to deliver during his time in England.

All of this, meanwhile, does bring us to the case of the player most supporters would dearly like to see back at Old Trafford, Cristiano Ronaldo.

The emotional appeal of a move for the World Player of the Year is clear. Ronaldo enjoyed some remarkable years at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson and, at the age of 29, remains at his peak. As has been the case before since he left England for Madrid in 2009, Ronaldo appears to be a little unsettled at the Bernabeu.

Once again, though, the numbers do not really make sense.

When Ronaldo’s wage demands landed on the desks of executives at Europe’s elite clubs as his representatives endeavoured to engineer a transfer in the summer of 2013, it didn’t take long for the vast majority to look the other day. At upwards of £350,000-a-week, it was just too much.

United did get involved, though. Seeking a marquee signing to help David Moyes on his way, tentative negotiations did take place.

More than a year on, though, it is hard to see United seriously giving consideration once again to bringing Ronaldo ‘home’ next summer. Those with a good working knowledge of Spanish football firmly believe that Real will look to move Ronaldo on next year.

Ronaldo was hawked around Europe’s top clubs last summer before eventually signing a new five-year deal

United, though, are a club that need to address fundamentals rather than chase luxuries. The evidence of this season already tells us that Van Gaal is not short on players who can create and score goals after the heavy spending of the summer.

What van Gaal does not have is world class central defenders and that most crucial modern commodity of all, a dominating holding midfield player.

In the past United have been accused of lacking ambition in the transfer market. The approach of Ferguson and Woodward’s predecessor David Gill was never to overpay and always to see what they described as ‘value. Because of this, some of Europe’s star names did slip away from them.

Man United manager Louis van Gaal has plenty of attacking options but no world-class central defender

Nobody can accuse Van Gaal and Woodward of being slow coming forwards. Their aggressive approach of the last window was perhaps justified simply because of their club’s clear need.

A line in the sand will have to be drawn somewhere, however. There is a difference between being positive and ambitious and appearing a little reckless.

United need some long-term planning and some pragmatic thinking. Indulging in emotional fantasies will only get you so far in football and that is why a move for Ronaldo next summer just doesn’t really make any sense.
