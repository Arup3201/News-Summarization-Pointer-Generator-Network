England will travel north of the border for the first time in 15 years to face Scotland in a friendly at Celtic Park on November 18.

Roy Hodgson's side are still recovering from their dismal performance at the World Cup but the FA have wasted no time in announcing another high profile clash against Gordon Strachan's side.

The two countries met at Wembley in August last year, with the Three Lions winning 3-2 courtesy of Rickie Lambert's first international goal.

Moving on: Wayne Rooney and England will face Scotland at Celtic Park in a friendly in November

Magic moment: Rickie Lambert (centre) celebrates scoring England's winning goal against Scotland at Wembley last year

Classic: West Brom midfielder James Morrison (third from left) opened the scoring at Wembley but England battled back to win

Heads up: Danny Welbeck (centre) makes it 2-2 against the Scots with a well-placed header

The game will be the first match between the two sides in Scotland since the first leg of a Euro 2000 play-off in November 1999.

Paul Scholes scored twice at Hampden Park to seal a 2-0 victory, with Kevin Keegan's side going on to make the European Championships despite a 1-0 loss in the return leg at Wembley.

November's clash will be played at Celtic Park, the home of Scottish champions Celtic, due to renovation work at Hampden Park.

The friendly will be England's final game this year and comes three days after Hodgson's men face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier.

Last time: Paul Scholes scores the second of his two goals during England's last visit to Scotland, a 2-0 win in 1999 at Hampden Park

Man of the moment: Scholes celebrates scoring during England's Euro 2000 play-off first leg victory

Level terms: Arsenal forward Theo Walcott scored England's equaliser against the Scots to make it 1-1

Still got it: Veteran striker Kenny Miller (centre) celebrates giving Scotland a 2-1 lead against the Three Lions
