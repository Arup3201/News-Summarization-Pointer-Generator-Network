A boxer that only has front legs refuses to let his disability hold him back as he charges across a beach with his four-legged pals.

In an adorable video showing his first trip to the beach, Duncan Lou Who can been seen excitedly galloping along the sand and paddling in the water.

His exciting day trip was filmed by Panda Paws Rescue, a Washington state-based charity that cares for Duncan and other dogs with special needs.Â

Thrilling: Duncan races across the beach despite having no back legs

Delighted: The boxer, which was born with deformed back legs, looks excited about his beach day

Despite only having front limbs, the boxer is able to not only balance, but also run really fast and play with the other dogs that joined him for the outing.

He was born with deformed back legs, which were later removed to make the dog more comfortable.

His owners, who posted the video on YouTube earlier this week, said he has a wheelchair but doesn't like to use it.

'We let him be free and just walk on his two legs. There is some slow motion in this video, but none of the video has been sped up, this gives you an idea of how fast Duncan really it,' his owners said.

The thrill of running through the surf was clear to see, as Duncan raced people and dogs across the sand, with his tail wagging excitedly.

Duncan's owners have described him as a 'trooper', adding on charity's Facebook page: 'He's happy, healthy and as far as he knows, normal too.

'It would be the best if he had four legs, of course, but his body wasn't built to have back legs and that's OK. He and we have just adapted.'
