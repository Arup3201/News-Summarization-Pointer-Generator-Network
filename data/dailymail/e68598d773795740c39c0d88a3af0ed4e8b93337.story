A woman charged with drink driving after consuming four bottles of wine in three hours  recorded the highest blood alcohol level a Victorian court had ever seen.

Ruth Spycella, 48, allegedly drank the alcohol between 8.30am and 11.30am on July 24, before driving around Geelong and crashing into the back of a parked off-duty police car.

When police attended the scene, Ms Spychella, from Clifton Springs, recorded an astounding blood alcohol level of .423, which magistrate Ann McGarvie said was the highest she had ever seen in a person who was alive, reported news.com.au.

Ms Spychella was driving when she crossed onto the wrong side of the road, mounted the curb and collided head on with the car, and was later pulled from the vehicle slurring her words.

She smelled strongly of alcohol and had to be carried to the ambulance, and was taken to Geelong Hospital where she was administered the blood alcohol test.

The Geelong Magistrates Court found Ms Spychella guilty of exceeding the .05 blood alcohol limit and of careless driving.

Police prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Kerrie Moroney, said that it was possible for Ms Spychella to have drunk four bottles of wine in the three hour time frame.

'She did not recall driving along Beacon Point Rd or turning into Camberwarra Ave,' Senior Constable Moroney said.

Dr Alex Wodak, President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation said that the blood alcohol was certainly very high, and indicated not only the driving incident she had been charged with but also posed a serious health issue.

'If a person is not tolerant to drinking alcohol very frequently, then that level of alcohol would have made it impossible for her to control her body, or even to speak,' Dr Wodak said.

'The fact that she was capable of driving a vehicle indicates that she was very tolerant to alcohol and to drinking at high levels.'

Ms Spychella's defense council, Richard Concha, said that she had been suffering from alcohol and anxiety for 13 years, and that she was currently undergoing rehabilitation.

Mr Concha said 'I don’t know how she was alive, let alone able to move,' reported The Courier Mail.

Dr Wodak said that the risk of having a car crash increases 'quite spectacularly' with the consumption of alcohol, doubling at .05 blood alcohol and tripling at .08.

Geelong Magistrates Court heard that it was the highest blood alcohol the court had ever seen in a living person 

'There have not been many people who have been recorded with a breath alcohol concentration of that level. It's not the world record but it's extremely high.'  

'The problems that people have when they drunk range from their judgement and reaction time decreasing, to being less able to cope with multiple tasks and have focus or attention,' he said.

'It's not just creating defects in one area of driving performance, it's in all of them.' 

Ms Spychella was ordered to serve 120 hours of community service under a two-year community corrections order.
