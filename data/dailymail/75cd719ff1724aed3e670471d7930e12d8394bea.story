England’s Commonwealth Games diving team, led by Tom Daley, arrive in Glasgow on Thursday after a mid-air plane drama in which they felt certain they were about to die.

The eight divers, who also comprise Great Britain’s ‘A team’ of talent at Olympic level, were left shaking and tearful after a flight from China to London had to make an emergency diversion which ended with a plunging, shuddering landing in Siberia.

The incident happened on Monday, as the world remained in shock about the appalling loss of life in the Malaysian Airways tragedy last week over Ukraine.

With the divers’ Virgin Airways Airbus 340 dumping fuel as it descended and with some of the passengers believing they were about to be forced to make a dangerous landing on water, the British divers feared for their lives. 

‘I thought we were going to die,’ said Chris Mears, a 21-year-old springboard specialist, who is one of the athletes Sportsmail is following on the Road to Rio.

‘It was scary beyond belief.’

Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, Mears was the first of the divers to describe in detail how the  incident unfolded. 

He was travelling with seven other divers — Daley, Jack Laugher, Alicia Bragg, Becky Gallantree, Hannah Sterling, Sarah Burrow and Tonia Couch and eight GB  support staff on the way back from a World Cup event in Shanghai. The party also included Daley’s boyfriend Lance Black, aboard an aircraft carrying 301 people in total.

The plane 
took off on Monday morning, Chinese time and it became apparent after 
around three hours into the trip that something was badly wrong.

‘People around me were sleeping but I wanted to stay awake to try to get my body clock right for landing back in the UK,’ Mears said. ‘I was watching movies, and keeping an eye on the flight time to destination (clock).

‘And then suddenly it dropped from around eight hours remaining to an hour and 10 minutes, within a few seconds.

‘I knew something wasn’t right, and within a few moments an alarm went off, like a blaring klaxon, and then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical fault and we would need to land in Moscow.’

Mears was near the back of the plane, with his synchro partner Laugher on one side and Barrow on the other. Couch, distraught and panicking, was nearby. Daley, equally concerned, was seated a few rows back.

The time 
to destination clock then changed again, falling within a few minutes 
from 50 minutes left to 30 minutes and then 14 minutes.

‘They’d seen that we weren’t going to reach Moscow,’ Mears said. ‘We were obviously going to come down wherever we could. 

‘One of our team overheard a staff member on the plane suggesting that the pilot might have to land on water. There was no confirmation of this, no announcement, but there was a lake ahead.’

The pilot began dumping all the fuel stored in the wings. Some passengers mistook the hazy  dispersal to be smoke and began to fear the plane could be on fire.

‘Only a handful of us heard what we thought was a reference to landing on water,’ Mears said. 

‘Tonia was so upset. Jack and I were trying to keep it together, almost laughing, although it was hysterical. What was going through my head was “The whole of Team GB is going to die here”.’The plane descended rapidly, although under control.

Mears 
assumed the pilot needed to get to the ground as quickly as possible to 
reach the runway at the small  airport where they touched down, as 
opposed to ditching on water.

‘When we hit the ground, the braking was about 10 times more sudden than usual, maybe because we didn’t have a lot of runway left,’ he said.

The plane landed at a small  airport near Irkutsk in Siberia. There was a wait of around an hour as the craft was surrounded by fire engines before all the passengers disembarked, safe but shaken.

‘Tom was beside himself,’ Mears said. ‘It was so scary for everyone. We thought that was it.’ The  passengers spent Monday night  in a hotel in Siberia while Virgin sent another plane to bring them back to Britain.

They arrived back on Tuesday and spent Thursday in London, preparing for their trip to Scotland by train.

‘What happened to us was insignificant compared to the awful events on flight MH17,’ Mears said. ‘Of course all our thoughts are with those victims and their families. 

‘We also have nothing but thanks for Virgin, who got us safely on the ground, and then home. 

‘Something like this definitely puts  things in perspective for all of us.

‘We’re just glad to be here, and grateful to be in a position to take part in a sports event.’
