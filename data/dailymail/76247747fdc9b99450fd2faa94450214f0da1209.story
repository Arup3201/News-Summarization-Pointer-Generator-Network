A Ukrainian lorry driver is being sought by police after a video was shared on line that showed him  driving his HGV from the passenger seat while using his feet.

And just to make sure everybody knew how relaxed he was, he's even seen drinking a cup of tea sweetened he said with a bit of honey.

The video was posted in Russian with a note: 'Sometimes one gets tired just sitting behind the wheel, in the passenger seat however it doesn't seem like work at all.'

In an attempt to 'impress' his friends, the lorry driver steers the vehicle with his feet

To show how 'relaxed' he is, he passes the time drinking some tea

But when the video was uploaded on the internet it quickly went viral before it was removed, although not before he had been reported to police in several countries.

The uploader claimed the video was actually shot in Mexico but many other users were convinced it was shot either in America or Canada.

Others quickly shared the video as an example of further stupidity on the roads and urged assistance in helping police to try and help identify where the road was and who the man was.

After seeing the enormous amount of traffic the video was deleted by the uploader nicknamed 'vitsipo1' who tried to claim it was filmed in Mexico City.

Complaints were made to the police after people viewed the video online

The driver has been identified as Vitaliy Zaporozhets by users online

With vehicles overtaking the lorry, the immense danger of the whole incident is apparent

In the comments under the video before it was deleted one person even provides a name for the alleged driver, Vitaliy Zaporozhets, saying he is a Ukrainian.

Others found out that the was a YouTube user called Vitaliy Zaporozhets who was a Ukrainian and has a YouTube channel with a single video that shows him acting up with his friends by undressing down to his boxers while driving, with the three young men eventually identifying themselves as being Ukrainian, Romanian and Moldavian.

The images in the two videos look very similar but the search is still continuing.
