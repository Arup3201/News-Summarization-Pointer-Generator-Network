Throughout evolution, living things have repeatedly developed physically distinct sexes, but how does this actually happen?

Thatâ€™s the question scientists were hoping to answer when they performed a genetic engineering trick on multicellular algae.

And they were surprised to find the process through which one gender produces eggs and the other sperm was more simple than expected - and the scientists could switch the gender roles of the algae.

Scientists in Missouri have revealed they could induce gender (stock image shown) in cells. They performed the trick by identifying and modifying a gene in multicellular algae. This gene was responsible for giving the algae one of two mating types, but they also made it switch gender

The study, led by Dr James Umen at the Danforth Plant Science Center in Missouri and published in Plos Biology, looked at the multicellular green algae Volvox carteri.

A neuroscientist has claimed the expression 'Men are from Mars and women are from Venus' has no scientific grounding, and that instead our brains are changed by the roles society forces us to play.

According to Gina Rippon, a professor at Aston University in Birmingham, stereotypes - such as women's supposed inability to read maps, or the idea men are bad at multitasking - have no links to science.

Instead of being wired in different ways, Professor Rippon said that men and women are only dissimilar because the world we live in encourages gender role-playing.

Speaking in March she said the differences between men and women are caused by the 'drip, drip, drip' of gender stereotypes.According to The Telegraph she said: 'You can't pick up a brain and say "that's a girl's brain, or that's a boy's brain" in the same way you can with the skeleton. They look the same.'There is pretty compelling evidence that any differences are tiny and are the result of environment not biology.'

The researchers identified the master regulatory gene for sex determination in Volvox.

They found that it differed from a related gene in a close relative that did not have physically distinguishable sexes.

The findings may also provide a possible blueprint for how sexes in other multicellular organisms like plants and animals may have originated.

For plants and animals having male and female reproductive cells - also known as gametes - is the norm.

The differences between the two types of gametes in males and females are obvious.

Male gametes are small mobile sperm or pollen, while female gametes are large egg cells.

However, the evolutionary origins of male and female sexes are unclear because the distant relatives of plants, animals and other multicellular species generally don't have distinct sexes.

Instead they have a system in which gametes of one mating type can only fuse with those with a different mating type.

The researchers found they were able to identify a gene called MID that controlled two mating types labelled 'plus' and 'minus'.

By forcing genetically female Volvox to express MID, the team was able to convert what would have been egg cells into packets of functional sperm cells.

Conversely, by using a method of gene inactivation called RNA interference (RNAi), the scientists were able to block MID expression in genetic males causing them to develop with functional eggs in place of their sperm packets.

The team was even able to use their gender-swapped strains to carry out successful matings between pairs of genetically male or genetically female Volvox.

Here can be seen dishes containing various genders of the multicellular algae Volvox. Top left is a regular male, and top right a regular female. Bottom left is a male made to act as a female, and vice versa in the bottom right. The research could explain the origin of the sexes

The discovery of a master regulatory gene for sexes and mating types in this group of green algae shows that these two forms of reproduction share a common genetic origin.

This also hints at a similar evolutionary scenario that may have taken place in the origin of sexes in animals, plants and other multicellular lineages.

In addition to the evolutionary insights gained by Dr Umen's research team, there are also practical implications for algal biotechnology.

'Just as is the case for crop plants, breeding will be an important tool for making improved algal strains that can serve as biofuel feed stocks or other purposes,' Dr Umen,

'However, sexual reproduction in most algal species is poorly understood.

'The identification of a conserved regulatory gene that controls sex and mating in the algae may lead to clues about how sex is controlled in other related groups of algae that are used for biotechnological applications.'
