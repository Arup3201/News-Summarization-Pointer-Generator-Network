A dress believed to be the custom gown taken from Lupita Nyong'o's hotel room earlier this week has been recovered, a sheriff's official said on Friday.

Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says the dress found on Friday afternoon at a West Hollywood hotel 'greatly resembles' the pearl-adorned Calvin Klein Collection by Francisco Costa dress Nyong'o wore to Sunday's Academy Awards. 

Speaking about the discovery on Saturday, Nyong'o said to Women's Wear Daily: 'I'm happy that it has been potentially recovered. It's a timeless and priceless piece of art.'

Returned:  Lupita Nyongo's' $150,000 Oscars dress has been returned to her West Hollywood hotel, pictured at the Academy Awards

Lupita's dress was found stashed in a bathroom at The London hotel in West Hollywood. The thief called TMZ to say he had returned it after claiming the pearls it was make of are fake

Police recovered the dress and are investigating the case

Meanwhile the Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman adds that detectives are attempting to verify the recovered dress is the same one Nyong'o wore.

'We do have possession of a dress that greatly reassembles the dress that was stolen but I don't think at this time we can 100 percent say it's that dress, but it greatly resembles it,' Nishida said.

One of the actress' representatives reported the dress was stolen from Nyong'o's room at the London Hotel in West Hollywood late Wednesday. Authorities said it could have been taken during a broad time frame earlier in the day.

Authorities placed its value at $150,000, although experts say it could have fetched more on the black market.

A special dress: The custom Calvin Klein gown reportedly featured 6,000 pearls and was taken from Lupita's room at the London Hotel sometime on Tuesday

The recovery of the dress was first reported by celebrity website TMZ, which wrote in a post that a person claiming to have taken the gown gave them information about where to find the dress.

The dress recovered on Friday afternoon was found in an abandoned bathroom at the London Hotel, sheriff's officials wrote in a press release, after it was believed to have been thrown off the balcony.

Nyong'o won an Oscar in 2014 for her role in Twelve Years a Slave and was a presenter at Sunday's ceremony. Her publicists declined comment on Friday evening.

The 31-year-old actress has become a darling of Hollywood's red carpets in the past two years, with commenters and fans praising her fashion choices. She accessorized the dress with Chopard diamond drop earrings and three Chopard diamond rings.

Before the awards ceremony, Nyong'o told The Associated Press on the red carpet, 'I'm just wearing my diamonds and pearls. My homage to Prince,' referring to a popular song by the musician.

'There are a lot of collectors out there who are very private and have private collections of stolen merchandise,' said style expert and fashion commentator Mary Alice Stephenson. 'Some of these dresses have global fame as big as any Van Gogh.'  

Scene of the crime: TMZ reported that the dress was likely taken from The London Hotel between 8am and 9pm while the actress was out on Tuesday

The dress had been reported missing on Tuesday, with Lupita telling police it must have been taken from her room between 8 am and 9 pm, while she was out.

The London also confirmed the incident, saying: 'This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and we are working with law enforcement on their investigation.'

On Wednesday the actress shared a timelapse video of her pre-Oscars prep which shows her with her style team in her hotel room getting her glammed up  before the big event.

And the morning after the Oscars, Lupita shared a snap of her beautiful accessories she'd worn for the night and captioned: 'That was cool! #Oscars 2015 #DiamondsAndPearls'

Laid out on top of her frock were some stunning Chopard jewels and satin Nicholas Kirkwood heels alongside a silver box clutch. 

Lupita returned to the Oscars after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress last year for her work in 12 Years A Slave. 

'This year the pressure's off,' Lupita told E! host Ryan Seacrest during the E! red carpet show. She added: I can just dress up and enjoy the show' 

The actress was recently attached to the film Queen Of Katwe based on the true story of Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi.
