Accused: Pensioner Bob Hewling and his pet dog Monty

A pensioner who was accused of letting his dog foul on a public beach has been cleared by a court of any wrongdoing in just 10 minutes.

The £1,000 cost of the failed dog fouling prosecution - which included a trip to the seaside - has been branded 'ridiculous'.

Shih Tzu owner and respectable pensioner Bob Hewling, 71, had been accused of allowing his dog to defecate on the beach in Redcar, Cleveland.

So in a bizarre move, magistrates visited the soggy beach on a wet Friday nine months after the alleged dog fouling.

The visit was requested by Redcar and Cleveland Council, who were attempting to prosecute Mr Hewling for the alleged mess.

The three magistrates were joined by Mr Hewling, the prosecutor, defence lawyer, court clerk and community protection officer - and the dog in question, Monty.

Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard how Monty was allegedly seen 'doing his business' on Redcar beach last September.

Community protection officer James Sexton told the court he was '100 per cent sure' he had seen the dog fouling the beach. Giving evidence, he told the magistrates:

'I witnessed the faeces leaving the dog.'

Denial: The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag

But Mr Hewling was equally adamant that his beloved pet had not fouled.

The pensioner, who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing, insisted Monty had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag.

He told the court: 'I had my bag in my hand ready to pick it up. There was nothing there at all, I am sure.'

In fact the former British Steel and ICI worker said he took a dim view of dog fouling, adding: 'I don’t like it at all.'

He said he always cleaned up after his dog and even after other people’s dogs.

The court heard that Mr Hewling was given the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty notice but declined.

He told the magistrates it was 'a matter of principle'.

He said: 'If I thought Monty had done it I would have paid the fine a long time ago.'

Mr Hewling, of High Street, Eston, Cleveland, has no previous convictions.

His solicitor Gary Wood said the pensioner had never been in a courtroom before - apart from jury service and receiving a bravery award for rescuing a man from a river.

The only time Mr Hewling had been in a police station was to hand in some lost money and World Cup tickets, said Mr Wood.

Taking just 10 minutes to find him not guilty, chair of the bench Pamela Ross said they believed the officer had 'made an honest mistake'.

After the case Mr Hewling said: 'I feel relieved it is all over and done with.

'It was very tempting to pay the fine but it is the principle. I knew the dog hadn’t done anything.'

Wife Ann, 68, said: 'It has been really stressful for both of us.

'I haven’t been sleeping properly for the last few months, neither has my husband.

'I think it is ridiculous, it is not right. It was a waste of public money. It shouldn’t have gone as far as it did.'

Mr Wood said: 'I would expect it would cost in excess of £1,000. It has taken a full day’s worth of magistrates’ time. It has proved costly.'

A Redcar and Cleveland Council spokesman declined to comment on the cost of the case.

He said: 'We do take the issue of dog fouling extremely seriously as it has regularly been highlighted by residents as one of their main concerns.

However, on this occasion, a mistake has clearly been made and we would like to apologise for any distress that was caused.'
