A few short years ago, we would be more accustomed to seeing her adorning lads' mags with platinum blonde locks and lashings of fake tan.

But, it seems, Katie Price is a new woman - and she's set on conquering the high fashion world.

The Celebrity Big Brother star was barely recognisable as she strutted her stuff in an androgynous tuxedo on the Fashion For Relief catwalk on Thursday night.

Katie Price rocked a statement look on the catwalk at Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief show last night. Hair stylist Matt Roskell was keen to prove to the fashion world that she can be fierce

The 36-year-old joined fellow celebrities to walk in supermodel Naomi Campbell's show, which raised money for the fight against Ebola.

FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the show to meet the team in charge of giving the stars - including Katie - a high fashion makeover. 

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the 36-year-old said of her androgynous look: 'I was totally up for the team giving me a new different look for the catwalk.'

Luckily for Katie, hair stylist Matt Roskell, from Francesco Group Weeping Cross, was keen to do just that.

'I have always thought Katie Price was incredibly beautiful but I always thought the tan, hair extensions, fake eyelashes detracted from rather than enhanced her beauty,' he said.

'I was really excited, if a bit nervous, about being assigned to Katie but felt this was an amazing opportunity to show her and the fash pack how fierce she can actually look.'

Matt, who worked alongside the Wella Professionals team, had a blast backstage with Katie - and found her a dream to work with.

'She was super lovely and although it took a little bit of reassurance, once she was on-board with my vision and agreed to it, she walked the catwalk with a confidence I haven't seen in her in a long time.'

The inspiration for the look was the work of artist Patrick Nagel, who did the cover of the Duran Duran Rio album cover and inspired the Robert Palmer Addicted To Love video models.

As lead hair stylist Johnnie Sapong explained, Naomi and the team wanted to create a 'structured glamour' and 'refined elegance' to complement the lavish designs on the catwalk.

'It's all about effortless glamour,' said Johnnie. 'We are creating structured ponytails with a high shine finish'.

Matt added: 'It is such a strong aesthetic and Katie has such a great strong face she totally rocked it.' 

Katie was joined by The Duchess of York, Jourdan Dunn, Pixie Lott, and a string of other celebrities at the fundraiser in London's Somerset House.

Some of the world's best known fashion houses, including Dolce & Gabbana, Stella McCartney, and Vivienne Westwood, donated items for the show.

Brit Award nominee Ella Eyre performed her single 'Gravity' to a packed crowd, who also took part in an auction of luxury goods.

Lots included an exclusive holiday to the Maldives, A Bvlgari Watch and an Alexander McQueen dress.

All funds raised on the night will go to raise vital funds and awareness towards the fight against Ebola.

Industry stalwart Naomi said: 'Tonight has been incredible and I am so thankful to everyone who has been involved to make the show such a brilliant success. 

'The fight to raise awareness and bring aid to those affected by Ebola is a cause that I am so passionate about.

'I sincerely hope the funds raised from tonight's show will hopefully make a difference to those affected by this terrible disease.'
