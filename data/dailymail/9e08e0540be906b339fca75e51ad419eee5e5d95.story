Two more police forces have been caught asking British newsagents which sold copies of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for details of the customers who bought it.

Officers from Wales and Cheshire police have approached shopkeepers and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine, according to reports.

It comes after police in Wiltshire caused outrage by demanding similar details be handed over in the wake of the Paris attacks.

It appears that The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) was handed a list of Charlie Hebdo's UK stockists  by John Menzies, one of the the magazine's UK distributors.

ACPO then alerted forces who had shops selling Charlie Hebdo in their area, saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale. 

According to an ACPO spokesman, the alert suggested that police may wish to visit the shops involved, but only if there were signs of rising tensions. 

A Wiltshire Police officer visited  a small newsagents and post office in Wiltshire and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured), which was the subject of a terrorist attack. Now it has emerged that officers in Wales and Cheshire have also approached shopkeepers

The ACPO advice did not recommend visiting each shop, and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication, according to the spokesman.

It would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice, or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers.

John Menzies initially denied leaking information to the police, but since ACPO issued a statement to the contrary, they have refused to comment. 

Smiths News, another Charlie Hebdo distributor, has also refused to comment. The move has been branded 'entirely unacceptable' by privacy campaigners. 

An ACPO spokesman said: 'John Menzies, as the distributor for Charlie Hebdo within the UK, provided the police service, through the National Counter-Terrorism Policing HQ, with a list of outlets which were stocking the edition of Charlie Hebdo released following the Paris atrocities.

'This was done so that local officers could be aware of any potential tensions on their beat arising from the sales of the magazine, given the situation following the killings.

'At no point was any guidance given from a national level to forces asking them to act on the information passed over by John Menzies, and no national advice was given to forces that they should visit stockists or ask them for further information.

'Some newsagents may have been visited by officers seeking to provide reassurance to business owners but decisions on doing so will have been made at a local level.

'The police service’s duty in this matter is to protect the communities it serves and defuse tensions where they exist.' 

Paul Merrett, 57, owner of a newsagent in Presteigne, Wales, said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them.

He said: 'They wanted to know where we had got them from, and did we know who we had sold them to. 

Wiltshire Police has since apologised for the incident and said the officer's motivation was 'purely around enhancing public safety'. The force said that information obtained during the visit had been 'disposed of'

'[My wife] said she wasn't prepared to give any names. She thought we were in trouble for selling them originally, but they said we weren't, and they just wanted to know who bought them.

'We didn't give them any details. It was all very strange. There were a couple of customers in here at the time, so it soon got around town.'

A Dyfed-Powys police spokesman said: 'As part of ongoing community engagement and following recent terrorism incidents globally Dyfed Powys Police have been undertaking an assessment of community tensions across the force area.

'As part of this assessment it was decided that it would be prudent to visit newsagents who maybe distributing the Charlie Hebdo magazine to offer proportionate advice and reassurance due to the heightened publicity surrounding the publication. 

'It was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded.Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance.'

The Guardian reports that in Warrington, Cheshire, a police officer also called a newsagent that had sold the copy, and asked for information on the customer. 

But Cheshire police denied this was the case. 

A spokesman said: 'Officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

'Each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we cannot provide an exact figure.'

Anne Keat, 77, was among those who ordered a copy of the publication  and said she was 'baffled' by police wanting the names of those who bought it

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence.

'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication.

'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.'

Wiltshire officers asked at least three newsagents for people's details.

The force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of Corsham who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front.

Earlier this week David Jones, 63, was told by his local shop in Beddau, Pontypridd, that an officer had asked for his name after he bought a copy for his 21-year-old son, who studied French at university.

He said: 'I am astounded that this intrusion has occurred and wonder what right the police have to check up on what I and others are reading. 

'Surely their time would be better spent hunting deranged people who want to behead citizens on our streets.'

He said his newsagent told him that anther stockist in a nearby town had also been asked about Charlie Hebdo customers.

'I cannot fathom out what link they think exists between a local person in a small town in South Wales, a satirical French magazine and some terrorists,' he said.

'Trust in the police is low and this type of official or unofficial snooping on private individuals will not improve the situation. They are acting like the Stasi.'

Grandmother Ann Keat, 77, was also told by her newsagent in Corsham that police had asked for her name, and the names of others who had ordered Charlie Hebdo.

The retired nurse said: 'I was cross – what's wrong with me wanting to buy it? It's an intrusion, and in terms of free speech it's worrying really.' 

Hundreds of Britons queued for a copy of the £3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine, published following last month's attack by Islamic extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead. 

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech. 

Twelve people were killed when gunmen (pictured) stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7

The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message

'It is therefore alarming that overzealous police officers are attempting to find out who has bought a perfectly legal publication. We have to hope that these are isolated cases.'

Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights organisation Liberty, said the officers 'may have had good intentions, but the road to oppression is paved that way'.

Wiltshire Police said it had carried out an 'assessment of community tensions' after the Paris attacks. As part of this, officers were asked to be 'mindful' of newsagents that were stocking the magazine.

A spokesman said: 'A police officer visited a local shop and post office in Corsham to make an assessment of community tensions ... during this conversation the officer requested information about subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine.

'Wiltshire Police would like to apologise to the members of public who may be affected. [This information] has been permanently and securely disposed of.'

A spokesman for South Wales Police said they were 'not currently aware of anything regarding the incident'.
