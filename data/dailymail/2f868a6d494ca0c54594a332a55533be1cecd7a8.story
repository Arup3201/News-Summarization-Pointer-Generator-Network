There are numerous fascinating experiments taking place on the International Space Station (ISS) at any time, including efforts to monitor how plants grow in space.

But a tree that was grown from a cherry pit that travelled into space five years ago and is now back in solid ground is baffling scientists after it bloomed far earlier than its terrestrial counterparts.

The tree made the trip 229 mile (370km) above the Earth around five years ago with astronaut Koichi Wakata, who is now commander of the ISS.

The pit sent to space was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250-year-old Chujohimeseigan-zakura cherry tree (pictured), which grows in the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, which lies to the east of Kyoto, Japan

Scientists were astonished when it bloomed much earlier than normal cherry trees, which typically don’t produce blossom for a decade.

The pit was one of around 265 produced from the fruit of a famous 1,250-year-old Chujohimeseigan-zakura cherry tree, which grows in the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, which lies to the east of Kyoto.

The tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century.

At nearly £14,000 ($23,000) to send a kilogram of food into space, cosmic cuisine doesn’t come cheap. 

But Nasa hopes that in the future it can grow vast quantities of its own food in space.

As well as cutting costs, Nasa is hoping a 'space farm' will  deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions.

It could also provide something called ‘horticultural therapy’ for astronauts to reduce stress, alleviate depression and improve their overall general health.

The work is part of the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink LED lamps.

Nasa claims that after extensive testing on plants on Earth, it doesn’t expect zero-gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants.

The Chujohimeseigan-zakura tree is a type of the wild cherry species which is notoriously difficult to grow.

The Asahi Shimbun reported that until now the ‘space cherry’ attempts to grow young trees from the pits have been unsuccessful.

But by covering soil with sphagnum moss, 78-year-old botanist Takao Yoshimura managed to get one of the pits from the ISS to sprout.

And remarkably in four years, the young plants was already 13ft (four metres) high. It produced 10 buds, which bloomed last week, some four years before expected.

Mr Yoshimura said that it usually takes at least a decade for young cherry trees to flower and that other trees that have grown from the pits from the ISS have also bloomed, perhaps suggesting that their extraordinary journey has somehow accelerated their growth.

All the pits were planted in Kochi and Yamanashi in the hope that they might flower one day.

The cherry pit came from the Ganjoji temple, in Higashiomi, Japan. The tree which produced the pits - that were blasted into space in 2008 and returned a year later - is said to originate from the seventh century

Botanist Kaori Tomita, of the University of Tsukuba, who was involved in the space experiment does not know why the space cherries are thriving.

‘There is a theoretical possibility that the cosmic environment has had a certain impact on agents in the seeds that control budding and the growth process, but we have absolutely no answer as to why the trees have come into bloom so fast,’ she said.

Intriguingly, while each flower of the parent tree has around 30 petals, the ‘space cherry’ blooms only have five petals.

‘As it is grown from a seed, the young plant might have reverted back to have the characteristics of original yamazakura species,’ Dr Yoshimura said, before hypothesising that the number of petals on each flower might increase as the tree matures.
