A 15-year-old girl was locked out of her family home and forced to live in a shed with a bed made of cinderblocks for nearly two months, police in Ohio have revealed. 

The helpless teenager eventually tried to reach out to her neighbor - begging for food and asking her to meet outside her family home in Bloom Township. 

Officers said her parents forced her to live in a shelter that had no lights, no water, or a toilet, because she had tried to sneak into their bedroom to use the computer. 

Squalid: A 15-year-old girl was locked out of her family and forced to live in this shed outside her family home in Ohio as punishment, police have revealed 

According to the Columbus Dispatch, the girl’s parents, Douglas L. Sherman and Kim Sherman, have been charged with child abuse.

When neighbor Kim Wilkinson alerted the authorities, they searched the premises and found a 12ft by 5ft shed attached to the back of the house.

Inside was a bed made of concrete blocks underneath a cardboard roof supported by plywood. The youngster was also forced to wash outside and was not allowed to go eat with her family.

She was also reportedly made to do manual labor which included moving dirt around the garden.  

Their daughter and her brother, who also is 15, have been placed in the care of county Child Protective Services. 

Mr. Sherman, 64, pleaded not guilty on Friday to child endangering and intimidation, and to misdemeanor charges of telephone harassment and menacing. Mrs. Sherman, 60, pleaded not guilty to child endangering.

Both are free on bond, and are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Friday in Fairfield County Municipal Court.

Arrested: The girl’s parents, Douglas L. Sherman, 64, and Kim Sherman, 60 have been charged with child abuse
