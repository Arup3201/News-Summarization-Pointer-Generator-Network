The father of the missing Missouri mother of triplets who has been missing since last month has claimed that her estranged husband 'threatened her for a year'.

Stan Rawson, the father of 39-year-old Jacque Sue Waller, who was last seen on June 1, made explosive claims against his son-in-law saying he has no doubt he is responsible for her disappearance.

Mrs Waller's husband James 'Clay Waller' is the only 'person of interest' named in the case and this week was accused of mocking search volunteers and obstructing the investigation.

Explosive claims: Stan and Ruby Rawson said they have 'no doubt' that their son in law was involved in their daughter's disappearance

He was the last person to see his wife when she went to his home to pick up one of their children, Maddox, around 4pm.

Her car was then found abandoned three miles from his home and her business cards found eight miles away from there just last week.

In an interview with Fox news, Mr Rawson said: 'He’s not acting at all like someone whose wife came up missing.

'They’ve got him. All they need is her body.'

Mr Rawson said Waller, a former police officer, used their son Maddox to lure his wife to his home to kill her.

Clay Waller told police that he had an argument with his wife after a divorce hearing earlier that day but that she walked away.

He has denied any involvement in her disappearance and has accused police - who suspect foul play - of conducting a witch hunt against him.

Mrs Waller's mother Ruby Rawson said it is like a 'nightmare that never ends'.

Mr Rawson claims his wife kept a diary on her company computer that detailed the threats made by her husband.

Jackson Police Chief James Humphreys told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that Mr Waller is 'not cooperating the way we hope he would'.

He said authorities suspect foul play and believe it may have been a scene staged to look like an abduction.

Speaking for the first time: James 'Clay' Waller said that he wants his estranged wife, who has been missing for seven weeks, to come home safely

Vanished: Jacque Sue Waller disappeared on June 1 shortly after visiting her husband at the home he was temporarily living in

Speaking for the first time since the 
investigation began, Mr Waller said today that he just wanted for the mother 
of his children to be found alive.

‘I want her to come home alive,’ he said. ‘I just miss my wife and my kids… we’re just trying to fight to see them.’

Authorities have blocked Mr Waller from seeing his five-year-old triplets since Mrs Waller went missing.

‘I can't change how people feel. I 
mean there's a lot of emotions that are running high right now with 
this...We're all just sad, just sad on both sides of the fence here,’ Mr
Waller told ABC News.

Mr Waller’s lawyer denied the 
accusations about his client. ‘He has cooperated,’ Scott Douglas 
Reynolds told the Huffington Post.

Accused: Waller has not joined in on efforts to find Jacque, one neighbour alleges

Missing: Jacque Waller disappeared seven weeks ago

Jacque Sue Waller was reported 
missing June 1 shortly after visiting with her husband at a home in 
Jackson, Missouri, where he was temporarily living during the couple's 
divorce proceedings.

Mrs
Waller, who has five-year-old triplets, had just attended a divorce 
hearing when she drove to her husband's home at around 4:00pm to pick up
her son, Maddox.

But the child was not at the home when Mrs Waller arrived and family members say they believe her husband, a former police officer, lured her to the home to kill her.

Police found Jacque Waller's blue 
Honda Pilot abandoned along Interstate 55 in Missouri the morning after 
she was reported missing.

Her purse, keys and cellphone were not found inside the vehicle.

Officers said there has been no activity on her credit cards and phone since her disappearance.

Mrs Waller's parents have encouraged rumours that blood was found in the house where Mr Waller was staying.

Her father Stan Rawson said reports of blood are true.

Claims: James 'Clay' Waller claims he's being falsely accused over his wife's disappearance

Blocked: Authorities have stopped Mr Waller from having contact with his three children

'I've seen it' he said. 'But that's all I'm going to confirm. There's a ton of evidence... Just suffice to say there is blood evidence. I saw the evidence bags.'

Last
week, a woman reported finding Mrs Waller's Blue Cross Blue Shield business
cards along another state highway about eight miles from where her car 
was recovered.

Mrs Waller worked as a manager for the health insurance company.

Mr
Humphreys said on Tuesday that police searched the home where Clay 
Waller was temporarily living within 72 hours of the investigation.

He said detectives also uncovered 
valuable information from the woman's computer that he described only as
'personal diary type' in nature.

Laura
Helbig, a family friend and volunteer, told Fox News on Wednesday that 
Mr Waller hasn't participated in the hunt for his wife and said he's 
been seen mocking volunteers out on searches.

Miss Helbig said Waller would 'blow kisses, laugh, and flip us off' when driving by in his car during searches for Mrs Waller.

'I don't think this is the face or demeanour of a man who thinks his beloved wife needs to be found,' Miss Helbig said.
