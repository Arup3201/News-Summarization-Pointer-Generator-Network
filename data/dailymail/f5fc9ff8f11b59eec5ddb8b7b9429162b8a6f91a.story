A married special constable hanged herself in her uniform after becoming pregnant by her college tutor, an inquest heard.

Mother-of-one Tammy Paterson, 24, was torn between her husband of three years, Ian, and her course lecturer, John Lewis, 36.

When she discovered she was pregnant 
the student killed herself after sending the same text to both her 
estranged husband and lover, which simply said: ‘I am going to die, 
sorry.’

Mrs Paterson, who had just qualified as a special constable, was found hanged in her police issue trousers, blouse and hat in a bedroom at her home.

At an inquest into her death, coroner John Gittins said it was a tragic waste of a young life and described her suicide as a ‘very, very sad case’.

The hearing was told Lithuanian-born Tatjana Vitaite – known as Tammy – had moved to the UK some years ago and began working in a factory in North Wales.

She met fellow worker Ian Paterson at
the factory and romance blossomed between them. They married in 2009 
and had a daughter. In September 2011 Mrs Paterson started a public 
service course at Deeside College, North Wales, and also began training 
as a special constable.

Mr Paterson, 28, of Sandycroft, North
Wales told the inquest he and his wife split up in May last year though
they tried for a reconciliation before finally separating.

Tammy Paterson's text to husband Ian Paterson and lover John Lewis

‘She said we should have a break from
each other,’ he explained. But he added the reconciliation did not work
out and he finally moved out of their home for good.

Mr Lewis told the inquest: ‘I was 
aware she was married with a child. She confided in me about her 
problems. She felt she could trust me. I was aware that she was having 
problems in her marriage.

‘I believed she left her husband. She
asked me if things were different, would I date her?’ He said he told 
her he couldn’t because they were teacher and student.

But the inquest at North East Wales 
Coroner’s Court in Mold heard the pair later started an affair after 
their ‘relationship changed’.

Mr Lewis told the hearing: ‘Things 
happened which should not have’ and claimed both of them were extremely 
vulnerable at the time.

The lecturer said the relationship 
only grew in the last weeks of her college course and claimed he loved 
her and he wanted to be with her.

'Things happened which should not have - we were both vulnerable at the time'

John Lewis, lover

Within weeks of finishing the public 
services course she told him she was pregnant and claimed she wanted the
baby and also wanted to have a future with him.

But she then changed 
her mind and said she wanted an abortion and intended to continue with 
her career. Mr Lewis said he supported her in her decision. ‘We were 
hoping for a future together,’ he said.

Mr Paterson said he was aware of his 
wife’s relationship with her college lecturer and she told him she was 
pregnant with Mr Lewis’s child.

On July 5 last year Mrs Paterson went
for a medical assessment and was then scheduled to have an abortion the
following Monday. But the following day she failed to respond to 
repeated calls from her lover.

Last words: On the day Tammy Paterson killed herself she sent text messages saying she was going to die

Happier days: Tammy Paterson had been sworn in as a special constable with North Wales Police and had received her uniform - but had not started her duties

He went to an Asda supermarket where she had been employed part-time to see her but was told she had not arrived for work.

Then at 2.05pm he received the text 
saying: ‘I am going to die, sorry.’ Frantic with worry, Mr Lewis and his
brother rushed round to her house in Connah’s Quay, North Wales where 
they discovered her body.

Mr Lewis said: ‘I never imagined she would feel that this was the only way of dealing with her emotions.’

Mr Paterson said he also received a 
text from her saying: ‘I am going to die, sorry’ as well as another in 
the days before her death which said: ‘I still love you.’

The coroner, who recorded a verdict 
of suicide, described Mrs Paterson as ‘quite a troubled soul’ and said 
she had a traumatic childhood in Lithuania, where her stepfather had 
been murdered.
