A mother addicted to alcohol while pregnant says she feels guilty every single day for the damage she has caused her daughter.

Linda McFadden, 49, drank eight cans of lager a day while carrying daughter Claire - and says she was powerless to stop.

As a result, Claire, who weighed just 2lb when she was born, has endured a lifetime of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which has caused her both mental and physical difficulties.

The condition occurs when an unborn baby is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to a high blood alcohol concentration.

Addiction: Linda McFadden, 49, drank eight cans of lager a day while carrying daughter Claire - and says she was powerless to stop

Damaged: As a result of her mother's drinking, Claire, who weighed just 2lb when she was born, has endured a lifetime of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome 

That limits the growth of white matter in the baby's brain, potentially causing learning difficulties. 

Signs that a baby is suffering from the syndrome include small and narrow eyes, a small head, a smooth area between the nose and the lips and a thin upper lip. 

Claire, now 20, has also been left with facial deformities and learning disabilities due to her mother's behaviour while pregnant.

Speaking on ITV'S This Morning, Mrs McFadden, who has now been dry for 14 years, said:  'I knew it was my fault and I will always feel guilty. 

'I was an addict - I couldn't control it - I needed a drink to get me through the day.' 

Despite drinking while pregnant with her first child, Sarah, Mrs McFadden admits her alcohol consumption was heavier when she was carrying Claire.   

She told the show's hosts, Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'I must have been aware that alcohol wasn't good while you are pregnant, but I didn't know what damage it could cause.'

She admits she developed tricks to mask her heavy drinking from friends, family and her husband, David.

'If anyone came to see me, I had a spot in the kitchen where I'd hide the can. There were cans of lager hidden around everywhere. I'm sure people knew.'

Foetal alcohol syndrome occurs where an unborn baby is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to a high blood alcohol concentration.

That limits the growth of white matter in the baby's brain, potentially causing learning difficulties.

A lack of oxygen between weeks six and nine of pregnancy can also cause facial deformities while the baby's features form, while drinking in the first three months can cause organ damage.

Signs that a baby is suffering from the syndrome include small and narrow eyes, a small head, a smooth area between the nose and the lips and a thin upper lip. 

Babies diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol syndrome (FAS) are also known to suffer birth defects.

These include a smaller head circumference, heart problems, limb damage, kidney damage, damage to the brain, eye problems, hearing problems and specific facial characteristics.

They are also prone to suffering learning difficulties, memory problems, hyperactivity and poor problem-solving skills.

She believes the problem began as early as 17, when she started going to the pub - and really enjoyed the way drinking made her feel.

And moving out of home gave her the opportunity to drink whenever she liked.

'I was drinking eight cans of lager a day, which is around 100 units a week, and maintained that for more than 15 years, but never considered myself an alcoholic,' she told The Sun newspaper.

'It was tough juggling a newborn and drinking, but the stress of trying to cut back would've been impossible.'

'I'd wake up and feel so nauseous I'd vomit, then crack open a beer at 8am.' 

Mrs McFadden's heavy drinking meant Claire was born two months early and weighing less than 2lb.

She was given less than a 50 per cent chance of survival after being delivered by emergency Caesearean section because she had stopped moving. 

Her mother admits she broke down with the shame of what she had done to her baby daughter. 

'Of course I blamed myself - I came home crying as deep down, I knew it was my fault. 

'But we couldn't do anything about it - we had to live with it. I have carried the guilt for years. ' 

Suffering: Today, Claire works as a PA, but says her school years were a nightmare - mainly because there was so little awareness about Foetal Alcohol Syndrome

Indeed, her drinking has left Claire with a lifetime legacy of physical and learning issues. 

It took nine months for her to reach the weight of a newborn, and she didn't walk until she was two or speak until she was three. 

Today, Claire works as a PA, but says her school years were a nightmare - mainly because there was so little awareness about Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.  

'No one really knew anything about it - people just treated me differently and didn't take into account I had this condition,' she told Ruth and Eamonn. 

'I was really shy, I wouldn't - and couldn't socialise - and my memory wasn't good.'

For her mother, every day was a reminder of the terrible damage she had caused - something which affected the pair's relationship for a long time. 

'When Mum first told me about the alcohol, I was very angry - I did blame her a lot, all the time,' Claire told This Morning. 

'But as I've got older, I completely understand - I can't blame her.' 

Commenting on the issue, This Morning's Dr Dawn Harper urged other pregnant women with alcohol problems not to suffer in silence. 

She said: 'Don't be ashamed - admitting you have a problem is the brave thing to do.'

Honest: Speaking on ITV'S This Morning, Mrs McFadden, who has now been dry for 14 years, said: 'I knew it was my fault and I will always guilty. 'I was an addict - I couldn't control it'

The number of babies being born with foetal alcohol syndrome caused by mothers drinking while pregnant has increased by almost 40 per cent in the last three years.

Between 2012 and 2013 doctors treated 252 cases of the syndrome, which can cause learning difficulties, organ damage and facial deformity, in England alone.

Susan Fleisher, chief executive of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, said recently: 'There have been studies in Italy and the US that say that between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of the population is affected by this.

'And, remember, Britain is the number one binge-drinking country in Europe. The chances are we are closer to 5 per cent, although we can't say that for sure because it is under-diagnosed and difficult to diagnose.'

And earlier month, an MP said women should not drink any alcohol while they are pregnant because of the risks to their unborn child.

Bill Esterson wants it to be made compulsory for all alcoholic beverages to carry compulsory warning labels directed at expectant mothers.

Presenting his Alcohol Labeling (Pregnancy) Bill, the Labour MP for Sefton Central on Merseyside told MPs that 7,000 children a year were born in the UK damaged by alcohol, equating to one in every 100 births.

He said: 'Mild brain damage can be caused to children by even small amounts of alcohol at the wrong time during pregnancy, especially in the early stages when an embryo does not have the protection of a blood stream.

 'Much scientific evidence suggests that there is no safe limit when it comes to drinking in pregnancy but sadly not everyone is aware of the dangers.'
