Throughout history, fireworks have been used to celebrate historic moments in time - from the dominance of the Tang Dynasty to the declaration of independence and the intervention of the gunpowder plot.

Popularity for the explosive displays rose during the 18th century and an archived manuscript has revealed how amateur makers would have created their own fireworks at home.

The 232-page book, titled Artificial Fireworks, was produced in 1785 and features step-by-step instructions, tables of work and diagrams.

The 232-page book, (pictured) titled Artificial Fireworks, was produced in 1785 and later archived by California-based Getty Institute. It was handwritten by John Maskell and each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks

Each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks, including the Fruiloni and Vertical Wheels, and Sky and Caduceus Rockets.

For example, the Friulion Wheel is made of beech wood using two, 2oz (56g) cases made from clay, joined together with 12 spokes; six on the top and six on the bottom.

The common 'fire' used in the cases consists of 1lb (453g) of 'Healed Powder', 4oz (113g) of saltpetre, 2oz (56g) of sulphur and 4oz (113g) of charcoal.

Iron filings were also added to the cases, which had to be ‘very clean and bright.’

The book also advises sifting the powders through a hair sieve.

One Vertical Wheel is designed to celebrate the marriage of King George III and the teenage Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and features a tin crown (pictured) on top

According to the manual, Vertical Wheels are ‘likewise calculated for 2oz cases’, and are ‘nearly the same size as Fruiloni, but the block is not so long and the spokes are only turned so as just to clear the cases and give room for communicating, typing and pasting.’

One Vertical Wheel in the book has even been  designed to celebrate the marriage of King George III and the teenage Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and features a tin crown on top of the structure.

Maskell also reveals the best way to create Sky Rockets and states that although military moulds are made of brass, wooden moulds ‘answer very well.’

Paper and powder are then rolled and placed inside circular tubes to form the finished rocket.

Maskell also advises against cutting shapes on a table, so not to ‘spoil’ the surfaces.

Fireworks can be traced back to ancient China, around the time of the Han Dynasty between 206 and 220 BC.

During that period, it was discovered that when rods of bamboo were lit on fire, they began to crackle and eventually exploded.

People
 were said to have found the noise so terrifying, they would use 'pao 
chuk', or ‘bursting bamboo’, to frighten away evil spirits.

Later,
 during the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420 to 581), these 
rudimentary firecrackers were employed as invocations for happiness and 
prosperity.

The
 Chinese discovery of gunpowder – generally believed to be in the Sui 
and Tang Dynasties (581-907) – fuelled the first ‘modern’ 
fireworks, which were initially created using bamboo.

By
 the 13th century, the Chinese military had developed the ‘ground rat,’ 
which fired gas from one end to shoot the ‘rat’ across the floor. 

Fireworks
 remained popular in Asia until 1292, when explorer Marco 
Polo is credited as taking the invention to Italy.

Italians 
were the first to create popular varieties of fireworks, including 
‘fountains,’ ‘spinners,’ ‘cones,’ ‘wheels,’ ‘Roman candles’ and 
‘sparklers.’

A
 year after the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, in which Guy Fawkes failed to 
assassinate King James I of England, parliament declared the anniversary an annual 
event and bonfires and fireworks are still used to make the occasion (pictured above).

By
 the 18th century, firework displays had spread to the UK and around 
Europe, where makers used black-powder firecrackers to celebrate special
 occasions.

When
 the original thirteen American colonies declared their independence from 
England, fireworks played a central part in celebrating the occasion. 

The first Fourth of July festivities took place in 1777, a year after the Declaration of Independence was signed.
