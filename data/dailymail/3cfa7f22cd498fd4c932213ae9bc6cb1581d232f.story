Father of the bride: Chris Evans walked his daughter, Jade, down the aisle as she married mechanic boyfriend Callum

He may be the king of the airwaves but Chris Evans rightly let his daughter take the spotlight yesterday as he gave her away in marriage.

The Radio 2 Breakfast Show host was the proud father at the wedding of Jade, 26, and her car mechanic boyfriend Callum at a church near the broadcaster’s home in Ascot, Berkshire.

The 47-year-old personality looked smart in a navy three-piece suit and tie as he posed alongside his stunning daughter, who opted for a white lace strapless dress. 

Jade finished off her wedding day outfit with a diamond tiara, pearls and a dainty bouquet of roses.

Prior to walking Jade down the aisle, Chris admitted to onlookers that he was suffering from severe case of nerves.

One
 bystander told the Mirror: 'He looked scared and was shaking slightly.

'Someone ­commented that he looked terrified. He replied, "Yes I am. I’m 
really in a panic".'

Among 
the guests at the ceremony were Chris' wife Natasha and their two sons, 
Noah, four, and one-year-old Eli, and Jade's mother Alison Ward.

Following
 the ceremony, Jade and her new husband drove off to their reception at her father's sprawling estate in 
Chris' famous pink Rolls-Royce Ghost, to a round of applause from guests
 and onlookers.

At the reception, guests including racing driver Jason Plato and ex chairman of Liverpool FC David Moores tucked into a cake made by The Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood, who did not attend.

Jade was born when Evans was just 21.

He
 has admitted walking away from her mother Alison to pursue his career 
but since then he and his daughter have been reconciled.

In his autobiography Evans admitted 
to being a selfish p**** for walking away from his ex-wife and daughter,
 and said that while he was too focused on himself and career, Alison 
was selfless.

Evans' 
daughter Jade spoke of how disappointed she was around the time of her 
18th birthday that things weren't fully reconciled with her father, but 
now it appears they have some solid foundation.

When
 Alison made the decision to take herself and child back to her mother's
 house, Evans agreed that he wasn't ready for the responsibility, but 
did contribute financially to his daughter's upbringing.

Things
 have, however, improved over the years, with Evans stating that his 
current wife Natasha  has 
helped him maintain a relationship with his daughter.

It is believed that Jade moved into the gatehouse property on Evans' estate last year.
