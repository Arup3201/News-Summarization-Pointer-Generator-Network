A five-month-old American girl who was crushed to death on a baggage carousel at a Spanish airport died due to parental neglect, not because of the machine, the Spanish government has said.

Authorities have blamed Vashti Terry's death at Alicante Airport last year on the people supervising her. She was traveling with her mother, 32-year-old accountant Nathania Terry from Maryland.

In a statement, authorities insisted the machine was not to blame for the tragedy on September 19, and that the luggage carousel adhered to legal standards, Europa Press reported.

The statement, which came after an 
opposition politician questioned how similar tragedies would be 
prevented in the future, said that the incident was 'totally random'.

Loss: American five-month-old Vashti Terry died when she became stuck in a gap on a luggage carousel in Alicante Airport last year. The Spanish government has said those supervising her were to blame

'Blame': Nathania Terry, 32, had been holding her daughter when she slipped from her arms

It
 was 'not attributable to the installation [of the machine], designed 
for the passage of luggage and not for the movement of people... It was 
due to neglect of those who were in charge of the child'.

Nathania Terry had just landed in Spain after flying from London with her two children - Vashti and an older boy.

Police said the girl died from 
catastrophic head injuries when her mother, who was holding the baby, lost her grip as she climbed on to the carousel to retrieve a baby stroller and fell.

Her screams rang out across the arrivals hall at Alicante airport, bringing police rushing to the scene.

Airport staff said the accident happened in seconds, giving the mother no time to react.

An
 airport worker added: ‘The youngster ended up trapped in a 10cm hole 
where two belts converge. She appeared to have suffered from a 
fractured skull.’

The government statement insisted that the size of the gap - in which the little girl was crushed - complied with standards.

Vashti was declared dead at the scene by the airport's on-call doctor.

There were reports that the family had to
 wait until a judge arrived before the baby could be moved, in 
accordance with Spanish law.

Following
 the tragedy, the grieving mother's uncle told MailOnline: 'If you have 
not experienced such a tragedy in life then you cannot say you 
understand. You can only empathize with her and say that you can only 
imagine what it must be like.'

Alicante
 airport is the sixth busiest in Spain based on passenger numbers. It is
 the main airport for the province, which is a popular summer holiday 
destination.
