The father of wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay has denied testing positive for traces of marijuana while visiting his son in prison.

The family's lawyer told Daily Mail Australia: 'Nigel Baden-Clay and his family do not use illegal drugs'.

The denial follows a report in the Courier Mail which claimed drugs tests were carried out at Wolston Correctional Centre, in Wacol, Queensland on four different occasions and allegedly returned traces of the cannabis plant ingredient Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on Nigel Baden-Clay's clothing.

Visitors at the jail are reportedly usually banned for three-months from visits if they test positive three times but the bans are still at the discretion of the jail.

However, lawyer Peter Shields said: 'I know from professional experience the jail scanners are unreliable and have a history of returning false positives.'

ION scanners are used in jails as a non-intrusive search tool for inmates, staff and visitors, as well as for incoming mail and parcels. 

Mr Shields said he had spoken to the journalist who wrote the Courier Mail article and told him 'there is no real evidence to justify the story and there was no public interest in the story'.

'In the circumstances I have advised Nigel Baden-Clay and his family to consider court proceedings against the journalist for defamation,' he added. 

There is no suggestion that Nigel Baden-clay handles or uses marijuana and he is said to have told the Courier Mail he had ‘no reason’ why traces had been found on him.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Wolston Correctional Centre for comment. 

Gerard Baden-Clay killed his former beauty queen wife Allison on 19 April 2012 and dumped her body by Kholo Creek, about 13k from their Brisbane home.

Allison’s badly decomposed body was eventually found by a canoeist. 

The former real estate agent was sentenced to life for his crime and is currently serving a non-parole period of 15 years at the high-security prison, which houses 722 inmates – many of whom are paedophiles, sex offenders and murderers.

Gerard Baden-Clay is the great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the world-wide Scout Movement.

When he was sentenced the court heard that the 43-year-old was having an affair on the night his wife disappeared and had also fallen into debt.

Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, told the court that Baden-Clay had 'efficiently and effectively' killed his wife, probably by smothering her, as she fought for her life at their home.

During the struggle, he said Mrs Baden-Clay scratched her husband’s face as she tried to fight him off.

‘They are fingernail marks, they are on his face, they occurred after his children went to sleep and before his children got up,’ said the prosecutor.

‘There was a struggle between the two of them and she left her mark upon him.'

Baden-Clay’s mistress Toni McHugh later appeared on 60 Minutes and revealed how terrified she now is of the man she thought she was going to marry and once loved 'unconditionally'.

She appeared on the Channel Nine show to make it clear that Baden-Clay didn’t kill his wife Allison for her.

‘I loved him already he didn’t need to, he already had me – he killed for himself,’ she said.

In an emotional interview with 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown, Ms McHugh broke down as she explained: ‘I want this man to never, ever, ever enter my life ever again.’

'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told the show.

'He had told me that he would marry me one day.'
