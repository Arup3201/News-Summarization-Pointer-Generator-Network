Samantha Alexander is legally blind due to a genetic disease affecting her vision

Samantha Alexander was celebrating on Thursday after graduating from university - an amazing achievement considering she started losing her sight half way through her studies.

The 24-year-old suffers from a genetic disease, cone-rod dystrophy, meaning she has lost about 70 per cent of her sight.

With her vision deteriorating since 2010, Ms Alexander had her driver's licence revoked in 2011.

'It's a big ordeal,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

She started a Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justices via correspondence at Griffith University, on the Gold Coast in Queensland, towards the end of 2010.

On Thursday, she graduated with a grade point of average of 6.5 out of seven.

Ms Alexander said she faced many barriers in learning without her sight.

'I never thought I was not going to graduate... if I start something I finish it, that's my rule,' she said.

Ms Alexander had to use audio software to get information from her textbooks and worked closely with the university's disability unit. 'I had to learn a new style of learning,' she said.

She added that taking time off work to study the new learning techniques was not an option for her because she was so dedicated to a cadetship with Corrective Services NSW that she was completing. 'There was no going to a braille school,' she said.

Refusing to let her vision condition beat her, Ms Alexander, pictured with her grandmother Chris Clarke, remained determined to finish her studies

To adapt, she listened to the audio software and memorised what was said so she could type it in her own words using a computer.

Still capable of typing, she had special consideration to submit her examinations and complete her coursework by computer.

Already looking to the future, she started her Masters of Forensic Mental Health on Monday.

Ms Alexander credits landing her 'dream job' and Australian rapper 360's music for getting her through the last few years.

'He (360) has a vision impairment very similar to mine and his songs reflect his experience,' she said. '360 was my saviour'. Her only regret is not using a Starlight wish to organise a meeting with the rapper.

Ms Alexander said she became aware her vision was deteriorating in 2011.

'I knew within myself that my vision was going and I had stopped driving about a month before loosing my licence.

'The reason I knew something was wrong was I kept bumping into furniture around the house - I kept walking into things.

'I've go two degrees of peripheral vision left - it's like holding a toilet roll over the eye to create tunnel vision.'

With the remaining tunnel about the size of a 5 cent coin, she said black dots further impaired her limited sight.

'If I look at a face I scan it in sections to build pictures in my head,' she said of the fatiguing process.

In 2006, Ms Alexander enjoyed her Year 10 formal unaffected by the condition which caused her to loose most of her eye sight in 2011

'How I used to make a sandwich - everything is a struggle now,' she said. 'If I'm busy I function better, it stops the depression kicking in,' she said. 'What other choice do I have?'.

Starting a cadetship with Corrective Services NSW in 2012, Samantha lived at Emu Plains in Sydney's far west at the time and needed to catch a train to Central station.

'My biggest asset when travelling on the train and to cope with everything was listening to 360's music,' she said. 'I thought I can do this too and it's all good.'

'I was scared - it (Central station) is a busy place and if it's raining I've got two bags, an umbrella and a white cane.'

She also credits the recently completed  cadetship for Indigenous Australians for giving her direction. 'It was my dream job... the idea of helping Aboriginal inmates,' she said.

Despite the challenges she faced just getting to work, Ms Alexander said the prospect of helping others took precedent over using her cane on the train to work.

'I made contact with Guide Dogs NSW and told them I needed to start learning the travel route,' she said.

'Their advice to me was don't do it. It's a long journey and they said I need to start using it (the cane) in the backyard to get to the clothes line.'

Ms Alexander said she was advised it could take about eight years before she was capable to use public transport with a cane.

Despite disliking using a cane, she was determined not to let this stop her and said it was necessary when trying to 'combat' Central station, where it takes up to 10 minutes to navigate through the people.

'How am I going to change the world if I'm sitting on my backside watching telly,' she said. 'I'd rather be doing something more productive.

'I still do everything as normal as I can... My satisfaction in life is from helping people - I'm the go to person for family and friends.'

Despite significant vision loss Ms Alexander has moved to Gregory Hills in Sydney's south west into a home she built with the support of her carer and best friend, Nicholas Hawkins, who lives with her full time.

'He does things around the house. Meal preparation, technical stuff like cooking, He can also do my makeup and eyeliner. I was pretty lucky.'

Mr Hawkins also travelled with Samantha to her graduation ceremony.

But one of her biggest struggles has been the reaction of the public. 'When you get a cane, apparently you're famous,' she said.

'It took me 20 minutes to walk from the train through Central station to work and in that time I'd be approached by five people.'

'It made me cranky - I said to a lady in frustration, politely but crankily, about a lady in front wearing high heels: "The chick in front does not have a cane and you're not going up to her so please leave me alone unless I'm crying or severely disorientated.'

However at a later time the same woman did stop to help her when she became lost. 'I recognised her by her voice,' she said.

'People telling me they're proud to see me going to work - that commentary is not necessary. I just want to be treated as normal.

'I'm trying to get by and do what I do and don't want to be harassed or made to feel difficult.

'People came up to me and said "You poor thing". People came up and patted me when I was getting onto the train.'

While Ms Alexander is still undecided about exactly what she wants to do when she finishes her masters she wants to help the Aboriginal community, possibly in a crime and mental health welfare role.

'I want to help close the gap between white and Indigenous Australians,' she said.
