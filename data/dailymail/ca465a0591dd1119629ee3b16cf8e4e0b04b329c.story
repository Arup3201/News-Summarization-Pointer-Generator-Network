With a powerful performance as a slave owner in the Oscar-nominated 12 Years a Slave, Benedict Cumberbatch has been wowing cinema-goers.

But for a newly elected New York city official, the film resonates on a more personal level.

Stacey Cumberbatch, chief of administrative services to the city’s mayor, revealed an unlikely family link when she spoke to reporters.

Stacey Cumberbatch (left), one of New York's new commissioners, says she got her surname from the slave-owner ancestor of 12 Years A Slave actor Benedict Cumberbatch (right)

She claims that her ancestors were 
owned by the Sherlock star’s family way back in the 18th century on a 
sugar plantation on Barbados.

The
 37-year-old actor has previously told how his 
great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Abraham Cumberbatch, built 
the family fortune with a plantation on the Caribbean island.

Born in Bristol in 1726, the slave owner came from a family of merchants and adventurers and died in 1785.

Cumberbatch
 has said that his surname became common among families in the Caribbean
 as slaves often used to take the name of their masters.

Miss
 Cumberbatch was born in the gritty New York borough of Queens, 
graduated as a lawyer and has spent a long career in city and US state 
government.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that her heritage ‘has driven her to excellence’.

Cumberbatch has played several roles which reference his great-grandfather's role as a slave owner, including in Academy Award-nominated 12 Years A Slave

The Sherlock actor's mother apparently asked him not to use his real name during his career for fear of repatriation lawsuits by former slaves

In
 contrast, Cumberbatch was raised in Kensington in London and educated 
at Harrow.

He has complained of being a victim of ‘posh-bashing’ and 
threatened to move to America to escape being ‘castigated as a moaning, 
rich, public-school b******, complaining about only getting posh roles’.

He has insisted that he is middle class and ‘wasn’t born into land or titles, or new money or an oil rig’.

His role in 12 Years a Slave isn’t the first time he has chosen a film that harks back to his family history.

He
 played William Pitt the Younger in the 2006 film Amazing Grace, which 
told the story of William Wilberforce’s fight to eliminate slavery in 
the British empire.

Cumberbatch
 said the role was a ‘sort of apology’ for his ancestor.

Abraham Cumberbatch, an ancestor of Benedict, who lived from 1726 until 1785, owned a sugar plantation in Barbados where he owned slaves. It was common for slaves to take the surnames of their owners

The actor has previously 
revealed that his mother, actress Wanda Veltham, had warned him against 
using the family name professionally because it might prompt descendants
 of the family’s slaves to seek compensation.

Last night Cumberbatch had not responded to the latest revelations.

Fourteen Caribbean countries are suing Britain, France and the Netherlands for billions of pounds in reparations for slavery.
