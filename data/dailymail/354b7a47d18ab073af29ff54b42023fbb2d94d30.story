Judging from the opulence of his tomb, he was a revered Viking warrior destined to take his place in Valhalla among the honoured dead.

Laid to rest in a 17ft boat with his sword, axe and bronze drinking horn, the powerful Norseman’s burial site has been discovered by archaeologists in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands.

The grave, unearthed in Ardnamurchan, is the first of its kind to be found intact on the British mainland and is thought to date from 1,000AD – the height of the ‘Second Viking Age’.

For almost 200 years, from the end of
the eighth century until the reign of Alfred the Great, Danish and 
Norwegian pirates had harassed and looted the British coast at will, and
towards the end of that period moved further inland in a war of 
conquest.

But in the 870s, Alfred – and later  
his descendants – united England against the Viking invaders, driving 
them out of their English strongholds and back to Scandinavia.

They did not return for more than a century, and when they did, peace was shattered.

The Anglo-Saxons, by now ruled by the
hapless Aethelred the Unready,  were once again put to the sword, and 
huge amounts of money and goods were extorted from the native population
in the form of Danegeld – a tax raised by the Vikings.

By 1016, the conquest was completed when Canute became the first Danish king of all England.

It is from this period that the tomb 
dates, and its elaborate contents show how wealthy the Vikings had 
become. Many were converting to Christianity at the time, but from the 
artefacts laid to rest alongside him, it is clear this nobleman had been
firmly committed to the old Norse religion.

The burial site is around 17ft long 
and 5ft wide – the same size as the Viking vessel the warrior was buried
in, which has almost completely rotted away. Only some 200 metal rivets
used to hold the boat together remain, with tiny splinters of wood 
attached.

Buried with him was an axe, a sword 
with a beautifully decorated hilt, a spear, a shield boss, a bronze 
ring-pin and pottery. Other items included a whetstone from Norway for 
sharpening blades and a ring-pin from Ireland, indicating he travelled 
long distances.

The warrior, of whom only two teeth 
and some fragments of bone are left, would have been laid to rest in a 
Pagan ritual. He was placed in the boat with his shield on top of him, 
then the grave was filled to the top with stones.

The bronze drinking horn and weapons 
would have equipped the raider for Valhalla, the giant heavenly hall 
where the bravest Viking warriors believed they would spend eternity.

Dr Hannah Cobb from Manchester 
University, who co-directed the project, said: ‘People have been 
fascinated by these boats for a long  time but it is extremely rare to 
find a burial site intact, so it is of international importance.

‘The artefacts and preservation  also make this one of the most important Norse graves ever excavated  in Britain.’

Viking boat burials were very rare 
because they were reserved for important figures, and many took place in
coastal areas which have eroded away over the years, she added.

Britain's most famous ship burial, Sutton Hoo, is not Viking, but Anglo Saxon, and dates from centuries after the Vikings left the mainland.
