Zlatan Ibrahimovic has hailed Olof Mellberg 'as the greatest Swedish defender of all time' after the former Aston Villa man retired from football.

The 36-year-old made 263 appearances for Villa over seven years and was capped 117 times for his country. 

And Ibrahimovic has paid a glowing tribute to his former international team-mate, who announced his retirement on Thursday.

'The day Olof Mellberg decided to quit the national team it was a great loss to Swedish football and the team,' Ibrahimovic wrote on his official Facebook page.

'But to me personally it was an even greater loss. When I had him on the team I never had to look back because I knew he was behind me and I could concentrate on what was going on up ahead.

'Olof was the person that trigged and challenged me. This drove me to want to do more on the pitch. Olof had a winner mentality like no other. He simply refused to lose, not only in football but in practically everything.

'And when he did lose, which rarely happened, he refused to admit it. I think this mentality was what took him a long way in his career.

'I’ve been doubly lucky when it comes to Olof. Firstly because I got to play with him, and secondly because I got know the person Olof Mellberg, not only the player.

'If Olof in my opinion is the best Swedish defender of all time, I think the person Olof is even better. 

'It is sad that Olof now chooses to end his career because I’m sure he has much more to give. I wish Olof Mellberg and his family all happiness and love in the future. Thank you my friend.'

Mellberg won league titles with AIK Stockholm and Olympiakos and also represented Racing Santander, Juventus, Villarreal and FC Copenhagen during an 18-year career.
