All Draven Rodriguez wanted was a memorable yearbook photo and in the end that's what he got.

While the senior at New York's Schenectady High School originally wanted an image of himself and pet cat Mr. Bigglesworth surrounded by lasers, school officials wouldn't put it in the portrait section.

But now he's he and Mr. Bigglesworth are sharing the the principal's page with administrator Diane Wilkinson, her mixed chihuahua Vivienne, and, yes, a whole lot of lasers.

Draven Rodriguez, 16, started an online petition to support his original picture, but school officials said it couldn't be used on the portrait page

Photographer Vincent Giordano described Vivienne as a nervous model while Mr. Bigglesworth was more interested in the technical aspects.

'Diane and Draven were all laughs, they really enjoyed the photo session,' he told Buzzfeed. 'Vivienne and Mr. Bigglesworth really broke the rules of cats and dogs and got along famously for a trouble free photo session!'

Draven had tried to start a petition to get an image of he and his cat in the yearbook's portrait section.

His campaign soon went viral, prompting support from publications like Gawker, Time, and Cosmopolitan.

The final picture will include an urge for animal rescue and adoption.

“I don’t want to go in the yearbook with the generic ‘I-look-like-everyone-else’ photo. I wanted a ‘He looks great. Only he would try that’ photo,'' Rodriguez told The Daily Gazette. 'When people look at it, they will know that was me.'

School officials said the image of Rodriguez and cat Mr. Bigglesworth did not meet yearbook guidelines for the portrait section

It was reportedly Wilkinson's suggestion to invite him to share her page.

'It was the principal's idea, she went to the student with it, and he loved it,' Corona told The Times-Union.

To be included in the senior portrait section an image must be uniform and 'professional looking.'

'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' Rodriguez said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous

Rodriguez was the first to admit the original image was over the top, which was the point to begin with.

'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' he said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous.

'I'm not trying to make any statement other than my photo is ridiculous and this is how I am.'
