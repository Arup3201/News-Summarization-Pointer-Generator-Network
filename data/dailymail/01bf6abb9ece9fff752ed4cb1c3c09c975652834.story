Welcome to Sao Paulo, where only one thing that stretches further than its sun-soaked beaches of golden sand... traffic jams into the city.

Commuters face a daily nightmare of gridlocks that snake in and out of this metropolis of 11 million people for an average of 112 miles.

Nicknamed locally as 'Cidade da Garoa' (city of drizzle) on account of its unpredictable weather, the city can see jams winding as far as 183 miles on a bad day.

A river of blinking lights: Traffic jams in Sao Paolo can stretch up to 295km on a bad day

Every morning and evening the city's roads transform into blinking rivers of red and white lights as millions of workers edge to work yard by yard.

One of them is mother-of-two Fabiana Crespo, whose journey can take over two hours.

Every day, she travels from her home in the north of the city to work in the south where she recently took over the family business.

And with her 10-month-old baby Rodrigo in the passenger seat, it can be a stressful trip.

'Commuting can make your life Hell,' she told the BBC. 'It is like a sea. A sea of cars.'

Love prevails: Fabiana Crespo met her husband Mauricio in a traffic jam on one drizzly morning nine years ago

But traffic jams have become a way of life for Paulistanos and are interwoven into the fabric of their daily lives.

There is even a radio station that dedicated entirely to updating commuters on the current conditions and advising on routes to speed their journeys up 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

'We have become slaves of traffic and we have to plan our lives around it.'

'It's like a war': Victoria Ribeiro, whose job is to drive around town finding traffic jams, says everybody seems to become 'very selfish' once they are behind the wheel of a car

But despite the fraying tempers and tooting horns, love can still prevail, she insists.

It was in one such rush-hour jam that Mrs Crespo met her husband Mauricio on one drizzly morning nine years ago.

'It was one of those busy days of bust traffic, and I started exchanging glances with a certain somebody... and it worked out.

After some flirting through the windows Mauricio persuaded her to give him her phone number and later that day he called.

'I think this is the only thing we can't complain about in Sao Paulo's traffic,' she added.

In a city of 11 million people, cars have become a symbol of the middle class for upwardly mobile Paulistanos and an opportunity of avoid the city's unreliable public transport system.

It is largely thanks to Brazil's economic boom the country has seen an explosion in car ownership.

Sul America Traffic Radio has 
become one of the city's most popular radio stations after launching a year ago to constantly update motorists while also offering a portal for them to vent their frustrations.

During rush hour, the station sends a helicopter
into the air while a team of reporters take to the roads attempting to find the least congested routes through the city.

But their map-like knowledge of Sao Paolo's streets, they often get stuck themselves.

'It's like a war, because everybody seems to become very selfish once they are behind the wheel of a car,' Victoria Ribeiro, whose job is to drive around 
town finding traffic jams, told the BBC.
