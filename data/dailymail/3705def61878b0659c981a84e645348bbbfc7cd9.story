Fascinated: Liam McAtear, 16,wrote a 'chilling' letter to Moors murderer Ian Brady before sneaking into another boy's bedroom and beating him with a claw hammer

A teenager wrote a 'chilling' letter to Moors murderer Ian Brady detailing his fascination with the infamous killer before sneaking into another boy's bedroom and beating him with a claw hammer.

Liam McAtear, 16, was given a life sentence for the protection of the public after he crept into the other boy's bedroom and hit him repeatedly with the metal hammer.

A court heard how McAtear had written to child killer Brady, expressing his 'fascination' with the infamous murderer who killed five children alongside Myra Hindley in the 1960s.

He also wrote notes, found in his bedroom, in which he expressed his desire to murder the teenager, who was also 16.

One read: 'I am planning a murder and it is very interesting and makes me feel good.

'The person I am going to kill is a low life, a good for nothing, so what do people care what becomes of him?

'I certainly do not and I will go to any lengths to end his life.'

A
 second note detailed how McAtear, from Clayton-le-Moors, would wait 
until the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was in bed 
before he launched his attack.

At
 a hearing at Preston Crown Court on Friday, Judge Anthony Russell QC 
sentenced McAtear to life imprisonment for the 'protection of the 
public' after he had admitted attempted murder.

He
 will not be eligible for parole for at least six years and 134 days. 
Even if it is considered that he can be released, he will be on license 
for the rest of his life.

The
 court was told that an allegation had been made by a mutual friend of 
the defendant and the victim, who can not be named for legal reasons, 
that McAtear had touched her inappropriately.

McAtear was worried about how people would see him in light of the accusations, the judge heard.

During
 the early hours of September 16 last year, the defendant went to the 
victim's bedroom and began hitting him over the head with the weapon.

The blows continued and the teenager put his arm up to protect himself.

Jeremy
 Gront-Smith, prosecuting, said the victim shouted out 'right that is 
enough' and began crying before suffering one further blow.

He
 was taken to hospital for treatment for a depressed fracture to his 
skull. In total, he suffered 12 individual injuries to his head.

Mr Gront-Smith said the youngster still suffered from numbness around his skull.

In
 a victim impact statement read to the court by Mr Gront-Smith, the 
victim said: 'I was a lot more active prior to the attack, a lot more 
sociable.

'This has changed since. I have changed from a bubbly, outgoing person and I lack the get up and go I had previously.'

Defending, Mark Stuart said his client, who had passed eight GCSEs, was very intelligent and had planned to take four science A Levels with the hope of studying medicine.

Sentence: Sitting at Preston crown Court Judge Anthony Russell QC sentenced McAtear to life imprisonment for the 'protection of the public' after he admitted attempted murder

He said: 'This was undoubtedly a wicked attack. To say anything otherwise would be to belittle what happened.

'The only feature of mitigation is that the defendant was prepared to plead guilty.

'A culmination of features probably led to the defendant behaving in the way that he did.'

Judge Russell said McAtear's intelligence made him 'more dangerous', but that the boy had severe personality problems.

He said: 'You are a high risk of developing mental illness.

'What is of particular concern is that you express no remorse for what you have done.

'You are very much more articulate than many who appear in these courts. In the circumstance of this case, that makes you more dangerous.

'In my judgement, a chilling feature of your case is you composed a letter to Ian Brady expressing your fascination in him.'

Speaking after the hearing, Det Insp Mark Vaughton, of Blackburn CID, said: 'The sentence reflects the severity of the ordeal that the victim had to endure.

'This attack was vicious, unprovoked and sustained, leaving the victim seriously injured.

'Whilst he has made a good recovery from his physical injuries he still suffers from mental scars.

'I hope the sentence can bring the victim some closure so that he can start to move on with his life.'
