A widow whose husband's death in 2012 was wrongly deemed a suicide has spoken out about her battle to have the decision overturned.

Investigations by the Buncombe County police and the area medical examiner concluded that the death of Clay Santimore, Shannon Santimore's husband, was an accident.

However, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled that the death was a suicide and dismissed Shannon Santimore's requests to overturn the decision.

Moving forward: Shannon Santimore with her son, Matt, and twin daughters, Kate, left, and Ellie. Santimore's husband, Clay, died in a firearm accident in North Carolina that was wrongly ruled a suicide by the state medical examiners office

According to the Charlotte Observer, Clay Santimore traveled from the family's home in Massachusetts to Asheville, North Carolina on January 13, 2012, to visit an old friend, Kevin Gorman.

Accidental: Shannon Santimore says her husband was in one of the happiest periods of his life and devoted to their three children before he died

As he and Gorman caught up, Scott Cole, a friend of Gorman's, arrived with two handguns. Gorman was considering purchasing a firearm and Cole was helping to advise him on what type would be appropriate.

According to court records, Cole removed the magazine from a Glock handgun and dry-fired it before putting the magazine back in and placing it on a counter.

According to Cole, Santimore then picked up the weapon and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

Cole says he then removed it from his mouth and pulled the slide back before replacing it in his mouth.

What happened next, a judge eventually ruled, was not suicide but 'consistent with [Santimore's] personality as a prankster.'

Santimore put the now-armed gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

Homicide detectives concluded that the death an accident, and that alcohol and Clay Santimore's 'unfamiliarity with firearms' and alcohol played a part, reports the Charlotte Observer.

A local medical examiner, Dr Sharon Sweede, came to the same conclusion.

However, Dr Jonathan Privette, an associate chief medical examiner, concluded that Clayton Santimore's death was a suicide and he and Dr Deborah Radische, the state's chief medical examiner, refused Shannon Santimore's pleas to examine the case more closely.

She was not content to let sleeping dogs lie.

At stake was $1.2 million in insurance payments, money she desperately needed to raise her children, and more importantly, her children's knowledge that their father did not intend to kill himself.

Prankster: A judge ruled that Clay Santimore couldn't have known the gun was loaded when he put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger

Devoted: Shannon Santimore wanted her children to know that their father never intended to leave them

'I needed 
to find the answers for my children and be able to tell them without any
 doubt that their dad did not leave them on purpose,' Shannon Santimore 
told the Charlotte Observer.

After a three-day hearing, a judge ruled that Clayton Santimore's death was accidental.

He
 found that not only did Privette come to his conclusion without taking 
into account the conclusinos of the sheriff's office or the local 
medical examiner.

He
 also relied on an incorrect definition of suicide, which doesn't take 
into account whether or not the victim intended to kill themselves or 
not.

Tragic loss: Shannon and Clayton were parents to a young son and two baby twin girls when he died in the horrific accident

The judge criticized Privette because he 'failed to investigate and scrutinize all the evidence available,' which brought him to the wrong conclusion.

Shannon Santimore had been awarded $300,000 in insurance following her husband's death. She was unaware that when the death was ruled an accident, she was entitled to a much larger sum.

Now, she says, she can stay at home with her twin little girls until they start school as she and Clayton had planned.

The Charlotte Observer contacted Privette for comment, but he refused to be interviewed, saying only, 'Based on my investigation, and even considering the subsequent administrative hearing, my opinion about the manner of death remains unchanged.'
