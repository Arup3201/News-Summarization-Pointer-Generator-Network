Most of us get stung by an insect occasionally and grumble about it for a couple of minutes before forgetting about it.

Not so for one researcher from Arizona.

Justin Schmidt, from the Southwestern 
Biological Institute, has been stung so many times that he decided to 
create a pain scale to rate the insects’ stings.

Justin Schmidt has been stung so many times he decided to create a pain scale to rate insects' stings. He says that the most painful is a bullet ant (pictured) which he says 'makes you want to lay down and die'

Mr Schmidt’s scale ranges from zero to four, with a one being a minor reaction, and four being the worst pain you can imagine.

Mr Schmidt explained to Weather.com what a one on the scale would be.

Fire Ant - one (pain lasts two to four minutes)

Honeybee - two (pain lasts up to ten minutes)

Bumblebee - two (pain for up to five minutes)

German Yellowjacket - two (pain lasts four to ten minutes)

Velvet Ant - three (pain for up to 30 minutes)

Harvester Ant - three (pain for one to eight hours)

Paper Wasp - three (pain for five to 15 minutes)

Warrior Wasp - four (pain for up to two hours)

Tarantula Hawk - four (pain for three minutes)

Bullet Ant - four (pain for 12 to 24 hours)

He said it would cause a sharp pain but would not be enough to make you drop your drink.

However, he goes on to explain how he
 would describe a four – this would be a creature such as a tarantula 
hawk, which he says feels like being hit by 20,000 volts.

Not only would it make you drop your drink, it would make you throw it across the room, he says.

He told Weather.com that a bullet ant has the most painful sting he has encountered.

He said: 'They just make you want to lay down and die. You are just screaming in pain and agony.'

In contrast, he said that the sting of a fire ant is much less painful.

He said: 'They have this kind of sharp, piercing sting.

'Your immediate reaction is "brush those things off". That's all its going to do to you.'

Mr Schmidt ranks the bug's stings from zero to four with four being the worst pain imaginable. He rated the sting of the tarantula hawk (pictured) a four

Mr Schmidt believes he has been stung by 150 different bugs. He rates the sting of the fire ant (pictured) a one and says the pain lasts between two and four minutes

According to Mr Schmidt’s scale, a fire ant has one of the least painful stings – a one on his scale – honeybees and bumblebees’ stings score a two, and the stings of warrior wasps, bullet ants, and tarantula hawks score four.

He claims to have been stung by about 150 different insects while travelling the world but says it doesn't worry him, as none of the insects’ bites have a lasting impact.

Mr Schmidt says that the pain from a honeybee (pictured) sting ranks at two on his scale and lasts for up to ten minutes

Stings that rate zero cause no pain, those that rate four are the worst
