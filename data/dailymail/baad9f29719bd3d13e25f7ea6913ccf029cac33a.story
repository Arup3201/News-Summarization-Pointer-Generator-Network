It appears Prime Minister David Cameron, US President Barack Obama and a few other political heavyweights will have to look elsewhere for discounted booze or oversized chocolate bars if they ever find themselves in the Russian city of Vladivostok.

They have been banned from shopping at a duty free shop at Vladivostok International Airport in a bizarre move that hits back at EU and US sanctions against Russia amid the deadly conflict in Ukraine.

Writer and editor Michael Idov photographed a backlit sign, which announces the decision to ban 13 world leaders or Ukrainian officials, when he flew out of the airport over the weekend.

No-buy list: A duty free shop at Vladivostok Airport has banned world leaders and Ukrainian officials

The sign says: ‘In line with the decision of Duty Free shop Administration these persons are not welcome here and will not be attended to a customer in this shop'.

In addition to the UK prime minister and US president, the duty free shop has also said ‘nyet’ to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 

Six Ukrainian officials, including President Petro Poroshenko and Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, are also on the no-buy list as the shop exacts its revenge for the sanctions.

Mr Idov told i100 that the duty free shop’s sign reminded him of homemade printouts, declaring ‘Entry denied to Barack Obama’, that have been posted on random walls in recent weeks.

He said: ‘What took me aback in this case was both the placement - the international lounge of an international airport, in a city that has just hosted a great international music festival - and the sleekness of the design.

‘I can’t imagine this sign being installed without the approval of the airport authorities. It truly boggles the mind.’

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, the airport said it did not put up the sign and it has no plans to remove it because it is a matter of free speech.

The airport said: ‘The announcement about sales limitations to certain persons within the duty free shop area is from the duty free shop administration.

‘However, according to national current legislation regulations Vladivostok International Airport, JSC does not consider it necessary to prevent anyone from expressing his/her views or opinions.’

Vladivostok is a port city on the Sea of Japan in Russia’s far east, near the country’s borders with China and North Korea. It hosted the Vladivostok Rocks music festival over the weekend.
