Former Fulham manager Felix Magath has bought a one per cent stake in Rangers and wants to have a key role in the future of the ailing Ibrox club.

Magath, who was sacked by the Championship outfit in September, purchased the shares late last year, and it is understood he has held discussions with one of the groups vying for control of the club.

The 61-year-old has no interest in returning to the dugout but rather sees a role for himself as technical director at the club's Murray Park training complex where he can oversee the work with future Rangers talent.

On Friday, Magath refused to answer questions when asked about his stake in the club.

He said: 'I don't want to comment on my stock dealings, that's private.

'I spent the Christmas holidays in London and actually visited someone in Glasgow but I don't want to comment on whether there has been talks with the club either.'

Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall also refused to comment on suggestions that Magath may soon be reporting for duty.

'I don't think that will be my decision on whether he comes in or not,' he said. 'I've got a job to do and I'm just carrying on with it.'

Despite his poor spell at Fulham, Magath remains widely admired in Germany for his work at several clubs, having won the Bundesliga title twice while in charge of Bayern Munich and once as boss of Wolfsburg.
