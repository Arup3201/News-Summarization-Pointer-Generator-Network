Columbine High School - the scene of the 1999 school massacre that left 13 people dead – was placed on a high security alert today over threatening phone calls.

The Littleton, Colorado, school received the first threat at 10am and others came ‘over the next 2-3 minutes,’ said Jacki Kelley, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

The school was placed on lockout, which prevents people from entering or leaving but allows them to freely circulate inside.

The alert also applied to a half-dozen other schools in the area and was issued shortly before noon.

Kelley said the department has sent ‘additional resources’ to protect the school and is investigating the threats.

Besides Columbine, the lockout affected Blue Heron, Columbine Hills, Dutch Creek, Governor’s Ranch, Leawood and Normandy elementary schools, and Ken Caryl Middle School.

Shortly after 2pm, officials announced that the lockout has been lifted.

‘All students and staff are safe,’ the school district posted on its Twitter feed.

Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman Mark Techmeyer noted that threats made to Columbine were not uncommon.

In April 1999, two heavily armed students opened fire at Columbine, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others before committing suicide in the school’s library.
