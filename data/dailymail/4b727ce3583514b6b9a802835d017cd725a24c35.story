Maid Chadmila Lopez stole $150,000 of jewellery from former Louis Vuitton executive Bettye Musham (pictured)

A maid who stole $150,000 worth of diamond rings from a retired Louis Vuitton boss will be deported from the US once she's served her three-year prison sentence.

Chadmila Lopez pleaded guilty to taking the haul of jewellery from Bettye Musham's Upper East Side flat whilst she worked for the former designer brand executive.

The gems included two Cartier diamond rings, a Cartier sapphire ring and an Enamel diamond gypsy ring taken from a jewellery drawer in 80-year-old Ms Musham’s home last October.

The precious items were never recovered.

Lopez, 28, who also stole from one of Musham’s house guests, was sentenced to up to three years in prison but was told she could be released in just one.

After she serves her time she will deported back to her native Guinea Bissau in west Africa, the court heard.

'My understanding is that immigration has already been contacted and she’ll be deported,' said Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Bonnie Wittner.

During yesterday's hearing Lopez showed no remorse and refused to apologise to her boss.

Prosecutors read a statement from Ms Musham, 80, who described Lopez’s actions as 'outrageous'.

She said: 'You stole from me seven rings which you had to search for. They were in my jewellery drawer. Later you stole from my house guest.

'You betrayed me. You betrayed your family. You betrayed yourself. Why?'

The court heard how Ms Musham has helped Lopez get into Marymount Manhattan College but she dropped out.

She then helped the thief become an administrative assistant at a company willing to sponsor her for a green card so she could stay in the country.
