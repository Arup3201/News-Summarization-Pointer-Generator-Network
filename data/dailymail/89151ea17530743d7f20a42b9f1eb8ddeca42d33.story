A conductor forced his passengers to get off the train so he could go to hospital after being bitten by a 12-inch Daxiedoodle puppy.

The rail worker was walking through the train when he reached out to stroke the dog - a Dachshund/Poodle cross - sitting on its owner's lap.

But it snapped back and chaos ensued.

Stranded: Passengers were forced to get off at Fishbourne, West Sussex, as the conductor went to hospital

The man rushed to the tannoy of Sunday's 2.17pm Southern Rail service from London Victoria to Portsmouth Harbour, announcing: 'I’m very sorry but I am going have to terminate the train here.

'I have been bitten by a dog on the train and I am bleeding quite profusely.

'I am going to need urgent medical attention.'

Menacing? The 12-inch-tall Daxiedoodle bit the conductor when he reached out to stroke it

Cross: Daxiedoodles have the personality and protectiveness of Dachshunds; the intelligence of Poodles

A cross between a Dachshund and a Poodle, Daxiepoodles are notoriously difficult to house-train.

An owner must portray themselves as a leader of a pack to have any sway over their companion.

Young Daxiedoodles - also referred to as Doxiepoos and Doodles - can be as small as six inches tall so they are rarely painted as menacing dogs. But they are incredibly hyperactive. 

From poodles, they inherit intelligence and minimum moulting.

Their dachshund heritage gives them powerful personalities and protectiveness.

Under 20 minutes from the final 
destination, the service made an unscheduled stop at Fishbourne, West 
Sussex, and everyone aboard was ushered off.

The
bemused customers were then left standing on a platform in the rain as 
the man clutched tissues to his injured hand and waited for an ambulance
to arrive.

Eventually, a paramedic rushed on to the platform and took the conductor to hospital.

Lorna Rowsewell, 25, from Portsmouth, said: 'I was heading back from London and this made me about an hour late home.

'The whole thing just seemed really ridiculous.

'It was a fluffy little grey dog that was with its owners and their children.

'It didn’t look like it could seriously hurt someone, even if it tried.

'No-one could understand why the conductor and his colleague couldn’t have just soldiered on for the remaining 20 minute journey.

'Thankfully we weren’t held up too long, but it did seem like a waste of resources to call an ambulance for a tiny dog bite.'

A driver moved the train along the track and passengers joined a delayed Southern Rail service to Portsmouth Harbour at 4.40pm.

Southern Rail spokesman Chris Hudson said: 'The conductor was taken to hospital.

'Because the presence of a conductor on that service is required, the train had to be cancelled from that point.'
