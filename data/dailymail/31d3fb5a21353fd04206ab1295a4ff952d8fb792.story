Tragic: Justin Chey, who has held his family together, has been diagnosed with a brain tumor

A 12-year-old boy who has helped keep his hard-up immigrant family afloat while caring for his sick grandparents has tragically been diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor - after keeping quiet about the symptoms for months.

Justin Chey, from Des Moines, Iowa, manages to work small jobs between attending school, cooking meals, preparing insulin injections for his diabetic grandfather and looking after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer's - all while his mother, who is originally from Cambodia, works night shifts as a school custodian.

But on October 10, after suffering severe headaches, Justin collapsed in class at Hiatt Middle School and tests revealed he has a cancerous tumor, a medulloblastoma, inside his brain.

After the tumor began affecting his 
facial muscles and vision, he underwent emergency surgery. He will begin
 chemotherapy in two weeks but doctors said they do not yet know his 
prognosis.

They have yet to determine whether the tumor, which is situated in the lower part of his brain, has spread to his spine, the Des Moines Register reported.

Throughout the past few months, Justin never let on the extent of his painful headaches and insisted he needed to go to school.

Devoted: His mother, Kelly Chey, who is originally from Cambodia, works the night shift as a custodian and Justin has taken on cooking and caring for his grandparents, while also picking up odd jobs

Proud: Kelly, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s, said she is proud of her son's hard work and modesty

And
the surgery on October 15, his family was stunned by the 
outpouring of support from his schoolmates - who have said Justin is the
 kindest kid they know.

'Justin is one kid who is liked by 
everybody,' his teacher Kim Bata told the Register. 'He's a sensitive, caring kid. 
All the kids agree: He's never said a mean thing about anyone else.'

His mother Kelly Chey, who came to the U.S. with her family in 1984, has a full-time job with the school district but has struggled after splitting with her husband eight years ago.

Justin's father stays in touch with him but lives out of state and cannot afford to travel to Iowa.

Kelly said affording to live been possible with the help of her son, who has volunteered for odd jobs in his neighborhood to help with the income.

Until his disease took over, Justin slept on the family's living room floor but now has been moved to the largest room.

His
 friends and teachers have visited him there, asking him what he wants 
for his birthday on October 31, when he will turn 13 - but he says he 
wants nothing.

Concerns: 12-year-old Justin collapsed while in class at Hiatt Middle School, pictured, two weeks ago

Diagnosis: He was found to have a brain tumor and underwent surgery at the Mercy Medical Center

He smiled as his teacher added: 'Don't worry buddy. We're 
getting meals, we're getting money for your mom... you donâ€™t need to 
worry about anything.'

Other classmates have made him get well cards or brought over home-cooked food for his family. School officials are also collecting money, aware that Chey will have to take time off work for Justin.

'I've told him: I'm here for you,' Chey said. 'Now, everyone is here to support you.'

How can you help Justin? Students and staff at Hiatt Middle School are collecting meals, birthday presents, party favors and money for Justin and his family.

Donations can be delivered to the school, 1430 E. University Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa or for more information, contact hiatt@dmschools.org or 242-7774.
