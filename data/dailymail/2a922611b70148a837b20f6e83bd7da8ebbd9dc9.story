Their debut YouTube video of them miming to Queen's hit song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' attracted 18 million hits,  caught the attention of Brian May, and was credited by Billboard magazine with causing a staggering 261 per cent surge in the streaming of the iconic song.

And now Sydney-based trio SketchSHE are back with a second hilarious car jam  titled 'Mime Through Time' featuring over 14 classic songs from the 40s through to now...and this time they appear naked.

The stunning models turned comedy act, comprised of Shae-Lee Shackleford,28, Lana Kington, 25, Madison Lloyd,27, became an  overnight sensation when they released  'Bohemian Carsody' last month.

One third of the trio, Shae-Lee Shackleford, says the response has been more than they ever imagined for the act that only started filming skits in December.

'We had no idea it would have such an incredible response. The fact that we've had people writing to us from around the world... I don't think there's been a country or continent that hasn't reached out and written to us to say they loved it.'

Shackleford, 28, says the reason she thinks they've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable, people love the song, it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a 'rock out' to it.

Another reason behind the Sydney trio's success is the natural sex appeal they inject into the humorous skit. 

As models who met  through the same agency, Shackleford admits while they are aware of their attractiveness they've chosen to incorporate it into the act in a way that defies the typical 'pretty girl' stereotype and still empowers women.

 'Unlike what might be synonymous with an attractive girl, we want to be crazy, let our hair down, and break the rules a bit. But we still like to wear make-up and dress up - we just want be able to make fun of what we do while empowering women to be comfortable in their own skin.'

In their latest hit 'Mime Through Time', you can definitely expect even more sex appeal with the final scene including a rip-off of Miley Cyrus's 'Wrecking Ball' in which the girls go completely topless in their now famous Suzuki Swift. 

Shackleford admits the scene (which was filmed in the car of her dad's back drive way) was a definite risk and two alternative ends were filmed in case it came across as too risqué.

'When I first told mum she said "oooh, I don't know" but then when they saw it they cracked up and  think it's a great joke... My mum was more shocked by the fact I looked so much like my brother in the slim shady scene... which I'm not sure is a good thing.' 

The girls only use the bare essentials to produce the clip. 'The first time we had a bra in the car so we taped the iPhone to it and propped it up that way, but this time we upgraded to a block of wood, but it's still very dodgy,' says Shackleford.

As for the car setting itself, while the girls plan to continue jamming it out in the Suzuki, they admit there are restrictions.  

'The very first take we did of the Elvis song, there's a bit where we do a canon with our face down and I completely head-butted the steering wheel. Lana just cracked up laughing and didn't ask if I'm okay, guess that sums up our friendship completely,' says Shackleford.

 When asked what the girls hope the audience will take away from their latest clip, Shackleford says as long as they laugh out loud at some point she'll be happy. But a good reminisce is also great too.

Next up for the girls after the release of new clip 'Mime in Time' that's out today is a trip to Los Angeles for two weeks to line up a series of interviews in which they hope lands them a partner with a hope to start their own comedy show. We also hear new modes of transport will be included in part two of the SketchSHE skits and there may even be a blooper reel on it's way... Stay tuned.
