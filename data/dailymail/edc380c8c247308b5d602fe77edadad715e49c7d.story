A hospital worker has shed three stone in just three months in a bid to look like her favourite soap star, Jennifer Ellison.

Jade Gibbs, 25, who had always struggled with her weight, was inspired towards a svelte figure after seeing Jennifer Ellison's success in fighting her flab.

Gibbs, from Brighton, said she was a self-confessed Diet Coke fan and would guzzle three litres of the drink a day - as well as eating junk food - and ballooned to a size 16.

Jade Gibbs was inspired to lose a hefty three stone after seeing her favourite soap star's success

Her weight soared to 12 stone 6lbs, which was overweight for her 5ft 1in frame.

Jade said: 'I’ve
 always thought Jennifer Ellison was gorgeous and when she lost weight I
 thought I could only ever dream of looking like that.' 

After seeing the Brookside star's weight loss success using the Cambridge Weight Plan, Jade was determined to make it work.  

'I was inspired by Jennifer Ellison. I thought if she has managed to lose all that weight, I can too.'

Jade's weight struggle began when she was working night shifts at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.

She would scoff on convenient yet calorific sandwiches, crisps and chocolate and would even tuck into food brought in as a thank you by patients' families.

Before her dramatic weight loss Jade, pictured with fiance Tom, weighed more than 12 stone

Jade always admired the way Jennifer Ellison (right) looked and hoped she could look as good as the actress

Rather than face up to her unhealthy habits, Jade, then a size 16, lived in denial and avoided the subject completely.

'Deep down I knew I was putting on weight but I couldn’t bear the thought of it so I banned the scales and didn’t weigh myself,' she said.

'As my clothes got tighter I went into denial. I used every excuse possible to justify my weight gain, from the shop sizing being wrong, to saying I was a size 12 - even though deep down I knew I was nearer a 16.

'The more I told people the more I believed it.'

In denial: Jade said she would squeeze into smaller dress sizes rather than admit she was a size 16

Jade noticed her weight gain once her clothes began to get tighter and she began to wear baggier outfits

Jade became more and more self concious about her weight and began to worry about what other people may think.

'I wasn’t confident at all and I used to be paranoid that people were staring at me and saying things about my weight in the street.

'I used to hide myself under unflatterly black and baggy clothes which is not what a young woman in her 20s wants to be wearing.'

Jade did attempt to lose weight but admits that she was a yo-yo dieter and would start a crash diet before getting bored and bingeing on her favourite food.

'It was a vicious cycle and I was always using the classic excuse "the diet starting on Monday".'

But it was Jennifer Ellison who finally motivated Jade to lose a three stone in just three months.

Before she lost weight: Jennifer Ellison followed the Cambridge plan help her drop to a size 10

'I had no idea how I was going to try and lose the weight until I came across some pictures of Jennifer Ellison.

'I followed her on Twitter and think she is gorgeous. I saw she posted lots of pictures about her weight loss and it really inspired me.'

Instead of her regular diet of high fat and salty foods, Jade took after Jennifer and gave the Cambridge Weight Plan a go.

She swapped crisps, sandwiches and chocolate for three soups, shakes, and porridge meals a day as well as swapping her beloved diet coke for three litres of water.

Jade is now a slender 9 stone 5lb, having dropped three dress sizes and now fitting comfortably into a size 10, which matches Ellison's size.

Since reaching her goal weight Jade and fiance Tom (pictured) have started planning their wedding in Mexico

'I cannot 
express what an amazing journey Cambridge has been,' says Jade, 'since the age of 15 
I've never been below 10st 5lbs so to be in the 9 stone bracket is a 
dream come true.

'I am delighted to be a size 10 in my favourite stores and I finally feel confident and comfortable in myself.'

For Jade her weight loss has been life changing and has even encouraged her to finally make plans to get married.

'I am so much happier now. I have been planning my wedding with my fiance.'

Jade who is engaged to 26-year-old Tom Lawson, will get married in Mexico in September.

'Tom has been so supportive and is so pleased that I am happier with my weight.

'I didn’t want to be a fat bride and now I don’t have to be.I can now look forward to feeling and hopefully looking amazing in my dream wedding dress.

'I
 can’t wait to wear a bikini on the beach and feel body confident for 
the first time in my life, without covering up with the usual sarong or 
kaftan.'
