White House Press Secretary Jay Carney endured a sustained grilling from reporters on Wednesday as he struggled to explain an email showing the White House's involvement in spinning a false account of why four Americans died in Benghazi, Libya less than two months before the 2012 presidential election.

The email, written by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, described a 'prep call' with then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice which took place four days after the September 11, 2012 terror attack, and less than a day before she was to be a guest on five different Sunday morning political talk shows.

During the initial weeks after the attack, the White House and congressional Democrats told the public that Muslim protesters, upset over a crude American-produced YouTube video mocking Islam, demonstrated outside U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi before channeling their anger toward arson and artillery.

Rhodes informed the West Wing communications team – including Carney – that one 'goal' of the Sept. 15, 2012 call would be to prepare Rice 'to ​underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.'

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney put on a defensive sparring clinic Wednesday, trying in vain to protect the Obama administration from revelations contained in a newly released internal email dating from the first days after the Benghazi terror attack

Palace intrigue: Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes (R) set up a pre-TV-show 'prep call' for then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice (L), outlining a communications strategy that now suggests the White House purposely misled the nation into thinking a crude YouTube video incited the deadly Benghazi terror attack

Scene of the crime: U.S. consular facilities inside the Benghazi compound were torched the night of September 11, 2012, and four U.S. personnel including Ambassador Chris Stevens lost their lives

Carney insisted Wednesday during a White House press briefing that Rhodes' email 'was explicitly not about Benghazi. It was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world, where you saw protests outside of embassy facilities across the region, including in Cairo, Sana’a, Khartoum and Tunis.'

But Wednesday night the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent MailOnline a cover letter showing that on April 17, the U.S. Department of State provided committee staff with copies of a batch of documents in response to a subpoena for Benghazi-related materials.

The Rhodes email was among them, although committee staff told MailOnline that most of it was redacted, or blacked-out.

'As part of the Department’s ongoing document production we are providing an additional set of documents in connection with the Committee’s investigation into the attacks on the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi,' State Department Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield wrote.

'This production consists of documents responsive to the Committee’s subpoena of August 1, 2013.'

The Rhodes email, declared 'classified' by the White House prior to the release of related materials in May 2013, would likely have remained out of public view but for a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit filed against the State Department by Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group.

Its later pages also specifically refer to Benghazi.

Rhodes wrote that Rice needed to be prepared to answer the question: 'What's your response to the Independent story that says we have intelligence 48 hours in advance of the Benghazi attack that was ignored?'

A scripted answer provided for the 'prep call' read: 'We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent. The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.'

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told former CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson that the White House seems to have tried to keep the Rhodes email out of public view by declaring it 'classified' out of convenience.

'They retroactively changed the classification,' Chaffetz said. 'That was an unclassified document and they changed it to classified.'

Judicial Watch communications director mocked the White House press secretary on Wednesday evening for downplaying the significance of the documents her group surfaced.

'The Benghazi documents we released were produced by a LAWSUIT,' she emphasized in a statement to MailOnline. 'That Carney would imply that the State Department gave us some random document doesn't pass the giggle test.'  

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens perished in the terror attack, which included militants from the al-Qaeda-linked group Ansar al-Shariah

Rhodes, who often briefs reporters on conference calls and it typically referred to vaguely as a 'senior White House official,' wrote an email days after the Benghazi attack that Republicans now see as a smoking gun

'Now we know the Obama White House's chief concern about the Benghazi attack was making sure that President Obama looked good,' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said Wednesday.

'And these documents undermine the Obama administration’s narrative that it thought the Benghazi attack had something to do with protests or an Internet video. Given the explosive material in these documents, it is no surprise that we had to go to federal court to pry them loose from the Obama State Department.'

Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus mocked the Obama administration for what now appears a ham-fisted attempt to keep sensational details about its response to a deadly terror attack out of public view.

'If the White House felt this talking points memo was classified, what else don't we know about Benghazi and is all of this stonewalling just to protect Hillary?' he jabbed.

President Obama stood for re-election eight weeks to the day after the Benghazi attack, and ultimately shifted gears to emphasize that the attack was premeditated, highly organized, ruthless and coordinated by al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militants.

The question of who inserted the video, titled 'Innocence of Muslims,' into his administration's official narrative about the murderous chaos that ensued has been a political football since Rice told those five TV audiences that it was the lit match that set off a deadly powder keg.

'Based on the best information we have to date,' she told CBS's 'Face the Nation' in one example, 'what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy – sparked by this hateful video.'

History, Obama-style: To this day news bureaus encounter captions on photos like this one, showing the Benghazi diplomatic station in mid-conflagration, referring to the event as the outgrowth of a protest that never happened

Not true: Susan Rice told CBS viewers five days after the terror attack that 'our assessment is' that the Benghazi attack 'began spontaneously' after a 'violent protest [was] sparked by this hateful video' elsewhere in the Muslim world

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday that the emails Judicial Watch released 'show that Benghazi, in the eyes of the White House, was a political problem for re-election and they approached it from that point of view.'

The email setting Rice's talk-show agenda, he added, 'clearly shows that Ben Rhodes was trying to be a political operative rather than a national security spokesman.'

On TV that Sunday, Rice was working from a series of talking points that Democrats in Congress had requested for their own use in media interviews. That document's initial draft, prepared by the CIA, declared that 'we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaeda participated in the attack.'

By the time the talking points filtered down to Rice, however, that notice was gone – along with other declarations about terror threats in Benghazi during the previous months, including some from an al-Qaeda-affiliated group called Ansar al-Shariah.

Many of those edits, it emerged later, were made at the State Department, with then-spokeswoman Victoria Nuland objecting just days after the attacks in an email that the administration shouldn't name specific terror groups because 'we don't want to prejudice the investigation.'

Carney assured reporters in November 2012 that 'the White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word "consulate" to "diplomatic facility" because "consulate" was inaccurate.'

Sen. Graham told Attkisson that 'the political shop at the White House took over early on. They understood it was a terrorist attack, that they had a political problem, and were going to handle it politically.'

'They weren't going to entertain anything other than what they wanted the public to hear.'

Graham co-signed a letter Monday with fellow Republicans Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and John McCain of Arizona, asking the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees to force Obama administration figures to explain whether State Department or White House personnel were involved in briefing Rice.

They referred former deputy CIA director Michael Morell, who testified this year that Rice linked the YouTube video to the attacks despite the CIA never making that connection in its analysis.

'How could former Ambassador to the United
 Nations Susan Rice, during the five Sunday talk shows on September 16, 
2012, claim that the attacks on our compounds were caused by a hateful 
video,' the senators wrote, 'when Mr. Morell testified that the CIA never mentioned the video as
 a causal factor?'
