Fred Nile has stirred up controversy by saying that male hostages who fled the tragic Sydney siege shouldn't receive bravery awards.

The Christian Democrat politician, who is a long-standing member of the NSW uppper house, believes that only Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, who were both killed along with gunman Man Haron Monis in the 16-hour siege, should be given separate awards. But none should be handed out for bravery.

However, all the men who escaped from the Lindt Cafe don’t deserve to receive any.

New South Wales MP Fred Nile believed that male hostages who fled the Sydney siege should not receive bravery awards

‘They should get recognition for what they suffered as hostages but I don't think they should get bravery awards,’ Mr Nile told Fairfax Radio.

‘Maybe they could have done something more to protect the women.

‘Normally bravery awards are given for an act of bravery - that somebody actually does something. They haven't done anything.’

Mr Nile also argued that it would only lessen the worth of the bravery awards to those male hostages who fled.

Earlier this week Prime Minister Tony Abbott requested that Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove support a push to honour the victims, surviving hostages and emergency services with bravery awards.

Mr Nile said the male hostages that fled the from siege did not deserve bravery awards
