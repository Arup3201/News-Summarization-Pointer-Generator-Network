Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal must have feared his injury curse had struck again at Old Trafford after record signing Angel di Maria was asked to play on by Argentina having been stamped on the foot by Nani.

Di Maria crumpled to the ground in agony after Nani, still a Manchester United player but on loan to Sporting Lisbon, caught him with a reckless challenge after 18 minutes.

With Van Gaal watching anxiously from the stands, Argentina surprisingly asked Di Maria to continue after he had finally got to his feet after being stricken for a couple of minutes.

It was only after an hour that Di Maria was finally replaced by Carlos Tevez even though Argentina manager Gerardo Martino afterwards admitted he had received a 'tough blow'.

Martino said: 'It cut the skin a little bit, it was a tough knock.

'We have had a look at it though and we don't think it is anything serious. We took an X-ray and looked at the images and we are evaluating it. But in spite of that, we do not think it is serious.' 

Di Maria added: 'It was just a blow. I hope it doesn't swell any more so I can play at the weekend.'

Portugal beat Argentina 1-0 in the international friendly  with Raphael Guerreiro heading the winner in injury-time.

The much-hyped showdown between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo failed to burst into life with both men replaced after a goalless first half.
