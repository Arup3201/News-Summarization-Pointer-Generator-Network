Dangling your legs nearly 400ft up in the air is not a thing for the fainthearted. Add a 40mph spin and even the bravest thrillseeker may think twice.

This a ride on the Eclipse, the world’s tallest chair carousel, opening in Stockholm this weekend.

Standing at a neck-bending 397ft tall, it offers panoramic views of the Swedish capital - for those brave enough to keep their eyes open.

Riding high: Eclipse, the world's tallest chair swing carousel is nearly 400ft high and will take you on a 44mph ride - if you dare!

Riders squeal in delight as the 12 swings hit the top speed of 44mph at Sweden’s oldest theme park Gröna Lund, located at the heart of the city.

The amusement park already boasts 30 rides on the 15-acre site and attracts 1.2million visitors per year – quite a feat in a city with an urban population of just over 1.35million.

Eclipse has already been given the seal of approval by Sweden’s first (and only) astronaut, Christer Fuglesang, who was its first passenger at the opening ceremony.

Justin out-screamed: A Justin Bieber fan and her friend shout in delight as they enjoy one of the first spins on Eclipse

The seats can take two riders each and hang on 8ft chains which are sent in a dizzying spin, high above the rooftops.

For those who still find this a mundane ride, the panoramic view of Stockholm may be worth a ticket alone.

If worst comes to worst, the double seats offer a shot at getting close to the locals - last year Travelers Digest named Stockholm as the city where you find the sexiest men, as well as the second most beautiful women, in the world
