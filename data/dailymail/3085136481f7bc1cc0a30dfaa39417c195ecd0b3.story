A new line of smart toys powered by the supercomputer, IBM Watson, could allow children to have personalised conversations with their toys.

The 'CogniToys' are designed to aid a child's development, allowing them to ask questions and receive an age-appropriate reply within a matter of seconds.

The company behind the design is now hoping to launch its range of supercomputer-powered dinosaur toys using a crowd funding campaign.

The dinosaur range has been created by New York-based group, Elemental Path, who is currently attempting to raise $50,000 (£32,500) on Kickstarter to take the toys into production.

The toy's chest features a large button that, when pressed, begins the interaction.

In a recent focus group in Pennsylvania, children asked the toy questions like, 'How far away is the moon?' and 'Who is Barack Obama?', according to the New York Observer.

'Each toy will get to know the child and grow with him/her, interacting directly with them to create an experience around each child's personal interests,' the company writes on Kickstarter.

They don’t need feeding, cleaning or taking for a walk - they are the robotic pets for a generation of children raised on tech and tablets.

A new era of sophisticated robotic pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry.

The techno-pets offer the advantage that they will not make a mess on the carpet or demand they are taken for a walk, making them a more practical option than a puppy or kitten for busy families.

Roland Earl, director general of the British Toy and Hobby Association said: ‘There a lot of virtual pets, even the intelligent robots we are seeing might be seen as a pet substitute.

‘They are something to interact with that does not need feeding or cleaning up after.

'Some of the toys are incredibly clever. One of the most popular toys of last year was a parrot that you could talk to and it would then repeat back the words. That was endless fun. Kids really enjoyed that.’ 

'The toy will explore favourite colours, favourite toys, interests and use these to customise engagement.

'Even better, the toy has a personality of its own that changes over time.'

Elemental Path was put together after they won a developer competition which allowed them access to the IBM Watson technology.

The supercomputer originally rose to fame after beating quiz show champion Ken Jennings at Jeopardy

With the IBM Watson-powered system, the toy can respond to questions within a second, the company claims. 

Within the dinosaur, there is a speaker, microphone, battery pack, and a small piece of hardware that connects to the cloud.

The toy is also designed to become smarter the more it is used. For instance, questions that have previously been asked, will be responded to faster the second time.

Prototypes of the CogniToys dinosaur are already being created using 3D printing system. 

The current design is aimed at children aged four to seven, and the system can be customised to include information such as the child's name and age.

Early adopters can order the toy on Kickstarter for $99 (£65). The toys are expected to begin shipping on November 1st.
