Spanking and whipping should not be banned in British-made online porn videos, Lib Dem MPs have demanded.

Backbench MP Julian Huppert attacked rules revealed last week which ban a host of erotic acts considered 'harmful' by ministers.

The new laws aim to bring 'video-on-demand' online porn into line with videos sold in licensed sex shops.

It means around 10 acts - ranging from spanking to strangulation, aggressive whipping and being tied up – are now banned from web porn sold in the UK.

Mr Huppert has tabled a Commons motion calling for the new rules – laid down in the Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 – to be annulled.

Mr Huppert, MP for Cambridge, said the new rules 'mean that all video-on-demand services that originate from the UK can't show various acts, such as spanking'.

He said: 'It seems to me to be very odd to say that this - assuming it is consensual - is acceptable for somebody to do in their own home, for them to photograph it, film it, but not to look at it online if it comes from the UK.

'To me the case for banning things should be driven by issues around consent, and around genuine risk, not about whether we happen to like things or not.'

Banned content includes 'the portrayal of sexual activity which involves real or apparent lack of consent' and 'the infliction of pain or acts which may cause lasting physical harm'.

This effectively outlaws acts including physical or verbal abuse (whether or not it is consensual), physical restraint, caning and strangulation.

A Government spokesman said: 'The legislation provides the same level of protection to the online world that exists on the high street in relation to the sale of physical DVDs.

'In a converging media world these provisions must be coherent and the BBFC classification regime is a tried and tested system of what content is regarded as harmful for minors.'

But critics argue the change not only damages the country's porn industry, with online viewers still able to access content banned in the UK by watching videos filmed abroad, but amounts to 'arbitrary censorship'.

A number of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' style sex acts have been banned from online porn made in the UK. A movie based on the erotic novel is currently being made staring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson (pictured)

Spanking and whipping, which are featured in the saucy novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are on the banned list, as well as: 

Aggressive whipping 

Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of if consensual)  

Strangulation 

Jerry Barnett, founder of anti-censorship campaign Sex And Censorship, told Vice News: 'R18 is a strange thing.

'It's a set of weird and arbitrary censorship rules decided between the BBFC, the police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service).

'There appear to be no rational explanations for most of the R18 rules - they're simply a set of moral judgments designed by people who have struggled endlessly to stop the British people from watching pornography.'

The Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 came in to effect on Monday.

Erotic film director Erika Lust told the Independent: 'With this legislation, the UK is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring, unrealistic, male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty, where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality.

'Women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence.'
