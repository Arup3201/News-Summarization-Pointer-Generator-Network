Deterrent: A Trident missile launches from a nuclear-powered submarine

Liberal Democrat plans to downgrade Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent represent a ‘risk no responsible government would take’, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned last night.

In a strongly-worded article for the Daily Mail, Mr Hammond accuses Nick Clegg of taking a ‘reckless’ gamble with national security by pushing for the trusted Trident system to be replaced by a cut-down deterrent.

His intervention comes as leaked documents reveal an extraordinary Lib Dem plan to halve the number of Trident submarines  from four to two and send them to sea unarmed.

Tomorrow Mr Hammond will publish a formal review of alternatives to the Trident system. The review was demanded by Mr Clegg, whose party is pushing for an end to the continuous at-sea deterrent that has kept Britain safe for 45 years. 

Mr Hammond makes it clear that both he and David Cameron have already rejected any alternative to a full replacement of the existing system.

He says the Government remains ‘100 per cent committed to maintaining and renewing the Trident system’, which uses a fleet of submarines to keep Britain’s nuclear missiles permanently at unknown locations at sea. 

Tridents are carried on board four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered submarines operating out of Faslane on the Clyde. 

The ageing fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid-2020s. The Conservatives and Labour want to replace it with a new £20billion generation of state-of-the-art submarines, which would cost about £3billion a year to run. A decision will not be taken until 2016.

The Lib Dems are pushing for the fleet to be cut to three, or even two, with the missiles left at vulnerable locations on land most of the time. They argue that it is time to move on from the Cold War.

Mr Hammond says the move would make little difference to the cost of renewing the Trident system, but would pose an unacceptable risk at a time when there are more than 17,000 nuclear weapons in the world and a string of hostile states such as Iran trying to obtain them.

‘History teaches us that the  defence of this country means being ready for the unexpected,’ Mr  Hammond says. 

Documents leaked to the Daily Mail reveal Lib Dem proposals to build only two new submarines to replace the current four. This would end the requirement for one to be always on patrol at sea.

The proposal, which will be debated at the party’s annual conference in September, was finalised by a high-level Lib Dem working group involving Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.

Critics said having only two boats meant every other nation would know when the UK had an unarmed submarine at sea, undermining the deterrent effect.

They also said having a ‘declaratory policy’ of deploying only unarmed missiles would be a ‘gift’ to other nations.

A well-placed Whitehall source said: ‘Hostile leaders around the globe would sigh with relief that the UK was no longer a serious military nation.’
