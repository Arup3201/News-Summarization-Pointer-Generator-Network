Ministers are considering draconian plans to prevent a flood of money and people heading to Britain from Europe if the ailing single currency collapses.

Experts fear that the collapse of the euro would lead to the widespread movement of both people and money – with potentially damaging consequences for Britain if left unchecked.

The Treasury has drawn up contingency plans to prevent investors shifting huge sums of cash from the Eurozone to Britain – amid fears it could lead to a surge in the value of the Pound.

And it emerged yesterday that Britain’s borders could also be temporarily sealed against economic refugees from Europe if the collapse of the euro sparks widespread civil unrest on the Continent.

The Foreign Office is also working on contingency plans for the emergency evacuation of thousands of British expats and holidaymakers from stricken countries.

Officials insist the plans are being 
drawn up as a precaution – and do not indicate that the Government 
believes the collapse of the single currency is imminent.

Despite repeated attempts by Eurozone
 countries to prop up the single currency, many experts believe the 
17-member currency cannot survive the coming year intact.

British
 officials believe that one or more countries, such as Greece and 
Portugal, could be forced to drop out of the single currency in order to
 tackle the dire problems in their own economies.

Ministers
 fear the break-up of the euro could have a devastating effect on 
Britain, dashing hopes of a recovery and sending the economy back into 
recession.

Anecdotal reports suggest some 
wealthy investors and individuals from countries like Greece are already
 moving money to the UK and buying property in London.

The
 Treasury, which has a central role in drawing up contingency plans for 
the euro’s collapse, believes a break-up could send international 
investors scrambling for a safe haven.

The
 transfer of huge sums of money to London could send Sterling soaring – 
threatening to crush the fragile recovery in exports which is central to
 the Coalition’s plans to ‘rebalance’ Britain’s economy.

Earlier this year the Swiss 
government was forced to intervene after nervous investors transferred 
cash there from the Eurozone, sending the value of the Swiss Franc to 
unsustainable levels.

The Swiss authorities moved to peg the currency to the euro.

Desperate banks have stashed record amounts of cash in the European Central Bank amid fears they could be hit by a Eurozone breakup.

Institutions across Europe ploughed 412billion euros into the deposit facility which is seen as a safe heaven during economic turmoil.

The ECB gives a paltry interest rate of just 0.25 per cent  - meaning that many banks are making a loss on their cash.

It is a further sign of the anxiety in the financial system, coming just days after 520 banks borrowed 489billion euros from the ECB. The three-year loans were aimed to reduce fears over the banks access to capital during the crisis.

Banks had previously been lending to each other on the international markets but levels have slumped in recent months.

A fall in Italy's borrowing costs eased fears about the eurozone debt crisis today and helped London's leading shares index push back into the black.

The successful Italian bond auction saw the debt-ridden nation's borrowing costs fall back from the unsustainable levels of seven per cent seen months earlier, as market confidence grew in its ability to pay its way.

In November there were fears that it would breach the level after it hit 6.504 per cent.

Today's rate, however, was 3.251 per cent.

Silvio Berlusconi's replacement by Mario Monti as prime minister in November has helped calm nerves although there is still concern about the impact on the economy of a draconian plan of tax increases and pensions adopted this month.

The
 Treasury is planning a different approach which will impose strict 
limits on the amount of money that can be moved in or out of the UK.

Treasury officials are also drawing 
up plans to deal with the impact on Britain’ s major banks, which have a
 combined exposure of £170 billion to the troubled economies of Greece, 
Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain.

Elsewhere
 in Whitehall there are fears that a collapse of the euro could lead to 
widespread civil unrest – and even spark a flood of economic refugees.

Some
 countries are expected to ground all flights and effectively seal their
 borders to prevent the flight of people and money. British officials 
are said to be considering contingency plans to seal the UK’s borders in
 a worst-case scenario – although any attempt to prevent the free 
movement of people is illegal under EU law.

The Ministry of Defence has also been put on standby to help rescue British nationals stranded in countries that are plunged into chaos.

Other EU countries are also drawing up contingency plans.

Earlier this month reports in Portugal said the country’s borders would be temporarily sealed if the country drops out of the single currency.

Strict limits would be imposed on cash withdrawals and euro notes would be stamped with an escudo mark until the new currency was printed and distributed.

A poll of Conservative Party members has found that most Tories want Britain to pull out of the European Union.

The party asked its members on its website if they would favour ending Britain's EU membership and signing up to a free-trade agreement.

It found that 54 per cent would back pulling out.

A quarter said they wanted a more flexible relationship while 10 per cent would keep the status quo but ignore laws that were not in the national interest.

Five per cent said the UK should leave without seeking new agreements and three per cent said they were happy with the current relationship but with no further integration.

Two per cent said they wanted more involvement while one per cent wanted to join the euro.

Baroness Thatcher is the politician whose views they most closely indentified with, followed by London mayor Boris Johnson and former US president Ronald Reagan.

David Cameron trails in eighth place, only just ahead of UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage.

ConservativeHome surveyed 1,566 Conservative Party members on December 22 and 23.
