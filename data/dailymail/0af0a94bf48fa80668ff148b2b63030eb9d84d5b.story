It's traditionally the time of year that families get together and give thanks.

But one Pennsylvania man  was less than thankful when his girlfriend  stabbed him  with a knife because she got angry that he started eating their Thanksgiving dinner while she slept off a bender.

Jack-Lyn Blake, 47, went berserk and chased boyfriend Benjamin Smith around their dining room table after waking to find he had eaten without her.

She allegedly plunged the knife into his chest before throwing the weapon at his face.

Officers responded to the scene and found her boyfriend inside holding a towel over his chest. 

Blake allegedly said when the cops arrived: 'I stabbed him.' 

Smith was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.

Blake was taken to Luzerne County jail, according to The Smoking Gun.

She has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, simple assault, reckless endangerment and making terror threats.

It wasn't clear if she has a lawyer.
