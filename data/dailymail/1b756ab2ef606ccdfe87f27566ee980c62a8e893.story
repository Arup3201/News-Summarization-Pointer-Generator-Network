In the closet: The girl¿s mother discovered Workman when she went to put some of her daughter's belongings in the closet

According to deputies, Workman lived in his victim’s closet from April 27 until May 2. The girl’s mother discovered him when she went to put some of her daughter’s belongings in the closet.

‘I was sorta shocked more than anything. I asked him who he was and he said Jarred Workman and he was 19,’ the mother, who asked not to be identified, told WSOCTV.

Workman then ran off leaving his wallet and cell phone behind.

The girl told police that she and Workman had started speaking online about a month before they met in person.

They arranged to meet near her parents’ house in northern Iredell County in late April.

The girl then invited the man into the house and that is when he started to sexually assault her, investigators said.

‘Just the fact that he would be that brazen. To come up here and meet a girl online and then stay in her residence not knowing what her parents are or what they are about,’ said Iredell County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Bill Hamby.

After interviewing the girl, deputies put out a warrant for Workman's arrest.

'I'm uncomfortable in my own home. I'm scared. I can't sleep at night,' the teenager’s mother said.

She wants other parents to know the importance of monitoring their children's online activity.

'The internet has just ruined that poor girl. She was just taken advantage of,' she said.

Investigators said Workman has a handful of prior arrests and faces charges in another sexual assault case.
