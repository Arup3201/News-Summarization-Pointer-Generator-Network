Nottingham has overtaken Liverpool and Glasgow to become Britain’s unemployment capital.

Just over 30 per cent of families in the East Midlands city are jobless – ahead of Glasgow, where 29.8 per cent of households have no-one in work. In Liverpool just over one in four homes is jobless.

The highest percentage of workless households in Wales is in the Central Valleys where 23.8 per cent of households are jobless, while in Northern Ireland one in five families have no-one in work.

Nottingham has been crowned Britain's jobless capital by the Office for National Statistics in its annual study into workless households

The areas with the lowest proportion of jobless homes were all in the South East, with West Sussex topping the list – with just 9 per cent of families out of work.

West Sussex is followed by Surrey, Berkshire and Hertfordshire as the best areas for employment - all recording jobless rates of around 10 per cent.

The Office for National Statistics said Nottingham had been hit by the decline of its textiles industry during the 1950s and 1960s.

The city’s jobless rate is also skewed by a large number of students at its two universities.

Once student households are stripped out Glasgow had the highest proportion of workless families - with 28.6 per cent of households without a job.

Nearby Ayrshire is in second - with 28.5 per cent of families in the area out of work. Without students Nottingham sits in third place – with a jobless rate of 27.5 per cent.

Glasgow and Liverpool have remained in the top five workless areas since records began in 2004.

According to the Office for National Statistics Glasgow, Liverpool, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Ayrshire have the highest proportion of jobless families

England has a lower proportion of jobless families claiming to be sick or disabled - but a higher proportion in study

According to the Office for National Statistics ‘the common link among some of the areas with the highest percentage of workless households is that they were all heavily industrialised in the last century’.

‘Glasgow was once a major force in shipbuilding as well as other engineering but competition overseas has seen that decline since the 1960s.

‘Liverpool had a large manufacturing base and one of the UK’s largest docks, which have both been in decline since the 1970s.

‘Wolverhampton also saw a decline in its iron and steel works industry during the twentieth century.’

Long-term sickness is the most common reason given for being out of work.

In Northern Ireland, of the people living in workless households, 36.4 per cent said they were not working because of sickness or disability.

In Scotland, 33.7 per cent gave this reason with 28.5 per cent in Wales and 26.6 per cent in England.

Across the regions of England the lowest percentage not working because of sickness or disability was in London where 22.2 per cent of people in workless households gave this reason.
