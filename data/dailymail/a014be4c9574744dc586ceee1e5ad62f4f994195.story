A white supremacist will be executed on Wednesday for killing an Indian man in a string of hate crimes in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

Mark Anthony Stroman, who is on death row in Texas, said the spree, in which he also shot dead a Pakistani man and severely wounded a Bangladeshi man, was fuelled by 'patriotism'.

He said that he believed his targets were of Middle Eastern background and that after 9/11, the U.S. government 'hadn't done their job, so he was going to do it for them'.

But the only surviving one of 41-year-old's victims is suing the governor in a last minute bid to save his attacker's life.

Sentenced to death: Mark Stroman is due to be executed on Wednesday

Stroman began plotting what he believed were revenge attacks in the days after September 11.

'Let's just say that I could not think clearly anymore and I am sorry to say I made innocent people pay for my rage, anger, grief and loss,' he wrote in a recent blog posting from jail.

Stroman said his sister was in the top floors of the World Trade Center's North tower when it collapsed after being hit by an airplane, although this claim has never been substantiated.

On September 15, he shot Waqar Hasan, a 46-year-old Pakistani man, in the head while he was grilling hamburgers in a convenience store in Dallas. He had only recently moved to the area to start a new life with his family.

Six days later, he shot Raisuddin 
Bhuiyan, in the face while he worked at a gas station. The Bangladeshi 
man survived but was blinded in one eye.

Then, on October 4, he attempted to rob a gas station run by Vasudev Patel.

Execution: Mark Stroman will be killed by lethal injection for the attacks

He approached the counter with a .44-calibre pistol and demanded, 'Open the register or I'll kill you,' before shooting the 49-year-old.Stroman, who is a father-of-four, was denied a stay of execution by the Supreme Court last month.

He has claimed remorse and his supporters are urging the governor and the state Board of Pardons and Parole to grant clemency.

His only surviving victim, Mr Bhuiyan, is suing the governor, Rick Perry, in an effort to save the life of the man who tried to take his.

'Please do the right thing, save a human life, please,' said the devote Muslim who is begging for mercy for Stroman.

'Please, listen to my request and lower Mark’s punishment from death to 
life in prison,' he said.

'If the Governor of Texas and the Board of 
Pardons and Parole can listen to the victims when they want revenge, why
can they not listen when the victims are asking for mercy?

Forgiveness: Stroman said that he is sorry for the string of attacks

Patriotism: Stroman said that he was seeking revenge after the 9/11 attacks

'I strongly believe Mark Stroman is a different person. I believe if Mark is given a chance to live, he will become a spokesperson in raising awareness for hate crimes.'

He added: 'He is another human being like me, and if given the chance I would definitely give him a hug to show him I have nothing against him at this moment.

'I forgave Mark Stroman several years back. Let’s break the cycle of hate and violence.'

A year after the killings, Stroman, who once belonged to the Aryan Brotherhood white supremacist prison gang, wrote on his blog: 'This was not a crime of hate but an act of Passion and Patriotism, an act of country and commitment, an act of retribution and recompense.

'The was not done during Peace time but at War time.

'I, Mark Anthony Stroman, felt a need to exact some measure of equality and fairness for the thousands of victims of September 11th, 2001, for the United States of America and its people, The People of this Great Country.

'GOD BLESS AMERICA."

Stroman, who is being held at the Polunsky Correctional Unit in Livingston, has a criminal history of burglary, armed robbery and theft.

He will be killed by lethal injection on Wednesday.
