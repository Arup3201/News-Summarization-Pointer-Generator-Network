New research has found that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life

If you are struck down by the winter blues, take heart, for things will soon start to feel better.

Not only is spring on the way, but new research has concluded that as humans we all have a tendency to look on the bright side of life.

A large study of languages spoken across the globe revealed that optimism is ingrained in human nature.

Scientists from Australia and the US studied the 100,000 most-common words used in the world’s ten most-spoken languages.

Using mathematical analysis, they found that no matter their culture, people are far more likely to use positive words than negative ones.

The study, which looked at the most popular words used in newspapers, books, films, the internet and on the Twitter social media site, found that humans have a natural tendency to look at life with a cheerful slant.

Dr Lewis Mitchell, from the University of Adelaide, said: ‘Happiness is obviously important, but tough to define and measure.

‘We want to be able to do this in a data-driven, open-source way, so that both the public and policymakers can consult these metrics on a daily basis, as they might interest rates or stock tickers.’

He added: ‘It doesn’t matter whether it’s English, Spanish, Russian or Chinese ─ the words that make up our languages are universally biased towards positive emotions.’

The researchers analysed the 10,000 most spoken words in each of ten languages - English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Indonesian, Chinese, Korean and Russian.

They asked native speakers to rate whether those words were ‘happy’ or ‘sad’ on a 1 to 9 scale.

The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last night (Monday), revealed a positive slant in the way in which humans communicate, no matter the language.

Even though all ten languages were positively biased, there were some differences between them - Spanish and Portuguese were the ‘happiest’ and Chinese, Korean and Russian were the ‘saddest’.

The research provides evidence which backs up the ‘Polyanna hypothesis’ which holds that the human subconscious naturally leans towards optimism.

It also explains previous research which shows that people often expect too much out of life.

For example, we know that around 50 per cent of marriages end in divorce, but even people who have had a number of failed marriages continue to tie the knot again.

This tendency, which psychologists call the ‘triumph of hope over experience’, means we also tend to think we will live longer and be more successful than average, and underestimate our likelihood of having cancer.
