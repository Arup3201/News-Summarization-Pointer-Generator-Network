Plans are underway to make the biggest heavyweight fight on British soil since Frank Bruno fought Lennox Lewis, with Anthony Joshua’s camp hopeful of delivering a domestic blockbuster against Tyson Fury next summer.

Much will depend on whether Wladimir Klitschko honours Fury’s status as mandatory challenger for his WBO title.

But with Fury admitting significant doubts that the Ukrainian great will meet him next summer, Sportsmail has been told Joshua’s team are now actively considering the possibility of a fight that would pose an enormous challenge in what has so far been a devastating surge through the professional ranks.

Joshua v Fury would be an all-English blockbuster with both unbeaten in 10 and 23 fights respectively

Whatever reservations there might have been over Joshua’s readiness for a dangerous opponent such as Fury seem to have all but disappeared, with both men extending their unbeaten records to 10 and 23 fights respectively in the past fortnight.

Joshua, 25, will on Wednesday hold a press conference to discuss his January 31 fight with America’s Kevin Johnson at London’s 02 Arena – a bout first revealed by Sportsmail in October.

A huge match-up with one of the most divisive figures in the sport would then possibly take place at the O2 in London, with each man certain to land the biggest paydays of their careers to date.

Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, wrote in his MailOnline column: ‘Tyson Fury is on the horizon for next summer.

'We are moving towards the inevitable, which is a fight with Fury and the other top domestic fighters. It's going to be great times for British boxing. 

'I watched the main event from the show at the ExCel at the weekend and I have to say Fury-Dereck Chisora (which Fury won when Chisora retired at the end of the 10th) was one of the dullest heavyweight fights I have seen. 

Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn says a Fury bout for the young heavyweight is inevitable

'Fury is a great character and a quality fighter but do you really see him coping with Anthony’s power, speed and work rate? Do you not think Anthony would have blasted Chisora out of there far earlier?

'People ask if AJ is ready to fight Fury but, to be honest, is Fury ready to fight AJ? I believe this is a fight that will bring both men to new levels in terms of financial rewards. It's a numbers game and these numbers add up.'

Klitschko remains a significant obstacle to the fight, with the 38-year-old expected to defend his WBO, WBA and IBF belts in March.

He would then have four months to fight Fury, 26, whose convincing yet unspectacular dismantling on Chisora made him the mandatory challenger for the WBO strap.

Fury is convinced Klistchko will sidestep him before retiring, saying: ‘I believe he’s got one or two more fights. I don’t believe he’s going to fight me.

‘He will fight some American and he will probably try to get the unification fight with (WBC champion) Bermane Stiverne.

‘He will probably beat Stiverne and then retire as a great, great champion. If he does that, good luck to him. If he doesn’t, I’m here. 

Fury's win came after Chisora retired at the end of the 10th round at the Excel in London

‘He’s made around 20 title defences - he’s ruled the division for a long time. It’s time for new blood in the division and that new blood is me.’

That much is open to debate, such has been Joshua’s rapid and dramatic rise since turning professional after winning gold in the London Olympics.

Only one of Joshua’s 10 fights to date has reached the third round, with faded former European champion Michael Sprott demolished within two minutes in his last outing on November 22.

Johnson will surely provide more of a test, having gone the distance with Vitali Klitschko, Fury and Chisora. There is then the possibility of a final fight before he steps in with Fury in what would be one of the most anticipated match-ups in British boxing’s recent history.

Fury used his Twitter account in October to challenge Joshua to meet him in the ring, with the giant Mancunian desperate to fight more regularly after missing out on a £5million payday when David Haye pulled out of their scheduled fight last year.
