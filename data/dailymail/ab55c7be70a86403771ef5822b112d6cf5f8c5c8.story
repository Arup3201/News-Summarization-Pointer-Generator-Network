Video producer Mr Francis, 41, and Miss Wilson, 26, first revealed that they were to become parents in April.

The announcement sparked controversy at the time because the couple told how they conceived via IVF in order that they could choose the gender of their children.

Miss Wilson told Us Weekly at the time: 'We both wanted girls and we wanted them to be healthy and free of genetic diseases so we chose to do IVF.' 

Mr Francis added: 'I believe people will finally understand my love, respect and admiration for women. I love girls.'

Mr Francis, who has long been a hero to teenage boys in spite of his multiple lawsuits and arrests, was introduced to Abbey Wilson when she won Girls Gone Wild's 'Search for the Hottest Girl in America'. 

The couple boast many famous friends, who they said had been offering plenty of parenting advice. 

'Kourtney and Scott were the first in the Kardashian family we told and they have already given us so much amazing advice,' Mr Francis said.

Miss Wilson also noted that Mario and Courtney Lopez had taken them baby shopping already.

Mr Francis' notoriety came with the launch of his company Girls Gone Wild in the late 1990s. 

Gender selection is not an open practice, particularly for couples having their first children, but some doctors do bend the rules.

Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and India all have outright bans on genetic selection for non-medical purposes, but the United States does not.

In the United States, pre-natal genetic diagnosis tests are available which allows the couple to determine the gender of the embryo before it is implanted.

Fertility clinics make their own rules on where they stand in the issue, so certain clinics allow sex selection on any grounds while others dictate that couples need a medical reason- like certain developmental disorders or genetic diseases- as grounds for dictating the sex.

An example of a more loose interpretation of the law used by some couples is when they already have several children of the same sex and opt to use IVF to make sure their next child is the opposite sex.

His crew would go to debaucherous events like Mardi Gras and Spring Break resorts to make videos of female college students who took their tops off in front of the camera. 

Business boomed: the company was established formally in 1997 and had profits of more than $20million in their first two years. In their first five years, they had created more than 80 different Girls Gone Wild videos. 

The films, like 'Girls Gone Wild: Horny Schoolgirls – Orgy Party' and 'Girls Gone Wild: Sex Starved Young & Horny', were available on pay-per-view channels and later through a streaming service on their website.

A string of lawsuits and Mr Francis' own personal criminal troubles contributed to the downward spiral of the company, and Girls Gone Wild filed for bankruptcy in February of last year.

Mr Francis spent time in jail after pleading no contest to child abuse and prostitution charges in 2008 and spent nearly a year in jail.

More recently, he was charged with false imprisonment and assault in 2013 stemming from a night in 2011 in which he grabbed a woman by the neck and slammed her head into the floor of his soon-to-be repossessed home. 

Mr Francis became violent when he tried to separate one woman from a group of three that went back to his home against their will and they objected. He then tried intimidating the other two into not calling the police.

In 2012, Mr Francis was ordered by a judge to pay $19million to casino magnate Steve Wynn in a defamation lawsuit. He was sentenced to 270 days in jail and forced to complete and anger management course.

He later said that he was wrongly accused and accepted the plea deal in order to end his time in jail.
