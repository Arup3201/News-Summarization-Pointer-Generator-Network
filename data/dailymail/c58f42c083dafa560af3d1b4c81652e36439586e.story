University officials have been accused of having Casper killed as his presence during lectures was damaging its reputation as one of the top universities in China.

Student Xiong Hou, 21, said: 'It was felt the dog had a really good influence on people, and as far as I know none of the lecturers objective. 

'Sometimes they would joke that only the dog was paying attention. I think he liked the English classes and calculus because the seats were best there for him to sleep on.

'But when he didn't turn up at the canteen at midday which he usually did to get food with the rest of us, somebody was horrified to see his body in the bin. 

'Apparently he had been poisoned by university officials.'

A spokesman for the university confirmed that the dog together with other stray dogs on the campus had been killed, saying that they were a potential danger to the teachers and students.

The spokesman said: 'We cannot tolerate strays on the campus as they make a mess and also pose a risk that they might bite someone, which ultimately means it's our responsibility.'

Another student at the University, Xiao Wang, 23, added: 'It wasn't necessary to kill Casper, he would sit all day long in classes so he was hardly a threat to anyone. 

'They were just embarrassed that he made them look unprofessional. But actually I think having a pet in the class is actually progressive and forward-thinking. Many people are very sad.'
