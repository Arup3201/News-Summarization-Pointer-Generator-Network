The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite filmmaker Roman Polanski over a 1977 child sex crime conviction, officials said on Wednesday.

A lawyer for the director - viewed by many Poles as one of
their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish
prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go
free, and since then nothing had changed.

Polanski, 81, who was born to Polish parents but lives in
France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of
Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film.

Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's
office in Warsaw, said the extradition request, which came from
prosecutors in Los Angeles, will be passed on to the
prosecutors' office in Krakow.

'Prosecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning,'
Martyniuk said. The spokesman said that as a rule Poland does not extradite its citizens. 

In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed
Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977
conviction. 

They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and
they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on
any further steps.

'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could
lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in
October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz,
told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday.

The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex
with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los
Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs.

Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea
bargain. He fled the United States the following year, believing
the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him
in jail for years.

In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich
on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. 

He was freed
in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to
the United States.

His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish
authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow
to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus
affair, without risking another arrest.

Paris-born Polanski spent his childhood and youth in Poland but lives in France. He holds Polish and French passports.
