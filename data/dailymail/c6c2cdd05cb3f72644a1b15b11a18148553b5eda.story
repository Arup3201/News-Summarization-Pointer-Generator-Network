A Washington state father killed his adult daughter and left his son fighting for life after shooting them both in the head as they slept 'to get rid of their demons.'

Michael League, 69, shot Danielle Faucett, 43, and Dennis League, 46, at around 3:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at his house in Puyallup, while his grandchildren slept just feet away.

He father then called 911 and confessed to shooting his children before threatening to take his own life.

On the heart-breaking call, League said, crying: 'I just committed a father's worst sin. I just shot my daughter in the head and my son in the head. I had to put them out of their misery and get rid of their demons. I'm going to have to shoot myself.'

He went on to tell the dispatcher that drugs had plagued his family.

'It's all because of alcohol and drugs. It tore our family apart,' he said on the call.

League explained that he and his wife went away for a few days and when they returned, they found their daughter allegedly tried to attack her brother with a knife.

'My wife was about to have a nervous breakdown,' he said. 'I want to die.'

Deputy Chief Dave McDonald said officers
rushed to the scene and surrounded the home while dispatchers talked 
the man into putting his gun down. He then surrendered moments later and
police took him into custody.

Officers entered the home and found 
two gravely wounded victims in different rooms of the house, one 
upstairs and one downstairs.

Both suffered gunshots to the head and 
appear to have been shot in their sleep, McDonald said. 

The
victims were rushed by Central Pierce Fire & Rescue medics to 
Tacoma General Hospital, where Faucett died of her injuries within hours
of the shooting and her brother remains fighting for his life. He is not expected to survive.

Also
in the home were two boys, ages 6 and 7, as well as Michael League's 
wife, all of whom were unharmed and taken from the property.

Police believe the man shot is the father of the young children.

According to the Tacoma News Tribune, League's wife told investigators that her adult children living were living with them and that it had been causing her and her husband a lot of stress. She said the son has an alcohol problem and their daughter is schizophrenic

League confessed to shooting his children with a .22-caliber pistol and told police he used a pillow to muffle the sound of the gunfire so his wife and two grandchildren wouldn't wake up, according to court records.

Police have responded several times to the home for domestic violence-related disputes, McDonald said.

Those incidents always involved disputes between adult family members, such as the children and the grandparents.

'I know they were frustrated,' McDonald said about the grandparents.

A neighbor said police have responded before to deal with the couple's son.

Arraigned: Michael League, pictured left from behind, was arraigned in Pierce County Superior Court on Monday

'It was common to hear fighting with the son,' said the neighbor, Beau Nye.

He said two young boys live at the house with the grandparents.

'They were playing all day yesterday,' Nye said of the boys. 'Chasing each other and laughing. They were having a great time.'

League was charged with first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder at an arraignment on Monday.

Sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a padded prison smock reserved for suicidal inmates, the 69-year-old hung his head and cried in court as the charges were read.

He has pleaded not guilty. Court Commissioner Meagan Foley ordered League jailed in lieu of $2 million bail.

Raymond McArthur, a friend of League's, described the 69-year-old as 'a broken man' after Monday's arraignment.

'That's not the friend I know,' he told reporters outside court. 'Something snapped.'
