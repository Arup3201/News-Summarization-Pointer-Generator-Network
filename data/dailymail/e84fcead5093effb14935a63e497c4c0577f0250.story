A woman who killed her lover by striking him over the head with a hammer has been jailed for seven years.

Nadia Boukhari, 43, hit Paul Duffy repeatedly over the head after saying she suffered two years of abuse at his hands.

Her co-accused, John Green, 48, stabbed Mr Duffy in the back at a house close to the home they shared  in Stoke Newington, North London.

Mr Duffy, a 40-year-old former boxer, hit her in the face after she refused to give him a cigarette moments before the attack took place.

She was two months pregnant with their first child but suffered a miscarriage following the fight.

The jury took just three hours to convict Green of murder while Boukhari was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter following the three-week trial.

Green was handed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 14 years. Judge Brian Barker QC said they had killed Mr Duffy following an 'explosion of violent temper'.

'The behaviour in that room was blind and selfish, and the catastrophic results all too familiar in these courts,' he said.

'In my view, your actions were a complete over-reaction to Mr Duffy's aggressive and drunken behaviour. A life has been thrown away.'

Addressing Boukhari, he said: 'You were the victim of an attack in the house and there was an element of both provocation and self-defence.

'But your reactive acts were totally disproportionate.'

Duffy and Boukhari had been living with Green, an unemployed caretaker, shortly prior to the killing.

The fight broke out in the lounge of a mutual friend, Daniel McNamara, who lived near them, shortly before 12.30pm on January 5 this year.

Green stabbed Mr Duffy with a knife and Boukhari struck him on the back of the head with a hammer, fracturing his skull.

A jury at the Old Bailey in Central London took just three hours to find Boukhari guilty of manslaughter and Green guilty of murder

Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said: 'Shortly before Mr Duffy was assaulted by these two defendants, he had gone to the address to confront Green and assaulted Nadia Boukhari.

'It appears one possibility is that he suspected there was something going on between them.'

Green had told jurors at the Old Bailey that he was not in the house when the murder happened and he saw a badly injured Mr Duffy when went back to get his bus pass.

However, they did not believe him and convicted him of murder.

Boukhari, who emigrated to the UK from Morocco in 2008, claimed Green was the knife-man and had denied using the hammer.

She then changed her story to say she had acted in self-defence.

Boukhari was found guilty of manslaughter after hearing about the 'turbulent relationship' she had with Mr Duffy, who had been violent towards her on numerous occasions.

Defence barrister Ann Cotcher QC said Boukhari had been assaulted repeatedly throughout her stormy two-year relationship with Mr Duffy, and had been punched twice in the face earlier on the day of the killing.

'Nadia Boukhari told the court she was generally assaulted three or four times a week,' she said.

'If she's even nearly right, that runs into tens, if not hundreds, of occasions.

She added: 'For simply being refused a cigarette, he launched an attack on Ms Boukhari, the seriousness of which she had never experienced before.

'The attack continued for some time and almost immediately that it finished, she picked up a hammer.

'It was the extreme violence that made her use it.

'This was a strong man, said to be a boxer or bare-knuckle fighter, fighting a woman.

'The cumulative effect of being abused time after time after time may well have had some bearing on how she behaved on that occasion.'
