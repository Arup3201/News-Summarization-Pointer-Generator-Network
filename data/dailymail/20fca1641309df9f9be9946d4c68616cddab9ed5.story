According to Sister Mary Michael, it will stand as a ‘symbol of hope’ offering ‘spiritual protection’ to all who look at it.

But the nun’s plan to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross at the bottom of her 30ft long garden has left her neighbours, well, cross.

Sister Mary, 68, has triggered an almighty debate after lodging a planning application to build the LED-lit cross in the back  garden of her two-bedroom bungalow. She says she plans three hours of prayers at the cross each day.

Godly garden: Sister Michael included an example of what her illuminated cross might look like in her application to council

The nun says the ‘Cross of Love’ 
would be 24ft high, with the cross beam measuring 4ft, lit in blue and 
white which would ‘not obliterate anyone’s view’.

She is now ‘earnestly praying for the money to come in’ to fund the structure.

It would be a 1/100th scale replica 
of the Glorious Cross of Dozule which was proposed to mark claims made 
in the 1970s by a woman from the Normandy village of Dozule that she had
seen Christ 49 times.

Although the cross was never built, around 4,000 scale-sized crosses are said to have been built around the world.

Fiona Billings, who lives at the rear
of Sister Mary’s home in North Hykeham, near Lincoln, said the 
structure was not in keeping with a residential area, would be visible 
from her property and would cause light pollution.

Neighbours object: Nearby residents have objected to the plans saying the shining cross at the nun's house in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire (pictured) will be an eyesore and 'a blight on the skyline'

Decision pending: The plans showing the cross' dimensions (pictured) are before North Kesteven District Council

Mark Dingley, objecting on behalf of an elderly relative, said: ‘The light will be shining straight into her bedroom.’

Others, though, welcomed Sister 
Mary’s plans. One resident said an illuminated cross would complement 
and unite Lincoln and Lincolnshire with a unique identity.

Sister Mary said yesterday: ‘I have 
spoken to an architect who has come up with  some plans. It would be 
made of steel and  we want the light to bring hope and confidence to 
people. I have spoken to the neighbours at the back and they did not 
have a problem.’

Sister Mary also hit the headlines in
2006 after travelling from Lincolnshire to the Cannes Film Festival to 
protest at the premiere of the movie The Da Vinci Code.

She claims to belong to Our Lady’s 
Community of Peace and Mercy in Lincoln. But the Roman Catholic Church 
has said Sister Mary is not ‘canonically recognised’ even if she does do
‘good works’. She is known to have spent three years with a closed 
Carmelite order in Cornwall, but decided to continue wearing a slightly 
modified habit despite no longer being a fully-fledged nun.

A spokesman for the Diocese of 
Nottingham, in which she lives, said she was now a ‘maverick’ and a 
‘one-woman order’. North Kesteven District Council will make a decision 
on the application following a consultation period which ends on July 
21.

The omens, however, do not look 
promising. Sister Mary’s planning application number is 666 – a number 
widely associated with the devil. A council spokesman said it was 
‘entirely coincidental’.

Da Vinci Code protest: Sister Michael made international headline when she protested against movie The Da Vinci Code by holding a 12 hour vigil with Gerard Fox, 31, infront of Lincoln Cathedral where scenes were shot

Sister Michael (left) protested about The Da Vinci Code which starred actor Tom Hanks (right at the film's world premier at the Cannes Film Festival) because she believed the story by Dan Brown to be heresy saying 'when I face almighty God at my final judgement, as we all will, I can say I did try my best. I did try my best to protest'
