A Michigan mother who allegedly gave her ten and 12-year-old sons marijuana for medical reasons has been charged with child abuse and faces up to six years in prison.

Amy Renee Cunningham, 31, from the village of Mesick, apparently indicated that she preferred using cannabis over prescribed pills for her children.

She reportedly gave the drug to her ten-year-old son to help with emotional issues and to his older brother to treat attention deficit disorder.

Wexford County Prosecutor Anthony Badovinac told MLive that the two children were allowed to take the marijuana by smoking it and started taking it in late March or early April.

Dr. Shawn Jayakar from St. John Hospital in Detroit says he would not recommend using cannabis for such behavioral problems.

'Actually, ADD is linked to the use of marijuana,' he told WWJ radio.

'So I definitely would not recommend anyone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to use marijuana, as it can make it worse, make it more difficult to concentrate, and makes you prone to further abuse of other drugs.'

Dr Jayakar also said giving children pot at such a young age can affect cognitive abilities if accumulated over a lifetime.

Cunningham reportedly came under police scrutiny after telling a Child Protective Services worker that she gave her children marijuana.

She attended a pretrial conference at the 84th District Court in Cadillac on Tuesday.

The mother is charged with delivery/manufacture of marijuana and two counts of third-degree child abuse. 

The drug charge is punishable by up to four years in prison and the child-abuse charge carries up to two years in prison or five years of probation.

The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Wednesday from Cunningham's lawyer.

Michigan voters approved marijuana use for some chronic medical conditions in 2008.

Under state guidelines, emotional issues and ADHD aren't qualifying conditions for medical marijuana use. 

Minors can get permission to use medical marijuana, but they must have a qualifying condition and meet other rules.

In a similar case, a Minnesota mother has been charged with child endangerment for giving her 15-year-old son cannabis oil to manage the pain of a traumatic brain injury. 

A medical marijuana law in the state doesn't take effect until July.
