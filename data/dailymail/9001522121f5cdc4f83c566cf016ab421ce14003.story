Former Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese is on the verge of a sensational career change, after being offered the chance to become a professional WWE wrestler.

Wiese retired from football after being  released by Hoffenheim in January, and has since focused on bodybuilding, leading to his extraordinary new physique.

The German, who  now weighs 115kg (18st 1lb), told Bild: ‘I got an official request from the WWE.

Wiese, on his Germany debut in 2008, looks on as John Terry contests a header for England 

‘It’s for a commitment from me to become a pro wrestler. I’ll listen to everything on it’s own merits.

‘Why should I say no? Wrestling is very popular especially in the United States. I will discuss the offer in the next few weeks with my agent.

‘I am not scared.’

Wiese, 32, earned eight caps for Germany between 2008 and 2012 and was part of their 2010 World Cup squad 

The goalkeeper made his Germany debut against England in November 2008, and played in the Champions League for Werder Bremen.

It has been suggested that Wiese would spend roughly a year training in Florida and could then become a lead WWE wrestler. 

The ex-Hoffenheim stopper follows in the footsteps of former Port Vale goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson, who retired from football in 2013 to try and become a professional wrestler.

Wiese could link up with wrestling legends like Dwayne Johnson, known in the WWE as 'The Rock'
