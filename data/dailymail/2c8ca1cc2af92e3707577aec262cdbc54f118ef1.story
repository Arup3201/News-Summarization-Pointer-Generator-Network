An Australian activist has been arrested by Malaysian police after protesting against a rare earth plant that has been accused by environmentalists of producing radioactive waste.

Activist Natalie Lowrey was arrested along with 15 other protestors from Malaysia on Sunday outside the plant owned by Australian mining company, Lynas Corp, in the eastern state of Pahang, SBS reported.

A police official told The Guardian, Lowrey could face up to two years in prison but at minimum she could be deported back to Australia.

The Australian remains hopeful that she will be deported, posting on Facebook: 'Thanks for the supportive messages :) I am going fine not sure when I will be deported but hope to see you soon xx.'

Following the arrest, Lowrey also posted one of the men had been badly hurt by police.

SBS reported the other protestors had been released and could face future charges.

But Lowrey was still in police custody for 'investigations', a district police official said. He did not offer anymore information.

The term rare earths refers to 18 metals that are used for industrial and hi-tech techniques, including creating smartphones, hybrid car batteries, wind turbines, steel and low-energy light bulbs.

Lynas Corp is trying to wrestle monopoly away from China who dominate the rare earths industry, with 95 per cent of the market's global production coming out of the country. It is also home to 23 per cent of global reserves of the metals.

Protestors were arrested when some infiltrated the police barricade during demonstrations, according to Malaysian anti-Lynas activist Tan Bun Teet.

They believe the plant is producing radioactive waste that is threatening the environment and the population.

Sydney-based Lowrey is awaiting a deportation date. She arrived last week for Sunday's demonstration.

In late 2012, Lynas began its operations outside Kuantan - Pahang's capital - in an industrial park after more than a year of delay because of strong opposition from the local people.

Since then, environmentalists have gathered at the Malaysian plant in a slew of protests.

The mining giant has been adamant the plant is safe, saying radioactive waste was minimal and would be disposed of safely.
