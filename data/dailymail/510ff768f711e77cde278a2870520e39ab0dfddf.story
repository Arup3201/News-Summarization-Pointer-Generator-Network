'Casino banker': John Hourican, head of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will step down over the Libor rate-rigging scandal

The top ‘casino banker’ at Royal Bank of Scotland is to step down over the Libor  rate-rigging scandal – and will be forced to return up to £7million in bonuses.

John Hourican, head of the bank’s investment arm, will quit at the end of the month in an attempt to satisfy demand from politicians and regulators for a senior scalp.

Mr Hourican, the state-backed lender’s most highly paid employee, will have to give up £4million in share options he was due to receive from previous years.

Sources at the bank indicated that it would dock up to £7million in total, as Mr Hourican will also forfeit his bonus for last year.

The figure has not yet been disclosed, but he received a £2.5million payout in 2011.

He will still receive a pay-off worth £700,000, however, as he retains his contractual entitlement to a year’s salary.

The news emerged as RBS braces itself to receive a fine of around £400million later today for rigging Libor interest rates.

That dwarfs the £290million fine issued to Barclays last summer.

Damning emails are expected to show that RBS traders bragged about rigging the Libor rate, which is used to set mortgage repayments for millions of customers and is linked to trillions of pounds of investments around the world. 

Although there is no evidence that Mr Hourican knew about the scandal, traders are understood to have brazenly rigged rates on his watch. The high flyer joined RBS in 1997 and became head of the investment banking arm in October 2008.

The manipulation of the Libor rate is 
alleged to have occurred between 2006 and 2010. Supporters of Mr 
Hourican point out that most of the wrong-doing occurred before he took 
the helm.

But he is already a controversial figure at the bank, having presided over thousands of jobs cuts as he wound down the investment arm.

Last year Mr Hourican cashed in £4.8million in share bonuses awarded to him in 2009, just months after RBS received a £45billion bailout from taxpayers. And in March 2010 he received a package worth £7.7million, including deferred share awards paid out in later years. 

In an attempt to appease public anger, George Osborne this week promised that RBS bankers – not taxpayers – would pay the Libor fine out of their bonuses.
