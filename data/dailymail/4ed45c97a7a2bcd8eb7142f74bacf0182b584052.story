An upstate New York school has cancelled its varsity football team's season following a hazing incident in which players rubbed their genitals into teammates' faces. 

Eldred Central School will forfeit the final game of the 2014 football season after officials were made aware on Monday of 'widespread and pervasive hazing among members of the football team'.

It comes less than three weeks after seven  football players in Sayreville were charged in connection with the hazing and sexual assault of four teammates.

Game over: Two Eldred High School football players attend practice in August last year. The school has cancelled the varsity team's season after players were involved in a hazing incident

Eldred School District Superintendent Robert Dufour declined to say if it was one of the victims who had come forward to report the incident.

He said  a probe was launched immediately which determined fully clothed football players had been pushing their genitals into the face of others and sitting on teammates' faces.

Mr Dufour says no one was harmed physically, but the acts 'were not harmless in intent.'

'The (school district's) investigation revealed that over a three-week period, members of the football team engaged in such inappropriate hazing acts commonly referred to as 'teabagging' as well as students sitting on each other's faces, and pushing their face into the other students "junk" while on school grounds,' Dufour wrote. 

Hazing by players on high school teams in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and Sayreville, New Jersey, resulted in their seasons being canceled. 

Seven Sayreville players are also facing criminal charges.
