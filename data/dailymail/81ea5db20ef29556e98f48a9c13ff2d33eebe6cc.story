Giant Asda stores are not the most inspiring of locations, especially on a Monday lunchtime.

In Manchester, retired couples and stressed-out mums with pushchairs are getting their groceries. The atmosphere is humdrum.

But up on the first floor, just next to the George clothing section, something extraordinary is happening.

Spitting images? The real Hodgkinson Family, left, and their replicas, right

A construction 12ft high stands at the top of the escalator. It looks like a cross between a photo booth and the futuristic transporter in Star Trek.

Alongside it, a gaggle of shoppers, excited Asda executives and nerds with computers gather in anticipation. They’re watching a tattooed man standing in the middle of the contraption holding his two-year-old son.

The geeks press buttons and a series of cameras rotate around the man. Twelve seconds later, he steps out.

What is happening? Well, this is the world’s first high-speed 3D full body scanner, which takes countless pictures of the person inside, then uses them to produce miniature ceramic figurines supposedly identical to the subject.

It sounds like a marvellous idea. After all, who wouldn’t love a model of themselves to brighten up a shelf? (Asda have dubbed them ‘shelfies’ rather than ‘selfies’ for this reason.) It certainly beats the Georgian milkmaids and carthorses that decorated my grandparents’ home when I was a boy.

Suddenly, the family portrait seems much more fun. Little statues of ourselves, our pets, our loved ones and friends could replace boring pictures.

Admittedly, they are a little pricey at £60 per person, but it seems reasonable to keep my two technology-obsessed sons happy.

We travel to the Manchester store to get ourselves immortalised in ceramic in this photobooth for the 21st century.

The boys — nine-year-old Henry and Arthur, 14 — take one look at the machine and pronounce it ‘cool!’ My wife Victoria, 50, and I are more reticent. After all, the effigies will be a permanent record of how we look.

Because of this, we seem to have both unconsciously smartened up a little: I’m in a suit, perfectly respectable for a dad of 46, while my wife is wearing fashionable heels and a skirt. The boys are in their usual jeans and T-shirts.

First to be scanned is Henry. He stands on the podium, and the machine whirs around him like something out of  Austin Powers for 12 seconds. Arthur follows enthusiastically.

Next it’s my turn. I step into the booth, suck in my stomach and get my pose right. Am I being horribly vain? Well, in any portrait you want to look good, and I’m aware that in this one it’ll be harder to hide my flaws than in a picture. And this model might be around for all eternity.

Finally, Victoria strikes a pose. The cameras move around and, suddenly, it’s all over. The Hodgkinsons’ futuristic family portrait is in the bag — but now we face an agonising week-long wait to see how it turned out.

The 3D scanners will be opening in ten Asda stores, the locations of which have not yet been revealed, in August (file picture)

So how does it all work? Four scanners, incorporating digital cameras, move over the body and produce 1,000 digital photographs. These help create a 3D image on a computer.

The cameras also take the subject’s measurements, like a robotic tailor. The data, including your vital statistics, is sent to Asda’s mini-me production plant in the North, where the models are created out of thin layers of ceramic material using 3D printers.

Each figure is built up very gradually from the feet upwards in tiny layers just 0.1mm thick, which can be made in as many as 16 million colours.

All this leads to the lifelike quality of the models.

A few days later we excitedly unpack our mini-me models — and fall about laughing.

It is unnerving to see yourself in miniature. I think mine, 8in tall, makes me look a bit pot-bellied, and a cross between

David Cameron and George Osborne - definitely not the idea.

Victoria wishes she’d had her hair done. And so does Arthur, who asks: ‘Why is my hair green?’ He’s got a point. It does, indeed, seem to have a green hue — I think the printer picked the wrong one of those 16 million colours.

Henry is so pleased he snatches his up and runs out of the house to show the neighbours.

While Henry might be thrilled with his model, they are not perfect. The scale is a bit wonky. Mini Henry and Arthur are both 7in tall, whereas in real life Arthur is taller. And the figures are delicate. Arthur’s hand breaks off and we have to superglue it back on.

The best thing is how the frowns, crows feet and worry lines on my face and — I’ll get in trouble for this — Victoria’s, have been ironed out. The adult models definitely look better than the real thing.

‘Apart from my hair, it’s quite flattering,’ smiles Victoria.

I love the shelfies and display them in pride of place on a shelf (where else?) in the kitchen. They are like little works of art. Now we can all become a modern masterpiece.

Technology firms have begun offering similar 3D mini-mes, but this is the first time they are available on the High Street. The 3D scanners will be opening in ten Asda stores, the locations of which have not yet been revealed, in August.

The press office suggests myriad uses for the figurines: athletes could pose with their medals or pregnant women with their bumps.

A soldier’s wife could keep one at home when her husband is away. Granny could have models of her grandchildren above the fireplace.

You could get yourself scanned at significant moments in your life, such as graduating from college, getting married or after winning a race. Maybe you could even dot them around the garden, a modern equivalent of the garden gnome.

But less honourable uses are also possible. They could get thrown across the room during heated rows. You could send one of your ex-lover to them in the post, smashed into fragments. Big brothers could use the figure of their little brother as target practice with a sling and stones.

Spiteful sisters could scrawl rude words on their sibling’s figure. Might they even become sophisticated voodoo dolls?

Whether they are used for good or evil, I think shelfies will be a huge success. They combine two human preoccupations: little folk and vanity.

The mini-mes are different from photos — especially  modern ones, often kept on computers and phones and never framed — in one  important sense. They are a physical memento you can touch and cherish.

In a funny way, this new technology is taking us back in time to an age of real things — actual belongings you can touch and appreciate.

And I’m sure these figurines will see some moralists accusing fans of vanity and self-obsession. ‘The cult of the mini-me!’ they will thunder. ‘First the selfie and now the shelfie! Where will it end?’

But there is something comical about the models that stops them feeling too narcissistic.

The mini-mes raise a smile whenever I see them now, sitting on the kitchen shelf, frozen in time, small but perfectly formed.
