Picture this: dapper looking gentlemen donning waistcoats, bow ties and impeccably groomed moustaches riding through town on classic motorcycles.

Add to the mix tailored suits, crisp shirts, monocles, and riding goggles plus genteel ladyfolk sporting elegant dresses and it may just sound like a scene from Mad Men.

However this isn't the 1900s, but The Distinguished Gentlemen's Ride, where participants dress up to the nines in the their finest vintage attire and coast around the roads on retro or custom bikes.

The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride took place across the world on September 28, and riders in Sydney enjoyed a warm and sunny spring day for the event

'Café Racers, Bobbers, Classics, Flat Trackers, Scramblers and quirky, undefinable two-wheeled machines' are all welcome at the ride according to The Distinguished Gentlemen's website. These dapper gentlemen took part in the Zurich ride

Men and women across the world donned their finest tailored suits and trimmed their moustaches for the ride, and these lucky participants had the backdrop of Sydney harbour behind them

Some little motorbike enthusiasts also took part in the ride in Sal Paulo, Brazil at the weekend

This gentleman from Taunton in Somerset, England, donned some very fancy glasses and a smoking pipe for the annual event

The annual event has one key aim, besides looking impeccable atop a stunning bike with a lovely dame or gent in the side car of a motorbike.

'Our focus is on gentlemen who are dealt a tough hand in life. In particular, we raise funds for research into prostate cancer as part of our mission to support men’s health,' The Distinguished Gentlemen's Ride's (DGR) website states.

'For one day a year ... thousands of Distinguished Gentleman (and genteel ladyfolk) in hundreds of cities worldwide press their cravats, starch their tweed and sit astride their classic-styled motorcycles to raise funds for prostate cancer research and awareness.

Jun Song took part in the ride all the way from Salt Lake City in Utah, USA

Romanian men in the city of Bucharest jumped on their favourite two-wheeled vehicles and donned their finest pinstripe suit jackets

Brazilians in Sao Paulo dressed up to the nines to take part in the ride that isn't just for a good cause, it's about people having a good time in even better clothing

In Syracuse, New York, riders had some impressive bikes and patritotic headwear on display during the ride

Dashing dames  in New York donned their best riding boots and formal ties to jump aboard their classic motorcycles

'It’s a day all about spreading merriment while raising awareness of a really important issue,' the DGR site also revealed.

For the past few years, the ride has grown to huge proportions worldwide and at the weekend it was held in over 50 countries.

Starting in 2012 with just 2,500 riders taking part across 64 cities, the ride has grew exponentially to more than 10,000 participants across over 100 cities in 2013.

And 2014 was even bigger, with the charity raising more than $1.6 million for prostate cancer across the globe.

In Salt Lake City a smaller group took part but still managed to raise funds and awareness about the disease

Tens of thousands of people took part in the event across 258 cities in 57 countries such as this gentleman in Nijmegen in the Netherlands

More than $1.6 million was raised by all those who took part and contributed to the cause in 2014

This year 258 rides were taken across 57 countries by tens of thousands of dapper gents and lovely ladies looking to raise much needed funds for prostate cancer research.

The ride was inspired by a man named Bruce who was unexpectedly struck down by prostate cancer. His passion is motorbikes, and in his story shared on the DGR.

The disease runs in his family, and Bruce even rode his bike to the doctor the day he received his devastating diagnosis.

Sydneysiders got to enjoy the spectacular city views including the Opera House during the event

Ronan Keating and Red Foo were out supporting the cause at the weekend

'Motorcycles are my therapy, so it made sense to ride my good old Trumpy to Perth the next week to get my results. Nothing like a ride after bad news, I always say,' he wrote.

Bruce shares his whole story in a touching and brutally honest post about his battle during and well after he had surgery to remove his prostate.

But the advice he gives at the end is the most crucial, and some he wants every gentleman to follow.

'So, lads, have you got balls? Prove it. Go get tested. Today.'
