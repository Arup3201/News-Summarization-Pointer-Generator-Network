Sir Alex Ferguson’s decision to retire understandably came as a shock to the Manchester United squad - but none took the news harder than Robin van Persie.

That is the opinion of Rio Ferdinand, who revealed it was patently evident that the Dutchman struggled to cope.

Ferguson had been a contributive factor in Van Persie moving to Old Trafford from Arsenal for £24million back in 2012.

The 31-year-old’s goals in his first season at the club were a major reason behind the Red Devils clawing the Premier League title back from Manchester City.

Ferdinand told MUTV: ‘It took the wind out of everyone's sails. 

'It gave us an extra push to go and win be successful in that last season.

‘Everyone was really appreciative for what he'd done for our careers.

'The person it hit more than anyone was Robin. He'd come the year before, tasted that success and wanted more.

‘Visually you could see it hit him harder than anyone else at the time.’

Van Persie struggled for form under David Moyes - whose name wasn't referenced in Ferdinand's interview - last season. 

There appeared to be lasting damage to the striker after Ferguson's announcement, and the Dutchman said last year: 'I had to gasp for breath and I shook my head. Had he really said what I thought he'd said?

'The room fell deathly quiet and then everyone became emotional. 

'Sir Alex then had a long talk with the squad. I found it a very special speech and felt privileged to have witnessed it.'

Ferdinand, who wasn't afforded the opportunity to say an elongated goodbye to the club he'd played for since 2002, also expressed regret at Louis van Gaal allowing Danny Welbeck to go to to Arsenal on deadline day.

'I was surprised [at the move],' he added. 'Gutted really. He's a local lad and has come through from the Under eights. For him to leave was a little bit disappointing. I don't think we've seen the best of Danny. He's still got a lot more in him.

'I hope the Arsenal manager gives him the chance to be that responsible front man he wants to be. I'm sure you'll see him flourish.'
