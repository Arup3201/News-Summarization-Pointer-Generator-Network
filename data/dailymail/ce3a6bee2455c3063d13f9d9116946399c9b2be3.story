The 'lenient' suspended sentence handed to a teacher convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old pupil at school and at home cannot be reviewed because of a legal loophole, it was revealed today.

Dozens complained when Stuart Kerner walked free yesterday  but because his sex offence is not within the Attorney General's unduly lenient sentence review scheme it cannot be changed.  

The religious education teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust after taking the girl's virginity  in a school store cupboard and later taking her home for sex  while his wife was out.

Kerner was spared jail for the offence but it emerged today that he has launched an appeal to overturn the conviction and clear his name.

But the judge who gave him an 18-month suspended sentence, Mrs Justice Joanna Greenberg, will be investigated after complaints over her comments in court when she said his victim 'groomed' him.

Spared jail: Teacher Stuart Kerner, pictured during the trial with his wife Katharine, had sex with a student and took her virginity but was given a suspended sentence after a judge said the girl 'groomed' him

If the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office believe there is a case to answer the judge, whose own website warns 'cross me at your peril,' could be censured, suspended or even sacked.  

Yesterday the Attorney General's Office (AGO) said that it would consider whether to refer Kerner's sentence to the Court of Appeal after receiving a number of complaints.

But today in an embarrassing climbdown an AGO spokesman said: 'After a number of complaints, we carefully considered whether Stuart Kerner's sentence could be referred to the Court of Appeal for being too low - as part of the 'unduly lenient sentence scheme'.

'Mr Kerner's crimes are not included in this scheme, meaning the law officers are unable to refer this.

'However, it's important that the public can challenge what they believe to be exceptionally low sentences. We have been looking at whether the scope of the current scheme is right.'

Probe: Judge Joanna Greenberg will be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office after she said Kerner was 'groomed' by the schoolgirl he abused

The 44-year-old was given only an 18-month suspended sentence after the judge indicated her sympathy for him.

However, his instructing solictor Gary Rubin today revealed that Kerner has launched an appeal to try and get the conviction overturned.

Mr Rubin said: 'What I can tell you at this stage, is that not only is he planning to appeal, we actually lodged the appeal with the Court of Appeal well before Christmas.

'It was the advice given to his legal advisors that he should lodge an appeal against conviction.'

'I lodged it within 14 days of his conviction.' 

Last night the officer of the Attorney General has now confirmed it is considering if the sentence handed down was too lenient - but in an embarrassing climbdown has now said it cannot review it.

This means that despite 22 complaints from the public Kerner's sentence cannot be changed.

The Attorney General's Office (AGO) tweeted last night: 'AGO have received complaints about Stuart Kerner sentence and will consider whether to refer to Court of Appeal under ULS (unduly lenient sentences) scheme.

'Stuart Kerner's sentence will be considered. Decision due by February 11.'

Judge Joanna Greenberg QC's suspended sentence and comments during the hearing have sparked controversy and complaints.

She told Kerner: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her. It was she who groomed you and you gave into temptation when you were vulnerable.' 

John Carr, a leading Government adviser on online child safety, described the judge's actions as bizarre.

'I haven't seen all the evidence the judge did but I doubt I will be alone in finding her remarks utterly baffling,' he said.

'How can a 44-year-old man be seduced by a minor who is in his care?'

Holly Dustin, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'Judge Greenberg's reported comments in sentencing Stuart Kerner are astonishing in that they literally blame the young victim for his actions.

'This case shows how such deeply held prejudicial attitudes permeate the criminal justice system at all levels and raises serious questions about the adequacy of judicial training on sexual violence.'

A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said: 'The office will now ask prosecutors to send us more information on this case, so that one of the law officers can decide whether the sentence should be referred to the Court of Appeal for review.'

Evidence Jurors were told how Kerner, pictured, took the pupil's virginity in the same week his wife Katharine  suffered a miscarriage but Judge Joanna Greenberg said he was 'emotionally vulnerable'

During his trial at Inner London Crown Court last month, Kerner claimed the girl had invented their relationship, taking the novel Fifty Shades of Grey as a model.

But the former vice-principal of Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust.

Jurors were told Kerner, who taught RE and ethics, took to carrying around a condom for use if the girl became 'too irresistible'. On the day in February 2012 that they first had sex they met in the store cupboard and barricaded it shut with a chair.

That October, Kerner arranged for the girl to come to his house and they had sex before he dropped her home. He was arrested three months later. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had told a teacher about their affair after her parents found sexually explicit material on her phone.

Interviewed by police, the girl, who is now 19, said: 'It felt special. But, I dunno, it wasn't really. And admitting that does kind of hurt.'

Judge Greenberg described the victim as intelligent and manipulative and said the jury had not judged her a reliable witness.

She said the girl had persuaded the school to give her free meals by falsely claiming her mother would not give her lunch money.

The teenager also claimed to have been in a car crash and wore bandages for weeks before teachers discovered she was lying.

When confronted, she allegedly said: 'That's what I do – I lie.'

The judge said Kerner had been in a position of 'emotional instability' when they first had sex because his wife had just had a miscarriage.

She added: 'The victim pursued you and had formed an attachment for you which was not something you had encouraged. Her friends described her, accurately in my view, as stalking you. There is no doubt that she was obsessed with you. An obsession that she had harboured for a long time.

'I saw no sign that you had encouraged [the victim] in any way. Were it not for her obsession with you, the offence would never have occurred.It's a tragedy that somebody like you committed offences of this nature and now fall to be sentenced.'

But she added: 'You are the responsible adult and it is up to you to show restraint.'

Affair: Kerner, outside court yesterday, had sex with the 16-year-old girl at his school in south-east London on a yoga mat and also at his family home when his wife was at work

Joanna Greenberg's profile for Charter Chambers describes her as 'formidable'

'Cross me at your peril,' warns the website of the judge who sentenced Stuart Kerner.

Joanna Greenberg's profile for Charter Chambers also says: 'She is a formidable advocate who brooks no interference from a judge or anyone else in her direct approach on behalf of her clients.'

The unmarried 64-year-old has been a barrister for more than 40 years. She was called to the Bar in 1972, became a QC in 1994 and was made a circuit judge last July.

She has forged something of a television career, appearing as prosecuting counsel in a murder case in a three-part BBC Television series, Trial By Jury, in 1996.

More recently she featured in a rape trial in a four-parter, The Verdict, again for the BBC.

But her real work is in the courtroom where she says she is 'often instructed in the more difficult and complex murder and sex cases which involve competing experts and their untested opinion'.

On the website she lists her interests as skiing, scuba diving and travelling. She studied at King's College, London, after attending Brondesbury and Kilburn High School in the capital.

Former pupils include the model Twiggy and Julie Covington, who sang the original version of Don't Cry for me Argentina.

Protesting his innocence, Kerner had said the girl was a pathological liar and fantasist who had followed him around 'like a bad smell'.

He claimed she had been able to describe his house accurately because she had seen pictures of it on his Apple iPad. And he said she knew what underwear he wore because he had once changed for a panto and left his clothes on view.

Edward Ellis, mitigating, said Kerner's relationship with his 'devoted' wife Katharine had become stronger. He said the teacher collapsed following his conviction by a majority of jurors and had considered suicide.

Kerner, from Aylesford in Kent, was cleared of other counts of sexual activity. He has been banned for life from working with children and will have to sign the sex offender register indefinitely. His teaching contract was terminated in October.

Another campaigner, Jan Macleod of the Women's Support Project, described his suspended sentence as shocking. 'What it says to me is that there's a real lack of understanding about the nature of grooming,' she added. 'Grooming is all about power dynamics.

'In any case, the teacher definitely has a responsibility to say 'No', no matter how eager the child is. The criminal justice system needs to look more at the impact of this kind of thing – it involves a huge breach of trust.'
