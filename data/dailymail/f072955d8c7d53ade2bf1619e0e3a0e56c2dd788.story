A mother-of-seven has lost 16 stone after she became wedged in a shower cubicle during a family caravan holiday.

At her heaviest Louise Watson, 33, weighed 27st and was warned by doctors that unless she stopped her nightly kebab takeaway habit her internal organs would be crushed under her own weight.

Once forced to wear size 30 clothing, she can now fit into size 12 outfits following an NHS-funded gastric bypass operation.

Louise Watson, 33, weighed 27st and was warned by doctors that unless she stopped her nightly kebab takeaway habit her internal organs would be crushed under her own weight. She lost 16st and is now 10st 10lb

Speaking about her motivation for losing weight, she said: 'The caravan holiday was the last straw. I'd been fine getting into the shower, but as I got out I became stuck. I couldn't move at all because of my size.

'I had to call to my husband Jamie to come and get me. It was mortifying. Later on the beach someone called out that I was a beached whale. I knew I had to do something about it.'

Mrs Watson, of Northampton, saw her weight steadily increase following the births of her children Michael, now 16, Evie, nine, Annabel, eight, twins Olivia and Eston, six, Ronnie, four, and Francesca, two.

The mother-of-seven piled on the pounds after giving birth to each of her children. She would have takeaways, such as kebabs, for dinner most nights

She said: 'With every pregnancy I put on weight, then I made a concerted effort to lose it, only to regain it and add an extra stone every time. 'Over time my weight just went up and up. I tried every diet imaginable - different branded programmes, focussing on particular types of food, using slimming milkshakes and tablets â€“ but nothing worked.

'After the children went to bed I would binge eat. I would order the biggest thing on the menu from a takeaway, followed by ice cream for dessert.

'I made sure the children ate properly but I wasn't anywhere near as careful when it came to myself. I was constantly giving myself excuses to overeat. If I reached a weight target in a week of fad dieting, I would reward myself with a fatty takeaway.

'It was a very vicious cycle and I became severely depressed. I barely left the house.'

Louise, pictured in Skegness, had gone on an English holiday because she couldn't face getting on a plane and having the embarrassment of getting stuck in a plane seat - but had a similar incident in the shower cubicle

Her pregnancy with Francesca was particularly harrowing. She had to spend weeks in hospital attached to special equipment. She said: 'The midwives had to order a special bed and mattress which passed health and safety standards for people my weight.

'I had to be induced into labour so they knew the equipment was ready. It was so embarrassing. I couldn't look the other expectant mothers in the eye. I felt guilty about getting such special treatment.'

A holiday to Skegness in September 2012, when she was around 27st, proved all too much. She said: 'I had gone on an English holiday because I couldn't face getting on a plane and having the embarrassment of getting stuck in a plane seat. I ended up with the embarrassment of getting stuck in a shower cubicle instead.

Louise, pictured, left, at her wedding day in May 2009, had to do a double-take at holiday photos of herself and was immediately inspired to lose weight after that

'I was aware of people looking at me. Someone on the beach someone shouted out I was a beached whale. I felt so sorry for my kids who had to deal with that.

'At several points my eldest son got hold of the camera. When I was bigger everyone knew not to take pictures of me because I hated my size. When I got home and saw the pictures he had taken I had to do a double-take.

'I didn't register that the person in the pictures was me - I looked so large and unhealthy.'

In February 2013 Mrs Watson had a gastric bypass at Luton and Dunstable Hospital. She said: 'I was challenged to lose five per cent of my body weight before I even got to the operating table to help my body prepare for the change. I was on a milk diet for four weeks.

Despite her substantial weight loss, Louise has been left with excess skin. She will need to wait another year before becoming eligible for corrective surgery

'It was horrible. I was incredibly sick, but in a month I lost around three stone. After the operation I was on liquids for a month before building up to more solid food.'

At her heaviest weight, Mrs Watson typically ate six custard cream biscuits with coffee followed by a fry-up for breakfast. She would snack on chocolate and crisps consistently throughout the day, often buying a McDonald's lunch.

While her children would receive healthy square meals in the evening, her default option was nearly always a kebab or Chinese takeaway.

Today she restricts herself to black coffee with half a slice of toast for breakfast, followed by yogurt with cheese and crackers for lunch and a dinner of fish or chicken with fresh vegetables. Snacks consist of handfuls of cashew or pistachio nuts, or fresh fruit.

Mrs Watson, an office administration assistant, now weighs 10st 10lb, to the delight of her supportive husband Jamie, 35. She said: 'My family are so proud of me. My eldest son is a bit embarrassed - I think he's worried that people will mistake me for his girlfriend while we're out and about.

'I've changed my look completely. I used to wear frumpy clothes but now I have a vintage retro look. I can walk past relatives and they don't recognise me. I have a real love of fashion now.'

Mrs Watson's amazing weight loss has left her with excess skin but she will have to wait another year before surgeons consider her suitable for corrective cosmetic surgery. She said: 'I have to wear binding underwear and three bras to have any shape to my body. I make sure I wear long-sleeve tops to disguise the excess skin on my arms. Other than that, it's just about bearable.

'It's changed my life around completely. I was very depressed and unsure of myself before I lost the weight. I'd only leave the house once a week to do the weekly food shop and even then I would get panic attacks because I was so anxious.

'Those days are behind me now. The surgery lifted that dark cloud from me. I feel as though I've been reborn.'
