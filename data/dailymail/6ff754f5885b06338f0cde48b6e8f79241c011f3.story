Victim: JonBenet Ramsey was found murdered in the basement of her home in 1996

A Colorado reporter has filed a lawsuit to have the indictment made against the parents of slain JonBenet Ramsey made public more than a decade after it was originally filed.

The 1996 murder of the 6-year-old beauty pageant contestant made headlines for years and the latest revelation in the saga was that one of the grand juries called in to examine the case originally felt that the girl's parents were in part responsible for her death.

Back in 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to indict the Ramseys on charges of child abuse resulting in death, a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison.

Sources, including members of the grand jury, told the Boulder Daily Camera in January that the District Attorney at the time, Alex Hunter, refused to sign the indictment vote without giving a public explanation.

Instead, the indictment remained sealed and Patsy and John Ramsey were never charged.

Now a local journalist and a press advocacy group have filed a lawsuit asserting that the indictment should be made public in the interest in government accountability.

'The plaintiffs believe... that the indictment is a criminal justice record that reflects official action by the grand jury, and accordingly that it is subject to mandatory disclosure upon request,' attorney Thomas Kelley wrote in the formal complaint, as reported in the Daily Camera.

Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed

'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008

The indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back-and-forth between the criminal justice system and the Ramseys.

No charges were ever actually filed against John or Patsy Ramsy, and the same goes for JonBenet's older brother Burke who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family's basement on December 26.

Mrs Ramsey died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and John has since remarried.

In
2008, following the testing of previously unknown DNA found on 
JonBenet's underwear, the Boulder District Attorney formally ruled out 
any connection between JonBenet's immediate family members and the 
murder.

A new District Attorney reopened the case in 2009, and it still remains open to this day.
