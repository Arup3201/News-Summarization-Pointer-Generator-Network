Former World Championship 400 metres silver medallist Nicola Sanders has announced her retirement from athletics.

The 32-year-old, whose finest achievement was taking world silver behind Great Britain team-mate Christine Ohuruogu in Osaka in 2007, has barely competed over the past two years because of injury.

She said on Twitter: "I've had a brilliant time during my athletics career through all the ups and downs but the time had come to hang up my spikes!"

Sanders finished just four hundredths of a second behind Ohuruogu in Osaka, but, while the latter has gone on to become a household name with an Olympic and a second world title, Sanders' progress was persistently hampered by fitness issues.

Nevertheless, her time from that final, 49.65 seconds, still ranks her fourth on the British all-time list.

The British star has not been able to compete in 2014 due to injuries and has called an end to her career

Sanders, who also won a host of relay medals, also holds the British indoor 400m record, setting her time of 50.02secs in winning European indoor gold in 2007 in Birmingham.

She missed out on London 2012 and has called time on her career having not competed at all this year.
