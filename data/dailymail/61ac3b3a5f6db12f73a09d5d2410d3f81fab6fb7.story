A male clubber was shot dead at a trendy New York night spot where NFL star Victor Cruz had been celebrating his birthday.

At least four shots were fired at the popular Juliet Supperclub night spot in Chelsea, New York where actor Ryan Phillippe and singer Estelle had also been partying.

Two men were hit by the gunshots fired from a 9mm handgun at around 2.20am with one of the men being fatally wounded.

Members of the New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs had been in the club, although it is not clear when they left, according to a police source.

Another source said the Giants wide receiver Cruz had been celebrating his 25th birthday and was inside the building when the shots were fired.

Brandon Albert and Jarrad Paige from the Chiefs and NBA stars John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Chris Duhon and Bronx native Kemba Walker were said to have been at the club on the same night.

It was not clear whether any of them had been there during the frightening incident.

It is thought around 300 clubbers were inside the venue when shots were fired early on Tuesday morning.

The man who was fatally wounded was identified as Artis Arthur, 43, of Brooklyn, who was shot in the torso.

Tracy Ryals, 28, of The Bronx, and Jonai Washington, 28, of Long Island, were also wounded during the incident, according to the New York Post.

The shooting at Juliet Supperclub comes just two months after a club promoter fatally stabbed another man outside the club's velvet ropes.

Manuel 'Manny Stax' Pinero, 41, was arrested for murdering Christopher Adames, 23.

Police are investigated how the gunman managed to smuggle a weapon into the venue, as the club normally insists in searching revellers before entry.
