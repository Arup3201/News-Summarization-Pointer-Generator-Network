Do you think spending your holiday flopped face-down in a bucket of Malibu-pineapple while snoozing beside the pool leaves you refreshed, replenished and ready to face the year of office politics looming ahead? Sorry, but you're wrong.

People who use holidays as a chance to catch up on 40 (or even 140) winks find it much trickier readjusting to real life after a vacation than those who go on energetic holidays.

Some 82 per cent of Brits find it difficult to get back into the swing of life when they return from holidays, and say that it takes them around four days to fully recover.

But many of those who go on active holidays say it takes them just one.

In fact, the best way to leave yourself feeling refreshed, replenished and ready to take on office politics until your next break is to spend annual leave doing something that gets your blood pumping, such as skiing, hiking, diving or swimming, according to research.

Holidaymakers who take lazy trips return feeling sleepy, and beach-goers also struggle thanks to over-indulging on exotic food and enjoying too many late nights in seafront bars.

Some 31 per cent admit they take longer to complete tasks at
 work in the days immediately after returning from a holiday, and a quarter have forgotten to do a job altogether.

More than one in five oversleep and another 17 per cent end up making mistakes. Almost one in ten miss important deadlines because their head is still in 'relax' mode, and a quarter of workers have even had a colleague or their manager comment on the time it takes them to get over the holiday blues.

Researchers
 found that six in ten blame their slow uptake on being stuck in the 
'holiday frame of mind', while 45 per cent say it takes them a while to 
get used to actually doing things again after spending their time 
relaxing.

More than two 
thirds come back from their break feeling sluggish, while 84 per cent 
have even returned feeling like they still need more time off.

Forty-five
 per cent of workers struggle so much after being away they even book 
extra time off so they have a few days before they need to return to 
work.

A cheeky one in four 
even admitted to calling in sick after returning from a holiday to get a
 few extra days to get back with it.

'Sitting on a beach or alongside a pool for hours on end sounds like the most relaxing way to spend a holiday, but you are more likely to get home feeling sluggish and lacking in energy'

But those who have spent their time away being active return feeling full of beans, with a fifth claiming to be on top of things within just one day.

And more than half of people who have gone on both types of holiday admit they return home more refreshed and less sluggish from a break which saw their days filled with some kind of activity.

Felix Rodel, director at UK and Ireland SWISS which commissioned the research, said: 'Sitting on a beach or alongside a pool for hours on end sounds like the most relaxing way to spend a holiday.

'But while you may feel like you are recharging your batteries, it seems that you are more likely to get home feeling sluggish and lacking in energy.

'Dozing in the sunshine and chilling out all day can have an effect on your body clock so although you come back from a holiday expecting to feel better for it, it can be a real struggle for a few days as your body gets used to your daily routine again.'
