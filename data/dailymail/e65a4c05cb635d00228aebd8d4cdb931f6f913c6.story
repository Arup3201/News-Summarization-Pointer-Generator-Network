Authorities in North Carolina say a registered sex offender ran a 
home child care as a front for a child porn production operation 
involving a Special Forces soldier and other adults.

Authorities say Bailey Joe Mills ran an unlicensed child care from his home as a front for a child porn production company

Harnett
 County investigators say Bailey Joe Mills ran the unlicensed child care
 from his home.

Mills has three felony convictions involving sexual 
activity with children and was charged in January with raping a 
13-year-old girl.

Authorities say there are at least 10 child victims.

Also
 arrested were Mills' wife, 34-year-old Elizabeth Holland Mills; 
29-year-old Sgt. 1st Class Jordan Everett Busse of Fort Bragg; 
20-year-old Rashawn Rodriguez Drake Jackson; and 50-year-old Tommy Wall.

Bailey
 Joe Mills' attorney, Mac Hunter, said he expected federal authorities 
would get involved.

Mills had three convictions on his record involving sexual contact with children.

In 1997 he was convicted for taking indecent liberties with a minor, he was convicted in 2000 for sexual assault of a child, and in 2011 he was convicted of felony indecent liberties with a child requiring him not to be around children under 13 unless an adult was present and requiring him to undergo psychological treatment and stay to a curfew.

Most recently, in January he was arrested for having sex with a 13-year-old girl.

Detective Brad Byrd told WRAL the evidence was 'very disturbing.'

'As I go through all the evidence, I see everything that's happened to these children,' he said. 'It's heartbreaking.'

It's believed Mills attracted young girls with his day care and mentoring program, then offered them money to have sex with men he found on social media.

His operation likely dates back to 2013 but was not uncovered until Mills was arrested in January.

Upon reviewing his cell phone and computer investigator's realized the scope of the case.

The other defendants could not immediately be 
reached for comment.

Mills is being held on $500,000 bond at the Harnett County Jail and is scheduled to make his first court appearance on July 28.
