Stocks slid on Wall Street Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average logged its biggest one-day drop of the year, as investors fretted about the potential for gridlock in Washington.

The Dow closed down 121.41 points to 12,811.32, bringing its two-day loss to 434 points. The Standard and Poor's 500 index fell 17.02 points to 1,377.51 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 41.71 to 2,895.58.

The Dow plunged 313 points Wednesday, its
fifth worst one-day drop following a U.S. presidential election. The 
biggest, in 2008, came in the midst of the financial crisis on the day 
after President Barack Obama won his first term.

The two-day slump came in the wake of Obama's re-election to a second term as investors turned their focus back to Europe's problems and the so-called fiscal cliff, a package of tax increases and government spending cuts in the U.S. that will occur unless Congress acts by Jan. 1.

Investors see it as a serious threat to the economic recovery.

'The thinking before the election was that it would remove some of the uncertainty, but it seems to have done the opposite,' said Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer at Biltmore Capital Advisors in Princeton, New Jersey.

Among the biggest fallers on Wall Street yesterday were banking shares, with JP Morgan, Citibank, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley suffering big setbacks.

Although New York state was a solid Democratic win in the election, the banks were big financial backers of Mitt Romney in the hope he might ease some of the onerous regulation imposed since the Great Panic of 2008 if he won.

The fear is that unless Congress and the White House can deal with the fiscal deadlock before January 1 then the automatic cuts would immediately trigger a recession potentially wiping as much as 2.5 per cent of output and leading to a sharp rise in the jobless rate.

Stocks are still up on the year, but well below the peak they reached in September.

That was when the Federal Reserve announced a third round of its bond-buying program, which is intended to hold down borrowing costs and encourage lending.

The S&P 500 is 6 per cent below its high close of the year, 1,465, which it reached on September 14. That was its highest level in nearly five years. It is still up 10 per cent for the year.

Investors may be tempted to sell appreciated stock before a possible increase in the capital gains tax at the end of the year, Mr Vernon said.

Tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush expire at the end of this year and the U.S. government wants to cut a $1trillion budget deficit.

'The mood of the market has certainly switched,' said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, as investors monitor developments on the fiscal cliff and wait for more clues about Obama's agenda.

Investors were encouraged by two reports on the U.S. economy that came out before the market opened. Stocks initially opened up across Wall Street encouraged by figures from the Labor Department which reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 355,000 - but fell as the morning progressed.

One reason for this could be despite the good news from the Labor Department, officials did caution that the figures were more than likely to be distorted by Superstorm Sandy rather than a possible sign of a healing job market

But despite the shaky start to trading on Wall Street, a separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to its lowest level in almost two years as exports rose to a record high.

The Dow climbed as much as 48 points in the morning but started to sink after the first hour of trading.

The Dow fell steadily throughout the rest of the day, and more steeply in the last hour of trading. The Dow gave up 73 points in the last 40 minutes, accounting for more than half the day's loss.

The Labor Department reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell 8,000 last week to 355,000, a possible sign that the job market is healing.

Officials cautioned that the figures were distorted by Superstorm Sandy.

There was also encouraging news from Europe, where leaders shocked markets a day earlier with a dire forecast for economic growth next year.

It has been shaky running for the U.S. markets since President Obama was re-elected

European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said financial market confidence 'has visibly improved' as the 17-country group that uses the euro struggles with its debt crisis.

But he said the outlook for the economy remains 'weak.'

Mr Draghi spoke after the bank's governing council left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75 per cent.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, on Wednesday slashed its outlook for growth for this year and 2013. The report helped set off a sharp decline in stocks in the U.S and Europe.

Spain's government said that it had met its financing needs for the year after raising the equivalent of $6.07billion in a series of bond auctions on Thursday.

Spain became the focal point of the European debt crisis earlier this year amid concern that it would struggle to refinance its debt at affordable rates.

More news came from Greece, another problematic country in the fight to sure up Europe's financial concerns.

Last night Greek MPs voted through the next round of austerity measures - including tax rises and pension cuts - by the narrowest of margins to secure its next bailout bonus, saving it from 'catastrophe' its Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said.
