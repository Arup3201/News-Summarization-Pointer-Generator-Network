A woman claiming to be a teacher was arrested after becoming drunk and slapping the backsides of cabin crew on an easyJet flight.

The 23-year-old woman and her partner were said to have become abusive while on the delayed flight from Faro, Portugal, to Southend on Saturday. 

According to other passengers the woman repeatedly said she was a school teacher while slapping the backsides of cabin crew as they passed, swearing loudly and abusing staff.

The pair were arrested for endangering the lives of fellow passengers after they were removed from the plane, which had been delayed for seven hours by technical problems.

The drunk woman from Harwich and a 42-year-old man from Redbridge, East London, were hauled off the plane as it touched down at Southend Airport at 7.30pm on Saturday and were later given police cautions.

A fellow passenger, who asked not to be named, said: 'Not only did we have to suffer a seven hour delay due to technical difficulties, but we had to endure two drunk passengers, who were loud, using abusive language and causing a disturbance to other passengers. 

'The woman kept repeating that she was a school teacher, which was quite unbelievable at the language she was using in front of my primary school age children.

'After numerous attempts by the cabin crew to quieten them down, they continued shouting, annoying passengers, slapping the cabin crew on their backsides as they passed the cabin.'

The passenger added: 'Many people on board had to complete witness statements. We sat on the runway at Southend and police boarded the plane and arrested the pair.'

A police spokeswoman said: 'Two people were arrested after landing at Southend Airport at 7.30pm on, January 3. 

'A 23-year-old woman from Harwich and a 42-year-old man from Redbridge were arrested on suspicion of endangering an aircraft.

'They later received cautions for using threatening or abusive words towards a member of the crew.'

A spokesperson for easyJet said: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY7362 flying from Faro to Southend was met by the police on arrival due to the disruptive behaviour of a passenger on board. The flight was previously delayed leaving Faro due to a technical fault with the aircraft.

'The safety and wellbeing of customers and crew is always our highest priority. We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused by the delay and disruptive passenger.

'easyJet does not tolerate any abusive or threatening behaviour on board and on the rare occasion an incident occurs, crew are trained to deal with the situation.'
