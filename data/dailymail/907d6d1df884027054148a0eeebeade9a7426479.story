Matthew Hudson-Smith is just 19 and had only run five 400 metre races this season before he took an astonishing 0.83 seconds off his personal best to become the quickest British athlete of 2014 over a lap of the track.

The teenager’s 44.97sec performance to finish third at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix was also the second fastest time by a European athlete this season. It was a quite extraordinary breakthrough for a runner who only moved up to the 400m this season and he was rendered wide-eyed and almost speechless by his achievement.

Hudson-Smith was only invited to take part in the prestigious Diamond League event five days before the race and ran blind from lane eight, yet finished with such a powerful surge on Saturday that there is surely more to come from this teenager.

Bright future: Matthew Hudson-Smith reacts after finishing third in the 400m at the Glasgow Grand Prix

1. Hudson-Smith is currently on a gap year, but plans to go to Worcester next year to study sports science.

2. His personal best of 44.97sec was the second quickest ever by a British teenager and ranks fifth of all time at Under 23 level.

3. The Birchfield Harrier dedicated Saturday’ssuccess to his coach, Tony Hadley, and his mum, and celebrated with a roast dinner at his nan’s.

4. Hudson-Smith won bronze medals in the 200m and 4x400m at the European JuniorChampionships last year, despite having run only one relay leg for his club before joining the British quartet.

5. He said he felt like ‘a jaguar being chased by a lion’ as he went under 45 seconds for the first time.

‘I surprised myself more than anything,’ he said. ‘I knew I would get to 300m fine but I seemed  to find a different gear so I just kept going.

‘It’s my first Diamond League event and I’ve set the bar pretty high. I’ve literally just moved  up from 200m. It was my sixth 400m of the year and it’s unbelievable.’

His coach, Tony Hadley, was not surprised. Hadley guided 1994 European 400m champion Du’aine Ladejo and world 4x400m champion Derek Redmond and knows a decent  one-lap runner when he sees one.

It was Hadley who looked after Jim Redmond’s camera when he fought his way on to the track to help injured son Derek complete  his 400m semi-final at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

Hudson-Smith won a European junior bronze medal over 200m last year, but turned heads in the 4x400m relay by running a 45.9sec split. He has since been selected to represent England in the relay at the Commonwealth Games, but now hopes to secure a place in the individual 400m at the European Championships when the selectors meet today.

He might be the quickest British man this season but he was disqualified in the heats of the British Championships after stepping out of his lane and will therefore be reliant on the selectors’ discretion.

‘He was very angry about what happened at the trials,’ said Hadley. ‘It was like he got all dressed up for the party and then someone said, “You can’t come in”.

Aiming high: Hudson-Smith is hoping to be selected for the European Championships after his recent displays

‘We knew he had a quick time in him because I hadn’t seen the times he was running in training since Ladejo and Redmond.

‘He didn’t really distribute his speed very well on Saturday and he left some energy in the tank that could have been used on the back straight.

‘So he can go very, very fast if he keeps on working hard.’
