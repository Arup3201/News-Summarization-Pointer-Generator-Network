The 'gutted' woman at the centre of a blackmail scandal has come out to defend her name after her former fiancé threatened to reveal graphic details of an alleged affair with England cricketer Eoin Morgan unless he was paid £35,000 ($70,000).

Brooke Tsakirakis's ex-partner, Nick Emery, said he would release 'sexually-based' messages and videos he found on his computer featuring the cricketer, 28, unless he was paid the money before the start of England's match today.

Now, a tearful Ms Tsakirakis said she is 'furious' that her life has been ruined because of a relationship she had five years ago and claims Emery unlawfully gained the information from her phone.

The emails were traced to safety consultant Nick Emery (above). He is pictured with Brooke Tsakirakis - who said she is 'gutted' and her life has been ruined because of a relationship she had five years ago

'I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry, but I’m gutted. I’m ropeable angry. I’m fur­ious, but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority,' the 36-year-old told The Mercury.

Ms Tsakirakis made it very clear that she is not in a relationship with Emery any more and he is well aware of the situation.  

Mr Emery, a safety consultant from Tasmania, said he had come across 'some interesting Skype calls' between his fiancée  and Morgan after Tsakirakis had backed up her phone on his computer. 

He told reporters: 'I have got a fair bit of interesting content regarding Eoin Morgan with a woman who isn't his girlfriend ... there's sexual content. It's my partner.' 

However, a 'furious' Ms Tsakirakis said Mr Emery hacked into a deactivated Facebook account she had at the time she met Mr Morgan.

'[At] no time [was] my phone uploaded or backed up on his computer. He unlawfully gained that information and he has admitted that to me,' she said.

Ms Tsakirakis went on to say that she was is more concerned about the effects the scandal is having on her two children aged 13 and eight. 

'I’m a true and honest person and I’ve always supported Nick through our relationship and tried to help him.' she said.

The England Cricket Board said it had received an email, demanding money be paid or details of Morgan's previous relationship, including videos, would be given to both the UK and Australian press

She said the controversial messages between her and Mr Morgan 'may have been romantic or sexually explicit' but claimed that they were not out of the ordinary for two consenting adults.

Ms Tsakirakis was astounded when two Cricket Australia officials visited the gym she works in to ask her questions about the blackmail scandal. She initially thought they were there to join the gym but soon realised they were looking for Emery.

'I was quietly embarrassed. They were quite supportive but they said they didn't want it to go any further and they had a deadline, the situation needed to be dealt with and they needed to talk to Nick and where was Nick?' she said. 

In one interview with the Australian press, Emery claimed he had found compromising messages between the pair from just last year. 

Speaking to the Melbourne-based Herald Sun newspaper, a distraught Ms Tsakirakis, 36, said: 'My life is ruined because of a relationship I had five years ago.'

The Tasmanian mother-of-two said she had no knowledge of Mr Emery's alleged blackmail attempt. 

'He's the one who tried to extort money, not me,' she said. 'I'm gutted.'

Ms Tsakirakis said she has now ended her relationship with her fiancé and the cricketer said his involvement in the blackmail plot has not distracted him from the job at hand.

The England captain, who has been dating Australian model and law student Tara Ridgway for the last three years, is understood to have had a relationship with Ms Tsakirakis five years ago while he was playing cricket in Australia.

On Wednesday, the England and Wales Cricket Board took the extraordinary step of releasing details of the plot amid fears that speculation surrounding the dalliance could disrupt the match.

The board also disputed Emery's claim that there was some kind of relationship between the pair last year, insisting that the relationship took place five years ago when both parties were single.

The blackmail plot emerged before Dublin-born Morgan led out his side against Australia. 

The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard of the blackmail plot after receiving two emails from Mr Emery. UK detectives then tracked him down within 24 hours with the help of colleagues in Australia.  

After meeting ECB officials and Australian police officers, he said he had made a mistake because he was in a 'bad head space'.

Emery's fiancée is Brooke Tsakirakis. She has spoken out following the blackmail plot and said she is 'gutted'

Speaking to the Herald Sun, he said: 'It's done. It's dealt with. I did the wrong thing in the wrong state of mind.

'I wanted to catch her out in a big way. I was in a very angry and bad head space. 

'Everything is sorted now. They were very understanding. We came to an agreement.' 

He said he had stumbled upon the messages when his partner backed up her phone on his computer. 

Emery added: 'It was a stupid mistake on her behalf. I knew something went on between them a long time ago.'

He said he had called Morgan's number to confirm it was the cricketer, but had not confronted either of them. 

The blackmailer gave no indication to his friends or family about what he was planning to do. Instead, he posted a picture of himself and Ms Tsakirakis smiling on his Facebook page last week.

Morgan is thought to have met his girlfriend during the 2010/11 Ashes series in Australia, which England went on to win 3-1

In October he wrote: 'This time one year ago I met this hottie for a coffee. 12 months on we still meet for coffee, every morning in the kitchen. She keeps me real, she believes in me and I love her loads.'

A month later he announced their engagement over Facebook. 

On Wednesday, Paul Downton, managing director of the ECB, said: 'There were references to a relationship that Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady. 

'It was a brief relationship and what appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB.

'The individual, who comes from Hobart, demanded that the money be paid before the first ball was played on Friday.

'The suspect has been identified as an Australian resident of Hobart who is the new boyfriend of the woman Morgan dated five years ago. 

'The individual is understood to have found a phone with details of Morgan's relationship.

'He has now apologised saying it was not intended to go this far.'

Mr Downton said the ECB would not be pressing charges against Mr Emery. Police declined to comment.

Morgan insists his involvement in the blackmail plot has not distracted him from the job at hand, despite being dismissed first ball in the Tri-Series defeat to Australia.

'It hasn't been distracting at all. I spoke with the ECB yesterday and I was very happy for them to deal with it,' he said.

'They told me just to focus on the cricket 100 per cent and I've done that.

'I was very comfortable with them looking after the situation.

'I'm happy it's all been cleared and everything is over and I can get on with my cricket, which I managed to do today.'

England lost by three wickets in a dramatic game against Australia.
