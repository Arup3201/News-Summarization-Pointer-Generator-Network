Gross negligence: A police officer has been jailed for blowing up a suspect's testicles with a stun grenade like this one when the victim refused to leave his car

Swedish police used stun grenades to subdue a mother who refused to hand over her five-month-old son.

The 30-year-old woman had armed herself with a knife when police entered her flat in Helsingborg, southern Sweden to aid social services with taking the child into care.

She locked herself in a room with the baby boy and, after several hours of negotiation police judged her a threat to the child and called for backup.

The incident took place earlier this 
month when social services in Helsingborg requested police presence when removing the child from the woman’s care.

The five-month-old boy is the third child to be taken from the woman, who has been in and out of employment for several years.

When
 social services ruled that her baby should also be taken into care she 
made serious threats to staff and refused to cooperate, and as a result,
 police were called in to help remove the child from her.

The
 initial police force had kicked a hole through the door to communicate 
with the distressed mother, but she refused to let go of her son.

When a squad team arrived at the scene, they decided to use stun grenades to subdue the woman.

The grenades, also known as flash grenades, go off at up to 180 decibels temporarily paralysing the person they are fired at.

The child was hospitalised and the woman was taken to a psychiatric clinic.

Her legal representative claims police used unnecessary force.

'It
 is very strange that police use stun grenades on a petite woman who 
just tried to defend her child.

'She judged the actions of the police to 
be unfair and feels she was facing an impossible power,’ lawyer Charlotte
 Lagersten told Dagens Nyheter.

When her two older children were taken 
from her, a psychiatrist noted that they both ‘seemed safe and well 
cared for’ and had a ‘warm and caring relationship’ with their mother.

When it was ruled that her new-born should also be removed from her care, a psychologist who met with them wrote that the boy showed ‘an attachment to his mother which is rare to see today.’

‘I am extremely critical to how the woman and her children have been treated,’ Ms Lagersten adds.

‘Social Services have chosen not to divulge any of the investigation or papers which have proven the woman’s ability to care for her children.

‘They have also completely disregarded the fact that the children at the time of going into care were physicially and mentally well.

‘In short, there are no legal grounds for taking them into care.’

The woman, who left psychiatric care on Thursda, has previously applied to have her other two children returned from foster care, but she has not been allowed to see them for 18 months.
