X Factor star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has joined fellow Geordie TV celebs Ant and Dec in questioning whether she can still vote Labour.

The pop superstar said it was 'hard' for her because all her friends and family supported the party - but said she already paid 'a f****** lot of tax' and needed to listen to what the other parties said.

Mrs Fernandez-Versini, who has built up an estimated £20million fortune, said she was now a mature woman  and felt a greater responsibility to be well-informed about politics.

It came after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked the Labour leader Ed Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him.

Other celebrities, including Myleene Klass, Angelina Jolie, Sol Campbell and Bill Oddie have also publicly criticised the Labour Party over the proposed Mansion Tax on expensive homes.

But the popular X Factor judge's remarks are likely to particularly sting because of her life-long support for the Labour Party.

David Cameron and George Osborne have also made tax cuts the centre of their pitch for re-election. The Tories want to clear the Government's £90billion deficit without any tax rises - while Labour has called for the rich to pay more.

Mr Miliband has pledged to restore the 50p tax rate on those who earn more than £150,000, introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million - dubbed the mansion tax - and raise the point at which high earners start paying 40 per cent of their income to the government.

Mrs Fernandez-Versini told the Telegraph's Stella magazine that she would 'listen' more carefully to other parties now that she paid so much in tax.

The 'Crazy Stupid Love' singer also suggested she could 'make my own party' adding that 'stranger things have happened'.

'It's hard for me, because all my friends and family vote Labour,' she said.

Asked if she would consider voting for David Cameron, she replied: 'Not really. I want to hear what everyone's got to say.

'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself. Now that I'm a mature woman.

'I feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country. And I pay a f****** lot of tax. So I think that I need to have a really well-informed, well-educated opinion.'

The X Factor darling has built up a fortune since her pop career took off after being voted onto the pop band Girls Aloud on the 2002 TV show, Popstars The Rivals.

Despite growing up on a council estate as one of five children in Newcastle, she now earns a reported £2million a year as a judge on X Factor and face of L'Oreal.

Last year, she married French playboy Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini - who owns pop-up bar Cosy Box in Cannes.

It came after she divorced England footballer Ashley Cole in 2010 citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’ after numerous allegations of cheating on his part.

Despite her wealth Mrs Fernandez-Versini said there were 'big downsides that come with having money'.

She said: 'As many as with not having money. I mean, they're different types of stresses, but they're both stresses.'

Mrs Fernandez-Versini later claimed on Twitter that her remarks had been taken out of context, adding: 'I am a labour supporter, but will always want to hear what everyone has to say.'

Her comments come after presenter Myleene Klass attacked Mr Miliband over the policy, claiming it would hit 'little grannies' whose homes had increased in value over decades, rather than the super rich.

Actress Angelina Jolie said she could be 'put off' from moving to Britain by the proposal, which would come in this year if Labour wins on May 7.

Mr Miliband was left bruised after And and Dec questioned whether he was up to be Prime Minister. 

Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'

His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband.

The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election.

According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29.

This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one.

Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent.

Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories.

Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government.

'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.'

Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'
