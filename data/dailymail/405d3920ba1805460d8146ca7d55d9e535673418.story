British holidaymakers seem to give up when it comes to trying to maintain newly-made friendships abroad.

Despite 58 per cent of respondents proudly divulging that they regularly make friends when away, a survey of 2,000 people  has found that over half of us (59 per cent) admitted to only contacting our new travel pals once after landing back in the UK.

One fifth of Brits (20 per cent) explained how their newly-formed friendships wouldn't last longer than 24 hours once they returned home, with only six per cent managing to maintain their new-found friendships for a month after their holiday.

It may be friendship bliss on holiday, but what are the chances of keeping in touch when you return home?

Lizann Peppard of Hotels.com, which conducted the research, said: 'Meeting new people when you are at your happiest and most relaxed is part of a great travel experience and being on holiday often bring out the best in all of us.

'It's good to know that so many of us enjoy this part of the trip, even though it can be a struggle to keep things going when we hit home turf.' 

Almost a quarter (22 per cent) confessed to giving out a fake phone number so their new associates wouldn't pester them, while a shocking 17 per cent admitted to handing out these false numbers on numerous occasions.

But it's not all doom and gloom, with a solid 38 per cent of UK residents going on holiday specifically looking to make new pals whilst they are away.

A slender but significant one per cent even ending up marrying their holiday buddy.

Londoners have come out on top as being the friendliest holidaymakers you can meet abroad with 83 per cent of the vote, followed by Wales with 64 per cent and the West Midlands in third position with 63 per cent.
