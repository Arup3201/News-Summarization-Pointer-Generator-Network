Cardiff City will discuss a proposed return to blue at a board meeting on Friday.

Owner Vincent Tan has been at the heart of Cardiff's controversial rebrand from blue to red in 2012, with the Malaysian businessman believing the colour would bring good fortune.

Tan told Sky Sports as recently as Christmas Day that 'Cardiff will stay red' and that he would take no notice of protests planned by supporters' groups against the re-branding and the threat of thousands of season tickets not being renewed.

However, Tan called a meeting at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday where club officials consulted a cross-section of fans.

Tan was not present but chairman Mehmet Dalman said: 'It was great, a very balanced and very professional meeting, 

'It was time to bridge the gap with our supporters. I think Vincent will give this a great deal of consideration.

'It's very clear what came out of the meeting. There was a strong feeling that the club should return to blue, but there was also an understanding that Vincent likes red and that should be respected.

'He [Tan] will listen and he will consider. Vincent Tan saved the club when it needed saving. He will never leave this club in the lurch,' Dalman added. 'This was a very good evening for Cardiff City.'

Around 70 people were in attendance and speakers included fans, councillors, MPs and business leaders.

Fans unanimously voted for a blue home kit and the return of a prominent bluebird badge. They were also happy to accept a red away kit.

CEO Ken Choo said the respect shown to Tan at the meeting could be a significant factor in any decision to revert to blue and Dalman suggested the inclusion of a red dragon on any new Bluebird badge would be a respectful gesture to the owner.

Cardiff supporters' groups hailed the positive atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium meeting and welcomed the possibility that the club's traditional colours could soon be restored.

Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Hartley said: 'We were really glad that Mehmet called the meeting and there was a great cross-section of people there, representing not just the fans and their representatives but also the business community in Cardiff, a sponsor, an MP and a councillor.

'It was a unanimous vote - and Mehmet called for the vote - on the blue and everyone said we need to return to blue to bring back unity to this club.

'We are hoping that the board meeting will actually decide to tell Vincent Tan that, "We've had an experiment, you tried it and it didn't work".

'There's unanimity to go back to blue for the benefit of this club.

'The business case is there, the community case is there and we will say, "The supporters will follow you and we will be united behind the club if you return to blue with the bluebird on the crest".'

Sian Branson, of supporters' group Bluebirds Unite, said: 'I think we can show Vincent Tan how great we can be as fans and how great this football club can be.

'They asked me, "What do you think the atmosphere would be if we want back to blue?" I said: "You won't see a party like it in this city."

'We'll have a march and I'll walk up the front of that march with a banner saying: "Thank you Vincent Tan" if we go back to blue.

'We've still got to wait but I'm positive.'

Vince Alm, of the Cardiff City Supporters' Club, thanked Tan for listening to the views of fans.

'We want to be united and pushing forward and we feel going back to blue is the best way of getting fans back in the ground,' Alm said.

'We're very respectful of the investment we've had off Vincent Tan but we talk about spirit and we want to show the passion of Welsh people as one.'
