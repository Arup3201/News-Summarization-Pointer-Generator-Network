It reads like a shopping list of a super-rich international playboy, from yachts, classic cars and jewellery to luxury homes in Knightsbridge, Dubai and Spain.

But the £22million catalogue of riches have been seized by prosecutors this year from some of Britain’s biggest drug dealers, fraudsters and tax cheats.

Investigators working around the globe have vowed to pursue criminals even after they have been caught and convicted, insisting they will ensure ‘crime does not pay’. 

Details of assets seized from criminals include a property in Knightsbridge (right) in which tax fraudster Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh (left) had a £1million stake

Dosanjh also handed over a Rolls Royce Phantom, like the one pictured, as part of £11.4million recovered to date 

Martin Evans was ordered to repay £4.8million for several offences including theft, deception and running a firm while bankrupt. Prosecutors sold his V50 yacht, similar to the one pictured, for £330,000 to raise £1.8million to date

The Crown Prosecution Service has released details of the vehicles, houses and property taken from just seven criminals which it is claimed could be used to fuel more crime.

They include high-end properties worth millions of pounds in Knightsbridge and Chelsea, two of London’s most expensive districts, as well as Kent, Marbella in Spain and a flat on the 49th floor of Dubai’s landmark Torch building.

The rogue’s gallery of criminals have also lost a Rolls Royce Phantom, a V50 yacht and £2,500 Tiffany necklace.

Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, told MailOnline: ‘It’s simply not right that criminals should be allowed to benefit from their illegal lifestyles so CPS prosecutors up and down the country in our new Proceeds of Crime Service are working flat out, with police colleagues, to deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.’

The largest amount seized on the list was from tax fraudster Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, who was convicted in June 2012 of using carbon credit VAT rules to con HMRC out of £39million.

Millions were transferred out of the UK to accounts in Switzerland and then around the world to Singapore, Cyprus and UAE.

Sentenced to 13 years in prison on appeal, an order was made last year to seize £2.9million plus another £10million in hidden assets.

London drug baron Redwan El Ghaidouni was ordered to hand over more than £400,000 in 2012 after being convicted of trying to smuggle drugs into the UK. The CPS seized and sold his flat on the 49th floor of the Torch building in Dubai’s Marina to raise the money

The total recovered to date is now £11,414,440, including a Rolls Royce Phantom and a property in Knightsbridge in which Dosanjh had more than £1million in equity.

British national David John Downes, who lived mainly in Spain, was jailed for 4 years and 7 months last year for his role in a major ‘boiler room fraud’ in which worthless shares were sold to unwitting investors using high pressure sales techniques.

The shares were sold over the telephone to the UK based investors by ‘cold calling’ by plausible sounding salesmen who were based abroad, with the money placed in bank accounts in the US, Canada, Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland.

To date he has had more than £4million seized including land in Spain and properties in Marbella.

Money launderer Tarek Meghrabi was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in 2012 for crimes worth more than £8million.

Ordered to pay £2.3million, prosecutors took ‘robust action’ and seized and sold a property in Chelsea worth £2.2million and a Tiffany necklace which sold at auction this year for £2,500.

With additional payments of £30,114 in May this year, the total reclaimed to date is £2.2million.

Martin Evans was jailed for four years in prison in 2006 for offences including being a bankrupt in charge of a company, trading with intent to defraud a creditor and five counts of theft.

Ordered to pay back £4.8million, so fare £1.8million has been confiscated so fare.

It includes £948,998 that was located and seized in Switzerland in September this year and just over £330,000 raised from the proceeds of selling a luxury V50 yacht.

Melvin Jestin was ordered to pay £627,500 after his 2011 conviction for conspiracy to supply cannabis.

After years of Jestin trying to delay making the payments, he eventually sold his Tudor-style six-bedroom house in two acres of land in a village in Kent in March this year and has now paid £759,033, including interest.

Fraudster David John Downes, jailed for 4 years and 7 months last year for his role in a major ‘boiler room fraud’, had properties in Marbella seized as part of £4million taken by the CPS

Money launderer Tarek Meghrabi was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in 2012 for crimes worth more than £8million. Ordered to pay £2.3million, prosecutors took ‘robust action’ and seized and sold a property in Chelsea worth £2.2million (left) and a Tiffany necklace  for £2,500

Assets seized by the Crown Prosecution Service includes:

Drug gang leader Daniel Redmond was sentenced to 9 and a half years for a plot to import cannabis resin into the country.

Ordered to hand over £3million by Snaresbrook Crown Court, to date prosecutors have seized £1.5million including cash seized in Spain and enforced against the order in May this year.

London drug baron Redwan El Ghaidouni was ordered to hand over more than £400,000 in 2012 after being convicted of trying to smuggle drugs into the UK.

The CPS seized and sold his flat on the 49th floor of the Torch building in Dubai’s Marina, raising the £money he was required to pay in the first successful British confiscation order in the United Arab Emirates.

Ms Saunders added: “The examples highlighted today by MailOnline are a very powerful demonstration of the message that crime does not pay.

‘It’s particularly unpalatable at this time of year, when many law abiding people are feeling the pinch, to think of organised criminals capitalising on the misery of drugs and fraud and revelling in extravagant UK properties and overseas holiday homes.

‘So I’m delighted that we’ve taken these assets back, often to the benefit of British tax payers.’

Prosecutors can now take tougher action in more countries than ever before, she added.

‘The proceeds of crime - the cars, the cash, the houses - are often laundered and used to fuel more crime. They are the lifeblood of organised criminals but we are the means of constricting that blood flow.

‘Organised crime works across borders and so must we. That’s why we’ve sent CPS prosecutors to Spain and Dubai, and have plans to send others to the Caribbean and South Africa, to work with international partners to thwart the attempts of criminals to hide their assets.’
