Police say the toddler was running around covered in feces.

Responding officers went to the house of the boy’s parents and found them asleep in a back bedroom.

'They weren't watching the child at all,' Detective Shane Safrit told WSOC.

The little boy has been taken away by the Department of Social Services and later released into the custody of another family member.
