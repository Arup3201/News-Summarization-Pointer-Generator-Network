A new pay-TV service is launched today in the biggest challenge yet to the dominance of Sky.

For
a one-off payment of £49 and as little as £4 a month, YouView gives 
access to the 70-plus Freeview TV channels with the ability to ‘pause 
and rewind’ live television.

The
YouView box can also record and store 300 hours of programmes and lets 
you watch the previous week’s TV using BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, 4oD and 
Demand 5.

YouView is a joint venture between the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.

The
basic service, with a set-top box thrown in, costs £49 if installed by 
BT and TalkTalk, plus a monthly fee starting at £4. In contrast, the 
cheapest Sky+ package costs more than £250 a year.

Although
YouView boxes have been on sale since the summer for around £250, the 
new deal for BT and TalkTalk customers has brought the price right down 
and brings in extra services.

BT intends to be a major player, purchasing the 
broadcast right for 38 Premier League games with BBC sports presenter 
Jake Humphrey, pictured, to front their sports channel

BT 
is giving away millions of YouView boxes to broadband customers. The 
firm says the box is free, but there is a one-off £49 activation charge 
and a £6.95 delivery fee.

TalkTalk is matching this offer for its broadband customers.

BT intends to be a major pay-TV 
player following the purchase of the broadcast rights for 38 live 
Premier League football games, including the opening match of the 
season, from 2013 to 2016.

BBC
sports presenter Jake Humphrey has been hired to front the coverage on a
new BT sports channel. It has also snatched live broadcast rights for 
four years to show Aviva Premiership Rugby.

The
BT Vision service sells pay-TV packages including Sky’s sports and 
movie services plus pay-on-demand access to blockbuster films.

The cheapest BT Vision package costs £4 a month, while an enhanced package comes in at £12.50 a month. 

By
comparison, the cheapest Sky entertainment package costs £21.50 a 
month. All YouView customers need to pay a monthly broadband line rental
to access the services.

At present, around ten million homes subscribe to Rupert Murdoch’s Sky channels and 11million have Freeview boxes.

But
YouView intends to become a major player, having launched a £10million 
marketing campaign featuring Gary Barlow and Benedict Cumberbatch.

Lord
Sugar, the firm’s chairman, said: ‘The simple–to-use YouView box allows
people to search back an entire week to catch what they’ve missed and 
also combines on-demand services with TV channels, providing 
extraordinary TV for everyone.’ 

Chief
executive Richard Halton said: ‘YouView has undergone successful trials
in thousands of homes across the country and we are excited about 
entering the next stage of the journey.’

The key to YouView is to combining traditional broadcast TV and online TV services into one box.

The on screen programme guide lets viewers scroll back into the past and watch shows from broadcasters catchup services.

The vast online archives of iPlayer, 4OD and others can also easily be accessed without leaving the sofa.

As part of the launch, Joanna Lumley re-created famous TV moments, such as Basil Fawlty snapping at his car in the classic Fawlty Towers

The last two years have seen the rise of the smartphone and tablet as second TVs in many homes, with some even abandoning traditional TVs altogether.

Most phones and laptops can easily be hooked up to a TV to view the content on the big screen.

iPhone and iPad owners can even wirelessly 'beam' programmes to their TV using a £99 Apple TV box.

Android phones also have the capability 
to play most catch-up content, particularly from the BBC and ITV Player,
and many phones come with HDMI-out to allow you to hook your phone to 
your television.

Smart (but expensive) televisions also usually offer the full gamut of catch-up services, as well as YouTube.

Another route is via a games console - bot Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360 can access most of the major services.
