A mobile phone charger said to be the world's smallest aims to save users in a pinch when their battery is dying.

The key-ring size Fuel Micro Charger provides 20 to 30 minutes of extra talk time, or up to a few hours on standby.

To use the Fuel, users just turn on the power switch, and plug it into their phone, which will begin charging immediately.

Tiny but powerful: The key-ring size Fuel Micro Charger provides 20 to 30 minutes of extra talk time, or up to a few hours on standby

According to its Massachusetts-based creators Devotec Industries, it's ‘perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home.’

Measuring 1.3 inches by 0.9 inches by 0.5 inches, creators say they believe the device is the world's smallest cellphone charger, which can fit into your pocket or even hang off your mobile.

The Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep its charge for at least one month before needing to be recharged.

Inner workings: Most of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery

The device is powered up from the supplied cable or any AC micro-USB wall plug. To use, you turn on the power switch and plug into your phone, the same way you would with an ordinary charger. 

Devotec Industries spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger.

The components are the smallest available, and they have used features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as possible.

The body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish.

The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours.

This should provide around 20–30 minutes extra talk time, or a few hours on standby. 

Compatibility: The Micro-USB is the standard charging connector for all phones apart from the iPhone, and charges with most Android, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, Nokia or Blackberry phones

On the outside of the case, are three LEDs. These tell you if the Fuel is turned on, fully charged, or charging.

Each of the Three LEDs will light up to tell you different information about your Micro Charger – red means charging, green is fully charged and blue tells you that the power is on.

The world’s smallest blood monitoring implant was built by scientists at scientists at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. The 14mm device can show if and when a heart attack has occurred.

Using Bluetooth, the device can then transmit the data to a smartphone  for tracking. The device can also track levels of glucose, lactate, and ATP, providing valuable data for physiologic monitoring during activity, or in possible disease conditions like diabetes.

The world's smallest guitar -- carved out of crystalline silicon and no larger than a single cell was made at Cornell University to demonstrate a new technology that could have a variety of uses in fibre optics, displays, sensors and electronics.

The ‘nanoguitar’ -- made for fun to illustrate the technology was just one of several structures that Cornell researchers believe are the world's smallest silicon mechanical devices.
