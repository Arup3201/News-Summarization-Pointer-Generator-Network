The terror suspect who was shot dead by a policeman was on top of a second officer, stabbing him in the chest and face when he was gunned down, an inquest into his death has heard. 

Numan Haider, 18, was killed with a single shot to the head after pulling a knife from his jacket and attacking the officers outside Endeavour Hills police station in suburban Melbourne on September 23.

The officers - one from Victoria Police and the other from the Australian Federal Police - had arranged to meet with Haider over his recently cancelled Australian passport when he launched his attack, the Victorian Coroners Court heard on Friday.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Jessica Wilby, said Haider struck without warning as the officers approached him and asked him to remove his hand from his jacket so they could search him in the car park of a nearby childcare centre.

He stabbed the Victoria Police officer in the arm and the AFP officer in the chest and face, Ms Wilby said.

He was on top of the AFP officer continuing his attack when the Victoria Police officer shouted for him to drop his weapon before opening fire, the inquest was told.

Ms Wilby said Haider was still clasping the knife in his hand after being shot dead.

The directions hearing marked the beginning of the coronial investigation 10 days after Haider - a known extremist - attacked the officers on the night of September 23.

Coroner John Olle described the case as extremely sensitive, saying it had attracted significant comment and attention.

'It's important to remember there are three Victorian families directly involved in this incident,' he said.

The officer investigating the shooting, Acting Sergeant Neil Smith, also told the brief hearing toxicology reports on the two officers and Haider were pending. CCTV footage and around 75 witness statements would be collected as part of the investigation.

Some members of Haider's family were in court on Friday. The matter will return to court at a date to be fixed.
