The Premier League has announced that next season's competition will begin on August 8.

The Barclays Premier League season will be followed by the European Championship, and the Premier League's move could allow England manager Roy Hodgson additional time to prepare his side, should they qualify for the tournament.

In a short Twitter posting, the Premier League stated: 'The 2015/16 BPL season will kick off on Saturday 8 August'.

Next season's Premier League campaign will start on August 8

The Premier League announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday

The move could allow Roy Hodgson more time to prepare his squad for Euro 2016, if England qualify

The season will finish early in the calendar due to the scheduling of the Euros and Champions League final.

The FA Cup third round will be the first fixture to be played next year due to how the 2016 calendar falls resulting in less congestion during the holiday period.

The date for the final day of the season has yet to be announced.

It will not be the earliest start to a Premier League campaign, with that remaining the August 7 opening day of the 1999-2000 season.
