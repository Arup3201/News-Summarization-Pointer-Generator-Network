His father's turbulent time as Prime Minister doesn't appear to have discouraged Euan Blair from seeking a career in politics.

According to The People Tony Blair's 28-year-old eldest child is keen to follow in his father's famous footsteps by standing as a Labour MP.

A family friend said: 'Euan has been thinking about a career in politics for some time. Cherie is particularly pleased. She likes the idea of a Kennedy-style Blair dynasty.'

Friends have said Euan is eager to improve his Labour credibility by taking up a public sector post and he is believed to have left his job with investment bank Morgan Stanley.

According to Labour MP Tom Watson the young Blair has shown commitment to the cause by knocking on doors in previous by-elections and is a 'genuine Labour activist'.

A spokesman for Tony Blair's office said: 'The Blairs will support their
 children in whatever they decide to
 do, but the idea that either of them is interested in a dynasty is pure
 invention.'

Earlier this month Euan had to walk past
 anti-war campaigners as he joined his father at a Labour Party 
fund-raiser with Ed Miliband.

The rally at The Emirates Stadium in London marked Tony Blair's return to mainstream politics.

Mr Blair wants to get back into the profession after picking up Â£20million last year through public speaking and advising banks and foreign governments.

It is not the first time Euan has hit the headlines, 12 years ago he was arrested by police when he was found vomiting on the pavement in London as he celebrated his GCSE results.

The news broke just days after Tony Blair had announced that he wanted to introduce spot fines for anti-social behaviour.

After completing his degree in ancient history at Bristol University Euan worked as an intern in the U.S. for Democrat and also Republican politicians.
