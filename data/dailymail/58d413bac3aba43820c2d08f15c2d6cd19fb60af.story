She subtly slammed Bill Cosby over his history of rape allegations on an episode of 30 Rock back in 2009.

But this was not the first time Tina Fey took on the comedian, as she called him out for allegedly drugging and molesting a woman during a Saturday Night Live segment nine years ago.

The actress co-anchored 'Weekend Update' with Amy Poehler and reported that Cosby can't be held responsible  as he was suffering from 'the brain damage', trying out her best impression.

They then joked that resident Cosby impersonator Kenan Thompson was too scared to comment because he wanted to continue to work in show business.

The joke was aired the week that Tamara Green went on NBC's Today Show to accuse Cosby of rape.

During the mock news report, Ms Fey said: 'A California lawyer alleged Wednesday that thirty years ago, Bill Cosby drugged her and tried to molest her, and after she fought back, he dropped two hundred-dollar bills on a table and fled.

'Cosby says he can't be held responsible for his actions, since at the time he was suffering from, "the brain damage".'

When Ms Poehler asked if Mr Thompson would be coming out as Cosby to defend himself, Ms Fey continued her impression, saying, 'No, Kenan is not coming out because of the 'Fat Albert,' and the money, and the sequels.'

'Of course he can't talk about the boobies, and the groping, and the pudding pops,' Ms Poehler added.

When Mr Thompson did come on the set, as himself, he said, 'Wow, thanks for that. Great job, you guys. I didn't say any of that, because Kenan Thompson loves to work, OK? Peace.'

Four years later, Emmy Award-winning show 30 Rock, which is produced by Ms Fey and  Lorne Michaels, made a scathing reference to Cosby's alleged history of assaulting women.  

In a clip from season three 'The Bubble', Alec Baldwin's NBC executive character Jack Donaghy tries to get actor Tracy Jordan, played by Tracy Morgan, to come back to work at fictional television show TGS.

He does this by hiring a Cosby impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone.

But the plan backfires when Jordan hears Cosby's voice, and reveals he has some bad family history with the The Cosby Show star. 

The comedian used to be known as a moral pillar, an image he crafted through  years of playing an upright dad on The Cosby Show. That's changed now  20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape

Tina Fey: A California lawyer alleged Wednesday that thirty years ago, Bill Cosby drugged her and tried to molest her, and after she fought back, he dropped two hundred-dollar bills on a table and fled. Cosby says he can't be held responsible for his actions, since at the time he was suffering from, (imitating Bill Cosby) 'the brain damage'.

Amy Poehler: That's funny. Is Kenan coming out to imitate Bill Cosby now?

Tina Fey: (still as Bill Cosby) No, Kenan is not coming out because of the 'Fat Albert,' and the money, and the sequels!

Amy Poehler: (also as Bill Cosby) Of course he can't talk about the boobies, and the groping, and the pudding pops.

Tina Fey: Because it would upset Mr. Cosby, and his wife, Camiiillle.

(Kenan Thompson walks in and stands behind Tina and Amy)

Kenan Thompson: Wow, thanks for that. Great job, you guys. I didn't say any of that, because Kenan Thompson loves to work, OK? Peace. (walks off; some applause)

Tina Fey: Wow, Kenan Thompson loves to work, everybody.

Amy Poehler: Loves to work? Who doesn't? 

'Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin' on the phone wit' me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette.' Jordan yells down the line. 

'I think you're confusing me with someone else,' the baffled impersonator replies.

'1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!' Jordan responds. 

The impersonator finds himself at a lack of words, saying: 'I'm the guy… with the pudding…' 

Comedian Hannibal Buress has been widely credited with the resurfacing rape allegations made against Cosby in a stand-up routine that went viral in October this year.

He unleashed a violent tirade against the 77-year-old stand-up, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a performance.

Not a Cosby fan: Alec Baldwin's character's plan to get Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan, right) back to work backfires when Jordan reveals an aunt's traumatizing run-in with Cosby in 1971

Mr Burress has history with Ms Fey as he spent a stretch back in 2010 as a writer on 30 Rock. 

It is not surprising that Fey knew about the rape allegations as she grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania near Temple University, where they first became public.

A former university employee Andrea Constand accused the star of fondling her in 2004.

The case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later, since authorities said they didn't have enough evidence to charge Cosby. 

Instead, Ms Constand filed a civil suit in March of that year, and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing Cosby's pattern of disturbing behavior. 

The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006.

Ms Fey has not commented on the scandal.
