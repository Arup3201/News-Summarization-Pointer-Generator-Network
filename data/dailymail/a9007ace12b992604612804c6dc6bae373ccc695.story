A former soldier is suing a hospital in Romania after he went to have a kidney operation and ended up having his penis amputated.

Costica Maroleanu, 55, had gone to the County Hospital in the town of Buzau in eastern Romania suffering from kidney failure.

Although the operation, carried out by surgeon Dr Iurie Ciochina, was successful, a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly, causing Mr Maroleanu's genitalia to become severely infected and leaving doctors with no option but to remove the penis in order to save his life.

Victim: Costica Maroleanu, 55, had gone to the County Hospital in the town of Buzau in eastern Romania suffering from kidney failure but an incorrectly-fitted catheter left his penis severely infected

Speaking of the botched catheter fitting, Mr Maroleanu said: 'After the operation they told me there were some complications. Apparently the nurse had not properly fitted a small plastic pipe to help me urinate, and my penis became red and infected.

'I was moved to intensive care and four days later was moved to the nephrology department where they took a sample, but then they just left me there for 10 days. Eventually they did an operation, but then doctor went on holiday.'

Shortly afterwards Mr Maroleanu was transferred to the Bucharest Military Hospital.

There he underwent a series of examinations with doctors concluding that the only thing they could do was to amputate the infected penis, otherwise there was a strong possibility he would die.

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'The foreskin was stripped away completely and most of the cells in the organ were dead. 

'The member was black and the only remaining skin was at the base of the shaft and highly infectious. It was recommended to remove the necrotic elements, meaning amputation.'

Surgeon: Although the operation, carried out by Dr Iurie Ciochina (pictured), was successful, a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly, causing Mr Maroleanu's genitalia to become severely infected

Speaking of this shock after the operation, Mr Maroleanu said: 'It was totally cut off. Now I urinate through an orifice that doctors made between my anus and my testicles.

'I urinate just like a woman. I'm devastated.'

Now the former soldier is demanding £362,450 compensation from the original hospital for malpractice.

He said: 'If they hadn't botched things up at the beginning this wouldn't have happened.'

But Professor Nicolae Calomfirescu, head of Romania's Sexual Medicine Association said: 'I'm not sure he will win by saying he is devastated and has to go to the toilet like a woman.

'It depends on the patient's image of himself. If you cut my right hand with me being a surgeon, I will be devastated. If you cut the left hand of a violinist, he will be devastated,' he said.

'But should he be devastated by the loss of his penis? I would say the man needs to be evaluated by a psychologist,' he added.
