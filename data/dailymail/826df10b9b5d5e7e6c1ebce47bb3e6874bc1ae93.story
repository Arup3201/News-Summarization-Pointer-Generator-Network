These are the brightly coloured rainbow snails which are already facing extinction, despite having only just been discovered.

Each unique to mountains in Thailand, the carnivorous creatures live in rock crevices, feeding on tinier snails, insect larvae and some earthworms species.

But these beautiful animals are now at risk from extinction as their limestone habitat is destroyed by humans.

They are at risk from extinction as their limestone habitat is destroyed by humans

They are among three new species from the genus Perrottetia, discovered in north and northeastern Thailand.

The
 species show extraordinary endemism, meaning they are unique to a 
geographical area.

Researchers say this 'one hill one species' is a very peculiar phenomenon. Each one of these snails is specific and the only one inhabiting a certain mountain range.

Limestone ecosystems in the world are
 now diminishing at an alarming rate as they are quarried for the stone, meaning areas like Thailand are losing 
biodiversity resources.

Teams from Chulalongkorn 
University, Bangkok and the Natural History Museum, London, have 
published research on the brightly coloured molluscs, from the genus 
Perrottetia.

'The three new Perrottetia species exhibit 
distinct morphological characteristics, which make for a great example 
for evolutionary studies in unstable environments.

'More than 50 per cent of limestone ecosystems in this
 region have been or still are being destroyed.

'This astonishing case of
 biodiversity persistence gives a valuable reason to put effort in the 
conservation of this important world ecosystem.'
