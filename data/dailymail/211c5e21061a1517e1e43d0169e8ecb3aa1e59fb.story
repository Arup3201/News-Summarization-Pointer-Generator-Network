Swirling colours, mesmerising clouds of glitter and dust, and bright splashes of liquid - a hypnotic new video could be the latest installation in an art gallery.

In fact, the short film - dubbed The Experimenter - captures the moment when Lush bath products hit the water to dissolve and disperse into stunning shapes and shades.

The makers behind the video were inspired by David Attenborough documentaries in which the camera zooms in on natural wonders to highlight fascinating natural detail.

The Experimenter is an artistic video capturing the moments that Lush beauty products are dropped in water

Many department stores and companies have made festive ad campaigns this year, and Lush bosses explained the reasoning behind their seasonal film.

'After the ominous scenes of Black Friday and the emotional hijacking of corporate Christmas adverts we simply want to show the world a colourful, liberating piece of artistic creativity.'

The footage of exploding bath bombs, swirling liquids and glitter was filmed by award-winning visual effects studio The Mill.

The Experimenter begins with the statement that the advert was: 'Made using fresh, handmade products and ingredients. Nothing is tested on animals.'

The visually stunning film was inspired by bath art posted on social media under the hashtag #lushtime

Lush said the campaign was inspired by  posts from their fans who had shared their bath art images on social media under the hashtag #lushtime.

A behind-the-scenes video of the film shows the  team experimenting with different product and colour combinations and assessing how the products react to water. 

The visuals are set to an original atmospheric score, Wings At Their Feet, played by a 45-piece orchestra and choral ensemble.

A hallmark of the  company is its use of bright colours in their, ethically-produced handmade cosmetics

The film evokes a nature documentary, in which  features of the natural world are shown in extreme close-up

Simon Richmond, who composed the piece, said: ‘We thought, why are we even thinking about Christmas at all? Why isn’t this more about all the amazing movements and energies that are in every Lush product?

‘You have this idea about what Lush products are, but wait a minute, there’s all this detail. There’s this hidden world. 

'It’s a bit like a David Attenborough documentary where you look at a rainforest and you think, “Yeah, yeah big leaves, all green,” and then the camera zooms in and you see these bizarre creatures doing the most unexpected things. 

'It kind of feels like the music reflects that, using these beautiful, rich, organic tones.' 

Lush is particularly vocal about products being cruelty-free and has pledged to fight testing on animals

This looks like a cloud against a clear blue sky, in fact it's a product sinking and dispersing in a tank of water 

Lush's digital managing director, Jack Constantine said: 'This piece of art is a beautiful illustration of experimentation delving into the process behind our product invention. 

'The collaboration between musical, cosmetic and visual artists has been a challenging creative journey with a rewarding result.'

Lush was founded in 1994 and the company is particularly vocal in its support of the fight against animal testing something which its says is the 'core value of our company'.

This product, containing glitter shot against a black backdrop, could be a  galaxy of stars in deep space
