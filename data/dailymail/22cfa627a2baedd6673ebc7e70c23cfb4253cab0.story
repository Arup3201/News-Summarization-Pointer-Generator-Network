Fiddling with tiny padlocks and trying to remember combinations could be a thing of the past for travellers.

A new digital lock has been launched, allowing tourists to lock and unlock their suitcase with a swipe of their iPhone.

The eGeeTouch lock, from US company Digipas, claims to offer a hassle-free alternative to normal locks and keys, offering increased security because you will need a specific smartphone or tablet to use it.

You can now open your luggage lock with your smartphone, removing the need to remember combinations

The eGeeTouch uses NFC, a feature found on most smartphones, to open and close the mechanism

The lock is battery operated which will last for three years, but it can also be charged via USB, and uses NFC (Near Field Communications) to operate; a feature that is compatible with most smartphones.

However, the product also comes with a pre-paired fob and sticker that is specific to that particular combination - working in a similar way to a lock and key.

It was decided to use NFC technology as, unlike Bluetooth, there is no pairing code to input.

The package also includes a pre-paired fob should your phone not have NFC enabled

The eGeeTouch Smart Lock will be able to be purchased in a variety of colours and designs

The company's website states: 'The world's-first eGeeTouch Smart Luggage Lock elevates your travel experience offering hassle free and improved security of luggage to accommodate increasing highly mobile worldwide travelers. 

'This smart lock is embedded with state-of-art intelligent proximity access security technology to effectively eradicate disadvantages associated with traditional keyed and combination padlocks.

The new Smart Lock will provide relief to passengers who are prone to losing keys

'The Smart Luggage Lock is innovated for incredibly ease-of-use plus high security protection offering hassle-free and peace of mind experience to the frequent travelers and holiday makers which the traditional luggage locks are unable to match.'

The design has also been recognised in the Tech for Better World category at the 2015 CES Innovation awards.

'We are truly honored and privileged to be named a winner of the prestigious CES Innovation Awards which, to us, is a significant endorsement and validation of our leading-edge innovation and products,' said Dr Jim Li, inventor & group CEO for Digipas.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Digipas to establish the projected guide price of the Smart Lock. 

In the worst-case scenario, and you haven't charged your batteries up however, there is a mechanical key that can be used to open the lock. 

So maybe it's not time for the lock key to make a permanent exit just yet.
