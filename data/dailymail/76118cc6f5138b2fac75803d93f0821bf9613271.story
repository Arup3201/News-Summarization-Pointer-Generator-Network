Eugenie Bouchard was back on the practice courts after recording a comfortable straight-sets victory over Alize Cornet on Monday.

The win means Bouchard, who is playing in only her sixth Grand Slam main draw, is just one match away from a third consecutive Grand Slam semi-final.

The 20-year-old Canadian wore a pink vest wearing the slogan ‘One Hot Drop Shot’ as she practised ahead of her quarter-final match against the winner of Maria Sharapova vs Angelique Kerber.

handle it out there. I think I was able to step up on the important 
moments.
