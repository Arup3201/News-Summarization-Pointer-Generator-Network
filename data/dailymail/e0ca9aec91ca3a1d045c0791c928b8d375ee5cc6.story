A Greek man bit off more than he could chew after he rescued an abandoned bear cub from the side of the road which destroyed the boot of his car.

Aggelos Markopoulos, 43, spotted the small bear on a street in Kastoria, a city in northern Greece in the region of West Macedonia.

Mr Markopoulos, who was driving to work, called officials who agreed it was unlikely the mother was in the area.

Mr Aggelos believed the cub's mother had been run over and decided to take it to an animal rescue shelter.

He said: 'When I found it, it was filthy dirty and after talking to the animal shelter we agreed it was probably best that I bring it there.

'It was making a hell of a racket in the back, I guess it was terrified and was calling for its mum.

When Mr Markopoulos opened the boot he discovered the bear had ripped up the covers in the car

'When I opened the boot and pulled it out, I saw it had torn out the light covers and ripped the covers.

'But it's an old car anyway so I wasn't too worried - these things happen and I'm glad the cub could be saved.'

Staff at the sanctuary said that after drying and feeding the cub it was in good health.

They are now attempting to find out if it is possible to locate the mother and reunite the pair.

The area is located on the western shore of Lake Orestiada in a valley surrounded by limestone mountains.
