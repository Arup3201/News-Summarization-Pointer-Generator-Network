Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson came to the rescue of an injured motorcyclist after a crash on a Las Vegas motorway last week.

Attorney Stephen Stubbs said his client, 29-year-old Ryan Chesley, was on his bike when a taxi cut him up, causing him to crash.

Stubbs said Chesley was lying on the ground when he looked up and saw Tyson, who was shouting at people not to touch him in case they inflicted further injuries.

The motorcyclist took picture of Tyson on his phone before the former boxer vanished from the scene 'like some kind of superhero' when paramedics arrived.

Tyson's assistant, Steve Lott, said Tyson received a handwritten thank-you note and a fruit basket from Chesley on Friday.

The motorcyclist broke bones and tore ligaments but has been released from the hospital.

In his prime, American boxer Mike Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
