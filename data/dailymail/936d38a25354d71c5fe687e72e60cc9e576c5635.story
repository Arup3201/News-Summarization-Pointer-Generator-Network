Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party regularly organised violent street raids where members on motorbikes would hunt immigrants with sticks, ex-members have revealed.

The party practice of 'assault militias' would see Golden Dawn supporters ride in pairs on motorcycles, brandishing sticks, and striking 'all the Pakistanis they could see', according to a report.

The evidence of the extreme right-wing party's culture of racial violence came to light mere days after the leader of Golden Dawn was arrested on charges of forming a criminal organisation.

In a court testimony published yesterday, one former Golden Dawn supporter spoke of 'military style' training of party members and of the 'assault militias' as a regular occurrence.

‘I took part several times in activities involving 50 or 60 motorbikes, with two people on each.

'The one who was sitting behind held a stick with the Greek flag and hit all the Pakistanis he could see,’ the ex-member said in court testimony.

Testimonies from two former members, 
along with a report by an examining magistrate revealed a series of 
‘criminal acts’ by the party, including voluntary homicide and attempted homicide.

The report revealed party members are 
trained in military style and had allegedly committed dozens of criminal
acts, including voluntary homicide and attempted homicide.

Last week, police arrested the controversial party's leader Nikos Michaloliakos and five other Golden Dawn MPs, including party spokesman Ilias Kassidiaris, amid high tensions following the murder of a left-wing rapper by a Golden Dawn supporter.

Described as ‘a neo-Nazi party with a history of violence which makes Nick Griffin look like Julie Andrews,’ by New Statesman writer Alex Andreou, Golden Dawn began systemised attacks as early as 1987.

They initially targeted immigrants, before turning against Greek-born nationals who disagreed with the party's extreme-right opinions, the report said.

Golden Dawn, Chrissi Avgi in Greek, has a ‘strictly hierarchical structure, the leader is all-powerful following the principle used by Hitler,’ deputy prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Charalambos Vourliotis, said in the report.

Police on Monday continued their raids on Golden Dawn premises, searching for hidden arms supplies.

Last week's arrests were the result of some of the about 35 arrest warrants for Golden Dawn members have been issued, Greek police said.

Police said the counterterrorism unit was investigating the party in connection with the murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fissas, 34, by a 45-year-old Golden Dawn member.

Mr Fissas, who appeared under stage name Killah P, was stabbed to death in the Athens district of Keratsini on September 17, sparking violent anti-fascist protests across Greece.
