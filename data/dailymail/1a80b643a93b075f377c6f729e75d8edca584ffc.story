Students at a Staten Island, New York, high school have been battling against a strict new dress code by blatantly flouting the rules and railing against the policy on social media. 

Officials at Tottenville High School sparked an uproar among tudents by adopting the 'Dress for Success' policy in time for the fall semester.

The highly restrictive code covers everything from tank tops and short-shorts to hoodies and sunglasses.

Other
 banned articles of clothing include low cut blouses, halter and midriff
 tops, low riders, muscle tees, short shorts, short skirts, wallet 
chains, metal spike bracelets and metal spike necklaces, WABC reports.

Also out are headbands, hats, bandanas, hoodies, sunglasses, do-rags, earlplugs, headphones, and visible undergarments.

Many female students have accused the school administration of sexism, 
claiming that most of the rules apply almost exclusively to female attire.

In response to the dress code, teens took to Twitter to air their grievances against their school and rally their peers to protest against the draconian measures by dressing deliberately provocatively. 

‘These students are rebelling to the point of basically wearing undergarments,’ one father told the New York Post. 

The
 students' sartorial acts of defiance resulted in some 200 teens, 90 per
 cent of them female, being sent to detention last week.

According
 to students and parents, school officials have been pulling kids from 
hallways for wearing clothes deemed inappropriate and handing girls grey
 Tottenville T-shirts and gym shorts to cover up until a parent could 
bring them something more wholesome to change into.

The Tottenville student body also has been very active on Twitter this past two weeks, firing off messages condemning their school for ostensibly restricting their freedom of expression.

‘I didn’t go to public school to be told how ‘I’m allowed’ to express myself … I can respect myself 150% and still wear shorts and a tank top,’ a girl named Katelyn wrote on Twitter. ‘Maybe instead of worrying about what I’m wearing, you should worry about the fact that I’m going to graduate high school with next to no life skills whatsoever.’

Another rebellious teen wrote: 'when the principal pays for my clothes then he can tell me what to wear...'

While some parents have voiced their disapproval for the dress code, others have come to the principal's defense.

One mother told CBS New York that some girls at the school have been wearing clothes more fit for strippers than for high schoolers.

Department 
of Education spokeswoman Marge Feinberg said it is the first year the dress code was 
implemented.

District
 31 Superintendent Aimee Horowitz told the New York Post that skimpy 
clothing is banned because it 'interferes with the learning and teaching
 process.'

Students Alexandra Gliaos and John Caccese say the dress code goes too far in some cases

Principal Joseph Scarmato, whose daughter also attends Tottenville, met with parents before the start of the school year and had them sign off on a handbook outlining the dress code and the disciplinary measures for violating the rules, Syracuse.com reported.

Under the new guidelines, first-time rule-breakers will earn a trip to the dean's office along with a hour-hour detention.

Scarmato explained that the policy is necessary to prepare students for college and the workforce.

But students think the policy goes too far.

'They're cracking down a little too much for a school that was used to doing whatever they want,' senior Alexandra Gliaos told reporters.

'Kids were getting yelled at and they were telling them they had to put shirts on from the gym,' she added. 

Some students are still wearing the outlawed clothing to school in protest.

'The cheerleader outfit, it breaks the dress code,' student Jonathan Giardino told WABC. 'It's too short and goes past the relaxed line.

'If their parents let them out wearing it, there's no reason the school should be telling them not to wear it. If they care that much then get us uniforms.'
