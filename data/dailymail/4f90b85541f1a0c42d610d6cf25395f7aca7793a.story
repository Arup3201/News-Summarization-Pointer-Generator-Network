The UK's shopping spree is set to continue today as experts predict Cyber Monday will see consumers spend another £650 million online within 24 hours.

Following the chaos and flashes of violence that marred Black Friday, today's event is based around online purchases although many stores are still offering bargains.

Internet shopping figures consistently peak on the first Monday in December, thought to be a combination of the last payday before Christmas falling on the previous Friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying from home. 

Below are the best deals according to Femail's experts: 

 

1. IS THE SITE GENUINE?

It should include the retailer’s name, address and email address. Check for a tiny padlock or unbroken key symbol before the web address, and be sure the address begins with https:// (the ‘s’ is for ‘secure’). Genuine firms won’t feature the names of popular items or cheap prices in their web address.

2. RESEARCH STORES

If you’ve spotted a gift from a relatively unknown company, Google it and see what comes up. Check internet consumer forums. When browsing for goods, don’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results.

3. PAY BY CREDIT CARD

For goods costing £100-plus, a credit card gives more protection than a debit card, prepaid card or PayPal. If an order goes astray, the goods break or the firm goes bust, you can claim from the card provider. Never pay by cash transfer.

4. SPEND £50 ON ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION

From ‘phishing’ emails to spyware, fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts, so get an up-to-date firewall from the likes of Norton or McAfee for £20 to £50. 

 5. PASSWORDS SHOULD NOT BE TOO PERSONAL

Avoid obvious names or dates, and try not to use the same password for all sites. To create a complex password, use a mnemonic: for example, pick a song, the year it came out, and stick a £ sign at the end. You can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you’re visiting.

6. SWITCH OFF OR LOG OUT

Turn off a PC if you’re not using it, especially after a browsing session (a favourite time for hackers). If a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one-off purchase, go for the latter.

 7. USE A STORE’S APP

If you’re buying gifts and using your smartphone, do it on the retailer’s app rather than using the main website. A dedicated app, if available, offers greater software protection than a web browser, especially if you’re in a public place.

8. IF YOU’RE STILL NERVOUS

Choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person. High Street names including Waterstones, Argos and PC World now offer this.
