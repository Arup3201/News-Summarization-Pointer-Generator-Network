A British volunteer has died on an Indonesian island, just days after revealing on Facebook that he had caught a life-threatening tropical disease.

Richard Cann, 24, was working with the Orangutan Health Project on the western Indonesian island of Sumatra.

He told his friends on Thursday, September 18, that he had caught Dengue-fever, a potentially life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitoes. 

He wrote on Facebook that he had been working in 45 degree Celsius heat with 'no doctors' and 'no air con'.

On Monday, Mr Cann, from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following a seizure.

The project assistant flew out to south-east Asia in April this year to help protect the endangered primate on the island of Sumatra.

He wrote on Facebook: 'Have had Dengue fever this last week. Slept solidly for the last four to five days and now feeling on the mend, but maybe next week will be 100 per cent.

'Sitting in 45C heat with no doctors and no air con, doping up on painkillers, hot water for the joints and a cat for cuddles.

'Nothing as dramatic as haemorrhagic fever. Should be fine next week. I'm made of tougher stuff.'

It is unclear whether his death was linked to his fever. His parents, Kate and Chris, have flown out to the island following the devastating news.

Richard was a member of the Royal Southern Yacht Club, based in Hamble, near Southampton, Hants, where he had been a junior cadet.

Rear Commodore Sailing Karen Henderson-Williams released a statement informing members of the sad news.

She wrote: 'It is with great sadness that I write to inform you of the the death of Richard Cann on Monday 23rd September, aged 24 years.

'Richard was a Splasher, Junior Cadet and later an Academy Member.

'Richard was on a work placement in North Sumatra when he suddenly suffered from a seizure.

'The Flag Officers and Club Members send their deepest condolences to his parents Kate and Chris, and also his brother James (Academy Member).

Mr Cann was an avid supporter of the Orangutan Health Project and regularly posted messages encouraging people to check it out

'We will notify all members of the funeral arrangements when the Club is made aware.'

Mr Cann was an avid supporter of the Orangutan Health Project and regularly posted messages encouraging people to check it out. He highlighted his important role in the charity's efforts to protect the endangered primate.

In one post in July, he said: 'So I'm in charge of making a presentation.

'Not just any presentation, but one that's going to be presented to the International Primate Conference by my boss next Friday on a specific parasite... no pressure then.'

A month later, he wrote: 'Reading scientific papers and making a presentation while sipping rum, feel like I'm back in uni.'

The Orangutan Health Project, which is based in the Sumatran rainforest, claims to be the only on-going orangutan health research project being conducted in the world at this time.
