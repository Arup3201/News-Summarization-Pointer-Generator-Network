Strewn with filthy sleeping bags, burnt-out beer cans, clothes and shoes, this is the scene left behind as the last migrants move out of an illegal camp in Calais.

What was once a sports hall for factory workers resembles a rubbish dump, with mattresses, cardboard boxes and tents all abandoned.

The detritus has been left by the 2,000-strong group of migrants who have been sleeping rough on the site for more than a year as they try to reach Britain.

They were given until yesterday to vacate their illegal camp – dubbed the Jungle – or face arrest. 

Many have simply upped sticks and moved half a mile along the coast to a new camp, much to the horror of local residents.

The port’s outspoken mayor has already blamed Britain’s benefits system for attracting the migrants, thousands of whom have massed in Calais waiting for an opportunity to sneak into lorries, cars or caravans and enter Britain.

And last night, the deputy mayor said he was working to have border checks moved from the town back to England.

Philippe Mignonet said: ‘I speak to a lot of the migrants, and when I see them, I wish them good luck – I tell them I hope they succeed. They have a dream.

‘I am fed up every morning to see the news, that it is Calais’ problem, that we are responsible. 

'The English are hypocrites, their destination is not Calais, it’s England. 

'The answer is to move the border back to England.’ 

He added: ‘Why is David Cameron not coming to Calais? Why? I know he is a busy man but I am sure someone in his government has told him many times what is happening here.’

Yesterday, a handful of migrants yet to leave were gathering their few belongings and walking to their new home. 

French police sources said they would use force to remove any remaining on the site today.

It is going to cost thousands of pounds to clean the tents and rubbish from the site, which was once a sports hall for factory workers

It will cost thousands of pounds to clean the area.

Tifa Hussan, a 28-year-old computer graduate from Sudan, had been living at the site since December. ‘The police told us about a month ago that we all had to move to the new camp,’ he said.

‘Most people left within the last week, but I am going to stay. This is my home. I don’t want to move. They can beat me. I am not afraid of them. I want to go England and find a job.

‘It is a good place. I have friends who have gone there and I want to join them.’ 

The new, official camp provides beds, showers, toilets, a laundry service and medical facilities for migrant women.

Dubbed the ‘new Sangatte’, it will offer legal advice for migrants wishing to apply for asylum in the UK and will cost about £6million a year to run.

Half of the bill will be paid using a £3million ‘special’ grant from the EU which would include money from UK taxpayers.

The other half is paid by the French government. 

Men are not allowed to stay, but can use the facilities during the day. Many have set up their tents in the sand dunes nearby. 

The new camp is a few minutes walk from the main road, where migrants jump on lorries bound for the UK.

The original Sangatte was used by an estimated 60,000 migrants as a springboard for illegal entry into the UK. 

After it was bulldozed in 2002, migrants built various makeshift camps in the town including the Jungle, where a British journalism student was raped in 2008.

But last summer French officials decided a new centre should be built as the number of people living rough in the port had swelled.

Yesterday, workmen from the local public works department were preparing the new site for the migrants, including building a small road for access.

Zakir, a 32-year-old from Afghanistan, said: ‘No one wanted to move but the police want us all on one site so they can keep a close eye on us.’

He added: ‘This is not a good place. There is no drinking water or shelter from the wind. At least at our old camp we could keep out of the wind, were able to get water. We have nothing here.’

Yards away, police arrested a young man and led him away in handcuffs after searching his tent.

Mr Mignonet said: ‘People living nearby are worried, and understandably so, but what can we do?’

■ Eleven suspected illegal immigrants believed to be from Syria were yesterday handed over to border force officials after being arrested on the M20.

Police were called at 7.15am after the group of men were seen climbing down from a tanker or lorry at the slip road near Folkestone.
