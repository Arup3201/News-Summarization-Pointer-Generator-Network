A council has come under fire for 'wasting' thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money on PR videos on subjects such as washing hands properly and bin collection times.

Warwickshire County Council, which is tasked with slashing £92million from its budget, spends £12,000 a year on the short films, which feature an attractive blonde presenter and a 'ticker tape' running headlines along the bottom of the screen.

Examples of titles uploaded on to YouTube include Keep Clean on Global Handwashing Day,  Dangers of Flu Illustrated and Budget Conversation hits the road - in which the council discusses how millions can be saved from the budget by 2018.

Around 600 council workers could lose their jobs as part of these plans.

Some videos on YouTube have as few as eight views - but the council insists many more people watch the videos on its own site. 

The council said it is one of the first to commission the videos - which are produced by a private contractor.

Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another example of a council preaching about the need to save money while squandering cash it on pointless initiatives.

'The last thing other local authorities should do is follow suit.

'Council bosses should worry less about looking cutting edge on YouTube and worry more about delivering the services residents actually need and rely on.

'Instead of producing overblown PR about budget cuts, Warwickshire Council should focus on finding savings by stopping wasteful spending on things like these unnecessary videos which will in turn save taxpayers’ cash.'

Warwickshire County Council, which has more than half a million constituents, said the YouTube hits were not representative of the number of people watching the videos, as they also stream on its own site.

David Carter, Director of Resources, said: 'Finding ways to engage with residents, and helping people to use our services, is key to the council’s communications strategy. 

'With more and more people accessing news online, we cannot stand still and video is recognised as an excellent way of enabling residents to easily follow our news and to share information through social media sites.

'Whilst reports in the media have suggested that only a handful of people are looking at the video news, we can assure residents that this is simply not true. 

'In actual fact, each video feature receives an average of 1,000 views and is playing a significant part in generating a significant level of traffic to the website.  

'This is particularly useful at times when we need to communicate important messages.  These might include emergencies such as flooding or severe weather closing schools or important health messages.  It does this at a cost of just over 2p per resident per year.'

The videos are made by contractors Reelcontent.

The company write a script which is approved by the council before the video is created in house.

The most popular video provides information about recycling centre opening times on a bank holiday weekend. The council said it received more than 2,500 views across all sites.

The lowest number of views was on video on a new dementia scheme  - with less than 200 views.
