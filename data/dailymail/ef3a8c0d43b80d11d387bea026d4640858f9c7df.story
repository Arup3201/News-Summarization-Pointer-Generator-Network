Britons are set to spend a whopping £19billion on Christmas presents -  but a new survey reveals what we really want from our loved ones is a holiday.  

Travel and entertainment deals provider Travelzoo released findings today suggesting that while accumulating material possessions does not bring lasting happiness – spending hard-earned cash on experiences does.

The survey polled over 2000 UK adults to find out which of their purchases over the past year have brought them the most pleasure and enjoyment, and also what they were most hoping to receive for Christmas this year.

Top of the pleasure and enjoyment scale are holidays – 81 per cent of people stated that money spent on jetting away gave them the best money/happiness ratio. 

In second place was live events such as concerts (69 per cent) and in third place was fine dining, with 56 per cent of people saying this had brought them the most enjoyment from their expense.

Louise Hodges, head of communications at Travelzoo said, 'We're seeing a real trend in people wanting to spend their money on presents that enable their loved ones to do amazing things and create memories, rather than accumulate more material possessions – or even worse, gifts that end up being returned or exchanged.'  

The infographic shows experience gifts such as holidays, concerts and spa days are well received
