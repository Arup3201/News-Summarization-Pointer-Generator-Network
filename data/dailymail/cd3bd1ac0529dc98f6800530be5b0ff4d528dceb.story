As Louis van Gaal gears up for his first taste of arguably the biggest match in English football this weekend, he can rest safely in the knowledge that his record in ‘Clasicos’ is outstanding.

During his time in Holland, Spain and Germany, Van Gaal has been involved in 29 ‘Clasicos’ with Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich – winning on an astonishing 18 occasions.

The Dutchman has suffered just seven defeats across ‘De Klassieker’ (Holland), ‘El Clasico’ (Spain) and Der Klassiker (Germany) in 23 years of management, meaning United fans can go into this game confident Van Gaal will have the magic formula to down Brendan Rodgers’ men.

Sportsmail takes a look at his incredible record.
