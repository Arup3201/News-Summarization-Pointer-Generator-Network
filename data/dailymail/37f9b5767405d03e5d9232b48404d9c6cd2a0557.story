Now a receipt allegedly from one of McIndoe's beach parties at Marbella's famous Ocean Club has emerged, reportedly showing how before he declared himself bankrupt, he had splashed the cash at the bar as he tried to impress investors.

The bill for 38,778.30 euros, worth around £28,600, shows magnums of Cristal and bottles of Champagne and is from 2011, although a copy was printed off in July 2013 by a member of staff.

It also details the 3,525.30 euro service charge.

One onlooker present claims McIndoe and his entourage had been gathered around the pool on two sunbeds in the venue's prestigious VIP section.

'They got 20 women and out of them they were all carrying two bottles each of champagne, but big 15 litre ones, Cristal – you name it,' he said.

'There are beds around the pool and all the girls brought them to the bed and they were sprayed everywhere – all to make him look like the boss.

'It is the largest beach club in the world, with a massive bar and pool in the middle and was renowned for its top quality parties.

'McIndoe had come there a couple of times. It was a holiday to treat some of the boys he was with.

'The end of that weekend before he went he was just there – he wanted to have a big show and try to get more investors. He was asking for the best people, the richest.

'It was a party to show people "look this is what I've got -  you could have this lifestyle".

'He sprayed half of the bottles for the first five minutes and then sprayed again. He wanted to make sure that people saw that he was there. He stayed there for the whole afternoon.

'McIndoe doesn't drink himself but his guests were worse for wear by the end of it.

'After that day I am told he never went back – he did his sales pitch and moved on.'

McIndoe is alleged to have persuaded footballers to invest in the scheme, then blew a fortune on women, cars, houses and holidays before bankruptcy.

Investors reportedly lost a combined £30 million when the scheme collapsed in late 2011.

The scheme is currently being investigated by police, while McIndoe has a bankruptcy hearing this week after previously telling the court that he was living off the generosity of friends and family.

A spokesman from the Metropolitan police confirmed to MailOnline that an allegation of fraud was made to Westminster CID in February last year. No arrests have been made.

At the height of his spending, McIndoe hired a modernist £2million mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree in Marbella. 

His friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs, while back in London he hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club.

'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme.

The scheme is thought to have attracted 300 players, including a number from the lower leagues, and he told original investors to get others involved so they could make more money. 

McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. 

Former players Bullard, who recently appeared on the TV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and Robbie Keane are thought to have lost more than £500,000 each. 

'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 

'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' 

McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £3 million and he told told the court in London at a hearing last month that he was penniless.

McIndoe said he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex.

'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing.  

Insolvency practitioners O’Haras Ltd, based in West Yorkshire, are trustees of his bankruptcy estate and the firm's director has said it is looking to recover money lost through McIndoe's gambling habits. 

Details of his account with bookmakers' William Hill, which were given to receivers as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, showed he had staked a total of £391,955 and his winnings were £309,505.76.

He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London.

After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment.

'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. 

However, the Spanish onlooker said he had little sympathy for McIndoe – only his alleged victims.

He added: 'What he is accused of doing to these people is an absolute joke.

'He took a lot of money off a lot of people. We are not talking thousands – we are talking millions.'
