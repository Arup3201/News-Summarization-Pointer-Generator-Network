A Qantas pilot has taken tiny wallaby joeys under his wing by flying them in the cockpit of his passenger jets between two zoos involved in a foster program aimed at boosting the species' flagging population.

When called upon, Nathan Koch, who is also a qualified vet, carries the joeys in lunchboxes on board flights he is piloting between Adelaide and Canberra and hands them to keepers from Adelaide Zoo or Canberra's Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve upon arrival.

The two centres are involved in a cross-species scheme in which southern rock and yellow footed joeys are taken out of their mothers' pouches and, when required, placed in a female wallaby 1200km away.

The program has helped double wallaby numbers by speeding up the animals' reproduction cycle and making use of females which aren't pregnant. 

Nathan Koch is also a practicing vet who not only transports the joeys to be fostered, he also implants them

A tiny wallaby is implanted into a foster wallaby's pouch as a part of a breeding program.

'It all started off as a bit of a coincidence, I was piloting a flight and I received a permit for wildlife to be on board,' said Mr Koch.

'I was expecting a huge animal enclosure but David Schulz of the Adelaide Zoo showed up with what looked like a small lunchbox. He explained the program to me and I was interested in getting involved.

'If breeding goes well wallabies can be pregnant back to back, so while one develops, another is in an earlier stage of development until the older one leaves the pouch.'

The program allows the wallaby mothers to rear up to six or seven times a year rather than once, making a big impact on the population.

Scott Ryan, from the Adelaide Zoo, said: 'If all four of our females are breeding we would normally only result in four joeys if all goes well but with the cross fostering program we are able to ideally result in eight healthy wallabies.'

Mr Koch added: 'My part is only small, it's the zoo and the reserve that do most of the hard work and have come up with this amazing program that is working. I am  thrilled to be involved and do my part.

The joeys only spend about six months with their foster mother before being transported back to their original species.

'The fact that yellow footed wallabies don't have a breeding season, it means that they can be breeding year long and their young can be reared by the southern brush tailed wallabies when they are off their breeding season,' said Mr Scott.

'If we didn't have the partnership with Qantas and without Nathan, the process would take much longer and it wouldn't be as easy on the animals because Nathan gets the joeys from the plane straight to the pouches. There is no lag time.

A Qantas spokesman said: 'Qantas is delighted to support Captain Nathan Koch in his involvement in the breeding program. It's only right that these precious little joeys travel with the Flying Kangaroo.'
