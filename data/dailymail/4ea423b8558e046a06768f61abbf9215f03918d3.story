The parents of Oscar Pistorius's dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp have spoken of the comfort they take from watching her posthumous appearance on a reality TV show.

June and Barry Steenkamp are still coming to terms with the death of their daughter, who was shot dead at Blade Runner's home in Pretoria, South Africa, in the
early hours of Valentine's Day.

Three days later, the producers of Tropika Island of Treasure were accused of insensitivity after screening the show so soon after she was killed.

But speaking publicly for the first time since her death, Mr and Mrs Steenkamp said the programme allows them to connect with her from beyond the grave when they watch it every week.

In the show, Miss 
Steenkamp competes alongside seven South African celebrities and seven 
other contestants to win a prize of one million rand prize (£72,500).

'She's alive, she's happy, she's swimming with dolphins,' Mrs Steenkamp told Grazia magazine.

'When I watched the first episode, 
where Reeva greets everyone and blows kisses, it felt as if she were 
talking to me. She was saying goodbye.'

TV bosses were accused of cashing in on her death after it emerged the television network was charging news outlets up to $3,000 for short clips of the show.

Producers argued its broadcast was a 'fitting tribute' to  the law graduate, but they have been accused of 
insensitivity for showing her post-eviction interview, where she 
discusses her 'journey in life' and the 'way you go out.'

Miss Steenkamp described herself as 'Brainy, blonde, bombshell' on the show, and said she had 'amazing memories' of her time on the programme

In one clip, Miss Steenkamp
is seen leaning against a palm tree on the show’s set in Jamaica, 
blowing kisses towards the camera, declaring: 'I’m going to miss you all
so much. I love you very, very much.'

At another point, she says: 'I think 
that the way you go out, not just your journey in life but the way that 
you go out and you make your exit is so important.'

The Steenkamps, who say they don't 
know when she will be voted off, have also revealed their grief over 
their daughter's killing.

Pistorius, a double amputee and 
six-time Paralympic sprint champion, was charged with premeditated 
murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally opening fire 
after mistaking her for an intruder at his home.

In the show, Reeva said she had a passion for cooking and loves spending quality time with her friends and family

Mrs Steenkamp told Grazia magazine said: 'He (Pistorius) still has his thoughts. He still has to answer for this.

'I don't want anything from him. What 
could he say to me? My daughter is dead and nothing is going to change 
that. I don't ever want to see him.

'My biggest regret is that Reeva will never have a wedding day. She'll never have a child. This is forever. It's the end.'

Mr Steenkamp said he hopes that he 
will know all the facts of what happened after the court case and have 
the strength to look Pistorius in the eye.

'I just feel it's necessary. For closure,' he said.

They plan to scatter her ashes in the sea at Bloubergstrand with Table Mountain in the background, according to Grazia.

Backlash: Criticism came after Miss Steenkamp's appearance on Tropika Island of Treasure, was screened just three days after the 29-year-old was shot four times at Pistorius's luxury home

Their contact with Pistorius is now only through lawyers.

Pistorius, 26, who competed at both 
the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, is staying with relatives as 
he awaits trial accused of shooting dead Ms Steenkamp, a 30 year-old 
model.

Mrs Steenkamp said her daughter 'led a
very exciting life and tried to do everything' adding 'it's almost as 
if she knew she only had a little time in which to get everything done'.

Ms Steenkamp had told her parents 
that Pistorius was a good man and she had been impressed by his charity 
work and fundraising for children with disabilities, according to the 
magazine.

Miss
Steenkamp was shot four times early on Valentine's Day at Pistorius’s 
luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria.

Police
have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a
pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have 
mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder.

He is currently on bail pending the trial.
