Missing: Bella Rose Goulding was taken from a Queensland home on Saturday night. Police are searching for three men and a woman who may be known to the family

A two-year-old girl has been abducted from a Queensland home during a brazen attack on Saturday night.

The toddler, named by police as Bella Rose Goulding, was taken around 7.15pm after three men allegedly burst into a home in suburban Willowbank, outside Ipswich in Queensland.

The girl's father, Steven Goulding, said he struggled to try rescue his daughter but could not break free from the 'big guy' who had him restrained.

Mr Goulding told The Courier Mail: 'I just tried to reach for her, but the big guy pushed me back against wall.

He told police that, as they left, he had his face 'smashed' in.

He said: 'They just basically busted in, took the little child, and as I went to walk out the door they smashed me across the face.'

It is understood there were other children in the home at the time.

Queensland police are treating the situation as 'a matter of extreme urgency', and want to speak with three men and one woman who were sighted at the time of the event.

It is understood those responsible may be known to the family, and police are investigating whether they have links to the girl's mother, who has been involved in a custody dispute over the toddler.

Quiet suburban street: Sancroft Street in Willowbank, where the toddler was taken on Saturday night

A white Holden Commodore and a silver Mitsubishi sedan was seen driving slowly along Sancroft Street where the girl was taken.

A neighbour said he saw the one of the cars but heard nothing from the house at the time the girl was taken.

Another resident, Melissa Bolt, also said she heard no noise come from the house.

“It must have happened very quickly,” Mrs Bolt said.

Bella Rose Goulding is described as Caucasian with blonde curly hair and blue eyes.

She was last seen wearing a pink Dora The Explorer T-shirt and grey leggings.
