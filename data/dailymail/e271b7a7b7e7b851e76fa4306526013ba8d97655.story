Tesco shopper Ceri Morgan, 40, was arrested after he uploaded a porn image onto one of the stores display iPads

A Tesco shopper uploaded hardcore porn onto the stores display iPad as a joke, a court heard.

Ceri Morgan, 40, uploaded the porn image onto the tablet computer and set it as the 'wallpaper'.

The father-of-one then tried to remove the picture showing a 'sex act,' but was unable to delete it. 

The 40-year-old was confronted by security staff who told him the picture  'was not a laugh' because children often use it.

Police were called to the Tesco Extra store in Swansea, South Wales, and arrested Morgan who was with his own son at the time.

The mechanic admitted causing the display of indecent matter after being hauled before Swansea Magistrates Court.

Prosecutor Anwen Evans said: 'A security guard followed him on CCTV system and could see him pay particular attention to one of the display ipads.

'He zoomed in and could see that he had uploaded an indecent image.He then saw him make it larger, and leave it clearly on display in store.'

Morgan had gone to the store to buy a charger - but he ended up transferring the offensive image from his own mobile phone onto the iPad.

When police arrived at the store in October last year he told officers: 'I realise it was wrong. I tried to remove it but I could not.'

Magistrates  heard how the picture was only seen by Tesco workers and not any members of the public.

Alex Scott, defending, said: 'He did not intend to cause any alarm or distress.

'He was looking at the iPad section and on the spur of the moment made a somewhat foolish and immature decision to take pornographic pictures from his phone and upload it as background.

'It was intended as a joke, but unfortunately it back-fired spectacularly. He had some difficulty in removing it from the background and there was an element of panic.

Staff at Tesco Extra in Swansea, South Wales, called police after telling Morgan 'it was not a laugh'

'It was intended as a joke, it was not sexually motivated, it was an isolated and foolish decision.

'Yes, it was misguided and immature, but it was not intended to cause distress to anyone else.'

Morgan was made the subject to a 12-month community order, with 100 hours unpaid work, and ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £60.
