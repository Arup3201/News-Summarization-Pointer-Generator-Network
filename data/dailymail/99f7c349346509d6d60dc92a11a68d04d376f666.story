Pledge: Eric Pickles is attempting to shame councils into restoring weekly bin collections

Millions of homes are to have their weekly bin collections restored, Eric Pickles will pledge today.

The Local Government Secretary will reveal more than 70 councils intend to use a £250million government fund to end unpopular fortnightly schemes.

Mr Pickles is attempting to shame what he will call the ‘town hall Talibin’ into restoring weekly collections, saying councils have ‘no excuse’ not to bring them back and voters should punish those which don’t.

‘Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120 per month council tax,’ he will say.

‘Labour’s barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik’s cube.

'The public are fed up of all the bin dos and don’ts – they just want a simple service, which is why the Government is making sure councils offer a good weekly collection and make it easier to go green.

'We’ve called time on the town hall Talibin, and have ditched Labour’s policies of bin cuts, bin fines and bin taxes in the dustbin of history.’

Since Labour’s 1997 election victory, half of households – ten million covered by 180 local authorities – have lost their weekly collections.

Instead, local authorities have been encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks.

However, homeowners have complained 
the change has led to rises in pest populations, unpleasant smells from 
waste left uncollected, and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on
anyone breaking the rules.

Those who overfill their bins or accidentally leave rubbish out on the wrong day risk penalties of up to £1,000.

The Daily Mail has long campaigned to have weekly collections restored.

Mr Pickles will argue today it is possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly collections of all rubbish.

He will point to the example of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering people incentives such as shopping vouchers and loyalty card points.

Mr Pickles said councils could also use the new cash to introduce technology such as ‘mechanical biological treatment’ facilities, where rubbish is sorted into recyclable items and those that need to go to landfill.

Even before the Government has formally opened the scheme, more than 70 councils have signalled their intention to restore weekly collections.

The Local Government Secretary’s announcement follows a fierce battle between him and Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, who had tried to ditch a Tory pledge to restore traditional weekly collections, which were first required by law 136 years ago.

Even before the election, the Conservatives said they would provide funding for councils that abandoned fortnightly pick-ups.

The Environment Department has argued that these had helped boost recycling rates and reduced the amount of refuse buried in landfill sites.

Hilary Benn, Labour’s local government spokesman, said: ‘Local people are best placed to decide how rubbish is collected.

‘Sitting behind his desk in Whitehall, Eric Pickles should trust communities to do this rather than thinking that he knows better.’
