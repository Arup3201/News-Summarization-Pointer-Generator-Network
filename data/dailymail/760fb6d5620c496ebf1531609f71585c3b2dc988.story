After weeks of promotion, Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly finally come together in the most bitter of grudge matches and in an eliminator for the WBO world cruiserweight title.

The build-up has made both fighters household names. We sold out the Echo Arena in 48 hours, it's the fastest-ever selling sporting event there and the pay-per-view numbers look really strong.

I've been nervous this week. We've seen some grudge matches before but this is more bitter than I've ever experienced.

With George Groves against Carl Froch it was a case of, 'I can't stand that bloke,' but this is more like, 'I want to finish him now.'

Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew get set for their rematch at Liverpool's Echo Arena on Saturday

Both Cleverly and Bellew weighed in in Liverpool ahead of their cruiserweight clash

The atmosphere wasn't pleasant at the press conference on Thursday or up on stage at the weigh-in because it was very personal; there were plenty of insults traded.

I think Nathan believes that Tony is using these insults because he's desperate. To be honest, I thought Tony would lose his marbles more than he has but he’s been able to keep it together.

Obviously Tony will have the majority of the support with the fight being in Liverpool but I think this is the kind of event to which neutrals will come. If you are a neutral, you'd probably favour Nathan because he has kept himself to himself in the build-up. You're more likely to have an opinion of Tony.

There is plenty of bad blood between the pair, who have fought on one previous occasion

Security step in as things get heated on stage at the weigh in for Saturday's fight

Marco Huck, the WBO champion, and the WBC champion Grigory Drozd are flying in to see what is the biggest fight in the division; they all want to fight the winner.

Either fighter against Huck and either fighter against the winner of Ola Afolabi against IBF champion Yoan Hernandez is a massive fight.

But if you asked Nathan and Tony if they'd rather win a world title or win on Saturday night, the answer would be to win this fight. It means much more to them than a world title.

I believe there's a future for both of them in the division but losing is not an option for either of them. I really like both guys and my job as a promoter is to provide the best fights, and that was this one.

Welshman Cleverly weighed in just below the 200lb cruiserweight limit set for the fight

Bellew was also just inside the weight limit at 199lbs when he stepped on the scales

But unfortunately one of them will lose and he will be my fighter. Normally I am screaming and shouting at ringside but I won't be this time. I don't have any favourites, it's a case of may the best man win.

There are so many questions surrounding this fight. We don't know how hard Tony punches at cruiserweight. He's had two good knockouts against two durable fighters but Nathan stood up to Tony before.

How mentally strong is Nathan? He looked massive on the scales but does he still have the speed he had at light-heavyweight. Does he punch harder? 

The only argument I don't think you can make is a Tony Bellew victory on points; that's the only result I don't see happening. I see Nathan on points and by stoppage and I see Tony by stoppage.

I think it will come down to game plans going out the window and both guys trading and one guy getting knocked out spectacularly. It could be either one.

Bellew is determined to beat Cleverly this time having pushed him all the way during their first meeting

Whatever happens, I want both men to shake hands but I don't think they will which is a shame. But that's one of the reasons the fight is so big, because of that vicious rivalry.

The point of boxing is to leave it all in the ring and afterwards it is about respect. I will be straight in the ring to tell both fighters to congratulate each other. I tried to do it after Froch-Groves I but it didn't really work out because of the way it finished. Sometimes it runs too deep and this might be another example of that.

George Groves and James DeGale are heading for a rematch and it almost happened after the weigh-in when both camps came face-to-face and the fighters had to be pulled apart by security.

There were family members and team members involved. They don't like each other and it goes way back. You talk about Nathan and Tony but this goes way deeper; back to when they were teenagers.

There is a lot of history there and it's distracting because they're both in big fights on Saturday night.

James DeGale is on course for a rematch with Groves and their camps clashed on Friday at the weigh-in

James has a tough fight against Marco Antonio Periban and George takes on Denis Douglin but it's the kind of distraction that could sometimes prove to be a banana skin.

What it means, however, is that the rematch gets bigger and bigger; it looks inevitable for next year.

Also on the undercard, Scott Quigg defends his world title against Hidenori Otake who is unbeaten in 17 fights since 2007 and is here to win. He has brought 20 or 30 people to watch him; boxing is big in Japan and they have a lot of world champions. I think it's going to be tough; he's very durable. Quigg is getting better but I expect this to be his toughest fight yet.

Jamie McDonnell also has a very tough fight against late replacement Javier Chacon who was already in training. He's a little rottweiler and will be on Jamie non stop. But our man must win to secure his unification clash with Tomoki Kameda next year.

Callum Smith against Nikola Sjekloca is such a great fight. The Montenegrins are here to win. It's the same group who came over with Dejan Zlaticanin who beat Ricky Burns and they fully believe they are going to beat Callum. He has his hands full.

Olympic heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua meets the experienced Michael Sprott. Many feel that AJ's speed and power will be too much for Sprott, but he has other ideas and is really up for this one.

Keep your eyes peeled also for recent signing Bradley Saunders, lightweight champ Scotty Cardle and German KO king Vincent Figenburtz.
