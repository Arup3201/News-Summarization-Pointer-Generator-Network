After undergoing the new 'spray-on' skin treatment, Alison Portass can wear her bikini with confidence

Scars are a constant and vivid reminder of an injury or illness that many people would prefer to forget. Every year, countless hundreds of thousands are left with scarring following accidents, bad acne or surgery.

But could a form of 'spray-on' skin made from the patient's own skin cells help?

One of those who have had the treatment is Alison Portass. When she discovered she had breast cancer for the second time at the age of 57 - nearly three decades after getting the all-clear - it came as a huge blow.

But a double mastectomy, although traumatic, cut the risk of her cancer returning, and an immediate reconstruction meant it had minimal impact on her figure.

However, Alison was left with a large scar stretching from hip to hip, where doctors had taken skin to use in the reconstructive surgery. 'The surgeon did a wonderful job, with any scarring on the breast hidden,' says Alison, now 62, a nurse from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire.

'But I hated that scar on my abdomen - it was shrunken, lumpy and red with white patches, around 10in long and nearly three-quarters of an inch wide. I was grateful to the surgeons for saving my life, but it left me with a very poor body image.

'I'm not fat and I'm not old, but I still felt I had to cover up, even on the beach.'

Today, however, thanks to treatment with the new spray-on skin, her scar has almost disappeared.

Scars form when the dermis - the deeper, connective layer of the skin - is damaged. Their severity depends on the extent of injury as well as the skin's repair response, and on the behaviour of collagen, a protein that acts like a glue in wound healing.

In normal skin, the collagen bundles are laid down in a neat, criss-cross pattern, and when healing goes smoothly, scars are flat and often improve in colour over time.

But sometimes the repair process gets out of hand. Cells known as fibroblasts, which produce collagen, go into overdrive and a new system of blood vessels is set up to feed the scar, which triggers extra collagen.

The bundles of this protein then form rigid, parallel lines, sometimes gluing layers of tendon and tissue together to form lumps.

Damage to the epidermis (the top layer of skin) can also affect the keratinocytes - cells that create healthy skin - and the melanocytes, which produce the pigment responsible for skin colour.

'Most scars improve by themselves over time, so it can be worth waiting a few months to a year before embarking on treatments,' says Dr Sajjad Rajpar, consultant dermatologist at the Midland Skin Institute at BMI The Priory Hospital Birmingham and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

'Options for treating severe scarring include excising or cutting out the scar to renew it and replacing it with a matrix - essentially substances that contain collagen and allow new tissues to grow through them to fill the depth of a burn scar - but this can create more scarring.

'Laser treatment can help reduce the redness in fresh scars, perhaps by reducing the blood vessels, and in some instances help flatten raised scars.'

New technology called ReCell sprays the affected area with healthy skin cells, stimulating the growth of new, vibrant skin

Chemical peels can also be used for acne scars, stripping away the damaged layer of skin, which the body replaces with healthy skin.

With severe burns, doctors repair the damaged area with a skin graft. However, the cosmetic results can be variable and the grafts can shrink over time.

But with a new technology, known as ReCell, a sliver of healthy skin is removed under local anaesthetic. The active cells are scraped off and placed in the ReCell kit, which uses an enzyme to break down the healthy skin so that it can be suspended in a solution.

With a syringe, this is then sprayed over the site of the injury, where the cells are stimulated to replicate and create healthy, new skin that can cover an area up to 80 times the size of the donor patch.

ReCell allows for rapid healing by providing the right mix of cells for it to happen.

One study, published in the journal Burns, which compared ReCell and skin grafting for partial-thickness burns (where the epidermis and dermis are damaged) found similar results for both methods.

Although skin grafting was quicker, it caused more pain in the area where the grafting patch was taken from and was more invasive, said the researchers. A trial is to start at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge using ReCell to treat leg ulcers.

Alison Portass had the treatment in August 2011.

'After years of not feeling my best, I
 finally feel happy with my body again. I'm amazed such a painless 
treatment could make such a difference.'

First, she was given a local anaesthetic in her thigh and then, using a scalpel, the surgeon removed a postage-stamp sized patch, about 1-2mm thick.

Healthy skin cells were scraped off the patch and made into a solution. The surgeon then lasered the damaged scar tissue, and put the solution of healthy skin cells across the long scar, before covering the area with a light dressing.

When Alison's dressing came off a week after the treatment, a thin layer of healthy skin was growing. Over the next year, it thickened gradually.

As she recalls: 'The scar was changing day by day. It was less lumpy, and instead of being angry and red it was fading, and it looked almost like my normal skin - just a tad darker.'

Within 12 months it was barely visible, and the following year, Alison wore a bikini on holiday.

'After years of not feeling my best, I finally feel happy with my body again. I'm amazed such a painless treatment could make such a difference.'

As Zahida Butt, a cosmetic surgeon at the Norwich Cosmetic Clinic where Alison had the treatment, explains: 'ReCell is very exciting because it means we can create new healthy skin. It can be done immediately, and is more cost effective than other methods.

'Furthermore, those with severe burns need treatment immediately and there is a delay in transporting skin from labs.

'When the skin comes from another person, there is a risk of rejection. And over time, a skin graft will contract as a person grows, whereas ReCell cells divide and grow with the body.'

ReCell is currently being used on the NHS for burns atÂ  centres including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. It is also available privately for other conditions.
