As blustery weather sweeps across Britain, the stunning sight of 420ft wind turbines has created something of a spectacle off the coast.

The turbines, near Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, which provide power for 125,000 homes, even dwarfed a large tanker in the surrounding North Sea.

They are part of the Gunfleet Sands Wind Farm, run by Danish firm Dong Energy, which has just installed two more turbines that stand at 485ft.
