You might think the future of driving will be limited to ‘boring’ driverless cars that take us from place to place.

But Toyota has other ideas in mind with their FV2 bike that looks like something out of the film Tron.

They claim the bike, while autonomous, will be ‘driving fun in the future’ by reading your emotions and providing information on its augmented reality display.

Although teased before, the bike has now been unveiled at the New York Auto Show, which runs from 18 to 27 April.

If you think it looks like something plucked out of the realms of science fiction, you wouldn’t be wrong.

The FV2, which stands for ‘Fun Vehicle 2,’ is intended to give us a glimpse of a future where vehicle interaction between man and machine is greater than ever.

Length: 3 metresWidth: 1.6 metresHeight (sleep mode): 0.99 metresHeight (driving mode): 1.78 metresWheelbase: 2.36 metresSeating capacity: 1

The bike has four wheels: one at the rear, two in the middle and one at the front.

At the top of the bike is a sliding panel that closes when the bike is not in use.

‘Unlocking’ the bike will slide the panel up, allowing you to sit in the middle and also provide an interactive display on the panel’s interior.

Using this display you can then give the bike a destination you wish to travel to.

The 2010 movie Tron: Legacy features 'light cycles' that look fairly similar to Toyota's FV2

The bike's display uses augmented reality to display real-time information, and the windshield also changes colour from red to green according to your mood

The bike seems to offer a number of different positions for a rider to be in, from kneeling to standing.

How the rider would remain stable in some of these positions is unclear, but perhaps Toyota are planning to include safety handles of some kind.

It’s also unclear what will power the bike, although an electric engine seems most likely.

The sizeable rear of the bike could house the engine, or perhaps provide space for luggage as well.

From the specifications the bike also seems quite large and fast – this is certainly something intended for road use rather than bike lanes or pavements.

While the hardware specifications are still unknown, Toyota has been busy touting the interactive functionality.

As mentioned earlier, the interior of the upright panel has an interactive display on which, among other things, you can enter destinations and view traffic reports.

But the FV2 also reads emotions and can adjust its driving accordingly. The windshield, for example, changes colour with your mood.

If you’re angry it will appear red, alerting other drivers to your agitated state of mind. It will only turn green when you’re in a better mood.

And if you were upset, the FV2 might suggest going to one of your favourite spots to relax.

Whether this will be more distracting than innovative remains to be seen.

But don’t think the bike is all about automation.

You can also direct the bike to enter ‘driver mode’, where you can control it by tilting your body from side to side.

About halfway through the video, Toyota also shows how the interactive screen can be used to display augmented reality directions.

No release date for the bike has been announced yet, and whether it would be allowed on main roads is unknown.

But the design at least provides a glimpse of a future where driverless vehicles may be commonplace.

For now, there is a 'Toyota FV2' app available on iOS and Android that lets you try driving the bike in a virtual environment.
