David Cameron and Nick Clegg are set to create up to 50 new peers this week – packing the House of Lords with political cronies after promising to slash its size.

The Prime Minister and his Liberal Democrat deputy proposed legislation that would have cut the 800-strong Lords to only 450.

But senior Whitehall sources say the reform plans have been scrapped and the Coalition is set to announce around 50 new peers – including high-profile party donors.

Packed: David Cameron and Nick Clegg are set to create 50 new peers this week and 100 over two years

Around 15 are expected to be Lib Dems, 
including Rumi Verjee, the businessman who brought Domino's Pizza to 
Britain and gave £775,000 to the party.

The plans put Mr Cameron on course to create the most peers in a Parliament of any Prime Minister in recent memory.

He has already ennobled 125 at a rate of nearly 50 a year, compared with an average of 35 for Tony Blair and only 15 for Margaret Thatcher.

A further 100 Lords will be created over the next two years in pursuit of the Coalition's goal of making the composition of the Upper House match the result of the general election.

This will raise the Lords to a bloated talking shop of more than 900 members.

Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett today brands the move an insult to the intelligence of the public after the reduction plans were ditched because Mr Clegg did not get his wish of an elected second chamber.

In an article for the Daily Mail, Mr Blunkett writes: 'As it happens, the House of Lords is already creaking at the seams. There are not enough coat pegs, never mind enough desks for their Lordships to sit at.'

Mr Cameron confirmed earlier this month that it is still his goal to make the political balance of the Lords match that of the Commons.

To ensure that the distribution of seats between the three main parties in the 2010 general election is mirrored in the Lords would require 67 new Conservative peers and 88 Liberal Democrats – 155 in all.

That would give the Tories 297, Labour their current 224 and the Liberal Democrats 178.

Tory and Lib Dem sources both confirmed that around 50 peers was the 'right ballpark' for nominations this week, leaving another 100 or so for the period before the general election.

Controversially, the Government has also overturned a ban introduced after the cash for peerages scandal on people being nominated solely for work done in the political arena.

Sources close to the deputy prime minister defended him against a charge of hypocrisy for creating new peers despite his wishes to slash the size of the Lords.

A source said: 'You have to deal with the world as you find it, rather than the world as you would like it to be.

'If it was up to us we would have an entirely democratically elected House of Lords.'
