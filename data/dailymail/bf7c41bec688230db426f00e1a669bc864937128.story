A mother-of-six who coughed up a tumour a year ago has been told she is now free of cancer.

Claire Osborn, 38, had the shock of her life when she started coughing and a 2cm lump flew out of her mouth.

She took the lump to her doctor and was told it was a type of cancer called metastatic adenocarcinoma - an aggressive throat and mouth cancer.

Ms Osborn was initially given a 50 per cent chance of survival and had to undergo an operation to see if there were any remaining cancer cells.

An initial scan in February revealed there were no other tumours and now, after a final scan last week, doctors have told her she is entirely free of cancer.

Ms Osborn said: 'The consultant turned round to me and said, "It appears you have coughed up your cancer. Congratulations."'

Ms Osborn, of Holbrooks, Coventry, said the events of the last year have completely changed her outlook on life - at one point she had started saving for her own funeral.

She said: 'I feel like it’s been a miracle. I feel I’ve been reborn, everything has changed. I really feel I’ve been given a second chance at life.

'I have various conditions including Asperger’s and fibromyalgia but I don’t sit down and mope now.

'I had become unsociable and wouldn’t go out and I used to get upset about the smallest things, like if I broke something around the house. But now I realise that life is far more important than a broken item.

'I have a social life now, I go out, I
go to church and I have lots of friends. I try to raise awareness of 
cancer by telling people what happened to me.'

Ms Osborn said the experience and the initial worry she was going to die from cancer has changed the whole family.

She said: 'It’s brought the family closer together. I have six children and two grandchildren and this has changed us all.

'I used to think it was only me going through this but now I can see they have suffered too, watching me go through it.'

Ms Osborn is now applying to Guinness World Records as she believes she is the only person to have coughed up an entire tumour.

Remembering
the day she had her coughing fit last year, Ms Osborn said: 'I’d taken 
some tablets and they felt like they were sticking at the back of my 
throat.

'I coughed and something came out. I 
went to the GP and he sent it off to the lab where it was diagnosed as 
metastatic adenocarcinoma.

'The
metastatic part means the cancer spreads from one organ to another so 
I’m extremely lucky. If I hadn’t coughed it up it would have spread to 
another organ.

'I had a scan in February and it came back saying I had no cancer.

'I’ve just had my second MRI and there’s been no regrowth. It looks like I actually coughed up all of the cancer.

'I’ve got to go back in two months’ time for checks but I probably won’t need any more scans. The likelihood of this coming back is extremely small.'

However, the full-time mother added: 'Anyone with a persistent cough should get checked out as a precaution.'
