Tribunal: Sarah Persad was 'guilty of worse conduct' than the male workers she accused of harassment

A 39-year-old female IT worker who claimed she had to endure an 'offensive and sexualised culture' in the office has had her case dismissed at an employment tribunal.

Sarah Persad took her ex-employer Benenden Hospital Trust, in Kent, to Ashford Employment Tribunal for sexual harassment and breach of equal pay laws.

Mrs Persad said she was told 'not to be too sensitive and just get on with it' when she complained to the Trust.

But her formal grievance was rejected with bosses finding that what she considered to be 'sexually explicit attention and rumours' was no more than 'banter'.

She resigned in March last year and made a claim with the employment tribunal that she had been bombarded with lewd jokes, sexual invitations and talk of a sexual nature.

She accused one colleague of making remarks about his vasectomy and ejaculation and another of demanding that she made the coffee.

The Trust strenuously denied her claims throughout and insisted that she was a willing participant in a culture of banter.

During the tribunal proceedings it was revealed that Mrs Persad had sent emails making sexual comments and including images of semi-naked men and women in sexual poses to the male colleagues she alleged were guilty of sexually harassing her.

Mrs Persad insisted she had stopped sending such emails by August 2009.

The married mother-of-three withdrew her claims on November 19 and the Trust applied for costs.

In a separate, costs order hearing, employment judge Mr S G Vowles found that her claim of sexual harassment was 'untenable because she herself was a willing participant and clearly led and encouraged such conduct'.

It added: 'Indeed she was guilty of similar and worse conduct.'

It was ruled at the costs hearing that this evidence, once disclosed to her, made her continued pursuit of sexual harassment allegations 'unreasonable', concluding she was 'guilty of similar and worse conduct.'

Hearings: Mrs Persad must pay former employer Benenden Hospital Trust 40 per cent towards their legal costs

It was also ruled her complaint of indirect sex discrimination had 'no foundation.'

Her allegation of unequal pay was 
also judged to be 'misconceived'Â  and based upon a 'wholly unrealistic' 
job evaluation review conducted by herself, which, if accepted, would 
have moved her from being the most junior member of the IT team to being
its director.

Mrs Persad was ordered to pay 40 per cent of her former employer's overall costs which were yet to be assessed.
