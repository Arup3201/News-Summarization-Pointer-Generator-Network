Jonathan Martin has been claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers.

Aday after his release from the San Francisco 49ers, the offensive tackle joins his third NFL franchise in three years.

Martin was a second round pick for Miami in 2012 and was at the centre of the Dolphins bullying scandal. He was abused by team-mates Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey and left the franchise in October 2013.

Jonathan Martin heads to Carolina after drawing a close to his one-year stint with the San Francisco 49ers

Martin joined San Francisco last year and played 15 games at right tackle.

The 25-year-old joins Michael Oher, who came to Carolina in free agency after a year with Tennessee, and the returning Mike Remmers on a revamped offensive line.

'Our goal is to build the strongest roster possible and add competition at every position,' Carolina general manager Dave Gettleman said in a team release. "Jonathan brings quality experience to our offensive line, having started 32 games in his career at both tackle spots.''

Carolina also strengthened their receiving corps with the addition of Jarrett Boykin on a one-year deal.
