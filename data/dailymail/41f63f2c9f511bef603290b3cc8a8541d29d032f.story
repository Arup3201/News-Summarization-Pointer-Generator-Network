Four lucky men who think their partners are out of their league have become the finalists in a 'Punching Above Your Weight' couple competition.

Dave Scott and Sarah Oliver, Paula and Stephen Black, Liam and Victoria Barrett, and Lee Hodgson and Leanne Westlake are battling it out to become crowned the UK's most mismatched couple in a competition held by Newcastle's Metro Radio.

The finalists beat hundreds of entrants to make it to the top four, and the winners of the tongue-in-cheek competition will win a luxury seven night holiday in a five-star resort in Corfu.

Originally there were five finalists, but one couple were disqualified from the competition after producers discovered that Andrea Burlington, 36, of South Shields, had entered her deceased husband. 

Andrea explained that her husband Andrew Bedlington had sadly passed away in October 2013, but she still wanted to enter in tribute to her late husband as a way of keeping his memory alive: 'I felt like I was doing something with him again,' she says,'it was wonderful.'

Andrew, who had two children with Andrea, sadly passed away in 2013

'It was my daughter who suggested I enter the competition, and as the conditions said nothing about the entrants being alive, I thought why not! 

Andrea brought Andrew's ashes into the studios in the urn usually kept next to her bed. Surprised station bosses checked with their legal team and despite her being selected as a finalist, the rules stipulated that the holiday must be awarded to a winning couple, whereas Andrea wanted to take her and Andrew's two children, Shannon, 18, and Chloe, 11.

The Metro Radio team decided to treat Andrea and her children to another holiday anyway and an emotional Andrea said: 'I couldn't believe it. Andrew was the breadwinner and I was a stay at home mum, there would be no way I would have be able to take the kids anywhere in the foreseeable future.'

Steve Furnell from the Steve & Karen Breakfast show who are holding the competition says: 'Andrea has been so fantastic. It's been an emotional roller coaster and we're so happy that we were able to give her and her girls the chance to go away too. Now it's time to get cracking with our final four couples who'll battle it out for the holiday prize.'

The couple, who got married last September say friends have often joked that they are mismatched:

'My sister Marie, who I work with in the salon, encouraged me to enter because she has heard Stephen's friends saying he was punching above his weight with me.' says Paula.

'I've heard it too - it is the standard joke. We'd love to win!'
