The disabled mother of the youngest British soldier killed in Afghanistan has told of her heartbreak after being forced to betray her son’s dying wish.

Lucy Aldridge, 44, knew her son William wanted his £218,000 life insurance and death benefit package to pass to his younger brothers and eventually pay their university tuition fees.

But Lucy, who suffers from hypermobility syndrome, has had to live off William’s estate since the Department for Work and Pensions stopped her £180 weekly income support and housing benefit payments.

Distraught: Lucy Aldridge has been forced to live off her deceased son William's estate after the Department for Work and pensions cut her Disability Allowance

She told the DWP she wanted to put William’s estate in a trust until his brothers, Archie and George, aged eight and seven, start university.

Her case was dismissed and when Lucy challenged the DWP’s decision last year, the Ministry of Justice ruled there was no distinction between William’s fund and windfalls such as National Lottery wins and inheritances.

Lucy, from Bromyard, Herefordshire, said:
‘The threshold for a claimant’s savings or assets is £16,000.

'So when I
became administrator of my son’s estate, I lost my means-tested 
benefits.

Loss: Lucy's son William was killed in Afghanistan three years ago, aged 18

‘I’ve been registered disabled for six years. I can’t work and can barely walk to the end of  my road. The DWP’s position punishes me and William because I am disabled.

He would turn in his grave if he knew. Week by week I withdraw money from his estate to keep a roof over my head.

'It breaks my heart. Legally, there is nothing I can do to get my benefits back.’

Rifleman William Aldridge, of 2nd Battalion, the Rifles, was just 18 years and 47 days old when he was killed by a Taliban mine in July 2009.

Last night Tory MP John Glen said: ‘The law should protect Lucy, not punish her.

'Compensation for the death of  a loved one while serving in war should be treated differently.’

A DWP spokesman said: ‘Money can never compensate for the loss of a loved one, but families of our servicemen and women killed on active duty do receive financial support.’
