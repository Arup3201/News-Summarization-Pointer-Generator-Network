American sprinter Justin Gatlin has failed to make the list of finalists for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award.

Gatlin, undefeated in the 100 and 200 meters this season, was among the original 10 nominees for the prize. 

But, after a two-week voting process, he was not named as one of the three finalists when the news was announced on Friday.

Dennis Kipruto Kimetto, seen celebrating his Marathon success in Berlin in September,  is one of the three names on the shortlist for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year

Mutaz Essa Barshim, seen competing in the IAFF Diamond League earlier this year, is also on the shortlist

The 32-year-old served a four-year ban after testing positive for testosterone in 2006.

His nomination had angered some athletes and officials, with Olympic discus champion Robert Harting of Germany withdrawing from consideration for the award.

Lord Coe also criticised the decision to include Gatlin in the original 10-man list.

The three finalists are Qatari high jumper Mutaz Essa Barshim, Kenyan World marathon runner Dennis Kipruto Kimetto and French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie.
