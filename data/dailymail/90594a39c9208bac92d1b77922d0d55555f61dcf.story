What lengths would you go to to watch your team play during the World Cup?

According to research, a surprising percentage of football fans would bribe their spouse, postpone their wedding, or even miss the birth of their baby.

The study also revealed the vast array of superstitions football fans have to ‘ensure’ their team wins.

A survey has revealed how far football fans will go to watch their team play in the World Cup. Some 7% would postpone their wedding for a match, while 18% said they would bribe their partner out of the house. England's first game is against Italy on Saturday 14 June at the Arena da Amazonia stadium in Manaus (pictured)

In the research, carried out by OnePoll for Pringles, 2,000 UK football fans were asked a series of questions.

The fear of bad luck can be reversed by carrying out rituals like touching wood and throwing salt, according to a study by the University of Chicago.

Touching wood is the most common superstition in Western culture used to reverse bad fortune or undo a ‘jinx’, while other cultures maintain similar practices, like spitting or throwing salt, after someone has tempted fate.

Even people who aren't particularly superstitious often participate in these practices.

The study found that these superstitions actually do ‘reverse’ perceived 
likelihood of bad fortune.

And people believe that negative outcomes are especially likely after a jinx.

This uncovered the tactics some fans will be using to ensure they don’t miss a match when the tournament kicks off next week.

For example, almost one fifth (18 per cent) admitted they would bribe their partner with cash to shop or go out with friends, so they can watch the match undisturbed.

Some 
steadfast supporters would also reschedule life events; 7 per cent said they'd be willing to
 postpone their wedding to watch their team's match, while nearly one in
 ten (8 per cent) said they’d even skip the birth of their baby.

Of the respondents, 45 per cent were men.

The research also revealed how superstitious football fans are, with half of the respondents saying they had a matchday superstition or ritual.

Of these superstitious participants, half insist on sitting in the same ‘lucky seat’ to watch each match and 45 per cent only drink from a special, ‘lucky’ pint glass.

Items of clothing also proved popular good luck charms with more than one in ten (12 per cent) men donning ‘lucky undies’ and nearly a quarter (23 per cent) wearing a lucky T-shirt while watching a game.

Is this the only safe way to watch England in a penalty shoot-out? In the study one in eight football fans admitted that, if a game in the World Cup comes to spot kicks, they will be watching from behind their sofa in the hope that it will help the team win

When it 
comes to penalty shoot-outs, though, one in eight football fans believed
 hiding behind the sofa would increase the team's chance of winning.

‘We
 usually carry out rituals to help us deal with worries about 
uncertainty and bring about good luck,’ said Richard Wiseman, Professor 
of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of 
Hertfordshire.

‘But
 these superstitions can have a real effect, with research showing that 
sportsmen’s rituals, such as wearing lucky boots or tying their laces in
 a certain way, can focus the mind and actually enhance on-pitch 
performance.’
