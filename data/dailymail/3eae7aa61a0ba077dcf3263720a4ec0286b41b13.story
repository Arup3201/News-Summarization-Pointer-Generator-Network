A drunken burglar who ‘blundered’ into a house after downing a bottle of tequila and told the homeowner his own name has been jailed.

Kier Ruffell stole a Samsung mobile phone worth £100 from the family home in South Shields.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 21-year-old wandered into the sitting room of the house on Biddick Hall Drive at around 10.50pm on Saturday 23 June 2012.

Named and shamed: Kier Ruffell, 21, blurted out his own name to the 
owner of the home he had broken into after downing a bottle of Tequilla

The female occupant of the house was upstairs with her husband and 11-year-old son when Ruffell entered their home.

Prosecuting, Paul Rowland said: 'She went downstairs to let the family puppy into the back garden.

'In so doing the patio door was left insecure.

'On re-entering the living room she saw the defendant.

'She asked him who he was and he replied ‘Kier.’

'She shouted for her husband and the defendant left the premises.'

It was not until the next day that the householders noticed that a Samsung mobile telephone had gone missing.

Ruffell was arrested and interviewed on June 25.

He originally refused to comment but later accepted that he had been on the premises.

Ruffell told police that he had consumed a bottle of tequila and could not recall taking the telephone in question.

Appearing in court via videolink from Durham Prison, Ruffell pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary.

In a victim personal statement, the female householder said that the ordeal had left her ‘scared and shaken.’

The court heard that Ruffell has 31 previous convictions dating back to 2004.

These included offences of shoplifting, criminal damage and burglary.

Ruffell, of Whitehead Street, South Shields, was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Passing sentence, Judge Penny Moreland said: 'In drink you blundered into the home of a family.

'You left as soon as you were confronted, but it is a very serious matter.

'Your position is aggravated by your previous convictions, by the fact that there was a child in the house that night and that you were drunk.'
