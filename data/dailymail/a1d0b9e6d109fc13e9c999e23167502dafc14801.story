Pope Francis I has been accused of turning his back on a family who lost five relatives to the military junta during Argentina's Dirty War.

The De la Cuadra family appealed to the Jesuit leader in Rome for help when the relatives disappeared, including pregnant Elena De la Cuadra who was kidnapped and killed in 1977.

The leader urged then head of the Argentinian Jesuits and now Pope Francis, Jose Mario Bergoglio, to help them and in turn he appointed a monsignor, Mario Picchi, to investigate.

After several months the monsignor passed a written note from a military colonel to the family informing them that Elena had given birth in captivity but the baby girl had been adopted.

According to the family, the note allegedly said that the girl, who the family named Ana, had been given to a family that was 'too important' for the adoption to be reversed.

Despite the existence of the note in a case he was said to be personally involved in, Bergoglio testified in 2010 that he was unaware that any babies had been 'stolen' until well after the end of the dictatorship.

It is unclear whether the note was ever seen by the now Pope.

Estela de la Cuadra, whose mother Alicia co-founded the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1977 in hopes of identifying the stolen babies, said: 'Bergoglio has a very cowardly attitude when it comes to something so terrible as the theft of babies.

'He says he didn’t know anything about it until 1985.

'He doesn’t face this reality and it doesn’t bother him.

'The question is how to save his name, save himself. But he can’t keep these allegations from reaching the public. The people know how he is.'

She told Brazilian newspaper O Globo: 'The Catholic Church has chosen a person who for us, families of the victims of repression exercised by the military, was complicit in a genocidal government.'

The new Pope has already been accused in some quarters of failing to stand up to the junta with critics claiming that Jorge Mario Bergoglio did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right-wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left-wing opponents of the generals.

He has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own Jesuit priests, something he strongly denies.

The family of a priest kidnapped and tortured with the alleged complicity of the new Pope also described his election as 'a black day' in an emotional tweet.

Pope Francis has been accused of failing to prevent the five-month ordeal priests Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics underwent in 1976.

The two priests were kidnapped and tortured at a military prison in Buenos Aires before being drugged, blindfolded and dumped in a field.

Angela Lerena, an Argentine journalist and relative of Father Orlando, described the election of Pope Francis as 'a black day' for her family in a tweet.

Ms Lerena, who is married to Father Orlando's nephew, added: 'There is a family who have been waiting for 35 years for justice. Today I spoke in their name.'

The two priests were seized after being branded dissidents for their work with the poor in Buenos Aires.

Investigative journalist Horacio Verbitsky has published a book called The Silence accusing Bergoglio of being complicit in the kidnappings.

It claims he withdrew support for the two priests' work, effectively handing them over to the death squads.

Father Orlando died from natural 
causes in 2000 and Father Francisco has refused to speak about his 
ordeal since moving to a German monastery.

But Father Orlando's brother Rodolfo and sister Graciela have both accused the new Pope of failing to stop the torture.

Rodolfo said in a 2010 interview: 'As
the person in charge he should have protected them from the rumours, 
from the false charges that ended with their illegal arrests.'

Bergoglio was called to give evidence at a 2010 hearing into the atrocities carried out at the military prison.

He had reportedly refused to testify 
on two previous occasions, and lawyers said he was evasive while 
eventually giving his account.

But he has since vigorously denied the accusations, describing them as 'an old slander'.

He claims he instructed the two 
priests to give up their work in the slums for their own safety, and 
that he worked behind-the-scenes to ensure their release.

He recently told Clarin newspaper: 'I did what I could with the age and little influence I had.'

Argentine human rights lawyer Myriam 
Bregman said that church leaders knew what was happening in the Dirty 
War, yet backed the regime. ‘The dictatorship could not have operated 
this way without this key support,’ she said.

Jorge Videla

Now commonly known as the Dirty War, or the Guerra Sucia in Spanish, the Argentinian Process of National Reorganisation saw the country under the rule of a harsh military junta between 1976 and 1983.

After the death of the controversial President Juan Peron in 1974, his wife and vice president, Isabel Peron, took power.

She was not very strong politically and a military junta led a coup against her and removed her from office.

The junta maintained its grip on power by cracking down on anybody whom they believed was challenging their authority

Led for much of the period by Jorge Videla, the junta oversaw a period of state terrorism and counter guerrilla warfare which saw between 10,000 and 30,000 people killed or 'disappear'.

Many of them are said to have been taken to secret government detention centres where they were tortured and killed.

The 'war' was the junta's attempt to quash leftist activists who called for a socialist government.

Among the most harrowing aspects of the so-called war was the disappearance of an estimated 500 babies.

During the period, the Catholic Church was largely seen to support the military led government.

Basic civil liberties were restored and a ban on political parties lifted after Argentina lost the war with Britain over the Falklands in 1982 and Raul Alfonsin's civilian government eventually took over in December 1983.

But the new Pope is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military.

They
say that he does not speak out against the allegation because of his 
humility and the fact that he does not want to sink to his critics' 
level.

They claim that Francis I took 
major risks to save so-called 'subversives' during the 1976-1983 
dictatorship, but never spoke about it publicly before his 2010 
biography The Jesuit.

In the book, Bergoglio explained that he didn’t want to stoop to his critics’ level - and then shared some of his stories.

He said he once passed his Argentine 
identity papers to a wanted man with a similar appearance, enabling him 
to escape over the border to Brazil, and added that many times he 
sheltered people inside church properties before they were safely 
delivered into exile.

Under Bergoglio’s leadership, 
Argentina’s bishops also issued a collective apology in October 2012 for
the church’s failures to protect its flock during the dictatorship, but
the statement blamed the era’s violence in roughly equal measure on 
both the junta and its enemies.

The period became a by-word for 
brutality, with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of 
loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such 
as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes.

Liberal
critics point to Bergoglio’s refusal to give evidence in open court on 
the events of the 1970s until 2010, when his answers were considered 
evasive by some.
