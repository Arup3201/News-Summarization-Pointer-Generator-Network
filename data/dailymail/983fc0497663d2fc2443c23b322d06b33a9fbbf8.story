The billionaire owner of the Indianapolis Colts has been fined $500,000 and suspended for six games by the National Football League after pleading guilty today to driving under the influence of prescription drugs. 

Jim Irsay was sentenced to one year of probation by a judge in Hamilton County, Indiana, and must undergo random drug tests. 

Police arrested him near his home in Carmel, Indiana, in March after pulling him over when they spotted his car swerving in the road. 

According to a police report, he was so high on oxycodone and hydrocodone that he fell over when he tried to stand and could not recite the alphabet - telling a cop that I-N-G came after the letter Z.

Officers also found numerous bottles of prescription pills and $29,000 cash stuffed into a leather briefcase and a laundry bag. 

The 55-year-old NFL was initially charged with four counts of possession of a controlled substance, felonies that carry up to three years in prison each. However, Hamilton County prosecutors eventually dropped those charges and pursued a single count of driving while intoxicated.

Andre Miksha, chief deputy prosecutor for Hamilton County, said after months of investigation, authorities determined that Irsay had a prescription for all the pills cops found in his car. 

Irsay, worth an estimated $1.6billion, was today sentenced to one year of probation. He must stay away from drugs and alcohol and will be drug tested during his probation. He will also have to attend a 'victim impact panel' about the dangers of drunk driving. 

After Irsay entered his guilty plea, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Irsay would be suspended for six games and fined a half million dollars. 

'I have stated on numerous occasions that owners, management personnel and coaches must be held to a higher standard than players,' Goodell said in a statement. 

Irsay also issued a statement after the ruling, calling his addiction to prescription pills 'a disease' that must be treated by 'understanding, committed hard work, and spiritual growth.'

'I acknowledge the mistake I made last March and stand responsible for the consequences of that mistake, for which I sincerely apologize to our community and to Colts fans everywhere,' he said. 

Shortly after his arrest, Irsay left Indiana for a stay at an in-patient drug treatment facility, the Indianapolis Star reports. 

During his suspension, Irsay may not visit the stadium or any other Colts facility, he is not allowed to attend practices or games and may not promote or represent the team on social media or at events.
