Former astronaut Neil Armstrong - the first man to set foot on the moon - is recovering from heart-bypass surgery, according to a Nasa statement.

Armstrong, who turned 82 on Sunday, underwent surgery on Tuesday to relieve blocked coronary arteries.

NBC news quoted his wife Carol Armstrong as saying he is 'doing great'.

Nasa administrator Charles Bolden called Armstrong a 'true American hero' and wished him a quick recovery.

In a statement Mr Bolden said: 'Neil's
pioneering spirit will surely serve him well in this challenging time 
and the entire Nasa family is holding the Armstrong family in our 
thoughts and prayers.'

Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin, who accompanied Armstrong on his 'moonwalk' - and whose portrait on the lunar surface (taken by Armstrong) is one of the most iconic images of human endeavour - also wished his old mission commander well on Twitter.

He tweeted: 'Sending my best wishes for a speedy 
recovery - we agreed to make it to the 50th Apollo Anniv in 2019.'

Armstrong and Aldrin were joined in the Apollo mission by Michael Collins, who became the first person to orbit the moon alone until his colleagues returned from the surface.

As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969.

After piloting the lunar module Eagle
down to the surface from the command module, he climbed down the stairs
onto the dusty surface and delivered one of the most quotable quotes in
human history: 'That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.'

Both
Armstrong and Nasa insist that the quote was not preplanned or 
rehearsed - Armstrong says it came from a train of thought he had 
developed after the launch from earth and the six hours on the lunar surface
before his historic Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA).

Ever since the moon landing, academics and enthusiasts have argued over the missing 'a' in the quote. Armstrong can be heard to say 'That's one small step for man...' when he should have said 'That's one small step for a man...'.

Dangerous training: Armstrong piloting a lunar landing simulator ahead of his Apollo mission. A year before the moon landing, Armstrong was nearly killed in a simulator accident and had to eject to safety

The main event: Armstrong and Aldrin place the U.S. flag at their Apollo 11 landing site on July 20, 1969. Armstrong's announcement as he was stepping down the ladder is one of the world's most quotable quotes

Without the 'a' the quote is contradictory - a small step for man, a giant leap for man.

While Armstrong insists he did say 
the 'a' - and supporters suggest that poor telecommunications technology
meant that the important utterance was lost in transmission - others 
say Armstrong simply made a mistake while being overwhelmed by his 
situation.

Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins successfully returned to earth safely following eight days in space.

Before he became an astronaut, Armstrong was
in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. He joined the Nasa 
Astronaut Corps in 1962 and his first spaceflight was the Nasa Gemini 8 
mission in 1966.

His second and last spaceflight was as the mission commander of Apollo 11. It could have been very different, after Armstrong was almost killed in 1968 when his lunar lander simulator - a clunky rocket-propelled vehicle designed to mimic moon langing conditions in the earth's gravity - malfunctioned.

He was forced to eject and his parachute descent almost landed him in the middle of the simulator's fiery wreckage.

During the launch phase of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong's heart was recorded at beating at 110 beats per minute.

After leaving the space agency, he 
taught at the University of Cincinnati in his home state of Ohio. But it
wasn't the last time Armstrong would be connected to space flight.

He was twice appointed to Nasa 
accident investigation teams: first, as a panel expert investigation the
ill-fated Apollo 13 moon mission in 1970; second, as vice-chairman of 
the commission investigating the tragic Challenger Space Shuttle 
disaster in 1986.Â 

in 1991 he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing in Aspen, Colorado.

He and his wife live in the Cincinnati area.
