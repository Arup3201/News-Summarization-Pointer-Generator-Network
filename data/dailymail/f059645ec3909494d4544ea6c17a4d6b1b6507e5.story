A Georgia community has rallied around a Vietnam veteran who has been living out of his minivan with his dog for more than a year after being evicted from his home by mortgage giant Freddie Mac.

John Chambers, 65, lost his house in Victory Park, Marietta, in January 2013 and has lived in a Walmart parking lot since, with his seven-year-old border collie Scout.

Chambers says he was evicted without warning, lost his job after his employer learned he was homeless and has had trouble finding alternative housing through the Veterans Administration.

Chambers is a former architectural draftsman who served in Vietnam and helped build facilities for U.S. troops in Iraq as a private contractor.

The veteran's home is now owned by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., also known as Freddie Mac. Chambers sued the corporation, claiming that he was wrongfully evicted without proper notice and was led to believe he was being placed in a loan modification program.

Freddie Mac spokesman, Brad German, says the corporation doesn't comment on pending litigation.

Local paper the Marietta Daily Journal published a story about Chambers' situation earlier this week as he prepared to spend another night in his van while the region was hit with sub-freezing temperatures and wind chills. Since then, hundreds of people have offered money, temporary shelter and food for his dog, Scout, he said.

'I'm so overwhelmed I really don't know what to say,' Chambers told the newspaper before checking into an extended stay hotel room being paid for by the American Legion Post 29 in Marietta.'Tons of people have come out to the car, dropping off food, cards, asking how they can help, telling me I could stay the night in their house. This is surreal. I don't want to be in the limelight, really. I'm a little uncomfortable by it. But it humbles me. People coming by, giving me money, giving me groceries. People have been coming out of the woodwork all day,' he said.

When he was evicted, Chambers approached a homeless shelter with Scout, but the facility did not accept dogs. So he chose to stay in his minivan with his beloved dog. The Veterans Administration was less than helpful.“They said they were going to try and find me some housing. I drove to East Point, and when I got there they said they didn’t have any housing,” he said. “I asked ‘Why did you make me drive all the way from Marietta to East Point when you could have told me that over the phone?’ And she said, ‘Oh, I didn’t want to but my supervisor told me to do it.’” Chambers told the Marietta Daily Journal.Chambers told the Marietta Daily Journal that at least 100 people have come to visit him in his minivan since the story was published, bringing cards, cash, dog food and offers of accommodation.

The service officer for Post 29 of the American Legion, Ken Buechel, said the group's goal is to help Chambers find a new job and get back on his feet. Metro Atlanta real estate agent, Melody Unger, and her attorney have also formed a nonprofit group to try saving Chambers' home.'She's trying to get investors to actually buy my house, which would be my best bet because I'd like to drop this lawsuit like a hot potato,' Chamber said. He's spent more than $22,000 in legal fees trying to save his house, which is worth about $50,000.Unger said she contacted her attorney, Elizabeth Cook, and shared the story with her. The two women have now formed a nonprofit organization, JRC Home Fund Inc., to which people can donate money to help save Chambers’ home.

“If we can just get 100 people to donate $500 I feel like we could probably get the house for $50,000,” Unger said.Despite falling on hard times and facing uncertainty, Chambers said the outpouring of support has rekindled his optimism.'I was getting into a bitter state but it's a whole new world out there and I have a new life because of this,' he said. 'Just to have found one person in this world like all of the ones I've run into so far would have been enough to change my outlook. And here I've found more than a hundred.'
