A former Delaware pediatrician defended himself in court yesterday where he's accused of waterboarding his longtime companion's daughter by holding the girl's head under a faucet.

Melvin Morse, 60, will be cross-examined by prosecutors today in his trial on endangerment and assault charges. He testified Monday that he was simply trying to get the girl's hair clean.

He told the court that he and the girl's mother, Pauline Morse, became exasperated trying to wash the girl's hair in the shower when she was 8-years-old after she insisted she was too old to take a bath.

The girl, now 12, and her mother have said Morse used hair-washing as a threat or punishment when she misbehaved.

Morse, who became household name in the
 1990s through appearances on 'Larry King Live,' 'The Oprah Winfrey 
Show' and 'Unsolved Mysteries,' and his research into near-death experiences
 with children, could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted on all charges.

Morse denied police claims that he may have been experimenting on the girl for his research.

Monday
 was the eighth day of Morse's trial and he took the stand to explain 
how he cared for the girl, who he said had faced difficulties in her 
young life.

He denied he treated the girl any different from her younger sister, who was biologically his child. For instance, he said, he made sure to give them the same number of Christmas presents.

According to DelawareOnline, he described the alleged victim as 'a burst of sunshine' up until age 5.

However, Morse said she changed after she experienced sexual abuse at the hands of her stepsister, which was discovered in 2007.

'She became defiant,' he said. 'She was, naturally, angry at us for not protecting her.'

He
 denied water-boarding the girl, claiming that he was simply trying to 
wash her hair after she declared she was too old for baths.

'It
 pretty much was always a thrash,' he said of Pauline Morse's efforts to
 wash the girl's hair and admitted trying to rinse the girl's hair under
 a faucet on four or five occasions.

'I
 did say to her, "I'm not waterboarding you, this isn't some kind of 
torture. I just want your hair to be clean."' Morse testified, according
 to Delaware Online.

When the girl testified last week, she claimed Morse forced her under running water as a punishment
 whenever he felt like it. She eventually ran away front the home in 
July 2012 and told police she'd been abused, which led to the arrests of
 both parents.

Morse added that he still considers himself a doctor and is 'determined to go back to full-time practice.'

The testimony comes after the former
 pediatrician's wife testified Thursday about the extensive abuse she 
believes took place in their home and her reluctance to put a stop to 
it.

Pauline Morse said she 
saw Morse holding the girl's head under a faucet one day and doesn't 
believe his claims of washing her hair.

She also told the Delaware jury of him dragging her across a gravel driveway by her ankle and down the stairs of their home.

Pauline Morse testified that she 
walked into the kitchen one time and surprised Morse while he had the 
now 12-year-old girl's head under the faucet. She said he jumped and 
quickly released the girl, who was coughing and shaking. 

'He called it washing her hair, but I knew it wasn't washing her hair because there was no soap or anything,' she recalled. 

He would routinely use 'hair washing' as a threat or punishment for the girl, she continued.

'He would just say "I'm going to wash your hair," and he would say "I will do it again,"'  she testified.

She
 pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor child endangerment charges for 
doing nothing to stop the several instances of abuse she says she either
 saw or heard.

'A lot of times I would just go up in my room and ignore the whole thing,' she said, adding that she was afraid of 'undermining' him.

Melvin Morse made the girl stand with her arms outstretched for long periods of time, she said. She was awoken several times to hear bumping and crying she assumed was him dragging her down the stairs, but said she stayed in bed.

'I didn't want to see.'

The waterboarding claims came from the girl after Melvin Morse was accused in July 2012 of grabbing the girl by her ankle and dragging her across a gravel driveway - for which he was arrested and released on bail.

The then-11-year-old girl told investigators about the waterboarding when they questioned her about the initial dragging incident, she said the torture happened at least four times, according to Reuters.

Pauline Morse also told the jury he would starve the girl and deprive of her of using the bathroom.

Morse shot into the national consciousness through a series of books and articles on paranormal science and near-death experiences involving children. 

Those writings led to appearances on 'Larry King Live' and the 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' 'Unsolved Mysteries' and in an article in 'Rolling Stone' magazine. 

A pediatrician by trade, his license to practice medicine was suspended after he was charged despite denying police claims that he may have been experimenting on the girl. Waterboarding simulates drowning and has been used in the past by U.S. interrogators on terror suspects. Many critics call it torture.

If convicted on each of four felony counts of reckless endangering, Morse could face up to 20 years in prison, but the presumptive sentence for each count is up to 15 months in prison. He faces up to a year in prison for each of five misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and up to a year on one misdemeanor assault charge. 

The girl admitted under cross-examination Wednesday that she had lied in 2010 when she accused a family member of molesting her, WBOC reported.

Pauline Morse testified that her husband had violated a no-contact after his arrest by making calendar entries with messages on his cellphone, which was synched to hers because they shared the same account. 

One message presented by prosecutors reads: 'I have repented and I am suffering my own created hell.' 

She said they also discussed ways of covering the abuse up when he was home on bail.

Pauline Morse said her motivations for testifying against Melvin Morse included hoping to be reunited with the girl and her younger sister, who are now in foster care, and because she wanted him 'out of our life.'
