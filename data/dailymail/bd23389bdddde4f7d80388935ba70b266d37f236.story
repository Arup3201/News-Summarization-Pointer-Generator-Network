Harris, who works for Falcon School District 49, was arrested last week after authorities were alerted to the alleged assault last November.Â 

It is reported to have involved a teenage boy and another 20-year-old man, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette.

Harris is being at the El Paso County jail on two felony counts,  sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, according to the sheriff's office.

The incident was first brought to police in February but there was lack of evidence to make an arrest.

A call to a confidential tip line led to Harris's arrest.

She is being held in lieu of $3,000 bail.
