Petrol prices have fallen to a four-year low after big name supermarkets move to slash costs to win back customers.

Latest figures show that on Monday unleaded petrol cost 126.78p, down 2p in just a week and the lowest since January 2011.

The drop is thanks to retailers passing on falls in the cost of oil, but motoring groups warn the good news could be short-lived with rises expected this winter.

Latest figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change reveal petrol prices fell by 2p in a week

Since July the price of petrol has fallen by almost 5p, including a 2p drop in the last week.

At the end of September Sainsbury's announced a 5p cut across its 294 forecourts. Avishai Moor, Sainsbury's Head of Fuel, said: Fuel is a big part of the weekly budget for many households, which is why we're taking the lead and cutting the price of unleaded petrol and diesel by up to 5 pence per litre.'

Asda and Tesco followed suit with big cuts, with Tesco fuel director Peter Cattell declaring: 'As Britain's biggest fuel retailer this means more motorists can make real savings.'

The moves by the big name supermarkets came as they faced renewed pressure from budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl.

The latest drops have been triggered by Sainsbury's cutting prices by 5p, leading other retailers to follow suit

Independent petrol stations have also moved to cut prices to compete with the supermarkets, who traditionally have been cheapest for drivers.

On September 29, the average cost of a litre of petrol was 128.59p but by this week it had fallen to 126.78p, according to official figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change.

The price for diesel was 131.4p per litre, this is also 1.8p per litre lower than the previous week.

The last time fuel was so cheap was in the first week of January 2011 when it stood at 124.85p and diesel was 129.11p.

Edmund King, AA president, said it was great news that pump prices are falling

Edmund King, AA president, said: 'It is great news that we are seeing pump prices falling. The main reason for the drop in prices is the global supply and demand. 

'To put it crudely we are swimming in oil. US oil output has doubled in the last six years and is running at its highest production levels for a quarter of a century. However, global demand has declined particularly as the Asian economies cool down.

'In the UK the reductions we are seeing at the pumps have also been speeded up by competing supermarket offers of discounts of up to 5p litre. 

'Drivers haven't seen such prices since 2011 but oil prices are still volatile and more global unrest in oil producing countries can just as easily send the price spiralling again. Enjoy it while we can.' 

Petrol retailers had been accused of failing to pass on savings from a dramatic fall in oil prices to motorists.

Fears over the spluttering global economy has caused oil prices to fall by more than 16 per cent since early June from $109.13 (£67.98) to $91.48 (£56.99) a barrel.

This is enabling retailers, including supermarket giants Tesco and Sainsbury as well as Shell and BP, to make bigger profits on Britain’s forecourts as they can buy fuel on the wholesale markets more cheaply while cutting prices more gradually for customers. 

Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: 'Motorists struggling with the cost of living crisis have been hit hard by the government hiking VAT on petrol and by retailers who are sluggish at passing on falls in global oil prices. 

'Lower petrol prices are good news but the government needs to do more to ensure that oil companies are passing on price fall savings in full.'
