Four home corners in quick succession, the injustice of a booking for crowd favourite Lee Cattermole and Angel Rangel’s soft dismissal - that was as exciting as it got on an arduous afternoon at the Stadium of Light.

There was the odd half-chance – Black Cats striker Connor Wickham heading over late on – but this sour stalemate is surely a certainty to close Match of the Day.

For Sunderland, their wait for a first Premier League win of the season will extend to match number seven at home to Stoke next weekend.

Swansea, meanwhile, may reflect on a point well earned after seeing out the final 10 minutes with 10 men, but they had shown zero ambition to emerge with anything more than a bore draw.

It means Garry Monk’s men have now drawn a blank in their last two in the league and the early-season promise which saw them shoot to second on the back of three wins has somewhat faded.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet said that the outcome of back-to-back home games would tell him a lot about the campaign ahead. If this offered up any clues then it’s that boredom lies in wait. 

The start was ominously slow. Nathan Dyer lashed wide as the Swans, working the winger into a position of promise on the edge of the area, threatened to break the early tedium.

At the other end Adam Johnson defied a narrow angle to take aim for the near post and Lukasz Fabianski was worried enough to scramble and shovel around his upright.

Former Sunderland loanee Ki Sung Yueng remains a popular figure in these parts but his favour almost tumbled when he fashioned space for a shot before driving narrowly over the crossbar from 18 yards.

The hosts’ best bet for a goal was in snaffling the second balls from set-pieces and Lee Cattermole hammered back into a crowd of bodies inside the six-yard area after running on to a half-cleared corner.

Just seconds later defender Santiago Vergini – still lurking from the subsequent flag-kick – flashed a header on goal only for Fabianski to dive and flip around the post. 

The in-form Cattermole was bossing the centre of the park – strengthening his claims for an England call – but he was unfortunate to enter the book when sliding to dispossess Gylfi Sigurdsson on the stroke of half-time, the midfielder’s reputation perhaps offering reason for the harsh yellow.

The injustice stirred the crowd from their slumber after what had been a low-key opening half.

A feisty first-half was punctuated by a number of crunching challenges from players on both sides, including this attempt to win the ball by Swansea's Nathan Dyer

The former Middlesbrough midfielder has shown a taste for shooting from distance in recent weeks and one of his efforts flew just wide midway through the first half

The second started at much the same pedestrian pace and it took a stinging shot from 20 yards from Sigurdsson – swallowed by Vito Mannone – to spark the contest in to life.

Seb Larsson tried to his best to inject some zest in to the home side’s laboured offensive effort but a purposeful burst to the by-line and laced centre was seized by Fabianski. 

Home winger Will Buckley opted for a similar tactic from the opposite flank but his low pull-back zipped through the six-yard area without any takers.

But the best chance came the way of lone striker Wickham on 74 minutes. Larsson landed an inch-perfect delivery on his unmarked brow but the 21-year-old could only nod tamely over from six yards.

Rangel then collected his first booking for tossing the ball away at a throw-in – a soft caution if ever there was one – and his second came soon after following a clumsy block on Buckley. Larsson tested Fabianski from the resulting free-kick but the Pole was never going to be beaten.

Substitute Steven Fletcher then rose to nod inches wide as Poyet’s side pressed for a breakthrough.

But goalless was how it eventually expired – and that was a fitting finale.

Poyet clearly wanted more from his Sunderland side towards the end of the first half but they continued to find their way to goal blocked by a disciplined Swansea side
