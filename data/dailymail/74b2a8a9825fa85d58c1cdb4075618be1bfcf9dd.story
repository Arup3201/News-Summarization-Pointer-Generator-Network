At 2:54 p.m, just five minutes after a moment of silence was held, CNN's coverage showed the memorial scene live from near the finish line of the marathon on Boylston Street. Vice President Joe Biden was in attendance, as was Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.

The coverage at the time was being broadcast without anchor commentary, although background noise, including the sound of bagpipes, can be heard. All of a sudden, a man can be heard saying, 'It sounded good? I didn't know I was going to get stranded there.'

An open mic captured a man using the f-word on CNN's live coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings anniversary

The man then mentions something about being in a camera shot and says, 'I was like, f***!'

The live feed — with the f-word — was also used by local by local Boston television station, according to Deadspin.
