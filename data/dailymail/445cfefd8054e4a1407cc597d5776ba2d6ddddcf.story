Seven years ago it was a decision which would change the face of one part of London forever.

The successful bid for the London 2012 Games in July 2005 initiated a frantic and expensive plan to completely transform Stratford, east London into a vast athletics complex capable of hosting the world.

And as these pictures show, the current Olympic site has gone from dusty wasteland to gleaming landmark during one of most ambitious building projects ever seen on British shores.

Run down: The barren wasteland in Stratford, East London, before building work started on the new Olympic Stadium

The very first stage: Architect Rod Sheard with the model of the Olympic Stadium that he designed

Unrecognisable: An aerial image from 2006 shows the scale of the job 
ahead for Olympic planners, as they prepared to change the Stratford 
skyline by 2012

Foundations laid: By 2008, the giant circular hole for the Olympic Stadium is clearly visible as the first signs of a venue take shape

Taking shape: In November 2008, the base of the Olympic Stadium was in place and huge steel structures were in position to form the rest of the arena

Working progress: The first section of the roof support for the Olympic stadium is erected in early 2009

Towering high: April 2009, and the form of the Olympic Stadium, with its giant side beams, is beginning to dominate the Stratford skyline

Aerial images from 2005 show the extent of the task facing architects, engineers and Games planners, when a huge expanse of land in Stratford was put aside for the Olympic Park.

Pictures charting the development of the site show how the facilities and infrastructure have gradually risen from the ground, including the spectacular Olympic Stadium, Velodrome Arena, Aquatics Centre and Westfield Shopping Centre.

Even in 2001, years before London won the bid, what is now the Olympic site was a desolate, unloved barren wasteland ripe for redevelopment.

Getting closer: With just over two years to go, this shot from May 2010 shows how the stadium and velodrome are almost completely finished, with attention turning to the surrounding park

Almost there: In June last year the park was almost completely finished, with extra pathways, tarmac around the stadium and the giant red ArcelorMittal Orbit structure the noticeable additions

Finished article: The now gleaming Olympic Park, along with the new basketball arena, velodrome (both top right) and athlete's village (right) sits ready to welcome the world

Ready to shine: The £550m Olympic Stadium will be the setting for tonight's spectacular Opening Ceremony

The £550 Olympic Stadium can hold 80,000 people, with its makers claiming the arena is the lightest Olympic stadium ever built.

The waved roof of the stunning Aquatics centre, meanwhile, measures 12,000 square metres - one and a half times bigger than the Wembley Stadium pitch.

The amount of earth excavated in order the built the swimming and diving arena was the equivalent of 160,000 tonnes of soil.

Burgeoning: The next picture, taken by Ordnance 
Survey in May 2008, shows an enormous crater that forms the foundations 
of the Olympic stadium

What a difference a year makes: The Athletics stadium, seen bottom left, starts to emerge in the mapping agency's 2009 picture

Coming on: By 2010 the stadium was well on its 
way to being complete. The Aquatics Centre is just to the stadium's 
right while the Velodrome cycling arena can be seen at the top of the 
picture

Changing landscape: The £550million Olympic 
stadium gleams next to the £105million Velodrome cycling arena, while 
the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre looks over the Aquatics and
Water Polo Centres in this picture from last year
