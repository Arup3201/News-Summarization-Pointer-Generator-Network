The Blue Lagoon star released a heartfelt statement to People magazine. 

The 47-year-old actress, who had a troubled relationship with Teri, who masterminded her daughter's career after launching her into showbiz as a baby, says she wouldn't be who she was today if it wasn't for her mother. 

Heartfelt statement: Brooke Shields has released a statement following the death of her mother Teri Shields, who died at the age of 79, following 'a long illness'

'My mother was an enormous part of my life and of who I am today," Brooke said in a statement to People magazine.

'I loved her, laughed with her, and respected her. And although she had her share of struggles, she was my mom.'

Brooke and her mother had a troubled relationship, eventually becoming estranged due to Teri's 'iron fist' approach to her daughter's career and resentment that Brooke wanted to be independent of her.

Teri's approach to her daughter's career was heavily criticised, and she was accused of exploiting Brooke during her early years.

She first signed on her daughter, whom she once described as looking like a 'beautiful doll', to pose for an Ivory Soap ad at just 11 months. 

It launched a child modelling career that would include campaigns for Breck, Band-Aids and Colgate.

Teri famously raised eyebrows when she allowed her then 11-year-old to be cast as a child prostitute in 1978's Pretty Baby.

The controversial period piece was set
in a New Orleans bordello and Brooke had a nude scene and filmed scenes
in which her character lost her virginity.

Teri also arranged for a photographer to take naked pictures of Brooke when she was 10.

A few years later, she permitted 15-year-old Brooke to famously star in a series of commercials for 
Calvin Klein jeans, provocatively professing that nothing comes between 
'me and my Calvins.'

Defending her decision to allow Brooke 
to star in Pretty Baby, Teri told an American TV show a few years 
after its release: 'They see total innocence, which is totally there.

'And two, they have the sexy child too, they have the sexy person - that appeals to them.'

In the same interview Shields also said that people who accused her of exploiting her child were jealous. 

For her part, Brooke said at the time: 'It's only a role. I'm not going to grow up and be a prostitute.'

The Blue Lagoon star's bond with Teri showed strain early on.

In an article written on the pair when Brooke was 12, People magazine wrote: 'Occasionally the intimacy between mother and daughter turns into anger.

It reported that Brooke complained: 
"Oh, Mommy, you're so dumb!" to which Teri snapped back, "I don't have 
to take that crap!" before storming out of the room.

The relationship became even more tense when Brooke hit her twenties and wanted to 
start taking control of her own affairs.

They parted professionally in 1995, with Brooke describing the move as 'the hardest thing.'

She told Rolling Stone the following year that 'something didn't feel right.'

'I had hopes and dreams, and I wasn't 
doing anything to go toward them,' she said.

'The focus was on creating a
persona rather than a talent.'

Proud:

Shields reflected in 1996 that she was proud of her daughter for taking control of her life and career.

'I felt that she had to be on her own.
It kills me once in a while. I would like to get over it,' she said in 
an interview on TV's Extra. 

'I would love for Brooke to be my best friend, but you can't because I am her mother and she is my daughter.'

In mid-Nineties Brooke accused her mother of being an alcoholic.

She told the New York Times: 'I grew 
up in an alcoholic household. I’m the caretaker who wants to make 
everything better, and you can just do that for so long, or so I’ve been
told.'

But eventually their relationship thawed and by the time of Teri's death the two were long reconciled.

Theresa Anna Lillian Shields, nee Schmon, was born on August 11, 1933, in Newark.

She passed away in Manhattan, New York, last Wednesday,  according to Jill Fritzo, a spokeswoman for her daughter.

The New York Times reported the elder Shields died following a long illness related to dementia.

Shields worked as a hairstylist, a make-up artist for Lord & Taylor and a model.

She married Francis Alexander Shields in 1964, who was  23 to her 30, and Brooke was born the next year.

The pair divorced a when Brooke was just a few months old.

Shields is survived by a sister and two granddaughters.
