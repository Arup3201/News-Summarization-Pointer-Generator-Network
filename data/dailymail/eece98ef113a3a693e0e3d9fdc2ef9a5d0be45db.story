A British team toiling beneath Antarctica's midnight sun to drill down to a lake buried beneath two miles of ice have had their attempts frustratingly delayed by malfunctions.

Twelve scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have worked around the clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice-locked Lake Ellsworth to collect samples of water and sediment.

They hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer.

The malfunction could mean that the project, which took 16 years to plan, would have to be abandoned

The team had hoped to penetrate the thick ice cap to reach the lake today, but technical difficulties have knocked them off schedule, pitting them in a race against time to complete the mission before their equipment freezes.

The BAS team have been trying to melt their way down to Ellsworth using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch.

However, when the scientists fired up their boiler's primary burner for the first time its controller circuit failed.

A secondary burner was fitted and the team worked around the clock to shovel snow to feed the hot-water drill, and in four days they had melted enough to begin drilling the borehole to the cavity.

The 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt

But then, on Saturday afternoon, this secondary burner failed leaving the BAS team with nothing to do but wait for a replacement part as their bore hole - and equipment - slowly begins to freeze shut.

'We are now committed, having gone past the point of no return,' expedition leader Chris Hill told the Independent. 'If anything stops working now, water could freeze in the pipes and the whole programme could come to a halt.'

Drilling preparations for the team, who admit that they only have one more chance to complete the project

The £7million project to drill beneath two miles of Antarctic ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure.

The BAS reports that the replacement components will be with the deep field team in a few days time. They will work with the manufacturers to make sure they install them properly.

But if the replacement parts malfunction malfunction again the team will have no option other than to by pass the circuitry and manually 'drive' the burner - an operation that will require skill and a light touch.

For Queen and country: The mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent

One of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes
in Antarctica, Ellsworth is equivalent in size to the UK's Lake 
Windermere, measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and nearly 500ft
deep.

Completely cut off from any light from
the Sun, any life lurking beneath its waters must endure complete 
darkness, intense pressure and subzero temperatures.

It is only geothermal heat from the 
Earth's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice 
above that has kept it liquid.

Should any organisms be found living 
in its icy depths, they could offer tantalising clues as to how life 
might look elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the ice-covered 
oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa.

Expedition leader Chris Hill confirmed they were past the point of no return and feared the water would re-freeze in the pipes and borehole, halting the programme.

The BAS team planned first to bore 
down to 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second 
borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way 
down to the lake.

The cavity is what controls the 
pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of 
prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and 
spilling out over the surface of the ice.

Once they reach the waters, they will 
have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense UV
light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before 
the hole refreezes again.

Technology: The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch

Lake Ellsworth is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the Antarctic: Equivalent in size to the UK's Lake Windermere, it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and is nearly 500ft deep

Chris Hill, a British Antarctic Survey
engineer who is heading the programme, spoke earlier this month to the 
Guardian by phone from his tent on the West Antarctic ice sheet.

'It's bloody cold,' he said.

The team will spent six weeks at the 
site, where temperatures, according to the BAS, are -25C, with winds of 
20 knots. For much of that time they will work around the clock.'

Lake Ellsworth Principal Investigator 
Martin Siegert from the University of Bristol said: 'This British 
mission is part of an international effort to discover and explore 
subglacial lake environments. 

Team effort: The 12-man team have been working around the clock to shovel snow to feed their hot-water drill - until the boiler frustratingly malfunctioned

Inhospitable: The team have been battling against freezing cold weather to complete their mission

Ambitious: Intrepid engineers and scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have been trying to drill two miles to an ice-locked lake deep beneath the glaciers of the western Antarctic

'We are about to explore the unknown 
and I am very excited that our mission will advance our scientific 
understanding of Antarctica’s hidden world. 

'Right now we are working round the 
clock in a cold, demanding and extreme location – it’s testing our own 
personal endurance, but it is entirely worth it.

'The technical difficulties are something that are not unfamiliar in Antarctica - it's a hostile environment and very difficult to do things smoothly.

'The good news is that we found the fault relatively early on in our deployment system and so we have quite a lot of fuel that is left remaining.

'If we didn't have that of course we wouldn't be able to continue any further.'
