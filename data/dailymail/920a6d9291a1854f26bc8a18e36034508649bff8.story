Criminal history: Israel Alverez, 33, was arrested for family violence on September 11 and now police believe he shot his family before killing himself

Police have revealed that a Texas mother was the one to kill herself, her husband and their three young children and not her abusive husband as initially suspected.

On Tuesday the Navarro County Sheriff's office announced that it was Guadalupe Ronquillo-Ovalle who shot dead her husband Israel Alvarez and their children on Thursday in their home in Rice, a town about 40 miles south of Dallas.

Investigators are still trying to determine why the 33-year-old mother fired the fatal shots.

Alvarez and his sons had all been shot in the upper torso. Tanner said there was no indication that Alvarez fired any shots.

He was arrested on a domestic assault charge less than two weeks before the family-of-five's bodies were found.

Maria Franco, a family friend, said the couple came to her home on Sept. 16, asking for advice about keeping their relationship together. The couple talked about 'normal problems' they were having, she said.

'I didn't hear anything dangerous,' Franco said.

Alvarez's father was the one to call police on Sunday night and report the slaying inside the family's home.

In an audio recording released Tuesday of a 911 call made by Alvarez's father after he found the bodies, Manuel Alvarez said he thought the deaths were due to suicide from natural gas being left on in the home.

He had to use a ladder to enter the home through a second-story balcony.

Scene: Police found the bodies of Alverez, his wife and their three children with gunshot wounds to their torsos. Investigators also found a rifle in the house

Franco said the couple's 10-year-old 
son was best friends with one of her sons. She had to tell her son that 
his friend was now in heaven.

'I don't want to think about it,' Franco said. 'It breaks my heart.'

Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said a rifle was found at the home.

Investigators
were trying to determine when the shootings took place, Tanner said, 
saying the children, ages 4, 8 and 12, were in school Thursday afternoon
but missed classes Friday.

The police never suspected an outside individual, and always thought that it was an inside job.

'We have not seen anything yet that 
makes us think we need to go outside this location,' Sheriff Tanner said
early into the investigation.

Alvarez
was arrested September 11 on a misdemeanor family violence charge for 
pushing Ronquillo-Ovalle and taking away her phone because he thought 
she was talking to another man, she told deputies.

According to a sheriff's office report released Monday, the woman went to her children's elementary school to call 911 because Alvarez took away her cell phone and removed the battery.

Next step: Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said they are waiting to get the autopsies back to determine when the shootings took place. The children missed school on Friday and their grandfather discovered the bodies on Sunday

She told a deputy that she was on the phone talking to her sister when Alvarez entered the room and pushed her.

Alvarez was charged with family violence assault, a misdemeanor.

He pleaded no contest, paid a $367 fine and was released after spending two days in jail, records show.

No
divorce filings or requests for a restraining order were filed, and 
Ronquillo-Ovalle did not ask for a protective order, according to 
records.

When they got the 
call on Sunday night, police immediately recognized the address of the 
home because of the previous problems that had been reported.

'I don’t care where you are. Any time there’s five losses of lives in one location, that’s shocking and traumatic,' Sheriff Tanner said to the local NBC affiliate at the time.

'It doesn’t make any difference where you are. It’s a horrible, horrible thing to see, witness or be a part of.
