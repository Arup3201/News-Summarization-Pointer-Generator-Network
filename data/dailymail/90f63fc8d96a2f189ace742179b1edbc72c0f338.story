The Queen issued a rare public statement last night to deny claims she had been asked to step in over the Scottish referendum.

Following a report that a number of MPs were suggesting privately that the Monarch, who is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union, should intervene, Buckingham Palace insisted she would remain neutral.

Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, risked controversy yesterday by declaring that he had met the Queen recently at Balmoral and insisting that she would be proud to reign over an independent Scotland.

The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Highland Games in 2011, issued a rare public statement last night to deny claims she had been asked to step in over the Scottish referendum 

But the Palace issued an unusually strongly-worded statement saying that the Queen was above politics and ‘those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case’.

Royal sources made clear that there had been no suggestion from anyone in Government or opposition for the Queen to take a public stand.

A spokesman said: ‘The Sovereign’s constitutional impartiality is an established principle of our democracy and one which the Queen has demonstrated throughout her reign.

‘As such the Monarch is above politics and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case.

‘Any suggestion that the Queen should wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong. This is a matter for the people of Scotland.’

Alistair Darling, the leader of the Better Together campaign, said: ‘The Queen has stayed out of party politics throughout her entire reign and that is one of the many reasons she commands such great respect in Scotland and the rest of the UK.’

Sources have confirmed that the Monarch will be at her private estate in the Highlands, on the day of the referendum on September 18.

The Palace has repeatedly insisted that the Queen is politically neutral, but one well-placed source said at the weekend: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’

In a speech she gave to MPs on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Queen said: ‘I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations.

‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

‘Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’
