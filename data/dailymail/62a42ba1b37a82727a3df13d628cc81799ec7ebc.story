This is the stunning luxury £530,000 home Oscar Pistorius planned to move into with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp until she was shot dead in his bathroom.

Pistorious paid a deposit on the enormous 4-bedroom property after agreeing a nine million rand price with the owner after visiting it with his girlfriend.

The pair had told friends of their plans to move from Pistorius' house in Pretoria to their new home in Johannesburg.

Oscar Pistorius agreed to purchase the luxury Johannesburg property, pictured, for nine million Rand (£530,000) after visiting it with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

The property is located in the prosperous Sandton suburb of Johannesburg and features a massive open-plan living area leading to a wonderful barbecue terrace

The couple had been dating for just four months when she was shot on Valentines Day 2013.

Pistorius had planned to install a state-of-the-art security system in the house which is located in the affluent suburb of Sandton. According to the Daily Telegraph the athlete told friends that he wanted to move into the new home because he was afraid for Ms Steenkamp's safety.

Much of Ms Steenkamp's career was based around Johannesburg and Pistorius was afraid for her safety driving between to his home and work.

A friend said: 'He trained in Pretoria but could do his gym workouts in Johannesburg. They had talked about moving in together and were really excited about it.'

The couple 
had planned to move into the magnificent 8,000 square foot two-storey 
property after Pistorius agreed to buy it in December 2012.

Pistorius
 especially liked the property because of its location at the end of a 
tree-lined road surrounded by high walls and electronically controlled 
security gates.

The property is on half-an-acre of land and even has accommodation for domestic staff.

The grounds had a large pool and gardens with four garages.

Pistorius' trial resumed last week after a lengthy adjournment so the Olympian could undergo intense psychiatric evaluation.

The trial had heard earlier that Steenkamp had spent part of the night she died looking at interior design websites. The couple had intended decorating their new home together.

His trial heard that Pistorius has a 'split personality' with a superstar status in front of the cameras and a private life as a disabled man.

His legal team described said he was acting out of 'morbid fear not anger' when he shot dead his girlfriend.

As the Paralympic star’s lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal team have been at pains to paint a picture of Pistorius as a highly vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every day of his life,  rather than the self-obsessed, gun-toting hothead that the prosecution has portrayed him to be.

Reading from a psychiatric report into Pistorius’ mindset, defence counsel Kenny Oldwadge told Pretoria’s High Court the runner was 'the international superstar more confident and in control' standing six feet tall on his famous carbon blades 'versus the vulnerable and fearful disabled person' barely five feet on his stumps.

Pistorius, 27, is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp by shooting four bullets through a locked toilet door at his home in the South African capital on Valentine’s Day last year during a heated argument.  The double amputee told the court he was convinced she was an intruder and fired his 9mm pistol accidentally out of fear and panic, having gone to investigate noises coming from the cubicle.

Professor Wayne Derman,  who specialises in treating disabled athletes, is the final witness to appear in defence of the sprinter who,  the professor said, in his daily life is a far cry from the image Pistorius shows to the world. 

'Although he loathes to be pitied in any way, the hard truth is that he does not have lower legs.  You’ve got a paradox, of an individual who is supremely able and an individual who is significantly disabled,'  Prof Derman said.

Prof Derman will face a second day of gruelling cross-examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel when the trial resumes on Monday.

Pistorius, whose carbon running prosthetics have earned him the nickname  the ‘Blade Runner’, denies murder and three firearms charges.
