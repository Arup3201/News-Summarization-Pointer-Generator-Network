The long-delayed official report into the Iraq war must be published by the end of the year, David Cameron insisted last night.

In a dramatic intervention that appears to set him at odds with his most senior civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Prime Minister said the public wanted ‘answers’ on the 2003 conflict and ‘shouldn’t have to wait too much longer’.

Whitehall sources said Mr Cameron wanted  an agreement reached quickly between the Cabinet Office and the Iraq inquiry team that would see ‘as much as can sensibly be included’ of the most sensitive documents in the final report.

A debate over publishing private talks between Mr Bush and Mr Blair is holding up the report

The Prime Minister is said to have been furious at suggestions that the findings – already held up for several years – might not now be published until after next year’s general election.

Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry held its last public hearings in 2011, but publication of its conclusions has been held back by wrangling over  private communications between Tony Blair and George Bush.

Sir Jeremy is said to have backed concerns from intelligence services and diplomats that publishing the documents might jeopardise the ‘special relationship’ between the UK and the US.

Labour strategists are said to be concerned at the prospect of the spectre of Iraq being raised in the months before the election, since the  conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters into the arms of the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010.

Cameron said the public wanted answers on the 2003 conflict and 'shouldn't have to wait much longer'

Mr Cameron yesterday told Sky News the report should be made public by the end of 2014. He added: ‘It’s frustrating but it is not in my gift; this is an independent inquiry.

‘I want to see it published soon, my understanding is that they will be able to publish before the end of the year and I very much hope they can deliver on that timetable.

‘The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.’
