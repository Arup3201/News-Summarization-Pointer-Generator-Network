The face may look familiar to viewers of the Channel 4 television show, King of the Hill.

But salesman behind counters in Nottinghamshire failed to notice the cartoon character on the fake identity card was Bobby King. And the age given on the document was only 17.

However in an undercover operation by trading standards, a teenager using this ID card successfully purchased alcohol six times.

More than half of the 22 shops tested by the county council trading standards operation either served the teenager alcohol without asking for identification, or accepted fake ID, even though it identified that he was underage.

A total of seven stores failed to ask for identification and six checked his false ID card but still sold him the alcohol.

The council said it would issue advice to all the retailers who wrongly served the volunteer and encourage them to adopt a Challenge 25 policy when selling age-related products.

The retailing strategy encourages anyone who is older than 18 but appears younger than 25 to carry acceptable ID, such as a card bearing the PASS hologram, a photographic driving license or a passport.

Mick Murphy, the chairman of the council's community safety committee, said: 'We take the sale of age-restricted products to children very seriously.

'Although the volunteer was 18, we would strongly recommend that retailers always ask purchasers of goods such as alcohol and cigarettes for identification if they look under 25.

Retailers are being encouraged to adopt the Challenge 25 policy when selling age-related products, requiring anyone who appears under 25 to carry ID

'It is disappointing that around a quarter of the shops tested did not properly check the identification that they asked for before accepting it.

We are warning shops that we are considering using a child with fake ID following the results of this exercise.'
