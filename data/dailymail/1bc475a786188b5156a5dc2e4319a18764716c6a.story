Killing: The British soldier was shot dead by a suspected Afghan army member at the small Patrol Base Hazrat (pictured) in Helmand yesterday

A British soldier has been killed and six others wounded by a member of the Afghan National Army.

The attacker opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic rifle after a row broke out at the fortified Patrol Base Hazrat in Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand Province.

The killer, named locally as Mohammad Qasim Faroq, was said to have often led prayers. He attacked his Afghan colleagues before turning the weapon on British forces, and was shot dead at the scene.

The incident, which took place on Monday, is the latest in a series of so-called ‘green on blue’ attacks, where allies have been killed by the local forces they are training.

A total of 24 British troops have been murdered in 11 attacks by their Afghan allies since 2009.

Only two of the 12 attackers have been captured; five have been shot dead, four have escaped and the fate of the other is unknown.

The problem could affect the handover 
from international forces to local troops – a key plank of Nato’s exit 
strategy – which is due to be completed by the end of 2014.

The latest victim – a member of 28 
Engineer Regiment attached to 21 Engineer Regiment – was part of a team 
preparing for the handover. His next of kin have been informed.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed six other troops were injured in the attack.

They are not thought to have 
life-threatening injuries and were being treated in hospital at Camp 
Bastion, Britain’s main base in Helmand.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for
 the latest shooting, but army officials said the incident began with a 
fracas between the gunman and other Afghan soldiers, which boiled over 
and resulted in shots being fired indiscriminately at nearby troops.

An Afghan Defence Ministry official 
said: ‘Initial assessment and information shows the attacker was not 
linked to the Taliban.

After he killed the British soldier, he tried to 
escape but members of the Afghan national security forces opened fire, 
killing him.’

Downing Street insisted measures had 
been taken to step up protection of troops, including stronger vetting 
of recruits to Afghan security forces and better monitoring of those who
 may pose a risk.

‘These are clearly very, very serious 
incidents,’ the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. ‘The military 
always keep force protection measures under review.’

David Cameron announced last month 
that he will withdraw 3,800 British troops by December, with the 
remaining 5,200 coming home by the end of 2014.
