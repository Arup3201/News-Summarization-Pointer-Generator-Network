Disgraced Toronto mayor Rob Ford went clubbing on Saturday ... all in the name of work.

Having put his name on the ballot to run for another term, despite repeated calls for him to step down in the aftermath of his crack cocaine scandal, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process.

While the conservative politician announced he no longer drinks in the wake of admitting he smoked the illicit drug in 'a drunken stupor', Muzik is known party palace for both locals and visitors, in the past entertaining touring musicians like Justin Bieber as well as celebrities and sport stars.

Numerous photos of the 44-year-old looking hot and sweaty popped up on Instagram and Twitter, posted by revelers surprised to see Ford wandering around the dance floor.

Representatives for the Toronto man, who announced he had quit drinking in November in the wake of a drug scandal, said he had one sugar-free energy drink while at club Muzik

Councillor Doug Ford, the mayors brother and campaign manager, said the appearance was in the name of drumming  up support for the forthcoming election, set for October 27.

He said the mayor consumed only a sugar-free energy drink and was at the club for about an hour.

'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford told The Toronto Sun.

'There have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, there’s been the Bieber there and no one got a response like Rob did.

'The place went upside down ballistic.

'All he did was take pictures.'

Earlier this month Ford was the first to register for the City's municipal election, promising 'Ford more years' and claiming to be 'the best mayor this city has ever had'.

It was a surprise move following his drug fiasco and the erratic behavior that followed it, which caused international media attention and embarrassed many Canadians.

Ford was forced to admit his drug use in October after Toronto police confirmed they had obtained long-rumored video footage of him smoking from a crack pipe.

Reports of the video had surfaced in May but Ford denied its existence.

Then court documents revealed police wiretaps of alleged gang members who spoke about delivering drugs to the mayor and having pictures of him using drugs.

The wiretaps are evidence in the case against Ford's friend Alexander Lisi, who faces trial on drug and extortion charges. The mayor has not been charged.

In the weeks since the revelation, Ford was made countless efforts to show he has quit drinking and has been adhering to a healthier lifestyle, the most recent of which was his sober stop at Muzik.

'The campaign started, it’s not going to stop,' Councillor Ford said.

'I’m going to meet him for breakfast — he needs eggs because he’s on a strict diet — and we’ll go to a restaurant and the place will go upside down when we walk through.'

Prior to going to the nightclub, the mayor attended the Theatre Centre’s gala arts event.

Ford appears to need all the help he can get.

Political pundits are skeptical at his chances of being re-elected.

'I do not believe Ford will win more than about 25 percent of the vote whoever his opponents are,' University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman said earlier this month.

'It is possible, however, to win with under 30 percent, depending on the vote split.'
