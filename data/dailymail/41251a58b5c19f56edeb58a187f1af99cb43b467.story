This dramatic picture shows the moment Danny Cipriani was attended to by paramedics after being hit by a double-decker bus while on a pub crawl in Leeds with his Sale Sharks team-mates.

Cipriani tweeted after leaving hospital: 'Out of hospital now. Once again, thank you for the messages.

'Thank you for all the well wishes, means a lot. My ribs are a bit sore. Feel like I've been hit by a bus...'

The 25-year-old was treated for concussion at the scene before being rushed to hospital for more checks overnight. The impact smashed the front windscreen of the bus and left Cipriani concussed on the floor.

Cipriani was struck by the bus after running into the road while on the famous student pub crawl, the Otley Run, but was released from hospital at lunchtime on Thursday.

Cipriani will miss just the one remaining fixture for Sale this season. But it's a big one. 

The Sharks were scheduled to face his former club Wasps at the Salford City Stadium on May 4.

Cipriani landed in hot water in 2011 for taking a bottle of vodka from the bar of a local nightspot without paying for it and was later stood down for a month for breaching team curfews and failing to turn up to training.

Cipriani and actress girlfriend Kelly Brook, 33, and recently rekindled their relationship after she split from former rugby star Thom Evans.

While he was on his pub crawl, the model and actress was filming the latest episode of TV show 'Celebrity Juice' at the Riverside studios in Hammersmith. She returned home after the filming.

The Otley Run is a pub crawl which wings its way from the student-populated areas of Headingley in Leeds, back into the city centre campuses.

There is no defined route, but a number of pubs make up the traditional locations for the booze-filled student party.

It's a drunken all-dayer which typically sees those involved in fancy dress partying at up to 16 pubs heading into the city - and usually finishing up at one of the campus bars. 

A selection of pubs which feature regularly on the Otley Run:
