Brazil has failed to deal with a heavily polluted bay it promised to clean up for the 2016 Olympic sailing events, new pictures reveal.

Guanabara Bay, one of the iconic sights of Rio de Janeiro, is still blighted by sewage two years before the games.

Industrial and human pollution remain a major problem despite Rio's Olympic bid including 
the pledge to clean up the filthy bay.

According
 to the Deputy State Secretary of Environment, just 34 per cent of Rio's 
sewage is treated while the remainder flows untreated into the waters.

Yesterday,
 IOC President Thomas Bach met with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff 
and said he feels 'very confident' in the preparations for the 2016 
Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

But
 Bach acknowledged once again that Brazil has no time to lose and must 
speed up work for the first Olympics in South America.

Rio's
 preparations have been plagued by delays, the late approval of an 
operating budget and concerns about water pollution in Olympic venues 
for sailing, canoeing, rowing, and distance swimming.

IOC members have talked openly about their worries and have constantly urged Rio organizers to move faster.

'We are very confident,' Bach said 
after talks with Rousseff in Brasilia. 'We've seen great progress in the
 last couple of months.

'The organising committee has worked extremely 
well. But on the other hand, the president (Rousseff) also made it clear
 that time is key and we don't have any day to lose.'

Bach is making his first visit to Brazil since being elected president of the International Olympic Committee in September.

'I came here in full confidence that these Olympic Games will be exciting and brilliant Olympic Games,' Bach said.

Although Rio's Olympic bid included the promise to clean up the filthy bay, industrial and human pollution still remain a major problem

'After
 this meeting I can inform you that my confidence is even stronger now 
because I'm really greatly impressed by the strong commitment of the 
president to these games and by the leadership she's showing.'

The German was upbeat after meeting with Rousseff and said the Olympics would make Rio an even better city.

'I'm sure that after these Olympic Games the people of Rio and the people of Brazil will say - like for instance the people of Barcelona or the people of Munich - there is a Rio de Janeiro before the Olympic Games, and there is an even better city - if in Rio de Janeiro's case that is possible - there is an even better city after the Olympic Games.'

After a long delay, Rio organizers are expected in the next few days to announce an operating budget. The original bid document listed the operating budget at $2.8 billion. Bid cities usually underestimate the costs, and observers expect the Rio operating budget to grow.

The operating budget is to run the games themselves. About $11 billion more in public and private money will be spent on games-related projects, costs reflected in a separate capital budget.

'I can assure you this will be a very reasonable operational budget,' Bach said. 'The organizing committee is working very hard to respect the budget limitations and to make it really reasonable.'

Disagreements over the budget have gone on for months, with national, state and local governments debating who pays what. This is also an election year with Rousseff facing voters in October.

Public spending on the World Cup and Olympics has become sensitive since protests last year during the Confederations Cup.

Many Brazilians ask why billions are spent on two mega sports events when the country lacks good schools and hospitals.

Rio's chief operating officer, Leo Gryner, said in August that $700 million in public money would be needed to balance the operating budget.

Since then, chief executive officer Sidney Levy, who took over a year ago, said the $700 million would not be needed with some new income expected from local sponsorships.
