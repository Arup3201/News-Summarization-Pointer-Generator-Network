Gary Neville has hit out at Arsene Wenger for failing to give Arsenal star Mesut Ozil a rest during the Premier League Christmas period whilst revealing Cristiano Ronaldo would often be given a festive rest by Sir Alex Ferguson during his time at United.

Ozil is set for at least a 'few weeks' on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury during the Gunners' Champions League exit at the hands of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.

The Germany midfielder had looked refreshed after playing a key role in Arsenal's 4-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton on Saturday, but has often been accused of a lack of effort in big matches since the turn of the year.

Neville took to Twitter to shares his view on Wenger's decision to keep playing Ozil throughout a difficult Christmas spell.

He tweeted: 'Ozil getting a hard time. He's obviously dipped this last couple of months and first season in a new league (Xmas football) can take some getting used to even with the price tag.Some players can carry lack of form better than others.

'His body language suggests he struggles and at the moment looks like he's finding it difficult mentally. However arsenal are better for having him and he will return strong!

'And finally he will improve more when he has a Striker that runs beyond and provides movement for his strengths.

'Some rightly pointing out others who have been up and down in the first season but then improved second and third.

'Every good num 10 needs 2 to 3 players that make runs behind and sacrifice themselves! Modern game problem - Too many want to be a num 10!

'On Xmas break - no excuse really for an experienced manager. He could have given him one first two weeks in Jan- Ronaldo used to get one!' 

The 25-year-old's half-time substitution
 against Bayern seemed like a tactical move from Arsenal boss Wenger but the Frenchman has since revealed Ozil had picked up a knock.

Mistake: Gary Neville believes Arsene Wenger should have rested Ozil earlier in the season

Opener: Ozil scored the first of Arsenal's four goals against Everton in the FA Cup on Saturday

Wenger said: 'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he's out for at least a few weeks. I hope it's not too bad.'

Ozil's new injury means the £42.5million summer signing will be out for Arsenal's north London grudge match against Tottenham on Sunday as the Gunners' title charge begins to hit a wall.

The Gunners faced the difficult task of having to overcome a 2-0 deficit from the first leg of their last-16 clash in London last month and bowed out of the Champions League despite a spirited 1-1 draw against the Champions League holders at the Allianz Arena.

Wenger felt his side could have pulled off another shock result as they did last season, when winning 2-0 here, but bowing out on away goals.

'Our defending, our spirit was good. The frustration we had was the last 20 minutes I felt that Bayern was very vulnerable defensively and that we didn't take advantage of that,' he said.

'We always missed the first pass, but I felt the situations were there where we could have made more of it.

'At the end of the day we never got them really under pressure.'

Thanks, boss: Ronaldo's festives breaks could have been key to his Manchester United success
