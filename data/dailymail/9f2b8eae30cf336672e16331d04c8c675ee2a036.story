France's transport chief says faulty maintenance on a signal and hot weather may have played a role in the collision of two trains in southwest France yesterday, which left 25 injured.

The horrific crash between a high-speed 
TGV and a TER regional commuter train took place close to the town of 
Denguin, 12 miles from Pau, on the northern edge of the Pyrenees. A seven-month-old baby and a ten-year-old child are among the victims.

Frederic Cuvillier said on Europe-1 
radio Friday that 'maintenance on the signals appears to have been 
disrupted and faulty.' He noted that heat can also cause signal 
problems.

Cuvillier would not say whether the accident was due to human error or technical problems.

France,
 whose extensive train network is widely used by tourists in summer, is 
upgrading railways nationwide as part of larger reforms of the industry.

The TGV was carrying 178 passengers from Paris to Tarbes, a line extremely popular with British tourists and expats.

The
 TER had 70 on board, and looked to have suffered the worst of the 
damage. Many passengers were so badly hurt they had to be airlifted to 
hospital.

One
 witness said: ‘The TGV slowed down and then it picked up speed. It was 
hit from behind by a TER on the same line.’ The line was shut and by 8pm
 dozens of fire fighters and emergency workers were at the scene.

The accident comes a year after the Bretigny-sur-Orge rail crash near Paris, in which seven people died.

The line is extremely popular with British holidaymakers and expats who have homes in the Pyrenees area.

One 
passenger on board told local French media: ‘The TGV slowed down and 
then it picked up speed. It was hit from behind by a TER which was on 
the same line.’

The injured were believed to be aboard the commuter train, and included a 10-month-old baby who was airlifted to hospital.

The line was completely shut down and, by 8pm, dozens of firefighters and other emergency workers were at the scene.

It comes a year after the Bretigny rail crash, near Paris, in which seven people died and dozens more were injured.

The
 2013 crash highlighted the decaying state of France's rail network, 
with an official report blaming underinvestment and poor maintenance for
 the disaster.

In
 a report handed over to judges, inspectors said the Bretigny derailment
 was caused by a faulty fishplate - a bar that links two pieces of rail 
together.

Inspections in the area of the crash near the station of Bretigny-sur-Orge, south of Paris, also identified 100 defects.

These included joints that were loose or missing. Faults had been known for up to about eight months prior to the accident but nothing was done about them.

Prosecutor Eric Lallement said the main cause of the accident was a ‘shortfall in the quality of maintenance’.

Hundreds of thousands of British people use the French railway network every year, with the high speed Eurostar link between Paris and London making connections extremely straightforward.
