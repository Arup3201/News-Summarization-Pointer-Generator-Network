Researchers now say the daring 1962 Alcatraz jail break that many have said over the decades likely ended in the deaths of the escapees may have had a happy ending for the three daring escapees.

New computer models that consider  the San Francisco Bay's tides, winds and other factors reveal the prisoners stood a small chance of paddling to freedom on the north side of the Golden Gate Bridge.

According to the Dutch team of scientists that assembled the data, it all depends on the time inmates Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris set sail in their makeshift dingy made of raincoats.

The way they look today? New computer models that consider the San Francisco Bay's tides, winds and other factors reveal John and Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris stood a small chance of paddling to freedom from Alcatraz. Here, prison mug shots of the trio are compared to images of how they might look today

Best case scenario: Computer models assembled by a Dutch team of researchers reveal the escapees had a chance to beat the odds if they launched their dingy of raincoats between 11pm and midnight and then paddled hard to the north

'Only in the time window between (11pm) and midnight do they get close enough to the shore to have a chance to survive,' writes one of the researchers, Dr. Rolf Hut, on his blog.

Otherwise, one of three disastrous things would have happened.

Had they launched in the hours before, the men would have been sucked out into the frigid Pacific and died of hypothermia.

Had they waited until after midnight, the tide would have shifted during their daring voyage and the current would have pushed them deeper into the San Francisco Bay.

There, they either would have perished from cold before they got close enough to the East Bay to make landfall or gotten picked up by authorities when the sun rose in the morning.

The Rock: For 20th century crime buffs, few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the "Escape from Alcatraz," the 1962 prison break three inmates pulled off with stolen spoons, dummy heads and a raincoat raft.

Worst case: If the escapees left too early or failed to paddle north after leaving the island, they would have gotten sucked into the Pacific and died

We know the third possibility never happened. Out of the 36 Alcatraz inmates who tried to flee before the prison was closed in March 1963, the three are the only ones who remain unaccounted for, according to the U.S. Marshals Service, which maintains active arrest warrants on Morris and the Anglins.

Assuming the men did launch sometime around 11:30 and somehow knew to first paddle their makeshift boat hard to the north--towards Angel Island, where some of their belongings and a paddle would later be found--they could have become the only prisoners to ever escape the so-called inescapable prison.

'If they hit it exactly at midnight, the beautiful thing is that we see that they would have been sucked out towards the Golden Gate Bridge,' Dr Hut told BBC News.

Shocking simplicity: The men used spoons to dig holes through their cell walls

As they neared the bridge, the shifting tides would have made paddling far easier. 

'In the best case, the escapees peddle northwards with a speed of almost 1 km per hour, an almost olympian effort. In that scenario, they most likely survive and make it to the north side of the Golden Gate bridge,' Hut wrote.

Whether or not that happened, we're unlikely to ever know and the story's sensational mystery remains.

For 20th century crime buffs, few capers match the intrigue and ingenuity of the 'Escape from Alcatraz,' which the inmates pulled off with stolen spoons, dummy heads and a raincoat raft.  

The escapees fashioned these dummy heads using soap, paper and real hair that they placed on their beds to fool guards

The FBI acquired most of what it learned about the great escape from a fourth inmate who planned to take part in the break out but, at the last minute, ran into technical problems.  

The four reportedly spent months using spoons and forks to dig holes in the crumbling masonry surrounding the air vents in their cells. 

The crawl spaces they fashioned eventually pierced the six-and-a-half-inch thick walls until they reached a utility corner, from which they were able to shimmy out through a roof vent.

To prepare for their flights, they also produced a raft and life vests out of more than 50 cotton raincoats, with rubberized backing, that inmates were assigned.

They also had created mannequin heads out of paper, paint and hair purloined from the prison barber shop. They left the heads in their beds while they worked on the raft and the night of the getaway.

Replicas of the dummy heads lie in their former cells, which are popular stops with the more than a million tourists who visit Alcatraz Island every year.

While what happened to the three men remains a mystery, the escape's enduring mystique isn't ambiguous at all, National Park Service spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said.

'It's one of those yarns where everyone can attach their own reality because they can wrap themselves around whatever part they want,' Picavet said.

The holes led to an unused utility area. From there, they shimmied onto the roof through a vent in the ceiling
