Prison guards have taken to wearing lapel-mounted cameras to capture violent outbursts from prisoners in New Zealand's toughest jails.

The disturbing video footage shows prisoners threatening guards and staff responding to fights in maximum and high-security areas of Rimutaka and Auckland prisons.

The smartphone-sized on-body cameras are part of a new six-month trial to increase guard and prisoner safety and help in gathering evidence.

The smartphone-sized on-body cameras being used in Rimutaka and Auckland prisons captured the moment a man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up the phone after lock up

Footage collected from inside the prisons was shown for the first time on Wednesday to New Zealand politicians, stuff.co.nz reports.

Two prisoners were filmed yelling abuse at guards after they were told to stop using prison phones.

One was told to hang up because he became abusive to his partner on the other end.

The other man, who is known for assaulting staff, refused to hang up after lock up.

'You're f****** lucky you're wearing that camera,' he yelled to guard as he returned to his cell.

The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed

Soon after, prison guards recorded footage of scratches on the ground showing the weapon had been sharpened in another cell

In another incident, guards were captured running to break up a prisoner fight in a maximum security unit.

They restrained one prisoner as he lashed out yelling 'Give me arm and I'll f*** you up'.

The cameras are also being used to collect evidence and in one case the guards found a sharp weapon in the drain of a shower after an inmate was stabbed.

Footage of scratches on the ground showed evidence of the weapon being sharpened in another cell.

This inmate was told to hang up the prison phone because he became abusive to his partner on the other end

Prison guards said the camera had a clear impact on the inmate's behaviour. Ending phone calls can often end in violent outbursts and assaults, according to staff

Corrections Minister Anne Tolley said in most cases the camera acted as a deterrent for escalated, violent behaviour.

'I'm not sure anyone's ever made public film taken from inside a prison, but we thought it was interesting enough to show how technology can be used to protect our staff and also improve behaviour,' she said.

'If we can improve behaviour and management of prisoners… it keeps staff safe and keeps (prisoners) safe.

'I've been in and out of prisons and talked with prisoners, but not normally in those sorts of circumstances.'
