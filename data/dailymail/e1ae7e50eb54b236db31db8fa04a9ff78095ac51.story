A naked swimmer was dramatically rescued by 20 firemen yesterday after getting stranded in a muddy river while taking a dip.

The man, who is believed to be in his early thirties, had been swimming in the River Usk in Newport, South Wales, for two hours yesterday afternoon.

He was seen in distress by a member of the public near the George Street Bridge over the river at 3:40pm and the firemen were sent to save him.

It is thought the man was in the river to cool off, although temperatures were warm rather than sweltering yesterday - reaching 19c (66f) locally.

Fire crews and police signalled to the swimmer to make his way towards shore, but he could not climb up the slippery mud banks.

He was thrown a towel to protect his modesty and eventually managed to haul himself up to safety after rescue lines were cast down.

Eyewitnesses said the man did not seem to be injured, although he was checked over by paramedics after leaving the water.

Retired computer engineer Harry Wilkins, 63, saw the incident unfold and caught it on camera.

'It was a hot day and he just peeled off and waded in, but it's the last place in the world you'd want to go for a swim'Harry Wilkins, witness

He said: ‘It was a hot day and he just
peeled off and waded in, but it's the last place in the world you'd 
want to go for a swim.

‘I hope his tetanus and vaccinations are up to date. He was fine and didn't know what all the fuss was about.’

A Gwent Police spokesman said no offence was committed and the man was free to go after paramedics had checked him.

Another witness said: ‘I was just passing and saw a lot of commotion, police cars, sirens, fire-engines and ambulances all looking out across the river at a guy splashing around.

‘He was swimming completely naked so he must have had a good day.’

It was the second rescue from the River Usk in two days after a woman was saved on Monday just before she was swept out to sea.

Temperatures in the Cardiff area reached 19c yesterday, while low tide on the river was at 4pm.

Britain is today enjoying a dry and fine day with plenty of sunshine, and only a slight build-up of cloud over northern areas into the afternoon.

Wednesday

Thursday

Friday

Tonight there is a dry night forecast with generally clear skies, although it will turn increasingly cloudy and windy in northern Scotland later.

On Thursday, any early mist and fog across southern and central areas will soon lift to give a dry and sunny day for much of England and Wales.

Scotland and Northern Ireland will become overcast from the north-west with strengthening winds, before rain outbreaks spread south-eastwards.

It will be fairly cloudy for many on Friday with a few spots of rain, but southern areas of England should remain dry and sunny.
