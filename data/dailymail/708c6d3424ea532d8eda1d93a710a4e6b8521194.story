Matin Kimber, former Rotherham council chief, has been handed £26,666 after agreeing to quit his job two months before his notice period ends 

There was outrage tonight over the payment of £26,000 to the council chief executive at the centre of the Rotherham abuse scandal to leave his job early.

Martin Kimber issue a ‘sincere apology to those who were let down’ when he resigned from Rotherham Council and promised he would not receive any ‘compensation’ for his decision to quit his £160,000 a year post.

Mr Kimber was originally intending to work his three months notice until the end of the year, but left his post on 31 October instead, to allow the new chief executive to get on with the job.

As a result the local authority paid him £26,666 - the salary he would have received had he worked the final two months.

But the move has angered abuse victims.

One 29-year-old Rotherham abuse victim said: ‘I used to think that nothing else can shock me but I’ve given up saying that because each day something comes out that shocks me even further.

‘It is disgusting that this man gets a payout of more than most people’s annual salary. It is appalling that these people are getting big lump sums when they should have been sacked on the spot.

‘It’s like rewarding good behaviour. If they were really sorry they would donate the money to charity.’ 

John O’Connell, Director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will question why they are handing over hard-earned money for an official to spend two months relaxing at home.

'If the Council feels he is surplus to requirements, taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay his salary. 

'This £26,000 could pay for a social worker, and it’s quite clear Rotherham needs to be doing more to look after vulnerable residents not keep former Chief Executives in the style to which they’re accustomed.’

When giving evidence to MPs in September, Mr Kimber was asked if he would be taking compensation after handing in his notice. He said: ‘There is no compensation. I have had no such discussion and neither would I, just for the record.’

Between 1997 and 2013 more than 1,400 girls were sexually abused by gangs of men, largely from the Asian and Pakistani community, while authorities refused to investigate (file image)

The chief executive was one of a number of senior local authority executives to quit after a report published in August revealed 1,400 children had been abused in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013.

Rotherham Council insisted Mr Kimber had ‘received no pay-off’ but was paid in lieu of notice.

Mr Kimber had been asked by new council leader Paul Lakin to carry out a ‘thorough internal investigation’ into the alleged theft of files from a locked council office in 2002, as well as the disappearance of four years of meeting minutes about child abuse issues. 

A former  Rotherham mayor has been charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl in the 1980s.

Councillor Barry Dodson (right) was charged with indecent assault by police today.

It is alleged Dodson, 67, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, committed the offence in 1987.

He has been released on bail and will appear at Sheffield Magistrates Court on December 18.

Councillor Dodson stood down as mayor in June, three weeks after taking office.

He resigned from the Labour party and now stands as an independent.

This work had not been completed by the time he left.

A Rotherham Council spokesman said: ‘It was agreed in September between the authority and Mr Kimber that he would leave at the end of December - serving the usual three month notice period. 

'However, he decided to leave his position two months early, with effect from October 31, to enable the new chief executive to start. 

'The authority continues to look into the matters raised in the Jay Report.’

Even the UKIP opposition leader councillor Cavan Vines backed the decision. 

He said: ‘For the council to move on we felt it appropriate for him to leave early so there would be a clean road ahead. It is a way of moving the council forward.’

The report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed how hundreds of vulnerable girls had been sexually exploited by gangs of predominantly Asian men in the town and that police and council officials had betrayed the victims by not tackling the problem. 

Senior council officials feared being labelled ‘racist’ for speaking about the pattern of offenders being of Pakistani origin.

Mr Kimber, who had been chief executive since 2009, initially stayed in his job when the scandal broke. When he quit in September he said the report did ‘not make comfortable reading in its account of the horrific experiences of some young people in the past.’

He said it was ‘right to leave’ his job and hoped new leadership would ‘enable the town to recover more quickly.’
