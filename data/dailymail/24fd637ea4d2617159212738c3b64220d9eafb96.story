It pushed the boundaries of typical teen TV earlier this year, revolving around two high school best friends that pretend to be lesbians in order to become popular.

Now MTV's quirky rom com series Faking It is continuing to break ground by introducing an intersex character in its second season.

Premiering Tuesday night to 1.04 million viewers, the show revealed that regular character Lauren - stepsister of protagonist Amy - has both male and female chromosomes.

Played by actress Bailey De Young, Lauren was born genetically male, but her body naturally developed as female, according to CNN.

About one in every 2,000 people are born with intersex traits.

Generally their reproductive anatomy does not fit the definition of male or female, such as a female born with an enlarged clitorus or without a vaginal opening, according to the Intersex Societ of North America.

Some males are born with a small penis and a scrotum that has formed more like a labia.

'Part of the overall theme of 'Faking It' is how hard it is to be your authentic self and how important it is to strive to do that,' show developer Carter Covington told The Hollywood Reporter.

'For Lauren, being born intersex is going to be something she's going to struggle to accept and then struggle to defend in her life.'

Covington said he had prepared for a fight with MTV over the plot.

However the network embraced the idea.

'People want to create TV that touches people and that shows a different subset,' he said.

'I'm always excited as a writer when there is an experience I can relate to, and MTV wanted programming that touches people and moves people.'

In the episode, the character of Lauren can be seen turning to an online support group after her friends are made aware that she was born intersex.

Convington said the consultant the show worked with to better understand people born intersex was a member of Inter/Act, the first intersex youth advocacy organization.

'We're trying to give people tools to build and connect with that community,' he told The Hollywood Reporter.

'People born with these conditions are often told they will never meet anyone else like them, and they all found that not to be true. '

Faking It is set in Austin, Texas.

It's theme center around empowering outcasts and breaking convention.

The most popular person at the high school, Shane, is gay.
