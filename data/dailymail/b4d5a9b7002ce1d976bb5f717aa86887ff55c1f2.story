A young mother has lost more than half her body weight after discovering that she was too fat to fit into an aeroplane seat belt.

Katy Isaac's embarrassing moment came in 2006, when the 28-year-old tipped the scales at an unhealthy 22 stone.

After boarding a flight to Turkey, the mother-of-two found herself unable to do up the safety strap and was forced to ask the stewardess for an extender belt usually given to pregnant women.

Horrified, Katy, who works as a dinner lady in her home town of Welshpool in Shropshire, decided something had to be done about her weight, most of which had crept on thanks to a diet of chips and Chinese takeaways.

After failing to lose weight on her own, she finally joined Slimming World 18 months ago and cut out junk food and cooking with oil.

Since then, Katy, who is married to Craig, 41, has lost an incredible 12 stone 5lbs and now weighs a trim nine stone 13lbs and is a svelte size eight.

'I’d tried losing weight before but I always failed miserably because the diets I followed would leave me feeling hungry and deprived, and so I’d be miserable, too,' explains Katy.

'I was never a big person until the birth of my daughter Milly when I started living on convenience foods.

All gone: Katy says the experience was so humiliating, she returned determined to lose weight

'We would eat ready meals every day, and loads of takeaways, I loved a trip to the chippy or a Chinese meal.

'The lowest point was for my honeymoon to Turkey, I got on the plane and sat in my seat, but when I picked up the belt I realised it would not fit around my stomach.

'I tried and tried but it would not go, I realised there were people staring at me, it was so embarrassing for me.

'I had to call the stewardess, and they had to bring me an extender normally given to pregnant woman or parents who have children on their laps. I tried after that to lose the weight, but it still didn’t work.

'I’d miss my favourite foods too much, so before long I’d have thrown in the towel and be back where I started. But Slimming World was completely different to anything I’d known before.' 

Katy, who earlier this month was named one of
Slimming World’s slimmer of the years and met a host of stars, 
including West Life star Brian McFadden, at the awards ceremony in 
Birmingham, says small changes made the biggest difference.

Family: Katy says her children Milly and Harvey. pictured in 2007, are benefiting from her new regime

Award: Katy was named one of Slimming World's slimmers of the year for 2013 following her diet

'The changes I made to the way I cooked and ate were small ones, like swapping white bread for wholemeal and using low calorie spray instead of oil or butter, but they made a big difference,' she explains.

'They meant I could still enjoy all my favourites and lose weight. It was great to be able to eat the same as my family and friends instead of having to have a separate diet dinner, too, so they’ve benefited from eating more healthily without even trying.'

Katy has also swapped ready meals for homemade suppers and says that she's not the only one feeling the benefits of her newly healthy lifestyle.

'I feel so much better now, and I feel better for my children. Everything we eat at home is now home-made, it means I have not only helped myself but improved my children’s lives.

'It is fantastic, my next goal is to run a half marathon, I love running now, it’s one of the things there was no way I could do 18-months-ago.''

Heather Robertson, who runs the Welshpool Slimming World group, said: 'Katy doesn’t only look great on the outside; she’s a new woman on the inside, too. 

'Nowadays she’s unrecognisable from the shy, unhappy woman who walked into the group all those months ago.

'She’s happier, healthier and more confident, and her success is contagious as she’s inspired so many other people in the group.'
