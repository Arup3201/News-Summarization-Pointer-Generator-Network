A man was rescued by a father and his daughter after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and managing to survive the 220-foot plunge.

Scott Walecka, 56, of Santa Cruz, was sailing his 38-foot vessel Animal to San Francisco to prepare for Friday's Spinnaker Cup race from the city to Monterey when his daughter, 23-year-old Hilary, said she saw a person jump from the bridge shortly before 2 p.m. on Monday.

The duo heard a Coast Guard radio call for a jumper in the water moments later and sailed toward the man after spotting him underneath a California Highway Patrol helicopter.

Survived: A man jumped 220 feet off the Golden Gate Bridge lived to be picked up by a father and daughter who were sailing nearby

Eagle-eyed: Hilary Walecka spotted the man plunging into San Francisco Bay as she sailed into port with her father Scott

'He was alive and wanted to be rescued,' Walecka said.

Mr Walecka said the man grabbed a life sling they threw overboard.

His legs appeared to be broken, but he was able to grab the sling and pull himself to the back of the boat.

He described the man, who authorities said was 31 and homeless, as 'buff' and 'fit.'

The man said he was from Alabama, but appeared incapable of saying much else, Walecka said.

They sailed to a Coast Guard station in Sausalito accompanied by a Coast Guard vessel.

Man overboard: This sailboat, called Animal, is the the very boat on which the unidentified man was pulled onboard

 More than 1,600 people have jumped from the Golden gate bridge since it opened in 1937.

At least 33 people died by suicide by jumping off the span in 2012.

In 2011, 37 people jumped to their 
deaths off the bridge.

At least 30 have died every year since 2008, 
according to the Bridge Rail Foundation, an organization that advocates 
for a suicide-prevention barrier on the span.

In 2008, the bridge transit district approved plans to build a $50 million suicide-prevention system. However, the system would not be funded with bridge toll revenue, and it currently faces a $45 million shortfall.

From there, the man was transferred to Marin General Hospital by fire officials. Southern Marin Fire Protection District Chief Jim Irving said yesterday he did not know the man’s condition.

More than 1,500 people have jumped to their death from the span since it opened in 1937, making it one of the world’s most active suicide spots.

It’s not clear what prompted the man to jump on Monday, but few people ever survive the plunge.

Most jumpers die a grisly death, with massive internal injuries and broken bones, while others simply drown in the frigid waters of San Francisco Bay.

The bridge’s board of directors has approved a net system to prevent suicides. The final design for the project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Safety measures: To try and discourage suicides, the bridge is closed to pedestrians at night and there are signs posted alone the bridge offering people a phone number if they need to talk to someone
