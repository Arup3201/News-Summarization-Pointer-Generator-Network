EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton gave controversial Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko a warm embrace yesterday, as she promised the country help in fighting its financial crisis.

The first senior foreign official to visit Ukraine’s capital Kiev since President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown, Baroness Ashton urged Russia to allow its neighbour to move forward ‘in the way it chooses’.

‘We are here to say we want to support and help the country to stay strong and to go forward in the way it chooses to,’ she said.

‘We also think it is very important to send a strong message about the territorial integrity, and the unity and the independence of Ukraine.’

Baroness Ashton said Ukraine needed ‘short-term help and long-term investment’, but any British involvement in a £19billion bailout has been described as ‘completely unacceptable’ by MPs.

The meeting came on another day of dramatic developments which saw Yanukovych still on the run, his former chief of staff – and one of the few believed to know where he is – shot and wounded, and elite police officers suspected of shooting at protesters forced to beg for forgiveness from their colleagues.

Amid extraordinary scenes in the city of Lviv, the officers were greeted with chants of ‘Shame!’ and ‘Tribunal!’ but claimed they had not killed or beaten people themselves.

So far, only Yanukovych has been charged with crimes against humanity after the killing by security forces of 82 protesters in Kiev, but there were claims yesterday that secret documents linked a senior Moscow intelligence figure to an operation to wipe out protest leaders.

If true, the papers could be hugely damaging to Russia, allegedly showing two secret operations to target protesters called ‘Boomerang’ and ‘Wave’.

Ukraine’s parliament yesterday called on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the deposed leader and his henchmen over the ‘mass murder’ of protesters.

Interim president Oleksandr Turchinov also warned of ‘very dangerous signs of separatism’ in several regions, and was last night locked in meetings with his security services on how to prevent the country splitting in two – with half favouring ties with the EU, half with Russia.

Significantly, an online petition calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade eastern Ukraine was dramatically deleted last night after going viral on the Russian- language web.

A map linked to the petition showed how Ukraine would look if Moscow annexed its eastern regions, creating a separate country or super-region called ‘New Russia’.

In less than 24 hours, almost 100,000 had expressed support for dividing the country.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said authorities in Ukraine had taken power as a result of ‘armed mutiny’.

Yesterday Russian military units denied reports that they had been involved in an operation to smuggle Yanukovych  to Moscow.

The search for the Putin ally was further confused when chief of staff Andriy Klyuyev, one of the last men known to have been with him, was shot twice in the leg.
