An X-rated TV prank has left the prime minister of Serbia feeling a little overexposed after he was flashed by a glamorous presenter during an interview.

The country's Socialist party leader Ivica Dačić was midway through a discussion about Balkan politics when the young woman, wearing a particularly short mini dress, uncrossed her legs to reveal she wasn't wearing any underwear.

The YouTube video, a clear copy of the famous scene starring Sharon Stone in the 1992 film Basic Instinct, has already had more than 1.2million hits.

Hot topic: The glamorous presenter listens attentively after asking the Prime Minister some questions about Balkan politics

Censored: A close-up shot reveals the presenter's wardrobe indiscretion but fortunately her lack of modesty is censored for the viewers

Amused: The Prime Minister stumbles over his words but cannot avoid a cheeky smile

In scenes that are about as far away as you can get from the sort of political debate Jeremy Paxman delivers on Newsnight, the shocked politician stumbles over his words while having a quick look.

Copycat: The stunt was a clear attempt to recreate the famous scene starring Sharon Stone in the 1991 film Basic Instinct

The stunt was a set up by a candid camera show called Nemoguca Misija - which translates as 'Mission Impossible'.

It begins with producers discussing the best way to embarrass Mr Dačić before he arrives for the interview.

As he walks into the building, the presenter is seen removing her underwear, off camera in another room.

She greets the Prime Minister with kisses on each cheek before sitting down opposite with her legs crossed.

After asking Mr Dačić some political questions, the presenter appears to be listening intently before casually uncrossing her legs.

Fortunately
 the camera covers her modesty with a 'censored' sign, but the look of 
shock on the Prime Minister's face shows he has clearly noticed the 
wardrobe indiscretion.

He stumbles across his words but appears to keep his cool remarkably well.

Revealing: The glamorous presenter is shown removing her underwear in a separate room before the Prime Minister arrives
