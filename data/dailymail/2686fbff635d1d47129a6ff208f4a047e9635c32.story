Chief Inspector of the Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said budget cuts mean a smaller police force that won't investigate less serious crimes

Police faced fury last night after the Chief Inspector of Constabulary warned forces may have to ignore crimes such as shoplifting.

Sir Tom Winsor said looming budget cuts mean they will need to focus on offences that ‘matter most to people’.

But critics accused him of promoting a cavalier approach to policing and pointed out shoplifting is not a victimless crime.

Sir Tom, head of the police watchdog, said shrinking forces will need to ‘work smarter’, focusing on crimes such as violent or drug-related offences and sexual exploitation of children.

He told BBC Radio 4: ‘Austerity is here to stay. We are heading for a smaller police service.’ 

Asked if there will be crimes that officers should not investigate ‘quite so hard’, Sir Tom replied: ‘Any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously, however there are crimes that are more serious than others.

‘Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people.’

Last night, his comments provoked anger from MPs and retail experts.

They said ignoring shoplifting would blight communities, damage the economy and have a knock-on effect on gang crime, drugs and anti-social behaviour.

John Munro of the British Retail Consortium, said: ‘Shoplifting is not a victimless crime. It affects people who work in stores – often thefts can be violent and cause a great deal of damage and cost.

‘If you leave shoplifting unchallenged, it starts a spiral of decline where communities end up blighted by other crime.’

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken

Shoplifting is on the rise, with 321,014 thefts across England and Wales in the year to June, up 21,000 on the previous 12 months. 

Tory MP Michael Ellis, a criminal barrister, said: ‘As someone who has prosecuted shoplifters as well as more serious cases of violence and sexual offences, I think there has to be an understanding of the consequences of allowing offences of dishonesty.

‘As well as damaging the economy, it would be wrong to dismiss shoplifting cases in a cavalier fashion because these costs are met by the general public.’

Last month Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned of a threat to public safety without radical police reforms in the face of budget cuts. 

Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation representing rank and file officers, called last night for a debate on which crimes the public wants officers to concentrate on. 

He said: ‘We can’t continue to police the way we have.’

Chief Constable Peter Vaughan, acting president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘We have been prepared to expect further budget reductions in the coming years. 

'An unprecedented rise in reports of child abuse, cyber-crime and public protection issues means that forces need to invest more heavily in these areas.’
