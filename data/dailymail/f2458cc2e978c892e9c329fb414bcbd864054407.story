Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of FA Cup fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League...

1. Long balls, searching balls, call them what you want but when Marouane Fellaini plays for Manchester United their defenders look for him as their first option.

Of 51 passes played into the giant Belgian during the 2-1 defeat at Swansea, some 29 of them came from either the back four or goalkeeper David de Gea.

Antonio Valencia, brought on as a second half substitute for right back Paddy McNair, found Fellaini eight times – more often in 45 minutes than anybody else did in 90.

2. Rio Ferdinand is doing his best to end his career on a high note after a desperate first half to the season at Queens Park Rangers.

Restored to the side when Chris Ramsey took over from Harry Redknapp, the 36-year-old was Rangers’ best defender at Hull, making 11 clearances as he tried to rescue the team from Joey Barton’s ridiculous red card.

The former England star wasn’t bad in possession, either – he failed to find a team mate with only four of 23 passes, and on each occasion managed to win the ball back.

3. Mark Noble was lucky not to get a second yellow card at Tottenham – but West Ham suffered for his lack of discipline anyway.

The midfield man was Hammers’ best player until Sam Allardyce took him off after 68 minutes, having set up five chances, covered most ground, and made more accurate passes (35) than any other West Ham player managed in the whole game.

But when Big Sam took off his captain to make sure he didn’t get sent off, Spurs regained a foothold to come back from 2-0 down to take a point.

4. Tim Sherwood shouldn’t beat himself up too much at losing his first match in his new job – it’s nothing new for Aston Villa managers.

Since the Premier League started only two of 12 Villa bosses have collected three points from their first League match in charge.

One was John Gregory who oversaw a 2-0 win against Liverpool in February 1998 - the other Sherwood’s new assistant Kevin MacDonald who scored a 3-0 win over West Ham at the start of a brief spell as caretaker.

5. Branislav Ivanovic has emerged as a big character in Chelsea’s dressing room in the last few weeks but the desire to be a leader seems to be affecting his discipline.

The Serbian full back appeared to have learned some lessons after getting just one booking from the 17 appearances that followed his sending off at Manchester United in October.

But in the last six games, in which he’s scored four times, he’s also been shown four yellow cards.

6. Shola Ameobi could be a valuable addition to Crystal Palace’s squad as Alan Pardew aims to make sure they don’t drop back into the relegation fight.

The 33-year-old’s return to the Premier League on a free transfer after a spell in Turkey was a deal that went under the radar in the last few days of the January window.

But the Nigerian had an impact on his debut – running more than a mile in his 10 minute cameo appearance to unsettle Arsenal’s defence and help fellow sub Glenn Murray find the room to score Palace’s late goal and almost grab an equaliser.

7. Robert Huth will add some power in both boxes for Leicester on the evidence of his debut at Everton, where as well as making 11 clearances he was a constant threat at set pieces.

The 6ft 3ins German, on a loan from Stoke until the end of the season, hadn’t started a Premier League game since he got injured in November 2013.

8. Midfielder George Thorne’s return to fitness from a cruciate knee ligament injury is perfectly timed to help Derby’s run-in to try and win promotion.

The 22-year-old made a permanent move to the iPro Stadium during the summer after outstanding performances while on loan from West Brom, only to collect his injury before the campaign began.

He showed encouraging signs of last season’s form in the 61 minutes he played during the 3-2 win over Sheffield Wednesday.

9. Bradford’s mudheap of a pitch at Valley Parade might be their ally in the FA Cup but it’s doing Phil Parkinson’s side no favours against League One opposition.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet left there moaning about the playing surface after getting knocked out, and Reading won’t be looking forward to it ahead of Saturday’s quarter-final.

Perhaps boss Steve Clarke could ring Walsall’s Dean Smith for some advice. The 1-1 draw with the Saddlers meant Bradford have won only once in the League at home since the turn of the year.

10. Mario Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge could take a lesson in team spirit from Oxford winger Alex MacDonald.

The two Liverpool superstars squabbled last week over who should take a Europa Cup penalty – meanwhile down in League Two 24-year-old MacDonald gave up the chance of a hat-trick to help a team-mate.

The new signing from Burton had scored twice before Oxford were awarded a spot kick. He was due to take it, but instead handed the ball to striker Danny Hylton to rebuild some confidence by tucking away only his second goal since December.
