European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has left individual governments to find their own economic solutions

The crisis in the recession-battered eurozone escalated yesterday as unemployment there soared to a record high of close to 20million.

The jobless rate in the single currency bloc hit 12.2 per cent, far higher than in Britain and the US, statistics agency Eurostat said.

Youth unemployment surged to a devastating 24.4 per cent – meaning one in four Europeans under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job.

The jobless rate among young Greeks reached 62.5 per cent while 56.4 per cent of young Spaniards and 40.5 per cent of young Italians are out of work.

Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at French bank Societe Generale, said the worst-hit countries are at risk of a ‘lost generation’ who will never find work.

It is feared that rocketing unemployment – particularly among the young – will fuel resentment against the euro and trigger a break-up of the single currency bloc.

The European Commission warned this week that unemployment across the region is ‘unacceptably high’ and threatens ‘grave social consequences’.

French president Francois Hollande said it could lead to the breakdown of Europe. ‘Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project,’ he said. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said European ‘unity’ was at risk.

Italian labour minister Enrico Giovannini said: ‘We have to rescue an entire generation of young people who are scared.’

Eurostat said unemployment in the 
single currency bloc soared to 19.4million in April – up by 95,000 in 
one month and 1.6million in a year.

Inflation is well below the the European Central bank's target of two percent

The number of under-25s out of work 
has soared by 188,000 to 3.6million in the past 12 months. The grim 
figures came days after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development slashed its forecasts for the eurozone economy.

It now expects it to shrink by 0.6 per cent this year, far worse than the 0.1 per cent slide previously predicted.

In Britain, where unemployment is 
below 8 per cent, output is expected to grow by 0.8 per cent this year –
making the UK the best performing major economy in Europe.
