Plastic banknotes which can survive a hot 90-degree washing machine cycle could arrive in Britain within three years, the Bank of England said yesterday.

In a break with tradition, the Bank is considering ditching the current £5 and £10 notes – which are made from cotton paper –and replacing them with ones made from polymer.

The new notes last for more than twice as long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear.

The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability.

A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday.

Plastic notes were introduced in Australia in 1988 to try and stop counterfeiting.

They are due to be issued in New Zealand, Romania, Mexico and Vietnam and current Governor of the Bank of England introduced them in his native Canada. A special one-off plastic £5 was previously issued in Northern Ireland to commemorate the Millennium.

The bank says the introduction of plastic notes will save about £10million a year as they will not have to be replaced so often. Polymer £5 notes will measure 125mm by 65mm, smaller than the current note.

Supporters of polymer notes say they are more hygienic, harder to tear and more difficult to counterfeit. But critics say they stick together and are slippery.

And
 they can also be recycled to create items including plant pots and 
garden furniture – a move which is likely to please Diana Carney, the 
wife of the new Bank governor and a committed environmentalist.

Her
 husband Mark was at the helm of the Bank of Canada when polymer notes 
were introduced in 2011, and is importing the idea to Britain just 11 
weeks after taking over the top job.

The
 Bank said yesterday it will initially look only at changing £5 and £10 
notes, with the new £5 featuring Sir Winston Churchill becoming the 
first polymer note in 2016.

But they are planning to hold focus groups and meetings in shopping centres to test public opinion about the scheme.

And if the feedback is overwhelmingly negative the Bank have promised to scrap the idea altogether.

The new notes will still feature the Queen and a well-known person, but will be slightly smaller than the current note.

The £5 note is now 135mm by 70mm. The new one will measure just 125mm by 65mm.

But they will continue to maintain ‘tiered-sizing’ – meaning that the higher the denomination, the bigger the note will be.

The
 Bank of England has tested the polymer notes in a 90-degree washing 
cycle which seemed to have only ‘a minimal effect’, unlike the current 
notes which can be ‘substantially degraded’.

They then ‘submerged them 
in liquids, including red wine,’ and found they could be wiped clean, 
unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates.

Polymer
 notes are already used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, 
New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as in Canada.

The Bank of England said polymer notes would save them £10million a year because they last longer

New Bank of England Governor Mark Carney introduced polymer notes to Canada previously

But
 the Bank of Canada was forced to deny that their notes were scented, 
after authorities were inundated with queries about why people thought 
that they could detect a ‘hint of maple’ when smelling the bills.

Questions remained last night about how cash machines or payment machines would cope with the new notes.

But
 a spokesman for Link, the company which is behind 66,000 of Britain’s 
cash machines, said: ‘The ATM industry will work closely with the Bank 
to ensure their effective introduction.’

The
 public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to 
finish on 15 November and a final decision will be announced in 
December.
