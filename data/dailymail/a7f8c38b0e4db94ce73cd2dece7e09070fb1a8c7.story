The huts at Bletchley Park where British mathematicians cracked the Nazi Enigma code are to be rebuilt.

The trust has raised the £2.4 million required to restore the huts where codebreakers led by Alan Turing shortened the war by up to two years.

'Raising these funds has been a race against time to save the Huts from dereliction,' said Iain Standen, CEO of the Bletchley Park Trust.

The huts at Bletchley Park were where 
British mathematicians worked in secret to crack Germany's Enigma code, 
using desks, blackboards, and feeding their results through primitive 
mechanical computers that are the grandfathers of the machines we use 
today.

Working in utmost secrecy, codebreakers at Bletchley Park cracked Germany's 'unbreakable' Enigma code - and being able to 'listen in' on Nazi communications helped to shorted World War II

Manchester don Turing devised an 'electromechanical' machine that could break the code used by the German Navy.

He
is widely seen as the father of modern computing - but was persecuted 
for his homosexuality, and committed suicide in 1954 by eating a 
cyanide-laced apple.

'The 
huts were very basic, filled with desks, blackboards - and felt 
university-like,' says Sinclair McKay, author of The Secret Life of 
Bletchley Park.

'The huts were where all the amazing flashing moments of
insight happened, though - often with no machinery whatsoever.'

Huts at Bletchley Park were where many of the moments of inspiration occurred that led to Britain cracking the German Enigma code - but today one of the main huts stands derelict and two are in need of restoration

Those huts were terribly cold in 
winter - most people wore mittens. They had sqeaky lino, and dozens of 
people worked side by side on desks.

Messages were passed between huts 
down a tunnel on a tray pushed along with a broom handle.

'It
was run by MI6 - but actually the people working inside those huts were
civilians,' says McKay.

'Many were mathematicians drawn from 
universities. They would get their summons, but instead of reporting for
the front line, they would report for duty at Bletchley Park.

'Bletchley
Park was the dawn of computer age,' says McKay, 'For young people 
especially, it's an amazing insight into how the Nazis were outwitted 
and how computing began- in rooms filled with desks, and paper and blackboards, without a machine in sight. That's why this restoration is crucial.'
