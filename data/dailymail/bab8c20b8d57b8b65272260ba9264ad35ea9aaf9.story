The key witness in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse trial has testified that three top Penn State University officials conspired together to keep the former football couch's child molesting a secret - and that even Joe Paterno lamented the coverup.

Mike McQueary, himself a former assistant Nittany Lions coach, said Monday that the legendary head coach spoke several times about the failure of university officials to report Sandusky to police - warning that if it ever came out, the top administrator's in the campus' Old Main building would try to use him as a scapegoat.

'Old Main screwed up,' McQueary recalls Paterno lamenting days after learning of the abuse and the university's failure to report it to police.

Key witness: Mike McQueary, a former Penn State assistant football coach, was a key witness in the Sandusky trial and will also play a major role in the trial of the officials accused of a coverup

Coverup? Legendary head coach Joe Paterno is said to have lamented the fact that university officials didn't call the police on Jerry Sandusky in 2001

McQueary is again the star witness as prosecutors pursue charges against the college's former president, Graham Spanier, 65; its former athletic 
director, Tim Curley, 59; and its former senior vice president Gary 
Schultz, 63.

All three are accused of a 'conspiracy of silence' for allegedly covering up the abuse and refusing to report it to police in an effort to protect the highly lucrative Penn State football program.

Their actions, prosecutors say, allowed Sandusky to continue molesting young boys he recruited and groomed through his charity 'The Second Mile.'

McQueary says he told Paterno, Curley and Schultz in February 2001 that he had witnessed Sandusky raping a young boy in the showers at a practice facility. Prosecutors allege that the three top administrators

'I had seen Jerry Sandusky engaged in a very bad sexual act, a molestation act, with a minor,' McQueary testified he told Paterno.

He also testified that he told other university officials about the incident - including two of the three officials appearing at Monday's hearing. None reported it to police.

Charged: Former president Graham Spanier, top, former vice president Gary Schultz, left, and former athletic director Tim Curley are on trial

Sandusky, 69, a former assistant football coach, was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 boys. He is serving a sentence of 30 years to 60 years in a state prison.

McQueary lost his job as a receivers coach after charges were filed against Sandusky in November 2011.

McQueary, who testified he also told Curley and Schultz of the shower incident, said Paterno told him in the months following the shower incident 'Old Main screwed up,' using a nickname for the administrative center of Penn State.

Sandusky was arrested in November 2011 and charged with molesting boys. A year later, in November 2012, a grand jury charged Spanier, Curley and Schultz with endangering the welfare of children, criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Spanier also was charged with perjury.

Curley and Schultz were previously charged in November 2011 with perjury and failure to report suspected abuse.

Spanier was fired from Penn State; Curley was placed on administrative leave and Schultz had already retired from the school.

Graham Spanier, who was fired as president of Penn State, says he was never told of the sex abuse allegations

Harrisburg District Judge William Wenner will decide if there is enough evidence to bring the case to trial after the preliminary hearing.

Within weeks of Sandusky's arrest, Penn State Trustees fired Spanier, at the time the nation's highest-paid public university president. Trustees also fired Paterno, Sandusky's boss. Months later, Paterno, a legendary figure in college football died of lung cancer at the age of 85.

Civil lawsuits filed by the victims, now grown men, against the university are close to being settled, with the school putting aside $60 million to cover the claims, according to a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. The attorney said there were as many as 32 claims from alleged victims.

McQueary also has filed a whistleblower and defamation lawsuit against Penn State, accusing the school of not renewing his contract because he cooperated with authorities investigating Sandusky and the Penn State officials.

And, Spanier's lawyers have served legal notice that they intend to file defamation charges against Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Freeh was the author of a study, commissioned by the university, spelling out a narrative of the scandal that many in the state rejected, including the Paterno family.

The Freeh report prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for college sports, to issue sanctions against Penn State. The NCAA imposed a $60 million fine and voided the 14 seasons of football victories Sandusky coached.
