A bus driver has been named as British most prolific father - after it emerged he has 26 children with nine different women.

Michael Redman first became a father aged 21 in 1976, when his first wife gave birth to a baby girl.

Since then, his eight subsequent partners have given birth to another  25 children, with his most recent born just last year, it emerged today.

Michael Redman, pictured with seven of his 26 children this year, is said to be Britain's most prolific father 

Mr Redman's first child was born in 1976 and his most recent  was born last year and is now nine months old

He fathered three children in 1988 alone and had two children in 1991 and another pair of youngsters in 1998.

The 58-year-old former solider now has 13 sons and 13 daughters, aged from nine months to 38 years old.

Redman, who is based at the Guildford bus depot in Surrey, now lives with his current partner and their seven children in the nearby village of Ash.

Neighbours  of one of Mr Redman's ex-wives today said he moved out of the former family home about a year ago after his wife discovered how many children he had with other women.

The local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'He was hardly ever home, and now we know why.

'I knew he moved out about a year ago but I didn't know he has since had another child. It is bizarre. It really is shocking. I can't really work out why he has got all these women.' 

It was reported today that Mr Redman uses his 'charm' to meet women while working as a bus driver

A former partner said she was kept in the dark over the size of his brood, but was shocked when she found out

The Sun reported today that Mr Redman, who has worked as a milkman and a builder, has met some of his lovers while working on the buses.

One woman who has children with him told the paper: 'He is charismatic and charming. He tells you what you want to hear. It took me a long time to find out what was really going on.'

The woman said she was unaware how many other children he had, but was astonished when she found out. 

Redman, who neighbours say drives a BMW, recently returned from holiday in Cornwall with his current partner and latest seven children. The family needed two cars to make the journey.

Mr Redman was seen taking passengers around Surrey on a Number 53 bus today after he was named as Britain's most prolific father

Neighbours at his former home said a previous he moved away from a previous wife after the number of children he had fathered emerged

Mr Redman's number of children put him on a par with 12th century monarch Henry I, who is believed to have had 26 children with his wife, Matilda, and various mistresses.

Welsh painter Augustus John is often quoted as British most prolific father in history and is said to have had around 100 illegitimate children before his death in 1961.

Ismail Ibn Sharif, a 17th and 18th century King of Morocco, is believed to have the most children in history, siring 525 sons and 342 sons, according to records.

When approached before starting work this morning, Mr Redman declined to comment.

After learning of his large brood, one of his regular passengers said: 'I can't believe it. You wouldn't think of it to look at him - he's not exactly George Clooney is he?'

The bus driver has fathered the huge brood with nine women, including seven children with his current partner

Mr Redman has been in the Army and worked as a milkman but is currently based at Guildford bus depot
