A Herediano player was reportedly left requiring hospital treatment after an off-the-ball kick to the head during the CONCAFAF Champions League semi-final between the Costa Rican club and Club America.

The feisty game descended into a mass brawl lasting five minutes after Club America midfielder Michael Arroyo left Herediano's Cristhiam Lagos on the floor with a nasty tackle in the 24th minute.

However, while players argued the referee missed what is believed to have been an unintentional but full blooded kick at Lagos' head by Club America defender Paolo Goltz in an effort to clear the ball from near the prone striker.

Arroyo was eventually sent off but Goltz escaped punishment - while Lagos was left nursing a bloodied nose but continued to play on before being replaced by Argentine Jonathan Hansen after 78minutes.

According to Diez, Lagos later fainted in the dressing room before being taken to hospital where he spent the night undergoing tests for brain damage.

The Herediano club doctor Alvaro Mora later confirmed the 30-year-old had suffered only a broken nose and would soon be released from care, although he is expected to spend a spell on the sidelines.
