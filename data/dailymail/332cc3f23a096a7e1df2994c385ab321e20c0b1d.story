Filmmaker Brett Ratner has turned his attention away from Hollywood blockbusters this month to produce a glossy television commercial for Blade's new airport helicopter transfer service, Bounce.

Blade, a short-distance aviation app which launched last year as a fast way to get to the Hamptons, is now offering customers the chance to fly to New York  airports in just minutes for less than $700.

The advert, debuting exclusively with DailyMail.com today, features beard model Luke Ditella picking up his comely date for a quick flight at Blade's swanky heliport lounge on Manhattan's East Side. 

App-based service: Brett Ratner's Bounce advert, debuting exclusively with DailyMail.com, opens with beard model Luke Ditella looking down at his phone to see the words, 'helicopter has arrived', flash up on the screen

Smartening up: Ditella then glances at his watch and straightens his tie (pictured), before picking up his comely date for the short helicopter trip at Blade's swanky heliport lounge on Manhattan's East Side

New focus: Filmmaker Ratner (pictured), who directed the Rush Hour film series and X-Men: The Last Stand, turned his attention away from Hollywood blockbusters this month to produce the glossy commercial

It opens with Ditella looking down at his smartphone to see the words, 'helicopter has arrived', flash up on the screen, alongside the time of his Blade flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport.

He then glances at his watch, before meeting his date in the Blade Lounge and telling her: 'Sorry I'm late'. The woman, wearing a dark blue dress, turns to him and replies: 'Your helicopter. Your rules.'

The pair then climb into a black helicopter at the East 34th Street heliport, which takes off. The 30-second commercial, which ends with  the aircraft flying into the distance, was shot in a single day.

Apology: After walking over to his date, Ditella, dressed in a suit jacket and shirt, tells her: 'Sorry I'm late'

'Your rules': The woman, wearing a dark blue dress, turns to him and replies: 'Your helicopter. Your rules'

Ready to travel: Ditella glances out of the window of the Blade Lounge, at their helicopter, on East 34th Street

Producer Ratner, 45, who directed the Rush Hour film series, X-Men: The Last Stand, The Family Man and Red Dragon, and other crew members lent their talents to the advert for free.

Blade, dubbed 'an Uber for helicopters', offers flights to 'any New York area airport' via its Bounce app. The six-seat aircraft, costing $695 a trip, arrives as soon as 20 minutes after being ordered.

The booking process itself takes no longer than 30 seconds. 

Blade's new commercial will first air on New York television Monday morning.
