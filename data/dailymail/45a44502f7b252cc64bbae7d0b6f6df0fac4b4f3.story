Hacked: The Old Bailey was told that Sven Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager

Sven  Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News of the World for almost his entire tenure as England manager, the Old Bailey heard on Wednesday.

The court was told that Mr Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam were monitored by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high profile stories at the now-defunct tabloid.

Among them was the 65-year-old's affair with FA employee Miss Alam, with the 'first details' of the relationship emerging from hacked messages in June 2004.

The court heard that two hacks by the 
paper came just days before Mr Eriksson was exposed in a sting operation
 'perpetrated' by undercover reporter, so-called Fake Sheikh, Mazher 
Mahmood, which prosecutors say led to a story with the headline 'This 
Man Is A Crook'.

The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign.

Prosecutor
 Mark Bryant-Heron told the jury that when Mulcaire was arrested in 
August 2006 on suspicion of phone hacking, recordings of two voicemail 
messages intercepted from Mr Eriksson's phone were found at his address.

One was from Everton chairman Bill 
Kenwright relating to player transfers, Mr Bryant-Heron told the jury, 
and the other from an Italian player.

The
 court heard that Mr Kenwright had left a message saying: 'I didn't get 
back to you before I signed James Beattie and I wanted to talk to you 
about another of your England players before I sign him.'

Mr Eriksson was the subject of intense
 media scrutiny while managing the England football team between 2001 
and 2006, including coverage of his affair with Miss Alam, which started
 in 2004.

Target: The court was told Glenn Mulcaire, left, monitored Mr Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam, right, between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high-profile stories

Jurors were shown
 the pages from Mulcaire's notebooks from May 2002 which had Mr 
Eriksson's phone number in, but had not at that point been attributed to
 the England boss.

The 
same number cropped up against in August that year in taskings from NoTW
 news editors Neville Thurlbeck and Greg Miskiw, this time with Mr 
Eriksson's name on it.

A
 new phone number for Mr Eriksson was in pages of the notebook from June
 2004, alongside the mobile number and central London address of Miss 
Alam.

Mulcaire had also noted down Miss Alam's PIN and had written down a set of bank details on June 20, 2004.

The expose of the affair between Mr Eriksson and Miss Alam was published in the News of the World on July 18, 2004.

Job: The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign, the jury was told

It was followed the next week with another exclusive that Miss Alam was also sleeping with FA executive Mark Palios, and another follow-up on August 8, 2004 with Alam's thought's on Mr Eriksson's then-partner Nancy Dell'Olio.

Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron showed 
evidence of a string of calls to Mr Eriksson's and Miss Alam's phones 
from Mulcaire, which he said were all evidence of hacking.

This
 included five calls between January 17 and 20, 2006, just before the 
Fake Sheikh expose in which the England boss was duped into a string of 
indiscrete remarks about his future with the national team.

Partnership: The court heard that after the expose of Mr Eriksson's affair, several stories followed - including Miss Alam's thoughts on his then partner Nancy Dell'Olio, right

'It is suggested these phone calls are hacks', said Mr Bryant-Heron.

Jurors were shown two more phone contacts from Mulcaire the following week, then more again into February.

The court heard Mulcaire renewed his interest in June 2006, as England were preparing to play in the World Cup.

He even hacked Mr Eriksson's phone on June 9, 2006, the day before England played their opening game against Paraguay.

The evidence on the hacking of Mr Eriksson's phone will continue on Thursday.

Prank: Nancy Dell'Olio was left embarrassed on Tuesday night when a prankster wearing a Sven Goran Eriksson mask followed her into the Shaka Zulu restaurant in Camden, north London

Go away; Miss Dell'Olio, who split with the football coach in 2007, did not appear to be amused by the mystery man donning a mask of her former partner
