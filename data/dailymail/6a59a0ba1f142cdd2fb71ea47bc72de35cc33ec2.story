A husband arrived home to find his wife murdered, stabbed in the back in what police are investigating as a home invasion robbery gone wrong.

The body of Simeonette Mapes-Crupi, 29, a New York City social studies teacher, was found on Thursday afternoon by her husband Jonathan, 30, at their home on Staten Island.

Reports said that Mrs Mapes-Crupi was found face-down with several stab wounds in her back by the door to their apartment.

The murder occurred in a quiet, tree-lined street in New Springville, across from a golf course where neighbours say crime is scarce.

Police told the Staten Island Advance that there did not appear to be any signs of forced entry at the home, which had been ransacked.

The murder has left the community in shock. As news of the murder spread, numerous onlookers gathered around the couple's apartment, which had been sealed off by police tape.

Local resident Gabrielle Blinderman, 19, told the Advance: 'I don't think anything has really happened like that [in the past].'

Neighbours reported that they didn’t see or hear anything suspicious until her husband made the horrific discovery.

One onlooker, who declined to be identified, told the New York Daily News: 'He’s like, "She’s dead! I came home! It was hot! She was dead!

'She’s dead! She’s dead! It was hot! I wasn’t here. I had to work!"' Another witness told the paper that he came out of the home screaming, 'My wife was murdered!'

Another neighbour, Rachel Havia, 43, said the victim had recently celebrated her birthday, adding: 'Her husband brought her flowers and balloons.'

Another woman, who works nearby and who came across a large crowd on her lunch break, said: 'At first I thought it was a fight.

'Then I thought someone was hurt, because they were like hugging and crying, and people were screaming.'

Gabrielle Blinderman, 19, called the murder 'surreal'. She said: 'I don't think anything has really happened like that in the past'. Her friend Chris Tobias, 18, added: 'That's terrible.'

Linda Tanen also said that the idea that it could have been a random home invasion was especially frightening.

She added: 'Nothing happens here. You're across the street from a golf course, and all you have is people golfing. Everybody is in their own world.'

Mrs Mapes-Crupi was a teacher since 2009 at an East New York high school called School for Classics: An Academy of Thinkers, Writers and Performers

It is described as a 'tough' high 
school, where her husband also teaches English. Last month, she received
a Master of Science degree in adolescent education from the College of 
Staten Island, according to Advance records.

Just last week, Mrs Crupi spoke of a scary incident when she posted on Facebook that she and her husband had witnessed a shootout near the school they teach at.

She wrote on June 28: ‘[My husband] and I survived a shoot out today...Thank God we are ok, I'm sure over summer school we'll find out what the fighting was about'

'To all the wanna be gangstas of Staten Island (who say they are from Brooklyn but really aren't), be grateful you have what you have and stop trying to live a lifestyle you will never understand.'

Her friends made several comments on her post, to which she replied: 'It’s just a hazard of working in East NY, Brooklyn. Things like this makes you appreciate all the blessings you have.'
