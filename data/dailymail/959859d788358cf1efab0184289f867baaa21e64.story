A pair of Danish artists have created a magical chandelier that turns a room into a forest using a trick of the light.

Vast leafy shadows are thrown onto the 
walls as light shines through the mirrored sculpture, while different 
types of woodland can be created by turning the dimmer switch up and 
down.

Thyra Hilden and Pio Diaz are the creative brains behind the Forms in Nature light sculpture, which was inspired by the drawings of German naturalist, Ernst Haeckel.

Spectacular: Hilden & Diaz' Forms in Nature sculpture creates a virtual forest on the walls of a room

Magical: The artwork creates a network of shadowy roots and gnarled trees using light

Stylish: The designer duo say they expect the chandelier to go on sale in a few months time

'Using a simple action, such as intensifying the brightness at the centre of the artwork, the light transforms the space and adds character, as the work throws oversized shadows onto walls and ceilings in the space in which it hangs,' say the duo on their website.

'As the intensity of the light source increases, the room changes and the space slowly becomes more and more fascinating and uncanny.

'The shadow engulfs the room and transforms the walls into unruly shadows of branches, bushes and gnarled trees.'

The piece is made from specially made hardened plastic powder which can withstand the heat from the LED lamp.

Components were then created using the computer and built with a 3D printer.

'When we did Forms In Nature we were very much inspired by the German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel, who did astonishing work in cataloguing both plants and animals,' Diaz told MailOnline.

'We fell in love with the vastness of nature and how insignificant and consumed man can feel in the face of roaring seas, deep forests and the endless sky.

'The work of the German painter Casper Friedrich and his romantic depiction of man facing the immensity of the wild was also a great source of inspiration to us.

'With Forms In Nature we wanted to create much the same feeling one might have when standing in a magnificent forest surrounded by nature.

'What I like about Forms In Nature is that you are not looking at the art-piece, but rather you are present in it and surrounded by it through the light and the shadows.'

Elaborate: The delicate sculpture was inspired by the drawings of German naturalist, Ernst Haeckel

The designers, who have worked in partnership since 2005, say their focus is on transformation and paradoxes - a philosophy that also informs their other works.

Among them is City of Fire, a video installation that involved setting famous monuments virtually ablaze, and Bubble - an artistic attempt to preserve a soap bubble forever.

'For many years it has been of our interest to question the cultural structures through destructive forces such as fire,' say the pair.

'Lately, our interest has shifted to its radical pole, that is, how to preserve the most fragile things existing despite all odds.'

Although the piece is not available to buy commercially, the pair say the sculpture can be ordered individually via email.
