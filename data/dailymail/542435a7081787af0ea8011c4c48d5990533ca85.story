The leader of Germany's opposition party wants to introduce free summer holidays for those on benefits. 

Katja Kipping, leader of Die Linke party, said every German on benefits should get free travel vouchers worth 500 euros - the equivalent of £400. 

Ms Kipping told Welt newspaper: 'For me, the holidays of my childhood are among the most beautiful memories.

According to the politician, one in five Germans cannot afford to take a holiday which includes half of all single parents.

She said she was personally saddened by the fact that 'three million children this summer cannot experience what a holiday means.'

'All people on low incomes, benefits and housing allowance claimants should receive vouchers which they can redeem for holidays, either in hostels, railway tickets for travel or in a travel agency.'

Die Linke is considered by many in Germany to be the most far-left and is the largest opposition party against Angela Merkel's coalition. However, it only has 64 seats out of 630.

Angel Merkel's CDU party dismissed the proposal as 'lump sum holiday collectivism.' 

However, there has been more widespread cross-party support for the German state to do more to ensure children do have the opportunity to travel. 

Children from disadvantage families should be offered two weeks free stay at a summer camp or holiday camp she added - an idea reminiscent of the state-organised holidays under the communist regime in the former East Germany. 

The number of people registered as unemployed in Germany fell by 12,000 to 2.901 million in April. 

In comparison, the number of people out of work in Britain fell to 2.12 million this July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
