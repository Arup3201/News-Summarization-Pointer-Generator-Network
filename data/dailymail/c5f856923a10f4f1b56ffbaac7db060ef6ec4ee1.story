Americans have started to use the word 'queue' instead of 'in line' - and its all because of Netflix.

Queue, widely used in Britain, is also common in the technology community in both countries.

Now Netflix, an American company which has 33million members who stream movies and TV shows on demand, has chosen to use the word to describe the line-up of videos, it has started to cross into the vernacular.

List: Netflix members have to upload a movie or TV programme into a 'queue' when they want to watch it

The reason stems from the sites system where, if a user wants to watch a video, they have to upload it in a 'queue'.

Before, Americans referred to a queue as a 'line' and referred to people queuing as people 'waiting in line'.

Almost the only time they would have encountered the word previously would be in technology, such as a printer queue.

Lynne Murphy, a reader in linguistics at Sussex University said: 'There is more of a trend towards British words being used in America.

'The Netflix queue, like a printer queue or a queue on a phone is a virtual queue, and that usage is pretty well established in computer jargon. This looks like an extension of computer jargon.'

Despite sharing a common language, Britain and America sometimes do not use the same words when talking about one thing. Here are some examples:

Dumpster (US) v skip (UK)

Truck (US) v lorry (UK)

Trunk (US) v boot (UK)

Grading (US) v marking (UK) - exams/papers

Hood (US) v bonnet (UK)

Pacifier (US) v dummy (UK)

Diaper (US) v nappy (UK)

Stroller (US) v pram (UK)

Trash (US) v rubbish

Tank top (US) v vest (UK)

Vest (US) vs Waistcoat (UK

According to New Republic, in Google searches in the U.S. since 2004, the word most commonly associated with 'queue' is 'Netflix,'

Orin Hargreaves, lexicographer at the University of Colorado Boulder told the site: 'A lot more words travel back and forth and get established in the other dialect than they ever did before, mainly because of media and the Internet.'

Hulu, another streaming site, has introduced its own 'queue' function, and Amazon has adopted the term, too, inviting users to advertise the books they plan to read in a 'Book Queue.'

In the media the New York Times has used 'queue' in reference to Fort Lee traffic, SXSW registration, and patrons of a San Francisco restaurant.

The Washington Post also used it to refer to check-in lanes at Reagan National Airport in.

Reporter Lori Aratani wrote, the 'long narrow hallway' at Terminal A 'limited the number of passengers who could queue for screening.'

Drama: The site has attracted 33million members since it was founded in 1997 and has produced its own shows including American political drama, House of Cards

Star-studded: The series, starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, was given four Golden Globe nominations, the first major accolade for an online-only series

Orange Is The New Black was also released exclusively on Netflix. It is a comedy based on a woman's experience in prison

Netlfix have renewed the programme, which stars Taylor Schilling, for a second series and is due to start later this year
