Before she fell in love with a 10-year-old boy pupil, tattooed his name on her chest and made him she had cast a spell on him, primary school teacher, Diane Brimble, had once been described as a selfless ‘supermum’.

Brimble, a mother of eight who lured the boy to her rose-covered home in country Victoria for sex, is expected to escape prison when she is sentenced on Thursday for what her victim’s parents describe as ‘evil’ acts upon their son.

Just two years after graduating from university to take her ‘dream come true’ job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys.

The mother of children aged nine to 27 years and believer in spells and magic had a framed photo of the boy on his bedside table and designed a tattoo with the words ‘love for’ and his name in an infinity symbol.

Hamilton mother-of-eight Diane Brimble attempted to have sex with a 10-year-old male student in her house, and had photos of him on her phone, the Victorian County Court heard on Monday.

 

Brimble faced court charged with five counts of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years, and one charge of using a telecommunications device to groom a child. She pleaded not guilty to all six charges.

Brimble so influenced the boy, his parents said that he believed she could control his thoughts and he ended up so traumatised he had to be medicated.

During a trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting ‘bizarre’conduct and a baffling’ psycho sexual profile’.

Crown prosecutor Patrick Bourke told the court the boy victim had described physical contact with Brimble as ‘weird’ or ‘bad’.

Mr Bourke said Brimble told the boy she loved him, called him her boyfriend, said she wanted to sleep with him, offered him vodka and opened a suitcase and showed him sex toys, truth-or-dare cards and a pregnancy test. 

He said Brimble had feelings for or an infatuation for the boy and wrote poetry, letters and sent him Facebook messages. She had a photo of him in her locket, 20 photos of him on her mobile phone, one of which as the phone’s screen saver.

She also wanted to be buried with a photo of him and a pipe cleaner ring he had given her.

Police say Brimble hugged him all over and kissed him, and when he said he wasn’t old enough to have sex she said, ‘you are when you’re at my house’.

Mr Bourke said that when the boy moved to a different school, Brimble tried to enrol some of her own children at his new school.

A jury took two days to find her not guilty of the child grooming charge and four other charges, but convicted her of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex.

In the court, the boy’s mother made a victim impact statement, saying Brimble she was disgusted when she heard about the chest tattoo with her boy’s name on it and that Brimble had ‘stolen his innocence’.

She said the boy had self-harmed as a result of ‘a hell Brimble’s predatory actions thrust upon him’.

‘I feel sickened – as a mother – that she did this under the guise of motherly love.’

‘The commemorative tattoo etched into her body of my child’s name in the symbol of infinity, couple with her belief in spells and spirits makes me convinced that she truly believes she is meant to be united in dreams for eternity,’ the mother said.

She described how while the boy’s siblings drew pictures of rainbows and unicorns, her son had started drawing knives and scenes featuring death.

In a victim impact statement read out in court, the boy’s father said his son’s trust had been destroyed, the family had had to move and his son had to repeat his education because of Brimble’s predatory behaviour.

He said his son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, said Brimble was on him’.

‘She tried to manipulate [him] to make him think she loved him and his parents did not,’ the statement read out by prosecutor Patrick Bourke said.

‘I feel sick every time I think of my son’s name tattooed on her body.’

Judge Mark Taft said Brimble had driven the boy to her house where she offered him sex, but he had rejected his advances.

‘I find Ms Brimble’s conduct as bizarre as any I have seen in a courtroom, ‘ he said.

Barrister Jennifer Clark, on behalf of Brimble, said her client had developed an affection beyond the normal teacher/student relationship, ‘but she has not overstepped into criminal conduct’.

Ms Clark said Brimble had endured a difficult life and an abusive marriage which she had fought hard to overcome by becoming a teacher.

In 2011, following her graduation from Deakin University, Brimble told the Warrnambool Standard that she had fought hard to gain her degree, attending classes while her youngest child was still a toddler and making a two-hour return commute up to four times a week.

She had achieved her dream of completing tertiary education after finishing her high school certificate as a mature age student by correspondence over two years.

Described as a ‘supermum’, who had sat exam at the same time as her two eldest children, Brimble said she had completed her studies with the support of friends and university lecturers.

‘It was a bit tiring but it was all worth it,’ she said.

‘I guess I always wanted to be a teacher and finally set out to achieve that.’

The Victorian Institute of Teaching, which has already suspended Brimble from teaching, is expected to strip her of her right to teach and disqualify her for life.

Brimble, who will be sentenced in the Victorian County Court in Melbourne at 10am on Thursday, will likely never teach again.

Brimble has been assessed for a community corrections order and has undergone a psychological report.
