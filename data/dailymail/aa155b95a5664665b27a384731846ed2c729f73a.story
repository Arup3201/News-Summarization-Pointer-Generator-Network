Tragedy: Jay Whiston, 17, from Clacton, Essex, died after being stabbed during a house party in Colchester

The 'old fashioned' parents who allowed their daughter to hold a party which led to the murder of a teenager have said they took 'every precaution possible' to keep the event under control.

Paul and Jeanette Gathercole, who call themselves 'fuddy duddy', allowed their daughter, Laura, to hold the party to mark the start of her GCSE year at a respected Colchester school.

But the parents were left stunned when their carefully controlled event - which their daughter had advertised on Facebook under a private invite setting - spiralled out of control.

It ended in tragedy as 17-year-old Jay Whiston was stabbed to death just yards from their house.

Mr and Mrs Gathercole, who have lived at the property in a leafy suburb for 21 years, supervised the proceedings and even went as far as to place hazard tape around their garden and marked out steps so no one would fall over.

Mrs Gathercole said: 'We took every precaution we possibly could to make sure it was a safe party.

'We are quite old-fashioned parents, quite fuddy-duddy.

'We really did to everything by the book - the party started at 7.30pm and we had soft drink and food there.

'We were supervising it the whole time and patrolled the conservatory and kitchen and the parts of the garden where the children were allowed to go.

'The rest of the house was marked off with hazard tape - we put tape around the slabs in the garden so no-one would hurt themselves.'

Mr Gathercole, who works at an Audi dealership in Chelmsford, said everything had been under tight control but at 9.30pm they had stopped one youngster that Laura did not know from entering the party.

Within 20 minutes Jay had been stabbed in the stomach with a single blow that killed him.

Mr Gathercole said: 'We did not see what happened as the first we knew of it was when the paramedics arrived.

The family said about 100 teens had attended the party, which Laura had set up through Facebook using a private invite setting.

Their daughter Laura had sent out 
notes to neighbours warning them that she was throwing a party and 
apologising for any noise in advance.

She insisted her Facebook page had specifically been created so strangers could not access the details.

She said: 'I had a private page which could only be accessed by invited people - it was not a public Facebook page.

'The guests were allowed to bring a 'plus one' but they had to ask first.'

Laura said she did not know Jay, who lived in Clacton, but said he had come with a friend of hers.

She added: 'There were about three or 
four people who I did not recognise at the party so I asked who they 
were - I checked with them all.'

Grief: Mrs Shearer broke down in tears as she spoke about her son Jay Whiston's death

Killing: Police at the scene in Colchester where Jay Whiston was stabbed to death during a house party

Devastated: Jay Whiston's friend Shannon Summers, who was at the party, visits the house in Colchester, Essex, where the gathering was held to lay flowers at the scene where he was killed

The teen said most of the invites had 
gone out to fellow pupils at Colchester County High School for Girls, an
institution which is renowned for achieving some of the best GCSE and A-level results nationally.

Other invites were sent to pals from the nearby St Benedict’s College and Philip Morant School.

Mrs Gathercole said her family had been left feeling numb following the killing on Saturday night.

She said: 'We are devastated and our thoughts are with Jay’s family.

'We would like to express our sincere condolences to them.

'We have passed them to his family through the police’s family liaison officer.'

Their horror at the party that raged 
out of control comes as the mother of the teenager stabbed in the heart 
launched a fierce attack on the soft justice meted out for knife crime 
in Britain.

Caroline Shearer, 47, called for the death of her son to spur a fight back against the growing knife culture.

Two
months ago official figures revealed just one in every five 
knife-wielding thugs is being jailed, despite a pre-election promise by 
the Tories to jail anyone caught carrying a blade.

Mrs
Shearer told the Mail: ‘Knife crime is getting out of control. Kids are
being injured and murdered. Innocent children are dying.

Alcohol: Bottles of booze leftover from the party were still in the street outside the house

Scene: A house in Marlowe Way, Colchester, is sealed off as part of the murder investigation

Cordoned off: Police carrying out investigations at the scene of stabbing, which has been surrounded by cordons and police cars

Hopes: Jay Whiston wanted to marry, have children and be a pawnbroker like his father, his mother said

Being tough on crime isn’t a sign of an uncaring society. It is a sign of a caring society.

‘Any parent knows the easiest thing in the world is to say to a child to go off and do what they want. It is hard to say no.’

The
Tories scrapped their tough line on knife crime after coming to power 
because of concerns about cost and a higher prison population.

Mrs Shearer, a full-time foster carer
from Clacton, Essex, added: ‘It’s typical of politicians. It’s all 
about getting votes and then they change their minds.

‘But money shouldn’t stand in the way of saving lives.'

Mrs Shearer broke down in tears as 
she told ITV’s Daybreak how she fussed over Jay before he went to the 
party, insisting he had some pizza so he would not leave on an empty 
stomach.

Describing the last moment she saw him, she said: ‘I kissed him. That was it. The last time.’

She added: ‘This can’t go on. Parents
have to take more responsibility of knowing where their children are. 
Knowing what their children are doing.

‘Two days ago I had a son, singing quite happily, a bit grumpy, teenager, normal. But now what have I got? An empty shell.’

Jay’s father, Stafford, described his son as his ‘hero’ yesterday.

‘If you could pick a son, you would 
pick him. Jay was the best,’ he said. Jay was killed on Saturday night 
outside the £450,000 detached house in Colchester where the party was 
held.

Two 18-year-old men and a 17-year-old boy, all from Colchester, have been arrested.
