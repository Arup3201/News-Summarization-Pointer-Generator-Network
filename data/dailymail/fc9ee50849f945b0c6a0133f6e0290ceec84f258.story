Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough has warned that Tottenham Hotspur face the threat of another cup upset on Wednesday, claiming that Barclays Premier League teams don’t take the knock-out competitions as seriously as those in the lower divisions.

Chelsea and Manchester City crashed out of the FA Cup on a weekend of shocks that also saw Spurs lose at home to Leicester.

Now Clough wants to pile on the misery for Mauricio Pochettino’s side by guiding his League One underdogs to victory in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Bramall Lane.

The 48-year-old believes that City’s decision to take a long-haul flight back from Abu Dhabi the day before their shock defeat against Middlesbrough is typical of how top-flight teams and their players view the domestic cup competitions.

‘I think it’s all down to the Premier League lads not taking the cups as seriously as the other players,’ said Clough.

‘The cups are so important to lower-league players, and I don’t think that’s matched in the Premier League.

‘I don’t think they regard it with the same importance, even when they put a full side out.

‘Whatever Man City want to do is their business, but to have a seven-and-a-half-hour flight the day before a game? I wonder if they’d do that for a Champions League game.

‘Would they fly back on Friday from Abu Dhabi before they play Chelsea this Saturday?

‘We can take inspiration from the weekend, certainly. It puts everyone on high alert. Anyone now who is facing a lower-league team, don’t take them lightly because, on their day, they can do things like Saturday.

‘Manchester United started it off (drawing at Cambridge) on Friday night. Things like that give you belief and inspiration. You watch a game and you go to bed thinking “come on, we can do this tomorrow”. It’s amazing how it works in players’ minds.’

Clough’s side trail Spurs 1-0 from the first-leg but he has yet to lose a cup tie at home during his 15 months in charge of the Blades.

The South Yorkshire club progressed to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley last season and have already beaten three Premier League teams – West Ham, Southampton and QPR – in the knockout tournaments in this campaign.

Clough is determined to make life as uncomfortable as possible for his opponents at a packed Bramall Lane.

‘We’re at home and 25,000 of the 30,000 will be cheering us on, that will make a difference,’ he added.

‘It’s a different kind of atmosphere and a different kind of football than they’ re used to. Even in the big Premier League games, it can be a little bit of a damp squib.

‘The pitch quality isn’t as good as they’re used to playing on week in, week out. We’ve got to make it everything they’re not comfortable with.

‘I’m sure Spurs will be aware of the sort of game it could be for them. There’s a few lads who’ve been out on loan and they’ll know what it’s about – Danny Rose, (Andros) Townsend, (Aaron) Lennon, (Ryan) Mason’s a good young English midfielder, Kyle Walker. They’ve got a few with that sort of experience and they’re probably going to need it.’

However, Clough is refusing to look beyond tonight’s tie to the possibility of a Wembley return on March 1.

‘I’ve honestly not even thought about getting that far,’ admitted. ‘I was speaking to the chairman at Burton Albion about getting together for lunch on a Sunday and he said “give us a couple of dates”.

‘I gave him a couple and he said “that one’s okay, but the other one, I’m hoping to be cheering you on at Wembley!”.’
