Terrified Romans living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them.

The description was penned in a letter by a Roman named Pliny the younger who watched from a safe distance to describe the panic on the fateful day of August 24 in 79AD, which was immortalised beneath ash spewed from the erupting volcano, Mount Vesuvius.

Now, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town of Pompeii have discovered raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster.

The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired, Discovery News reported. 

It looks as if they were dropped as frightened potters saw the smoke and smelt the sulphurous fumes that would have been spewed out by the volcano - and decided to make a run for it.

Historical accounts and archaeological evidence show that many Pompeians took to the streets in a bid to leave the city, braving hot ash and pumice stones ejected from Vesuvius, with some collapsing from inhaling poisonous fumes.

Roman writer, Pliny the younger, described the panic during the eruption of Mount Vessuvius. Terrified Romans (illustrated) living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them, he said

The scene at the pottery, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate. One of the kilns (pictured left) and a reconstructed broken vase (right) are shown

The pottery was discovered in an area of the town outside its Herculaneum Gate and comprises three rooms housing two large kilns. 

The scene at the workshop, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate.

Dig director Laëtitia Cavassa, from the Jean Bérard Centre, said: ‘They abandoned the workshop and everything they were doing at that moment.’ 

An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century.

His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares.

He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night.

People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours.

While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse.

An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life.

Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly.

As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge.

While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.

Archaeologists found pottery wheels as well as the tools needed to create the elaborate patterns and textures on the pots and vases.

They believe that the 10 smashed vessels discovered were intended to be used to hold water and wine.

Dr Cavassa said: ‘They are really unique items. The potters made them with clay, embellished them with decorations, and were ready to place them into the kiln when the Vesuvius erupted.’

She explained that the vases are evidence that the workshop was active at the moment of the famous eruption.

The city of Pompeii (pictured) is an invaluable resource to historians because so many tiny details of daily life, from food to objects in houses, were preserved by hot ash when Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city
