This could be the perfect gift for the billionaire who has almost everything.

A mystery seller has put an idyllic and isolated Greek island in Khora on the market for £29million, but it does not even come with a house.

However, the astonishing collection of islets, inlets and bays surrounding the larger island in the Aegean Sea off the coast of the Greek mainland are all included in the price.

Splendid isolation: The luxurious Greek island is surrounded by clear blue seas in the middle of the Aegean Sea

And at 86 and a half acres, of 50 football pitches in size, the private island offers almost unrivalled tranquillity from the normal day-to-day hustle and bustle of the life of the mega rich.

With almost four million square foot of empty land to enjoy, owners would have more than enough space for guests to enjoy a few margaritas under the Greek island sunshine.

The island is only accessible via boat, jettys were built by the previous mystery owner.

But if the lucky buyer ends up feeling
 like a castaway, they can hop on a speed boat and take a short 30 
minute trip from Khora to the bustling Greek capital of Athens.

A
 spokesperson for Sotheby's said: 'A number of international developers 
have shown great interest due to its unique location and proximity to 
Athens.

'It is appropriate for all uses such as residential for villas or hospitality units and is a truly unique purchase.'

Tranquillity: A slice of pristine white sandy beach all to yourself, not far from the Greek mainland, is being offered for £29million

Sparse: Despite the hefty price tag of £29million, there is little on the island in the form of modern amenities or facilities

Clear blue water: Any buyer would have miles of uninterrupted views across the Aegean Sea to the Greek mainland

Rugged: The island has almost no development on it - except for a few small buildings and coastal pathways

Unspoilt: Rising from the Aegean Sea, the island has acres of rugged land to wander amongst

Idyllic: The island is located in Khora, Greece, surrounded by the warm and tranquil Aegean Sea

Detached: The only way to access this stunning Greek island is by boat and once on shore there are no buildings or structures on the island other than the access points
