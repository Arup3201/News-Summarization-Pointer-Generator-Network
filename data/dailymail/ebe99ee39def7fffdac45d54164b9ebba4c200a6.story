A rehoming centre is looking for new owners for the 12 dogs of Christmas - a dozen puppies from the same litter who are just six weeks old.

Their owner could not cope with the American bulldog-cross puppies and decided the best thing to do was to give them to a rehoming centre in Southampton.

Six girls and six boys make up the litter of a dozen puppies and the playful pets have all been given festive names.

Mary, Holly, Ivy, Robin, Elf and Tinsel are the females - while the males have been named Joseph, Noel, Rudolph, Frosty, Snowy and Gabriel.

Laura Boyle, 26, rehoming supervisor, said: 'The cute puppies were brought into the centre by the owner as she couldn't cope with the numbers.

'She had kids of her own and had just had a baby, I think it became a bit too much for her.'

The 12 puppies are being cared for at the Blue Cross centre in Southampton, Hampshire.Â

Ms Boyle added: 'They are such lovely
 puppies, they are very playful and the decision to call them festive 
names could help with the rehoming.

'There is a very big mixture in the litter - some of the pups are brindle and white, tan and white and just brindle.

'But
 I want to stress that a dog is never just for Christmas and we would 
urge the whole family to be on board when adopting a pet.

'This could be a 15-year commitment so families should really make sure they are making the correct decision.

'But I'm sure it will be worth it. They are a playful bunch and are very happy.'

Ms Boyle added: 'They have just started to go outside and I'm sure they will make amazing pets.

'At the moment, everyone is talking about Christmas and most people are beginning to get excited.

'Hopefully the festive names will encourage people to give a cute puppy the home it deserves this year.'
