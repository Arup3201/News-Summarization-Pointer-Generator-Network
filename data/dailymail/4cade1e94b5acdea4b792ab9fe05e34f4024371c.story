E-readers may be in but if anything's going to get Britain reading proper books again, it may well be naked book club.

The tastefully-executed event involves a group of beautiful women reading aloud various books, poems and novels - only paper form allowed - in the nude.

After starting out in Chicago, Naked Girls Reading franchises have made their way around the world, finally reaching the UK in 2011.

The event involves a group of women reading aloud from themed books, poems and novels, entirely in the nude

For a small fee listeners get to relax, absorb the story and even join in with discussions mid-reading - but they're not required to join in and remove their clothes!

Head Naked Girl Sophia St. Villier, who has been running the London branch since its inception in March 2011, tells us about naked story time.

'I love picking an interesting theme 
and researching literature that ties in with the theme. I usually have 
one or two performers in addition to myself. I pick the pieces of 
literature that we read as a group and each performer picks three pieces
 of literature to read from individually.

'It's
 great because this show pushes and inspires me to read some incredible 
literature - it's so easy to just read articles online or trashy 
magazines.

'I love that we read proper books. Naked
 Girls Reading is an electronic reader-free zone. 

'The show is around 2.5 hours long with 
two 10-minute breaks. People normally sip a glass of wine or a cocktail 
while they listen to the readings. I have a decadent show planned for 
the future where wine, chocolate and cognac is matched to stories.

'My favourite themes so
 far have been Bedtime Stories, Banned Books, Fairy Tales and Art - this
 show combined readings and life drawing.

'One
 of the highlights so far has been my friend Abigail Collins reading her
 own short stories at the Valentine's Show in 2013, and unbeknownst to 
us, a literary agent was in the audience who signed Abigail to write two
 novels.'

Naked Girls Reading was founded in Chicago by burlesque 
artist Michelle L'amour and her partner Franky Vivid. Sophia  spoke with the couple about 
producing a show in London and, after an interview process, was 
granted the London franchise.

Sophia St. Villier produces
 two shows in London, Blackest Noir, a comic burlesque film noir show 
and Naked Girls Reading - a literary salon with a twist.

Sophia
 has performed for Will.i.am at Playboy Club London's 1st Birthday 
alongside Professor Green, for Sky Atlantic for the Boardwalk Empire 
launch, at House and Lost director Greg Yaitanes' wedding in France and 
at Hampton Court Palace. Sophia was recently in Franz Ferdinand's Love 
Illumination video clip. Sophia is originally from New Zealand and lives
 in East London.

'I now produce shows 
for the London branch, the first outside 
of North America,' says Sophia.

And ever since coming to the UK, Naked Girls Reading's popularity has soared.

'We have different theme for each show. I love producing and performing in it as
 it involves two things I appreciate - good literature and beautiful 
women.

'The show has grown more and more popular, so much so as we've had
 to change venues to accommodate our audience.'

Sophia, who also works as a burlesque artist and pin-up model, explains the readers' beauty look.

'We often style our hair and makeup in 
accordance with the theme.

'For example, for the Naked Girls Reading Scary Stories show [performer] Crimson Skye and I wore dramatic, terrifying 
makeup.

'For the Naked Girls Reading Banned Books and Valentine's Day 
shows we wore our makeup in our usual style which is inspired by 
mid-century fashions, the 1930s, 40s and 50s - red lips, dark eyes and 
false eyelashes.'

'Worldwide, performers style themselves 
appropriately to the theme of a show.

'Personally, I wear vintage 
clothing and makeup day-to-day, so I bring an element of this to the 
Naked Girls Reading London shows.

'For my 
burlesque acts, I love taking inspiration from glamourous, Golden Age 
Hollywood stars Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich and Hedy Lamarr and 
classic burlesque artists Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr and Blaze Starr.'

'The audience is made up of couples, groups of friends and a few people who come by themselves,' she says.

'We have audience members that come to each show - they must love the literature, as they've already seen us naked! With burlesque shows, the audience is roughly 70 per cent women, 30 per cent men. For Naked Girls Reading, it's around 50 per cent women and 50 per cent men.

'The most common comment I hear from audience members is that after the first 10 minutes they forget we are naked and get lost in the story.

'People love being read to and many haven't experienced that since childhood.

'It's a fun show and discussions often occur with the audience between readings. During our Banned Books show, we asked the audience to guess why each book had been banned - our audience could not believe that James and the Giant Peach was banned due to sexual inferences and references to drugs!

'One of the funniest times was when I was reading a  book of scary urban legends at our Scary Stories show - the legends were so ridiculous, I couldn't stop laughing and the audience had the giggles too. Our fans often write in requesting themes which we take on board. And no, the audience are not naked, only the performers are.'

The next show - Naked Girls Reading Rock and Roll - is on 25 February 2014 at ProudCamden, NW1 8AH - expect Bowie and Kiss makeup, rock biographers and maybe evennaked air guitar.
