A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature's incredible tongue acrobatics.

Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill.

To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.

A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket

The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet.

The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring.

When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes.

This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed.

Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius.

Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. 

Lifespan: Two to five years

Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months.

Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth.  

The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. 

With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself.

In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion.

The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved.

Previous studies didn’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said.

When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.
