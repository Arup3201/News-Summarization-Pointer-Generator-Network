With his white lab coat, Prince Harry almost managed to blend in with the rest of the scientists as he toured a laboratory.

But a huge embroidered 'HRH' across the back of his lab coat meant that their was no way he would be able to able to slip in unnoticed as he visited a research centre specialising in the treatment and recovery for bomb blast victims.

And just to make sure everyone knew of his presence, he even detonated his own explosion.

Prince Harry is shown around the the Shock Tube Laboratory, where he was shown simulations of blast shockwaves and their effects on cells by Dr James Wilgeroth

During the visit Prince Harry set off a shock tube explosion of his own, which created a loud bang

After staff presented him with a lab 
coat embroidered with HRH, as well as ear defenders and eye protectors, 
he toured the laboratories and met the team on Wednesday.

The
prince grinned as he set off a device which detonated a shock tube to 
simulate an explosion, which created a shockwave and produced a loud 
bang.

Prince Harry was given special personalised equipment to wear on the visit

He was appearing at the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies at Imperial College in central London.

Dr
Theofano Eftaxiopoulou and Dr James Wilgeroth demonstrated the machine 
to the royal and explained to him how scientists put materials in the 
way of the shockwave to analyse its effects.

The force of blasts can cause nerve damage and affect brain function.

Through understanding how shockwaves affect people will enable better protective gear and treatments to be developed.

Harry, a captain in the army who has twice served in Afghanistan, asked how kevlar can protect soldiers against bomb blasts.

Professor James Stirling, the provost of Imperial College London, told him: "We're absolutely focused on that."

Unveiling a plaque at the centre, Harry told guests: 'Today I have had a brief insight into the work of the centre including how injured cells are analysed.

'In the past I have met numerous servicemen and women injured on operations, many by IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and landmines.

'Their stories are harrowing and inspirational.

'Watching the IED simulation has reminded me of the catastrophic trauma experienced by a human body during an IED or mine strike - to me this makes their extraordinary stories of recovery all the more astounding.'

'In addition to our military casualties 
and those civilians injured by acts of terrorism, many thousands more 
people across the world will suffer traumatic, life changing injuries, 
as a result of landmine explosions.'
