If he carries on at this rate it won’t be long before Chelsea captain John Terry has his own Rocky-style training montage.

The 33-year-old, who was the first player back for pre-season training at the Blues’ training ground at Cobham last week, uploaded videos of him being put through his paces by Chelsea staff to his Instagram account.

And now he has been posted a clip of him working on his stamina by running in sand, as he continues his quest to be in the best shape possible come the start of the new season.

Calls for Terry's intergration back into the England set-up were voiced after the Three Lions registered only a point during this summer's showpiece in Brazil.

The centre-back retired from international duty in September 2012 after winning 78 caps, shortly before he was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.

Despite appeals for his reinstatement Terry was omitted from Hodgson's World Cup squad, with the former Liverpool and Fulham boss choosing his club colleague Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four central defenders in the squad.

Mourinho’s side will be looking to challenge on all fronts next time
