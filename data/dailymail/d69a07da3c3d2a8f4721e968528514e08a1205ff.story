A 17st 12lbs dad who was so shocked by a photo of him and his son that he embarked on a weight-loss journey to set a healthier example to his children has won a national slimming award.

David Eyres, from Oldham, didn't recognise the man he saw in the picture, which was taken on Christmas Eve 2013, and he became determined to lose weight.

The self-employed landscape gardener had been overweight for years and things got worse when he turned to food for comfort after the death of his father in 2009.  

David was horrified after realising he could barely recognise himself in this Christmas snap with his son Ben (left), he recreated it a year later having lost weight

The dad-of-three joined his local Slimming World group with his wife Kelly, 35, in January 2014. Now just more than one year on he's four-and-a-half stone lighter and been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek 2015.

The 34-year-old is the slimming club's first ever winner of the competition, which recognises the male slimmer who has undergone the greatest transformation inside and out.

He said: 'I've been overweight for more than a decade, so it's amazing to me to think that anyone would describe me as "sleek".

'My youngest son Max, who's four, loves telling everyone that his daddy doesn't have a big belly anymore though - my kids are my biggest supporters.'

David said his eating habits became such a problem that he would often eat in secret while he was at work.

He tried lots of diets without success before Kelly suggested they join Slimming World together.

David's wife Kelly, left, also joined Slimming World and lost and impressive five stone herself 

David said: 'I would get out of breath easily, even just climbing the stairs in our house, so I didn't really play games or sports with the kids and I worried I was setting a bad example to them.

'I tried to put it to the back of my mind but when I saw the photo of me and my eldest son Ben, who was eight at the time, I knew I needed to do something. 

Name: David Eyres

Age: 34

Height: 6ft/1.83m

Starting weight: 17st 12lbs/250lbs/114kg

Current weight: 13st 5lbs/187lbs/85kg

Weight loss: 4st 7lbs/63lbs/29kg

Starting waist measurement: 38in

Current weight measurement: 30in 

'I was the heaviest I'd ever been and my confidence level was pretty much zero. That photograph was a real wake-up call.'

David said although he was nervous about joining the group he knew it was the right thing to do: 'I was worried about being the only man at Slimming World and thought I'd stick out like a sore thumb, so I was really glad I had Kelly with me on that first night. 

'The Consultant Michaela was so welcoming though and within a couple of weeks my nerves had disappeared. 

'I started to look forward to going to Slimming World each week, of course because I wanted to know how much weight I'd lost but I wanted to see how everyone else had got on too.'

David followed the group's healthy eating plan and quickly began to see the results. In his first week David lost 3.5lbs and within five months he'd reached his first target, losing 4st 1lb. 

He's since lost another 6lbs to reach a total weight loss of 4st 7lbs, going from 17st 12lbs to 13st 5lbs, and dropped 8in from his waist. 

David says: 'I couldn't believe the change in me in just a few months. I'm quite competitive and I loved collecting the awards that you get for every 7lbs you lose. 

'They made me want to keep going for the next milestone and I've got all the certificates stuck to our fridge.'   

Kelly and David have lost an impressive nine and a half stone between them in the last year 

David says that one of the best things about losing weight is that his children are really proud of him 

David said the group helped him to completely overhaul his diet: 'We were always a 'jar family' using pre-prepared sauces and convenience foods and we had a lot of takeaways - sometimes four or five times a week - just because it was easy.

'But we started cooking from scratch and now the whole family eats the same meals. We love homemade curries, they taste just like the takeaways we used to have but obviously they're a lot better for you.'

David's fitness has improved too. He no longer gets out of breath and has more energy: 'Work is a lot easier now and I've joined a gym. 

'Best of all, I can run around with the kids and practice rugby with Ben at the park - I've gone from feeling like a failed parent to feeling like a proud dad.'

Before embarking on his weight loss plan, David would think nothing of wolfing down hearty meals

Kelly has also found success with Slimming World, having lost around 5st. David says: 'I couldn't believe it when I found out I'd won the title of Mr Sleek and Kelly was over the moon for me, especially because she knew she'd get to see me in a suit for the first time in years. 

'We're both so proud of each other - it's amazing to think we've lost nearly 10st between us in a year - and I'm so glad we've done this together.

'I hope my story will show people, especially other men, that losing weight doesn't have to be hard and it really is possible to make your New Year's resolutions come true. 

'This Christmas Eve Ben and I recreated the photo that made me want to start losing weight, I looked like a different bloke - and I feel like one too.'
