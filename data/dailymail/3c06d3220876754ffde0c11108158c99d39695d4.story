A police officer's wife is one of two women arrested in connection with a Florida prostitution 
ring.

Denise McCoy, 34, whose husband is a Boca Raton police officer, was charged along with Sara Marin, 42, in a prostitution and money-laundering scheme.

McCoy owned a business called Sara’s Entertainment Service and the two women were allegedly earning a living through their own sexual activity with men and the 
earnings of at least six of their hired escorts.

According to the affidavit the prostitutes collected $200 per hour plus tips, and split the cash evenly with McCoy and Marin.

The pair were arrested after a Brazilian woman helped police unearth the prostitution ring.

The woman had been caught on immigration charges and told police she had been forced
to work as a prostitute in the Boca Raton area for the past nine 
months, reported the Palm Beach Post.

A police probable-cause affidavit said she had arrived from Brazil in August 2011 and met with a woman 
she knew as only 'Sara.' 

She was allegedly told by Marin - who is also originally from Brazil - that she owned an escort agency.

She was told that she was not required to have sexual intercourse with the 
men she escorted and she started to work with them.

Initially this seemed to be correct as she attended several lunch and dinner dates where there was no sex expected.

But then McCoy allegedly drove her to an apartment in Boca Raton to meet a man who expected sex, reported the Sun Sentinel. 

When the woman  refused and called McCoy, she was threatened that McCoy would have her jailed as an illegal immigrant if she did not comply.

Police say the prostitutes were forced to have sex with as many as twelve men per day at the two apartments in suburban Boca Raton.

After a 5-month investigation, search warrants were executed Tuesday.

They were served at two apartments rented by Sara’s Entertainment that officers suspected were used for prostitution.

Denise McCoy and Marin were jailed later that day on pimping and money laundering charges, and remained in the Palm Beach County Jail without bail late yesterday.

McCoy’s husband of six years, city police officer Samuel McCoy, was not arrested in the investigation and is not a subject of it at this time, said John Vecchio, violent crimes supervisor for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Miami regional center.

McCoy was suspended in 2009, the Sun-Sentinel reported, for looking at pornography on his work computer.

He said he was looking for jujitsu videos online and clicked on other links that interested him.

That same year he was caught taking pictures of his genital area while on duty, but said it was medical reasons.

Boca Police Chief Dan Alexander said Wednesday that Samuel McCoy has been put on paid administrative leave.

'It's very early [in the investigation],' Mr Alexander said to the Sun Sentinel.

The mayor of Boca Raton says no one has indicated that officer McCoy was involved in the alleged prostitution ring, reported WPTV.com.

'The investigation will prove whatever it proves and if he had absolutely nothing to do with this then he's a fine person and he will continue,' said mayor Susan Whelchel.
