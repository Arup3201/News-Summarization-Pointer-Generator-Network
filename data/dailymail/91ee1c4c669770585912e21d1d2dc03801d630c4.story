Children of the 1960s and onwards have marvelled at slides showing everything from 3D scenes of the world to cartoon characters though their View-Master toy.

Now, a retro-style invite issued by Google and toy maker Mattel hints that the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover.

While we can only guess at the result of the collaboration, the product will be unveiled next Friday morning in New York City.

A retro-style invite issued by Google and toy maker Mattel hints that the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover. The design of the invitation, together with the mention of ‘viewing’ seems to show View-Master reels may suggest that a digital version of the toy is in the pipeline

The invitation reads: ‘Mattel invites you to view what's possible with exclusive announcement and product debut’.

The design of the invitation, which seems to show View-Master reels - together with the mention of ‘viewing’ - may suggest that a digital version of the toy is in the pipeline.

Originally conceived in 1938, the View-Master, a handheld device showing 3D slides, was initially aimed at adults, but became a popular toy in the 1960s.

The timing is appropriate too, because two days after the announcement, Toy Fair 2015 begins in Manhattan, The Verge noted.

In 1938, cameraman William Gruber produced 3-D colour slides for stereoscopes - which were popular in 19th century homes – using two cameras strapped together.

An encounter with Harold Graves, president of Sawyer's Photographic Services in the Oregon Caves National Monument led to a partnership a year later.

They came up with the View-Master – a new way of viewing tourist attractions in America – which was sold to adults in camera shops.

It was only in the 1960s that the View-Master became a toy, and afterwards, cheap reels were produced showing scenes across the world, Disneyland and cartoon characters in ‘3D’.

Today, the toy is produced by Fisher Price - part of the Mattel group.

Numerous people taking to Twitter with their guesses have humerously suggested a ‘Glasshole Barbie’ could be revealed next week. 

'Glasshole' was the derogative name given to wearers of Google's now retired smart spectacles. 

There is some speculation that Google may have re-focused its ‘Cardboard’ project for a young audience.

Last summer, the Mountain View-based tech firm revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard, which was given out to attendees of the firm's annual developer conference.

It used a mobile phones as the display, with a special app to show 3D images and video.

Google seems to be intent of winning the hearts and minds of children, having announced this week that it has acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic.

Google has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome, YouTube and search, which are set to be released this year.

You'll also need a ruler, glue, and scissors, an X-acto knife, or access to a laser cutter.
