Jack Lew has apparently ditched his circular signature in favor of something much more befitting of the U.S. treasury secretary.

Lew, who was appointed to the post earlier this year, created a media stir when his autograph - a series of loops that look nothing like his name - was revealed as the one that would grace all American paper money.

But last week, a document from the Financial Stability Oversight Council showed Lew's signature to be legible, with a more pronounced 'J' and 'L.'

Clarity: Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's new signature was revealed in a Financial Stability and Oversight Committee document last week

Loopy: Lew's old signature was just a series of circles that looked nothing like his name

Scrawl: President Obama joked that Jack Lew's loopy signature could devalue the national currency at Lew's nomination in January

The change was first noticed by the Wall Street Journal.

It is not known whether Lew took any handwriting or calligraphy classes in order to improve his signature.

The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to an email from MailOnline for comment.

When he was appointed to the post by Obama in January, even the president took a dig at Lew's scrawl.

Obama joked that it he had considered abandoning Lew's nomination after learning of his illegible signature, and added that it could become an international embarrassment.

He added: 'Jack assures me that he is going to 
work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our 
currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury.'

Money matters? If Lew kept the old signature, it would have looked like this on the dollar bill

Lew
also poked fun at himself, saying that he and his predecessor, Timothy Geithner, have both struggled with signage.

He
said that 'it was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a
common challenge with penmanship.'

Geithner also modified his signature to make it readable on currency.

Lew, 57, was managing director for Citigroup from July 2006 until the end of 2008, when he joined the Obama administration as the president's chief of staff.

Treasury officials told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Lew still has time before providing his official signature for all of the nation's currency, something that he is expected to do later this year.

Common problem: Lew wisecracked that he did not know that he shared a 'common challenge with outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, left, who had a similarly bad signature

Old version: Outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner used to have a signature like the one seen here

Improved: His signature, seen bottom right, showed his full name and was much more legible and controlled
