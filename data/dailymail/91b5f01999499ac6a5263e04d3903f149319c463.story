Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

At times it was like watching a Beat-‘Em-Up arcade game instead of Brazil. They can be a team of bruisers when they need to be.

James Rodriguez was on the carousel in Fortaleza last night, kicked to death as Brazil’s players took it in turns to nobble him.

Colombia’s No10 was the danger-man, the World Cup’s leading goalscorer after hitting the target five times on their journey to the quarter-finals. Brazil did a number on him.

Hit: Rodriguez was Colombia's danger-man but could do little to get past a brutal Brazilian defence

Chase: Brazil were on the hunt for Rodriguez and often made sure they got their man

31 - Fouls committed by Brazil

5 - by Marcelo

4 - by Fernandinho, Hulk and Fred

3 - by Paulinho

23 - Fouls committed by Colombia

6 - Rodriguez and Cuadrado were fouled six times each during the 2-1 defeat

54 - Most fouls of 2014 World Cup

51 - Previous most (Brazil vs Chile)

Fernandinho did him first, somehow escaping a yellow card from Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo in the opening minutes.

After that, this bruising World Cup quarter-final was a free-for-all.

There were 54 fouls in all and that’s plain daft at this level. In fact, that's the most fouls committed than in any match at this tournament so far.

The previous most was 51 from Brazil vs Chile.

By the finish, when Colombia substitute Juan Quintero just bundled over Oscar by the touchline, Carballo had completely lost control of the match.

Colombia got their revenge of sorts when Neymar was stretcher off in the final minutes of this incredible quarter-final tie in Fortaleza.

Set aside the brilliance of his delivery for Thiago Silva’s seventh minute strike and David Luiz’s belting free-kick, this game belonged to another era.

Our emotional attachment to the 1970 Brazil team, when Tostao, Pele, Jairzinho and Rivellino ruled the world, will not be eclipsed by this team.

Instead they can be remembered for this wild night in the Estadio Castelao for bullying their way past Colombia and a referee who let them get away with it.

To think that Carballo is one of the best referees in Europe and yet he let Brazil get away with ambush tactics on Rodriguez, Juan Cuadrado and Victor Ibarbo. All three were smashed to bits.

Short of grabbing Rodriguez by his testicles, Brazil’s players went through the card when it came to finding ways to stop the Colombia forward. At least he got a goal, his sixth of the tournament.

Fernandinho’s challenge was ‘a reducer’ as Ron Atkinson used to love calling the first, brutal tackle of any match.

Paulinho, David Luiz, Marcelo and Brazil’s captain Thiago Silva all had a crack at him after that.

The poor kid isn’t streetwise enough just yet to shake them off and he knew that every time he took a touch then someone in one of those yellow shirts was about to snap him in half.

By the time he headed for the tunnel at the break, he had been fouled four times. Cuadrao (three) and Ibarbo (three) were not far behind.

Until Rodriguez slipped the ball through for Carlos Baccos to earn Colombia a penalty, he was a passenger in this passionate arena.

6 - James Rodriguez (Colombia)

4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil)

3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italic are out of the World Cup.

He scored from the spot, his sixth goal of this incredible tournament, but it felt like it was too late to change the direction of the game.

We are watching a 21st century Brazil at this World Cup, a team who can play a bit and kick a bit. It’s not always easy to watch.

When Neymar is on the ball, teasing his way through opposition defences with those mesmerising runs, they are still a joy.

Then there is the nasty side, the predatory attacks when defenders jump out of darkened alleys and take out the main men.

This is the way they have to play, particularly with so many of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s key personnel playing their football at the highest level in Europe.

David Luiz, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, Maicon, Paulinho, Fernandinho, Neymar, Oscar and Hulk have all played Champions League football.

It feels barbaric at times and yet they have found a way to out-muscle their opponents.

When the going gets rough, Brazil get going.
