Two managers have been suspended after a hospital trust admitted discharging hundreds of suspected cancer patients by mistake.

West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said at least one person might have died as a result of the errors and 121 patients are yet to have their cases reviewed.

A £40,000 external investigation is under way at the trust, which is made up of Hemel Hempstead Hospital, Watford General Hospital and St Albans City Hospital.

An independent investigation into the blunders at the Trust has revealed a GP warned there could be a major problem in November 2012 - a full year before the Trust launched its investigation

In one case where a patient died, the trust said it was thought a delay in seeing them might have contributed to their death.

It is now in the process of contacting the family of a second patient who has since died. That patient had advanced cancer at the stage the initial referral was made.

In another case, a patient had their diagnosis delayed due to errors but their cancer was found at the earliest stage.

Overall, 810 people have had their cases reviewed. Of these, 686 have been told there are no clinical concerns about the care they received.

The mistakes came to light in 
November when Samantha Jones, who took over from Mr Filochowski as chief
 executive last February, asked for a review of the system for booking 
cancer appointments.

A review by the trust, which runs 
Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead hospitals, found that 686 people 
were not harmed by the delays.

It is investigating other 121 cases and speaking to doctors and relatives.

None turned up for their initial examinations however, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters.

Given the urgency of their cases, staff should have contacted them immediately to arrange another slot.

Instead, it is thought they were removed from the computer system with no further action taken.

The blunders made some patients wait several weeks for diagnosis – with fatal results in two cases.

Patients who missed their first appointment and were recorded as not showing up were discharged by the hospital. NHS rules say patients should always be offered a second appointment.

The patients had been referred for urgent appointments by doctors between January 2010 and November 2013.

The trust announced today that a £40,000 external review is being carried out by four authorities, including NHS England and the Trust Development Authority.

It said it had offered patients 'our apologies for any anxiety and distress' caused by the events and had implemented a new IT system to track each patient’s appointment, missed appointments and cancellations.

Trust chief executive Samantha Jones said: 'It is absolutely clear that the trust was not always following the correct administrative processes for these patients and we let them down.

'These concerns date back a number of years and were identified as part of the new management team’s commitment to improve the way we administer and manage patient care.

'I would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected and particularly to the relatives of those who have since died.

'We have of course made significant changes to help prevent this ever happening again and will share the outcome of our investigations with those affected and with the wider public.'

The trust said it is 'confident' it has contacted everyone affected 
by the errors but anyone concerned should contact their GP or call the 
trust’s information line on 01923 217100.

Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said today the errors were 'very worrying and clearly unacceptable'.

He said: 'What has happened at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust is very worrying and clearly unacceptable.

'Every patient in the NHS expects and deserves the very best care to give them the highest possible chance of surviving cancer.

'An independent review has been set up to investigate the issue urgently, and the Care Quality Commission will be monitoring the situation closely on the ground.

'The new and independent chief inspector of hospitals will be looking at the quality of care for patients - including cancer care - in his ongoing programme of inspections.

'This Government is also making the deliberate falsification of hospital records a criminal offence as part of our new emphasis on transparency and openness in the NHS.'

It also emerged last night that the man
 who was in charge at the time quit the Health Service just as the 
problems were coming to light.

Jan
 Filochowski, who had moved on to Great Ormond Street, suddenly left the
 London hospital in December, saying he wanted to pursue ‘other 
opportunities’.

He takes 
with him a £3million taxpayer-funded pension pot. The mistakes affected 
810 patients urgently referred to the West Hertfordshire trust for tests
 between 2010 and 2013 because their GP feared they had cancer.

A few weeks later, Mr Filochowski,
 62, announced he was going to retire just a year into his Great Ormond 
Street posting. The married father of two gave up a £280,000 annual 
salary, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books.

He
 was handed a retirement lump sum payment of £412,000 on top of his 
£140,000-a-year pension – one of the most generous in the public sector.

Speaking from his £1.3million home in 
Islington, North London, last night Mr Filochowski said: ‘I’m not 
prepared to comment having no knowledge about the issues and it being 
some time since I left the trust. I will try to find something out about
 this.'

Anyone concerned should contact their GP or call the 
trust’s information line on 01923 217100.
