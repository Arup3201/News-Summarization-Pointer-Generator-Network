A police car for the smartphone generation, bristling with gadgetry to beat crime, is about to be unveiled on Britain’s streets.

The high-tech ‘Robocop’ car uses face-recognition cameras to identify known criminals, while onboard computers locate crime hotspots. 

The British-built Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer may look like an ordinary police car but inside it boasts a range of cyber weapons capable of tracking down suspects and beaming evidence back to base.

The next generation: The new police car has a variety of gadgets to make crime fighting more efficient

Police car: The Robocop car is the latest in the development of the police vehicle and will make officers more able to predict accurately where crimes will happen

The £12,000 of state-of-the-art gadgetry, including three computers and six cameras, means the car can predict where crimes may happen and send the officers to the scene before any offence takes place.

The vehicle has won backing from the Association of Chief Police Officers, which set its manufacturers the challenge of designing and building a police car for the future.

High-definition cameras allow the Astra to capture every movement surrounding it, recording activity on the streets and scanning people’s faces using facial-recognition software.

The car has been compared to futuristic police officer Robocop from the eighties movie of the same name

The car, which costs £21,020 and has a 122mph top speed, is also equipped with fast broadband internet so that officers can upload images and access CCTV footage and photos from the police national database, allowing up-to-the-second intelligence-sharing.

A screen on the dashboard, which looks like a satnav, displays a stream of information about people and places outside.

Vauxhall, which has a 70 per cent share of the police fleet market, claims the broadband bubble around the vehicle means officers can spend an extra two hours out in the field. After successfully completing its tests earlier this year, the Tourer is now being considered by forces all over the country. 

The car’s maker says it is an answer to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe’s directives for the car to be the mobile office, so officers are always out in the field.

The Tourer allows for the docking of rugged ‘Toughbook’ laptops and smartphones in the glove compartment and has an aircraft-style black box behind a floor panel in the boot which continuously collects data.

Mounted on the front, rear and both sides of the roof are tiny cameras that can spot potential crime scenes as the car is moving. The cameras also provide automatic number-plate recognition, which flags up any vehicles linked to crimes. 

Two more cameras are fixed on the officers and the back seat so there is a visual record of a suspect’s evidence which can also be used to provide evidence in claims of police brutality.

Dick Ellam, Vauxhall’s special vehicles manager, said: ‘This British-built and converted Astra will help make police officers more efficient. It allows them to spend more time fighting crime.’
