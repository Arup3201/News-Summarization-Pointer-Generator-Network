Mr Justice Moylan (pictured), sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in London, said his 'paramount consideration' was the girl's welfare

A couple have been given the go-ahead to adopt a three-year-old girl despite separating during the adoption process.

The couple, who are in their 40s and were married for several years before separating, have been allowed to complete the adoption of the young girl after a court heard how she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed them both as her 'parents'.

The youngster had been placed in the care of a local authority when she was born, Mr Justice Moylan heard during a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Her father had died and she last had contact with her mother when she was five months old.

She had been placed with foster carers and had then moved in with the couple who were aiming to adopt her. The couple had notified a local authority that they were going to separate shortly after making an adoption application.

Since their separation last year, the couple have been living apart and the child has lived with the woman - her prospective adoptive mother.

Mr Justice Moylan said he had considered ordering the woman to restart the process and make a fresh application to adopt the girl herself.

But the judge said both the man and the woman wanted to adopt the girl jointly.

He said he had decided that it was in the girl's best interests for them to be allowed to adopt - even though they were no longer together.

He said he had heard evidence from the man and woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and from a social worker.

He said it was clear that both the man and the woman were committed to the youngster, that she had developed a strong bond with them and viewed both as her 'parents' and that they had managed to maintain good relations between themselves.

'My paramount consideration is [the girl's] welfare throughout her life,' said Mr Justice Moylan.

The couple, who are both in their 40s and were married for several years before splitting, have been allowed to adopt the young girl after the High Court in London heard how she already viewed them both as her 'parents'

'There are a number of factors which lead me to conclude that in order to secure and promote welfare throughout her life, it is necessary for her position within this family itself to be secured by an order which makes both her parents.'

The judge said the man was in 'practical, psychological terms' the girl's 'father' and she was his 'daughter'. In the same way, the woman was the girl's 'mother'.

He added: 'Although the parties are separated, they have continued to co-parent by agreement and, importantly, without significant disagreement or dispute.

'The factors in this case weigh decisively in favour of my making a joint adoption order in favour of the couple.'
