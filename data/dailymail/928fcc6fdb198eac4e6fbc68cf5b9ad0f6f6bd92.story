Four tiny
puppies who were dumped behind a Lidl store inside a battered old shoebox in freezing conditions just days before Christmas have all found happy endings in loving families in time for Valentine's Day.

Snow White, Cinderella, Prince Charming and Buttons, so named because they were born around pantomime season, have each been successfully rehomed by doting staff at Dogs Trust Canterbury.

They have all been adopted by local families, and each will be keeping his or her original name.

The little scamps were named after pantomime characters since they were discovered during the Christmas season - and their new owners plan to keep their original names

The adorable cross-breed pups have been lovingly hand-reared by staff at Dogs Trust ever since they were found in December by a member of public when they were just five days old.

But now Prince Charming will be going home with Rochelle Haywood, 24, from Whitstable; Hayley Gore will be taking Cinderella; Snow White is heading off with Becky, Bethany, Owen and Mark Whittaker; and Peter and Julie Cant are welcoming Buttons into their family.

As reported in MailOnline on Boxing Day, Dog Trust staff including Lara Murphy and Ruth Howard took it in turns to take the puppies home and look after them, feeding them around the clock until they were old enough to leave for homes of their own.

It is
likely to have been bred by an unscrupulous breeder as presents for the
Christmas market.

The Christmas pantomime puppies have all been successfully rehomed in time for Valentine's Day

The four puppies, found in an old slipper box behind a Lidl in Canterbury, Kent, were named Prince Charming, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Buttons, after pantomime characters

'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them'

Fortunately they were rescued in time, and staff have
devoted the last six weeks to ensuring that they were given the best possible
care to survive without their mother.

Dogs Trust
Canterbury Rehoming Centre Manager, Adam Levy, said: 'It was touch-and-go with the puppies when they first came to us.

'They were so young and
their immune systems were not developed, so we had a real challenge keeping them
alive.

'We took it in
turns taking them home and bottle-feeding them each hour throughout the night.

'It's so
fantastic to see that all our hard work has paid-off and we have been able to
watch them grow into such happy, healthy, fun-loving little dogs.

'We have
become so attached to this adorable foursome over the last few months and we
will really miss them, but we know that this is the perfect outcome for these
pups who were at death's door just before Christmas, and will now be looking
forward to spending Valentine's day and the rest of their lives as much-loved
family members in happy homes.'

Prince
Charming's new owner, Rochelle Haywood, said: 'We were
shocked when we heard little Prince Charming's ordeal.

'We are so glad that he
and his brother and sisters all survived thanks to the dedication of the staff
at Dogs Trust Canterbury, and that we are now able to give him the loving home
he deserves after all he has been through.

'We absolutely adore him and he is
really enjoying making himself at home. We have only had him a couple of days
but he fits in so well you would think he had been part of the family for years - we certainly couldn't do without him and are delighted to be part of Prince
Charming's furry-tail ending.'

'A dog is for life, 
not just for Christmas' is the saying coined by the Dogs Trust 35 years 
ago to stop people buying puppies on a whim during the festive season, 
only to give them up halfway through the new year when they realised 
they couldn't handle the responsibility.

Luckily, the Christmas puppies were found just in time, and immediately taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by 
the charity.

Dogs
 Trust Canterbury Rehoming Centre manager, Adam Levy, said at the time: 'It really 
is a  bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so 
callously dumped in  the cold at such a young age.

'We think the puppies were one or two 
days old  when they were dumped. They have been in our care for a week 
now and their eyes  still aren't open.

'They
 were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely 
 nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder 
who has  failed to sell them.

'Our
 centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year,
  but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these 
helpless  puppies without a care if they lived or died.

'They
 will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks. This takes a lot 
of  care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the 
staff.'

'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future'

Mr 
Levy said: 'Their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they 
have  settled down now and are becoming used to human contact. It is 
always touch and  go with pups at this age but they're all feeding well.

'The biggest problem 
is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to  deal with other
 dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother  figure 
in the future.

'It's 
hard to tell what breed they are. They have brown patches which look 
like  they could be part Jack Russell but they also look quite Staffy. 
What we do  know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably 
become clearer as they  grow.'

Dogs 
Trust CEO, Clarissa Baldwin, said: 'This year sees the 35th anniversary 
of  Dogs Trust's iconic slogan "A dog is for life, not just for 
Christmas", and  sadly it's as true today as when it was first coined.

'Every
 year we see a  number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the 
days and weeks around  Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has 
worn off.

'It seems 
that people are still giving puppies as Christmas presents without  
considering the long term ramifications.

'Dogs can provide a world of 
happiness  and enjoyment, and we urge anyone considering a new addition 
to the family to  think it through properly and care for the dogs for 
its' entire life.'

The puppies were found around the back of the supermarket in a battered old shoe box by a member of the public

Dogs Trust cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for
 a  variety of reasons, including those that have become unwanted gifts.

Staff work 
around the clock looking after the 1,500 dogs that are  based in their 
18 rehoming centres across the UK and one in Dublin.
