The Kate effect has struck for maternity brand Séraphine whose sales have soared by 40 per cent since it was revealed the Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of their designs.

After donning one of their dresses on her first Royal outing since the birth of Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge, the British label saw sales rocket further.

New mother Kate was photographed arriving at her parents’ home in Bucklebury wearing the £50 Blossom Knot Front Lavender Dress on Wednesday.

Just a glimpse: Whilst the world only caught a glimpse of Kate's Seraphine dress on her first outing since the birth of baby George, it went on to sell out

Trendsetter: Recent images of Kate wearing the Renata dress and Blossom dress (pictured) resulted in a sales increase of over 100per cent for the month of July

Demand for the dress has been so high that the site has now stated that orders will not be shipped for at least another month.

This isn't the first time that Kate has worked her magic on Séraphine's sales.

Sales of one item, the £39 Brooke 
dress, quadrupled after the Duchess was reported to have taken a fancy 
to it when she was shopping in Sloane Square, according to founder Cecile Reinaud.

Total
 sales are up 40 per cent since March, when Kate was linked with the 
brand.

Kate
 has
 been a fan of Séraphine throughout her pregnancy, ordering over a 
dozen designs from the brand; who have two West London boutiques, one of
 which is conveniently located on Kensington Church Street, near 
Kensington Palace.

The firm has four London outlets and sells through the internet to more than 30 countries.

Reinaud said: ‘The Kate effect is worldwide. From China, Russia to South Africa, sales are boosted  due to the fact she chose our brand to dress her royal bump.’

Séraphine reported a turnover of £5.2 million in the year ending March 2013 and 
Reinaud expects turnover for 2014 to reach £8 million.

Séraphine prides itself on offering unrivalled wardrobe solutions for pregnant women, 
available in their London boutiques and at selected Peter Jones and John Lewis stores, and online through their international websites.

Created by Cecile Reinaud, Séraphine’s collections hope to exude effortless Parisian chic, and have earned the brand an A-list following 
including Angelina Jolie, January Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner and Kate Hudson.
