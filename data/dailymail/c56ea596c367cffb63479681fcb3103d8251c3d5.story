A professor was beaten to within an inch of his life because four Polish robbers knocked on the wrong door.

The four men were so high on drugs that they continued their onslaught despite coming face to face with a middle-aged white man rather than a black robber in his twenties.

The ruthless crime gang were searching for an underground rival suspected of amassing huge debts who lived next door to the innocent Cambridge graduate.

But unknown to them, burly Kieron Rowe, 26, had been arrested by police just days earlier over a series of armed street robberies. 

As the Polish gang were jailed for a combined total of 64 years yesterday, police sources confirmed that mistaken identity was the most likely explanation behind the attack. 

Paul Kohler, 54, the victim of the horrific attack which left him disfigured and requiring a blood transfusion, said he was 'certain' that mistaken identity had been at the source of the burglary.

The picture of his battered and bloodied face taken after the attack was a pertinent reminder of the beating the father-of-four endured.

Mr Kohler said that his suspicions of mistaken identity had been confirmed by police who gave him information 'in confidence'.

A judge ruled yesterday that all four men had binged on drink and drugs before bursting into the £2million home where Mr Kohler had been playing board games with his family.

A court previously heard that the men were regular substance users and that a stash of drugs had been found in the car driven to the address. 

Mr Kohler, a friend of Prince Edward, was attacked by the thugs when he opened the door to his home in Wimbledon on August 11 2014. 

The four men, now identified as Marius Tomaszewski, 32, Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, Dawid Tychon, 29 and Pawel Honc, 24, burst into the house and began their attack. 

Their faces were masked and they wore blue latex gloves. 

Two members of the group viciously beat Mr Kohler while the others set about finding valuables in the house. 

Yesterday a court heard that while Mr Kohler was being pummelled, one of the gang shouted the words: 'Where's the money?' 

His wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, was blindfolded and held down while she could hear her husband screaming downstairs. 

Yesterday, Judge Susan Tapping, sentencing at Kingston Crown Court, described the attack, which lasted around eight minutes as 'savage'. 

Judge Tapping branded the pictures of Mr Kohler's face 'appalling'. 

She said that the men would have continued their 'unrelenting' beating had police not interrupted them.

Judge Tapping said: 'The violence was increasing and showed no sign of stopping.' 

Speaking to the court on Thursday, prosecutor Charles Evans said that Mr Kohler believed the man who forced him to the ground and beat him had 'enjoyed' it. 

A police source confirmed that the men may have come to Mr Kohler's house because they were looking for Rowe, who lived in social housing next door in a large property divided into flats in King's Road in Wimbledon. 

Rowe, who police confirmed was a notorious criminal in the area, was arrested 13 days before the ambush. 

Despite his anger at the men who viciously beat him in his own home, Mr Kohler said he 'took no pleasure' from seeing them jailed.

He said: 'I feel vindicated by the sentence but I don't want to be vindictive about it.

'I take no pleasure in their deservedly long sentence - and it is a long sentence, and that's right and proper.

'It will be difficult for them, as it should be, but I'm not going to sit here and jump up and down looking delighted about it.

'I still feel some anger, I hope I don't feel bitter. I hope in time that will pass.

'It depends what they do with their lives after this sentence whether or not my anger eventually subsides. 

'I've been told something by the police in confidence which confirms my view they got the wrong address. I'm sure that's what it was, I've always thought that and now I'm pretty convinced that was so.' 

He was jailed for eight years in January after violently robbing two women in the street. 

His police mugshot shows him wearing a t-shirt with words Walter White - a reference to a professor who makes money by manufacturing drugs in television series Breaking Bad. 

During the heist, Rowe pointed a gun at a woman's head as she was walking down the street alone.

He then threatened to shoot if she did not hand over her bag. 

Another detective in Mr Kohler's case dismissed Rowe's link to the investigation saying that the information did not 'add up' and labelled him a 'two bob burglar' who had long been known to police. 

The police source also said that when questioned, Oskar Pawlowicz, one of the four men who stormed the house, said that Mr Kohler's home was just one of three possible addresses they had thought of robbing that night. 

Judge Susan Tapping yesterday accepted that the men may have planned to collect a debt but had gone to the wrong house. 

She said: 'Their house was deliberately targeted, either in expectation that items of significant value were inside or the wrong address was identified where a debt was to be collected. 

'When the doorbell rang and Mr Kohler opened it the violence exploded immediately.' 

After the four men were sent down to face lengthy sentences behind bars yesterday, the Kohler family huddled together and hugged as the six-month ordeal finally drew to a close. 

Eloise Kohler, 25, who had effectively saved her parents' lives by calling the police as she hid in her bedroom sobbed as the sentencing drew to a close. 

Speaking after the men were jailed yesterday, Mr Kohler said: 'I feel vindicated but I am not going to be vindictive. 'I am not going to gloat about the deservedly long sentences.' 

Weapon: A flamethrower was found in the back of Tychon's car on the night he was arrested

On Thursday, Mr Kohler had directed a plea directly to his attackers, asking them to reveal why his family had been targeted. 

He said that, by understanding their motives, he hoped to forgive them. 

But the men failed to answer the question put to them in court on Thursday. 

All four men stared ahead, their faces void of emotion as they heard their fate yesterday. 

Mr Kohler said he still did not believe the men were sorry.

'I didn't see any remorse today. I hope it's something that will come,' he said. 

He admitted that facing up to the men in court had been a 'scary' experience. 

Focussing on life after the ordeal he added: 'The family is strong. We have already moved on and we are stronger for it.' 

Pawel Honc, of no fixed address, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, of Crusoe Road, Mitcham, south London, were both sentenced at Kingston Crown Court to 19 years after admitting grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. 

Oskar Pawlowicz, of Pitcairn Road in Mitcham, and Dawid Tychon, 29, of no fixed address, were both sentenced to 13 years after they pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary. 

Judge Tapping yesterday said that all three men would serve at least two thirds of their sentences. 

Tychon will be deported to Poland after his sentence to face jail for a separate crime there.

It was previously revealed that all the men in the case, apart from Honc, had committed crimes in Poland before moving to Britain.

Between them, the three men had more than 30 convictions. 

Mr Kohler said he would still angry with the burglars for the attack, but would not be celebrating them being jailed
