Thorgan Hazard has revealed it remains his ambition to return to Chelsea, despite only leaving the club on a permanent basis in February.

The 21-year-old younger brother of Eden joined Borussia Monchengladbach on loan last summer and made the deal with the Bundesliga club permanent just last month.

Hazard moved to Chelsea from Lens in 2012 and spent  two seasons on loan at Belgian club Zulte Waregem before moving to Germany.

The youngster is still highly-rated at Chelsea, who have retained a but-back option as part of the transfer, and Hazard has revealed he dreams of returning to the Premier League leaders in the future. 

'Now I've signed here I'm only focused on Monchengladbach. After this, playing at Chelsea remains a goal,' he told Le Figaro. 'I hope that, in a few years, I can return and play there.

'First, I want to have a big season in a major league. I've not done that yet. I hope that, in a few years, I can have accomplished that. But for now, I'm only focused on Monchengladbach.

'If, one day, I want to play at Chelsea again I better play well. But first, I need to help the team achieve our goals.'
