Benefit reforms are ‘morally right’ David Cameron declared last night as he dismissed the complaints of Britain’s leading Catholic about welfare cuts as ‘deeply’ wrong.

The Prime Minister said it is ‘simply not true’ to claim, as Archbishop Vincent Nichols has, that cuts have removed the traditional safety net for benefits claimants.

Mr Cameron said the Government’s reforms are giving claimants ‘new hope and responsibility’ and insisted it was ‘right both economically – and morally – to change’ Labour’s bloated system of state handouts.

David Cameron hit back at criticism from Archbishop Vincent Nichols about the government's welfare reforms

The Prime Minister argued that encouraging people to work, rather than rely on welfare, is a ‘social and moral mission in politics today’.

Allies of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith went further, labelling the leader of Catholics in England and Wales ‘ill-informed’ and ‘out of touch’ for denouncing changes designed to make work pay.

Another official branded Archbishop Nichols ‘barmy’ after he renewed his attack on the Coalition yesterday.

The Most Rev Vincent Nichols complained last week that the ‘safety net’ has been removed as a result of the Coalition’s welfare savings.

Yesterday, in an interview with Radio 4’s Today Programme, Archbishop Nichols said: ‘There are many cases where people are left without benefits.

‘The voices that I hear express anger and despair.  Something is going seriously wrong when, in a country as affluent as ours, there are people left in that destitute situation and depend solely on the hand-outs of the charity of food banks.’

Archbishop Nichols rejected claims that Mr Duncan Smith’s reforms – which include capping the amount families can claim at £26,000 a year – have a ‘moral purpose’.

He said: ‘For some it is certainly not working out that way.’

The Archbishop then quoted the case of a man on Jobseeker’s Allowance. ‘It’s quite heart-breaking the way that some of the people are treated, expected to apply for six jobs per week online in order to keep their benefits,’ he said.

A senior Government source branded the prelate ‘barmy’ for complaining about the new requirements for Jobseekers Allowance. ‘The clue is in the title. It’s Jobseeker’s allowance.’

In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron defended Archbishop Nichols’ right to denounce government policy since ‘many of the great political questions of our time are also moral questions ‘.

But he added: ‘I respect his view but I also disagree with it deeply.’

Mr Cameron pointed out that Jobseeker’s Allowance has gone up by £6.25 a week since the election. He wrote: ‘Let’s get the facts straight. Archbishop Nichols’ claims that the basic safety net no longer exists are simply not true.

‘Our long-term economic plan for Britain is not just about doing what we can afford, it is also about doing what is right.

‘For me the moral case for welfare reform is every bit as important as making the numbers add up: building a country where people aren’t trapped in a cycle of dependency.

‘Our welfare reforms are about giving new purpose, new opportunity, new hope - and yes, new responsibility to people who had previously been written off.’

The Prime Minister said Labour’s welfare system paid people ‘astonishing sums’ in Housing benefit and left thousands ‘forgotten about’ on Incapacity Benefit.

‘None of these things is defensible. And it is right both economically – and morally – to change them.

‘Whatever your religious or spiritual perspective, I believe very firmly that it is wrong to penalise those who work hard and do the right thing while rewarding those who can work but don’t.’

He concludes: ‘Seeing these reforms through is at the heart of our long-term economic plan – and it is at the heart too of our social and moral mission in politics today.’

A source close to Mr Duncan Smith, said: ‘The Archbishop is entitled to his own opinion, but his comments appear remarkably ill informed.

‘For a start to say that the ‘safety net’ of the welfare state has been eroded when we are currently spending £200bn on benefits every year it seems incredibly out of touch.’

The source added: ‘I would think that as a churchman the Archbishop would be supportive of the work Iain’s doing - transforming the bloated and broken welfare system we inherited from the last government - and reforming it in order to improve peoples’ life chances.
