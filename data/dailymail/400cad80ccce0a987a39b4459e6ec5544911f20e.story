The worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed more than 4,400 lives, with the vast majority of the victims living in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

More than half the dead have been in Liberia, where the healthcare system is still reeling from a devastating 1989-2003 civil war.

Healthcare unions in Liberia called off a strike today over pay and working conditions for medical staff tackling the epidemic.

The strike, which began on Monday, garnered poor support and most hospitals and clinics in the West African country had been operating normally.

'We have called for the strike action to be called off on humanitarian grounds,' said George Williams, secretary-general of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia.

'Our doors are open for negotiations at a later date...but as of now we call off the action based on numerous appeals from the Liberian people both home and the diaspora.'

The deadly virus has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far.

The virus, which claims a death rate of 70 per cent, has torn apart families in the West African city of Monrovia

The World Health Organization (WHO)  said yesterday that the epidemic was continuing to spread in the three worst-hit nations and there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases a week by early December. 

WHO assistant director-general Dr. Bruce Aylward said that the 70 per cent death rate of Ebola was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance. Previously, WHO had said the death rate was around 50 per cent. 

He said the U.N. health agency was still focused on trying to treat Ebola patients, despite the huge demands on the broken health systems in West Africa.

'It would be horrifically unethical to say that we're just going to isolate people,' he said, noting that new strategies like handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics - without much treatment - was a priority.
