Billions were wiped off the value of Scottish companies yesterday: Lloyds lost £1.1billion of its market value in the space of a day

The pound slumped and billions were wiped off the value of Scottish companies yesterday as markets reacted to the growing risk posed by independence.

Sterling slipped to a ten-month low against the dollar and also fell against the euro.

It led to warnings from currency traders that the pound could continue to fall even beyond the referendum, making holidays more expensive for visitors to the US and Europe and inflating the cost of imports.

Concern about the potential end of the Union also sparked a sale of shares in FTSE firms based in Scotland or with strong ties there, resulting in a combined £2.5billion fall in their value.

Banks, which have warned that independence could have a significant impact on their future, were worst hit.

Lloyds lost £1.1billion of its market value in the space of a day, amid fears that Scottish independence could add to its costs. It is considering moving its registered office from Edinburgh to London in the event of a victory for nationalists, it emerged last week.

Shares in TSB, which is owned by Lloyds and does a quarter of its mortgage lending north of the border, also fell. And Royal Bank of Scotland, still 79 per cent owned by the British taxpayer, saw £284million wiped off its share value by the end of the day.

It also emerged that some businesses and consumers in Scotland have started moving bank deposits to England.

WedoScotland, a support organisation for 164 business owners, said: ‘Some of our members have moved their bank accounts to England. Some are looking at registering their businesses in England if independence goes through.’

The slump in the shares of RBS and Lloyds and the complications of moving corporate offices from Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively in the case of a ‘yes’ vote will almost certainly mean UK taxpayers will have to wait even longer to see the return of the billions pumped into the failed banks. 

Among high-profile victims of the fall in value of Scottish firms yesterday were power supplier SSE and defence company BAE Systems.

Other companies likely to be most affected by a Yes vote include Diageo, the dominant Scotch whisky distiller.

It is one of Britain’s biggest exporters but has no choice but to remain in Scotland. It would need to renegotiate trade agreements with its customers overseas as well as new arrangements for the collection of excise duties.

British companies with relatively few Scottish ties performed better in the markets, triggering warnings that Scotland would be harder hit than the rest of the UK by independence.

Professor Roy Batchelor of the Cass Business School in London: ‘The risks to the UK are trivial compared to those triggered in Scotland by the likely flight of capital and business talent if the Yes campaign wins.’

The Scottish share sell-off comes just a fortnight after 130 business leaders signed a letter warning of the consequences of independence.

Economists have warned that a Yes vote would trigger a protracted period of political negotiations that would weigh on Britain’s attractiveness to investors. And they say Scotland would be forced to lean far too heavily on the unpredictable income from North Sea oil and gas.

Managers of global investment funds at Fidelity Worldwide Investment predicted that there would be a ‘strong bounce in sterling’ if there were to be a ‘no’ vote. In the case of a ‘yes’ vote ‘things would get messier’.
