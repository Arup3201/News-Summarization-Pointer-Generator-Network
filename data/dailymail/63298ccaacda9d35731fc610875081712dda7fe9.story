Those feeling a bit woolly as they emerged on Sunday morning in Madrid may have got a shock to see a flock of 2,000 sheep parading through the city's streets.

The muster is part of a 700-year-old law that allows farmers to move their livestock through areas that were open pastures and woodland before modern day Madrid became a sprawling city.

With the tradition under threat due to modern farming practices, shepherds continue to lead their sheep through the streets to defend their ancient grazing, droving and migration rights.

While a serious statement about their livelihoods, the muster is quite a spectacle for locals and tourists as traffic is blocked to allow the safe passage of the flock.

The walk moved through some of the city's most recognisable features, and paused at the old town hall so the chief herdsman could hand authorities their fee for the crossing - they pay 25 maravedies, Iberian copper coins first minted in the 11th century.

The shepherds led their sheep by the Puerta del Sol (Madrid's Piccadilly Circus or Times Square equivalent) and past the Bank of Spain's main office as they headed to Retiro Park.

In medieval times, Madrid was a landscape ripe with grazing land and woodland - some of the grazing routes date back to 1372 but have been blocked since King Philip II selected the site to be the capital of his empire in 1561.

Musicians and dancers in regional rural costumes accompanied the parade and showed the pride the Spanish take in their native Merino breed of sheep, originally from the historic Castile region of Spain and also Turkey. Now the breed is hugely important to the wool industries of South America and Australia.
