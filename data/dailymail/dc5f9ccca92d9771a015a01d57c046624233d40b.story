A young elephant got thoroughly punished for his bad behaviour when he was forced to stay out in the rain while the rest of the heard sheltered under a tree.

The male calf can be seen starring forlornly into the distance as thunderstorm and rain fall on the savanna. 

The family quarrel, preceded by what appears to be a 'trunk war' took place in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, 

Naughty step: A young bull elephant is made to stay out in the rain - possibly for his bad behaviour - while his family huddle under an acacia tree

The herd of elephants was captured by Kelvin Zhang, a scientist from Los Angeles, California, who was visiting the Serengeti.

Mr Zhang, 37, said he spotted the elephants underneath the acacia tree as he was also seeking shelter from the oncoming storm.  

He said: 'I wasn't sure if these elephants were there to hide from the rain or not because I thought thick skinned animals like elephants do not usually care much about the rain.

'Not until we got very close to the tree did I realise there was this little elephant calf standing alone in the rain, with all others under the tree.'

'I was rather intrigued by the fact he was standing away from the tree alone, where all his companions congregate,  in my understanding deliberately as he had his face away from the rest of the group.

'It was a very interesting moment because it reflects some peculiar behaviour about these animals.

'They are highly social most of the time but like us they can have a temper or small fights.

'The calves can have their rebellious moments, and like us, they may sometimes prefer some alone time.'
