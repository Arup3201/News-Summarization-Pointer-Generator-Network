A baby boy died after doctors repeatedly failed to diagnose a life-threatening heart condition, an inquest has heard.

Thomas Duffy was 14-months-old when he died after going into cardiac arrest at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire in March 2011.

A coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure' after they failed to recognise the symptoms of the condition when his parents, Jo and John Duffy, took him into the A&E department as he struggled to breathe. 

Speaking today, Mr and Mrs Duffy today said that they have finally received justice, following a three-year battle to find out the truth surrounding their infant son's death.

The hospital trust responsible has since apologised for the poor standard of care Thomas received. 

Thomas Duffy died from a cardiac arrest at just 14 months old after doctors repeatedly failed to diagnose an underlying heart condition

Parents Jo and John Duffy, 36 and 39, (pictured with their son Luke) underwent three inquests to battle for a fair and accurate public account of what happened to their son. At the latest inquest, a coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure'

An inquest held in June 2011, three months after Thomas' death, found that he died of natural causes.

But his parents fought successfully to have the ruling overturned, concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence during the proceedings 

A second inquest was held in December last year, but it had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence. 

Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hope that their case will encourage changes to ensure other parents do not suffer what they have been through.

They said: 'Thomas was an energetic 14-month-old boy - he was a proper boy.

'He did everything you'd expect him to do the week before going into hospital - he was standing on his rocking chair, climbing up the stairs.

'We wouldn't want any other families to have to go through what we have since Thomas' death and hope by our actions we can help other children and their families in the future.'

Thomas was born on January 21, 2010, but within a year his parents were taking him to the GP on a weekly basis for viruses and infections.

Two days before he died, Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching.

Mr and Mrs Duffy took him to the GP as usual, but were reassured by two different family doctors that he was healthy and 'thriving'.

Eight hours later he began to struggle to breathe, and Mr and Mrs Duffy rushed to the A&E department at their local hospital.

January 21, 2010: Baby Thomas Duffy was born healthy after a normal pregnancy.

July 2010: Thomas started to suffer from viral symptoms including a wheeze, a cough and diarrhoea. The GP diagnosed an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

August 2010 - December 2010: Thomas was repeatedly taken to the GP where doctors diagnosed URTIs, chest infections and bronchiolitis. He was prescribed inhalers and regular antibiotics.

January 2011: Thomas became increasingly unwell and his parents were attending his GP surgery on almost a weekly basis. He was never referred for further investigations.

February 2011: Thomas deteriorated and suffered from frequent vomiting. He was diagnosed with an ear infection, followed by oral thrush, a URTI and a chest infection throughout February.

March 2011: Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching. The family were again reassured by the GP on both March 17 and 18.

March 19, 2011: Thomas’ breathing became laboured and the family attended A&E. His enlarged heart went undiagnosed and he suffered a cardiac arrest and died. 

He was treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis- blood poisoning – as his condition deteriorated.

He seemed to improve with the treatment, but hours later suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

John Ellery, the assistant coroner in Shropshire concluded that Thomas died from an underlying heart condition that should have been diagnosed much earlier.

If appropriate treatment had been given, Thomas would not have died when he did, he added.

Mr Ellery, who was sitting at Stourport Coroners Court, said a post-mortem found Thomas was suffering from a condition affecting the main pumping chamber of heart.

But he said the life-threatening problem should have been identified by a paediatrician when he was brought into A&E at the Alexandra Hospital.

The coroner also criticised the hospital's on-call paediatrician for not attending despite repeated requests by nursing staff - saying it amounted to a 'gross failure'.

Mr Ellery said he planned to write to the Trust Development Agency and NHS England to ensure that lessons were learnt from Thomas's death.

It was the third inquest Mr and Mrs Duffy have been forced to undergo to get a public account of their son's death, that they felt was accurate and fair.

The first inquest was held in June 2011 and came to the conclusion Thomas died of natural causes.

But the verdict was quashed by a judicial review brought by the couple, who were concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence.

And a second inquest, held in December last year, had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence.

Speaking after the inquest, Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hoped Thomas's case would prevent other couples from going through a similar ordeal.

Mrs Duffy said parents were repeatedly told Thomas's illnesses, including frequent chest infections, were normal for a child of his age.

Mr and Mrs Duffy said Thomas was a 'cheeky - a wonderful little boy'

'Every time we went to the GP they said he was a normal, healthy child and he was never referred for a routine hospital appointment' she said.

'On the two days leading up to Thomas's death he was seen twice by the GP and considered a thriving child.

'But just eight to 10 hours later we had to rush him to hospital with severe breathing difficulties.

'On admission Thomas was originally treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis as his condition deteriorated.

'After a morning of intense treatment we were informed Thomas was in a stable condition but an hour or so later he suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and died.

'It was only after a post-mortem examination that we learned of Thomas's heart condition.'

The couple lived in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire when Thomas passed away in March 2011 but have since moved to Shirley, near Solihull in the West Midlands.

After Thomas's death they went on to have another son, Luke, now two, and Mrs Duffy is due to give birth to their third child next month.

'Luke has been our tonic. He was the focus we needed to move on and now we are looking forward to our third baby next month.' the couple said.

Paying tribute to Thomas, the couple added: 'Thomas was just amazing. He enjoyed everything about life and he had a wonderful smile - everywhere he went everyone would comment on his beautiful smile.

'He was cheeky - a wonderful little boy.'

Penny Venables, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, has now issued an apology to the family.

She said: 'We accept the coroner's conclusions and we deeply regret that, in this case, we did get things wrong.

'In the three and a half years since Thomas's death the trust has made significant changes to ensure that the issues highlighted will not be repeated.'

She added the coroner had said he was reassured lessons had been learned from Thomas's death and the trust had offered to meet with the parents to discuss measures which had put in place to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.

Kay Kelly, a solicitor at Lanyon Bowdler who represented Mr and Mrs Duffy, said: 'The parents of baby Thomas have been forced to go through three separate inquests to gain the answers to their questions as to how and why their beautiful baby son died.'

The hospital trust who run the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, have apologised to the family and said that they 'did get things wrong'
