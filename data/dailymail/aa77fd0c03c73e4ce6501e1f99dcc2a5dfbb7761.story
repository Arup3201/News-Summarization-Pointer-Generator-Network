Top U.S. intelligence officials said on Saturday that information gleaned from two controversial data-collection programs run by the National Security Agency thwarted potential terrorist plots in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries - and that gathered data is destroyed every five years.

Last year, fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of U.S. phone records gathered daily by the NSA in one of the programs, the intelligence officials said in arguing that the programs are far less sweeping than their detractors allege.

No other new details about the plots or the countries involved were part of the newly declassified information released to Congress on Saturday and made public by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The NSA Threat Operations Center: Hundreds of millions of records of U.S. phone calls were collected under a provision of the Patriot Act with just only 300 'queried' in 2012 for additional information about the callers

Intelligence officials said they are working to declassify the dozens of plots NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander said were disrupted, to show Americans the value of the programs, but that they want to make sure they don't inadvertently reveal parts of the U.S. counterterrorism playbook in the process.

The release of information follows a bruising week for U.S. intelligence officials who testified on Capitol Hill, defending programs that were unknown to the public - and some lawmakers - until they were revealed by a series of media stories in The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers, leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who remains in hiding in Hong Kong.

Edward Snowden: He told the South China Morning Post this week that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide, including many in Hong Kong and mainland China

Support: Hundreds of people in Hong Kong have marched to the US consulate in support of ex-CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The protesters demanded that local authorities protect Mr Snowden, who is in hiding in Hong Kong

The disclosures have sparked debate and legal action against the Obama administration by privacy activists who say the data collection goes far beyond what was intended when expanded counterterrorism measures were authorized by Congress after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Intelligence officials said Saturday that both NSA programs are reviewed every 90 days by the secret court authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Under the program, the records, showing things like time and length of call, can only be examined for suspected connections to terrorism, they said.

The officials offered more detail on how the phone records program helped the NSA stop a 2009 al-Qaida plot to blow up New York City subways.

Gen. Keith B. Alexander, director of the National Security Agency and head of the U.S. Cyber Command: He defended the internet and telephone data snooping programmes, saying they had disrupted dozens of terror plots

They say the program helped them track a co-conspirator of al-Qaida operative Najibullah Zazi - though it's not clear why the FBI needed the NSA to investigate Zazi's phone records because the FBI would have had the authority to gather records of Zazi's phone calls after identifying him as a suspect, rather than relying on the sweeping collection program.

In revealing some of the foiled plots, the NSA has also acknowledged in a new classified briefing that it does not need court authorization to listen to domestic phone calls.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, disclosed this week that during a secret briefing to members of Congress, he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed 'simply based on an analyst deciding that.'

If the NSA wants 'to listen to the phone,' an analyst's decision is sufficient, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he learned. 'I was rather startled,' said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee.

Defense: Intelligence officials have insisted agents do not listen in on Americans' telephone conversations and maintain the internet communications surveillance programmer targeted only non-Americans located outside of the US

Not only does this disclosure shed more light on how the NSA's formidable eavesdropping apparatus works domestically it also suggests the Justice Department has secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of low-ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls.

The same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages.

The disclosure appears to confirm some of the allegations made by Edward Snowden, a former NSA infrastructure analyst who leaked classified documents to the Guardian. Snowden said in a video interview that, while not all NSA analysts had this ability, he could from Hawaii 'wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president.'

Supporting Snowden: Hong Kong's government says it does not comment on individual cases but will follow any request according to the law. Analysts say any attempts to bring Mr Snowden to America may take months and could be blocked by Beijing

Earlier reports have indicated that the NSA has the ability to record nearly all domestic and international phone calls -- in case an analyst needed to access the recordings in the future.

Wlliam Binney, a former NSA technical director who helped to modernize the agency's worldwide eavesdropping network, told the Daily Caller this week that the NSA records the phone calls of 500,000 to 1 million people who are on its so-called target list, and perhaps even more. 'They look through these phone numbers and they target those and that's what they record,' Binney said.

Former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente told CNN last month that, in national security investigations, the bureau can access records of a previously made telephone call. 'All of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not,' he said. Clemente added in an appearance the next day that, thanks to the 'intelligence community' -- an apparent reference to the NSA -- 'there's a way to look at digital communications in the past.'

NSA Director Keith Alexander said this week that his agency's analysts abide by the law: "They do this lawfully. They take compliance oversight, protecting civil liberties and privacy and the security of this nation to their heart every day."
