It is one thing offering somebody a helping hand.

But this man gave a lot more than he bargained for.

Supporting his colleague in a training session as she prepared to be Tasered, the US security squadron had no idea that he too would be struck with pain just seconds later.

As the woman is hit, she screams with pain and clutches the first thing she can get her hand on: his crotch.Â

Caught off-guard, the airman strives to keep hold of his attacker as he bends over in pain - while the room erupts with laughter.

As the taser stops and the woman falls to the ground, he tumbles across the room groaning in agony.

The scene at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas was captured on August 8 last year by Airman 1st Class Armando A Schwier-Morales, but until this week it has been kept under wraps.

In the monthly course, the recruits are trained to use and understand tasers before they can carry one.

Out of the 40-strong classes, only a quarter of the students step up to feel the force for themselves.

Sergeant Gregory Oglesby, who leads the training, said: 'It feels like you've got electricity going through your body, you can't move.

'You actually feel it going through your nervous system and your muscles lock up.'
