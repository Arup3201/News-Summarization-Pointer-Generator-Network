Winston Churchill's one and only effort at poetry as an adult has come to light more than 110 years after he put pen to paper.

The wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter, prolific author and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature.

Yet despite being a lover of poetry, he was only known to have written verse once - and that was for a competition when he was at Harrow School.

Now, a 40-line poem - describing the eve of a naval battle - penned over two pages in blue crayon by Churchill while he was in the Army, has emerged for sale at auction in London.

Our Modern Watchwords - a 40-line poem describing the eve of a naval battle - was penned over two pages in blue crayon by Winston Churchill while he was in the Army. It is now set for auction

The poem is signed by Churchill (above) and was written while he served in the 4th Hussars, in about 1898

Unsurprisingly, the poem is a rousing celebration of the British Empire and of going to war to defend her.

It is said to have been influenced by Kipling and Tennyson.

It is signed by Churchill and was written over two sides on the headed notepaper of his regiment, the 4th Hussars, in about 1898.

The first ten lines of the work, entitled Our Modern Watchwords, read:

The shadow falls along the shore

The search lights twinkle on the sea

The silence of a mighty fleet

Portends the tumult yet to be.

The tables of the evening meal

Are spread amid the great machines

And thus with pride the question runs

Among the sailors and marines

Breathes there the man who fears to die

For England, Home, & Wai-hai-wai.

The poem makes reference to obscure cities under the rule of the British Empire like Wai-hai-wai - Weihai in China - Sokoto in Nigeria and Karochaw in Japan.

It was most certainly written by the former Prime Minister before 1901 as there is a reference to Queen Victoria.

It was acquired several years ago by Roy Davids, a retired rare manuscript dealer from Great Haseley in Oxfordshire.

Mr Davids, 70, said: 'This is the only poem in Churchill's handwriting as an adult.

'There is one at Harrow School but that was one he wrote as a boy and it was for a competition.

'The archive at the Churchill College at Cambridge University has never heard of another poem and that is a pretty certain statement.

Unsurprisingly, the poem is a rousing celebration of the British Empire and of going to war to defend her. Above, Winston Churchill in Bangalore in 1896

'I don't think it's a bad effort, it is quite competent. It is quite rousing stuff and is an imperial celebratory poem that references cities that stretch across the British Empire.

'It is interesting that nearly 50 years after the death of the most famous Englishman of the 20th century, we are still discovering new aspects of his life.'

At the time of writing the poem, Churchill, who was also a talented artist, was an Army war correspondent and had served in countries such as India and Sudan.

He produced it before he fought in the second Boer War a year later.

Allen Packwood, the director of the Churchill Archive Centre at Churchill College, Cambridge, said: 'Of course he was a great writer and orator and he used poetry in some of his famous speeches.

The wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter, prolific author and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature

'He was someone who was greatly influenced by poetry and was able to memorise and recite large parts of other people's poetry.

'But it is rare to find a piece of poetry by him as an adult. I am not aware of any others that exist.

'Having read it, it seems to me that it was part-influenced by Kipling and Tennyson and the sort of poems he would have read at school.'

A spokesman for auctioneers Bonhams said: 'We don't of course usually think of Winston Churchill as a poet but perhaps we should not be surprised to find that he wrote verse.

'He was a man of many parts who, over the course of a long life, threw himself enthusiastically into a whole range of activities beyond his main calling as a politician and statesman.

'The work certainly provides a fascinating extra insight into the life of one of the country's greatest figures.'

The poem has been given a conservative estimate of Â£15,000. It will be sold at auction on April 10.
