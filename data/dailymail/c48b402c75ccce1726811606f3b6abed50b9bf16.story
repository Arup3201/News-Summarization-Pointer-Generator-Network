Environment Agency chiefs spent £700,000 more on public relations than it would have cost to carry out dredging work that may have prevented flooding on the Somerset Levels, it has been revealed.

The Government agency chose not to spend £1.7million on dredging stretches of the River Tone and the River Parrett before the recent flooding left much of the crisis-hit Somerset Levels underwater.

However, bosses at the Environment Agency did spend at least £2.4million on PR activities.

Costly: The Environment Agency spent £2.4million on PR activities, but chose not to spend £1.7million on dredging stretches of the River Tone and the River Parrett before the recent flooding left much of the crisis-hit Somerset Levels, including a number of villages, underwater

Surrounded: Many areas have been completely cut off by flood water, including the small community at Burrowbridge on the banks of the River Parrett

Underwater: Mark Kirby and his wife, Kate with their children, Dom, 16, Georgine, 14 and Theo, 10, inside their flooded home in Moorland

The figure, revealed in request under the Freedom of Information Act by The Sun, does not include the salaries of the agency's PR staff.

'It's disgraceful. They don't want to do the work until they absolutely have to,' Bryony Sadler from campaigners Flooding on the Levels Action Group told The Sun.

There were repeated calls for dredging on the Somerset Levels made to government departments by farmers and others in the region at least six months ago. However, funding was declined.

Many families have been forced to leave their homes with villages including Moorland, Currymore, Muchelney, Thorney, Burrowbridge and Westonzoyland all flooded or cut off and surrounded by water.

According to Prime Minister David Cameron, who visited the region last week, the area has not been dredged since the late 1990s, and this had made it more prone to flooding.

He blamed the last Labour government for the pause in dredging, a process which removes silt from river channels, and said that as soon as the flood waters subsided the area should be dredged.

Last week Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith said that just £400,000 had been set aside for dredging, and that this had not been enough.

The quango was instead waiting for other agencies to put forward money to enable dredging to begin.

Fourteen Environment Agency executives take home salaries of more than £100,000 a year.

The Environment Agency
 has said that an increased amount of dredging would not have stopped the current flooding in Somerset, due to the unprecedented amount of water.

It said that it had spent £45m in the last financial year on improving river flow 
across England, including clearing weeds and dredging.

The Environment Agency has defended the money spent on PR and said: 'Money sepnt on communications is within strict government guidelines.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has now been put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by David Cameron, said Lord Smith should make a public apology for the Environment Agency's mistakes.

And asked whether the former Cabinet Minister, should resign, Mr Pickles said bluntly: ‘He has to make his own decision.’

‘We made a mistake, there's no doubt about that and we perhaps relied too much on the Environment Agency's advice,’ Mr Pickles told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.

‘We recognise that we should have dredged and I think it is important now that we get on the process of getting those people back into their houses once we are able to really do some serious pumping.’

Mr Pickles has criticised under-fire Agency chairman Lord Smith for refusing to say sorry for the failures when he was besieged by angry locals on visit to the area.

Asked if Prime Minister David Cameron should also apologise, Mr Pickles said: ‘I'll apologise. I'll apologise unreservedly.

‘I am really sorry that we took the advice ... we thought we were dealing with experts.’

The Agency was ‘fit for purpose’ and its staff were doing a fantastic job on the ground dealing with the floods but there were serious questions about parts of its leadership, he said.

Hitting back at ministers in the growing row over the handling of devastating winter storms Lord Smith insisted his staff knew 'a hundred times' more than any politician.

He also squarely blamed Treasury funding rules for failure to dredge rivers, and again insisted he had no intention of resigning.

Lord Smith said he had 'kept his counsel' up until now over Government funding and rules.

'When I hear someone criticising the expertise and professionalism of my staff in the Environment Agency who know more about flood risk management - 100 times more about flood risk management - than any politician ever does, I am not, I'm afraid, going to sit idly by,' he said.

'The EA is bound by the rules that are laid down by the Government. So when someone says that we followed the advice of the EA, what they were actually doing is following the Treasury rules that say how much we can spend and how much we cannot spend on any individual flood defence scheme.'

The former Labour Cabinet minister said the Environment Agency was previously permitted to allocate only £400,000 to Somerset, and no other funding came forward.

'The situation now has completely changed because not only has the Government come up with some extra money for Somerset, but they have said the Treasury rules won't apply to Somerset.'

He added that 'money absolutely is a big part of the issue'.

Lord Smith was asked about reports that Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who was leading the Government flooding response before being forced to undergo an eye operation, complained to Downing Street about Mr Pickles' criticism of the EA.

'I have indeed spoken with Owen Paterson by text... he has been hugely supportive throughout of the Environment Agency, its staff and its work and I very much appreciate that.'
