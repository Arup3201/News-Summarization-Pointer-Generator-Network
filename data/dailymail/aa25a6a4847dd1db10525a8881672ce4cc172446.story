Residents who are fed-up of dealing with overflowing bins due to fortnightly rubbish collections are jumping at the chance to sign up for a new private waste collection service available for just £5.50.

The ‘pay-as-you-throw’ service known as Rubbish Service Ltd - will fill
 in between council-provided services for a small fee charged directly to 
customers in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

The business was launched by businessman Andrew Brown who created the service to go door-to-door to pick up rubbish which can then be either disposed or recycled.

Rubbish Service Ltd: Residents can opt for up to three plastic sacks which are collected from their doorstep

Mr Brown said: ‘We
 are totally supportive of the move away from landfill and incineration 
towards more recycling, but the simple fact is that many households 
simply can't cope with having their rubbish collected once a fortnight.

‘Some households produce 
more waste than others on a weekly basis, because they have more people 
in them, while others might benefit from occasional extra collections.'

He added: 'We have already signed up dozens of keen customers, even before we get up and running.’

Bin collection: Many residents across the country are fed-up of overflowing bins

Harrogate will play host to this summer’s Tour de France. However residents are among many around the country that now have their rubbish collected fortnightly.

But this could change as the Government has launched new guidelines for councils to get more authorities to return to weekly pick-ups.

Yet many are reluctant to overturn the controversial policy.

Meanwhile, Rubbish Service Ltd. says it will offer private waste collections for as little as £5.50 with either weekly or fortnightly collection.

Three large plastic sacks are provided as part of the fee to be collected from the doorstep or roadside for disposal and recycling.

The service has already seen strong demand from small businesses interested in the soon-to-be launched service.

It is being tested in certain postcodes from the end of May, with a view to extending the service to other towns and boroughs in the future.
