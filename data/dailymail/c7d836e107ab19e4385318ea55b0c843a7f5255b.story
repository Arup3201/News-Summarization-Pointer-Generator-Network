This is the moment a pair of burglars who were seen loitering in a suspicious-looking car on a residential street were caught on camera by a nosy neighbour - who they then tried to run over.

When the neighbourhood watch member saw what he thought might be trouble in his street in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, he grabbed his mobile phone and began filming. 

He then approached the black VW Golf, which was parked up on his street, with burglary suspects Carl Armitage and David Hindle inside.

But the driver spotted the man and suddenly reversed towards him, narrowly missing him and smashing into a telegraph pole.

Despite the near-miss, the determined neighbour managed to take clear photos of the car - which have now been used to help jail the gang with which the two burglars were involved.

After they were sentenced, officers paid tribute to the 'brave' man, who they said had helped prevent further burglaries.  

The group had been responsible for a series of raids across Huddersfield in which they had collectively stolen around £10,000 worth of gold jewellery.

The pair who were caught on camera by the man have now been jailed at Leeds Crown Court for their parts in the burglaries.

Armitage, 24, from Bradford, was sentenced to four years in prison while Hindle, 35, also from Bradford, was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Despite their attempts to run him over when he approached the black VW Golf, the neighbourhood watch man took this photo of the suspicious-looking car outside his home in Huddersfield and handed it into police

Hindle had already been convicted in July this year of dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. He was jailed for 16 weeks.

But the two men later admitted handling stolen goods after it emerged that the car in which they were filmed had been stolen during an earlier burglary in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.

Another defendant, Stephen Drake, 33, from Knottingley, West Yorkshire, admitted two counts of burglary and one attempted burglary. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Joseph Devanney, 25, from Bradford, was also jailed for two years and five months and banned from driving for 12 months after admitting attempted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and perverting the course of justice.

Hindle, 35, (left) and Armitage, 24, (right), were jailed at Leeds Crown Court for their roles in several burglaries which targeted Asian families for jewellery 

He had crashed a car and persuaded his partner to report it stolen, the court heard. 

And a fifth man, 29-year-old Scott Moore, also from Bradford, admitted burglary, handling a stolen car, common assault on a custody officer and possessing drugs.

He was jailed for 30 months and disqualified from driving for 12 months.

Detective Constable Iain Campbell, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The significant sentences given to Hindle and Armitage come as a result of a 15-month investigation which uncovered links between the pair and a series of burglaries committed across the Kirklees area.

'The determination of officers to put these two career burglars behind bars shows the priority we give to tackling incidents of burglary.

After the five-man gang were jailed, a police officer paid tribute to the neighbour for his 'brave' actions in taking the photos, including this one 

'I would also like to pay tribute to the neighbourhood watch member who saw Hindle and Armitage acting suspiciously and filmed them on his mobile phone.

'When the men realised they were being filmed they reversed their vehicle towards the witness narrowly missing him and colliding with a telegraph pole.

'The brave actions of the witness clearly prevented another victim of burglary and I would like to publicly acknowledge our gratitude for their help.'

The court heard the gang repeatedly targeted Asian families for jewellery. Raids happened in locations across West Yorkshire.

Sentencing the gang, Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'It is perfectly clear to me that premises were targeted in this case for high value goods and that the individual burglaries were subjected to careful planning.

'Burglary can have a terrible effect on those who are the victims.'
