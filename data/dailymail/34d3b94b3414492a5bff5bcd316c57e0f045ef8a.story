Former President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that his wife says she won't run for the White House in 2016 - but mischievously said he didn't have 'any idea' if she was telling the truth. 

'You know, she — we're not kids any more,' he told NBC shortly before taking to the stage for his big speech at the Democratic convention on Charlotte.

'I don't have any idea if she'll ever run again," Clinton said. 'She says she won't.'

In a rollicking, rousing address that lasted 50 minutes and ended well after 11pm, Clinton gave a full-throated endorsement to the man whose campaign portrayed him as a racist in 2008 and left considerable bitterness on both sides.

Clinton's endorsement of his wife's former rival and willingness to throw his full weight behind Obama represented a public rapprochement between the two Democratic camps.

His speech also set off a frenzy of speculation over the 2016 race. While Clinton was on his feet, the hash tag '#Hillary 2016' became the top trend on Twitter in the U.S.

The trend reached its peak ten minutes after Clinton mentioned her in his speech.

He praised Obama for bringing his vanquished rival into the tent: 'He appointed Cabinet members who supported Hillary in the primaries. Heck, he even appointed Hillary!' Clinton said to loud cheers and a standing ovation.

He added: 'I'm so proud of her and grateful to our entire national security team.'

When her husband was speaking, Mrs Clinton was 9,930 miles in Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste in south-east Asia. She watched the speech via SlingPlayer on an aide's TiVo via the U.S. ambassador's home computer.

A Clinton adviser told Politico's Playbook: 'From the moment the introductory video came on, she was riveted - as were the members of the travelling party who watched with her. It's safe to say that she loved every single minute of it. It's possible she did not blink even once. 

'When the speech ended, she was as surprised and excited as everyone in the arena and watching at home when President Obama joined President Clinton on stage. She had no idea it was coming, she cheered and practically jumped out of her chair.'

At a press conference in Dili before she watched the speech, Mrs Clinton said she had read parts of the speech and was anxious to compare the 'as prepared' remarks to those 'as delivered' - a wise precaution because he added in about 20 minutes more material. 

'It is a great honour for him to be nominating the president,' she said. 'This is the first convention I've missed in many, many years.'

As America's top diplomat, the former First Lady and U.S. Senator for New York cannot by tradition participate in politics. 

Chelsea Clinton, now a special correspondent for NBC News, led a panel on civic engagement for youth before listening to her father's speech in the convention hall.

'It was great,' Mrs Clinton told reporters aboard her plane as she prepared to leave Timor-Leste. She said she spoke with her husband during the drive to the airport.

After his early reference to Obama's appointing her, Clinton didn't mention 
his wife again, but the subtext was clear - the Clintons remain the most powerful force within the Democratic Party.

Characteristically, Clinton took his time, using the 50-minute speech both to reaffirm his 
support for Obama and to remind voters of the robust economy he presided
over during two terms in the White House with Mrs Clinton by his side.

In
nominating Obama as the Democratic standard-bearer, Mr Clinton said 
the president began the long road to recovery and has laid the 
foundation for a stronger economy. 

As Obama listened with delegates to the Democratic convention, Mr 
Clinton said Americans have a choice between the winner-take-all society
supported by Republicans and a Democratic vision of shared 
responsibility and prosperity. 

Clinton,
rebutting the Republican contention that the economy has worsened under  Obama, said Republicans would return to the failed policies of the 
past.

He posed his own version of the Republicans' 'Are you better off?' question: 'What kind of country do you want to live in?'

Clinton
said that is the most important question facing the nation as it 
decides whether to return 'r Obama to the White House or replace him 
with Republican Mitt Romney. 

'If
you want a "you're-on-your-own, winner-take-all" society, you should 
support the Republican ticket,' Mr Clinton said. 'If you want a country 
of shared prosperity and shared responsibility - a 
we're-all-in-this-together society - you should vote for Barack Obama 
and Joe Biden.'

Clinton said Obama inherited a damaged economy and 'put a floor under the crash'. He said he then laid the foundation for a more balanced economy that will produce millions of jobs, new businesses and riches to innovators.

The former president appeared at the convention as Obama's top validator - an antidote to Republican claims that Mr Obama has made the economy worse and a reminder of a recent period in history when the economy boomed. 

The Obama campaign sent out a fundraising email under Mr Clinton's name yesterday. The message: 'It is absolutely urgent we win this election.'

Earlier, Clinton told NBC News he was not trying to promote another presidential campaign for his wife, who will be 69 in 2016. 

The former president said: 'We're not kids any more. I don't have any idea if she'll ever run again. She says she won't.'

Clinton's popularity has soared since her bruising campaign against Obama, and she would begin the 2016 nomination contest as a heavy favourite if she were to pursue it. 

After Clinton finished his speech, several of his former aides hugged and slapped high-fives in the back of the arena.

Long-time adviser Harold Ickes beamed with pride.

He said: 'He knows how to make the case. I've seen him make the case even when he doesn't have much to work with. He has a lot to work with. He made a very powerful case for re-election.'
