A Banksy artwork ripped down from a north London street is to be auctioned, just months after another in the same borough was controversially sold for a reported £750,000.

No Ball Games was removed from the side of a shop in Turnpike Lane, Tottenham Green, and will be sold next year by the Sincura Group - the company which arranged the sale of Slave Labour in May.

The Sincura Group claims the street graffiti, which shows two children playing with a sign that reads No Ball Games, has been 'salvaged for renovation' and is now under their management.

Sincura Group intends to sell the artwork, created by street artist Banksy in 2009, next year and in the meantime it has been 'gifted' to a local charity

A statement on its website reads: 'A number of attempts have been made over the past to deface the piece, most famously in 2012 by King Robbo who holds a rivalry with the elusive artist.

'With extensive building works taking place in the local vicinity, and further concerns upon its safety, the piece has been removed to be sensitively restored to its former glory.'

It added that it intends to sell the artwork, created by street artist Banksy in 2009, next year and in the meantime it has been 'gifted' to a local charity.

The company sparked outrage among residents earlier this year when it announced it was selling Slave Labour, which depicts a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting.

The unsuccessful campaign to return the 
'symbol of local pride' to Wood Green was supported by Haringey Council,
 which now faces the prospect of a second battle.

But the company insists it has committed no 'wrongdoing'.

'The Sincura Group do not condone any acts of wanton vandalism or other illegal activity, however after carrying out extensive due diligence with regard the works' provenance and ownership we are entirely satisfied that there are no wrong-doings entered in to and are happy to be representing the No Ball Games piece,' the statement added.

No Ball Games will be one of three 'controversial headline pieces' to be sold at the auction.

A spokesman for Haringey Borough Council told the Haringey Independent that it is trying to contact the owners of the building to find out more information.

This is not the first time a mural by the famous guerilla artist has been removed to be restored.

In May a giant Banksy on the side of a crumbling Grade II listed building with an estimated value of £1million was removed.

The giant rat, which was created by Britain's most famous street artist, has been eroding for years, with large parts having peeled off with the plaster or vanished on rotted wood.

But a special restoration team were drafted in to remove the painting from the old Whitehorse pub in Liverpool's China town as part of plans to re-open the building.

Bristol-born Banksy daubed the huge rat wielding a machine gun on the Georgian building as part of the city's Biennial art programme in 2004.

Banksy has since conquered the art world, selling his unique pieces for millions, and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie amongst his fans.

Britain's biggest Banksy, previously valued at £1million, adorned the pub and campaigns to restore the artwork, have led to its inclusion in plans to gain planning permission from Liverpool city council.

In London Banksy art trails are a huge draw for tourists and special crack teams ensure his graffiti stays in top condition.
