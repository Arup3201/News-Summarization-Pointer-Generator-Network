Claws the monster lobster won't ever be catch of the day - because he is too big for the cooking pot.

The two-and-a-half foot crustacean was hauled out of the sea near Lyme Regis, Dorset and is believed to be at least 60 years old.

Now he is being looked after at the town's aquarium for the summer before he returns to the sea.

Claws the lobster was caught in Lyme Bay off the Dorset coast but is too big and old to become a meal

The lobster's crushing claw is 'abnormally large', according to owner Max Gollop

Owner Max Gollop said the lobster was rare because of its age and size and its abnormally large crushing claw.

'I haven't seen many that big,' he said.

'The crushing claw is especially big.

'Fishermen get paid for the weight when selling lobsters but over a certain limit that doesn't apply because the meat is too tough.

Instead of the cooking pot, Claws's summer destination is the Lyme Regis Aquarium

Children are 'in awe' of Claws's size, according to his owner Max Gollop

'You can say he was saved by his size.

'He'll stay with us at the aquarium for summer then in September we'll release him back into the sea.'

He added: 'The kids are in awe of him'.

His size and age mean he won't end up on a plate but will stay at aquarium
