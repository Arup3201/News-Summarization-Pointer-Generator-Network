After seeing off India to reach the final of the cricket World Cup, Australia were shown incredible support from across their country.

Fans in Sydney, where they won the semi-final, celebrated raucously, while those in Melbourne awaited their arrival for Sunday's showdown against New Zealand.

And there was even support in between, as airline Qantas provided special headrests for the flight with the slogan '#GoGold'.
