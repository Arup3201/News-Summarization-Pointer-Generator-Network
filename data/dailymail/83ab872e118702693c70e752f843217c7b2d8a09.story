A bomber pilot who starred in a James Bond movie has vented his anger after he was finally awarded a campaign medal - 68 years after the Second World War ended.

Wing Commander Ken Wallis, 97, risked his life as he flew his Wellington war-plane over Germany on 28 missions during the conflict.

The patriotic young hero and brilliant flyer was so determined to fight for his country in its most dangerous hour that he even cheated in an eye test to get into the RAF.

Mr Wallis, from Reymerston, near Dereham, Norfolk, was convinced he and his crewmates would be recognised for their phenomenal bravery after fighting in 103 Squadron, based at RAF Elsham Wolds in north Lincolnshire.

But the bombers, who suffered horrific losses in the war, faced a political backlash after Hitler was beaten as their vital role in the victory was played down.

After finally receiving his Bomber Command golden clasp, Mr Wallis said: 'It's a bit late - and long over-due.

'There were 56,000 who were killed in Bomber Command and when we finished operations we thought we would get medals.

'And it was a terrible disappointment when we didn't get them.'

The great-grandfather said they were turned into 'villains' after controversial Bomber Command chief, Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, decided to carpet bomb German cities in a devastating night-time offensive.

'They thought we were bombing these poor
 innocent Germans, but there was never a moment of pleasure when we did 
it,' insisted Mr Wallis.

'None of us wanted to do the job.'

He said that he focused purely on dropping his bomb-load and hitting his targets during his 28 raids across Germany.

Mr Wallis applied to join the RAF's volunteer reserve service before war erupted in 1939.

He was rejected because of poor sight in his right eye but managed to get a private flying licence after his GP failed to check his eyesight when he signed him off.

Incredibly Mr Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours.

He was 25 when he finally made it into the RAF at the outbreak of war when he cheated his optician in his final eye test by reading the letters back with his 'good eye' when the doctor wasn't looking.

Mr Wallis soon stood out and on tough nine-hour missions the pilot and his team of six carried out the first and third raids on Baltic port Rostock.

He said they all knew that at least five or six bombers would not return that night after seeing action over enemy territory.

'We had arrangements that if you didn't come back then your traditional bacon and eggs at breakfast the next morning would be given to someone else,' recalled Ken.

After being hit in one sortie Mr Wallis had to bale out of his plane in thick fog.

He injured his spine after hitting the ground and was awarded a gold braid, known as a wound stripe, on his left arm.

Mr Wallis moved to Norfolk after finally leaving the RAF in 1964 - and promptly went on to carve out an exciting new career in the air.

The exceptional airman made headlines after flying as Hollywood star Sean Connery's stunt double in 'You Only Live Twice' in his autogyros in the huge 1967 James Bond hit.

He was made an MBE in 1996 and between 1968 and 2002 he set a stunning 34 world records for speed, circuit and altitude feats.

Many of his staggering landmarks still stand - including the 129mph top speed for a 3km flight in the tiny rotor-powered aircraft.

The airmen of Bomber Command learned just last year that their would finally be rewarded, nearly 70 years after the end of the war.

The announcement was made as Prime Minister David Cameron also revealed, in December, that the veterans of the Arctic Convoys would be given campaign medals.

In a linked announcement, Mr Cameron said the airmen of Bomber Command would get a campaign clasp to match the Battle of Britain clasp given to Fighter Command personnel.

The Prime Minister told MPs he had accepted the recommendations of a review of military medals carried out by former diplomat Sir John Holmes.

He found that Bomber Command personnel were unfairly treated – in part because the bombing of Germany was criticised after the war.

Mr Cameron told MPs he agreed ‘the heroic aircrews should be awarded a Bomber Command Clasp’ and said: ‘I am very pleased that some of the brave men of the Arctic Convoys will get the recognition they so richly deserve for the very dangerous work they did.’

Two war veterans have finally been recognised for their heroic efforts fighting the Nazis after waiting 70 years.

Dr Yves Dias and Matthew Usher endured sub-zero temperatures and brutal attacks from German forces while they, along with thousands of other men, battled to get much-needed food supplies to allied troops in Russia during the Second World War.

The pair, both from Gosforth, Newcastle, were able to apply for the prestigious Arctic Star medal which recognises veterans of the Arctic convoys.

It is a retrospective award and was formally approved by The Queen last year.

No presentation ceremony comes with the medal, so both men received their honours from the postman.

But when staff at Trinity Church, in Gosforth, where both men attend different 90-plus events, heard of their awards, they decided to stage a proper ceremony.

Friends and family gathered in the church this week to watch as Lieutenant Commander Duncan Young, executive officer of the Royal Navy's HMS Calliope, presented them with their awards.

Dr Dias, 90, was just 16 when he started in the Merchant Navy after being educated at a cadet school. He was quickly brought into the Navy, where he served in what he described as 'frightening' missions during the Second World War.

He said: 'It was a very hairy time 
and we were right at the front from start to finish. I had a wonderful 
view of it from the bridge of HMS Rodney.

The Arctic convoys of the Second World War were described by Winston Churchill as 'the toughest journey, the worst journey in the world'.

The convoys sailed from the UK, Iceland, and North America to ports in the Soviet Union - modern day Russia. There were a total of 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 sailing via several seas of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.

About 1,400 merchant ships delivered vital supplies to the Soviet Union, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the US Navy.

Eighty-five merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost. The Nazi German Kriegsmarine lost a number of vessels including one battleship, three destroyers and at least 30 U-boats as well as a large number of aircraft.

The gruelling journeys endured by British servicemen involved had never been formally recognised until last year when the Arctic Star medal was introduced. 

'It was a very busy war and very frightening. I did what I had to do to survive and thanking God that I was here.

'I was hoping that if I was going to be wounded that it would be quick.'

Mr Usher joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer when he was 18, and after his training he joined the 846 Avenger Squadron, which saw him assigned to a number of different ships.

But the hardy 89-year-old didn't let the extreme conditions, both in terms of the weather and the constant attacks from the enemy, get the better of the mission at hand.

Mr Usher, who lives with wife Gwen, said: 'We made the most of it. There was one horrible day on the way to Russia when this Avenger crashed and exploded. There was petrol all over the place. A man was carried into the hangar, but he had already been burned to death. He was buried at sea.'

He added: 'Our convoy was the first to get through to Russia without losing one ship of supplies.'

Dr Dias and Mr Usher were praised by Lt Cdr Young when he handed them their Arctic Stars.

He said: 'I am humbled to have been given the great honour of presenting two Arctic Convoy medals. I think it is a disgrace that they came through the post, so the Royal Navy is delighted to present them properly.'

The ceremony was organised by Mary Bellshaw, pastoral and community worker at Trinity Church, and also featured a performance by choir Northern Lights.
