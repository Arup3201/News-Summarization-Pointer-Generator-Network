Georgia police were called to help a man who was stabbed and locked in the bathroom of a friend's apartment after a date at a nearby McDonald's that was arranged through a mobile dating app.

The two men originally contacted each other on Tinder, a popular mobile app, and agreed to meet up in September at a McDonald's just off the parkway in Kennesaw.

The meeting went well at first, and the two returned to an apartment owned by the victim's friend located 20 minutes away in northwest Atlanta.

According to a police report, the victim said the two were 'fooling around' when the other man began stabbing him with what the victim thought was a pocket knife.

He said his assailant then forced him into the bathroom and locked him inside while he made off with his money and his Honda Accord.

The victim managed to escape from the bathroom and stumbled out of the apartment where he ran across a yard crew working outside.

He was bleeding from four stab wounds, according to WSBTV and was transported by ambulance to the hospital.

Police are still looking for the suspect and it is not clear whether the stabbing and theft were planned ahead of time.

This is not the first time that a date arranged through the Tinder app has taken a violent turn.

In August, Australian Gable Tostee, 28, was accused of murder after a New Zealand tourist he met on Tinder and brought back to his apartment fell 14 floors to her death.

An audio recording captured what police believe are the sounds of Tostee making Warriena Wright, 26, drink homemade vodka before having rough sex with her.

Later in the recording, Tostee apparently locks Wright outside on the balcony for being 'a bad girl' before a scream is heard as Wright falls off the balcony.

Fell: Wright was apparently left on a balcony at Tostee's apartment before she plummeted 14 stories to her death, which a judge has said makes a manslaughter case 'not weak'

A judge in the case has stated that the murder charge would be difficult to prove because Tostee was not on the balcony at the time of Wright's death, but that a manslaughter case is 'not weak.'
