Grimsby Town may not be known for making Christmas themed adverts, but the Conference club's festive offering certainly rivals promotional clips from the likes of John Lewis.

The advert features lucky Grimsby fan Lloyd Griffith, who is clearly obsessed with his team, replacing pictures of his girlfriend with cut-outs of Mariners striker Lenell John-Lewis.

With the festive period fast approaching, Griffith's girlfriend decides to treat her loved one with a truly memorable present underneath the Christmas tree.

Set to Orphan Boy's 'All Romance Will Fail', the clip then sees the Grimsby superfan led down the stairs before seeing the victim of his affections, John Lewis, sitting beneath the tree with a beaming smile.

The pair embrace as they prepare to spend Christmas morning together before a messages reads: 'Lenell John-Lewis. His name is a shop. Give someone the Christmas they've been dreaming of. Merry Christmas from everyone at Grimsby Town'.

Giffith's will be hoping his team can enjoy a successful Christmas with tough fixtures which see the Mariners face second-placed Macclesfield twice either side of a vist from Lincoln on December 28.

John Lewis will no doubt hoping his Christmas cheer can help continue his form in front of goal as the 25-year-old looks to add to his impressive tally of 12 so far this season.
