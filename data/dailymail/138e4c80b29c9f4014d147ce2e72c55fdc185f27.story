Shakhtar Donetsk will play the 'home' leg of their Champions League last 16 tie with Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.

Except it isn't at home, nor is it even close to home for the Ukrainian champions. 

The match will be played at the Arena Lviv, a colossal 750 miles (1,200km) from their abandoned Donbass Arena, the glistening monument to the team's success now caught up in a warzone.

Seem fanciful? Not if you saw the chilling footage of the Donbass Arena, which less than three years ago witnessed scenes of such joy and celebration at Euro 2012, being shelled by rebel forces back in October.

Security cameras pick up the sound of artillery fire crashing into the exterior of the stadium, then a large panel of glass coming crashing down just inches away from a small child walking past.

The game of football caught up in the cross-fire of conflict. There was simply no way Shakhtar could stay at home - imagine if that shell had struck while a match was taking place.

And, despite the cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia brokered last week by German chancellor Angela Merkel, there seems little realistic hope of Shakhtar's nomadic existence ending soon.

They recently extended their tenancy at Lviv until the end of the year, knowing it is sufficiently out of the way in the west of the country for UEFA to allow them to play their matches on Ukrainian soil.

Not that Bayern are taking any chances this week - they did not travel to Lviv (a flight of just 560 miles from Munich) until Monday afternoon and will return straight after the game.

'It's hard to grasp and it's a unique experience to be playing against a team that is based in a crisis area,' said German striker Thomas Muller.

'Somehow, it's a surreal situation. You know there is this terrible war out there, but you don't really realise it because you don't really know such a situation personally.'

The 34,900-capacity Arena Lviv, home of Karpaty Lviv, is expected to be sold-out but mainly with local who have come to gain a glimpse of the outstanding football played by Pep Guardiola's German champions rather than any assumed loyalty to Shakhtar.

A small knot of devoted fans will take the internal flight from Donetsk to Lviv but the costs of doing this every other week soon add up.

There has been no violence between fans of Shakhtar and Karpaty though some locals have protested at this bigger, brasher, more successful club pitching up to play in their backyard.

But there's no doubt the exile is affecting a team chasing their sixth consecutive Ukrainian league title and seeking to better their previous best in the Champions League, a quarter-final exit to Barcelona in 2010-11.

Their players have been forced to leave their homes and set up camp in Lviv but their results have been better on the road than in their temporary accommodation.

Some of the club's South American players were reluctant to return from their winter training camp in Spain, concerned about the security situation, but they were persuaded to carry on.

'For us, it's a big problem, because we are not playing at home, we are playing away, a new arena,' said Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna.

'You don't have the power like you have at the Donbass Arena. The Donbass Arena is something special - it's our stadium, it's our fans, it's our city.'

Indeed, given these extraordinary circumstances, it is remarkable Mircea Lucescu's team are five points behind Dinamo Kiev and still in with a shout of retaining their league crown.

The prospect of facing Bayern, the runaway Bundesliga leaders who stuffed eight goals past Hamburg at the weekend, is something completely different, however.
