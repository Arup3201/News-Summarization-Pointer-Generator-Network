Painted black and camouflaged 15ft up in a tree, this traffic camera is likely to be spotted by only the most eagle-eyed of drivers.

The trap, which is hidden on a bend in the road by a busy railway station, has caught 1,500 people driving in a bus lane in only one week since it was turned on.

They now face fines of £30, or £60 if not paid in a fortnight – so the local council is making between £45,000 and £90,000 from the camera in just a week.

'Cash cow': Residents say the bus lane camera, marked with an arrow, is hard to see because it is hidden behind a tall tree. Fines totalling up to £90,000 were issued in a single week to motorists who used the lane

The bus-lane camera was put up on a 
stretch of road close to Coventry railway station, where cars have been 
banned. Council officials said it was needed because the road had become
a dangerous ‘rat run’.

But angry locals say the camera is the
sneakiest in Britain and accuse officials of deliberately hiding it to 
make as much money as possible from drivers.

Resident Richard Bradford said the 
hidden camera was a ‘scandal’, adding: ‘This isn’t about road safety, it
is about revenue generation.

Hidden: The camera, which is hard to distinguish from the tree, caught 1,500 motorists using the bus lane in one week

‘This must bring glee to the genius 
who came up with the idea as they [drivers] will all be fined thanks to 
the hidden enforcement camera, tucked away behind a tree.’

Sue Harrower, who works in the area, 
added that the camera ‘must be a real money spinner’, while Geoff Bowers
said: ‘It’s that time when budgets have to be used up and mad plans are
hatched to do so.’ 

But Coventry City Council said the design of the 
camera had been approved by the Department for Transport and was 
‘perfectly legal’.

A spokesman said residents had been warned about the 
camera and that it was put in place for the benefit of those who live in
the area.

The first week of fines followed a 
four-week ‘amnesty’ period after the bus lane opened when drivers 
received warning letters, rather than fines.

Labour councillor Lindsey Harvard 
said: ‘We sent thousands of warning letters to drivers who encroached on
the bus lane. That shows our intention is not to use this as a cash 
cow.

‘The camera has been put in a place where it is not unsightly. Signs are up warning drivers about it.’
