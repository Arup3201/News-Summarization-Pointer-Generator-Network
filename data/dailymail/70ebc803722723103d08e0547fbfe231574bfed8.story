Rev Margaret McPhee (pictured) claimed that Santa was 'make believe and not real' to a group of children at a carol concert in Stalham, Norfolk

When a curate asked primary school children at an end-of-term service what Christmas was about, she should have guessed what was coming.

But after several excitedly called out ‘Father Christmas’, Rev Margaret McPhee stunned them by claiming the jolly chap in the red suit didn’t exist.

She apologised for the comment immediately after the service but outraged parents are now threatening to boycott her village church, St Mary’s in Stalham, Norfolk, for ruining the magic of the season.

Some have even tried to undo the damage by telling their children the married assistant priest is a ‘liar’.

Furious messages posted on the internet include one from Colin and Clare Jefkins, who said: ‘Sorry my child will not attend any more church services again.

‘She would not like it if we said there was no “God”.’ Michelle Ryan added: ‘Rev McPhee has put me off taking my children to church just in case something else gets said.’

Tara Fiske wrote that both her children believe, saying: ‘They grow up far too quickly already, people shouldn’t try to make them grow up faster!!!! I had to tell my children that the vicar was a liar basically, so I could keep my children believing.’

Peppa Cuthbert complained future Christmas services had been ‘tainted’ by the outburst. ‘I think a lot of people probably felt like walking out but out of respect for the children sat in shock at what was said,’ she said.

And Samantha Tisshaw described how her confused seven-year-old son asked her: ‘Mum, why did Reverend Margaret lie to us?’

The Church of England service was held on Monday for the pupils of Stalham Academy Primary School, which has 340 children aged seven to 11. 

The choir had just finished singing when Mrs McPhee, 49, asked the fateful question about the meaning of Christmas. When some children mentioned Santa Claus, she claimed he was ‘make-believe and not real’.

The comments prompted an urgent damage limitation exercise from the wife of Stalham rector Simon Lawrence, who offered an ‘unreserved’ apology.

Emma Lawrence said: ‘As Simon has said to those parents who have phoned or emailed us, it was a stupid, unplanned, off-the-cuff remark which Margaret is very sorry for.’ 

Mrs McPhee, who was previously a business lecturer at the University of East Anglia, confessed to making a ‘huge mistake’.

‘I really regret it and the upset it has caused to those who were there and whoever has since heard about it,’ she said.

Norwich Diocese described Mrs McPhee as a ‘sensitive and sensible priest’.

Spokesman Jan McFarlane said: ‘She knew she should not have said what she said as soon as she said it and she is trying to do everything possible to put it right.’

Valerie Moore, chief executive at the Right for Success Trust, which runs the 341-pupil school, said that she had no control over what the vicar was going to say.

Miss Moore said: 'The children were astonished, which is very sad. However, the vicar made a heartfelt apology to us all.

'I don't like to apportion blame.

'I love the fact the curate took the time to understand what had happened, understand she had upset people and put it right.

'The school has a fantastic relationship with the church and we would like that to continue.' 

Civil servants are being urged not to use the phrase ‘Merry Christmas’ in festive messages.

An email to Government staff suggested ‘Season’s Greetings’ was a more acceptable term. Officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change were also advised not to use ‘images of skin’.

The message was sent to some members of staff who wanted to know how best to compose messages in the run-up to Christmas. It stated: ‘When picking, think Season’s Greetings rather than Merry Christmas.’ 

The email went on: ‘As an organisation of multiple faiths and agnostics serving the same and in the interest of inclusion, I’d avoid images of skin.’

A DECC spokesman insisted the email was only sent to a small number of staff. He said: ‘There is no formal guidance about Christmas cards,’ adding that Energy Secretary Ed Davey’s email to staff featured repeated use of the word Christmas.

Tory MP Ian Liddel-Grainger called the advice ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘We should be able to celebrate Christmas and recognise people have different faiths without offending anyone.’

Controversy: Father Dennis Higgins (pictured) angered parents by telling children at a mass in Derbyshire that Father Christmas did not exist

It is not the first time a vicar has been criticised for claiming that Santa is not real.

Earlier this month, Father Dennis Higgins was labelled ‘plain mean’ after telling a group of schoolchildren that Father Christmas did not exist.

The clergyman, who is in his 80s, was attempting to teach pupils the true meaning of Christmas while delivering mass at a school in Buxton, Derbyshire.

His comments angered parents, who accused him of ruining the 'magic of Christmas'.

One parent, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'How dare he say such things to such young children?

'To try and take away the magic of Christmas is just plain mean.

'It really saddens me that someone who people should respect and look up to can do something so mean.'

However, members of the priest’s congregation quickly leapt to his defence, setting up a Facebook page called Support Father Higgins and posting a series of kind messages calling him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man.

His support page reads: 'This page is being set up on behalf of Father Dennis Higgins who has dedicated his life to God and the Church. He has been a pillar of Buxton's community.' 

Father Andrew Cole, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Nottingham, which includes Buxton and the surrounding area, later apologised for Father Higgins' 'intemperate language'.
