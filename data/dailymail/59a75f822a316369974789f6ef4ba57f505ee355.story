The lavatory at a rural museum has become a tourist attraction in its own right because of the way it leans at an extraordinary angle.

Tourist have been flocking to the Museum of Steam Power and Land Drainage in Westonzoyland, Somerset, to take pictures of themselves using the listing loo.

Dubbed the 'Leaning Tower Of Pee-sa', the small redbrick privy leans at an angle just like its Italian counterpart, and often attract queues as visitors take hilarious pictures of each other at the listed building.

The station attendant's loo leans against the museum as demonstrated by museum helper Alan Davies, 58

Unlike the famed Italian tower, however, visitors are - in both senses - allowed to go inside.

Giving
new meaning to the phrase 'listed building', the outdoor toilet at Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum was built
around 1940 for the use of the pumping station attendant.

Due to soft ground and poor foundations, it began to 
develop a lean soon after completion, and now reclines against the neighbouring museum building.

The angular outhouse was spotted by keen-eyed Rod Morris, who said: 'It made me smile.

'The toilet block is leaning on the wall of a larger building - in much the same way a drunk would lean on a toilet wall.'

Jason Keswick, membership secretary for the Westonzoyland Engine Trust, said: 'Nobody knows how long exactly it has been leaning for.

'The toilet was built in the 1940s, before then there was just a wooden plank over the river.

'It was built on a level but over the years it has sunk on one side and leans against a building now so it can't move any more.

'The toilet is certainly a talking point for visitors, and it is very popular for people who take photos of it.

'It certainly brings a new meaning to
the term 'listed building' and it is still functional but we are 
building a new block of toilets and it will just be an exhibit.'

The museum, near Bridgwater, in 
Somerset, is home to the county's oldest steam-powered pumping station, 
which was once used to drain the Somerset Levels.

The main attraction is the 1861 steam
engine and pump - the only one in the country still in its original 
position and in working order.Â  The museum also has a number of steam 
engines and pumps, as well as a short length of narrow-gauge railway.

The mechanical pumping station was built in 1830 to drain the waterlogged 'Levels' around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy, and Othery.

Its drainage system proved such a success that further pumping stations were built in the area to do the same job.

A cottage was built next door to the 
pumping station, to provide accommodation for the pumping attendant, and
later on the outdoor lavatory.

The pump operated until 1951, by which time it had become redundant because of other, more modern, drainage methods. Now the pump house is Grade II-listed.
