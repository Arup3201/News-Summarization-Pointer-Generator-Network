A driver has been reversing his car along India's roads since 2003 when the vehicle got stuck in a backwards gear and he couldn't afford to repair it.

Harpreet Devi, 33, eventually managed to gather the cash together to fix his car, but he was so used to driving it backwards that he had three more reverse gears fitted.

Now Harpeet travels around by reversing his specially modified Fiat at speeds of up to 50mph, as he insist he feels safer going backwards than forwards.

Harpeet, 33, started driving backwards when his car broke in a reverse gear and he couldn't afford to fix it

His car has a redesigned gearbox that allows him to have four reverse gears and one forward gear. He has even fitted an ambulance siren to alert other drivers and pedestrians - and added headlights to the rear of his car.

Harpeet from Bhatinda, in the Indian province of Punjab, explained: 'One day I had trouble when my car wasn't working properly. It had got stuck in the backwards gear.

'I got out from the city and there was no money in my pockets so I tried driving the car backwards and got all the way home.'

At the time the car broke, Harpeet was unable to get it repaired immediately and had to drive home constantly looking through the rearview mirror.

Harpreet has now been given special permission by the state government to drive legally in reverse and practises his reverse driving up to three times a week.

In 2005, Harpreet drove in reverse from the Indian state of Rajasthan to Lahore in Pakistan to promote peace between the two countries.

But after 11 years of driving backwards, he has begun to suffer severe neck and back problems from constantly looking over his shoulder.
