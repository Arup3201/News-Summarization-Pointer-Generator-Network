A husband and wife from Scotland say their dream cruise to the Mediterranean became a disaster when they were confined to their cabin due to severe illness.

Robert Clements, from Saltcoats in North Ayrshire, said he experienced gastric symptoms, including diarrhoea, stomach cramps and spasms, while travelling on board the Thomson Spirit cruise ship in April 2014.

He and his 71-year-old wife, Rona, booked the two-week tour of the Mediterranean to celebrate his 67th birthday and see Rome’s Colosseum, but were unable to disembark when they arrived at the Italian capital.

The Clements, who are grandparents of five, visited the cruise ship’s doctor, who they say diagnosed Robert with ‘severe gastroenteritis’.

They said they were confined to their cabin for 48 hours due to his illness and were unable to get off the ship to visit the Colosseum on Robert’s birthday.

The retired couple has hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate the conditions on the ship.

Robert said on occasion it seemed to them that some of the food on the ship had been served lukewarm and one particular occasion some of the chicken they ate ‘had not been cooked properly’ and had an unusual taste.

He continues to suffer from illness and has had to alter his diet because of ongoing symptoms.

He said: ‘I feel very disappointed that I could not celebrate my birthday properly or as planned. ‘The whole trip was ruined by the pain and discomfort I have suffered.

‘Having to stay in my cabin whilst being so close to the Colosseum of Rome – a wonder of the world – was a truly terrible and disappointing experience.’

Irwin Mitchell said it continues to investigate claims from 12 people who said they suffered similar symptoms while travelling on board the Thomson Spirit in 2013.

It is the oldest member of Thomson’s fleet, and the tour operator says it is still a ‘firm favourite with customers thanks to its warm, home-from-home atmosphere.’

The cruise ship boasts three restaurants, five bars, two lounges, a nightclub, casino and two swimming pools for guests.

Jennifer Downing, a travel law expert from Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Gastroenteritis can cause huge discomfort and very unpleasant symptoms. ‘We are now looking into the conditions on the ship in order to establish why Robert developed gastric illness.

‘We are concerned at the couple’s reports that other passengers fell ill and we hope that Thomson will assist in our investigations and work with us to help provide the answers our clients are desperately seeking.’

In a statement, Thomson said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr and Mrs Clements’ experience on board Thomson Spirit.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.

'The ultimate priority for Thomson Cruises is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers. We operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards.'
