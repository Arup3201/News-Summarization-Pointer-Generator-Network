A heartbroken couple fear they may never be able to return to their home after a massive sink hole threatened to swallow it up.

Two other houses also had to be evacuated after the massive 25ft-wide crater opened up in the street.

Peter Cunningham and his wife Susan returned to their property as fears grew that part of the structure could collapse.

The area around the property in 
Magdalen's Road, Ripon, North Yorkshire, was cordoned off as engineers 
prepared to check on the property's safety.

Torn apart: A view of one of three properties which had to evacuated after a sinkhole opened up in a Yorkshire street, the latest in a series of ground collapses recently

Emergency response: A huge crack can be seen down the side of this property in Ripon as a result of the sinkhole, prompting police to cordon off the area

Emergency services were alerted 
yesterday evening after Mr Cunningham, 61, returned home to find a crack
 in the wall of the detached house.

He said: 'I got home and put the key into the back door but the door wouldn't open. 

'I thought it was weird and then I noticed a crack in the patio and when I looked up the house wall was cracked as well.'

The couple believe the danger is so great that they may never be able to set foot back in their home again.

Mrs Cunningham, 60, said: 'We are heartbroken.' 

Terrifying: The sinkhole has undermined the foundations and caused the partial collapse of the house

Risk: The British Geological Survey has said that the most susceptible area in the UK for sinkholes is the Permian gypsum deposits of north-east England, particularly around Ripon, where this house is located

No-one
 has been hurt in the incident which is believed to have been caused by a
 sink hole, the sixth such incident in Britain in recent weeks.

A North Yorkshire Fire Service spokeswoman said a dog was rescued from cracks in the property by fire crews. 

The
 hole appeared just days after a proposal to build 75 homes on nearby 
abandoned auction mart site was rejected by councillors due to 
subsidence fears. 

Planning officers at Harrogate Borough Council had recommended approval for the scheme by Ripon Property Developments.

But the Mayor of Ripon, Councillor Mick 
Stanley, urged members to reject the plans because of the risk of gypsum
 subsidence causing ground instability.

He said: 'My main 
concern is the stability. I urge you to throw out this application as 
there is insufficient evidence that development can be safe.

'Why has there been no development on the site for the past 300 years? Could it be that our ancestors knew it was unstable?

'I
 don't think any development should take place on that site because it 
is unsafe for building. I don't think any insurer is going to insure any
 of those houses built at that site.'

The
 British Geological Survey has said that Ripon is one of the most 
susceptible areas in the UK for sinkholes because of the gypsum deposits
 there. 

It says large sinkholes have developed around Ripon, some of which have affected property and infrastructure.

'Weird': Peter Cunningham said he only noticed the huge crack down the side of his house when he couldn't get his back door to open

Assessing the damage: Officials look over a neighbouring wall near the properties which have been evacuated

Alert: One of the neighbouring houses which was one of three properties evacuated by police while engineers inspected the damage caused by the sinkhole in the area

Hidden danger: A graphic explaining why some areas are more susceptible to sinkholes than others

This is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone, and thus dissolves more rapidly. 

Magdelen's Road is just a few hundred yards from Ure Bank Terrace, where a massive sink hole appeared in 1997.

That
 hole which had been known about since Victorian times was said to have 
been the inspiration for the illustrations in Lewis Carroll's Alice in 
Wonderland.

The young girl 
used as the model for the drawings used to live in a house across the 
River Ure from where the latest sink hole has appeared. 

Meanwhile, two more sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the M2 motorway in Kent, local resident Colin Parsons said.

Recurring theme: These two sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the M2 motorway in Kent last week

The two holes opened up in the past three weeks about 500 yards apart on farmland between Sittingbourne and Faversham.

One sinkhole is about 9ft deep and the other about 10ft deep. Highways contractor Mr Parsons, 55, said: 'One of them looks like a giant footprint.

'The first one appeared three weeks ago. As I was walking with my wife, we went to look at another spot where one had opened up before and, sure enough, another one was there.

'The interesting aspect to this is that these have appeared about a mile from the M2 where one occurred, and they will keep opening up.'

Sinkholes are an 'ongoing feature of the landscape' and the country is likely to see more as the ground is set to remain saturated for some time, according to a geology expert.

The that opened up beneath a 100-year-old detached house in Magdalen's Close in Ripon, North Yorkshire, yesterday, was the latest in a spate of sinkholes.

It came after a 35ft (10.7m) wide and 20ft (6.1m) deep one opened up under homes in a quiet cul-de-sac in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on Saturday morning.

Dangerous: A 50ft-deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the M2 in north Kent last week

And last week a stretch of the M2 in north Kent was closed after a 15ft (4.6m) deep hole was discovered in the central reservation, while on February 2 a teenager's car was swallowed up when a 30ft (9.1m) deep crater appeared in a family's driveway in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

A range of factors - natural and man-induced - can trigger sinkhole collapse, and heavy rain or surface flooding are considered to be examples of triggers.

Leaking drainage pipes, burst water mains, irrigation, or even the act of emptying a swimming pool, are also examples. 

Vanessa Banks, from the British Geological Survey, said: 'The ground is saturated at the moment, in certain parts of the country, and where it's saturated, it will remain saturated for some weeks, if not months.

'And gradually the situation will improve, but in the short term I suspect there will be more of these incidents being reported.'

Brand new: Zoe Smith, 19, was given a replacement after the car was engulfed by the hole which developed outside her home

Ms Banks said that while there has been a spate of sinkholes this month, she remembers a similar spate around 1987 when she was working in Norwich - during a period which was also 'very wet'.

'You may or may not have seen that a bus actually sunk into one of these cavities,' she said.

Ms Banks said she fears that increased knowledge about sinkholes is worrying people.

'I fear that people are becoming worried because we're increasing their awareness of the occurrence of these things. These cavities have existed for as long as we have been developing. They pre-date humans,' she said.

Ms Banks said sinkholes are known about and so there are guidelines for building and construction to prevent building on areas of land where there may be problems in the ground.

'We try to avoid them during construction, or we take adequate measures to stabilise them,' she said.

Risk: Gretel Davidson feared she would have to pay around £10,000 after a sinkhole twice the height of a double-decker bus appeared in her garden in Banehurst, South-East London

Concern: A 35ft wide hole appeared underneath a home in Hemel Hempstead last week, prompting the surrounding properties to be evacuated

Ms Banks said it is necessary that people are aware of potential sinkholes so that they can 'manage the situation around them'.'We know they're an ongoing feature of the landscape,' she said.

And she added: 'There is definitely a direct link between the infiltration of surface water and the likelihood of these occurring.'

Looking ahead, Ms Banks said: 'I think we will see some more incidents over the coming months. I think we will have some reported to us here.'They may not be of the scale that hit the headlines.'

The British Geological Survey has said that the most susceptible area in the UK for sinkholes is the Permian gypsum deposits of north-east England, particularly around Ripon.

It says large sinkholes have developed around Ripon, some of which have affected property and infrastructure. This is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone, and thus dissolves more rapidly.

And local residents said there was a long-standing problem with gypsum-related subsidence in the area which had caused other homes to collapse over the years.
