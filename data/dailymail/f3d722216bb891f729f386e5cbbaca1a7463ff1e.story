Cats named Coco and dogs named Max are the most likely to be rehomed.

Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, which cared for around 9,000 animals last year, today released a list of the five unluckiest names based on the unwanted pets they have cared for.

The unluckiest dog names are Max, Charlie, Buster, Bailey and Alfie, while the cat names are Coco, Tigger, Princess, Daisy and Frankie.

Cats named Coco, like this feline pictured with Battersea Dogs and Cats Home worker Claire Eaglestone, are the most likely to need to get rehomed, along with dogs named Max

Battersea currently has four cats called Coco and two called Tigger, four dogs called Buster and two called Max.

Coco, aged nine, is just one example of a cat the centre has to look after, due to the previous owner no longer been able to care for her.

Carly Whyborn, Batterseaâ€™s head of operations, said there are certain names which 'seem to be more unlucky for pets'.

She said: 'The top five names in each category are lovely but seem to be more common in our three centres in London, Brands Hatch and Old Windsor.

Cats named Princess, like this multi-coloured moggy, are regularly taken in by the shelter

Dogs named Alfie, like this pooch, and those called Max, Charlie, Buster, Bailey are the most often taken in by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

'Battersea cares for all these homeless dogs and cats, regardless of their name, and hopes animal lovers will give a second chance to all the unwanted Busters, Charlies and Cocos out there.'

The shelter also revealed that the most common dog breed they took in was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the average age of animals arriving was one year and one month old for cats and nine months for dogs.
