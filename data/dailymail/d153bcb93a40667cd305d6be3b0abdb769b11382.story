It's one of the last places you might expect to find one - but this man did.

While out in his back yard, Alaska resident George Pierce stumbled on the remains of unusual visitor - a garter snake

Mr Pierce, from Kasilof, found the frozen, 1.5ft-long reptile out in the snow while feeding his dogs last Saturday.

He was understandably baffled at how a slightly venomous snake that's normally found in much warmer climes could be so far north.

Mr Pierce said: 'It's an odd thing to find here especially this time of year. Like it fell out of the sky. Not something you see every day.'

The find, however, is not as far-fetched in Alaska as some might think, Alaska Fish and Game Wildlife biologist Jeff Selinger told the Anchorage Daily News.

The common garter snake is the only species of snake found in Alaska, he said. It can be found as far up as northern Canada, he said, and as far south as South America.

No snakes have been recorded living in the wild in the Kenai Peninsula, according to Selinger. But he added that it doesn't mean people can't have them as indoor pets.

One of two pet stores in the central peninsula went out of business last March. The only other pet store in the area is a Petco, which does not have any garter snakes in stock, according to a worker there.

Pierce lives a block away from Tustemena Elementary School, the Anchorage Daily News reported. He wondered if the snake escaped from a classroom show-and-tell. Or maybe it arrived through transport from outside the state.

No pet snakes have been reported missing from the nearby school, according to principal Doug Hayman.

Another possibility is that the snake arrived in Alaska by cargo ship, Selinger said. The snakes live off frogs and insects, he said.

'It is not out of the question one could survive here, but our harsh climate makes it difficult in the winter,' he said.

The above-average temperatures in the area might have been warm enough for the snake to survive outside, but Pierce said the reptile might have been run over by his snow blower, based on a nick on the end of its tail.
