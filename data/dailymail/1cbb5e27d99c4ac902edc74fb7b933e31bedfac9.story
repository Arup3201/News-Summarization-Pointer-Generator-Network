Gardeners have been rubbing their hands for weeks at the prospect of bumper harvests of everything from carrots to courgettes after the long, hot summer.

But a hotel in Somerset is about to clean-up with what it is expected to be its biggest ever crop - of loofahs.

Contrary to popular belief, the back 
scrubbers, which are popular in bathrooms up and down the country, are 
not related to sea sponges at all.

Myth: Contrary to popular belief, loofahs are a type of gourd grown in the tropics, not a sea sponge

Unpalatable: While loofahs are edible, they are tough, which is why they make a better bath-time implement

Finished article: Once loofahs have been dried the leave the fibrous husk that make such good scrubbers

They are actually a type of gourd related to the cucumber that are grown in the steamy tropics of South East Asia, where they are just as likely to be found adorning the dinner table as they are hanging above the bath tub.

Ston Easton Park Hotel has been growing Britain's only crop for the past five years at its 32-acre home, which is located - naturally - just outside Bath.

Plant your loofah seeds in pots in a warm environment in early spring and wait for them to germinate.

Once the seeds have sprouted, transfer the plants to the greenhouse.

Loofahs, which grow on vines, will largely take care of themselves.

As they mature their skins will become tough and rubbery. They will be less tasty to eat, but will make a better bathroom implement.

Once they have matured, pick the loofahs, peel off their skins and remove the seeds. Try to squeeze out as much of the flesh as possible.

Leave the fibrous husk in the sun to dry. After about a week your loofah will be ready to be moved to the bathroom.

Such has been this year's success with weather that has brought the wasps out in their droves, the hotel will be holding a Loofah Festival next month.

Head gardener Steve Hargreaves added: 'This year they're bigger than ever. We've had a few whopping big loofah well over 15 inches long.

'They are from the same family as 
cucumbers, but they're different. You can eat them when they are young, 
but I haven't dared to give it a go yet.'

Vegetable gardener Dale Toten added: 'They're actually not that tough to grow, but they are tough to eat.

'We start them in pots in February before planting them in the greenhouse in May.

'They're
kind of like growing tomatoes. Once you've got them out of the pots and
planted up they pretty much look after themselves.'

Loofahs are fibrous vegetables with dark green skin that get increasingly tough and rubbery with age.

The mature fruits are harvested and 
left to dry until all the soft flesh has gone, leaving only a network of
fibres which become the familiar bathroom sight.

They are eaten in their native South East Asia and also commonly used in bathing.

Unique: Ston Easton Park Hotel has been growing Britain's only loofah crop for the past five years on its estate

Harvest: This year's heat wave has provided the perfect growing conditions for Ston Easton's loofahs

Guests of the hotel are spoiled with their very own loofahs, which are grown on the estate.

Mr Hargreaves said: 'Once we've peeled off the skins and emptied out the seeds we wash them and squeeze out as much flesh as possible.

'They're quite slimy. They feel like they're full of soap.

'Once they have been thoroughly cleaned, we hang them up for a week or two, and then bang - you have yourself a loofah.'
