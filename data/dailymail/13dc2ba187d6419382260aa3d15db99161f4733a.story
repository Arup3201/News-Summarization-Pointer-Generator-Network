When former Jimmy Choo boss Tamara Mellon announced that she was launching her own collection, the fashion world expected big things.

And the designer, who sold her shares in the luxury shoe business in 2011 for £82.5 million, didn't disappoint.

Mellon has unveiled a debut collection of ready-to-wear clothing and shoes - including a pair of £1,595 leather legging boots - and she's called on supermodel Karlie Kloss to model them.

Recognise her? Karlie Kloss rocks a far more edgy look in the campaign video for Tamara Mellon's new collection

21-year-old Kloss, who is ranked the seventh top model in the world by Models.com, is the star of Mellon's new campaign, High Heels, Sharp Knives.

In a newly-released campaign video, Kloss can be seen donning the legging boots as she struts around an apartment playing a femme fatale carrying a knife and washing what looks like blood from her hands before getting up close and personal with another female.

In the short film, shot by Rie Rasmussen, the Victoria’s Secret Angel works red lips and heavy eye make-up as she poses in Mellon's slinky designs and killer red stilettos.

Thigh's the limit! Karlie, who is one of the world's most successful models right now, rocks the £1,595 leather legging boots in the video

Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge

Mellon describes her leather creation, as sported by Kloss, as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging. You can wear a sweater over it or a big man's shirt and there's no gap.'

Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette, each size of this unique style is constructed with either a XS/S or M/L pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take.'

The capsule collection also includes a £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 fringed wrap-effect leather skirt.

Kloss, who recently strutted her stuff in the annual Victoria's Secret show, has quickly become one of the most famous faces in fashion - walking in 64 fashion shows in a single season.

She has also starred in campaigns such as Juicy Couture, Elie Saab, and Jean Paul Gaultier

Mellon's debut range comes soon after she told how her business 
partner, Jimmy Choo, did not design a single shoe for the multi-million 
dollar brand named after him.

During an interview this morning on the Today
 show, the 46-year-old revealed that she never received a sketch from 
him during the years they worked together; 'Not one,' she declared. 

Unaware
 of Mr Choo's lack of design nous when they joined forces, she said that
 she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion 
writing days as accessories editor at Vogue to guide her.

Daring: Mellon (L) describes her leather creation (R), which is a far cry from a dainty Choo, as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging'

Design process: Ms Mellon said that she would 
come up with ideas and Mr Choo's niece, Ms Choi would sketch them out 
and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration

Ms Mellon said from 
there her relationship with Mr Choo deteriorated to the point that any  
conversation was 'out of the question'.

Eventually, after much confrontation, Mr Choo sold his share in the company in 2001.

Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label.

Stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants, £550

Wool-blend pencil skirt, £460

Heaven leopard-print calf hair and elaphe pumps, £595

Chill Out metallic leather sandals, £325

Fringed wrap-effect leather skirt
£830

Stretch-wool piqué blazer, £740
