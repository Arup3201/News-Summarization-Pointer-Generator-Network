John Wisniewski, the liberal state assemblyman leading the charge against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of his George Washington Bridge traffic scandal, announced Monday that he has formed a new special investigative committee to issue subpoenas and press for more answers.

Just hours later, Wisniewski asked a prosecutor 
to bring criminal charges against a major figure in the 'Bridgegate' 
mess who refused to answer questions in a January 9 hearing where he 
appeared under subpoena.

WIsniewski asked for a misdemeanor contempt prosecution of David Wildstein, a Port Authority official and childhood acquaintance of the governor who resigned in December. Wildstein cited his constitutional right against 
self-incrimination during 
the Jan. 9 hearing. Minutes later, the transportation committee voted to
 hold him in contempt.

In a letter to Mercer County, N.J. 
Prosecutor Joseph Bocchini, Jr., Wisniewski wrote Monday that his committee 
'unanimously believes that Mr. Wildstein’s obfuscation of our 
investigation rises to the level of [criminal] contempt under existing state 
statutes.'

In a press conference earlier, New Jersey General Assembly Speaker-Elect Vincent Prieto called the newly anointed legislative body a 'super investigatory committee' organized to expand the existing work of the transportation committee, chaired by Wisniewski.

'This has become more than a transportation issue,' Prieto said. 'We've now gone beyond that.'

'Our concern is that there was a blatant abuse of power,' Wisniewski told reporters on Monday. 'It's not sufficient to fire some people.' Christie has dismissed at least two officials implicated in the case.

Unstoppable force meets immovable object? Chris Christie has boasted that he works well with Democrats in his state legislature, but that cooperation is about to come to a screeching halt

David Wildstein refused to testify before Assemblyman John Wisniewski's transportation committee on Jan. 9, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, but assembly democrats voted to hold him in contempt -- and now Wisniewski has asked a prosecutor to charge him with a crime

The two aides Gov. Christie dismissed
 last week, former Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and former 
Campaign Director Bill Stepien, will receive the new bipartisan 
committee's first two subpoenas, he said.

Emails
 collected by Wisniewski's transportation panel implicated both in a 
plot to exact political retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. 
by closing several of his town's entry lanes to the George Washington 
Bridge, snarling traffic for four days in September.

Christie
 has forcefully denied knowing anything about the plan, even as his 
confidantes and political appointees tumble around him.

The new committee will officially convene on Thursday in a special legislative session.

Wisniewski said Monday morning in a statement that evidence he has collected to date 'makes clear that this now goes ... into the highest ranks of the executive branch.'

'This investigation will continue with increased intensity,' he said. That effort, he told reporters, will require 'more severe' allocation of staff and funding.

Wisniewski's rhetoric has also grown in intensity since last week. In an interview Thursday with MailOnline, he hedged on the idea of launching a bid to impeach Christie, calling it 'premature' and 'not the way to go right now.'

But appearing Sunday on the CBS program 'Face The Nation,' he seemed ready to go down that politically fraught road.

'If it becomes known that the governor was involved and he knew about it and he knew about the cover-up, and he was approving the actions taken by his senior staff, that raises serious questions that the assembly ought to look at,' Wisniewski said.

'And that ought to be considered in light of what our responsibility is. The Assembly has the ability to do articles of impeachment.'

Former Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly (L) and former Campaign Manager Bill Stepien (R, looking at Christie) were shown the door on Wednesday and will likely see subpoenas this week

In addition to having subpoena power, the new committee will have the full-time services of a special counsel, Prieto said,

In New Jersey, a 'special counsel' is the equivalent of a 'special prosecutor' in the federal government, according to a Republican legal expert in the Garden State who spoke with MailOnline.

'You have a a lawyer recruited from outside the government and trusted with the authority to investigate, subpoena witnesses, and even seek indictments,' he said.

Prieto, the incoming assembly speaker, told reporters Monday that 'seeking outside counsel is very important in case there's other outside agencies that are going to be involved in this.'

A general assembly clerk reached in Trenton would not speculate about how fast the committee would do its job, or how soon Kelly and Stepien might testify.

In a transportation committee hearing on Thursday, former New York New Jersey Port Authority official David Wildstein refused to answer Wisniewski's questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

A raft of emails released by the committee a day later showed that Port Authority officials knew within hours of the bridge lanes' closure that public safety was at risk. Yet the traffic pattern entering the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee remained unchanged for four days.

Christie faces new pressure to explain what knowledge, if any, he had of the scheme before it was carried out. He is thought to be a likely 2016 presidential candidate.

Wisniewski's renewed investigation is one of three now targeting the brash, outspoken Garden State governor.

U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, whom President Barack Obama appointed to fill the office that Christie left for the governor's mansion, is probing the 'Bridgegate' controversy. Fishman has already attracted barbs from conservatives for his history of making large donations to Democratic political candidates, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.

And an inspector general in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating whether Christie's administration broke federal law when it awarded disaster relief funds following Superstorm Sandy to a firm that produced tourism commercials.

The 'Stronger Than The Storm' ads, produced by East Rutherford, N.J.-based MWW and a subcontractor, cost $4.7 million to make – and included cameos by the governor, his wife and three of their children.

Another firm offered to produce the ad campaign for $2.5 million, but its scripts did not include the Christies. The ads ran in the weeks leading up to the governor's November 2013 re-election.
