Actor Freddie Smith, of Days of Our Lives fame, has pleaded guilty to multiple charges stemming from the car crash that seriously injured his girlfriend in northeast Ohio in October.

The 26-year-old soap opera star from Los Angeles lost control of a vehicle October 7 in Ashtabula  County. On Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to felony vehicular assault and misdemeanor driving under the influence.

Smith told a judge he fell asleep because he'd been drinking. His blood-alcohol level was .093, above Ohio's legal limit of .08, at the time of the crash.

Smith's girlfriend, Alyssa Tabit, 27, of North Hollywood, was badly hurt in the wreck but is recovering. They had returned to Smith's hometown for a wedding.

Smith's attorney said Wednesday that Smith acknowledged in court that he had made a terrible mistake.

Judging by recent social media posts, Smith and Tabit appear to be still together. 

A statement from the State Highway Patrol released after the crash said the 26-year-old Smith 'failed to safely negotiate a left curve and lost control.

'It crossed the centerline, traveled off the left side of the road and struck a culvert.'

The car the flipped over, trapping Tabit inside. Paramedics who arrived on the scene had to extract the injured woman, who was then flown to a Youngstown hospital in critical condition.

Smith, an Ohio native whose family still live in Ashtabula County, remains free on $5,000 bail. 

The 26-year-old could face up to two years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for February 18. 

Smith is best known for his role as the openly gay character Sonny Kiriakis on the long-running soap opera Days of Our Lives.
