Despite the huge pressure upon women in the spotlight to appear youthful until well into middle age, it seems Jennifer Aniston is fervently against plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures after seeing the effects on the faces of her celebrity friends.

The former Friends actress, 45, who is rumoured to be tying the knot with fiancé Justin Theroux soon, has spoken out against the expectation that women in Hollywood be ‘ageless’ and says she has learned from the mistakes of others when it comes to surgery.

Speaking to Yahoo! Beauty, Jen said: ‘I think what I have been witness to is seeing women trying to stay ageless with what they are doing to themselves. I am grateful to learn from their mistakes because I am not injecting s**t into my face.’

The 45-year-old actress said that when she sees other women who have had surgeries her 'heart breaks'

‘Honestly I see them and my heart breaks. I think “Oh god, if you only knew how much older you look."

‘They are trying to stop the clock and all you see is an insecure person who won’t let themselves just age.

'Sometimes I wish I could beg the people i know, who I am very near and dear to, to not touch their face.'

Jennifer, who has talked openly in the past about having surgery on her nose to correct a deviated septum, also spoke about her fiancé Justin.

Jennifer said that fiance Justin Theroux would 'put a gun to her head' if she altered her face with injections

Usually fiercely private about her relationships, Jen admitted that her other half is part of the reason she shuns cosmetic procedures: ‘I also have a fiancé who will put a gun to my head if I touch my face in anyway.’

Her comments are likely to ruffle a few feathers amongst even her closest friends.

Best friend Courtney Cox has admitted being 'game for anything' when it comes to cosmetic procedures and being a 'big believer' in laser treatments.
