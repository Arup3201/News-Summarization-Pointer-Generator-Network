'I don't think that people can already compare us with Spain. They won three titles in a row,' Lahm told Sport Bild.

'Only when Germany can achieve something similar can we say that Germany are the new benchmark.

'For me, Spain remain the team to beat at the moment and also at Euro 2016.'

Still top? Lahm claims 2010 World Champions Spain are still the team to beat and will be a threat at Euro 2016

The Bayern Munich defender reflected on Germany's performances over the past decade and claimed the catalyst was their dismal Euro 2004 campaign.

'Germany have gone through a lot to get here. I still remember the group-stage elimination at Euro 2004, which was a huge disappointment.

'We learned a lot, though, and developed as a team in the following years. There was the semi-final at the 2006 World Cup, the final at Euro 2008 and semi-finals at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.
