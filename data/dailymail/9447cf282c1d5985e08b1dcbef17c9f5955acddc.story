A teenager who went out clubbing in Manchester with his mates woke up in Paris the following morning after booking a flight in the early hours.

Luke Harding was getting a cab home from the Tokyo Project nightclub, nicknamed Tokes, in Oldham when he found his passport in his pocket and drunkenly decided to visit the Eiffel Tower.

Mr Harding, a sheet metal worker, asked the shocked taxi driver to head immediately for Manchester Airport then booked a last minute 6am flight for £100 through Flybe to the French capital using his mobile phone.

Good night out? Luke Harding took a picture of himself in front of the Arc de Triomphe after he ended up in Paris following a night out in Oldham, Manchester

The 19-year-old eventually woke up in a toilet cubicle at Charles De Gaulle Airport - 500 miles from where he started his night to remember.

Pals nursing a giant hangover from a night out at the club were stunned to see a sheepish Luke had tweeted a picture of himself standing next to the Eiffel Tower and then another with the caption: 'Sat outside the Arc De Triumph (sic) eating a croissant.'

News of his unexpected excursion spread like wildfire around the social media site with many messages poking fun at the travelling teenager.

In a series of tweets from Paris, Luke said: 'Only woke up in the toilets of Charles de Gaulle airport an hour ago and half of Oldham know haha.'

He added: 'I got in a taxi to Manchester airport and booked a flight on my phone! Don’t remember the flight. It’s f***ing expensive here though. Mum thinks I’m a pillock. Walked past the Eiffel Tower 3 times! Not a clue where I am!'

He was eventually picked up 12 hours later at Manchester by friends when he had to pay out a further £170 to get a flight back to the UK. The entire escapade cost him a total of £300.

Just going for one drink... Luke says he went for a quick pint at the Tokyo Project, Oldham, with a mate after work but ended up travelling hundreds of miles when he drunkenly booked a flight to France

In further tweets Mr Harding, who had been using his passport as ID to drink at the nightclub, added: 'My flight home wasn’t till 7.30 at night I had to stay in Paris! Plus spent all that money to get there be a waste not to stay. My mates didn’t believe me! Bizarre thing to do going Paris but it happened.

'Always out in Manchester won’t be taking my f..king passport that’s for sure.'

Speaking today, he said: 'It all started off just going for a pint after work with one of my mates, one thing lead to another and we decide we are going to go out to Tokyo’s in Oldham.

'It turned out to be just a bog standard night and we started to get a bit bored and decide to call it quits and head off home. The only thing was by this time we are well and truly plastered.

Trip: Luke Harding decided to go to Paris after a night out in Oldham, Manchester

'I went to drop my friend off at his house in a taxi but for some reason I randomly decided that I don’t want to go home but stay out instead.

'I found my passport which I’d been using for ID and was looking at this flight app on my phone and it was saying something like "cheap flights to Paris".

'I decided the best thing to do was book a flight to see the Eiffel tower. It was just a spur of the moment thing and seemed like a good idea at the time.

'The taxi driver asked me about where I was going and what I was going to do in Paris but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him I was a drunken idiot who spontaneously booked a trip to Paris, so I sold him some story that I was a junior doctor going to a convention.'

Travelling light: Luke snapped this picture (left) before he boarded the flight. He said he tried to act as sober as possible when he checked in. After he woke up at the airport, he caught a bus into Paris and wandered around taking pictures (right)

Mr Harding said the idea to go abroad had only struck him in the cab, so he didn't even have a bag or a change of clothes.

'I arrived at Terminal 3 and walked through to the check In where I tried and acted sober as I could and speaking as little as possible.' He continued, 'I had no luggage and I remembered the lady at the check in asking if I had any - then she joked that I was travelling light.

'I don’t recall much of the flight because I fell asleep and then the next thing I know I find myself lay next to a toilet in a cubicle in the middle of Charles De Gaulle airport and thinking what the hell have I just done?

'When I woke up I initially didn’t know where I was but then I remembered a bit about being in Manchester airport and booking the flight to Paris - and thinking ‘oh sh*t.’

Sightseeing: Luke had a coffee and a croissant outside the Arc de Triomphe but could not go up the Eiffel Tower because there was a big queue

'I rang my mum and said "don’t panic mum but can you pick me up at Manchester Airport at 8pm?" Then I told her what I had done and she went mental at me.

'I had eight hours to kill so I booked a bus into Paris and had a wander around. I did get to see the Eiffel Tower but there was a massive queue so I didn’t get to go up it but at least I had my picture taken outside the Arc de Triomphe and I went to a cafe for coffee and a croissant and sat outside.

'It was great but it was bloody freezing, it’s warmer back here. It cost an arm and a leg but I don’t regret it. It’s a funny story to tell my mates for years to come.'

Luke was inundated with messages from Twitter uses amused by his escapade. Mark Ingham said: 'I’ve ended up in a few scary places after a night out in Tokes but never Paris. Take a bow.'

Dale Harris said: 'Don’t even know Luke Harding but I want to shake his hand.'

Manchester Airport declined to comment about the incident. Flybe said they were unable to provide a comment.
