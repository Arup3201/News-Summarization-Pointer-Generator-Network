Suspect: Isaiah Sweet, 17, was arrested on Monday and charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the death of his grandparents

The grandson of an elderly couple who were found slain at their home over the weekend has been arrested and charged with their murders after he allegedly told friends he hated them and wanted to kill them.

Police captured Isaiah Sweet, 17,  from Iowa, in Cedar Rapids after a short chase on Monday.

They had been looking for him since they found the bodies of Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, in their Manchester home on Sunday after relatives arrived for Mother's Day celebrations.

Police believe they were murdered on Friday. Since then, the teen used his Twitter page to post a number of cryptic messages which police believe are about the murders. 

They included: 'Time to live my life', 'I'm f***ed up, torn down, I'm twisted, doorknob', and 'My phone is as big as hell right now'.

The teen was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the death of his grandparents, who he lived with.

After he was arrested the tweets continued on his alleged Twitter page, where he uses the pseudonym Isweet37.

They said: 'You drunk c*** f***ing snitch', 'Damn. Cant wait to get outa the cop shop' and 'All youve done the past 30 minutes is sit in a corner and text? #Retardcop'.

Shackled and in orange prison uniform, the 17-year-old remained silent throughout most of his initial courtroom appearance this afternoon. He is being held on $1million bond.

He also faces a charge of operating a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent.

According to a Delaware County criminal complaint, in the hours following the death of his grandparents, Sweet discussed the killings with several friends, and told a few that he was 'on the run'. 

According to the Telegraph Herald Sweet allegedly told one witness, Darrian Marie Fleischacker, that he drugged his grandparents and thought they were dead as he was unable to locate a pulse.

Autopsies were performed on Monday but authorities have not released the cause of death.

Tweets: Isaiah's alleged Twitter profile had a flurry of activity over the weekend and on Friday, at the time his grandparents were murdered, he posted 'Time to live my life'

A close friend told The Des Moines Register that the teen hated his grandparents and would often say he wanted to kill them. She described their relationship as 'contentious'.

Jade Offerman said: 'He never got along with his grandparents. He absolutely — he hated them. Sometimes he tried to get along as best as he could with them just to make his life easier.'

Miss Offerman said she dated Sweet on-and-off last fall, and they remained friends after breaking up.

She said the believed the grandparents, particularly the grandfather, were sometimes strict with the teen but didn't believe anything he said about wanting to kill them.

'I never took him seriously. He’d be like, "I hate them so much. I’m going to kill them". But obviously you hate your parents sometimes and you say stuff like that,' she said.

'Nobody takes you seriously.'

Last Saturday night, Sweet drove Miss Offerman and some friends to a party at an apartment in downtown Iowa City in a truck which is believed to have belonged to the elderly couple.

One of the passengers, Kelli Fisher, 19, said Sweet had drugs in the vehicle including marijuana and prescription painkillers.

The labels were scratched off on the bottles, said Miss Fisher, and she noticed he was 'visibly shaking' and carrying a knife.

She told The Des Moines Register: 'He showed us a knife that he had just bought, which was really weird…It was smaller, but it had very, very jaggedly edges.'

Miss Offerman said Sweet called her on Sunday and acted very strange and secretive but said it sounded like a goodbye call after he said to her: 'I love you. I miss you. You’re never going to see me again.'

The accused murderer allegedly told at least three people that he had drugged his grandparents and killed them, according to court records.

Richard and Janet Sweet were said to be facing financial difficulties and Mr sweet faced a first-degree theft charge for allegedly taking $10,000 from the trust for Marie Ann Sweet, his mother.

Court records show Janet Sweet was served an eviction case dated July 2011. In December, Janet Sweet filed a child-support case against Stacy Sweet, Isaiah Sweet’s mother.
