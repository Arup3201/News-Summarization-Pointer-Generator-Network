The Countess of Wessex today attended the Falmouth to Royal Greenwich Tall Ships Regatta, meeting sailors at the finish line.

Sophie looked relaxed and happy as she chatted with the young sailors, even happily posing for a selfie with one lucky young man.

The 49-year-old wore a causal outfit for the outdoor event, choosing a bold pair of bright green cropped trousers, purple T-shirt with a white dolphin design, and navy blazer.

The trendy mother-of-two even wore a pair of tanned Converse trainers; an unusually youthful option even for the increasingly modern Royal family.

Almost half of the vessels competing in the regatta are members of ASTO, the UK’s Sail Training umbrella organisation.

ASTO has vessels from all over the British Isles taking part including Scotland, Wales, East Anglia and the South of England, and at least half of the trainees on board each boat will be under 25.

Over 280 young people from a wide range of backgrounds are sailing on board 19 boats operated by ASTO members.

It is the first time a Tall Ships Race has both started and finished in a UK port, and one of the few events in recent months that Sophie has attended solo, usually seen with Prince Edward at official engagements.

The couple recently took a break from royal duties on a family holiday with their two children James, Viscount Severn, seven, and Lady Louise Windsor, 10.

Edward and Sophie enjoyed a vacation last month, on the tiny uninhabited island of Espalmador, off Ibiza, which is famous with some visitors for its naturist beaches and mud baths.

Sophie showed off the results of her rumoured new health and fitness regime on the beach in a red swimsuit.

Sophie has dropped a dress size and shed a stone in weight after taking hour-long exercise sessions several times a week with a personal trainer.

Edward, who celebrated his 50th in March, also looked trim. He has been so impressed by his wife’s transformation that he engaged the same trainer.

The couple, who celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary last month, now go on twice-weekly five-mile runs around the grounds of their home at Bagshot Park, near Windsor.
