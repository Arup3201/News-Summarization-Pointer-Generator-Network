A teenager was jailed for thirty days after sticking her finger up at a judge during sentencing yesterday.

Penelope Soto was appearing after being arrested for drug possession, but after her bond was set she made the offensive gesture to Miami-Dade 
Circuit Judge Jorge Rodriguez-Chomat.

As a result she was hauled back in front of the judge and given a jail sentence for contempt of court.

Soto had earlier appeared in court after being arrested for drug possession. After her bond was set she made the offensive gesture

The exchange, seen in a video posted on LiveLeak, began when Soto was asked about her financial assets.

Standing up in court wearing an orange jumpsuit told him she earned $200 a week and said her assets included her jewellery and a car.

When he asked her how much her jewellery was worth, she laughed, and said 'a lot.'

Shock: Sotot pulled on her hair and locked shocked as the judge upped her punishment as a result of her behaviour

Realising her laughter did not reflect the gravity of the situation Judge Rodriguez-Chomat told her: 'It's not a joke, you know, we're not in a club now,'

'We are not in a club, be serious about it.'

Still looking amused and stroking her hair Soto answered 'I'm serious about it, you just made me laugh.'

'You just made me laugh, I apologize. It's worth a lot of money,' she continued. 

Judge Rodriguez-Chomat asked Soto if she had taken any drugs in the past 24 hours, which she denied.

Throughout the exchange Soto's facial
 expressions varied from boredom to amusement and she was constantly 
moving and flicking her hair.

Judge Rodriguez-Chomat then set Soto's bond at $5,000 and said 'bye, bye.'

In response, Soto laughed and replied 'Adios' as she walked away.

After a second's hesitation, Judge Rodriguez-Chomat called Soto back and asked for the papers to be handed back to him.

After scribbling on them, he then reset her bond at $10,000, to which a shocked Soto replied: 'Are you serious?'

As she turned to walk away again Soto gave the finger to Judge Rodriguez-Chomat and said: F***  you.'

Again looking amused Judge Rodriguez-Chomat called Soto back again and gave her a 30-day jail sentence for contempt of court.

Soto had appeared in court on Monday for possession of Xanax bars - the anti-anxiety drug is available on prescription, but is commonly used as an easy high.
