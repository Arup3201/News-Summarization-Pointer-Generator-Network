As he laid on the ground, his attackers continued to violently stomp on his back and head.

His 23-year-old girlfriend ran to  protect him and tried to stop the men but they turned on her and threw her to the ground by her hair. 

The sickening footage shows one of the attackers continuously kicking the girl in the face and stomping on her shoulders as she huddled on the ground trying to defend herself. 

Two men, believed to be bar staff, were filmed trying to restrain the attackers before a female bystander pushed her way through and kicked the young woman.
