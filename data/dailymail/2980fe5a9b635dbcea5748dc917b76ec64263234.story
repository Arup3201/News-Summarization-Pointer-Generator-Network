Hundreds of elderly North and South 
Koreans, separated by war more than six decades ago, were being 
tearfully reunited today during a rare period of eased relations between
 the two countries.

More
 than 100 elderly South Koreans travelled through falling snow to North Korea's Diamond Mountain to reunite with 
relatives they had not seen since the Korean War, which lasted from 1950
 to 1953. About 180 North Koreans were also expected, Seoul has said.

Elderly
 women in traditional hanbok dresses were seen on South Korean TV 
talking and hugging at the resort while stooped men wiped away tears. The reunions however are due to be short lived as the families are once again expected to part in a few days.

More
 reunions are planned until Tuesday. This round of reunions over
 the world's most heavily fortified border, the first since 2010, comes 
amid a North Korean charm offensive.

Among
 the South Koreans making the journey to the reunion was octogenarian 
Jang Choon, who bought a new suit before he finally made it to North 
Korea to meet the family he has not seen since the war.

Meanwhile,
 Kim Dong-bin, a 78-year-old diagnosed with lung cancer last September, 
has been undergoing chemotherapy, which he said would allow him to meet 
the elder sister he was separated from more than 60 years ago, before he 
dies.

Kim, who fled 
south when he was 16, fearing U.S. attacks on Pyongyang during the war, 
said: 'I am afraid my family in North Korea might still think I came to 
the South to live a good life for me alone.

'Before
 I die, I must explain that I did not abandon my family, that I was 
swept up by the refugee flow during the chaos. Resolving this 
misunderstanding is the first thing I want to do in person with my 
sister,' he said.

The 
reunions used to be held roughly annually, but have not taken place 
since 2010 as tensions between the two Koreas spiralled after the South 
said the North sank one of its naval vessels. In later months, the North
 shelled a South Korean island and Pyongyang threatened nuclear attacks 
last year.Â

Millions of other Koreans have been separated from loved ones since the three-year war that ended in 1953

'My youngest 
brother Ha-choon had not even started school when I last saw him,' said 
Jang, the eldest of four siblings, one of whom has died.

He said: 'But now he's an old man like me.'

Jang
 was conscripted by the North Korean army at 19 but ended up being 
captured and, when given a choice to return to his home in North 
Hamgyong Province near the Russian border, he opted to stay in the 
South.

Those taking part in the reunions however 
were only the lucky few - millions of other Koreans have been separated 
from loved ones since the three-year war that ended in 1953.

During
 a previous period of inter-Korean rapprochement, about 22,000 Koreans 
had brief reunions - 18,000 in person and the others by video. None got a
 second chance to reunite, Seoul says.

The
 rival nations struck a deal last week to go ahead with brief meetings 
of war-divided families, although there was wariness in Seoul that 
Pyongyang could back out.

North
 Korea is pushing for better ties with the South, and has ratcheted down
 harsh rhetoric that swelled last spring with a torrent of threats to 
launch nuclear strikes against Seoul and Washington.

Analysts say the North hopes better relations with Seoul will attract badly needed foreign investment and aid.

The
 six days of family reunions take place under the cloud of a U.N. report
 on human rights abuses in North Korea, which investigators have said 
were comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.

Pyongyang
 has rejected the report, describing it as a concoction by the United

In
 2000, South Korea created a computerised lottery system for South 
Koreans hoping for reunions, and since then nearly 130,000 people, most 
in their 70s or older, have entered. Only about 70,000 are still alive.

Those selected for aborted reunions in September get another chance this week.

However,
 two of the South Koreans selected and three of North Koreans have died 
since then, according to South Korea's Red Cross, which is helping 
arrange the meetings along with its North Korean counterpart.

The
 two Koreas have been in a near-constant standoff since an armistice 
ended the Korean War. It hasn't been replaced with a peace treaty, 
leaving the peninsula still technically in a state of war. About 28,000 
U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help deter aggression from 
North Korea.
