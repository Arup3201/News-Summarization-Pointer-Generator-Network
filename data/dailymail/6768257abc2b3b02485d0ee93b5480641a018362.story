A master double agent famous for escaping the British Establishment to Soviet Russia may have been encouraged to defect by a fellow spy, it has emerged.

In a letter from the USSR to a lifelong friend who he betrayed, Kim Philby - one of the infamous Cambridge Five - suggested MI6 figures wanted to wash their hands of him.

Published for the first time today in The Times, the letter was written by Philby to his colleague Nicholas Elliott soon after he was able to flee to a new life in Moscow despite being accused of treachery in Parliament.

It used the spy slang for defection - 'do me a fade' - to suggest Elliott had encouraged him to defect to Soviet Russia.

'Dear Nick,' he wrote. 'I wonder if this letter 
will surprise you.

'Our last transactions were so strange 
that I cannot help thinking that perhaps you wanted me to do a fade. It 
is invariably with pleasure that I remember our meetings and talks.

'They
 did much to help one get one's bearings in this complicated world! I 
deeply appreciate, now as ever, our old friendship, and I hope that 
rumours which have reached me about your having had some trouble on my 
account, are exaggerated.'

The letter was uncovered by the journalist and historian Ben Macintyre as he researched a new book, A Spy Among Friends.

Serialised in the Times, the account describes how Philby abused his friendship with Elliott, with whom he had risen through the MI6, passing information to the Russians which led to the deaths of some of Elliott's contacts.

According to the Times, the extraordinary letter asked Elliott to meet him in Finland - and he wanted to go so he could exact revenge on his treacherous friend, who had destroyed his career.

Instead he eventually replied with the words: 'Put some flowers for me on poor Volkov's grave', a reference to would-be defector Konstantin Volkov who was outed through Philby's betrayal.

In a secret service steeped in the paranoia of the Cold War, the 'Cambridge Five' escaped detection for many years, rising to the highest levels of the MI6.

The scandal rocked the Establishment by revealing Soviet double agents at the heart of many of Britain's most storied institutions.

Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt all met at the University of Cambridge, where Blunt was an academic and the other three were undergraduates.

The older man recruited the students to the Soviet cause before the Second World War - and they remained devoted to the USSR even after the start of the Cold War.

Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6, Maclean was a Foreign Office official and Burgess worked for the BBC.

Blunt was the most eminent of all, as director of the Courtauld Institute and keeper of the royal family's art collection.

In 1951, Burgess and Maclean were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by Philby, they were able to escape to Moscow.

Despite the suspicion surrounding Philby, he avoided detection for another 12 years until 1963, when he too defected to the USSR.

It was claimed last week that MI6 chiefs were so convinced Philby could not be a traitor because of his Establishment background and trustworthiness that they shielded him from official probes.

Blunt escaped exposure for even longer. It was not until 1979, when Margaret Thatcher named him as a suspect in the House of Commons, that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles.

The 'fifth man' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified, but was named as John Cairncross by KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky.

The story of the unlikely traitors has been dramatised several times, including in John le Carré's classic book Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and the film of the same name.
