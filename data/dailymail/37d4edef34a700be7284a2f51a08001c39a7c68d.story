The parents of a 17-year-old football player whose teacher allegedly performed a sex act on him after a pep rally have filed a $3million lawsuit against the school. 

Symone Greene, 22, was arrested last week on charges that she has sex with the student on her first day teaching at Options Public Charter School in Washington, D.C.

The boy's parent's claim that the school and the private company that hired Greene didn't do enough to ensure she wouldn't prey on the vulnerable students under her care, WRC-TV reports.

Greene is also named in the suit.

Symone Greene, 22, is accused of performing a sex act on a 17-year-old student in her classroom on her very first day of school

Greene is charged with firs-degree sexual abuse of a minor because as a teacher she had power of the teen

The teen, a football player, recorded Greene performing a sex act on him after a high school pep rally for the team, authorities say 

They say their son has a learning disability and that Greene took advantage of him on October 17 when she allegedly had sexual relations with him in an empty classroom following a pep rally for the football team. 

The lawsuit alleges that Green initiated the flirting that led to the alleged sexual encounter and that another teacher witnessed the flirting but did nothing to intervene. 

The teen told police that he 'flirted' with the teacher earlier in the day on October 17 and that he sent a text message to her asking if she was 'kinky.'

None of that matters says the lawyer for the boy's family. 

'Even if that young man came into his classroom wearing nothing but boxers and came on even stronger than what's been alleged in the complaint, then that teacher had a duty to step in and stop that behavior, notify the proper authorities and hold fast to the standard which we has members of the society expect our teachers to live up to,' Governor Jackson told WRC. 

The sex attack at the end of the school's pep rally - it allegedly occurred in Greene's classroom where the student recorded the oral sex,  without Greene's knowledge, according to the warrant. 

Greene then allegedly sent the teen a text message over the weekend asking him not to tell anyone because 'it is not right for a student and teacher to have a relationship.'

Greene allegedly let the boy take video of the sexual encounter, which he then shared with his football teammates and other friends.  She posted this photo on her Google+ account

Symone Greene, 22, was working at Options Public Charter School (pictured) in Northeast D.C. on Friday when she first met the victim, a 17-year-old football player, according to court documents

She also allegedly sent a clothed picture of herself to the student, reports WUSA.

'When school administrators learned of the incident Monday morning, we immediately contacted the Child and Family Services Agency, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the parent of the student,' Shannon Hodge, the school's executive director, said in a statement. 

Hodge said Greene was contracted through a company based in Delaware and had never worked at the school before.

Greene was arrested and charged this week, according to the documents.
