Heartless: Isabel Gloria McDaniel, 30 (pictured), stands accused of fatally hitting a  67-year-old man with her car and then continuing to drive while he was stuck on top of the vehicle 

Police in Springfield, Oregon, believe a driver hit a pedestrian and fled with him on top of her car, carrying the man for half a mile before removing him and leaving him in the street to die.

The Register-Guard reports that Isabel Gloria McDaniel, 30, of Veneta was arrested Saturday.

She's accused of hitting both Julio Ortiz, 39, and his father 67-year-old Mexican national Daniel Ortiz-Reynaga on Thursday. 

Julio was only clipped by McDaniel, but his father was hit harder and the impact caused him to flip on top of the vehicle. 

McDaniel continued to drive for another 11 blocks before the victim was dropped.

Sgt Richard Scharboneau told KMTR that officers were trying to help Julio, when the man realized his father was missing and they located him down the street. 

Investigators believe McDaniel  took the victim off the car and kept going.

Ortiz-Reynaga was pronounced dead at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center.

McDaniel was arrested without incident Saturday night, after police released a description of her vehicle, and sources led authorities to the car parked in her garage.

She remained jailed Monday. Scharboneau says McDaniel is scheduled for arraignment Monday afternoon on a felony hit-and-run charge, where she may have a lawyer appointed.

Police say McDaniel's 24-year-old husband, Gary Louis McDaniel, was cited for tampering with evidence. 

The victim's grandson, who shares the same first and last name, told KMTR that he had a happy last meeting with his grandfather, talking about a trip to Mexico the younger Daniel had to miss. 

He doesn't understand what would cause someone to heartlessly leave his grandfather to die.  

'I would just ask them why they kept driving,' the grandson said. 'I want to know their point of view because I really don't understand.'
