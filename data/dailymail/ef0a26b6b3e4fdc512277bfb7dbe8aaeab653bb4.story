Tottenham are set to announce the signing of Ben Davies from Swansea City after completing a deal for the Wales left back.

The 21-year-old had a medical with Spurs at the weekend while the two clubs were on their respective tours of the USA.

Swansea will re-sign Gylfi Sigurdsson as a straight swap for Davies and, in addition, Mauricio Pochettino has reached a deal to sign goalkeeper Michel Vorm for a fee understood to be in the region of £3.5m.

A Swansea source told Sportsmail that all three deals had been finalised.

Sigurdsson
 is expected to join Swansea on a three-year contract, having impressed 
on loan from Hoffenheim in the second half of the 2011-12 season.

Tottenham
 had an initial bid of £8m rejected for Davies, with Swansea keen to 
include attacking midfielder Sigurdsson in any deal, having offloaded 
Michu to Napoli on a season-long loan.

The development is a blow to Liverpool, who had also been in the frame to sign Davies.

Davies,
 a product of Swansea’s youth set-up, has had a stunning rise through 
the ranks at the club. He was thrown into the first team in September 
2012 after Neil Taylor broke his leg and has since kept the Wales 
international out of the side.

The deals should ensure Swansea keep Taylor, who was poised to leave for first-team football.
