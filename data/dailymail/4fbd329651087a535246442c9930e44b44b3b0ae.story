Thieves cut a large rectangle hole out of an expensive jewellery store window in the middle of the afternoon to steal around 100 diamond rings, before they fled on motorbikes.

The burglary took just over a minute while customers and staff were still inside Griffin's Jewellers in Prospect Street in Bridlington, north Yorkshire and the street was busy.

Steve Gregory, manager of the store, estimates around £400,000 worth of jewellery was stolen in the raid.

He said the three thieves, all wearing helmets, fled on motorbikes after the shop's automatic shutters came down. Customers and staff at a nearby pub then started to chase them.

A large  rectangle was cut out of the front window of Griffin's Jewellers in Bridlington in the daytime while customers were inside before thieves fled with around 100 diamond rings, estimated to be worth £400,000

Mr Gregory said: 'We have quite a high staff level, so it's very difficult for anyone to attempt anything inside, which is why we think they went for the window. 

'Staff were shaken but fortunately no one was hurt. 

'It was all captured on CCTV and probably  was over in about a minute and 10 seconds before our automatic shutter came down.' 

The theft took place shortly before the store was due to close at 5pm on Monday, which meant there were more staff than normal on the shop floor. 

After the thieves fled with their haul glass, rings and other jewellery were left scattered on the pavement.  

Due to the high value of items in the shop customers can only gain entry by ringing a doorbell.

The business sells jewellery and clocks and is officially listed in the top 100 UK Jewellers.

Mr Gregory, who has worked for the company for 38 years, said this was the first time a raid had happened during the day. He said the last time the store was burgled was 20 years ago during the night, and thieves made off with less of a haul.

He added: 'Fortunately we had the high staff levels at the end of the day and a high security locking system. 

'The very nature of the trade that we are in means we very conscious of security. It happened so quickly and unexpectedly but some customers in the store and at the Half Moon pub opposite gave chase. It was a very valiant effort.' 

Mr Gregory said the store was still open for business on Tuesday and they were now considering how to get an even faster automatic shutter locking system for the window. 

The huge square was cut out shortly before the jewellery store was due to close for the day at 5pm on Monday

A 48-year-old man, who did not wish to give his name, was at the scene shortly after it happened.

He said: 'It looked like a real professional job.

'The window was cut in a perfect square and it looks as though the glass was lifted out - all done while the shop was still open.

'Griffin is a well known jeweller in Bridlington and sells high-class jewellery.' 

Jenni Hird said: 'I drove by at about 5.30pm and there were police outside and a lot of people there having a look.

'I was gob smacked at how clean the cut looked and the fact whoever did this had the balls to do it during opening hours, when the street will probably have been busy with people going past.

'There must have been quite a few people there.

'It must all have been over very quickly.

'It is madness.'
