Jeremy Hunt is thought to have rejected the call for individuals to be subject to the duty of candour

Hospitals and GP surgeries that conceal mistakes that harm patients will be punished, under rules to be unveiled by the Health Secretary next week.

The NHS will be subject to a new ‘duty of  candour’ – a key recommendation in the independent report on Mid-Staffordshire, where hundreds died due to appalling care.

Robert Francis QC, the report’s author, called for a law to apply to both institutions and individuals such as doctors, nurses and managers.

However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is thought to have rejected the call for individuals to be subject to the duty of candour.

Instead, NHS trusts and GP surgeries would be held responsible, and could face fines.

Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents – which has been campaigning for a statutory duty of candour for 30 years – said that, although it was disappointing the rule will not apply to staff themselves, it would still be ‘fundamental to changing the culture of the NHS’.

He added: ‘A corporate duty would mean organisations would have to make it known to every single member of their staff.

'They would have to demonstrate where there were breaches [that] they had taken action.’

Don Redding of National Voices, which represents health and social care charities, said: ‘In cases where patients have been harmed or worse, both senior managers and their legal advisers have generally decided their first duty is to the interests of the trust.

'This new legal duty will rebalance that by giving them a duty to disclose what went wrong and why.

‘Like the new policy on gagging orders [which have been banned in the NHS by Mr Hunt], it should remove a huge chunk of the culture of cover-ups – in this case, one which has been particularly harmful and distressing to patients, who have had to fight their care providers to get at the truth.’

In his report on Mid-Staffordshire, Mr Francis called for a statutory obligation on individuals and healthcare providers who ‘believe or suspect’ that their treatment or care has caused death or serious injury to inform the patient or their relatives as soon as possible.

It is thought the duty will apply to all providers regulated by the Care Quality Commission.
