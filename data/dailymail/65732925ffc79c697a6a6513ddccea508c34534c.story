The trailer for Lena Dunham's new documentary about Hilary Knight, the artist who illustrated the famed Eloise children's books, has been unveiled, five weeks after it was screened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.

The 36-minute HBO film, which profiles the esteemed 88-year-old New Yorker and his storied career, first came about in 2013 after Mr Knight heard that Miss Dunham, 28, had a tattoo of Eloise on her back, and wrote to the Girls creator to initiate contact.

Miss Dunham, who made It's Me, Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise with her Girls co-producer Jenni Konner, has long cherished the popular book series, written in the 50s by author Kay Thompson and chronicling the misadventures of a precocious six-year-old girl who lives in New York's Plaza Hotel.

The trailer hints at the close friendship which ultimately formed between Miss Dunham and Mr Knight, showing them larking around and filming one another, Miss Dunham in one clip donning an Eloise-style wig.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, the famed illustrator said of Miss Dunham: 'It was as though I had known her all my life. We totally bonded.'

Miss Dunham admits she closely relates to the fictional character Mr Knight brought to life all those years ago.

'Eloise is the p****d off little riot girl in all of us,' she says fondly, while the film's director Matt Wolfe describes Eloise as 'a punky feminist icon from the 50s, drawn by a man in his mid-twenties '.

Kindred spirit: Mr Knight (L) wrote to Miss Dunham (R) in February 2013 and praised her as a 'smart, sassy fan' who 'definitely understands' Eloise's character 

According to the film's synopsis, Mr Knight is 'as remarkable a character' as Eloise herself.

'Temperamental, flamboyant, on the one hand fiercely private and on the other desperate to make his legacy known', it states.

'What emerges is a portrait of an artist stunted by early success and haunted by personal failures, and deeply devoted to his most famous creation'.

The film also touches on Mr Knight's lengthy battle with Eloise's author, Kay Thompson, over the rights to the character.

Ms Thompson, who lived in the Plaza herself and is speculated to have based Eloise on her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli, died in 1998 at the age of 88.

Mr Knight wrote to Miss Dunham about her Eloise tattoo in February 2013. 

His later stated: 'First, I must say how pleased I am for you and all your awards and new plans.

'To know a smart, sassy fan who definitely understands this child is a thrill for me.'

The tattoo in question was Miss Dunham's very first inking, which she had done in a New Mexico strip mall when she was 17.

'That was my first tattoo because it felt like the only thing that I knew I would never get sick of,' she told The New York Daily News last month at the film's Sundance premiere.

'My childhood affinity for her never wavered, and I felt so connected to the character, and tattoos are about self-expression and self-knowledge, and that seemed like the perfect entrée into this.'

It's Me, Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise premieres on HBO March 23 at 9pm.
