It doesn't happen often, but when four genuine striking superstars come together for 90 minutes you just have to sit back and enjoy. Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Suarez and one Zlatan Ibrahimovic all under the same roof doing battle as Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain faced off.

Ibrahimovic, of course, sees himself as the main man in that quartet and rocked up at the Nou Camp ready to dazzle on Wednesday night.

Typically, he didn't disappoint.

There is forever an air of Ibrahimovic having something to prove when the Swede is back at his former club - something intensified with the presence of not just Messi but with his trusty attacking double-act as well.

Four stars at the peak of their powers would ordinarily be quite enough, but to see each score on the same night is something that barely ever comes round.

The four were utterly dominant, a cut above the rest as Barcelona won 3-1  and maintained their spot as group winners.

Ibrahimovic put the visitors ahead, intelligently dropping off the front to wrong-foot Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Cue the brash leap in the air and pump of the arms; he brings drama and it had real effect on Barca's stars.

Messi and Neymar are a lethal pairing together - particularly when Suarez is added into the mix

Messi had quite enough of the attention centring on a visitor, gambling at the back post to equalise, while Neymar scored the pick of the bunch.

The Brazilian drove on from midfield, forcing the PSG defence to furiously backpedal, and bent a wicked effort from 25 yards. This was blockbuster stuff.

Even Suarez got in on the act, notching his second in Barcelona colours after Messi unselfishly allow the striker to tap in from six yards.

But it is not just with their goals that set this quartet above the rest.

Messi purred, getting himself on the ball consistently and trying to break the resistance de París with a series of mecurial runs, while Ibrahimovic's eyes lit up on more than one occasion as he peppered the home goal.

These are the players you pay your money - around £100 for a ticket - to see. Whether there will be many more occasions when four genuine worldbeaters score in the same game seems a tall order. 

A night to be treasured.
