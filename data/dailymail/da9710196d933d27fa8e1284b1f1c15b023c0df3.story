A newborn girl in China was born seemingly ‘pregnant’ with twins, due to an extremely rare condition.

Doctors said the girl may have condition known as ‘fetus in fetu’ – which is so rare it affects less than 1 in 500,000 births, and there are only 200 reports of it ever happening.

It is a developmental abnormality where two identical twins develop in the womb, but one dies, and its undeveloped fetus is absorbed into the remaining twin’s body. 

A newborn girl in China was born with two growths in her stomach. Scans showed the masses had all the characteristics of 10-week old fetuses. Pictured is a scan with arrows showing the spine of each fetus

However, the doctors reporting the case said this was a controversial diagnosis and it could be the baby girl was suffering from a type of cancer in which the tumour is well-developed and appears like a fetus.

The case, reported in the Hong Kong Medical Journal, describes a baby girl was born with two masses in her abdominal area who was being treated in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, in November 2010.

This baffled doctors, as the baby had no evidence of a blockage in her intestine and fed normally after birth.

They believed they might be tumours, and carried out an ultrasound which revealed there were two masses with a total diameter of 47mm between the baby girl’s spleen and the left kidney.

They discovered the ‘tumours’ were, in fact, two 8 to 10 week-old fetuses.

Each had umbilical cords, limbs, skin, rib cages, brain tissue, spines, intestines, genitalia of ambiguous gender and other parts common in 10-week-old fetuses.

They removed the fetuses in an operation when she was three weeks old, and found they were 37mm and 35mm in length.

The larger fetus weighed 14.2g while the smaller weighed 9.3g.

Fetus in fetu is an incredibly rare condition that affects only one in five million live births.

It is a condition where the malformed fetus is found in the body of its twin. 

The fetus is found in the abdomen in 80 per cent of cases, although there have been reports of it occurring in the skull. 

There are only 200 reports of it ever happening.

While the diagnosis is gaining popularity, the World Health Organisation has classified ‘fetus in fetu’ as a variant of mature teratoma, a type of cancer where the tumour is well-developed.

The World Health Organisation has classified ‘fetus in fetu’ as a variant of mature teratoma, a type of cancer where the tumour is well-developed.

There is another theory, known as the theory of ‘monozygotic diamniotic twins’.

This proposes that identical twins formed from the same egg started developing in the womb.

The theory says one of the developing twins died, and its undeveloped remains is absorbed into the other twin’s body.

Writing in the case report, the doctors said: ‘The theory of demised multiple pregnancy has gained much support recently.

‘Despite the gaining popularity, there is, as yet no concrete evidence to confirm this relationship.

‘Our case report does not support the popular monozygotic multiple pregnancy theory, and favours, by default, the traditional classification into a teratoma.’ 

Most of the cases of fetus in fetu are discovered in infancy, although in one case, farmer from India only discovered he was suffering from the  condition when he was 36 years old and it looked like he was pregnant, Starcasm reports.

In 2012, MailOnline reported on the case of an 11-year-old schoolgirl was admitted to a hospital in China with a third arm sprouting out of her back.

In 2012, MailOnline reported on the case of an 11-year-old schoolgirl was admitted to a hospital in China with a third arm and a breast sprouting out of her back (pictured). She was diagnosed with fetus in fetu, and the growth was revealed to be part of an identical twin that failed to develop and was absorbed into her body

She was diagnosed with fetus in fetu, and the large mass was revealed to be part of an identical twin that had failed to develop and had been enveloped into the body of its sister.

Further investigation found it consisted of a breast and an arm which included a shoulder blade and two fingers. 

In 2009, MailOnline also reported on the case of a one-year-old girls who survived surgery to remove her unborn twin’s fetus from her swollen stomach.

Kang Mengru's adoptive parents were shocked when within months after her birth, her stomach began to swell and superstitious neighbours began calling the little girl a 'monster' and gossiping that she was pregnant.

Medical scans revealed Kang was actually carrying the parasitic fetus of her unborn twin in her belly.
