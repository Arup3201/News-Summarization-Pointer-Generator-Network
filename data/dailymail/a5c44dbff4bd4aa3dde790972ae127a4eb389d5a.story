She has been in the role just over two months, and Zara Phillips seems to be taking to motherhood with no mess nor fuss.

The Royal equestrian, 32, carried baby girl Mia, who was born on January 17, over her shoulder as the pair headed out to see daddy Mike Tindall play rugby yesterday.

Zara was clad in a comfortable pair of boots and warm beanie and jacket as Mia wore a cute onesie. Mother and daughter had cause to celebrate as Mike, 35, captained Gloucester to a 40-33 victory over Newcastle Falcons.

Following his win Mike took over baby duty today as he took Mia out in a stroller, while Zara returned to work at Point to point where she trains horses.

He was joined at the Land Rover Gatcombe Horse Trails with Zara's brother Peter and his family, wife Autumn and children Savannah, three, and one-year-old Isla.

Savannah, the Queen's eldest great-grandchild, looked to be a bit of a handful as she frolicked around happily enjoying the sunshine with her dog.

Wearing a red coat, denim skirt and black boots the playful tot wore her royal parents out as she ran back and forth while they took time out from watching the horses.

Grandmother Princess Anne could be seen happily watching and laughing at the young adventurer from the sidelines.

The happy family disappeared briefly to enjoy lunch in a private tent but excitable Savannah, who is 13th in line to the throne, emerged shortly afterwards.

The Gatcombe Horse Trials, in the picturesque Cotswolds, Glos., is an annual weekend event which features cross country, show jumping and dressage events.

Peter Phillips is the only son of Princess Anne, and brother to new-mum Zara.
