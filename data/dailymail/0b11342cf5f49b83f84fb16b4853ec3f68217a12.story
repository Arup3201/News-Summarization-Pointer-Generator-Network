A knifeman who tried to murder four PCs demanded asked to be killed because he wanted ‘to come back as Freddie Kruger’ - the horror killer from the Nightmare On Elm Street, a court has heard.

As Christopher Haughton, 33, was placed in a police van after officers eventually managed to subdue him, he shouted ‘Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger.’

He added ‘F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die,’ as he chanted and hurled Caribbean insults, such as ‘you bumbaclat’.

When formally arrested at the police 
station, he replied: ‘You can f*****g put me in jail for life. I want 
to kill you all, I’ll kill more of you next time.’

He then said: ‘I curse all of you, I 
hope those officers die,’ ‘I’m Lucifer, you all have Aids now,’ and ‘I 
have Aids, I love giving women Aids. I hope you all get Aids.’

Prosecutor Ed Brown QC added: ‘Those 
comments, of course said in very heated moments, show however not only 
what, in that disturbed state, he hoped would happen but also what he 
had tried to do and had intended to do.

‘They also demonstrate an appreciation of the possible consequences of what he had done in the preceding few minutes.’

The jury heard earlier when police 
stopped him before he went on a rampage, Haughton had been looking at 
the sky shouting: ‘God help me kill my enemies.’

Haughton took a 10in knife from a 
butcher's shop in Kingsbury, north London, last November before 
launching his attack on the officers, the Old Bailey was told.

Prosecutor
Edward Brown QC said: 'Some of the officers suffered very significant 
injuries indeed, all the result of this defendant’s violence.

'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.'

One officer PC Thomas Harding tried to pin him down with a riot shield but Haughton managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach, it was said.

As another officer PC Alastair Hinchliff tried to restrain him, he too fell to the floor and Haughton slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth.

He then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their batons with no effect, it was claimed.

As they did that Haughton lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee causing a 15 cm wound.

The Old Bailey heard 'despite his continued violence, officers were able to pin the defendant against the meat display counter, with his head forced downwards.'

But as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away.

It was alleged that as police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck

Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'The scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital.

'Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van.

'Three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him. He continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained.'

But en route to the cells Haughton spat blood at them claiming he was HIV positive and then bit PC John Carlton on the leg.

Police had been called to reports of Haughton shouting out to God while looking upwards to heaven and praying in the street on Kingsbury Road, Harrow, north west London.

Two officers tried to speak to him but he refused to calm down before biting PC Stephen Barker on the arm. He then ran to an alley to grab bricks hitting PC Barker on the hand.

As back-up arrived Haughton made his way towards the butcher’s shop and threw a breeze block at the patrol car’s windscreen as it attempted to block his escape.

He then grabbed tins from a shop to hurl at them before entering the butcher’s.

Before launching his alleged attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a fillet knife, it was claimed in court

Mr Brown said: 'The defendant was angry and as you will come to appreciate directing all his anger towards the police.

'It was immediately clear why he had chosen to enter the butcher’s. He found a way through to the butchers’ area - through the staff door at the back. This is where the butchers cut and serve the meat.

'The next few moments witnessed a series of frenzied and quick moving attacks by this defendant on the police using the butcher’s knife which caused really significant injuries to three of the officers, potentially fatal, and to another the defendant came within millimetres of causing what would so easily have been a fatal injury.

'These were deliberate and intentional acts by the defendant towards the officers who were attempting to restrain him in what had become a very dangerous situation that he had caused, with the defendant taking no heed whatsoever of the repeated orders to calm down and to stop.'

The court heard a month earlier police were called to Haughton’s bedsit in Hopton Road, Wembley, as he played loud music and threatened other residents forcing them to flee.

When officers arrived he charged at them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers and they had to use CS spray to subdue him.

But he managed to bite WPC Vicky Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer whacked him on his shoulders with a baton.

He then spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face.

Haughton was on bail when he went on the rampage and 'it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th November.

'It will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time. In the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.'

But he added Haughton had the intention to kill the police officers as he had 'called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there, and threatened to do so,' and 'he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die.

'His actions were of course determined, dreadful and carried out in real anger, directed at the officers who were trying to detain him.

'The police had plainly become the object of his anger, perhaps as a result of the events in October.'

Haughton denies four counts of attempted murder on PC Harding, PC Hinchliff, PC Robb and PC Haque, two counts of ABH on PC Barker and PC Charlton, and one count of attempted GBH on driver PC David Weir relating to the rampage in November 2011.

He also denies ABH on WPC Vincent and common assault on WPC Spruce in October 2011.
