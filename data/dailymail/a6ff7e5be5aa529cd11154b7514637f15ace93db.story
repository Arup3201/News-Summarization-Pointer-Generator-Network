Britain looked blooming marvellous as the sun came out to play today.

At last, flower growers got some joy as the UK's only hyacinths bulb fields burst into bloom in Cambridgeshire one month later than usual.

In the Vale of Evesham, in the Cotswolds, asparagus growers finally started getting ready for the British Asparagus Festival on St George’s Day.

But in Ashridge, Hertfordshire, they're still waiting because the annual flowering of bluebells hasn't quite happened yet.

Usually, by mid-April the ground at Dockey Wood is blanketed in blue but the unseasonal cold spell  - which has also reduced Evesham's asparagus crop to only 10 per cent of what it should be - has put paid to that.

The Festival at Bretforton, near 
Evesham, on April 23 sees a day of celebration of the crop and the start
of the eight week season.

In the Cambridgeshire countryside, the
world's largest collection of rare hyacinths is putting on a stunning 
display of colour in a fragrance-filled two-acre field after Spring 
finally sprung.

Grandfather Alan Shipp, 75, has been 
custodian of the UK's National Collection of Hyacinths since 1989 and 
now has more than 150,000 flowering bulbs.

'The hyacinths are a good four weeks 
later than usual due to the cold weather, but there has been no damage 
to the flowers,' said Mr Shipp.

'It's the next three months which are important now as the weather will affect the size of the bulbs.

'We need plenty of sun to put energy into the bulbs, but we don't want it to be too hot as it shortens the growing season.'

Forecasters say Thetford in Norfolk is expected to be the hottest spot in the UK today reaching an almost summery 16C.

Shrewsbury
and Skipton will reach 15C and 14C while Lerwick on the Shetland 
Islands will be the UK's coolest place reaching just 5C.

With the weather staying warm, London could reach 17C on Wednesday.

While temperatures weren't exactly Mediterranean, after a seemingly endless winter yesterday’s warm weather was a good start.

As
predicted, it was the hottest day of the year so far with the 
thermometer peaking at 22C (72F) in Gravesend and Manston in Kent.

It is hoped the widespread temperature increase will jolt Mother Nature out of her unusually long hibernation.

Bluebells and some daffodils, which 
normally brighten the countryside and gardens with displays of colour, 
have yet to flower, while parks await the glorious burst of cherry 
blossom.

As for the bird population, there are 
fears that a lack of insects may have had terrible consequences for the 
tens of thousands of migrating birds that usually reach Britain by the 
start of April.

Some birds may have delayed their 
journey north, but ornithologists fear thousands of birds that rely on 
insects for food may have arrived and died.

The National Trust was expecting the 
‘main pulse’ of migrating birds – including swallows and house martins –
to arrive over the weekend with the help of strong southerly winds.

But Grahame Madge of the RSPB said: 
‘We’re actually not sure where they all are. Possibly many have already 
arrived and perished or they may be hanging around waiting for the right
conditions.’

He added: ‘When they arrive they are 
exhausted. They have probably lost half their body weight and are right 
on the edge of survival.

‘If they arrive and there are no insects to feed on they are in big trouble. We could be looking at a bleak picture.’

Bluebells are one wonder of the British countryside that have yet to appear.

It is thought peak flowering could be 
delayed until mid-May this year. There are also fears that many 
daffodils may not flower at all.

Tom Price, curator of Oxford 
University’s Botanic Garden, said: ‘It’s possible the bulbs have been 
damaged by the prolonged wet, and then very cold weather. Some of them 
could have rotted or died off in the soil.’

However, experts suggest the late spring could be a sign of an increasingly rare hot summer.

Matthew Oates, a naturalist for the 
National Trust, said: ‘There is a really good link between late springs 
and very good summers, and we are due, overdue, a very good summer.’

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Temperatures will drop a bit tomorrow but it will stay generally mild.’
