Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott is facing intense criticism from Democrats after he campaigned Tuesday with rocker Ted Nugent, who said at a national gun show last month that President Barack Obama is a 'communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel.'

CNN host Wolf Blitzer blasted Nugent hours later, drawing parallels between that language and words Nazis used to justify exterminating Jews during World War II.

Nugent's comments came at the SHOT show in Las Vegas, an annual event organized by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The camouflage cowboy hat-wearing musician is a prolific hunter and a regular defender of gun rights.

Abbott brought Nugent aboard, he said, in order to 'expose' the gun-control views of his opponent in this year's race for governor, state Senator Wendy Davis.

Nugent is getting hammered as a racist for his shocking statement that President Obama is a 'communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel'

He introduced the 1970s singer of hits like 'Cat scratch fever' as his 'blood brother' and 'friend.'

And he's making the calculation that Texans will give him – and Nugent – a pass because they dislike the president more than they want civility in political debates.

'Wendy Davis is more associated with Barack Obama than anybody in the state. I don't think there's anybody in the state who is more disliked than Barack Obama,' Abbott said Tuesday in the city of Denton, the site of a rally he held with Nugent at a Mexican restaurant.

But Abbott also told reporters that he is unaware of some of Nugent's more inflammatory statements.

'I don't know what he may have said or done in his background,' said Abbott.

'What I do know is Ted Nugent stands for the Constitution. He stands against the federal government overreaching.'

Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, Abbot's Democratic opponent, called the alliance 'repulsive'

Nugent spoke on behald of Abbott, who claimed he was unaware of the rocker's most shocking past statements

Last month at the SHOT show, Nugent half-facetiously told a group of onlookers – many with video cameras – that he accepted the blame for President Obama's success in politics.

“I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame, enough Americans to be ever vigilant,' he said, 'not to let a Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America.'

He also complained about weak-willed politicians on both the political right and left who 'check their scrotums in at the door – even Hillary.'

Video of his statements was first published by GUNS.com.

Davis, who came to national attention last year for a lengthy filibuster against a bill restricting the availability of abortions, has taken a knife-in-the-teeth approach to the GOP alliance between Nugent and her November opponent.

'Greg Abbott's embrace of Ted Nugent 
and his ideals is an insult to every woman in Texas, and it should be an
 insult to every man, every husband, brother, father, son in Texas,' she
 told KDFW in Dallas.

'I think the fact that Greg Abbott is embracing those values is repulsive.'

She also enlisted the help of Annie's List, a political group that works to elect female candidates, to circulate Nugent's past insults of women politicians.

He once called Hillary Clinton a 'worthless b***h.'

Davis made foot-in-mouth headlines recently for claiming Abbott, who is wheelchair-bound, 'hasn't walked a day in my shoes'

Nugent appears to love the limelight despite being branded a racist whose language would be welcome in Nazi circles

Nugent shied away from most journalists on Tuesday, but seemed to laugh off the idea that Davis would make his views a campaign issue.

'She ought to because she has nothing meaningful to campaign on so she has to be a [Nancy] Pelosi attack dog,' he told a few reporters of Davis and the U.S. House minority leader.

'They're dishonest, anti-American people,' he said.On Tuesday CNN host Wolf Blitzer blasted Nugent on his show 'The Situation Room,' drawing parallels between the outspoken activist's 'subhuman mongrel' language  and Nazis.

'That's what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community,' said Blitzer. 'They called them untermenschen – subhuman mongrels.'

And today's Nazi party, he added, has 'a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States.'

Fact-checkers writing for the Politifact website have backed up Blitzer's claims.
