A hotel set to be built in Peru has been designed to look like a giant, off-center picture frame.

The cliff-hugging structure, designed for a private client by Madrid-based architecture firm OOIIO, will serve as the perfect frame for the Pacific Ocean on one side, and the Andes on the other.

Provisionally named the Unbalanced Hotel, the building is intended to become a landmark for Lima, where it will be built into cliffs outside the city center.

Framed: The hotel will be set into high cliffs above the Pacific Ocean in Peru's capital city, Lima

Uninterrupted: Rather than blocking the ocean view, the hotel serves as a frame for the stunning vista

Plans: The client hasn't yet received approval to construct the unusual structure

The Unbalanced Hotel will have 125 rooms, restaurants, conference rooms and exhibition spaces.

The architects of the hotel say that they chose the unusual frame shape for the hotel because a traditional structure would block the stunning view.

Seaside stay: The hotel will have 125 rooms for guests as well as restaurants and meeting rooms for corporate events

Embedded: The Unbalanced Hotel will be built right into the side of a cliff outside Lima

Innovative: The architecture firm's impression of the inside of the completed hotel

Wide open: The hotel will bring the outdoors in with huge windows and hanging greenery

Monument: The building is intended to be a landmark for Peru's capital city

Original: A view inside on the hotel's proposed 125 guest rooms

A hotel 'constructed in a traditional way would be a visual barrierâ€¦ that could block the ocean view,' according to the OOIIO website.

'Thanks to [the hotel's] peculiar shape, the landscape is now even more relevant - we have framed it!'

The design was commissioned by a private South American client but the plans have yet to be approved by city planners.

Unbalanced: The hotel is shaped like a tilted picture frame

Waterfront: The hotel will be built on prime ocean-front land overlooking the Pacific

The architects' client has been identified only as 'a promoter' and tasked the firm with 'creating a unique, innovative and worldwide recognizable building with a moderate investment.'

'This hotel achieves an extra profitability due to the surprising, interesting and original design,' OOIIO predicts.

This is the second of the innovative Spanish firm's recent proposals for the Peruvian capital,

The first is the planned Miraflores-Barranco pedestrian bridge, the design of which was based on ancient Inca jewelry.
