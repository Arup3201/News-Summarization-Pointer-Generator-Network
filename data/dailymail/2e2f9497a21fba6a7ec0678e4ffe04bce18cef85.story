David Cameron’s favourite curry house has been busted for employing illegal immigrants.

Border officials raided The Shaan restaurant in Witney, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and arrested three Bangladeshi men who will now be deported from the UK.

The restaurant proudly displays a picture of Mr Cameron posing with staff members in its window, and snaps of him dining with his wife and children on its website.

Surprise: The manager of The Shaan said that the arrests had come as a shock to the rest of the staff at the restaurant which has been open since 1999

It also has a picture of his dedication in the visitor’s book. In June 2010, just weeks after the General Election, Mr Cameron wrote: ‘Thank you for a delicious meal - lovely to be back.’

The restaurant is on Corn Street, around the corner from Mr Cameron’s constituency office.Abdul Chowdhury, (corr) the manager of Shaan, said he had checked the documents of the three employees when he interviewed them and thought they were in order.

He said the Camerons gave their compliments to the chef after their last visit before Christmas and promised to return as soon as they had time.

Mr Cameron’s favourite dish at the Shaan was said to be the chicken rogan josh which costs just £5.95. Mrs Cameron had the taaka dhaal for £3 and the total bill came to £55.

Mr Chowdhury said: ‘He really enjoyed his food and said we are his favourite Indian restaurant in the area.

‘We were very pleased to have our Prime Minister in our restaurant.

‘He was kind enough to have his photographer take a picture of him with our staff and sent us six copies in the post.’

He told the Mail the Prime Minister had visited the restaurant three times including on the night of the 2010 poll.

The manager said that the arrests had come as a shock to the rest of the staff at the restaurant which has been open since 1999.

He said: ‘I had interviewed the men and checked their passports and references and thought everything was in order.

‘We will have to wait and see what the UKBA investigation finds.’

The restaurant could now face a fine of up to £10,000 for each illegal worker.

Border officials said one of the men, aged 21, had overstayed his visa while the other two, aged 28 and 35, had entered the country illegally.

The raid took place at 8pm on Friday October 18, as stunned diners looked on.

A Home Office spokesman said the three men were in immigration detention pending their removal from the UK.

Paul Smith, from the Thames Valley and Surrey Home Office immigration enforcement team, said:

‘The message to employers in Oxfordshire who choose to use illegal labour is clear. We will catch you and you will face a heavy penalty.

‘Illegal working has a negative impact on communities. It defrauds the taxpayer, undercuts honest employers and cheats legitimate job seekers out of employment opportunities.

‘I would urge members of the public with information about suspected immigration abuse to get in touch.’

The restaurant has a five star food rating from the local council and offers a ten per cent discount on takeaway orders over £12. A chicken tikka masala costs £6.50.

Restaurant owners have complained of severe shortages of curry chefs as a result of the Government’s tightening of immigration rules.

A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.
