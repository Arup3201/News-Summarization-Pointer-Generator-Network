The BBC could give up its right to broadcast part of the Wimbledon tennis championship under plans being drawn up by senior executives.

In a move that is likely to dismay many tennis fans, coverage of the event may be shared with BT. 

It would mean some matches would only be available to subscribers of the pay-TV channel.

According to The Times, senior BBC executives have held talks with BT but have yet to agree to a deal. The corporation has been Wimbledon’s exclusive broadcaster in the UK for nearly 80 years.

It reportedly costs the BBC up to £40million a year to broadcast - a large part of the tournament’s £150million revenue.

By sharing its rights with BT, the corporation would make significant savings. 

It was also reported that the BBC was considering more cost-cutting measures, including commercial partnerships, as it braces itself for further cuts to its licence fee.

BBC licence fee-payers have long enjoyed Wimbledon free of charge.

Andy Murray’s victory in the Wimbledon men’s final in 2013 drew in the largest number of viewers since at least 1990. A peak of 17.3 million viewers tuned in to BBC One to watch the match.

In recent years, viewers have seen the BBC share its exclusive Formula One rights with BSkyB and lose the French Open to ITV.

It is also thought ITV is preparing to bid for BBC Match of the Day’s right to air highlights of the Premier League football.

The BBC is currently contracted to cover Wimbledon until 2017. The tournament has a protected status under rules drawn up by the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

It means the finals weekend must be freely available on terrestrial television, although other matches may be shown live on pay-TV channels so long as the BBC shows daily highlights.

The BBC last night refused to comment on the deal. A spokesman told the Mail: ‘We never comment on rights.’  BT also declined to comment yesterday. 

The news comes amid reports BBC Sport is set to lose Football League highlights rights to Channel 5.

The Football League is due to announce a three-year deal for all their divisions plus the Capital One Cup, starting from next season, and C5 is understood to have won the contract.

It was thought to have been sealed with an estimated offer of £2million a year and a pledge to screen their show at 9pm on Saturdays.
