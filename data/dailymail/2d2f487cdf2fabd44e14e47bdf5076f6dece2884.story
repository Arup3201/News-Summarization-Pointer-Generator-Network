A popular children's magazine in Tunisia is being prosecuted over an article explaining to its young readers how to make a petrol bomb.

Qaws Quzah magazine - meaning Rainbow in Arabic - now faces charges of inciting violence after its latest issue published a piece on the history of petrol bombs in its 'knowledge corner'.

It also included instructions on how to make a homemade 'Molotov Cocktail' and a diagram in the magazine read by boys and girls aged five to 15.  

How to make a Molotov Cocktail: The Qaws Quzah magazine article on petrol bombs included instructions and a diagram

Popular: Boys and girls aged between five and 15 read the magazine Qaws Quzah

The piece described a Molotov Cocktail as 'an improvised weapon that is often used in riots and acts of sabotage because it is easy to make and use'.

Many were left outraged that the article was published in a children's magazine - particularly in a country still dealing with civil unrest after last year's revolution - the first to spark the Arab Spring.

Tunisia's revolution led to the democratic election of a transitional government headed by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party but there are still many extremist religious groups using violent methods including petrol bombs.

The Ministry for Women and Family Affairs said the article 'encourages violent and terrorist thought' as well as endangering children's lives by "encouraging the use of Molotov cocktails in acts of vandalism or terrorism'.

An investigation has now been launched into the magazine article and a case is likely to be brought against the publishers and all those involved in the issue.

A judge will determine the actual charges the magazine will face but the ministry suggested they could include incitement to violence.
