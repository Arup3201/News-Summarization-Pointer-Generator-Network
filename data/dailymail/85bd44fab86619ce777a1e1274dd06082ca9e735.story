A woman has claimed that a gym asked her to cover up because her toned physique was intimidating other members.

Tiffany Austin, from Richmond, California, said she was looking forward to getting back in shape after recovering from a car crash and headed to Planet Fitness for her first time back on the treadmill.

She said she had checked out the gym - which bans 'gymtimidation' and provides 'judgment free' workout zones - in the Bay Area a week earlier and thought it would be a good fit.

Opposite issue: Tiffany Austin says she was asked to cover up at her California gym by a staff member who said her 'toned body was intimidating others'. She was wearing the same pink pants and top at the time

Not impressed: After being told by two staff members to cover up, she demanded her money back

She donned long pink shorts and a matching spandex top - but 15 minutes after getting on the treadmill, a member of staff stopped her.

'Excuse me, we've had some complaints you're intimidating people with your toned body, can you put on a shirt?' the staff member told her, Austin told KTVU.

Austin agreed to put a shirt over her top but as she waited for an employee to bring her a shirt, a second worker called her out.

Deciding she'd had enough, she asked for the manager and demanded her membership money back before leaving.

Hurt: She said that - although the gym chain claims it doesn't want people to be judged or feel intimidated - she felt judged and intimidated by staff

'I felt intimidated and harassed by the place that says no intimidation,' she said.

Planet Fitness has five million members and prides itself on making members comfortable.

'Members can relax, get in shape, and have fun without 
being subject to the hard-core look-at-me attitude that exists in too 
many gyms,' the company explains on its web site.

The franchise even has a 'lunk alarm' in every gym which sounds if 
someone drops a weight or breathes too hard or shows any behavior that 
staff members consider .lunk-like'.

A company spokesman told KTVU that the gym 'strives to make everyone feel comfortable' and that staff can ask someone to change their attire at their own discretion.
