A 15-year-old boy is being questioned by police over six terrifying sex attacks on women.

The teenager has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting two 18-year-old women in south Manchester in the early hours of Saturday morning.

But Mail Online understands that detectives are also questioning him over a string of other attacks which have sparked alarm in the city over the past three weeks.

Police said the victims of the attacks ranged in age from 17 to 45.

'We have had a great response from the public, both from our appeal for information and from speaking to residents on the ground.

'We are in the early stages of the investigation and inquiries are ongoing and I would urge anyone with information, regardless of how insignificant you think it might be, to contact the police.'
