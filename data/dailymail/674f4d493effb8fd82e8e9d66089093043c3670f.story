If your car happens to be a Honda Accord, now might be a good time to install an alarm.

And a really good one at that.

The familiar family car has been named the most popular vehicle to get stolen as part of a new list released by Forbes magazine.

Some 53,995 Accords of varying models were pinched across America last year, according to data compiled by the National Insurance Crime Board (NCIB) in Des Plaines, Illinois.

Coming a close second was the Honda Civic, of which 45, 001 were stolen, followed by the Chevrolet Silverado (27, 809) and the Ford F-150 (26, 494).

Lock it up: The Honda Accord  is the most stolen car in the U.S., with nearly 54,000 vehicles from various model years taken last year, according to Forbes

Third place: There were 27,809 Chevrolet Silverado's stolen across the US last year

Popular: Some 26, 494 of the Ford F-150 - across all models - were stolen last year

The NCIB also compiled a second list of the most popular 2013 model cars to be stolen last year.

1.) Honda Accord - 53,995

2.) Honda Civic - 45,001

3.) Chevrolet Silverado - 27,809

4.) Ford F-150 - 26,494

5.) Toyota Camry - 14,420

6.) Dodge/Ram Pickup - 11,347

7.) Dodge Caravan - 10,911

8.) Jeep Cherokee - 9,272

9.) Toyota Corolla - 9,010

10.) Nissan Altima - 8,892

Taking out the top spot was the Nissan Altima, with 810 vehicles reported as stolen.

Not far behind was the Ford Fusion (793), the Ford F-150 (775) and the Toyota Corolla (669).

Newer cars are often stolen and then resold with doctored paperwork, however are much harder to break into it.

Conversely, older cars are often easier to access and are dismantled and sold for their parts.

While the figures in the new list appear high, especially in terms of the Honda Accords that were stolen, the FBI says car thefts are actually down.

Although the 2013 numbers have not been completely finalized, they are expecting to a post a 50 percent drop since 1991, when car thefts were at their peak.

They are expecting less than 700,000 cars to have been stolen last year, which is a 3.2 percent improvement on 2012.

Prized: The 2013 Nissan Altima was the most stolen new car last year

The 2013 Ford Motor Co. Fusion was the second most stolen new car last year

Third place: Some 775 models of the 2013 Ford F-150 were stolen last year

Some 669 models of the 2013 Toyota Corolla were stolen last year

According to Forbes, the NCIB has informed car owners to take a 'layered' approach to protecting their vehicles from thieves.

1.) Nissan Altima - 810

2.) Ford Fusion - 793

3.) Ford F-150 - 775

4.) Toyota Corolla - 66

5.) Chevrolet Impala - 654

6.) Hyundai Elantra - 541

7.) Dodge Charger - 536

8.) Chevrolet Malibu - 529

9.) Chevrolet Cruze - 499

10.) Ford Focus - 483

There are everyday precautions such as properly locking the car and never leaving the windows or sunroofs down.

Also, always park in the garage and not on the street.

When parking away from home, try and choose areas that are populous and well-lit.

The NCIB also recommends an antitheft device, even as simple as a steering wheel lock.

Thieves attempt to make off with a car as fast as possible, so small things that will delay them could force them to flee.

Another good deterrent is a hidden ignition kill switch.

It's also suggested that the car or 
truck's vehicle identification number (VIN, often found on the driver's 
side of the dashboard) is etched onto major components, to stop the 
vehicle from being stripped.

'The drop in thefts is good news for all of us,' NICB president and CEO Joe Wehrle told Forbes.

'But it still amounts to a vehicle being stolen every 45 seconds and losses of over $4 billion a year.

'That’s why we applaud the vehicle manufacturers for their efforts to improve anti–theft technology and pledge to continue to work with our insurance company members and law enforcement to identify and seek vigorous prosecution of the organized criminal rings responsible for so many of these thefts.'
