Expensive: Temporary council worker Mike Boyle is raking in a whopping £779 a day at cash-strapped Southend Council in Essex

A temporary council worker is raking in a whopping £779 a day - earning more than both his own chief executive and the Prime Minister.

Mike Boyle has been the interim head of adult commissioning at cash-strapped Southend Council in Essex since 2010.

He remains in post today despite the council claiming it only recruits temporary staff as a stop-gap for vacancies or during periods of reorganisation.

It emerged last week that senior stand-ins at Southend as well as Basildon and Essex County 
Council cost £8million-a-year.

In 2011/12, Mr Boyle would have been paid a staggering £187,154.40 based on his daily rate for 48 weeks - significantly more than council chief executive Rob Tinlin, who was on a basic salary of £148,881, and David Cameron, who is on £145,500.

Mr Boyle, who works five days a week, was even on a higher rate than his current £779-a-day when he worked for the authority briefly in 2007, before he was drafted back three years later.

Council leader Nigel Holdcroft said Mr Boyle was in post because the authority had been unable to find a permanent head of adult commissioning since 2010.

Mr Tinlin said: 'When the post became vacant again 2010, we were unable to recruit to this position so Mike returned to fill the post in the interim, from June 2010 at a reduced rate of pay.

'Over the period Mike has been acting for the council, this and other posts have been filled on temporary arrangements to facilitate service reviews and a review of the senior management structure.'

Southend Council would not say what Mr Boyle's original daily rate was before it was scaled back, but a slice of it will be paid to a recruitment agency, who provided My Boyle.

Opposition leaders have called on the council to make better use of its money particularly as its budget is set to be slashed by the Government later this year while unions say 90 jobs are at risk.

Martin Terry, leader of the opposition independent party, said: 'We are looking at more cuts this year and when you set that against the backdrop of these huge salaries it makes me angry.

'The council should be looking at training and using some of their existing staff to temporary fill in rather than bringing in staff at a ridiculous cost to the taxpayer.'

Graham Longley, leader of the Liberal Democrat Group in Southend, said: 'Interim staff is quite acceptable providing they are temporary and once they go beyond what is a reasonable timeframe for a temporary member of staff, they should not be in post.

'I'm surprised no-one has picked up on the fact that Mr Boyle has been in his role so long in terms of his temporary contract.'

Interim members of staff are not entitled to pensions or holiday and sick pay, and Southend Council claims that it has reduced its numbers of temporary staff over the past few years.

The council says Mr Boyle has played a major role in shaping council policy during his time in Southend. 

Since returning to the authority in 2010, he has taken the lead in a number of projects which have taken months and even years to reach fruition.

Nigel Holdcroft, leader of Southend Council, defended the authority.

He said: 'When we employ interims they have always been for a good reason, either because we have been unable to find a suitable appointment or where we anticipate that there is likely to be a reconstructuring of areas of the council.

'Councils are under financial pressure and on occasion it's in the financial best interests to fill a post with an interim because it gives us greater flexibility.

'We can only appoint somebody full-time if we can find the right person to fill the role and we are confident that role is going to be retained in any future organisation.

'We go through great lengths to ensure the number of interim staff is kept to an absolute minimum and when they are appointed it is for a good reason and that reason is discussed by senior staff at the council.'

At Basildon Council, one executive director who remains in a job is 
paid £565-a-day and was among seven other staff who earned more than 
£300 a day. They were all hired through agencies.

One interim executive director has been in post since August 2011 and is not due to leave until April 2013.

In total, Basildon Council spent £501,000 on temporary staff in 2011-12,
while Southend's seven temporary employees cost a total of £330,000.

Essex County Council, which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009, 
employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million.  Two of the temps were 
paid more than £900-a-day.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said last week: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff.

‘Temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term, but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money.

‘Councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money.’

Mr Boyle has declined to comment.
