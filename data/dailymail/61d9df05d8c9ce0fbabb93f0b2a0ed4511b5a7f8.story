Good Morning America meteorologist Ginger Zee has married her fellow television presenter fiance Ben Aaron in a beachfront wedding in her home state of Michigan.

The TV-friendly couple are based in New York and Aaron works for the local NBC affiliate but they decided to wed on the shores of Lake Michigan because that is where she went every summer while growing up.

Given her focus on weather at work, it only seemed fitting that the couple tied the knot on a perfect day.

'The weather could not have been more perfect. Mid 70s and high clouds, I couldn’t have written it better,' she said.

Match made for TV: Ginger Zee, 33, married Ben Aaron, 32, on Saturday at the Inn at Bay Harbor in Petoskey, Michigan

Weather friendly: Zee was thrilled that it was in the mid-70s with high clouds when they got married

Emotional: Aaron said that he has been thinking about the vows he was going to write ever since he proposed to her in front of the fountain at Lincoln Center, where they had their first kiss

Second set of vows: The pair first had a private vows ceremony and then later held another ceremony in front of 55 friends and relatives while overlooking Lake Michigan

'She has a direct line to Zeus himself,' her new husband joked to MLive.com.

'She called him up and said "Hey Z", she calls him that, it’s a thing they have in common, and she said "I want beautiful weather this weekend" and it was.'

The low cloud covering made for great light for the photos shot by Michael Murphy and for her part, Zee felt the beautiful day was karmic payback for her years of service in the field.

'It’s a rough time of the year in Northern Michigan. (The weather) can be anything. But I figure I’ve treated weather pretty well my whole life — I think it can give me one day,' she told The Chicago Sun-Times ahead of their Saturday ceremony.

Traditional touches: Zee said that she would not have expected to like a lace dress but is thrilled with her pick

Family roots: The New York-based couple decided to get married near Lake Michigan because that is where she spent summers with her family growing up

They exchanged their personal 'I dos' in a private vows ceremony and then held a second, more traditional ceremony outside in a circle of rosepetals overlooking the Lake, in front of their 55 guests.

'I’m not joking. Since I knew I was marrying Ginger, I’ve been writing the vows in my head. So every time I thought about it I started crying. We’d be walking and I’d have to turn my head and blame it on allergies I don’t even have,' Aaron told MLive.

He wasn't the only one in tears.

'I thought I was done crying after the 
private vows but then walking down the aisle I saw my aunt and her face 
and it was like the vomit scene in The Goonies. It was totally 
contagious,' she said.

Party time: Aaron, who does playful segments on NBC New York, and his new bride let loose on the dancefloor

Showing some skin: Ginger's back was bare as she previously described how the lace dress had modern, sexy touches

She opted for a fitted lace dress with straps had some more traditional touches than she expected to like.

'I
 didn’t think I wanted (lace) at all. I’d say it’s traditional in some 
senses but with major modern twists— so major I know that at some point 
in my life I will say, "Whoa, that was a bold choice." I want it to be 
very sexy,' she told The Sun-Times.

She
 decided to go a little more playful with her footwear, however, wearing
 two different pairs of shoes throughout the ceremony and reception, the
 second of which were blue with clouds that had 'love' written in them 
and a rainbow on the sole.

Thematic: One of the two pairs of shoes Zee wore on the big day had clouds and a rhinestone rainbow on the sole

Intimate: The GMA weather correspondent shared this photo of 'the final touches for our private vows'

'it¿s traditional in some senses but with major modern twists¿ so major I know that at some point in my life I will say, "Whoa, that was a bold choice." I want it to be very sexy,' she said of her Pnina Tornai gown

Next adventure: The pair said that they are excited to start a family that includes both adopted and biological children

She has also chosen to adopt her husband's last name, and name-changes are not new to the broadcast couple as they have both changed their last names before for the sake of their careers.

Zee was born Ginger Zuidgeest and Aaron was born Ben Colonomos.

The public won't notice a difference as Zee will be keeping her name professionally but will go by Mrs Colonomos at home.
