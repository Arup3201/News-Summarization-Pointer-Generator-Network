Desperate villagers in an Indian region hit by droughts have held a wedding ceremony for frogs in a bid to appease rain gods. 

The amphibian ritual took place in the village of Dibrugarh in the north eastern Indian state of Assam.

Villagers perform the ceremony to try and bring rainfall during dry spells.

Ranjan Das, one of village leaders who attended the wedding, said: 'Our region had not witnessed much rain this year so far. 

'So we arranged the wedding of two frogs to please the rain Gods.' 

The ritual began by catching hold of a male and a female frog from two different villages.

'We have to make sure that the frogs have been brought from two different villages. Only then will the rain Gods accept our plea,' said Das.

After the ceremony was over, the frogs were taken to a small pond nearby and let go. Villagers then proceeded to eat dinner, where more than 900 plates of food were served.

'We let the frogs go, so that they can live their life and convey our message to the rain Gods,' added Gogoi

'This ritual is performed as a last resort measure. And thanks to God, our wishes come true,' said Gogoi.

It seems the prayers of the villagers were answered - it began raining across Dibrugarh this morning.
