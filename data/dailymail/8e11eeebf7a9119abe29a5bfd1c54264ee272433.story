The magnitude 4.4 earthquake that rolled through Southern California on Monday morning could mark the beginning of the end for L.A.'s years-long ‘earthquake drought,’ warn experts.

The tremor that struck near Westwood at 6:25 a.m. is the most significant shake in Southern California since a 5.5 earthquake hit Chino Hills in 2008.

Earthquakes were far more common in the Los Angeles Basin the 1980s and the 1990s, but have been less so in recent years.

Seismology experts such as Egill Hauksson of Caltech believe that Monday morning's earthquake could mark the beginning of the end for L.A.'s years-long 'earthquake drought'

‘We don’t know if this is the end of the earthquake drought we’ve had over the last few years, and we won’t know for many months,’ Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson told the LA Times.

There were at least six aftershocks in the hours that immediately followed the 6:25 a.m. earthquake, with the largest was a magnitude 2.7 earthquake that struck five miles northwest of Westwood.

U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Robert Graves told reporters on Monday morning that there was a possibility that the quake was just a prelude to an equal or stronger one.

‘There’s always the possibility that it’s a foreshock,’ said Graves.

About five percent of earthquakes are followed by an equal or larger shake which, if it does happen, typically occurs within the next couple of hours.

As it happens: Anchors Megan Henderson and Chris Schauble took cover under their desk on air as the quake hit during morning news

Startling: The quake was clearly felt quite strongly in the Hollywood KTLA studios, but no damage was reported

Los Angeles police and fire officials said there were no immediate reports of damage.

Broadcasters
 live on the air immediately announced that an earthquake was occurring.
 Anchors at KTLA-TV took cover underneath their desk before quickly 
resuming the broadcast by seeking USGS information.

'We're having an earthquake!' exclaims anchor Chris Schauble as he and co-anchor Megan Henderson dive under their desk.

It was over almost as quickly as it had begun, but a quick cut to a KTLA correspondent in the field a few miles away revealed he'd felt it, too.

'It
 was a definite jolt, just one single jolt and I haven't seen the 
magnitude,' said Eric Spillman. 'But it definitely something we could 
feel here in downtown.'

Seismologists
 at the USGS have not yet determined exactly what fault this earthquake 
was on and Graves also said ‘we’re continuing to analyze the data, but 
at this point, this seems to be what I would call a rather typical 
earthquake.’

Exactly what they're supposed to do: When experiencing an earthquake while indoors, experts recommend you get under a desk or table if at all possible. If there is no available desk or table, you should stand against an interior wall

It was one of the largest to hit Los 
Angeles since the 6.7-magnitude Northridge quake killed several dozen 
people and caused $25 billion in damage two decades ago, USGS 
seismologist Lucy Jones told KABC-TV.

'It's
 not that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have
 across the state once every couple of months,' Jones said. 'But we 
haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.'

The quake was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center and occurred at a depth of about 5 miles.

'It
 felt like a bomb going off underneath our house,' said George McQuade, a
 West Hills resident. 'Nothing was damaged, but it sure woke everyone 
up. It was an eye-opener.'

The epicenter was 6 miles from Beverly Hills, 7 miles from Universal City and 7 miles from Santa Monica, the USGS said.

Did you feel it? The USGS says the 4.4 quake struck about 6 miles from Beverly Hills at a depth of 5 miles. It could be felt from the San Fernando Valley to Long Beach

Meanwhile, Chile’s northern Pacific shore was rocked by a 6.2-magnitude earthquake  just hours after a stronger 6.7-magnitude quake hit the same region.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has no tsunami warning in effect.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports that this latest quake hit late on Sunday night.

The USGS report says the earthquake 
occurred offshore at a depth of 6.6 miles. Its epicenter was 46 miles 
northwest of Iquique, Chile.

The region has had a series of strong shocks since the quake earlier Sunday, registering between 4.9 and 5.2 magnitude.

The
 earlier quake caused more than 100,000 people to briefly evacuate some 
coastal areas as a precaution. Minor damage was reported.

Chile is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.
