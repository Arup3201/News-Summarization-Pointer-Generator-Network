England have reached the World Cup after beating Poland 2-0 in last night's crucial qualifier.

Goals by Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard booked England's place at Brazil 2014.

There were fears about the impact the 20,000 vociferous Poland fans at Wembley would have on the match. 

But England ensured qualification by finishing top of Group H and in doing so, Roy Hodgson has become only the sixth manager to take the side into a World Cup finals.

The charged atmosphere inside the stadium before kick-off lived up to expectations as the travelling supporters made their voices heard.

Dozens of fans lit flares in the away end causing smoke to billow onto the pitch during the national anthems.

God Save the Queen was loudly booed and every England touch was greeted with loud whistles from the noisy Polish contingent.

Questions have already been asked about how the Polish fans were able to get flares into the stadium, with many people voicing their anger on Twitter. 

They are listed on the banned items list on the Wembley website and fans seen with them are supposed to be ejected from the ground.

Rival fans had mostly been separated inside the stadium amid fears of trouble.

However, there were no reports of incidents between the two groups of supporters in the hours before kick-off.

The
FA had controversially offered Polish fans 18,000 tickets for the 
fixture and some seats in the home end were snapped up by enthusiastic 
Poles.

There was a poignant 
moment during the game when a giant flag was unveiled to commemorate the
role Polish pilots played in the Battle of Britain.

England played well in the first half and their attacking approach was rewarded when Wayne Rooney headed his side in front.

His protective headband that he has worn since suffering a nasty injury during training last month fell off as he scored.

However,
the next half an hour was nervy for home fans who knew an equaliser by 
Poland would send England into second place in Group H.

But Steven Gerrard secured England's progression with an 87th minute goal.

Manager Roy Hodgson, who lived every 
minute of the match, leapt to the air in jubilation, becoming only the 
sixth Englishman to take his country into a World Cup finals.

Hodgson
joins an illustrious list, including Walter Winterbottom, Sir Alf 
Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson and Glenn Hoddle, and can now look 
ahead to December's draw knowing the minimum task for his tenure has 
been achieved.

When Gerrard's goal went in Hodgson danced a jig while assistant Ray Lewington sprinted down the touchline.

Hodgson will now take England to a second major tournament having led them at Euro 2012, taking the job on the eve of the event.

He felt this qualification was a reward for getting better as time went on, as well as the fitness and performances of his players, both old and new.

'I think we have been getting better all the time,' he added.

'The results that spoiled, so it's not
an unblemished record, are the away games we only drew. But we knew we 
had these games, were coming strong, had players coming back from 
injury.

'We have also found an outstanding winger in (Andros) Townsend who has played two games as if he's been there all his life.

'When
you perform that well in front of 90,000 everyone will look. It's when 
he's not outstanding that people will ask 'what's happened to Andros 
Townsend' but he will deal with that.'

England were disappointing at the Euros last year, but Hodgson is confident of a better showing by the beaches of Brazil.

'I'd
like to think we will do a lot better,' he said. 'We have been working 
together for 18 months, the way we try and play has changed quite a lot 
and I would like to think in the months we have we might get better 
still.

'We need to keep the players together and as a group they really care.'

Rooney
told ITV after the match: 'We knew it was going to be a tough game, 
they had a couple of breaks and could have scored, but we played some 
great stuff in the first and second half.

'Getting the goal gave us some belief, the confidence to go on. We believed we could win and then Stevie's goal has seen us qualify.'

Gerrard added: 'Tonight we started really well. The big lesson is to play better in the second half. Against better teams we might get hurt. We need to keep the ball better.'

Following the final whistle, Chelsea left-back Ashely Cole, who was out through injury today, tweeted: 'Well done lads!!! never a doubt!' 

Legendary England goalkeeper David Seaman wrote: 'Congratualtions to the lads, the manager and all his staff!!!!'
