Defeat: Eureka Naturist Spa Club, pictured, has  to remove eight static caravans for 'sleepovers'

A naturist club which is popular with swingers has been ordered to remove caravans used for 'sleepovers' by nudist guests after neighbours complained that those staying in them were making too much noise.

Eureka Naturist Spa Club, in the sleepy Kent village of Fawkham, currently has eight static caravans which it hires out for £50 a night to nudists visiting from around the UK and Europe.

But now the local council has ruled that the structures were put up without planning permission and must be removed.

The club, which holds weekly parties attended with local swingers, is situated on 23 acres of land in the grounds of Pennis Wood.

As well as the party nights, Eureka - founded in 1967 - offers visitors naked wrestling, swimming in a heated pool, body painting, badminton, football and nude rambling in the forest.

The club also has two eight-person jacuzzis, a sauna and a steam room, while its party room contains a dance floor and space for 180 people at its 'exciting and hedonistic' parties.

Guests are told they can strip naked as soon as they reach the car park, as the club is officially 'clothing-optional'.

But Lawrence Moss, the chair of Fawkham Parish Council, said that the club's caravans were a major 'noise nuisance' problem for neighbours.

'Because the parties go on to the early hours, there's considerable potential for people living nearby to have problems,' he said.

'There have been complaints of excess noise and passers-by being exposed to naked people.'

The parish council complained that the accommodation was 'out of character' for the area, and last week Sevenoaks District Council ruled that they should be removed.

Chief planning officer Richard Morris said the caravans constituted an 'inappropriate development in the Green Belt', adding that they 'detracted from the rural setting and natural character of the ancient woodland'.

Local Simon Sullivan said: 'The nudist club has been here for years and there aren't too many problems really, although it's a bit of a shock when you meet a bunch of naked people wandering around the woods.

'I think it's a case of each to their own, but some people in the village get quite annoyed about the noise and when people stay over obviously the noise goes on a bit longer. I dare say the caravans are rocking all night, but I've never been invited!'

The club's boss Michael Davies admitted the caravans did not have planning permission, but said they had been in place for more than 20 years without any problems.

He added: 'We just want to keep the static caravans for our members to stay in rather than having to drive home.

'It's a niche market so we get people coming from all over the place - from Portsmouth, Norfolk, Scotland, even France and Holland.'

A spokesman for the club said it would appeal against the decision, adding: 'The club has a number of members who travel long distances to attend meetings and events held by the club, and small-scale provision of overnight accommodation allows members to relax and enjoy an alcoholic drink without any concerns of irresponsible late-night travelling.'
