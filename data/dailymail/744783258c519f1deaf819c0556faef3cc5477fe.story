A teenager was left blind in one eye when she stepped in to stop a violent thug from attacking her friends with a broken wine bottle.

Megan Kerrigan took the full force of the jagged glass in her face when Andrew  Wyness lashed out in the street in South Shields, South Tyneside, on March 17.

The 17-year-old was left with devastating damage to her left eye, which her doctor said was the 'most severe injury' he had ever seen in a young woman.

From happiness to depression: Megan Kerrigan, 17, has been left depressed about her looks after being hit in the face with a broken bottle on a night out. It is feared that the scarring and vision problems caused by the attack could last for life. Megan is pictured here (left) before the attack and (right) as she is now

She has been left scarred for life and has lost two thirds of the coloured iris  of her left eye.Medics managed to save her eye but she is unlikely to ever regain her full  sight.

At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday Wyness, 23, of Bradford Avenue,  Sunderland, who has multiple previous convictions for violence and even cruelty to an animal, was jailed for 10 years with a four-year extended licence period.

Judge Penny Moreland told him: 'You do pose a significant risk of causing harm  because of your previous convictions and because of the nature of this offence.

'You used a jagged bottle as a weapon against a 17-year-old girl who was  unarmed.

'Nothing she did that night begins to justify what you did to her.

'The consequences of what you did to her are appalling.

'She has to live with all that for the rest of her life.'

Impact: Miss Kerrigan said the scarring left by the attack has completely undermined her confidence in the way she looks. She no longer wants to go out and socialise with her friends

Megan said in her victim statement the attack has made her completely  re-evaluate her life and that she will live with what happened forever.

'I find myself crying most of the time. It makes me feel ugly,' she said.

'I am going to have to carry this for the rest of my life.

'When you have had sight all of your life and then it's lost it's heartbreaking.

'I had beautiful eyes. I used to take pride and use make-up to accentuate the  look of my eyes. I am not sure if I ever will do again.

'I feel very conscious of people staring at me, children stare.

Miss Kerrigan said her self esteem has dropped lower and lower since the attack.

'It will live with me forever,' she said.

'It has affected my life and I am sure you will understand it has affected my  parents’ too.

'I used to be outgoing, full of confidence, [But] I am struggling to get back to where I was before.'

Thug: Andrew Wyness, 23, (pictured) from Sunderland, was jailed for 10 years at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday after smashing a broken wine bottle into Miss Kerrigan's face

Megan had been out with friends on the night of the attack when they walked past Wyness and  his friends at Wenlock Road, in South Shields.

Trouble flared between the groups and Wyness headed to a nearby shop to arm  himself with bottles.

CCTV footage shows Megan confronting Wyness in the shop in a bid to stop him  taking the weapons outside.

But he smashes a wine bottle on the floor and storms into the street.

Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'She describes trying to stop the  defendant, clearly she was concerned he was going to use the bottle against her  friends.

'She stepped in his way.

'He then punched her in the face with his left hand then immediately hit her with his right hand which was holding the bottle.

'She was hit in the face and she fell to the floor.

'She describes blood everywhere, all over her face. She was in shock and she started screaming.

'She was very frightened.'Miss Kerrigan was taken to hospital where a cut to her right eye was stitched.

Her left eye had suffered extensive bruising, swelling and haemorraging and she needed surgery to repair the damage.

Mr Pallister said: 'It seems likely the eye will be retained but it is far too soon to predict what level of vision there might be in future.'

Medics hope Megan’s injured eye can be fitted with a special lens which will improve her vision in future but she remains at risk of further complications to both her eyes.

Jamie Adams, defending, said Wyness, who admitted wounding with intent, was inconsolable when he was told of the extent of the injury he had caused.

Mr Adams read an extract of a letter Wyness had sent to the judge in which he expressed his regret and remorse for what he did.

It said: 'I was shocked and sickened and still am now.

'I don’t think this feeling will ever go away.

'It must be horrible for Megan and the people that love her to go through something like this.

'I wish I could go back and change everything.

'I don’t like what I’ve done, I don’t want to go through life hurting people, I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again.'

Pretty: Miss Kerrigan (again pictured here on holiday before the attack) said she has been left feeling 'ugly' because of the injuries she suffered

Speaking after the court case, Miss Kerrigan's dad Alex, 48, a carer, of South Shields, said it has been a gruelling six months for his daughter.

He said: 'The mirror is her worst enemy now. She had absolutely beautiful eyes.

'We’re happy with the sentence and hope it goes to highlight the problem the problem of knife crime and bottle attacks in this country.

'She has to live with this for the rest of her life.'

After the sentencing, Miss Kerrigan, now 18, said: 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

She said she thought Wyness had taken her eye out with the bottle after she was hit.

'All I could see was bright red,' she said.

'I just passed out and the next thing I knew I was on the operating table.'

Since the attack, the teenager says she has been left feeling too depressed and self conscious to go out socialising.

She said: 'I just feel very depressed all the time about my looks.

'I don’t go out with my friends anymore.'
