A row erupted over the future of Britain’s nuclear deterrent yesterday.

Tories and Lib Dems clashed over whether to build a new generation of Trident submarines.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced contracts worth £350million to design the boats now based at the Scottish naval complex of Faslane – an apparent bid to show voters in Scotland what they would be losing if they vote for independence.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg angrily denounced the move as ‘jumping the gun’, since the main decision to proceed will not have to be taken until 2016.

David Cameron made clear last week that he favours retention of the present continuous sea deterrent involving four nuclear-powered submarines.

But the Lib Dems have set up a review to find a cheaper alternative, which could see them recommend a reduction in the Trident fleet, a move to short-range missiles on an existing submarine or a move to air-launched nuclear missiles.

That is regarded by Tories and senior Royal Navy figures as a cut-price solution that would end Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent and undermine national security.

The Tories estimate the cost of replacing Trident at £20billion, but the Lib Dems warn it may cost £50billion.

Despite knowing about the announcement since last week, Lib Dems expressed dismay that the Defence Secretary had chosen to depict the awarding of the contracts as a key stage towards renewing Trident.

Mr Clegg said: ‘I think some people are jumping the gun on this. The final decision on Trident replacement will not be taken until 2016, however much other people may not like it that way.

‘The idea of a like-for-like entirely unchanged replacement of Trident is basically saying we will spend billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system designed with the sole strategic purpose of flattening Moscow at the press of  a button.’

The row spread confusion about the policy.

A Downing Street spokesman first said that the Government’s policy was ‘unchanged’ and that ‘we’re still committed to that at-sea nuclear deterrent’.

But she later said the Lib Dem review ‘will inform’ the Government’s plans. However sources said Mr Cameron has ‘no intention’ of changing his mind.

The row overshadowed attempts by Mr Hammond to make political capital out of his announcement in Scotland, where the SNP government has said it wants to abolish the nuclear deterrent.

The Defence Secretary said that the investment would help secure 6,500 jobs on the Clyde but SNP leader Alex Salmond claims only 520 are directly dependent on the nuclear facilities.

In a bid to drum up votes in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, Mr Hammond said he intends to move more submarines based in England to Faslane.

He added: ‘Right now there are 3,200 civilian jobs on this base, as well as many thousands of military jobs, and that number will increase as we go through the decade.’

But Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon attacked the UK Government for ‘dumping’ weapons of mass destruction on Scotland and said that an independent parliament would use its share of Trident cash on public services.

The Lib Dems have expressed interest in mounting nuclear warheads on cruise missiles fired from Astute class hunter killer submarines.

But a senior Navy official told the Mail that each of the alternative policies is implausible if the UK wants to maintain a credible deterrent.

Only the UK, the US, Russia and France can deploy submarines anywhere in the world unseen and capable of delivering missiles over a range of more than 7,000 miles.

The source said: ‘Astute class submarines are designed for an entirely different purpose. Range would be reduced to hundreds of miles rather than many thousands.
