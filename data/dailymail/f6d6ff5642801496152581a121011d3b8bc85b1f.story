He's a top footballer with Hamburg, but Maxi Beister has more than just good ball skills, it seems. 

The midfielder has turned inventor, designing a combination beaker and bowl to help stop excitable football fans spilling food or drink while they are watching him on the pitch.

Sportsman Biester dreamed up the double act - called the Maxicup - three years ago while he was trying to juggle a cup of Coke and a bowl of snacks during a trip to the cinema.

The 24-year-old footballer demonstrates that he has more than just good ball skills with his new invention 

He said: 'I thought there has to be a better way than this and one of my friends said, ''Why don't you invent one then?"'.

The 24-year-old Hamburg star added: 'I thought about it for a few minutes and then I decided that's exactly what I'll do. I'll make it myself.'

Beister's new Maxicup carries a drink in a supersize cup while the attached bowl not only carries the snacks but also seals the top of the cup, too.

He explained: 'It means you can carry everything in one hand without spilling anything at all.'

This weekend 4,000 prototype cups were distributed at Hamburg's Imtech Arena stadium in the northern German city on Sunday during their match against Mainz.

Beister said ahead of the handout: 'We'll be giving away free cups and food so we'll see just how the fans like them. In my experience, football fans are very vocal and soon let you know if you've got it wrong.'

The soccer star's new Future Cup company is planning to trial the Maxicup at cinemas as well.

Beister added: 'I'm very hopeful. It makes a change from football and I've got a good feeling about it.'
