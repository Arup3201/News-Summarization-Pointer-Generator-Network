Senator Marco Rubio has branded Barack Obama's apology to an art history professor 'pathetic' after the President personally wrote a note saying he regretted denigrating the subject.

The Republican senator for Florida took to Twitter to issue a condemnation of Mr Obama's climbdown, saying 'we do need more degrees that lead to #jobs'.

It came after Mr Obama hand wrote an apology to University of Texas professor Ann Collins Johns for suggesting learning a trade would be a better career choice than studying for an art history degree.

'Pathetic': Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, has criticised Barack Obama for his apology to an art history professor after he glibly said that studying the subject was not as good as learning a trade

Senator Rubio's tweet: The high-flying Republican rarely misses an chance to cock a snook at the President

During a speech at a General Electric plant in Wisconsin, he said that 'folks can make a lot more potentially with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree.'

He was inundated with letters from art historians and journalists all furious at his remarks - but it was Professor Johns' comments that caught his eye.

The University of Texas professor Ann Collins Johns sent a message to the president via the White House website, Politico reported.

She argued that art history teaches students how to think, read and write critically, while also praising how inclusive the subject is.

And in response, Obama wrote to clarify that he was making a point about the jobs market, rather than commenting on the value of the subject, according to the Huffington Post.

He also wrote that art history had been invaluable in teaching him to appreciate works of art.

But it appears that Mr Rubio, a 
leading light in the Republican party who has been tipped as a possible 
future presidential contender, vehemently disagreed.

His
 tweet, posted last night, read, 'Pathetic Obama apology to art history prof. We do need 
more degrees that lead to #jobs,' before ending with a link to a news 
story reporting on the President's note.

Professor Johns told blog Hyperallegic
 that the content of her email: 'was not so much one of outrage at his 
statement, but rather a "look at what we do well" statement.

'I
 emphasized that we challenge students to think, read, and write 
critically. I also stressed how inclusive our discipline is these days.'

'Ann,

'Let me apologize for my off-the-cuff remarks. I was making a point about the jobs market, not the value of art history.

'As
 it so happens, art history was one of my favorite subjects in high 
school, and it has helped me take in a great deal of joy in my life that
 I might otherwise have missed.'

He
 explained that he was merely trying to inspire students to consider a 
path other than college, if it suit them better than struggling at 
college.

He wrote: 'So 
please pass on my apology for the glib remark to the entire department, 
and understand that I was trying to encourage young people who may not 
be predisposed to a four year college experience to be open to technical
 training that can lead them to an honorable career.'

In a letter published on the blog Hyperallergic, Obama wrote: 'Ann, Let me apologize for my off-the-cuff remarks. I was making a point about the jobs market, not the value of art history.

'There's nothing wrong with art history, I love art history,' Obama immediately said after making the comment about art history degrees.

'So, I don't want to get a bunch of emails from everybody.

'I'm just saying, you can make a really good living and have a great career without getting a four-year college education, as long as you get the skills and training that you need.'

Afterwards Johns wrote that she was a supporter of the President, and believed he had done a great job in extremely challenging circumstances.

His comments came after his State of the Union speech.

He outlined a series of actions he plans to take by himself to help America's employment conditions.

They include a Government-wide review of job training programs, CEO roundtable, and 'mobilizing' businesses and community colleges to create apprenticeships.

He also plans to stimulate the economy by introducing a new $10.10 minimum wage for federal contract workers, new 'starter' retirement savings accounts and effort to bring jobs to the U.S. from overseas.
