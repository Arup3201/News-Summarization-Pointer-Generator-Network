Gray said his life had been 'ruined' by the incident

A detective sergeant raped a mother in
 her own home after forcing her front door open when she turned him down
 following a date, a court heard today.

Trevor
 Gray, 49, is accused of breaking the security chain before attacking 
the 43-year-old woman in her bed while her children slept in a nearby 
room.

A court heard the pair
 had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre on a Saturday night 
in July, 2011 before going back to her house in a taxi in the early 
hours of the next day.

Gray,
 who was an off-duty officer with Nottinghamshire Police at the time, 
left the home when the woman asked him to go and said he was going to 
try and get a taxi up the road.

The
 court heard that Gray returned to the house when he couldn't hail a 
taxi and forced his way in because he was worried something had happened
 to her as she wasn't answering his calls.

But
 Birmingham Crown Court also heard he sent her a text message saying 
'you are harsh' before forcing his way back in just minutes later.

A
 jury of nine men and three women were told the next memory the victim 
has was of Gray, who was off duty at the time, being naked on top of her
 in her bed raping her.

The woman told officers she remembered waking up the next day and challenging Gray about the broken door chain and how he had got into her house.

Gray left after the woman called him a taxi and the next day she spoke to her friend, who was also a serving police officer, who reported the matter to her superiors.

Gray, of Watnall, pictured at court with his ex-wife Alison, denies a charge of rape, attempted rape and another of sexual assault

When the father-of-two was arrested he
 admitted he had sex with the victim but claimed he did it after she 
asked him to, the court heard.

Giving evidence today, Detective Sergeant Justine Wilson told the court that the woman told her she believed Gray had raped her.

She said: 'They had arranged to go out on
 Saturday July 23. They met in Nottingham city centre and had gone to 
several bars together.

Gray claims he returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi and said he had forced the door because he was concerned something might have happened to her when she ignored his calls

'She said initially she had been drinking wine and in the last bar she felt drunk so asked for a vodka and coke. Mr Gray returned from the bar and stated he had bought her a double.

'She recalls being in the taxi with Mr Gray and returning to her home address. Having gone inside she paid her babysitter.

'After the babysitter left she said she didn’t feel well and said she was going to bed.

'She doesn’t remember Mr Gray leaving the house at all but feels he must have from the texts and missed calls she had.

'The next thing she remembers is being in bed naked and she was woken by receiving text messages from Mr Gray.

'Then she said she was awoken by the noise of the door-bell being rang several times which she ignored.

'She remembers Mr Gray being in bed with her. She was on her front and Mr Gray was on top of her. She then remembers Mr Gray attempting or actually penetrating her.

'She didn’t know whether he had worn a condom or had ejaculated. She woke up (in the morning) Mr Gray was next to her.

'She went downstairs and attended to her children. Mr Gray came downstairs and she made him a cup of coffee.

'She then said she was busy and that he had to go so she called a taxi for him and at that point he left.'

The court heard Gray claimed in police interviews he had returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi and said he had forced the door with 'bodily pressure' because he was concerned something might have happened to her when she had ignored his calls.

The jury heard Gray was found
 guilty of the rape at an earlier trial at Derby Crown Court and spent 
13 months in prison, but had the conviction quashed by the Court of 
Appeal.

Trevor Gray’s 
barrister Michael Wolkind said the conviction was quashed because it was
 deemed 'unsafe' after a taxi driver who picked him up came forward as a
 new witness.

The Court of Appeal overturned his conviction in July last year after he was jailed for eight years and ordered a retrial.

Giving
 evidence Gray said his life had been 'ruined' by the incident and said 
he had been dismissed by Nottinghamshire Police after the original 
guilty verdict.

Gray, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire, denies a charge of rape, attempted rape and another of sexual assault.

He said: 'I did not (rape the victim). The sexual activities were consensual. She agreed to everything, she initiated everything.

'It was her suggestion to go back to her house. I was on a date, I had no expectations.

'She gave me a tour of the house, she was obviously very proud of the house, it was new.

'We went back to the lounge and we sat on the settee cuddling and kissing. She suddenly said it’s probably time to go, I went to the door, we kissed and I went.'

Speaking about when he returned to the house after failing to flag down a taxi, Gray added: 'I rang her phone, I send her another text asking her to get me a cab, again there was no response.

'I rang a couple more times and got no response. At that point I felt there was clearly something wrong. I walked back down towards the house.

'I could see the lights were on. I could see the door was ajar.

'My levels of concern were getting higher and higher. I repeatedly rang the doorbell with no response. I shouted through the door with no response.

'Then I made a decision to enter the premises. I used my hands on the door and pushed it open snapping the chain.

'She was sitting up in bed. I explained to her that I had been concerned about her. I then asked her if she could get me a taxi.

'She said ‘you might as well stay now’. Everything was absolutely fine.

'I removed my clothing, used the toilet then I got in to the bed. I was lying in the bed, I turned away from her and after a few minutes I felt her arm come across me. I turned inwards and we started to kiss.

'The (police) investigation which put me in prison was a poor investigation. My life has been ruined. I’ve been put in prison for 13 months for something I didn’t do.'

The trial continues.
