A retired holiday camp entertainer who is Britain's most married man having tied the knot a whopping eight times is set to celebrate his tenth wedding anniversary.

Ron Sheppard, 66, from Martock, Somerset, first walked down the aisle 47 years ago and has since married eight times, had eight children and welcomed 13 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

However, despite being keen in the past to re-marry, Mr Sheppard is now happier than ever and promises his latest wife, 35-year-old Filipino Weng Platino, will be his last.

Ron Sheppard, 66, from Somerset, who first walked down the aisle 47 years ago, has been married to his eighth wife, 35-year-old Filipino Weng Platino (together left today and right on their wedding day), for ten years

The couple are celebrating ten years of marriage, which is the second longest partnership for Mr Sheppard

He said: 'We've made it to double figures. It's my second longest marriage, but the first one wasn't a real marriage - it wasn't like this.

'We love each other so much. As each year goes on we love each other more and more. 

'We just do everything together, it's how love should be.'

Mr Sheppard, who has written a book on his life and is set to have a film made about him, has married eight women since his first ceremony aged 19 in 1966.

He tied the knot with first wife Margaret 47 years ago and the pair had two children together before divorcing two years later. 

He then met second wife Jeanette and they wed in 1973, but it only lasted one year and Mr Sheppard has since described the marriage as a 'business transaction' which enabled them to receive a bigger house from the council.

Shortly after their divorce, Mr Sheppard met third wife Lesley and in 1976 they tied the knot. They went on to have two children together and he said he thought she 'was for keeps', but he left five years later following a string of arguments.

He went on to meet 18-year-old blonde Kathy at Pontins holiday camp in Somerset and the pair married in 1982. They had a daughter together and lasted four years, despite Mr Sheppard claiming it was a 'rebound relationship' following his split from Lesley. 

It wasn't long after that split that he met his fifth wife Sue at a bingo hall. Despite claiming he wasn't 'swept off his feet by her', he moved in to her two-bedroom home and they married in 1986. They had two sons together but she threw him out after he was offered a job in Bournemouth.

He then went on to marry Usha in 1999, after the pair met while he was on a stop-off trip to Singapore. They lasted four years but split after Mr Sheppard cheated on her during a holiday alone to Thailand. 

1: Margaret, married in 1966. They had three children but were divorced after two years.

2: Jeanette, married in 1973. The marriage lasted one year.

3: Lesley, married in 1976. They had two sons together but Mr Sheppard left in 1981.

4: Kathy, married in 1982. They had one daughter together and  lasted four years.

5: Sue, married in 1986. They had two sons, but she threw him out in 1997.

6: Usha, married in 1999. The marriage to his Singaporean bride ended after four years.

7: Wan, married in 2003. She left him to return home to Bangkok after just eight months.

8: Weng, married in 2004 and are due to celebrate their tenth anniversary next week.

With divorce number six behind him, he met seventh wife Wan in Bangkok in 2003 during a trip to visit an old friend.

However, after returning to the UK, the pair stayed together for just eight months before the bride announced she was returning to her native country in 2003.

It was then that Mr Sheppard met his current wife, Ms Platino, after reaching out online and sparking up a friendship with her.  

And the retired entertainer, who once mentored actor and singer Shane Richie, said he has finally settled down after finding his 'true love' and 'soul mate'.

Mr Sheppard tied the knot with his fifth wife Sue in 1986, when she was already seven months pregnant. Their marriage last a total of 13 years - making it Mr Sheppard's longest partnership out of his eight  marriages

The couple will celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary on November 15.

Mr Sheppard said: 'We were going to go to Spain to celebrate, but Weng only gets two days off.

'Instead I think we'll have a nice steak meal with a bottle of pop.

'We've made it to ten years and I hope there is at least another ten to come.'

Mr Sheppard has spent 44 of the last 47 years married and his longest union lasted 13 years. The shortest lasted just 10 months.

He met Ms Platino after he sent an email to a Christian relationship advisor in the Philippines shortly after splitting with his seventh wife Wan after just eight months in 2003.

He poured his heart out in a lengthy message and kept in touch with his bride-to-be before flying out to Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines, to meet her the following May.

The couple instantly 'clicked' and they married on the Isle of Wight a month later on November 15, 2004.

Mr Sheppard added: 'It's been a decade of pure joy, love and everything that a marriage should be. Weng's changed my life in a way I couldn't have imagined.

'People say we were made for each other. We've never had an argument in ten years and were just compatible in a way I've never experienced.' 

Mr Sheppard, whose new memoir Lord Of The Wedding Rings details his lothario lifestyle, has previously admitted he failed to mention any of his previous marriages to Ms Platino before proposing.

'I was scared that if I told her the truth she would reject me and I knew I'd found the right woman this time,' he sad.

'I had always planned to tell her but couldn't pluck up the courage.' 

In fact, he only told her when she saw him planning his new book and saw his notes about his previous partnerships.

He said: 'She saw me emailing a publisher and saw the words “Wife No 1, Wife No 2 and Wife No 3” and asked me what it all meant. I had to tell her.' 

However, the former student nurse didn't seem to mind and said she wasn't angry. 

She said: 'In my culture, you only get married once, not even twice, so to hear Ron had been married seven times was a big surprise.

'But I'd fallen in love with him. I knew Ron had lived a colourful life but he's such a gentle, caring man. I knew we'd have a lovely life together.'
