For a girl born into a council semi in Accrington, you can understand why Pamela Northampton — Pamela, Marchioness of Northampton to be precise — doesn’t want to let go of Lady’s Secret Court, her Californian home for the past three years.

Its seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms (the master en suite has his-and-hers bathtubs) have marble floors. There is a cinema, games room, and an arts and crafts room.

The house, in Rancho Santa Fe, is surrounded by a pool and a lake and rose gardens. Microsoft’s Bill Gates is a neighbour.

Battle: Lady Northampton (pictured left with Lord Northampton before their bitter divorce in 2012, is taking the lover she left him for, Dan Stoicescu (right), to court claiming she was wrongly evicted from a Californian mansion

Pamela’s 
problem is that the owner of the beautiful estate, pharmaceutical tycoon
 Dr Dan Stoicescu, for whom she left the hapless Marquess of Northampton
 in 2010, is selling it from under her and has served her with an 
eviction notice. He has placed it on the market for just over 
£8 million, and has given her 60 days to leave.

Lady
 Northampton — born Pamela Haworth, daughter of a Lancashire tool-maker —
 is responding with the kind of defiance her previous husband knows only
 too well. Although she and Dr Stoicescu were never married, she is 
claiming ownership of the estate, based on intimate emails he sent her 
while they were together.

The
 6ft 4in Marquess — Spenny to his friends — had to fight hard to 
restrict his own divorce settlement with her to £17 million, and that 
was despite her beginning an affair with one of his friends. She and the
 Marquess had been married for nearly 20 years. ‘She got £850,000 for 
each year of their marriage,’ snaps one of his close chums.

Lavish: Lady Northampton returned to Rancho Sante Fe, San Diego, in March to find an eviction notice

At
 62, Pamela is still something of a temptress. Like the Duchess of 
Cambridge’s mother, Carole Middleton, Pamela — Mela to her friends — 
started out as an air stewardess. Before Dr Stoicescu came along, she 
had been married three times.

She
 wed a Scots businessman when she was 18, and then a wealthy 
Greek-American shipping financier when she was 31. When that marriage 
ended in the late-Eighties, her property interests began. She was left 
with the £2 million marital apartment near the Royal Albert Hall in 
Kensington, which today would be worth in the region of £20 million.

Now
 Pamela, who has no children, has filed a ferocious legal claim on the 
Rancho Santa Fe property, into which she was moved by Dr Stoicescu in 
December 2010 after Spenny Northampton ordered her out of his 
magnificent home, the 84-room Tudor mansion Compton Wynyates, in 
Warwickshire.

She
 swiftly returned with removal vans to take her things, say friends of 
the Marquess, and took the opportunity to have the artworks hanging on 
the walls photographed for valuation through her solicitors.

Pamela’s
 claim to Lady’s Secret Court is based on what she says are promises 
from Dr Stoicescu that the estate would be hers for ever.

In
 documents lodged at the Superior Court of the State of California in 
San Diego, she claims he promised that she ‘would reside there and that 
LSC [Lady’s Secret Court] together with all furniture and furnishings 
would belong to her’.

She
 quotes a series of affectionate emails from him, for example: ‘Thank 
you so much for giving me back my soul and my life, nothing I’ll do in 
the future will ever compensate that!’ And: ‘Do not worry a bit about 
money, as I’ll support you all the way, my beloved.’

Certainly no one foresaw such an acrimonious ending to what had been an affair of unusual passion and secrecy.

The
 slender honey-blonde had become Old Etonian Spenny’s fifth wife at a 
register office wedding in Stratford-upon-Avon before Christmas 1990.

Dubbed
 the ‘mystic Marquess’ because of his fascination with spirituality and 
Freemasonry, he’d been introduced to Pamela at a party by friends.

They
 married within months and he declared: ‘She is the centre of my life. I
 call her “Stregissima — Great White Witch”. She is a healer, very good 
at relaxing me.’ Perhaps they might still have been married had they not
 met Dan Stoicescu at a Freemasonry convention in Cyprus in 2006.

Worth
 £200 million, the balding scientist and entrepreneur was soon invited 
to Compton Wynyates. The couple were both intrigued by Dr Stoicescu, 
whose main home was by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, because of his 
‘transhumanist’ beliefs — the conviction that technology can overcome 
human limitations.

He
 was interested in immortality and anti-ageing therapies, convinced that
 life can be ‘extended through nano-technology and artificial 
intelligence’.

He
 told the couple he was only the second person ever to have his genome 
mapped — charting a body’s DNA and genetic make-up — at a cost of 
£220,000 and generously paid double that for both of the Northamptons to
 go through the process at a clinic in the U.S.

The
 divorced father-of-one, whose fortune came from cancer care products, 
was also generous to Pamela’s father Jim, buying him a £1,300 bottle of 
wine from Harrods and a Rolex watch.

But
 in 2009, the Marquess began to suspect that his wife was having an 
affair with the Romanian. Pamela had been to New York for meetings with 
Dr Stoicescu — he had made her president of one of his pharmaceutical 
companies.

On
 her return to Compton Wynyates, Spenny noticed that she was not wearing
 her wedding ring. Her explanation was that during the flight her 
fingers had swollen and she’d had the band cut off.

Her
 trips abroad became more frequent, and Spenny realised that she now 
possessed a Roland Cartier gold and diamond necklace. In fact this was 
just one of several pieces of jewellery that Pamela, then 58, had been 
bought by her lover.

The
 affair was finally exposed when Lord Northampton was given tapes of 
phone conversations between his wife and her father Jim, now 89. They 
had been secretly recorded by Jim’s then partner Suzanne, who was fond 
of Spenny and upset at Pamela’s deceit.

The
 Marquess was heartbroken and threw his wife out. Their divorce dispute 
over a financial pay-off was heading for the High Court when the 
settlement of £17 million was arranged just over a year ago. They have 
never met since.

But
 just as he was being named in court as Lady Northampton’s lover, Dr 
Stoicescu, 62, was embarking on another affair behind her back. By late 
2012 he was married to Maria Torres, 50, from Santa Domingo in the 
Dominican Republic.

Unsurprisingly,
 some of Spenny’s friends can hardly conceal their glee at the break-up 
of Pamela’s relationship with Dr Stoicescu.

‘After
 what she did to Spenny, I can’t pretend I wanted her to live happily 
ever after,’ one admits. ‘But she is tough, and Dan Stoicescu is in for a
 fight.’

T 
 hat certainly seems to be the case. In her affidavit, Pamela is not 
only claiming that the ownership of the Rancho Santa Fe house and its 
contents should be transferred to her, but is also claiming $10 million 
(£6 million) ‘special damages’, representing the value of other property
 and the financial support that was allegedly promised but not paid.

She
 is also seeking general damages of $25,000 (£14,600) for her ‘severe 
emotional distress . . . anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and 
humiliation’.

She
 maintains Stoicescu ‘verbally promised’ her that he would transfer the 
property into her name once her divorce was final. In the court papers, 
she produces an email from Stoicescu dated June 22, 2012, which says: 
‘. . . right now, the only thing I can tell you is that LSC is yours and
 will remain yours for ever, and I’ll do all the paperwork needed to 
provide you with security.’

Other
 emails are documented to show what she claims was the depth of their 
relationship. ‘Your honesty and beautiful mind and warm, good vibes can 
only mean shared fulfilment of these crazy objectives,’ she quotes him 
as saying.

The
 papers also disclose how Stoicescu had promised to keep her in the 
style to which she had become accustomed, including £30,000 a month to 
cover her ‘personal girlish stuff’.

Pamela
 has added one additional and highly personal reason why she does not 
want to leave the estate. She scattered her mother’s ashes there. This 
means, she claims, she has a ‘personal, emotional and permanent’ 
investment in it.

In
 a counter-claim, Dr Stoicescu insists Lady Northampton has no 
‘enforceable contract supporting her claim’ beyond a memorandum which 
outlines a number of options for the future of the property.Pamela 
remains at the disputed property, while Dr Stoicescu is dividing his 
time between his home near Geneva, a skiing lodge in Verbier and a house
 in Bucharest.

Lord
 Northampton, a mere spectator to this domestic wrangling, is reluctant 
to say much but told us: ‘It doesn’t surprise me that this is going on.’

His
 friends are less restrained. ‘Pamela is one of the most diabolical 
bitches I have had the misfortune of knowing,’ says one. ‘There’s no 
sympathy for either her or Stoicescu.’

Since
 the divorce, the ever-optimistic Spenny has married for a sixth time, 
to psychotherapist Tracy Goodman. ‘I am very happy now with a very 
special person,’ he says.

As for his colourful ex-wife — well, she is very much available, should the right man come along . . .
