George Osborne made sure he had an all-American experience at an American football game by tucking into a hot dog while sitting in the stands.

The Chancellor enjoyed the snack as he sat in the Royal Box at Wembley on Sunday night, where he saw the Dallas Cowboys take on the Jacksonville Jaguars. 

But he was careful to eat the hot dog in bite-sized pieces - avoiding a repeat of Ed Miliband's well-publicised bacon sandwich blunder from earlier this year.

Mr Osborne was joined by his son Luke, an avid fan of the sport, and the pair kept a close eye on the game as they watched the Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17. 

Mr Osborne, who studied in North Carolina, has said that he is keen to push forward with the idea of bringing the National Football League to England on a permanent basis.

Last month he opened talks with American Football authorities and has held discussions over using Wembley as a permanent base.

The photographs taken of Mr Osborne echo those taken of Labour leader Ed Miliband as he sat down to a bacon sandwich while on a visit to London in April.

A number of photographs showed Mr Miliband pulling a series of contorted faces as he ate the sandwich during a visit to new Covent Garden Market. 

The incident was well-publicised, with many drawing attention to Mr Miliband's awkward nature.

Mr Osborne said that he admires the numbered plays, the chess-like tactics and the physical toll that can destroy the most promising player.

But he admitted that his support for establishing the sport in England stems from his son's love of the game.

Speaking to the Evening Standard last month, Mr Osborne said: 'One of London's massive strengths is its sporting prowess, its great football  teams.

'This is primarily a decision for the owners of the clubs and the NFL organisation but I've said to the NFL that anything the Government can do to make this happen we will do, because I think it would be a huge boost to London.'

He added that he believes Britain can bring its own unique style to the American national sport.

He said: 'We could have not just the Star Spangled Banner at the beginning of NFL games but also God Save The Queen.'
