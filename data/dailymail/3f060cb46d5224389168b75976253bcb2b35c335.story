An Indonesian minister has threatened to release a 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers towards Australia if the Federal Government continues to fight for a stay of execution for the Bali Nine duo.

The warning came from the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs -Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from Australian shores, Fairfax Media reported.

It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to Bali.

Mr Tedjo, who is a former navy chief, said his government had been played a big part in stopping asylum seekers from making their way to Australia during a speech made at a Yogyakarta university broadcast on Metro TV.

'If Canberra keeps doing things that displease Indonesia, Jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to Australia,' he said.

'There are more than 10,000 [asylum seekers] in Indonesia today. If they are let go to Australia, it will be like a human tsunami.'

Mr Tedjo - who is an outspoken politician in Indonesia - added it was 'no big deal' if trade relations with Australia fell apart following the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman.

He said Australia was the nation that benefited most from the agreement, not Indonesia.

'Australia will in fact receive pressure domestically if it stops its livestock exports to Indonesia since Indonesia is Australia's main market,' Mr Tedjo said. 

The minister also labelled Julie Bishop's earlier request to spare Chan and Sukuraman in exchange for three Indonesia drug smugglers held in Australia as 'unethical'.

He said Australia needed to respect the laws of Indonesia.

This comes as the Bali Nine pair spent their seventh night at Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island' - as they await the outcomes of appeals made by other prisoners who are scheduled to be executed alongside them. 

Chan and Sukuraman were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms from Indonesia to Australia.

They have spent the last 10 years inside Kerobokan prison in Bali.

Chan converted to Christianity and became a pastor while behind bars.

At the same time, Sukuraman trained as an artist, even teaching other inmates how to paint.
