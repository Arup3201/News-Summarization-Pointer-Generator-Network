Bradford City are refusing to be drawn into a war of words with Sunderland after Gus Poyet labelled the Valley Parade pitch as 'one of the worst in the country' and even invited them to switch their FA Cup tie to the Stadium of Light.

The Black Cats face the Bantams in the fifth round a week on Sunday and Poyet has expressed serious concern over the state of the playing surface.

Bradford – whose own manager Phil Parkinson has also slammed the boggy pitch – would not comment on Poyet's remarks, but the Premier League club could ask their League One opponents for assurances over the pitch before their meeting on February 15.

Referee Kevin Johnson was close to postponing Bradford's 1-1 draw with Colchester on Saturday amid concerns over the players' safety, and they still have a home fixture with MK Dons before the visit of Sunderland.

And Poyet said: 'I'll invite them to come to the Stadium of Light. Our pitch is great. We can ask them to change the venue, but I don't think they'll accept that.

'Maybe we'll have to play a little more direct. Maybe I'm going to ask the groundsman at our training ground to mash one of the pitches and train on it the week before.

'We are already talking about their pitch, which everyone knows is one of the worst in the country. So that is going to make the game different. It won't be a passing game.

'Bradford can play a bit, I've seen them, and I'm sure they're not happy about the pitch as well. It's also a problem for them.'

Parkinson, meanwhile, criticised the surface at the weekend.

'Three months ago after we played Gillingham I told the directors that the pitch is giving way when they're turning and I asked if they could do everything they could to make the pitch better,' he said.

'I think at the time they thought I was making excuses because the home form was poor but I don't make excuses. Nothing was done, no help was given to the groundsman and now he's the one with all the stress of us playing on probably the worst pitch I've ever seen.'
