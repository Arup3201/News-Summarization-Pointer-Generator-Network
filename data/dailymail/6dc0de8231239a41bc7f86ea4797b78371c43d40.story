It's a shot normally seen on park tennis courts on a Saturday morning, not the lush green grass of Wimbledon.

But Klara Koukalova showed that even professional players get it wrong sometimes when she served the ball into the back of her doubles partner's HEAD.

Monica Niculescu was crouching at the net but felt the full force of the 100mph serve. She was consoled by Koukalova and had to sit at the side of the court to recover.

The pair were taking on 16th seeds Garbine Muguruza and Carla Suarez Navarro but lost after three sets, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.
