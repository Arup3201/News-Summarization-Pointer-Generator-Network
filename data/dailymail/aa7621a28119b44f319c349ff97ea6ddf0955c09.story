A disabled man was left with boot prints on his face after he was savagely attacked from behind while out walking his dog.

Andrew Thornton, 25, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was left with shocking facial injuries after he was attacked in Campbell Park, Hebburn, Tyne and Wear.

His father Michael Thornton released a photo of his son’s injuries on Facebook in the hope it would prompt anyone with information about the attack to come forward.

The photo of Mr Thornton, who is a keen runner, has since been retweeted by many people on Twitter including comedian Chris Ramsey.

Mr Thornton, 49, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear said: ‘Andrew had been out for about an hour with his dog when he was set upon from behind.

‘He can't remember much of the attack 
apart from having seen a group of three lads aged about 19 to 22 hanging
around on Monkton Lane shortly beforehand, and then being aware of 
someone approaching him quickly from the behind and to the side.

‘He was knocked down and concussed. There are boot prints on his face.

‘A young lad found him afterwards, called paramedics and stayed with him till they arrived, as did a woman who was passing by.

‘It just goes to show there are still some good people left in the world.

‘It seems like it was a completely random attack. Andrew suffers from cerebral palsy and is the most placid lad you could meet.

‘It looks like he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the attack, which happened at 4.30pm last Friday, to come forward.

A 19-year-old man has been arrested and is in custody, assisting police with their enquiries.

The victim’s cerebral palsy means he has difficulty with speech, but he was able to tell the paramedics his name and postcode.

His terrier mongrel Darcy stayed with him throughout the attack.

He was taken to hospital for treatment but is now back at home recovering.
