A double murder of a 16-year-old and his friend, who were shot dead on their porch in 2007, may have been solved after a rapper was accused of boasting about the crime in a song.

Virginia police said the killings of Christopher Horton and Brian Dean, 20, in a suspected gang-related crime in Newport News, had gone cold.

However, 22-year-old Antwain 'Twain Gotti' Steward was arrested earlier this month and charged with the double shooting, after a detective followed a tip about the rapper's lyrics.

Charged: Rapper Antwain Steward has been arrested for a double murder in 2007

Two witnesses allegedly contacted police to say that the rapper appeared to be boasting of the killing in May 2007, in his song 'Ride Out', according to Gawker.

The song, which included the line 
'Everybody saw when I f***in choked him, but nobody saw when I f***in 
smoked him' had been posted on Steward's MySpace page in 2009 and then 
appeared on YouTube in 2011.

Listen, walk to your boy and I 
approached him, 12 midnight on his traphouse porch and everybody saw 
when I f***in choked him. But nobody saw when I f***in smoked him, roped
him, sharpened up the shank then I poked him, 357 Smith & Wesson 
[unintelligible] scoped him, roped him, had me crackin up so I joked 
him, it is betweezy six feet ova, told ya f*** with my money I'll roast 
ya.

Steward is being held without bond on 
two counts of felony murder, one count of unlawfully discharging a 
firearm and two counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a 
felony.

'Who puts something in a song that they did like that,' Christopher's sister, Tai Horton, told NBC News. 'It's crazy. That's what I think. Why would he do that?'

According to Gawker, police believe Steward shot Christopher after an argument earlier in the day.

He had been a suspect in the original case, along with two others who were believed to be part of the Wickzoo gang, Gawker reported.

Christopher was believed to have been in a rival gang known as the Dump Squad.

Because Steward was a teenager at the time of the shooting, he is due to be tried as a juvenile, according to News 10.

He denies being involved and took to Twitter to state: 'S/o [shoutout] to everybody that's 
supporting thru this BS. Innocent is a fact!!!! 
Y'all know with love comes hate!!'

Miss Norton told 10 News she believes the rapper is guilty of her brother's murder, adding: 'The pain never goes away.'

She added: 'He's basically a murderer in my eyes. [A conviction] will help. It won't bring my brother 
back, but it will give some closure that we need right now.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
