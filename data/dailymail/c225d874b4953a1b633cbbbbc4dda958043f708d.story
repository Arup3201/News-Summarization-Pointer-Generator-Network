Floyd Mayweather Jnr hit the weights in his gym on Wednesday as Super Bowl-winner Richard Sherman paid him a visit.

Mayweather was pictured shadow boxing in front of the mirror with a set of dumbbells as he continued preparations for his $300million (£200m) mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao.

And he posed for a picture with Seattle Seahawks corner back Sherman who enjoyed some downtime after becoming a father last month.

Sherman lost this year’s Super Bowl when the Seahawks were defeated 28-24 by the Tom Brady-inspired New England Patriots.

Mayweather has been training at his Las Vegas gym this week but will travel to Los Angeles next week to come face-to-face with Pacquiao.

The two men will meet at a press conference on Wednesday, the last time before fight week.

Mayweather’s game plan will be devised by his uncle and dad for the fight at the MGM Grand on May 2.
