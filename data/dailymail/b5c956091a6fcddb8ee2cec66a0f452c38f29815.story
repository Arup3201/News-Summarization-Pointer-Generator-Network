Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has returned home to Venezuela following two months of treatment in Cuba.

In three ecstatic messages posted on Twitter, Mr Chavez, 58, thanked Cuban President and ex-leader Raul and Fidel Castro.

Chavez had not been seen or heard from since he went to Havana, Cuba on December 10 for treatment, in contrast to previous medical visits.

But today his account said: 'We have arrived back in the land of Venezuela. Thank you Lord!! Thanks to my beloved people! We will continue our treatment here.'

He also thanked Venezuelans for their support and said he would continue treatment in his home country.

Pictures released by the Venezuelan government show Hugo Chavez with his daughters Rosa and Maria. The president had not been seen since he left the country to have cancer surgery in Havana, Cuba, in December

There was no information about when or why he returned, and no details about whether he would actively take up the duties of office.

But he added: 'Onwards to victory!! We will live and we will overcome!!!'

In photographs released last week, the
president is seen smiling and propped up on a pillow in bed, surrounded
by his two daughters Rosa and Maria.

In another image, Chavez is seen reading an issue of the Cuban Communist Part newspaper Granma.

The pictures were shown on state television by Chavez's son-in-law, Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza alongside new details about Chavez's condition.

Government opponent have been demanding to know why Chavez hasn't spoken to the nation to explain his illness.

Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the president had overcome a respiratory infection and is breathing through a tracheal tube that makes it difficult for him to speak.

He said: 'After two months of a complicated post-operative process, the patient remains conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.'

Chavez was also pictured looking at the Cuba Communist Party newspaper Granma, in a shot said to have been taken yesterday

Villegas also said that doctors are 
'applying vigorous treatment for his fundamental illness', in an 
apparent reference to cancer.

Villegas
said the Venezuelan government thanks Cuban leaders Raul and Fidel 
Castro 'for the love and the care shown to our president.'

He
said: 'We trust... that Comandante Chavez will overcome these delicate 
circumstances sooner rather than later to accompany his nation in the 
path to new victories,' finishing the statement by saying: 'Viva 
Chavez!'

Before leaving for 
Cuba, Chavez acknowledged there were risks and said that Vice President 
Nicolas Maduro should run in a new election if his cancer fight 
prevented him from staying on as president.

Maduro
has travelled repeatedly to Havana in recent weeks, and has shown 
documents signed by Chavez on television while insisting the president 
remains in charge.

On 
Wednesday, Maduro said that Chavez is undergoing 'extremely complex and 
tough' treatments, but did not specify what they were.

Medical experts told the Associated Press that the government's recent accounts of 'systemic medical treatment' could mean various types of chemotherapy or drug treatments, depending on the type of cancer.

The 58-year-old president has been undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba on-and-off since June 2011.

He has had tumors removed from his pelvic region, and has also undergone prior rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Throughout the treatments, Chavez has not revealed the type of cancer or the location where tumors have been removed.Â 

Since December, the government has provided regular updates, though there have been fewer updates in recent weeks, and often with only vague descriptions of Chavez's condition.
