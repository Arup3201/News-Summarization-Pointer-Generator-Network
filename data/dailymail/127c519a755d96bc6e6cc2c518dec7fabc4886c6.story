Two yobs who stole a memorial plaque honouring two children killed by an IRA bomb blast have escaped prosecution after apologising to one of the victims’ parents.

The thugs agreed to a face-to-face meeting with Colin and Wendy Parry after they were arrested over the disappearance of the bronze plaque last month.

The plaque was erected in Warrington, Cheshire, in memory of the Parrys' 12-year old son Tim and three-year-old Johnathan Ball who were killed in the town in 1993.

The two men, aged 57 and 29, were both facing court and possible jail terms, but the case was dropped after they agreed to attend a specially-convened panel at Warrington town hall to apologise and say they would carry out unpaid work in the community.

It emerged the 29-year-old from Newton Le Willows pulled the plaque off its wall fixings after a boozing binge with friends in the town centre.

The 57-year-old, from Warrington, then found the plaque lying on the floor and took it home. The plaque was recovered following a raid at the older man's home.

Cheshire Police said the 57-year-old man had agreed to carry out four days of voluntary work in the community.

The 29-year-old offered to raise money for the Tim Parry Jonathan Ball Foundation For Peace through a sponsored event.

The move is part of the Government’s new restorative justice campaign and means the pair will not face court.

Valued opportunity: Wendy and Colin Parry said they appreciated the apology from the thieves

Grieving: Mr and Mrs Parry lay a miniature Christmas tree on their son's grave

In a statement, Mr and Mrs Parry said: 'We valued the opportunity to meet the two people who removed the plaque.

'It
enabled us to express in very frank terms just how disappointed and 
saddened we were by their thoughtless acts, especially as they both live
locally.

'Both displayed 
remorse and regret for their actions and accepted with good grace the 
community-based punishment suggested by ourselves and supported by the 
councillors present.

'We 
were able to inform them of the importance of the work of our foundation
and to help them appreciate that we need support and not mindless acts 
of vandalism if we are to continue to build the good reputation of the 
town and its residents.

'Today
we witnessed Restorative Justice in action and we feel it was the most 
appropriate course of action available to us taking account of all those
involved and affected.'

The yobs had targeted the River of Life memorial between April and May.

Tragedy: A floral shrine left in memory of Johnathan Ball at the time of his death in 1993

Heartache: Mourners gather to pay their respects to Johnathan and Tim, who died when two small bombs exploded in litter bins outside a Boots store and a McDonald's restaurant in Bridge Street in Warrington

Both boys died when two small bombs exploded in litter bins outside a Boots store and a McDonald’s restaurant in Bridge Street in Warrington.

The blast sparked a major campaign for peace with Colin and Tim’s mother Wendy setting up a Peace Centre in the town and helping with the Peace Process in Northern Ireland.

The plaque, which was erected alongside a water feature, was unveiled by the Duchess of Kent on November 14, 1996.

The offenders were arrested in June after CCTV images helped identify them.

Ch Supt Richard Strachan from Cheshire Police said: 'This brings offenders face-to-face with the victims of their crime and allows them to talk about what they have done and why they did it.

'They then have the opportunity to listen to the full impact of their crime on their victim or victims and apologise for their actions.

'It puts the needs of the victim first as it allows them to be directly involved in the punishment of the offenders.

'This is not an easy option as many offenders find it difficult to take responsibility and face up to the impact of their crimes.'

Two other men were also arrested over the theft of the plaque but were later freed without charge.

A bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, valued at up to £500,000, has been stolen from the grounds of a Hertfordshire museum.

The 22in-high work, called Sundial, 1965, was taken from The Henry Moore Foundation in Much Hadham in a night-time raid.

Seven years ago, a bronze statue worth
£3m was stolen from the same museum, the sculptor’s former home, and 
was never recovered.

Police later said they believed it had been melted down for its scrap value.

CCTV pictures of the 2005 theft showed
three men loading the statue of “a reclining figure” on to the back of a
Mercedes lorry using a crane.

Police are appealing for anyone with information about the latest incident to come forward.

Detective Inspector Paul Watts said 
“This Sundial sculpture is a valuable piece and we are very keen to 
speak to anyone who may have seen it since 16:30 on 10 July.”

The son of a coal miner, Castleford-born Henry Moore (1898-1986) is regarded as the UK’s most famous sculptor.
