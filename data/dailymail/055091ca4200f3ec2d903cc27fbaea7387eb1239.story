David Cameron enjoyed a tale of rags to riches when he took his family to watch a pantomime as a festive treat.

The Prime Minister settled down to watch an 'especially sumptuous, breathtaking production' of Cinderella in Chipping Norton.

Getting away from the rough and tumble of political life, Mr Cameron spent the afternoon watching the traditional tale of a young kitchen maid overcoming the strictures of her ugly sisters.

They're behind you: David Cameron watched Cinderella at the theatre in Chipping Nortonbefore going backstage to meet cast members including (left to right) Matt Pinches (Buttons), Richard Croughan (Tutti), Lizzie Franks (Cinderella), Isabelle Paige (Fairy Gopdmother) and Lauren Silver (Dandini)

The production boasts: 'Come with us as we transport you to a land of magic and fairytales in this timeless classic tale.

'Ugly sisters, handsome princes and glass slippers all feature in this story of love, laughter and wishes made true.'

The show marks the 40th anniversary the world-famous Chipping Norton panto.

Mr Cameron joined the audience on Saturday night with wife Samantha and his children.

Show director John Terry (corr) said: 'We were extremely pleased to welcome the Prime Minister and his family. This year's production of Cinderella transports the audience to the canals and carnivals of Venice.

'Hopefully this will provide a welcome little holiday from the trials and tribulations of running the country.'

It was certainly a less strenuous constituency engagement for the Witney MP than last week, when Mr Cameron took part in a race along a swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds.

The PM sported a support bandage on his right knee as he took part in the fund-raising competition close to his constituency home in Oxfordshire.

Mr Cameron was forced to climb through a low tunnel as part of the annual race.

The Great Brook Run requires competitors to cover a course just over a mile long, and this year involved considerably more water than usual thanks to recent heavy rain.

After the race, the PM received a medal before posing with wife Samantha
