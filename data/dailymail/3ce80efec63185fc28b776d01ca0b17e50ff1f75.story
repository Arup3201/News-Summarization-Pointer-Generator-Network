AFC Wimbledon claimed their first ever victory over MK Dons with Ade Akinfenwa scoring the winner as they twice came from behind to win 3-2 at stadium:mk.

Having come up short in two previous cup ties, some key substitutions turned the match in their favour as the Dons reached the quarter-finals of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.

MK Dons were gifted the lead in just the second minute when Adam Barrett's poor backpass was seized upon by Daniel Powell, who rounded James Shea before rolling into an empty net.

But Wimbledon bounced back from this early setback when Jack Smith fizzed the ball across from the left for Ade Azeez to bundle in from close range.

However, they shot themselves in the foot again as a another loose pass, this time by Sammy Moore, was eventually punished by Benik Afobe after an untidy scramble.

Two substitutes then won the tie for the Dons when Sean Rigg's shot beat David Martin at his near post before he turned provider by setting up Akinfenwa with nine minutes left.
