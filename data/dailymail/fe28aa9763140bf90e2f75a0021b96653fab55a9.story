Arsene Wenger and his Arsenal team appeared in good spirits as they were put through their paces on Wednesday.

Wenger, who captured the highly-rated Chilean Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona for £30million last week, took to Arsenal's training base at London Colney.

Fresh from his time in Brazil, where he appeared as a pundit for French television at the World Cup, the Gunners manager was seen smiling and shaking hands with midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who was in an equally good mood.

Tomas Rosicky, Abou Diaby, Mathieu Flamini, Kieran Gibbs and Carl Jenkinson were the other notable attendees at Arsenal's training ground, with most of the remaining first teamers granted an extended break following their exploits at the World Cup.

Arsenal will be bidding to win their first Premier League title in more than a decade when the new campaign kicks off next month.

And the Gunners will be boosted in their quest by the arrival of Sanchez with France right-back Mathieu Debuchy and Germany's highly-rated midfielder Sami Khedira also courted by the north Londoners.

Former Liverpool and England striker Michael Owen however, believes Wenger's side will struggle to finish in the top four.

'The signing of Sanchez has made everyone sit up and take note,' said Owen, who now works as a pundit for BT Sport.

'I really do rate him, he's a top player and it's a big step in the right direction. But, in no particular order, my top four for next season would be Chelsea, Man City, Man United and Liverpool.

'Arsenal haven't had any real stand out players in the last few years, like Thierry Henry. They have just lagged a step behind.'
