Businesswoman Karren Brady has criticised UKIP leader Nigel Farage over his claims some mothers are 'worth less' to employers than male colleagues.

The star of TV's The Apprentice - who last week took her seat as a Tory peer - said Mr Farage's attitude made her 'shudder'.

Baroness Brady, who is David Cameron's small business ambassador, spoke out at a meeting with entrepreneurs and bosses while campaigning in Rochester and Strood ahead of next week's by-election.

The Apprentice judge criticised the comments made by Nigel Farage saying it made her 'shudder' 

Tory defector Mark Reckless is widely expected to take the seat from his former party - making it the second to fall to the Eurosceptics after fellow defector Douglas Carswell convincingly won the seat of Clacton last month. 

In comments he has subsequently stood by, the UKIP leader has said a woman who takes two or three years off to have a child 'is worth far less to her employer when she comes back' because of losing her client base.

'I do not believe there is any discrimination against women at all,' he said.

'I think young, able women that are prepared to sacrifice the family life and stick with their career will do as well, if not better, than men.'

Karren Brady was appointed managing director of Birmingham Football Club at the 23.

During her 16 years in charge the club went from almost bankrupt to being worth £82 million.

In August 2006 she joined the cast of BBC's The Apprentice as one of Lord Sugar's advisors.

She is now vice-chairman and CEO of West Ham United and has secured a major stadium deal, moving the club to the Olympic Stadium from 2016.

In addition, she has slashed the club's debt from £100million to £20million.

Baroness Brady, who became the managing director of Birmingham City FC at the age of 23, said she admired women who give up work to raise children. 

Today she said: 'When I read comments from UKIP MEPs saying that women "don't have the ambition to go right to the top" and when Nigel Farage says women are "worth less" in business, I shudder.

'These are the attitudes that make women less likely to put themselves forward - just as we need more of the skills and insight they can bring.' 

Earlier this month, Baroness Brady took a seat  in the House of Lords after being appointed a Conservative member of the house.

During the short ceremony of introduction she was flanked by Apprentice co-star Lord Sugar and Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree.

She was introduced as ‘Baroness Brady, of Knightsbridge in our city of Westminster’, but will be known simply as Baroness Brady.

She was one of 22 new party political peers announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August.
