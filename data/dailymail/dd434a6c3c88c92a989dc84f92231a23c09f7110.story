CLICK HERE for the match report from Luis Suarez's international return

Luis Suarez took to Twitter after his first international appearance since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup to tell of his joy to be back in the light blue colours of Uruguay. 

The Barcelona forward created the opening goal with a fine right-footed volley that forced Saudi Arabia's Hassan Muath Fallatah to knock the ball into his own net and Suarez managed 70 minutes in the 1-1 draw.

Afterwards, the 27-year-old said: 'Happy to wear again the shirt that gave me so much joy. The love for the shirt never goes away. Uruguay!'

It didn't all go according to the plan for Suarez, though. 

The former Liverpool striker squandered a one-on-one chance to double Uruguay's lead minutes before being substituted, and asked the referee for permission to visit the toilet while play continued on the pitch.

Nevertheless, it gave Suarez a good opportunity to get his match fitness up ahead of his potential competitive debut for Barcelona in the El Clasico against Real Madrid in a fortnight's time.

It was Suarez's first international match since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup
