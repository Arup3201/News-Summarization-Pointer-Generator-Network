A teenager who took police on a 70-mile chase in a stolen van the wrong way on a motorway has been jailed.

Ryan Nee, 19, stole a white Transit from Billericay, Essex, before heading north on the southbound side of the M11.

Ryan Nee admitted burglary, theft of a vehicle, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a valid driving licence at a previous hearing and was sentenced to 15 months in prison

Police were scattered to try to stop the unemployed teen but he led them on a 70-mile chase all the way to Cambridge.

A police helicopter flew overhead in the early morning chase on May 21 before he was stopped at Godmanchester, Cambs.

Basildon Crown Court heard how the escapade only came to an end when Nee hit a stinger, smashed into a lorry and flipped the van.

An ambulance was called to the scene but amazingly both drivers escaped serious injury with the teen suffering just “superficial wounds”.

When asked why he was caught wearing gloves and a motorbike helmet Nee told police is was “because he was cold”.

One policeman described the chase as the worst case of dangerous driving he had seen in his 26-year career.

Nee, of Harold Hill, Essex, admitted burglary, theft of a vehicle, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a valid driving licence at a previous hearing.

He was sentenced to 15 months in prison when he appeared via videolink at Basildon Crown Court on Monday.

Recorder Elroy Claxton, sentencing, said: “Nee, you must appreciate this was a most dangerous piece of driving.

“Driving on a motorway at night on the wrong side of the carriageway means you were a danger to other road users and a danger to yourself.

“This dangerous driving lasted a significant amount of time and went on for 70 miles.

“Your driving must have been frightening to other road users and there was a real danger of death to either yourself or other people.”

Nee claimed to have been the lookout for a burglary at the property in Billericay and claimed he had not gone inside.

Mike Warren, mitigating, said his client was “clearly not an experienced criminal” and had only taken part to pay off a £300 drug debt for cannabis.

As well as his prison sentence Nee was disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
