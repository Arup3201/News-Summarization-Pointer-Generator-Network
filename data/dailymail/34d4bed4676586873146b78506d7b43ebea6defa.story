Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend today admitted police suspect drugs were at the home they shared when she drowned.

Nick Gordon made the disclosure in legal papers as he brought - then dropped - an attempt to stop police seizing security camera footage from the property where she was found face down in her bath tub on the morning of January 31.

The home in Roswell, Georgia, was owned by Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston at the time she died three years ago.

Gordon, 25, who had been in a tempestuous relationship with her for several years and claimed to have married her, sought a temporary restraining order to prevent police acting on a search warrant involving a security camera.

He had applied to Fulton County Superior Court to stop the company which owns the camera system -  Nest - from complying with the warrant, issued on February 12th.

Gordon holds a 'dropcam' account with California-based company Nest who operate security surveillance equipment.

Today he dropped the case, just as it emerged in public.

In a statement, his lawyers Joe Habachy and Randall Kessler said: 'To protect his client's interests, Mr Habachy filed the Temporary Restraining Order. 

'However, Mr Gordon has since elected to dismiss the claim in an effort to help Roswell PD speed up their investigation.'

However the court papers gave an unprecedented insight into the investigation by Roswell Police Department, confirming for the first time that they suspect drugs were on the property.

The documents say 'there is an insufficient link between the crime alleged in the search warrant, specifically 'possession of a controlled substance.'

The court papers state: 'A drop cam allows plug and play operation of security cameras and stores the data that it collects on "cloud' servers so that the data may be accessed at any time anywhere from an internet connection after logging in to a secure site'.

Court documents filed on his behalf said: 'The Search Warrant violates the Fourth Amendment in that it is overly broad and seeks private data without limitation.

'(It) fails to narrowly limit the scope of the data sought by date or other characteristics.'

It adds: 'Plaintiff, Nicholas Gordon, is a customer of Nest Labs, (which) owns and operates a 'dropcam' web-based security company.

'On February 12, 2015, Nest notified via email its customer, Nicholas Gordon …that it had received 'legal process' for data and documents related to the account and that it intended to comply.'

Case: Nick Gordon (above) who has been photographed waving a hand gun in the air while driving, claims the police quest to access the camera system's records is a breach of his privacy

Gordon, who has been photographed with a hand gun, claims the police quest to access the camera is a breach of his privacy.

Police are treating Bobbi's injuries and near drowning as a criminal investigation.

But Gordon's claim says: 'Privacy, in the context of stored information includes the right to control how stored information is communicated and prevent its abuse.

'lt is more than just confidentiality of data. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution implicitly governs in its very core that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy which inherently extends to the right to control their own data and access thereto.

Gordon's claim confirm for the first time that police suspect narcotics may have been illegally used on the night of January 30/31.

Police have given little information about what they believed may have happened to Bobbi and the lead up to her emergency.

Police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said:'The matter may or may not result in criminal charges being brought against individuals. 'This remains an active investigation and the Roswell Police has no further statement or information to release at this time.'

Gordon's move to protect his privacy is another twist in what has become an increasingly hostile situation between him, Bobbi's father the singer Bobby Brown and members of Whitney's family.

'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up 

Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho

Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant 

Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in  for the last three weeks 

Gordon has been banned from visiting Bobbi's bedside at an Atlanta hospital unless he gives her family the full and unequivocal rundown on what Happened to her.

He has been mouthing off in Twitter against his girlfriend's father questioning his standing as a parent and how much he actually saw and cared for her.

The singer is said to be ' distraught beyond measure' over his daughters condition and praying for her to come out of her coma. 

Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home.

Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home.

A new report which surfaced on Saturday claimed that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub.

In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People.  

Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago.

One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'.

She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital last month after being found by Gordon.

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married.

Last week, she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy.

Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. 

Earlier this week Gordon used Twitter to claim Brown has hardly seen the 21-year-old in years before her accident and is only interested in the family's money.

The 22-year-old told Bobby Brown to 'grow up' - insisting his daughter will hate him when she wakes up.

The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before she was found face down in a bathtub.

Sign of affection: Nick Gordon tweeted this picture of an apparently new tattoo on his arm on Valentine's Day

Gordon also insisted he has taken care of her '24/7' since her mother died in 2012.

On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown.

The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.'

He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her.

'Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.'

Gordon claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs' and added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.'
