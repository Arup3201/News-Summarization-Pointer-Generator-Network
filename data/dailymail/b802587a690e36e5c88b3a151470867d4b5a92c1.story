A Twitter troll who labelled a teacher a ‘danger to children’ because she supports gay rights has been ordered to pay her £40,000 in damages.

David Shuttleton, 54, used the phrase in one of many hate-filled tweets to education expert and government adviser Jaye Richards-Hill, 49, because of her support for equal marriage.

The antiques dealer from Barrhead, Glasgow, also sent messages to First Minister Alex Salmond and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon about the woman, who is an adviser to Education Secretary Mike Russell.

Miss Richards-Hill, a leading gay rights campaigner in Scotland, sued Mr Shuttleton for defamation of character - and won, with the Court of Session telling him to hand over £40,000 plus costs.

But the judgement only came ‘by default’ because Mr Shuttleton failed to lodge defences - and he vowed to MailOnline that he would take the case back to court and get it heard again.

He added that he never used the phrase 'a danger to children' towards Miss Richards-Hill, but a tweet on his Twitter account clearly shows he did.

The divorced father of two told the Daily Record: ‘It’s an absolute scandal that homosexuals have got such power in our community. It’s an absolutely scandalous abuse of our laws.’

Mr Shuttleton also claimed he was in fact
a victim of trolling by Miss Richards-Hill and had complained to police 
on various occasions about her, but they had found no basis to 
investigate his claims.

Abuse: This is just a snapshot of many of the tweets exchanged between Mr Shuttleton and Miss Richards-Hill

Miss Richards-Hill declined to comment, but a source close to her told the newspaper that Mr Shuttleton ‘deserved to be exposed’ and that his homophobic comments needed to be ‘challenged’.

The ruling follows a week of increased debate about trolling after a number of high-profile attacks.

Last Thursday Tony Wang, general manager of Twitter UK, apologised to women who have been attacked by trolls on the social networking site and vowed to do more to protect people from abuse.

There has been growing concern over abuse
on the site after three female journalists said they had been the 
subject of bomb threats, while two received threats of rape.

The bomb threat tweet was sent to Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Time magazine Europe editor Catherine Mayer, as well as various other women.

Separately, Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully fought for a woman's face to appear on £10 banknotes, were threatened on Twitter with rape.

And last week Professor Mary Beard named and shamed Oliver Rawlings, 20, after he branded the Cambridge classicist a 'filthy old slut' and added a revolting sexual comment.
