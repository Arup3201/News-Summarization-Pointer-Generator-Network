Two leading officials at the 
scandal-hit police union dramatically quit yesterday, just days after it
 faced fresh, disturbing questions over its role in the Plebgate affair.

Steve
 Williams, chairman of the Police Federation, and general secretary Ian 
Rennie resigned days after the Daily Mail revealed it had hired a PR 
firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the 
Government.

In addition, the Mail has run a series of investigations revealing:

Quit: Chairman Steve Williams and General Secretary Ian Rennie will step down, plunging the Police Federation into crisis after a turbulent period

Both
 Mr Williams and Mr Rennie were aware of the decision to award a 
£10,000-a-month deal to a controversial public relations company to 
oppose Coalition plans on police pay and reform.

The
 ‘guerrilla tactics’ deal had been agreed just weeks before the now 
infamous Plebgate incident in September 2012, involving then chief whip 
Andrew Mitchell and a policeman at the gates of Downing Street.

Critics
 of the Federation argue that the union mercilessly exploited Mr 
Mitchell’s bust up at the gates as part of its ongoing campaign against 
ministers who wanted to reform its working practices.

Last
 week Police Minister Damian Green said that the Federation – which 
represents 125,000 rank and file officers – should put its house in 
order or face tough new laws forcing it to reform.

Mr
 Williams and Mr Rennie will leave in late May after the union’s annual 
conference – plunging one of Britain’s most powerful staff bodies into 
crisis.

Last night their decision to leave at such a sensitive time was greeted with surprise by senior politicians.

Home
 Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz will today hear evidence about Sir
 David Normington’s highly critical review of the union which called for
 top-to-bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture.

Last
 night Mr Vaz said: ‘I am amazed and surprised by the proposed 
retirement of two people who have been instrumental in instigating 
reform in the Police Federation.

‘These
 retirements will leave this important organisation with a huge vacuum 
and leaderless at a time when they need strong direction. It will remain
 to be seen if the Federation will continue on the path of change.’

Home
 Secretary Theresa May said: ‘As chairman, Steve Williams understood 
that the Police Federation needs to change, and I am sorry that he will 
be retiring in May.

‘If the
 Federation is to have public legitimacy, the Normington recommendations
 now need to be implemented, in full and in good time.’ Pointedly, Mrs 
May made no comment on Mr Rennie’s resignation.

Insiders
 predicted last night that further heads would roll over the Federation 
scandal. A source said: ‘There are a lot of unresolved issues at the 
Federation, not least the offshore bank accounts, outrageous spending on
 credit cards and general culture of secrecy.’ Details of the ‘guerrilla
 tactics’ plan were confirmed by a former senior Police Federation 
official when she appeared before the Home Affairs Committee last week.

Fiona
 McElroy – who says she was sacked after advocating reform at the 
Federation – said the anti-Government plot was outlined in a contract 
handed to a public relations company run by former DJ Jon Gaunt in 2012.

The deal, agreed by national Federation leaders, lasted only two months
 but Mr Gaunt continued to provide PR advice to three branches of the 
Federation in the Midlands, all central to the ‘Plebgate’ storm.

But 
cracks in the Federation’s unity had started to emerge in January, when 
an independent review of the union by former Home Office mandarin Sir 
David concluded that the organisation had a staggering £95million in 
reserves and assets.

Investigators
 found there were centrally held funds of £29.5million and those held by
 branch boards stood at around £35million, but there was also another 
estimated £30million in separate accounts, details of which were not 
given to the national heads of the organisation.

In
 a statement Mr Williams, who according to Miss McElroy’s testimony had 
previously been ‘bullied and ridiculed’ by senior colleagues, 
acknowledged the union had faced a ‘turbulent period’.

The
 chairman, who has been in the post barely a year, said: ‘When I took up
 office it was quite clear that as an organisation we were not fit for 
purpose and that is why I … commissioned an independent review … It 
delivered a hard-hitting report that clearly showed that we were not 
delivering what our members wanted, were failing in key areas and that 
many of our practices were outdated. I have made no secret of my fears 
that unless we get this right and embrace the change required others 
will do it to us, a view echoed recently by the Policing Minister, 
Damian Green.’  

Mr Rennie, 
who had been in the post for six years and was regarded as a hardliner 
on police pay and conditions, said he was stepping down after it became 
clear he no longer had the support of a number of senior colleagues.

Yesterday it was claimed that the national Police Federation was set to reject demands for ‘top-to-bottom’ reforms.
