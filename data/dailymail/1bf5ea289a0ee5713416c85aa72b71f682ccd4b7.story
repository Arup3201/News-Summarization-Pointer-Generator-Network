Asmir Begovic has a big, long weekend ahead of him. On Friday night he is tasked with keeping Gareth Bale from finding the net.

On Monday, there is Eden Hazard to contend with. Arguably, two of the best five attackers in the world in the space of four days. Good luck with that.

The Stoke goalkeeper pulls on his Bosnia jersey to resume their qualifying campaign for Euro 2016 and will line-up in Cardiff to face the world most expensive player for a sixth time in his career. A point of interest: so far, Bale has yet to score.

Thibaut Courtois has been beaten by Bale, Joe Hart and Petr Cech too. But not Begovic. ‘Hopefully we can keep it that way,’ he says, having been previously unaware. ‘That would be good.’

They have played on opposing teams four times for Tottenham and Stoke, dating back to April 2011 and as recently as May 2013. In February last year, Begovic tweeted that Bale had gone into ‘Beast Mode’ after scoring a brace, including a brilliant late winner, against West Ham at Upton Park.

But six months prior to that Begovic kept a clean sheet as Bosnia beat Wales, and Bale, 2-0 in a friendly in Llanelli. Such quirks happen in football and Bale has progressed his talents to a higher level since moving to Real Madrid but it provides a mini-duel to note when their nations collide.

‘I’ve had the joy of playing against him a few times and had a lot of fun doing it,’ says Begovic. ‘I think he is up there now as one of the best players in the world. Make no mistake about it, it will be a huge test for us as a whole team to try and contain him.

‘Wales as a team have grown. They have factors all over the pitch and good players in each position. But obviously Gareth Bale stands out. He is going to be a tough player to mark.’

Since we spoke, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen have been forced out through injury, bringing the focus on Bale even greater.

Begovic is speaking at a fundraiser for his self-named charity foundation, which grants money to improve sporting facilities in Stoke and his native Bosnia.

It is clearly something he has close to heart, having fled his war-torn homeland with his family aged four. ‘The charity has been set up to build sporting facilities, rebuild current ones,’ he explains. ‘It is mainly to do with encouraging kids to go out, enjoy sport, be active. It affects so many different areas of life that it can do good. It’s in Bosnia and the local Staffordshire area.’

Sport has been Begovic’s spur. Not only is the 27-year-old one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the Premier League, he is also a fan of tennis, basketball, baseball, American football, and hockey, name-dropping Rafael Nadal, LeBron James, and Tom Brady as heroes.

That North American link comes from growing up in Edmonton, Canada, having moved across the Atlantic from Germany. He can speak Bosnian, German, English and French (from his time playing in Belgium) as a result.

His season to date has been mixed. Two clean sheets against Manchester City and Newcastle, but five goals conceded against Queens Park Rangers and Sunderland. Stoke are yet to fire like they did last season.

The same goes for Bosnia, who suffered a shock loss to Cyprus to place extra importance on the Wales match on Friday night. Wales beat Andorra 2-1 thanks to a Bale brace in their first match, while Belgium and Israel complete qualifying Group B.

‘Of course it puts a bit more pressure on the Wales game,’ says Begovic of the 2-1 home defeat to Cyprus. ‘Going forward the group is going to be very competitive, it’s very open, teams will get points off each other.

‘So even though we lost the first game nothing is lost in the big picture. Hopefully if we can get a positive result in Cardiff we can push on from there and get as many points as we need to qualify for the tournament.

‘Whether we go directly or via play-off it doesn’t matter as long as we get there in the end.’

Begovic played all 270 minutes of Bosnia’s World Cup, where they lost narrowly to Argentina and Nigeria before beating Iran 3-1 but failing to make it to the knock-out phase.

‘We got to play against Argentina at the Maracana. It doesn’t get much better than that,’ says Begovic. ‘Just being part of that makes you a better player, a better person. Gives you a sense of achievement.

‘No matter the results we made the most of the whole experience and hopefully we can become a better team going forwards and use it as motivation to be involved in more major tournaments.’

Congratulations to Coventry City Council for alienating not one, but two sets of fans over their vote to sell the Ricoh Arena to Wasps in a £20million deal.

Not only are the rugby team’s supporters understandably angry at the prospect of having to trek an extra 82 miles to attend home games, but Coventry’s faithful are also wary at what it might mean for them.

London Wasps have agreed a deal to move to the Ricoh Arena, alienating both their fans and Coventry City

Only last month the football team returned to the ground, on an initial two-year basis, after an exile in Northampton but that security is cast in doubt. How will the ground-share work? Will the colours change? What about the pitch? Questions supporters would like answers to.

The fractious relationship between the council and Coventry owners Sisu means communication was always likely to be minimal but in this game of financial brinksmanship it is the fans who suffer. It always is.

Speaking of which, Hereford Town have been offered an olive branch by local rivals Kidderminster Harriers as the latest chapter in their sorry ownership continues.

Kidderminster will allow hundreds of Hereford fans to protest against the running of their club during their Conference match against Welling on Wednesday night, which is broadcast live on BT Sport.

Hereford, famous for Ronnie Radford’s rocket, dropped two divisions this summer to the Southern League because of financial irregularities and remain in deep money troubles.

Martin Watson, Hereford United Supporters Trust vice-chairman, said: ‘We are going to be singing a few songs, we've got some banners. Basically we're going to make a noise.’
