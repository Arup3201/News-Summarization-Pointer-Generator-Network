It's the long-lasting love affair that has defied time, squabbles, Hitler's bombs and even a freak lightning strike.

Teenage sweethearts Kenneth, now 90, and Margery Owen, 91, from Hall Green, Birmingham, have survived them all to celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary, marking 70 years together - and they've lived in the same home for 66 of them.

Margery Copage first began dating dashing airman Ken, who she met at a Shirley Institute dance, shortly after her family's home in Fastpits Lane, South Yardley, was hit by a Nazi shell.

She clearly remembers hiding in the garden shelter when the bomb landed: 'They say you don’t hear the bombs hit you, but you do. We all ducked down and the whole ground shook.

'We waited an hour and then went outside. The blast had split the shelter and there was a huge crater that came right up to the wall. It only landed about a metre away. We only had the clothes we were standing in.'

After staying with relatives, Margery, her mother Nellie and father George found a property in Baldwin Lane, Hall Green

The couple were soon engaged, but Margery and Ken's was a love 
affair that had to defy distance as well as detonations. As a member of the 
RAF he was posted to Newquay - a 13.5-hour rail journey to his fiance.

Ken said: 'We wrote every day
to each other. I knew that if I posted a letter by 8pm at the central 
post office it would get to her the next morning.'

The pair were engaged for a year before getting married on 27 February 1943, at St John’s Church, Sparkhill, but just weeks before their wedding a Nazi bomb strike demolished Margery's family home.

'We all dived down,' remembered Margery. 'They released two bombs at the same time, the one from the other side killed an elderly woman across the road and the other hit our fireplace.

'We all had to rush off not knowing when it was going to go off. Five days later it blew and demolished two houses next door and knocked down half of two others.'

Having a war wedding wasn't easy. Ration cards had to be pooled together to purchase the buffet, and rather than fancy canapes and salmon, guests tucked into offal.

Margery's colleagues at Rover, where she worked as a shorthand typist, made the cake. Due to a shortage of ingredients it had to be a chocolate sponge.

There was one further disaster waiting for the couple - this time a natural one. Their first home - rented accommodation in Reddings Lane - was struck by fireball lightning, destroying the chimney.

'My father was on the toilet outside and he came running down the yard when it hit and destroyed the roof and chimney,' laughed Margery.

When the Baldwin Lane property was rebuilt, they moved back. And Ken and Margery have stayed their ever since - an incredible 66 years.

The couple have two daughters and one son, nine grandchildren and are thrilled to have welcomed the next generation into the family with the arrival of three great-grandchildren. And Ken has spent his entire working life with Sparkhill firm Lucas Batteries.

Margery said: 'It’s a very happy marriage and we have some wonderful memories. I put it all down to our lovely family.'

They celebrated with a card from the queen and a party at their daughter's Dorridge home. The family brought in a Rolls Royce for the journey.

When asked for the secret to a long and happy marriage, Ken said: 'I’ve been racking my brains over that one for years. It comes naturally. I found the right one, that’s for sure. I honestly think the world of her and, you know, I think she thinks a lot of me.'
