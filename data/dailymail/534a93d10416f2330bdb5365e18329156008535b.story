As chief political correspondent for Sky News, Jon Craig is surely aware of the hazards posed by recording his reports within earshot of Big Ben.

The clocktower rings in every quarter hour and, on each and every hour of the day, the sound of its great bell resonates across Westminster and beyond as it enumerates the time.

But it seems to have nonetheless come as a surprise to the Mr Craig when Big Ben's chimes came as he was in full flow of delineating the day's events in politics.

Ever the professional: John Craig delivers his report on David Cameron's trip to Brussels

But what's this? Something dismays the veteran reporter who shuts his eyes in rage

Why you! Craig turns his head to Big Ben, whose chimes have ruined his recorded segment

'Oh, f***ing hell,' he blurted, angrily turning his head to Big Ben in footage that was broadcast to the nation on Sky News last night.

Mr Craig's obscene outburst prefaced a brief awkward silence followed by a quick cut back to the studio, where newsreader Lukwesa Burak was staring down the camera witheringly.

'We do apologise for that,' she said. 'That was a much earlier recording and our apologies here from Sky News. Moving on...'

Mr Craig had been trying to report on Prime Minister David Cameron's trip to Brussels, Belgium, to meet European Union leaders and discuss the rise of eurosceptic parties in last week's elections to the European Parliament.

Oh dear: The viewers are treated to Mr Craig's naughty boy face as he realises the obscenities he has uttered

Producers, it later emerged, had mistakenly aired an out-take. A full report, with no obscenities, was broadcast later.

Ms Burak later admitted on Twitter to being 'slightly thrown' by the unexpected expletive.

She tweeted: 'We do apologise for that. The perils of distracting individuals being a nuisance whilst recording outdoors. We're all human!'

But it is in fact not the first time that Mr Craig inadvertently turned the airwaves blue when discussing Tory politicians. In 2011 he accidentally called Jeremy Hunt a very disparaging name after getting his C's mixed up with his H's.

Having reminded Londoners of the passing of time for the past more than 150 years, the resounding peals of Big Ben are a feature of the UK capital's soundscape that few could fail to anticipate.

Since 2012 the 315ft tower itself has officially been known as the Elizabeth Tower, in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

It was raised as a part of Charles Barry's design for a new Palace of Westminster, after the old one was destroyed by fire on the night of October 16, 1834.

It takes its nickname, Big Ben, from the colloquial name for its 13Â½-ton Great Bell, which hangs at its pinnacle and whose toll is one of the quintessential sounds of London.
