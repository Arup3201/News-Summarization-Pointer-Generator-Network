Apple is believed to be about to start manufacturing the iPhone 5S, the latest version of its hugely successful handset. 

Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that has made previous versions, is believed to have been hiring 10,000 workers a week since March for the production lines that will produce it.

The handset is expected to go on sale in the autumn, and Apple is also believed to be developing a cheaper version.

Customers queue up to purchase the iPhone 5 smartphone at the Apple flagship store on George Street in Sydney, Australia. The firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer.

Apple's next two iPhones had already been designed before Steve Jobs died in October 2011, it has been claimed.

At a meeting with the San Francisco 
district attorney, George Gascón, who is keen to cut phone thefts in the
region, Apple's liaison officer Michael Foulkes is reported by the San 
Francisco Examiner to have said the designs for the next two phones 
'preceded Tim Cook [being chief executive]'.

'We have been very busy recently as we will start mass-producing the new
iPhone soon,' a Zhengzhou-based Foxconn executive told the Wall Street Journal.

The company has more than 1.4 million workers in China, according to the report.

It typically 
adjusts staffing according to the electronics production cycle, for 
which demand usually picks up in the second quarter after a 
traditionally slow start to the year.

The 
new model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but 
include a faster processor and updated camera, according to online 
reports.

It will also run iOS 7, a major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software being overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive.

Earlier this month it was reported Apple had hit major delays with its flagship iOS software due to a radical new look and feel.

Experts say engineers have had to be pulled from its Mac software group so the new version can be finished in time for a rumoured summer launch.

Sir Jonathan was given responsibility for the software earlier this year after the company fired Scott Forstall in a move believed to be related to the firm's huge problems with its Maps app.

'What I've heard: iOS 7 is running behind, and engineers have been pulled from OS X 10.9 to work on it' said John Gruber of the Apple blog Daring Fireball.

He also claimed engineers working on the project had been given special handsets.

'Word on the street is that iOS engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their iPhone displays, such that it greatly decreases viewing angles, thus making it difficult for observers to see the apparently rather significant system-wide UI overhaul.'

The claims echo those made by Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries earlier this year, who said Apple will begin making a new iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July.

Mr
Misek predicted that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers 
anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he 
expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to March.

'As
word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we
could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new 
product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel 
inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider.

'Therefore
we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which 
is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.'

The
analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a 
reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the 
new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life.

On
rumours of an entry-level iPhone, Mr Misek claimed Apple could release a
low-cost device made of polycarbonate with no 4G Long Term Evolution 
(LTE) capability.

The
speculation seemed to contradict comments made by Phil Schiller, 
Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the 
Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones,
this well never be the future of Apple's products.'
