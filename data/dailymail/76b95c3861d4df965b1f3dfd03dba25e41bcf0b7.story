Diplomatic security for the U.S. mission in Benghazi was 'a struggle' and security teams in Libya were drawn down ahead of last month's fatal attack, the former head of a U.S. security team in Libya told lawmakers on Wednesday.

'Diplomatic security remained weak. In April there was only one U.S. diplomatic security agent stationed there,' Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during Congress' first hearing on the assault that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.

'The situation remained uncertain and reports from some Libyans indicated it was getting worse.

Explanations: Charlene Lamb, the diplomatic security deputy who said that she declined to approve more U.S. security as violence in Benghazi spiked, said the department wanted to train Libyans to protect the consulate

Difficult: Lt. Col. Andrew Wood was in charge of the security at the Libyan consulate for the six months before the attack, and said that it was always 'a struggle' due to cuts in security forces

'The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there.'

Wood said that when he arrived in Libya in February there were three U.S. diplomatic special security teams in the country, but by August they had been withdrawn.

He served as the Site Security Team commander in Libya for six months prior to the attack. Woods said he came forward to the congressional committee after Stevens and the three other Americans were killed in the assault.

'The killing of a U.S. ambassador is a rare and extraordinary thing and requires our attention as a people,' he said.

'As a citizen I made the determination that this outweighs all other interests and will risk whatever circumstances may result from my testimony.'

In a day filled with official testimonials, another revelation came from a top diplomatic security deputy who said that she declined to approve more U.S. security as violence in Benghazi spiked, saying the department wanted to train Libyans to protect the consulate.

Attack: The violence at the U.S. embassy on September 11 caused the deaths of the American ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American personnel

'I made the best decisions I could with the information I had,' said Charlene R. Lamb, a deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security.

Partisan tension quickly spilled out at the hearing, with Republicans accusing the State Department of not being fully cooperative in providing information on security decisions before the attack. Democrats accused the majority Republicans of conducting a one-sided probe that excluded them.

Republican charges that the United States was caught unprepared for the September 11 attack have put the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on the defensive ahead of the November 6 presidential election.

Republicans continued their line of attack that the administration initially issued misleading comments saying the assault was a spontaneous event that sprang from a protest against an anti-Islam video.

Altered accounts: Ambassador Patrick Kennedy testified on behalf of the State Department, saying that initially after the attack, intelligence pointed to the belief that it was due to the anti-Muslim video

Taking it in: Rep. Darrell Issa (right) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (left) confer during the hearing where they were told that now intelligence confirms that it was a planned terrorist attack

Administration officials said those initial comments, including by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, resulted from the best information at that time.

'The information she had at that point from the intelligence community is the same that I had at that point,' testified Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management.

However, Reuters reported last week that within hours of the attack, the Obama administration received about a dozen intelligence reports suggesting militants connected to al Qaeda were involved.

Insufficient: Ms Lamb said that the safe haven area within the compound was not strong enough to keep out the dozens of armed attackers

White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that in hindsight 'there is no question that the security was not enough to prevent that tragedy from happening. There were four Americans killed.'

Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee tried to blame Republicans for cutting more than $300 million in diplomatic security funds worldwide.

'The fact is that, since 2011, the House has cut embassy security by hundreds of millions of dollars below the amounts requested by the president,' said Maryland Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee's senior Democrat.

Eric Nordstrom, who was the top security official in Libya earlier this year, testified he was criticized for seeking more security. 'There was no plan and it was hoped it would get better,' he said.

Nordstrom told the committee that conversations he had with people in Washington led him to believe that it was 'abundantly clear we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident. How thin does the ice have to get before someone falls through?'
