Manchester City’s Champions League hopes are clinging by a thread once again after a depressing and controversial night in Russia.

Manuel Pellegrini’s team were 2-0 up and cruising at half-time in the Arena Khimki only to concede twice in the second half.

City headed for home with much to complain about given the highly dubious nature of the penalty that levelled things up for CSKA with four minutes to go and the fact there appeared to be 300 home fans cheering from the main stand on a night when UEFA had decreed the game must be played behind closed doors.

UEFA were investigating that issue amid suggestions sponsors tickets had been sold on the black market to fans. City have complained to the governing body and UEFA officials were seen taking photos of the supporters – many clutching beer bottles – during the second half.

Nevertheless, it is the nature of City’s second half collapse that will trouble Pellegrini even if Bayern Munich’s subsequent rout of Roma in Italy improved the Premier League club’s chances slightly in Group E.

Pellegrini didn’t want to discuss the referee on Tuesday night but when asked if the rogue CSKA fans could have influenced his penalty decision, the City manager said: 'Well I agree but maybe it’s not my duty to talk about things that don’t correspond with my duty.

'UEFA have their rule, they were aware the game was behind closed doors.

'I don’t know who allows or gives permission to give entrance to those people but it’s not my duty.

'I don’t want to talk about that decision. I don’t want to talk about the referee because I don’t want to be punished again.

Leading through goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner at half-time, Pellegrini suggested his players lost their focus and appeared to suggest they were affected by the extreme cold in Moscow.

'We didn’t play well in the second half,' he said.

'Maybe there was an excess of trust [confidence] or it was so cold that it was very difficult for the players to continue to have motivation for the whole game.'

However City officials subsequently suggested Pellegrini meant his team’s football had been too cold.

Pellegrini added: 'I don’t want to find excuses about what happened.

'The cold was the same in the first half as the second half. Maybe in the second half for different reasons we didn’t do it.

'We tried to close the game but we couldn’t.'

CSKA manager Leonid Slutski was asked why so many of his team’s fans were in the stadium but was not allowed to answer by a club press official.

The spokesman Sergey Aksenov said: 'They are part of the Champions Club, invited by UEFA.

'If they are CSKA fans then that’s good.'
