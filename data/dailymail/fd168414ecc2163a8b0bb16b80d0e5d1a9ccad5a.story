Glen Johnson and Bryan Ruiz will line up for their final Group D match at the World Cup with intimate knowledge of each other’s DNA.

The pair, who are set to play for England and Costa Rica in Brazil, have become the first footballers to undergo a revolutionary genetic examination and reveal the results.

Well rounded: Glen Johnson was found to have a good balance between power and endurance

British company DNAFit Life Sciences have devised a series of tests to measure athletes’ physical capabilities and devise bespoke training regimes.

Johnson was found to have a good balance between power and endurance, as well as genes associated with fast-twitch muscle fibres that aid bursts of speed and jumping.

His aerobic potential was measured as very high but he was found to need a diet low in refined carbs like white bread and potatoes.

Loaner: Bryan Ruiz spent most of 2014 on loan at PSV from Fulham

Ruiz was found to have quick recovery time from exercise, so perhaps he will be the fresher of the pair after two games come June 24.

Johnson said: ‘To have this data to show me the best ways to train and to eat so I can be at the top of my game is a remarkable advance.’

Dr Keith Grimaldi, who developed the test, said the results showed Johnson ‘has the perfect genetic make-up for a defender’.
