Underwear tycoon Michelle Mone is selling her luxury home complete with furniture, high-tech security, ten plasma TVs and four dishwashers for £1.5million.

The self-made businesswoman bought the site, in south Lanarkshire, with husband Michael five years ago.

The couple demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a five-bedroom home, six times the size of the average British house.

But their relationship fell apart and following an acrimonious split Mone, 42, has now put the property on the market.

It is located in Thorntonhall, a pretty village regarded as one of the most desirable places to live in Scotland.

Self-made Mone, whose fortune comes from the Ultimo underwear brand, is selling the home with Savills estate agents for £1.5 million.

It is also being offered with all the furniture - estimated to have cost the couple £600,000 - which will be separately negotiated.

No love lost: Michelle and Michael had a very public break up after which may be on reason why Miss Mone is keen to sell the furniture as well as the house

There is a state-of-the-art kitchen designed by the acclaimed Clive Christian and featuring beautifully made Edwardian style units and four dishwashers.

Mone once said: 'I don't like seeing dishes lying around.

'When the dishwasher is on, there's more dishes in the sink.

'That is why there's four in here.'
