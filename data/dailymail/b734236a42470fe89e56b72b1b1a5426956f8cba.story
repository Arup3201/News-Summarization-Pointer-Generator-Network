Down on the farm: Sir Paul McCartney with his first wife Linda on the estate in the early 1970s

He was so happy there he wrote it a ‘love letter’ that became a massive chart hit.

But Paul McCartney’s estate in the Mull of Kintyre is now at the centre of an embarrassing row after he dismissed two members of staff.

Caretaker Jimmy Paterson has been given three months to leave his tied cottage, and estate manager Bobby Cairns has been fired.

It is understood the pair, with 55 years of service between them, are under strict contractual instructions not to reveal any details.

But their friends and families said last night the sackings came out of the blue, and they believe Sir Paul has fallen out of love with south-west Scotland.

One neighbour said: ‘I think he lost faith in Mull of Kintyre when Linda died [in 1998]. He’s hardly been here.’

The former Beatle, who is 71, bought the remote farm in 1966 and it became a refuge where his late wife Linda and he found solace, and where their children spent the summer holidays.

He bought two neighbouring farms in later years and created a 600-acre wildlife haven.

‘It seems like he’s lost interest,’ said the neighbour. ‘He came far more when Wings were on the go. He was around more in his heyday, when he’d come in his private plane.

‘And that’s when he had the big gates and the guards.

‘I don’t think he’ll be planning to sell the land – he’ll just be trying to make it more of a viable unit. But unfortunately these two chaps are going to lose their jobs.

‘Somebody else said he’s got a new factor, someone who looks after his estate, and they’ve seen that it’s been losing money. So we think that might be why.’ Mr Paterson, 50, who lives at High Peak Farm with fiancée Marion Pope, 51, and their 17 dogs, takes care of day-to-day business.

Yesterday Miss Pope’s mother Margaret Barnes said: ‘I know Marion will be hurting badly, and Jimmy will be as well. I don’t know where they’ll go.

'Marion had a house before she moved to the farm but she gave that up.

The Beatle, 71, famously sang that he wanted to always live there. But since then he has fallen out of love with it

'It is a shocking thing to have happened, especially with Jimmy being there 20 years.

'You’d think they’d be given more than three months.

‘I hope she is alright. The farm was her life.’

Mr Cairns, 52, who lives in nearby Campbeltown, was also staying tight-lipped.

A friend of Sir Paul said the decision had not been made lightly, and added: ‘The land has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair this last 15 years or so, hence making the change in management.

‘They want to bring the land back up to scratch and make it workable again. It’s time for a change.

The McCartneys spent their time in their 'little hideaway' with children Mary, Stella and James

'The Forestry Commission will be involved and Paul’s people are taking advice on what to do.’

Sir Paul once described the farm as a ‘little hideaway’, adding: ‘It is a lovely place. I love it. I love the people up there.

‘I am so relaxed up there, I can sort of breathe when I get up there, pure air.’

Following Linda’s death from breast cancer in 1998, a statue of her cradling a lamb was set up in a memorial garden in Campbeltown.

More recently, the sprawling farm was listed as a £1.5million asset during Sir Paul and Heather Mills’s divorce battle.

Last night a spokesman for Sir Paul declined to comment.
