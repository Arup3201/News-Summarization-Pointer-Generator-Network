Nigel Pearson is still hopeful a deal for Esteban Cambiasso can be done but the Leicester manager admitted complications were arising because of agents, who he said were ‘coming out of the woodwork’.

Signing the Argentina international, 34, is a priority given injuries to central midfielders Danny Drinkwater and Matty James, who will both miss the trip to Chelsea on Saturday.

A two-year contract is on the cards for Cambiasso, but Pearson is experiencing the added difficulties of securing players in the Premier League as opposed to the Championship.

‘We’ve not really made too much progress on that as we stand but I’m hopeful something can be done,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately at times it’s a complicated process, there appear to be representatives coming out of the woodwork.

‘It’s a case of working out who represents who and adding strength to the squad.

‘There are more potential representatives because the profile of any club in top flight has more media exposure, so there are greater chances of details around deals to be leaked.

‘We’re still trying to look in markets where there isn’t a general interest, not chasing players where its common ground for many clubs.

‘It’s proving to be difficult, it has been all summer, but I’m very clear on the fact it’s very important for us to acquire players who will be right for us.

‘I don’t intend in last few days adding for the sake of it. We continue to recruit with standards we always have done.

‘It’s fair to say we could do with one or two more but that’s not to say I’m not pleased with the payers we have already.’
