Rory McIlroy will set out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf's greatest-ever players in a fortnight's time.

The world No 1 will arrive at Augusta National hunting the elusive Green Jacket he needs to complete a historic Grand Slam of majors.

Only five players have achieved the incredible feat, post-war. But victory at the Masters will elevate the Northern Irishman into the company of legends Gene Sarazen, Gary Player, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.

At times, McIlroy has made it look easy. For the past 73 weeks he has been the leading golfer on the planet, landing The Open and the US PGA Championship along the way.

Although the 25-year-old still has a long way to go before surpassing Woods' record of 683 total weeks as world No 1, he is undoubtedly the American's successor as golf's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens. 

And  his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand.

'It was when I started to notice results that I fell in love with it,' said McIlroy, who has offered a fascinating and unique insight into his preparation off the course in this new Nike training video, seen exclusively by Sportsmail.

Indeed, McIlroy has bulked up considerably over the past five years with his transformation evident in both stature and presence on the course.

Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, a British exercise physiologist who has previously masterminded the fitness programmes for Manchester City and the NBA's New York Knicks.

When McIlroy first started with McGregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg. Now, with 14 wins and four majors to his name, he has the muscle strength to last on one leg throughout an entire golf swing.

'I wasn't really big into the gym,' he admits. 'So my physical training was pretty much non-existent from when I turned pro at 18 until I turned 21.

'I had three years when I was playing professionally on the Tour, doing OK but not, I guess, maximising my potential by coming into the gym and doing the work that I needed to do.

'I ended up having a few niggles here and there – a few little injuries which, had I let them go on longer, could have turned into serious issues that could have put me out for a while.

'So it was definitely out of necessity that I started – for injury prevention more than anything else. Then the more you get into, you find yourself wanting to get stronger. You want to see what your limits are and to test your body physically. I really started to get into it and it became part of my lifestyle. Up to that point it hadn't been – I'd just played golf without really training much or watching what I ate. Now, obviously, things are very different.

'It took me four years of training to get my body into the best possible shape for what I do, which ultimately is go out and play golf. I have no ambitions to try and squat 500 pounds like some guys do but I do enough and I'm strong enough to control the golf club the whole way through my swing – that's basically what I need to do.

'For some people [going to the gym] it's just looking in the mirror and feeling better about themselves, or tracking their numbers – lifting bigger, lifting heavier, being able to do more reps with more weight or whatever it is.

'But for me it was being able to stand up, hit 50 drivers in a row and feel no pain in my back. That is what made me realise that training is something I need to do – I need to do this a lot, and if I want to prolong my career as much as I can, I need to keep doing it.'

Since 2010 he has worked closely with Dr Steve McGregor, who masterminded Man City's fitness programme

McGregor devises programmes that stretch between six to eight weeks in order to get McIlroy in the best possible shape for major tournaments, with the focus on adding stability, strength and power.

During tournament week, McGregor attempts to control McIlroy's desire to post a workout. The superstar will train, on top of his practice range sessions, nearly every day bar the tournament-ending Sunday.

At last year's Open at Hoylake, McGregor made McIlroy a deal that he could do a gym session if he shot a round of 67. McIlroy carded a 66.

'I'll do my heavier sessions on Monday and Tuesday, maybe take a day off, and then do a couple of lighter ones over the course of the Thursday, Friday and Saturday,' said McIlroy.

'I'll always give myself Sunday off just as it's the last day of the tournament – maybe I'll go in if I feel like some sort of warm-up session, but nothing more. So two heavier sessions and two lighter sessions.'

McIlroy believes his preparation for Augusta has been perfect and the man who finished runner-up to Formula One king Lewis Hamilton at last year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year contest is confident that he stands a good chance of triumphing in Georgia.

'Obviously it's the first really big tournament of the year and it's even bigger for me this time round for a few different reasons,' he added.

'I think I've had a good build-up to it.

'We try to put a lot of work into it at the start of the year, around January and February time, going through different phases of training. Endurance at the start, and then more into a strength phase, before maybe tapering off a little bit in the lead up to the Masters.

'We still work hard the week before but then the week of the tournament we try to taper it down so that I know I'm in great shape and I know I'm ready. I'll have done the volume, I'll have done the workload and I'll just be ready to go out and play.'

Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam... now is it time for McIlroy to become the next British champion of the Masters?

Indeed, the nation hopes the hard work will ultimately pay off.

A grand slam and golf folklore awaits if McIlroy can finally lift the big one.
