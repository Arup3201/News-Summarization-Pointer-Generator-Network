After Manchester United's fourth Premier League win on the spin, Louis van Gaal was understandably in a jovial mood on Tuesday night.

The Dutch boss was pictured posing for photographs and signing autographs for fans outside Old Trafford two hours after the final whistle of United's 2-1 win against Stoke.

The United supporters lucky enough to spot Van Gaal wandering out of the stadium looked as though they couldn't believe their luck as the former Barcelona boss obliged with a selfie or two.

Van Gaal gives a thumbs up to the fans ahead of Manchester United's 2-1 win against Stoke

After a difficult start to his reign as Untied boss, Van Gaal has now steered his side to withing two points of second-place Manchester City, who face a trip to Sunderland on Wednesday evening.

United's 2-1 victory against Stoke saw Marouane Fellaini score his second goal of the season with a first half header before a powerful Steven N'Zonzi drive pulled the Potters level in the 39th minute.

Former Chelsea winger Juan Mata put Van Gaal's side back in front after his long range free-kick evaded everyone in the Stoke box before drifting past Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal.

Speaking after the game, Van Gaal said: 'The fighting spirit is fantastic when you see the team, and that is why the fans are also excited.

‘We have come back from bad results many times and against Stoke the referee should have whistled at 1-0 (when Assaidi challenged Fellaini) but he didn’t and they scored. But we fought back again and fought til the end when we also had the long balls to Mr (Peter) Crouch, and we have survived.

‘It is good for the players, the team and for me, and the party we have tomorrow (Wednesday)’

‘I was not happy with the performance in the first half, we were not aggressive enough, and the last few moments were not necessary.’

Juan Mata's second half free-kick was enough to hand United three points at Old Trafford
