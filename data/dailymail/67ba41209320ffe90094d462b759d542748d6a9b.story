Brief encounter: John Paul II with the Queen in 1982

It was a historic occasion as the Queen welcomed the first reigning Pope to visit Britain in 1982.

But the visit of John Paul II – whose modernising style and charisma gave him ‘pop star’ like popularity – was dogged by bitter diplomatic wrangles over his meetings with Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher.

The Pontiff’s reluctance to spend time with the Queen and the then Prime Minister sparked a row with ‘high-handed’ Vatican officials, according to Foreign Office papers obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws.

A document from the run-up to the visit, dated December 15, 1981, reveals the concerns of the Pope’s advisers.

It states: ‘As regards a call at the Palace, the Pope would be unlikely to accept an invitation to lunch with the Queen. To do so could set an unwelcome precedent in that the Pope would be obliged to accept similar invitations for heads of state in whichever countries he visited.’

The Queen did meet the Pope during the six-day tour of Britain, but she had to be content with a 30-minute private meeting which the Pope fitted in between public engagements on the day he arrived, May 28, 1982.

A meeting with Mrs Thatcher proved even more problematic. At an early planning meeting the Foreign Office was ‘keen to put down a marker to the effect that the Prime Minister has expressed a desire to offer some sort of entertainment to the Pope’.

But the Archbishop of Westminster – one of Britain’s most senior Roman Catholics – poured cold water on the idea.

The minutes state: ‘The Archbishop emphasised the Pope would not wish to neglect any of the proper courtesies, but the programme was going to be extremely crowded.

‘He wondered whether the proper degree of contact could be achieved if she came to the reception he was to give on Day Two and a room was provided where they could have a tete a tete meeting.’

Mrs Thatcher feared the lack of a formal private meeting would be seen as a snub, a Foreign Office memo from November 20, 1981 reveals, saying: ‘The Prime Minister would think it was liable to excite adverse comment if contact between her and the Pope were limited to a handshake during a large reception.’

One memo in the files states: ‘Concerned to hear of some evidence of high-handedness in Papal entourage.’

The documents from 1981 do not detail why the Pope may have been reluctant to meet the Prime Minister, although one memo refers to ‘current Irish developments’.

It is known that the Pope was concerned about the treatment of the IRA hunger strikers who were protesting in 1981.
