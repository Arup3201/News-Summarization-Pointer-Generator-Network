QPR defender Steven Caulker was handcuffed by police after being accused of stealing a tub of £1.85 soft cheese from Tesco.

Caulker had left the store in Weybridge, Surrey and was about to go back in when he was handcuffed by officers.

Witnesses say they heard the officers and the 22-year-old, who is thought to earn around £42,000 a week, talking about the cheese spread Philadelphia.

It is thought police spent five minutes with Caulker before he was released.

One passer-by who saw the incident told the Sun: 'Caulker had left the Tesco Express then turned around and gone back in.

'That was when the police car arrived, jumping from their squad car and handcuffing him.'

While another added: 'There were a group of lads watching from across the street who immediately recognised him - and thought it was hilarious.'

However, Surrey Police confirmed that no crime had been committed and a force spokesman said: 'It appears to have been a misunderstanding between staff about payment.'

Both Caulker and QPR refused to comment.

Mr Caulker, an England international, made his moved to QPR in the summer after also being chased by Crystal Palace.

He made the £8million move from Cardiff City, despite Palace matching the fee and offering wages of around £42,000 a week.

But it is thought he opted to join QPR when they bettered the terms.
