The Financial Fair Play battleground in the Premier League is likely to become considerably more messy after a special summit at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on Monday.

Clubs with huge debts, such as Manchester United, might find themselves under the microscope during the next stage of FFP, which is due to be discussed at the meeting.

UEFA president Michel Platini has gathered all those involved in FFP — including Manchester City, who have had £50m worth of sanctions imposed for their overspending — to talk about how to refine the controversial legislation.

UEFA chief Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the issue of debt is expected to be raised again

UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino confirmed at Leaders in Sport that the debt issue may be on the agenda next week and the European Clubs Association also say they expect it to be raised.

City will stress their zero-debt status and push the case for sustainable investment spending rather than try to shift the spotlight on to their Manchester neighbours, who still owe £350m from the Glazer family’s leveraged purchase of the club.

Nevertheless City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak did highlight the differences between the two clubs when he pointedly said: ‘We have a sustainable project. We have zero debt. We don’t pay a penny to service any debt.’

Malcolm Glazer first bought a stake in Manchester United in 2003. He and his family continued to buy them until 2005, when they launched a successful £800million takeover of the club. Most of their capital came in the form of loans, which were secured against the club's assets, meaning United were liable for the interest payments. Despite being one of the most profitable clubs on earth, they are still hundreds of millions of pounds in debt.

Disgruntled supporters set up FC United of Manchester in 2005 in protest at the Glazers' ownership. The Green and Gold campaign was also a high-profile protest movement.
