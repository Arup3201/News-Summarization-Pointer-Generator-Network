A mother was left stunned when she logged on to Facebook to find a message from the son she had given up for adoption over 30 years ago.

Pat Corlett, from Liverpool, was contacted by 36-year-old Chris Haworth - who she had not seen since he was six days old - on the social networking site last year.

The message began 'Hi my name is Chris and I was born on 
22nd June 1975.' He then went on to ask her to contact him but added, 'You 
may not want to reply to this.'

Pat, 54, who works as a courier for the Probation Service, said: 'It was like a bomb going off, but a nice bomb.'

Reunited: Chris Haworth, who works as a coach driver, traced his birth mother Pat Corlett through Social Services, and then contacted her via Facebook

When she responded she asked him what name she had given him at birth - and knew she had found her son when he replied, 'David'.

She discovered that Chris - who kept his birth name as a middle name - worked as a coach driver and had enjoyed a happy childhood in the Lakes after being adopted.

And the arrival back in her life of her first-born has special resonance
for Pat, who went on to have two more sons.

Eight years ago her youngest boy, Michael, died at the age of just seven after losing a battle 
with cancer.

'Chris coming back in our lives is like the rounding off of a story,' Pat said. 'He 
can never replace Michael, of course, but to have him with us is a real 
happy ending.'

Pat revealed that she had always wanted to trace Chris - but he beat her to it, enlisting the help of Social Services before he finally managed to pinpoint her on Facebook.

'I always said I'd never trace him, that it might be too disruptive for 
him or upsetting, but I often wondered whether he would try to find me,' Pat said.

'The answer came via that message on Facebook and it was overwhelming.'

Pat first became pregnant when she was 18 and working away from home in a Lake District guest house.

'I was in a relationship that I thought would work out,' she explained.

But the couple parted and it was only after the split that Pat found 
herself pregnant. Aware that the relationship would not last she did not tell her boyfriend about the baby.

'I was facing being on my own with a child and it was daunting,' she said. 'Back 
then, in 1975, single mothers were viewed very differently to how they 
are now; there was a stigma.

'Plus, I just didn't know how I would be able to work and look after a baby,' Pat admitted. 'I was brought up in Liverpool as an only child in an all-female 
household with my mum and my great aunt who held a lot of Victorian 
views and values.

"They were also very active in the church and the community. There was no way I could go home pregnant.

'It was daunting to think about keeping the baby but equally daunting thinking about giving him away."

She gave birth to her son in a hospital in 
Barrow and stayed with him for six days before handing him over to 
adoption authorities - admitting she did not want him to have the same kind of upbringing as she had experienced.

'My mother went to work in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and met my 
father who was from the Belgian Congo. They later divorced and we lost 
contact so I never knew him.

'I didn't want that for my son. I wanted him to have a mum and dad. I was very upset but I'd made the decision.'

Pat went on to marry her husband of 33 years 
Bob, who she told about her adopted son - but they faced an uphill struggle to conceive a child of their own.

Together again: Chris - who was called David at birth - has met up with Pat and her 18-year-old son Andrew (left) whom she had with husband Bob

'It was especially painful, of course, because of the baby I had given 
up,' Pat said. 'I thought about him every day, especially as we were trying so hard 
to have children.In the end we started to look into adoption."

Eventually, 14 years after they had married, Pat fell pregnant with their oldest son Andrew, who is now 18, and had Michael three years later.

But in 2003 their younger son was diagnosed with Burkett's 
lymphoma. After battling a series of illnesses, including a stroke and 
septicaemia, he finally succumbed to his illness and he died aged just 
seven.

'Andrew was only a child at the time and I remember him asking: 'can't I have another brother?'

'By the time he was 15 or so he asked again about whether we might adopt
and it was then that I told him he did have another, much older, 
brother somewhere else but I would never trace him.

'I didn't even know if he'd been told he was adopted; I just felt it might open a can of worms.'

Pat admitted that finding the Facebook message from Chris had left her 'stunned' - and that she was even more nervous when they finally arranged to meet.

'It was a strange feeling,' she said. 'I was excited but not overly so. I wondered 
whether he would like me, whether he'd like my husband and son and I 
worried about the complications it might bring.'

"I was very nervous but we all just got on like a house on fire. It was fantastic. And the boys get along wonderfully.'

'Of course there are times when I wish I could turn the clock back,' she added. 'I wish Chris could have met my mum and Michael.

'But I have a son back. I feel very blessed."
