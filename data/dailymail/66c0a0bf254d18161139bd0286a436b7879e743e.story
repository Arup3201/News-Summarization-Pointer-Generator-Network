Former Arsenal star Freddie Ljungberg married his partner and Tottenham Hotspur fan Natalie Foster on Saturday.

Ljungberg, the 37-year-old midfielder who retired in 2012, tied the knot to 26-year-old Foster in a glittering ceremony.

Former Gunners team-mate Tony Adams was among the guests at London's Natural History Museum.

Foster, a 
supporter of Arsenal's bitter rivals Spurs, is the daughter of London 
taxi tycoon Daryl Foster and met Ljungberg in 2007 while he was playing 
at West Ham.

Ljungberg
 scored 46 goals in 216 appearances for Arsenal between 1998 and 2007 
and took on an ambassadorial role at the Emirates last year.

The Swede won two Premier League titles and three FA Cups during his nine years at the club.
