Born into a family of respected lawyers and academics, Rupert Ross had all the advantages his privileged background could provide.

But the former public schoolboy turned his back on his fortunate past to embrace the underworld and become a gangster.

Today he faces life in prison after being convicted with an accomplice of murdering a rival drug dealer in a daylight assassination at the gates of Britain’s largest prison.

Senior detectives said Ross ‘lost sight of reality’ as he plunged into the violent depths of West London’s criminal underworld.

His mother, who runs the Ad Hoc 
boutique on Chelsea’s King’s Road where clients include Katie Price and 
Megan Fox, has been left reeling by courtroom revelations about the 
bloodthirsty killing.

They included a diary in which Ross 
said he ‘lived a fast life, hectic, lots of wars over drugs and money, 
one or two shoot-outs’.

His aunt, a prominent criminal QC who 
offered a large cash surety to get him bail, had no idea of the scale of
his violent lifestyle.

But his grandfather Herbert Lank, a retired Cambridge don and internationally respected art restorer, has cast him adrift.

Darcy Austin-Bruce was shot five times outside Wandsworth prison in south London

Ross, 30, shouted ‘I love you Mum, be 
strong’ to Diana Lank, 55, as he was led to the cells after being 
convicted of murder at the Old Bailey. She was duped into storing a 
bullet-proof vest at her £700,000 Fulham home that proved to be a vital 
part of the case against her son.

Forensic tests revealed it was covered
in gunshot residue with the same chemical composition of the bullets 
used to kill 20-year-old Darcy Austin-Bruce.

Police never recovered the stolen scooter, murder weapon or distinctive smart suits used by the killer and his accomplice.

Ross dressed like a lawyer when he approached his victim outside Wandsworth Prison in south-west London in May 2009.

He pulled out a handgun and fired five times at close range.

Ross, who was also wearing a crash 
helmet, then ran to a waiting moped ridden by 34-year-old fireman and 
convicted drug dealer Leon De St Aubin.

The two men sped away as Austin-Bruce, a former Fulham FC academy player, bled to death in the arms of prison medics.

The Old Bailey heard the men had once been friends but had fallen out and the shooting was the culmination of a drugs feud.

The assassins took revenge days after 
Mr Austin-Bruce and another man fired a gun at a car in which they were 
travelling. The opportunity for murder was set up by a prisoner who used
an illicit mobile phone to tip off Ross that Mr Austin-Bruce was due to
visit a man on his wing.

Detectives later found notes that 
Ross, a former pupil at £30,000-a-year Dulwich College, wrote as part of
his treatment during a stay at a luxury drug rehabilitation centre, 
paid for by his family.

He wrote: ‘I still want the gangster 
life and end up dealing again. My dealing was making good money and I 
was living a fast life. Life was very hectic. Lots of wars over drugs 
and money one or two shoot-outs.’

Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said: 
‘Here is Rupert Ross, out of his own pen, admitting being involved in 
drug dealing – and not small scale cannabis supply but drugs of 
sufficient importance to engender “lots of wars”.’

Mr Aylett said the killing of Austin-Bruce was a ‘murder of quite breathtaking audacity’.

Fellow pupils at Dulwich College, from
which Ross was expelled, remembered him as a ‘wannabe gangster’ who 
adopted a strong London accent and hung out with minor criminals.

In a shocking symbol of the culture of
violence surrounding the men, a second victim was shot dead on the eve 
of Mr Austin-Bruce’s funeral.

No one has ever been charged with the 
murder of Anthony Otton, 28, a close friend of Ross and De St Aubin.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Brian Lucas, of the Met’s Trident gun 
crime unit, said: ‘These men were living violent and criminal lives to 
the extent that they believed they could get away with killing a man in 
broad daylight as revenge for a petty argument.

‘They had lost sight of reality and 
now face the consequences of their sad and violent choices. They can no 
longer delude themselves of their “gangster” status.’

De St Aubin and Ross, both of Fulham, face life imprisonment when they are sentenced by Judge Martin Stephens QC today.
