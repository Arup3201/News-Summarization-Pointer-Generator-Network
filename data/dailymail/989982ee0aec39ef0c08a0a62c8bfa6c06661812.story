A 17-year-old girl is recovering  after a buck struck her car while she was driving and impaled her jaw bone with its antler.

High school senior Tori Henry needed five-hour surgery after the freak accident in Jonesboro, Arkansas last Wednesday but is expected to leave the hospital today.

The teenager was driving on one of the city's busiest streets when the five-point buck tried to jump over her car - but smashed into the driver's window and impaled her face with its antler.

Despite the terrifying experience, Tori stayed surprisingly calm, her mother told KAIT.

'She kept her composure after the deer hit her and drove and parked her car so no one else would get hurt,' her proud mom, Nikki Winn, said.

She was airlifted to The Med in Memphis and was later transferred to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, where she underwent surgery.

The images of her sporting a swollen cheek as she recovers in hospital are a far cry from smiling photos she took just a week before, when she was voted to be part of Homecoming court at Paragould High School. 

Still, the teenager has shown her strength and recently enjoyed a hospital visit from Elsa the Snow Queen from Frozen, who lifted her spirits by presenting her with a tiara and gifts, her mother said.

'Tori is the person that is kind to everyone.' she said.

'With her from now on, I'm not sweating the small things. I'm just going to be happy that she is here and hug her every day.'

On Facebook she added that, while her daughter is improving physically, she is still suffering emotionally from the shock. 

Winn added that her daughter would be going home on Tuesday.
