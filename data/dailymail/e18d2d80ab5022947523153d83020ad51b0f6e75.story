One of the First World War’s defining moments is to be remembered by the whole of English football in December.

The iconic Christmas truce match in 1914 – during which rival soldiers put down their weapons – is being marked a century on up and down the country.

Every Premier League, Championship and FA Cup second round fixture will be preceded by commemorative photos, with both sides posing alongside each other, which will be put on to a website which will also involve schools, fans and amateur teams.

On Christmas Day, 1914, British and German troops in Flanders, Belgium, put down their weapons and mingled in No-Man's Land. 

The most famous event of this day was the game of football played between the two sets of soldiers.

The match reportedly started when a football was kicked by one of the British troops into No Man's Land. 

A memorial to the Christmas Truce will also be unveiled - designed by a 10-year-old Spencer Turner from Newcastle, who won a national competition. It will reside permanently at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

Spencer was told he had won the competition by Newcastle stars Steven Taylor and Adam Armstrong during a special assembley at his school Farne Primary on Thursday. 

The competition was judged by Prince William, president of the FA, and Arsenal forward Theo Walcott.

Two Premier League clubs will send youth teams to the Christmas Truce International Tournament in Ypres which features French, German, Belgian, Scottish and Austrian teams.

The 'Football Remembers Week' will take place from December 6-14 and is a joint initiative between the Premier League, the FA, the Football League and the British Council.
