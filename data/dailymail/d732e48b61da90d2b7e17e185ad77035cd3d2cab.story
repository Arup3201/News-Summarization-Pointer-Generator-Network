A four-year-old girl was hailed a hero today after calling police when a bookshelf collapsed on her mother, knocking her unconscious.

Lexi Cooper refused to panic when her mother Nicola Ellis, 25, was knocked out at bedtime by the bookshelf falling off the wall and trapping her underneath.

The child, who is in reception class in primary school, switched on a Simpsons cartoon DVD for her younger brother and sister, found her mother’s mobile in another room, dialled 999 and gave full details of herself, family and home address.

Cool as a cucumber: Lexi Cooper, aged four, saves her mother's life in a seven minute call to the emergency services

During the call, lasting more than 
seven minutes, Lexi said her mother was 'asleep' and 'a shelf had fallen
 down'. She said she could clamber over the bookcase to get to the front
 door.

She said she had tried to 'wake' her mother, before being overheard shouting ‘wake up mummy' at the request of the operator.

As police and paramedics rushed to the house near Blackburn, Lancashire, Lexi said: 'I’ll open the front door, over that thing.

'I
 can usually get over it. I’m bigger than my brother and sister. I’m by 
the front door.' She was waiting on the doorstep as police arrived.

Nicola
 was rushed to Royal Blackburn Hospital where she was treated for a 
dislocated shoulder, neck, wrist and pelvis injuries following the 
incident on December 5. She has since made a near full recovery, apart 
from suffering with concussion.

Today
 Lexi, who has been given a police commendation, said: 'I just phoned 
999 like they told us at school. I was shouting "wake-up mummy, wake up 
mummy". She was under the bookcase and I had to climb over her.

'I
 have always been a good, big girl and I didn’t cry. I put the Simpsons 
on for my brother and sister and I was very calm and I was like mummy. I
 let the ambulance men in and they went upstairs and made mummy better.'

Proud mother Nicola with Lexi, who was hailed a hero by police for her quick actions in helping her mother and comforting her siblings

Nicola said: 'Lexi is so clever - I owe her everything and my life. She was just fantastic.

'I could have been under that bookshelf for hours or even the night. I am just so thankful and proud of Lexi for what she did.

'She
 stayed very calm and was very brave to ring 999 to get help. She had 
recently had a talk at school about the emergency services which meant 
she knew what to do in this situation.'

Nicola
 said she was at home with Lexi, along with her two other children 
two-year-old Harry and one-year-old Amelia, where she was tidying things
 away on a bookcase in Lexi’s bedroom.

The bookcase stuffed with Lexi”s favourite Disney books and DVDs then fell on top of Nicola.

Nicola added: 'It hit me on the front of my head, it must have been more than six foot high.

'I
 didn’t even feel the impact of the shelf hitting me. I collapsed and 
was out cold under the bookcase. It was a heavy old thing.

'Lexi told the operator that mummy was just lying there. She was on the phone to the operator for over seven minutes.

'I
 had never taught her our address but she had heard me tell taxis where 
to take us. She is very nosey and obviously when I said the address she 
had remembered it.'

Little Lexi on her toy phone, but when it came to making an important call on the real thing, she showed a maturity way beyond her years.

Lexi was given a commendation for her bravery by Lancashire Police Commander Ch Supt Chris Bithell, and the Mayor of Blackburn, Councillor Salim Mulla.

Contact centre agent Sophie Roscoe, who fielded the 999 phone call, was also presented with a commendation for her professionalism in handling the call, keeping Lexi calm and talking until help arrived.

Sophie said: 'It was Lexi who was the real star. She was absolutely fantastic and that call will stay with me.

'Despite the awful situation, and her two siblings beside her, she remained focused throughout and adhered to every instruction that I gave her. I honestly can’t believe that someone so young could be so truly fantastic.'

Ch Supt Chris Bithell said: 'Lexi gave excellent commentary to the call operator and followed all the instructions she was given, remaining on the phone until the police, who were first at the scene, arrived. She even opened the door for them.

'I think this incident is a good opportunity for parents to remind their children of the importance of knowing when to ring the emergency services should the appropriate situation arise.'

Here's the edited transcript of Lexi's cool-as-a-cucumber call to the emergency services:

Lexi said: 'I just called 999 like they told us to do at school.' But she also distracted her younger siblings by putting on a Simpsons DVD, before the ambulance arrived.

Operator: Lexi, just touch mummy’s hand is she cold or is she warm?

Child: My mum feels a bit warm.

Operator: Lexi, go to the front door for me. Is a police officer there?

Child: I’ll open the front door, over that thing. I can usually get over it.

Operator: Good girl.

(As policeman arrives at the house) Operator: All right. Good girl. I’ll let you go.

Operator: Alright then, bye bye.
