A double-amputee Iraq War veteran who was hurled off a towering rollercoaster to his death never should have been allowed on the ride, it has emerged.

Signs at the Ride of Steel roller 
coaster at Darien Lake Theme Park in Syracuse, clearly state riders 
'must have two legs' - but park operators will face no criminal charges despite violating their own policy.

Sergeant James Hackemer, 29, was visiting the park with his daughters, sisters and other members of 
the family. He was on the ride with his nephew, Ashton, a sophomore at 
the University at Buffalo, when the tragic accident happened.

He fell about 150 feet and landed on a grassy area at the park, which is between Rochester and Buffalo.

Genesee County Sheriff Gary Maha said: 'He didn't have the physical attributes to hold him in.'

Investigators found no criminal activity, including intent.

Yet the ride operators, who were not identified, 'clearly knew' Hackemer shouldn't have been riding but offered no explanation for why they let him on.

'Darien Lake violated their own policies and procedures by letting him get on the ride,' Maha said.

A promotional photograph taken automatically shows Hackemer's college-age nephew, Ashton Luffred, looking straight ahead in the moments after the accident, his face without expression and his hands on the safety bar in front of him. Authorities aren't releasing the photo.

Maha said Luffred was in a state of shock after the accident but told police Hackemer didn't say anything to indicate he was worried about falling off the ride.

Maha said park operators clearly violated policy by letting Hackemer on the ride but won't face criminal charges.

Civil liability could be determined later if a lawsuit is filed, he said. Hackemer's relatives have said they do not hold the theme park responsible.

Maha said the state labor department is still investigating the mechanics and safety of the ride but have indicated to him that the coaster was operating correctly.

Hackemer was missing all of his left leg and most of his right leg and was not wearing prosthetic limbs when he was thrown from the ride.

The 29-year-old father of two had lost both his legs to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2008 and was on a family outing when the accident happened.

A funeral service for Hackemer is planned for Thursday in his hometown of Gowanda. He will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

The car pulled into the loading station with the lap bar and seatbelt still in place, Maha said.

The ride is still closed pending the state labor department probe.
