The wife of a Georgia police chief is fighting for her life after her husband shot her at their quaint home, just a few hours into the New Year.

At a Thursday afternoon press conference, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities identified the  shooter as local Police Chief William McCollom, 57, and the victim as his 58-year-old wife Margaret. 

The incident happened just after 4am, when officers received a call from the chief, saying he accidentally shot his wife at their home on Autumn Leaf using his service handgun, a Glock 17 9mm.

What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom (right) shot his wife inside their home early New Year's Day. His wife Margaret (left) was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center

Scene: McCollom allegedly called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife

Investigators say the woman was shot in the home's bedroom.  

It was initially reported that the chief shot her two times, according to the 911 recording, but authorities now say she was shot just once. 

Margaret was flown by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was still listed in critical condition Thursday afternoon.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is taking over the case, and will file a report on the shooting to the District Attorney's office which will decide whether to press charges.

GBI Director Sherry Lang said the police chief is being fully cooperative with the investigation. 

Meanwhile, McCollom has since been placed on paid administrative leave by the City Manager, pending an internal review. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said  McCollom has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He had only officially been in the position for two months, but took over as interim police chief in July when the previous chief stepped down.

Happy couple? One of the McCollom's neighbors described them as 'loving' and that he has 'never seen any problems over there'.

Before that, he served as assistant chief and joined the department in 2012. 

According to Mrs McCollom's Facebook, she is licensed practical nurse who used to work in an emergency room.  

A neighbor who lives across the street from the McColloms described them as a 'loving couple' who 'do a lot of things together' and that he says he has 'never seen any problems over there', according to Fox. 

Peachtree City Police Lt Mark Brown said the department is 'hurting' after the incident and concerned for both the chief and his wife. 

Lt Brown said the chief was 'well like and well loved' around the department.
