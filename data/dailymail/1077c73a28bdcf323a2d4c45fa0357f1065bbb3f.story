Forecasters say Hurricane Gonzalo has strengthened overnight and is once again a dangerous Category 4 storm as it barrels toward the small British island territory of Bermuda.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says Gonzalo reached Category 4 strength early on Thursday for the second time in two days while fluctuating in intensity.

It says Gonzalo is howling with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph  and is centered about 540 miles south-southwest of Bermuda.

Forecasters say Hurricane Gonzalo has strengthened overnight and is once again a dangerous Category 4 storm as it barrels toward the small British island territory of Bermuda

Hurricane Gonzalo has top sustained winds near 125 mph and was centered about 555 miles south south-west of Bermuda in the early hours of Thursday morning

This satellite image shows Hurricane Gonzalo with maximum sustained winds of 125 miles per hour currently moving northward at 9 miles per hour. Gonzalo is threatening Bermuda with heavy storms and high wind gusts sometime on Friday

The storm is moving toward the north at 9 mph toward Bermuda, where a hurricane warning is in effect as the territory rushes to batten down.

The hurricane center says the eye of Gonzalo is expected to pass near Bermuda sometime Friday, and a dangerous storm surge is expected along with heavy rainfall.

Florida looks set to avoid the severe weather, reports the Sun Sentinel, although it could generate large swells and an increased risk of rip currents later in the week.

After smashing into Bermuda, Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada by late Saturday.

Gonzalo is the Atlantic's first Category 4 hurricane since October 2011 when Hurricane Ophelia's winds reached 140 mph, according to Jeff Masters, a hurricane expert with private forecaster Weather Underground.

Hurricane Gonzalo briefly reached Category 4 status on Wednesday but dropped back to a Category 3 by the evening as it continued to move away from the northern Caribbean, forecasters said. 

It is expected to see slow weakening on Thursday night, with steadier weakening starting by late Friday.

Gonzalo is the sixth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic season, which runs through to the end of November. Forecasters in August predicted lower-than-usual activity for the season, with seven to 12 named storms and no more than two reaching major hurricane status.

A major hurricane is considered to be Category 3 or above with winds hitting at least 111 mph.

Gonzalo has already swept by the eastern Caribbean earlier this week. It has uprooted trees, downed power lines and damaged scores of boats in the Caribbean islands of Antigua, St Maarten, and Martinique, according to local authorities and media reports. 

An 87-year-old sailor in St Maarten died after his boat sank in a marina where 37 vessels were damaged, the Daily Herald reported. Two people are missing, one in St. Martin and the other in St. Barts.

After smashing into Bermuda, Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada by late Saturday, although by then it will have been downgraded to a Category 1 storm

Bermuda's residents are already having to cope with the aftermath of Sunday's Tropical Storm Fay.

More than 1,000 homes remain without power and homeowners are working to repair damaged roofs. The government called out 200 soldiers of the Bermuda Regiment to help with cleanup efforts on the island of roughly 70,000 people.

On Wednesday, people stripped the island's hardware stores of generators, batteries, candles and other items and picked up free tarpaulins distributed by the government. Supermarkets and gas stations are braced for more crowds on Thursday.

'We sold out of generators [Tuesday], and items like batteries, tarp and ropes have been flying off the shelf,' Mark Stearns, a hardware store general manager, said. 'Everything that is on the hurricane list has been going fast and furious. People are definitely nervous about this storm.'

Flights out of Bermuda are fully booked for the rest of the week and hardware stores were inundated with shoppers, the Royal Gazette reported.  

Bermuda, which is 850 miles east of the U.S. state of South Carolina, has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world and its strict building codes make structures particularly capable of withstanding storms.
