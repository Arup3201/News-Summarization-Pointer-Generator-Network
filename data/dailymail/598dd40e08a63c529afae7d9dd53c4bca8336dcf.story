A husband watched in horror as his wife plunged 200ft to her death as she slipped out of a parasailing harness beside him.

Kathleen, 28, and Stephen Miskell, 31, from Connecticut, were strapped together in tandem 200ft above the Atlantic Ocean, off Pompano Beach, Florida, when Kathleen slipped from her harness.

Stephen helplessly watched as his wife plummeted into the water, where she was found floating face down around 3:15pm.

Tragic: A Connecticut couple's vacation has ended in tragedy when the two went parasailing over the ocean off Pompano Beach. Kathleen Miskell, 28, right, slipped out of the tandem harness she shared with her husband Stephen, left

Snapped: Stephen watched in horror as his wife plummeted into the water, where she was found floating face down around 3:15pm

Stephen was quickly reeled in by the boat operators, according to the Sun Sentinel, who then swerved around to recover Kathleen.

She was pulled from the water and the operators frantically performed CPR, but it was too late.

Mrs Miskell was transported to Broward Health North hospital where she was pronounced dead.

She had suffered cardiac arrest, Pompano Fire Rescue spokeswoman Sandra King said to the paper.

They were married on October 3, 2009 
Connecticut. He is originally from Galway, Ireland, and she was from 
Manchester, Connecticut. He owns his own tiling company and she works in the local school district.

Mr Miskell declined to comment to the MailOnline.

The couple was on an excursion with Wave Blast Water Sports, which operates out of the Sands Hotel.

They advertise on their website: 'Fly high above the tropical blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Get  a birds eye view of the cities [sic] skyline, white sand beaches, and the  famous lighthouse point.'

'We really don't know what happened,' an employee of the company named Brandon told the MailOnline. 'It's hard to talk about it.'

Friends and family of the couple are still reeling from news of the accident.

'For [Stephen] to go through watching her fall and then trying to get her, it had to be really devastating for him,' said friend Jim Flynn to the Miami Herald.

He said the couple had just bought a house together.

Kathleen’s sister Erin Mulcahy was shocked to learn about the fatal accident.

'She was my everything,' Miss Mulcahy said.

This is the second parasailing death at Pompano Beach in the past five years.

In 2007, Amber May White, was parasailing with her sister when the line broke in high winds and the girls were slammed on to the roof of a hotel.

Mayor Lamar Fisher said that this incident is cause for tighter regulations of the parasailing industry.

'This
is accident number two in the city of Pompano Beach,' said Mayor 
Fisher, 'so we want to do anything we can as a city to make sure 
legislation is put in place so these posts, these harnesses can be 
inspected on a regular basis, and right now that's not occurring, and 
that's what upsets us, so something has to be done.'

Rescue: She had suffered cardiac arrest

There are no state or federal regulations to address the parasailling industry, the Miami Herald reports.

The boats are licenses by the regulations that apply to commercial vessels while the parasails are considered 'kites' by the Federal Aviation Commission.

There are no standards for the harnesses, towlines or other equipment.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates that there are 70 to 120 commercial parasailing companies in Florida.

Since 2001, four parasailers were killed in the state. Legislation aimed at regulating the industry has repeatedly failed to pass.
