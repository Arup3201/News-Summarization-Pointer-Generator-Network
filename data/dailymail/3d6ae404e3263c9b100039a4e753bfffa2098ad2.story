Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant has admitted that the thought of retiring after this season has crossed his mind.

Bryant currently has another 12 months to run on a two-year contract extension he signed with the Western Conference franchise back in 2013, worth £32million.

When asked whether he has considered retiring after this season, Bryant nodded and told a Los Angeles Times report, 'I'd be lying if I said that it hasn't crossed my mind. Right now I doubt it... but anything's possible.'

'My body is hurting like crazy, around the clock, and if I don't want to do this anymore, I won't do it,' he said.

The 36-year-old endured a nightmare campaign with the Lakers last year as a knee injury in December curtailed his involvement for the remainder of the season - while his side failed to reach the play-offs.

The 16-time All-Star guard has since made a complete recovery and, under head coach Byron Scott, has played in 34 of Los Angeles' 41 games - sitting some out to rest.

If the five-time NBA champion were to retire and leave the Staples Center this season, he would waiver away £16.5m from his contract.

Bryant is averaging 22.6 points, 5.7 assists and 5.6 rebounds this season in 34.6 minutes per game.

The Lakers sit second bottom in the Western Conference standings with an undesirable win-loss record of 12-29 ahead of their trip to the Phoenix Suns in their next fixture on Monday night.
