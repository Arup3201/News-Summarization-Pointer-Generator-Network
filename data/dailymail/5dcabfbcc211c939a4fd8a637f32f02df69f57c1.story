As a maternity nurse to the stars, Rachel Waddilove has cared for countless celebrity babies, with actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Minnie Driver among her clients.

Paltrow credits Waddilove with helping her daughter Apple sleep through the night at just six weeks old. Driver, who is a single mother, praised her extraordinary ‘calmness and knowledge’.

And now Waddilove, who charges £280 for a 24-hour home visit, has written a book to teach those of us not blessed with an  A-list budget how to get a child to sleep.

It was a pressing issue for me last month: my son Felix was three weeks old and I hadn’t had more than two hours of uninterrupted sleep since his arrival.

Coupled with the exertions of caring  for my boisterous two-year-old daughter Rosie, tiredness was transforming me into a wreck. So I was eager to meet Waddilove and road-test her methods. Could she turn my unsettled newborn into a sleeping-through-the-night miracle?

Waddilove’s advice is based on the way she brought up her three children in the Seventies. She believes babies today are given the status of ‘King Pin’, with their mother’s wellbeing often neglected.

She suggests three-hour feeding routines, leaving your baby to cry, introducing a bottle, and even putting the baby in a separate room overnight.

‘Mothers are fed too much worry nowadays. I’m strict about them getting rest,’ says Waddilove, 65, now a grandmother of five who lives with her husband John, 75, a retired farmer, in Devon.

Unsurprisingly, those who advocate the increasingly popular ‘attachment’ style of parenting – in which babies feed and sleep whenever they choose, often sleeping in the same bed as the mother – question her Victorian-sounding methods.

So where does her approach come from? Waddilove’s own mother employed a maternity nurse to put Rachel and her five siblings on a strict routine as babies in the Forties – so this is an obvious influence.

In 1964, Waddilove trained as a maternity nurse at a Barnardo’s children’s home, where following a routine was the only way of looking after the hundreds of babies in her care. ‘It was just the way things were done,’ she says.

In the following decade, there was a backlash in parenting methods and Waddilove found herself in the minority. ‘My friends were feeding their babies on demand and they were all over the place,’ she says.

Most of my friends with babies favour 
attachment parenting. But I found myself agreeing with Waddilove’s 
methods. I was put on a routine as a baby and left to cry on occasion, 
and I don’t think it has done me any harm.

After following her book for a couple 
of weeks, I was lucky enough to be granted  a visit from the woman 
herself. Within moments of arriving at my home, she had Rosie wanting to
hold her hand and Felix fast asleep. Clearly, she has a magic touch.

The first step, Waddilove says, to get your baby to sleep is making sure they are well fed, even if that means topping up breast-feeds with the much-maligned formula. She says: ‘Anyone would think formula was poison. Babies do just as well on it.’ Waddilove said I should also be expressing milk. ‘It’s important to introduce a bottle,’ she says. ‘I do it within two weeks. It gives you flexibility and it’s good for dad to be able to feed the baby too.’

I dug out my breast pump. The more milk I pumped, the more I produced, leading to painful breasts. While Felix took to the bottle immediately, it didn’t feel fair asking my husband Chris, a financial analyst, to do overnight feeds when he had to be up at 6am.

Waddilove believes leaving even the tiniest babies to cry themselves to sleep is an essential part of teaching them healthy long-term sleeping habits.

She leaves tired newborns to have a ‘little shout’ for ten minutes before she picks them up, and has, on occasion, left young babies for up to half an hour. ‘I wouldn’t give a time limit because every baby is different, but don’t pick them up too soon or get into the habit of holding or suckling them to sleep,’ she says.

It is easier said than done. A newborn’s scream can pierce the most hardened mother’s heart, and even if – like me –  she is prepared to leave her baby to cry, she will worry about being judged by  well-meaning friends and relatives. With Rosie, I’d pick her up almost immediately.

But, bolstered by Waddilove’s words, I left Felix to cry for the first time at 1am during one particularly fractious night. With my head under the pillow, I waited for ten minutes. And he stopped. After that he had two more, shorter, crying fits until, at 1.30am, he finally gave up and went to sleep. Every minute felt interminable, and by the end I was crying too. But it worked.

‘It is incredibly upsetting,’ Waddilove acknowledges. ‘But you’re not leaving  a cold, hungry baby to scream. That’s abuse. They are fed, clean and warm.’

Waddilove believes babies should sleep and feed at about the same time every day and puts any healthy baby who weighs more than 6lb 8oz into a three-hourly routine when they are just a week old. The bigger the baby, the longer they can go between feeds. At 9lb 1oz aged three weeks, Felix could last four hours.

‘The word routine has horrible connotations but babies thrive on it,’ says Waddilove. A baby’s first feed, she says, should be at 7am. Within an hour and a half, they will be ready for a nap. Between 10am and 11am, they will feed again, before taking at least a two-hour lunchtime nap. Between 2pm and 3pm, they will have another feed, followed by another nap. After an early-evening feed at about 6pm, they will be put to bed  at 7pm. They will have a later evening feed between 10pm and 11pm and will – hopefully – sleep until the early hours.

It wasn’t exactly a schedule Felix and I were running to. I had left him to sleep until after 8am and nap intermittently in the day before cuddling him all evening. Forcing myself out of bed at 7am felt unnecessary. But it helped, because I felt I was taking control.

By 8am, Felix was yawning and he slept until 10.30am. But he didn’t always comply with Waddilove’s schedule. Sometimes he refused to sleep in the afternoon.

The evenings were the most difficult, as Felix wouldn’t sleep for more than half an hour at a time. This is common. ‘Some people carry babies round, others leave them to holler,’ says Waddilove. ‘Some feed them on and off all evening, which is not what I would do. I would tuck the baby down, have supper, maybe rock their cot, and if they haven’t settled by 9.30pm I would do another feed.’

I persevered with her suggestion of feeding, leaving to cry, picking up after ten minutes to hug and putting back in the cot, until, when Felix was five weeks old, our evenings became less fractured. He didn’t always sleep soundly, but he usually stopped crying for long enough to let us have dinner in peace.

Waddilove believes that after a month, babies should move into their own room. Even when asleep, Felix kept me awake  by grunting. I was reliant on ear plugs and my husband fled to the spare room in week one. ‘So many girls have their child in bed with them and dad sleeping in a different room,’ says Waddilove. ‘This isn’t right for family life.’

But research has shown that sleeping in the same room as your baby for their first four months reduces the risk  of cot death. ‘God forbid anything should happen but cot death is very silent. They’re not going to shout out and it won’t make any difference. When they are in a Moses basket, babies can sleep anywhere,’ Waddilove counters. ‘Put them in the bathroom.’

I put Felix in our en suite, but I lost more sleep than ever worrying that some dreadful fate should befall him, so I abandoned it after two nights.

Waddilove advocates swaddling before they are put to bed until they are three months old. Certainly, the effect of swaddling on Felix was incredible. He stopped startling himself awake and seemed more content. A month on, Felix – now nearly eight weeks – is still unsettled in the evenings but usually able to get himself back to sleep after a hug. I have learned to leave him to cry without guilt. His daytime naps are gaining structure.

Best of all has been his progress overnight. Those two-hour sleeps stretched to five and six hours. One night last week, to my joy and disbelief, he slept through to 7am. As for me, well, I’m still shattered, kept awake by the anxiety that comes with caring for a newborn. But I’m hoping that soon I will catch up on sleep, and the fog of new motherhood will lift.
