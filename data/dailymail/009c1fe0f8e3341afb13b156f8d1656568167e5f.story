A young married mother has taken her own life after struggling for years to come to terms with the death of her beloved war veteran father in a car crash. 

Maxine Zamora, 22, died after shooting herself in the head at her Texas home on October 14, investigators said.

Ms Zamora survived in 2007 when a distracted driver plowed into the car she was traveling in with her father Javier Zamora. The Iraq war veteran, 40, died en route to the hospital after suffering massive head wounds during the collision in California.

Seven years after losing her veteran father, Javier Zamora, in a car crash in California, his daughter Maxine (pictured) committed suicide last month after never recovering emotionally from the trauma 

The crash happened after a female driver took her eyes off the road as she tried to pick up her cell phone which had slid under a seat. 

The sedan driver slammed into the Zamoras' SUV in August 2007 as the father and daughter, then 15, returned from a back-to-school shopping trip.

Sgt Zamora, an Army helicopter gunner, had returned to his family only a few months before following a deployment to Iraq.

He was finishing up work commitments and had stayed on with his daughter in California before moving to Texas to join his wife Jennifer, also a military veteran, their two other children and a stepdaughter.

He was buried with full honors at The Los Angeles National Cemetery.

Jennifer Zamora-Jamison lost her husband Javier in a distracted driving crash. Seven years later, her 22-year-old daughter Maxine, who survived the crash, took her own life 

The Army veteran's driving seat was severed, pushing his head into a space between the door and the roof, the Star-Telegram reported. Rescuers had to cut him from barbed wire along the side of the road. 

For years, Maxine told her mother Jennifer that she could not remember the accident until one day her mom found her diary, the pages filled with the pain and grief over what she had seen.

The young mom also had a full back tattoo dedicated to her father completed with an inking of his dog tags. 

The tattoo read: 'My heart still aches in sadness, and secret tears still flow/What it meant to lose you, no one will ever know.' 

Maxine's devastated mother Jennifer Zamora-Jamison told Star-Telegram: 'Maxine struggled through high school and through her marriage and even through her ''mommyhood'' with the loss of not having her daddy there.'

Maxine, who escaped the accident unharmed, moved to Texas where she worked as an exotic dancer in Fort Worth. 

She later married Craig Polizzo and had a baby, Faith Marie, who is now two years old.  

Mrs Zamora-Jamison, who has since remarried, said that her daughter campaigned to stop others suffering from tragedies on the road as she had.

The grieving mother said: '[H]aving to witness people every day on the roadways doing the same thing that took her father’s life. … I think it was too much for her.'

Last month, 22-year-old Maxine, had a fight with her husband at their Fort Worth home, went into another room and put a gun to her head, according to authorities.

She was pronounced dead but her organs were able to be donated for transplant.  

The cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed pending routine toxicology tests. 

According to campaign group, Stopdistractions.org, Texas has not banned texting at the wheel along with Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma. 

Governor Rick Perry threw out a statewide ban on texting while driving, calling it was 'government micromanagement'.

Governor-elect Greg Abbott is also against banning texting while driving .
