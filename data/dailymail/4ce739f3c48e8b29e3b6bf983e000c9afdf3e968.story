Jonny Howson made a triumphant return to Elland Road to nudge Norwich one step closer to the Premier League.

An academy product and Leeds’ youngest captain since Billy Bremner before moving to Carrow Road for £2million in January 2012, Howson marked his first game back at his old club by making the breakthrough in the 57th minute to keep Alex Neil’s side in the automatic promotion places.

The 26-year-old had already endured taunts of ‘cheat’ from the home fans after winning a first-half penalty when he was bundled over by current Leeds skipper Liam Cooper.

Graham Dorrans hammered his spot-kick against the underside of the ball and then wasted another opportunity moments later, although he made amends with Norwich’s second goal in injury-time.

Howson struck when Nathan Redmond poked the ball across to him just inside the box, guiding it with the outside of his right foot beyond a despairing Marco Silvestri and inside the far post.

If his celebration was a little muted, the same could not be said for Neil and his staff on the touchline as they sensed a fifth straight win.

‘I think every passing game now is a massive moment,’ said the Norwich boss. ‘I told the players at half-time that we had three-and-a-half games left. The next 45 minutes could be the turning point of the season to get us over the line or it could cost us.

‘Jonny is a model professional. I know Leeds mean a lot to him but ultimately he’s done his job tonight (Tuesday).’

It still needed a magnificent block by Russell Martin to deny Scott Wootton and John Ruddy’s flying save from Alex Mowatt to preserve Norwich’s lead before Dorrans made sure of victory, burying his shot from 15 yards after a fine run and cutback from Cameron Jerome.

Leeds head coach Neil Redfearn said: ‘The ball was a yard out of play so it’s a bit harsh on us.’

With Norwich, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough all winning, the pressure is now on Watford to do the same when they visit Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. It also raises the stakes even higher when Norwich entertain Middlesbrough at Carrow Road on Friday battling for a £120m ticket to the top-flight.

‘Each game gets bigger and bigger, and for us and Middlesbrough, it won’t get much bigger than this game on Friday night,’ said Neil, who kept his players in the north to prepare for this game after they snatched an injury-time winner at Bolton on Saturday.

‘My mindset before the game is that we do our job, we don’t pay attention to others. With all three of us winning tonight, Watford have got a job to do tomorrow but that’s for them to worry about.

‘We’ve worked so hard to get here. It’s not easy. The games are coming thick and fast, and mentally it’s tough. But we’re well up for the challenge, this is what you’re in football for.

‘Looking at Bolton and Leeds, on paper, they were two extremely difficult games and the fact we’ve managed to pick up six points says a huge amount about the character in the squad.’
