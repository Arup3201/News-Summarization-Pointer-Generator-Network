Louis van Gaal believes Manchester City's poor form gives United a big chance to snatch a win at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

City have won five of their last six league meetings with United but they go into Sunday's game on a bad run of form.

Manuel Pellegrini's team stretched their winless streak to three matches on Wednesday when they were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle.

2013-14 - United 0-3 City, City 4-1 United

2012-13 - United 1-2 City, City 2-3 United 

2011-12 - City 1-0 United, City 2-3 United (FA Cup), United 1-6 City

2010-11 - City 1-0 United (FA Cup), United 2-1 City, City 0-0 United,

2009-10 - City 0-1 United, United 3-1 City (League Cup), City 2-1 United (League Cup), United 4-3 City

And you get the impression Van Gaal thinks City are there for the taking.

'It is not the greatest moment of Manchester City,' he said. "What we have seen of Manchester City in the last matches was not so good.

'We have a good feeling about this match.'

It will be the first time Van Gaal has been in the dugout for an all-Manchester match-up and the Dutchman could field up to five derby debutants for the hotly-contested clash.

But he is sure they will all understand what the fixture means to the club after a pep talk from assistant manager Ryan Giggs this week.

'Ryan Giggs presented the analysis of Manchester City, and I felt more tension (about the derby) with him. It was good to see that,' Van Gaal said.

'He knows it, he has the experience as a player and now maybe as an assistant manager.' 

Rooney joined the rest of his  United team-mates at the launch of the club's sponsorship with Bulova watches and he also wore a Matalan Alphabet scarf  in support of Alder Hey Children's Hospital Charity

Tensions have run high in the build up to the clash but Van Gaal insists his players must not be overcome by emotion on Sunday afternoon.

Wayne Rooney (United) - 11

Joe Hayes (City) - 10

Francis Lee (City) - 10

Bobby Charlton (United) - 9

Colin Bell (City) - 8

Eric Cantona (United) - 8

Brian Kidd (United and City) - 8

Joe Spence (United) - 8

He added: 'We don't have to accelerate this feeling because it is football and you have to play the game, not only a game with emotion but also in a tactical way.

'For me, I have to analyse and prepare for the games in the same manner (as the other matches).'

Wayne Rooney will start Sunday’s Manchester derby but Van Gaal will once again be without Radamel Falcao, who is still injured.

Rooney is back from suspension and fit to captain United against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium after being seen limping at Old Trafford earlier this week. 

Colombia striker Falcao remains sidelined, however, following the knock he picked up in training a week ago.

Van Gaal told a press conference on Friday afternoon: 'Rooney is fine, he was never injured.

'Maybe he was wearing his shoes too tight. He is my captain and he will start the game.

'Falcao is still injured but [Antonio] Valencia is back.'

The United skipper has scored 11 goals against City, the most notable of which came in February 2011 when he put away a spectacular overhead kick to seal a 2-1 win at Old Trafford.

'I have heard that also he has scored a lot of goals against Manchester City, the most of any player,' said Van Gaal, whose claim is accurate.

'I said that to him to stimulate him but he doesn't need that.

'I am very happy that he can play again and he shall play.'

Van Gaal, looking forward to his first Manchester derby, says it will be the biggest local rivalry that he has managed, and recognises what it means to the city.

'This is the biggest derby that I shall manage. It is one of 38 [league] matches we have to play, but for the fans it is unbelievably big as a rivalry and I have felt that also with a lot of the players in the squad, but also especially with Ryan Giggs.

'When he presented the analysis on City, I felt more tension with him. It was good to see.'  

One player who could be key to United's chances is Marouane Fellaini, whose performances over the past two games have seen him back to his best. Van Gaal thinks so too. 

United attempt to regroup at the Etihad during last year's 4-1 defeat by their cross-city rivals

Yaya Toure was on song as United were beaten 3-0 by City towards the end of last season

'He has made a great contribution and also the assist for the [Chelsea] goal.

'He has had a lot of time out injured but when he is fit I have played him. He has to continue with that because then I am very pleased.' 

United lost their two clashes with City by an aggregate score of 7-1 last term; 4-1 at the Etihad and 3-0 at Old Trafford under David Moyes.

Midfielder David Silva will miss Sunday's derby  after being ruled out for around three weeks with a knee injury.

Fellow midfielder Yaya Toure is expected to feature despite being withdrawn during Wednesday's Capital One Cup loss to Newcastle amid concerns about a groin problem.
