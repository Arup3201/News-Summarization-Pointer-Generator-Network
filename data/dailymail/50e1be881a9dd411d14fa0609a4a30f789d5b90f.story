Clutching his father's badge, the heartbroken son of a police sergeant killed in the line of duty pays tribute to his brave hero.

Bensen Johnson, seven, the son of Utah Sergeant Derek Johnson proudly attended his state's annual law enforcement memorial in Salt Lake City yesterday.

His father was one of two Utah officers killed in the last year.

The names of Draper Sgt Derek Johnson and Utah County Sgt Cory Wride were added the Utah Law Enforcement Memorial's Honor Wall on the Capitol's west lawn.

Johnson and Wride's names were added to the Honor Wall along with the names of 137 peace officers killed in the line of duty.

Both
 Wride and Johnson were fatally shot while still in their patrol cars 
after having stopped to help vehicles on the side of the road. Wride was
 killed January 30, while Johnson was killed September 1.

In
 the days following Johnson's death, details of the investigation began 
to unfold. Prosecutors charged Timothy Troy Walker with aggravated 
murder.

Police say he and his former girlfriend, Traci Vaillancourt, were in the vehicle Sgt. Johnson approached when he was shot.

After firing at Johson, investigators believe Walker shot Vaillancourt in the back and then turned the gun on himself.

Since
 he was well enough to appear in court, Walker has been seen multiple 
times with a device that appears to be holding his jaw together.

Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was fatally shot when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo

Fallen: About 10,000 people showed up for the funeral of Sgt Derek Johnson a week after he was killed

Vaillancourt was charged with obstructing justice. But her defense team and her family maintain she is a victim in the case.

In
 December, Sgt Johnson's family donated a tree in his honor to the Utah
 Festival of Trees. It was decorated with police handcuffs, ornaments 
wrapped with the ribbons they wore to his funeral, and challenge coins 
sent in from law enforcement agencies all around the world.

The tree now stands in Draper City Hall.

At Sgt Johnson's funeral, the week after he died, the then six-year-old Benson looked on as nearly 10,000 people gathered in the 
Maverick Center outside of Salt Lake City to honor his father.

Benson and his mother Shante held flags in honor of their 
father and husband (respectively), as six Draper police officers 
escorted the flag-covered casket of Sergeant Derek Johnson to the front of an arena packed with fellow officers, family, friends 
and supporters.

'The streets of Draper City were made
 safer by Sgt Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for 
the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his 
obituary.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept 1, 2013, at the age of 32.'

'He was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen.

'He
 was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, 
Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer
 of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up 
any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend.
 He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and
 giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it read.
