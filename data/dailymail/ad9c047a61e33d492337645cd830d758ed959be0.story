Burnley warmed up for their Premier League return with an 8-0 win over Austrian side FC Grossklein.

Sean Dyche has brought in a few new recruits as the Clarets go down the low-budget route towards top tier survival - and two of them got on the scoresheet as their Austria training camp came to a close.

Marvin Sordell and Lukas Jutkiewicz, signed from Bolton and Middlesborough respectively, both netted twice in the hard-to-handle heat.

Dyche's squad fly back on Monday evening to continue their preparations for the Premier League with games against Accrington Stanley, Preston, Blackpool and Celta Vigo.
