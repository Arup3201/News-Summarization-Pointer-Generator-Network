Wealth: Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in £29.8million

Bosses as Britain's biggest companies saw their taxable pay soar by 15 per cent last year, bringing the average salary of a FTSE 100 chief executive to a staggering £4.72million.

The increase, up from £4.1million in 2012, means it now takes the head of a top company just two days to earn £26,500 - the total amount the average British worker is paid in an entire year.

The news comes as millions of Britons face hardship following years of pay freezes and pitiful rises below the rate of inflation, and further highlights the growing divide between the super-wealthy and those struggling to make ends meet.

Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in £29.8million in just 12 months, according to a study by investor research company Manifest.

His taxable remuneration package, which includes base pay, pensions and long-term bonuses cashed in 2013, was almost three times higher than any other company boss.

In second place was Donald Robert of financial investment firm Experian with £10.1million, while Tidjane Thiam of life insurance and financial services multinational Prudential earned £8.6million.

In fact Sorrell's record-breaking pay was so high that nearly 30 per cent of WPP shareholders refused to back the package at a meeting last year.

The figures are based on the taxable income of FTSE chief executives, not their basic salary, as such a great deal of their remuneration comes in the form of bonuses and reward schemes.

This way of measuring the data in known as Total Remuneration Received.

2. Donald Robert (Experian) - £10.1m

3. Tidjane Thiam (Prudential) - £8.6m

4. Michael Dobson (Schroders) - £8.4m

5. Adam Crozier (ITV PLC) - £8.3m

6. Stuart Gulliver (HSBC) - £8.0m

7. Angela Ahrendts (Burberry) - £7.99m

8. Robert Dudley (BP) - £7.95m

9. António Horta-Osório (Lloyds) - £7.4m

10. Dennis Bristow (Randgold Resouces) - £7.3m

Manifest says the 15 per cent rise in 
executive pay is not surprising, as many receive bonuses in the form of 
company shares linked to stock market performance, which has been strong
 for FTSE companies over the past three years.

When the figures are adjusted to strip out stock market performance related pay and leave only remuneration packages agreed in advance, the numbers are quite different.

This data measure - known as Total Remuneration Awarded - suggests the average pay for a FTSE 100 executive actually fell by seven per cent last year, following a fall of five per cent in 2012.

Despite this the research will make uncomfortable reading for campaigners who have long argued that executive pay is excessive.

'While it is clear that a combination of shareholder action and government regulation has helped to reduce chief executive pay [in terms of Total Remuneration Awarded], the figures in our survey will not end the public debate,' said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest.
