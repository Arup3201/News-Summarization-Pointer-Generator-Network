More than 110 cannabis plants were found growing inside a pub toilet - next a sign warning drinkers they would be barred if they were caught taking drugs.

Police officers discovered the plants, worth more than £5,000, in the womens' toilets of the Laffin Few pub in Tipton, West Midlands, yesterday afternoon.

Incredibly, the class-B haul was found near a sign pinned to a door warning drinkers not to bring drugs into the premises.

Irony: The haul was found near a sign pinned to a door warning drinkers not to bring drugs into the premises

The note - which is written in red on a white background - reads: 'No Drugs! Any one (sic) caught will be banned for life.'

Officers from West Midlands Police seized the drugs, which will now be destroyed, but no arrests were made.

'At around 1.45pm officers located around 110 cannabis plants at the Laffin Few pub in High Street, Tipton,' said a spokesman.

'The plants have now been removed and seized.

'Nobody has been arrested at this stage - officers will be speaking to a man concerning the matter.'

Revealing the cannabis find on their Twitter page, Tipton Green Neighbourhood Policing Team said: 'Shame this establishment didn’t heed it’s (sic) own sign huh..? Licensee to be dealt with..watch this space!'

A picture taken inside the ladies’ toilet shows an officer surrounded by the green plants with the sink barely visible.

It also appears that the drugs are being hidden by boards on a shelf above the toilets.

The pub is currently closed.
