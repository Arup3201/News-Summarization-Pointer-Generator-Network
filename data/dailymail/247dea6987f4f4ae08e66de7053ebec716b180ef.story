TV dinners? The Middletons have bought the right to sell merchandise based on Channel 4's Come Dine With Me

They may enjoy luncheons with the Queen at Windsor Castle. But that hasn’t stopped Carole and Michael Middleton going to the other end of the catering spectrum.

The parents of the Duchess of Cambridge have bought the rights to sell merchandise based on Channel 4’s Come Dine With Me.

They are selling a range of paper plates, place cards and menus based on the programme, in which contestants from different walks of life compete to host the most successful dinner party.

And it seems the Middletons, who are selling the products through their Party Pieces website, have learnt lessons from previously using company logos without permission.

The company, which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table, had a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent after using the ITV talent show’s logo on the site without permission.

On another occasion it fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics. It also rowed with James Bond film producers Eon Productions after using the logo for the latest 007 film Skyfall.

The Come Dine With Me range offers a ‘showdown pack’ priced at £8.99 with menu scrolls and paddles to score each meal.

Other offerings are place cards and badges (£3.99) with such witticisms as ‘lamb lover’ and ‘pesky-tarian’.

The Middletons’ younger daughter Pippa has promoted the products in the online magazine Party Times.

The company says on its website: ‘If you’ve watched Come Dine With Me and thought “I can do better”, team our kits with our stylish tableware and your dinner party will be sure to receive 10s  all round.

‘Bring out this sophisticated party range for special occasions that require the wow factor. We want  you to feel the sense of pulling  out Grandma’s finest gold-plated china for a special party – without the need to worry about chipping the china!’

'Sophisticated' party range: The Come Dine With Me range offers 12 paper plates with garish gold decorations on sale for £4.49

And the ‘sophisticated’ party range? Twelve paper plates with garish gold decorations on sale  for £4.49.

Although accounts for the company are not publicly available, it is clearly a success for the Middletons who put their three children through private school and recently bought a £4.7million country home. However the website, set up by Mrs Middleton in 1987, has previously landed the family in hot water.

Many of their products have left them open to accusations that they are cashing in on the royal association with their daughter and son-in-law Prince William. Only weeks after Kate announced she was expecting her first child, baby products were launched with ‘Little Prince’ and ‘Little Princess’ titles.

The party packs were described as suitable for American-style baby showers, christening parties or first birthday celebrations.

The company previously offered paraphernalia themed around the royal wedding and the Diamond Jubilee. Its street party items included state carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with ‘Long Live G&T’, and flags featuring crown-wearing corgis.

The chain posted a 15 per cent jump in turnover to £94.1million in the year to July 28.

LK Bennett, which was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990 and  now has 51 standalone shops in the UK, said underlying earnings jumped 37 per cent to £11million in the period.

The group last week unveiled Bond girl Rosamund Pike as the face of its spring and summer collection in 2013, saying she was chosen for her ‘English rose charm’.

 The ‘Kate effect’ has helped boost sales at LK Bennett. The duchess is frequently pictured in the fashion brand’s items, particularly its shoes, which have proved a hit with shoppers.
