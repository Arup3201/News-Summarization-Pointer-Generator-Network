Police in Alabama have arrested former NFL fullback Le'Ron McClain on a synthetic marijuana trafficking charge.

Tuscaloosa Police spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley says 29-year-old McClain, currently a free agent, was arrested Wednesday after narcotics agents recovered 122 grams of synthetic marijuana, or spice.

Agents told McClain they'd issue a warrant when tests results on the substance came back later in the day.
