Starbucks is ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding its evening alcohol and light bites to ‘thousands of select stores’ over the next several years.

The chain first offered beer and wine after 4 p.m. at one of its Seattle cafes in 2010. The Starbucks Evenings concept is now available in 26 cafes, with plans to reach 40 by the end of the year.

The cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads. The regular coffee menu is also available during that time.

Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead told the Chicago Tribune that while the concept won’t work in all Starbucks cafes, they’d seen success in some urban areas, near other restaurants and theaters, where people are out at night.

The expansion of Starbucks Evenings is part of the company's push to boost sales after the morning rush hour when people are getting their caffeine fix. There are about 11,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S.

It's a common concept in the restaurant industry - figuring out ways to maximize sales throughout the day since stores have to pay for rent and labor anyway.

Taco Bell, for instance, recently started highlighting snacks in its ads to drive sales during the slower late afternoon hours. And the fruit shakes and other drinks at McDonald's are seen as a way to attract people throughout the day.

As for Starbucks Corp., the chain recently introduced new sandwiches and salads to boost sales in the afternoon. It's also branching out into other areas to as it faces more competition in the coffee market.

The company, which announced a long-term plan to almost double its market value to $100 billion yesterday, also is expanding and improving its rewards program and mobile applications. Earlier this month, Starbucks said it would soon test a way for customers to order items ahead of time with their smartphones.

The company recently purchased a chain of tea shops called Teavana. CEO Howard Schultz has said he wants to make tea as popular in the U.S. as he's helped make coffee.

As part of its effort to sell more tea, the company will begin offering Oprah Winfrey-branded chai tea on April 29 at stores in the U.S. and Canada.

The 60-year-old billionaire appeared on stage at the coffee company's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle on Wednesday along with CEO Howard Schultz to announce the news.

As well as beer and wine, the cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads

They revealed the drink - called the 
Oprah Chai - contains a 'bold infusion' of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, 
cloves, black tea and rooibos and will be available in both latte and 
loose-tea formats.

There was no word on how much the drink will cost but currently Starbucks' signature Chai tea retails from $2.45.

Proceeds from sales of the Oprah Chai will go towards Ms Winfrey's youth education charities.

'I looove tea,' the media mogul said in a press release. 'My daily tea ritual is a vital part of my morning. Savory and spicy chai, with its deep flavor, has long been a favorite of mine.

'When Howard Schultz offered to have me come into the Starbucks tasting room and create my very own tea blend, I thought that sounded like such a unique opportunity and fun to the tenth power.

Cheers to that! Oprah Winfrey is to launch her own eponymous beverage at Starbucks next month

'To share one of my favorite things 
with the rest of the world and support youth education at the same time 
is truly the perfect blend.'

The Oprah Chai will be available in the U.S. and Canada from April 29.

Ms Winfrey personally developed the 
tea with leading teaologist, Naoko Tsunoda, from Teavana. It marks the first time she has lent her name to a brand.

'I think we got it right,' she said.

Starbucks acquired the specialty-tea brand Teavana in 2012 in a move to expand beyond the coffee market and become a multi-product company.

Touching on the collaboration with Ms 
Winfrey he said: 'With the introduction of Teavana Oprah Chai, we are 
going to elevate the tea experience in the same way we did for coffee.

'Partnering with Oprah Winfrey in the creation of this distinctive and remarkable tea is a strong next step forward in accomplishing this objective, while also giving back in a meaningful way through the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation.

'I am personally humbled to work with such an inspirational leader and visionary who shares so many of our core values and beliefs.'

Mr Schultz also told shareholders the coffee company is still in the early stages of growth and has a long-term target of doubling its market cap to $100billion.
