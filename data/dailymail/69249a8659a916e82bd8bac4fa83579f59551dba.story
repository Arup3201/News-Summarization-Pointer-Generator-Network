Robots with an ability to see through walls akin to ‘X-ray vision’ have been developed by researchers.

By transmitting a Wi-Fi signal between them, two robots were able to see what was beyond walls by measuring the change in the signal’s intensity.

The technique could be used to find people trapped in buildings or monitor elderly people at home.

The system was developed by scientists at the University of California led by Dr Yasamin Mostofi.

Two robots on wheels were designed, one that emits a wireless transmission while the other that detects it.

- Search and rescue, and surveillance.

- Occupancy detection in a home.

- Classification of what an object is made of behind a wall.

- Archaeological digs without needing to dig underground.

- Real world robotic networks to perform tasks such as object mapping for humans.

- Detecting home intruders before they enter your house. 

When the robots passed around a square concrete structure, out of sight of one another, they were able to work out what was inside - and could even identify a human.

This was done by measuring the drop in signal strength as the transmission passed through the walls and other objects.

By measuring this drop the robots could create a visual map of what they thought they were seeing in about 100 seconds.

And the researchers say the results were satisfyingly accurate, with errors of no more than two inches (5cm).

 

One robot transmits a Wi-Fi signal and the other receives it. Doing this the robots can work out what objects are between them. Here the left figure shows the area of interest that is completely unknown, while on the right is shown the map the robots made using the technique compared to the actual map

The technique can even be used to discern different types of objects beyond walls including multiple objects (shown), or also to find people beyond walls. This could be used to find people in collapsed buildings or spot intruders before they enter your home

‘Our approach enables seeing a completely-unknown area (with details) through thick walls by using only Wi-Fi signals,’ the team writes on their website.

‘This technology can be implemented on any Wi-Fi-enabled gadget.

‘We have furthermore shown how to use this in a robotic setting to give see-through vision to robots.’

While some modern unmanned robots use laser scanners to see what is in front of them, they are unable to see through objects or walls in the vicinity.

The researchers say that their new technique could be a revolution in robotic movements and enable a host of new capabilities for unmanned robots.

They envisage that the technology could have a host of uses, including search and rescue operations after an earthquake.

They could also examine archaeological sites without needing to dig.
