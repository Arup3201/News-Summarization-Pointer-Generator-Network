Thieves stole a sat-nav from inside an ambulance as it was parked outside a patient's house.

East Midlands Ambulance Service paramedics were responding to a call in New Basford, Nottingham, when someone stole the navigational device between 9pm and 10pm on Friday. 

The vehicle has been forced off the road while a replacement is fitted.

A spokesman for the service appealed to anyone with more information to contact Nottinghamshire Police. 

'The people responsible for the theft of a satellite navigation system from an ambulance parked outside a patient's house should be ashamed of themselves,' said Nick Arnold. 

'Crews clearly need to get to the scene of an emergency as quickly as possible.

'They have road maps to help them navigate but a sat-nav is a much faster system which is why we've installed them into our front-line vehicles.

'Whoever did this is putting lives at risk because we had to take the vehicle off the road to have a replacement unit fitted.'
