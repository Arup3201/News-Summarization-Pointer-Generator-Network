Mitt Romney has jokingly told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate, as President Barack Obama has, because everyone knows that he and his wife are from Michigan.

There were gasps from reporters and laughs and cheers from the crowd of thousands as Romney, in an ill-judged attempt at humour, gave Democrats the opening to portray him as subscribing to the ‘Birther’ conspiracy theory that Obama is not an American.

‘No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate,’ Romney said. ‘They know that this was the place that we were born and raised.’

Joke? Mitt Romney told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate, as President Barack Obama has, because everyone knows that he and his wife are from Michigan

There was an immediate, indignant 
response from the Obama campaign. Ben LaBolt, campaign spokesman, said 
in a statement: ‘Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced 
the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them. 

‘It’s one thing to give the stage in 
Tampa to Donald Trump, Sheriff Arpaio, and Kris Kobach. But Governor 
Romney’s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement 
should give pause to any rational voter across America.’

Romney was telling the crowd in Commerce, Michigan on Friday that he and wife Ann had been born in hospitals nearby.

‘Now I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born. Ann was born in Henry Ford Hospital,’ he said. ‘I was born in Harper Hospital.'

It was then that he said that he had never been asked to show his birth certificate.

The quip was an obvious reference to the theory propounded on the Right-wing fringe that Obama was not born in Hawaii, as a newspaper notice at the time and the long-form birth certificate produced by the White House show, but in Kenya.

For Romney, the subject is a perilous one because many independent voters view such theories as racist and an attempt to de-legitimise America’s first black president.

Romney is more vulnerable on the issue than many other Republicans because he publicly accepted the endorsement of Donald Trump, the billionaire property mogul and reality television star, who is an outspoken proponent of Birther theories.

At the time, Romney said he did not 
agree with Trump on Birtherism. ‘You know, I don't agree with all the 
people who support me and my guess is they don't all agree with 
everything I believe in. But I need to get 50.1 per cent or more and I'm
 appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people.'

Kevin
 Madden, a Romney spokesman, immediately sought to downplay the comment,
 saying that ‘the governor's been clear on this issue many times before’
 and viewed it as settled.

Proof is in the papers: Mr Obama released his birth certificate last April to try and quiet a debate within Republican circles that he was not born in the country

‘The governor has always said, and has repeatedly said, he believes the president was born here in the United States. He was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised.’

LaBolt’s mention of Arpaio and Kobach was an attempt to link Romney to two of the most controversial figures on the Republican right. Arpaio is the Arizona sheriff who calls himself ‘America’s toughest sheriff’ and has gained notoriety for his determination to round up and arrest illegal immigrants.

Arpaio has also called into question Obama’s citizenship and carried out an investigation that concluded his long-form birth certificate was a forgery.

Kobach is the Kansas secretary of state who has filed a lawsuit challenging Obama’s directive that illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children by their parents should be allowed to stay in the country.

The claim that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the US and is therefore not eligible for the presidency sprung up during the 2008 election campaign, when his official birth certificate was released by his aides.

There have been various theories put forward – that he was born in Kenya or that he became an Indonesian as a child or that he was a dual citizen at birth. A number of lawsuits have been brought on the issue, to no avail.

Conclusion: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio 
announced on Tuesday, July 17, 2012, in Phoenix that President Obama's 
birth certificate, as presented by the White House in April 2011, is a 
forgery based on an investigation by the Sheriff's office

In April last year, the White House released Obama’s long-form birth certificate after polls suggested that at least a quarter of Americans were unsure where he was born. During the early stages of the Republican primary campaign, Trump, who said he was weighing candidacy, gained traction in the polls by alleging Obama was not born in the U.S.

Romney advisers said that his joke was unplanned. But many Obama supporters were quick to suggest that it was a dog whistle to racists and an attempt to whip up anger.

Republicans were quick to say that an Obama adviser had suggested Romney was a felon and a super PAC campaign ad linked him to the death of a woman who succumbed to cancer.

At best, Romney’s joke was a tactical blunder because it undermined his promise to run a substantive campaign about big issues and took the focus of the campaign away from what voters care about most – jobs and the economy.

Mitt Romney was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1947 and his wife Ann in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan in 1949. Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961 and Donald Trump in Queens, New York in 1946.
