Daniyal Domine, pictured at Westminster Magistrates Court in Central London, is accused of stalking a Kings College lecturer

An infatuated student at a top university is facing harassment charges after writing love poems to his tutor before taking a ring to her office and trying to propose, a court heard.

Daniyal Domine sent Christine Schallmoser romantic verses in English and German, asked her out for meals and to the theatre and penned an email saying 'you only live once', it was alleged.

He went on to send her at least five 'distressing' emails, paid her at least ten 'unwarranted' visits and went to her office at King's College London with a ring to ask her to marry him, prosecutors said.

Domine, 24 – who was an undergraduate studying German language at King's, where Miss Schallmoser is a German lecturer – is charged with harassing her between March 2013 and October last year.

Details of the case emerged during a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court last month, but for legal reasons the Daily Mail has not been able to disclose them until now.

During the hearing, prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'It started off via email, it has then continued with the defendant entering the complainant's office . . . reaching a point where the defendant has refused to be moved from the locations.'

Domine's alleged harassment began after he missed a class and asked Miss Schallmoser to send him work to catch up. After completing it, he insisted on taking it to her personally, the court heard.

At a previous hearing, Miss Schallmoser said she first came into contact with Domine while she was teaching him German in 2012 to mid-2013.

Initially it was the normal student-teacher relationship but then he started showing an 'inappropriate interest' in her, it was alleged.

Miss Schallmoser said he handed in work in April 2013, along with an email in which he said 'you only live once'. He then sent her a poem and said he hoped it would bring her joy, the court heard.

Domine also asked her to go out for a meal with him, the court heard, and Miss Schallmoser contacted his personal tutor to report his inappropriate activity. He then took a year off from university, but resumed his studies there last September.

He emailed Miss Schallmoser asking her for help getting involved with the student newspaper, the court heard. She put him in contact with the editor and did not hear from him again for some time.

Then, on October 8, she was told by a member of staff that he was waiting at her office, the court heard. The member of staff told Domine he should leave.

But he made further visits to her office and ten phone calls to her on one day alone, Mr Watts said. When police were called, Domine told officers he was there to propose to Miss Schallmoser.

Domine, who was living in a flatshare in London while studying at university, has not yet entered a plea.

He was previously staying in a hospital psychiatric ward but has been allowed to return to stay with his parents – Stephen, 62, a retired company director, and Sara, 48 – at their £900,000 detached, five-bedroom house in Tunbridge Wells.

At Southwark Crown Court yesterday, the Crown Prosecution Service agreed to drop the charge of stalking in favour of the lesser offence of harassment. Domine was released on conditional bail pending his next appearance before magistrates.
