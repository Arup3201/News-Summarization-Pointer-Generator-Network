A vote for independence would create a 'Hadrian's Wall of health' between England and Scotland, the medical director of NHS England warns today.

Writing exclusively in today's Mail, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh warns of the risks to cross-border healthcare - with 44,000 Scottish patients treated in England last year alone.

In a separate warning, Scotland's struggling NHS is facing devastating cutbacks of £450million under the SNP, an explosive secret dossier has revealed.

The confidential paper seen by the Scottish Daily Mail, kept under wraps in the run-up to the referendum, shows that health board chiefs are preparing to make huge savings in 2015 and 2016.

Sir Bruce today destroys Alex Salmond's claims that a No vote could lead to the destruction of Scotland's devolved public health service, pointing out that 'the people of Wales, England or Northern Ireland could not privatise the Scottish NHS even if they wanted to'.

NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens also waded into the referendum debate last night, arguing that a Yes vote means a 'bilateral agreement' may have to be drawn up to allow Scots patients access to specialist health services in England. 

That mean hundreds of patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life-saving heart, lung and liver transplants.

Even though it has been fully devolved to Holyrood since 1999, the future of the NHS has been put at the forefront of the battle for independence by the SNP.

Mr Salmond and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect Scotland's NHS budget – which can be indirectly affected by health spending in England - and the spread of 'privatisation' from south of the Border.

However, any private contractors in England are still paid from the public purse, and the budget for England's NHS is scheduled to increase from £105.6billion in 2013-14 to £110.4billion in 2015-16.

The world-renowned Institute Fiscal Studies last week revealed how the Scottish Government has actually been cutting health services in recent years while there have been funding increases in England.

Now, a document released to the Mail shows how Scotland's NHS chiefs discussed 'significant challenges' and further cutbacks at a meeting on August 6.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown used a speech today to accuse the SNP of 'perpetrating a lie' about protecting the NHS with independence

The SNP are 'perpetrating a lie' about protecting the NHS with independence because Holyrood already has the power to keep the health service in public hands, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said.

Mr Brown said the nationalists should make way for a Labour government in Scotland if they continue to insist they are 'powerless' to protect the NHS without a Yes vote in the independence referendum.

The SNP has argued that the health service north of the border is at risk due to health policies at Westminster, despite the area being devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Speaking at a campaign event in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Mr Brown said: 'The NHS lie of the Scottish National Party has been exposed. The Scottish Parliament can keep the NHS in public hands with its existing powers.

'If the SNP continue to say they are powerless to protect the NHS in Scotland, let them make way for a Labour government in Scotland and we will protect the NHS.'

Mr Brown said the Labour Party would never allow the health service to be privatised in Scotland.

'It is the SNP who are perpetrating a lie about what the NHS can and cannot do in Scotland,' he said.

'Over these next few hours, you must remind the people in Scotland the NHS has the powers and the Scottish Parliament has the powers to fund the health service, to protect the health service, to stop any privatisation, and to keep the health service in public hands.'

It estimates a reduction in day-to-day spending of £210million in 2015-16, rising to £224million in 2016-17, warning that annual savings will need to increase from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent.

'Significant revenue pressures will be realised in 2015-16 and 2016-17, primarily due to the combined effect of a reducing increase in baseline funding, the project impact of the pension revaluation [contribution increases] and loss of national insurance rebate and the cost of funding of the drugs budget – largely due to changes to access to rare and ultra rare drugs, availability of new treatments or extending use to new indications,' it states.

'The total savings required will be £400million-to-£450million in addition to savings required in 2014-15.'

It adds: 'Limited time is available to plan for 2015-16 and 2016-17 and immediate action is required to collectively assess the options that will ensure that NHS Scotland can operate within its overall allocation and that we can continue to provide quality, safe and effective care to our constituent populations.'

Last night, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'These papers show that the SNP have a secret agenda to cut health spending after the referendum. 

'Alex Salmond was elected on a manifesto to protect health spending and now he is planning cuts but has decided not to tell anyone until after Thursday's vote.'

Writing in today's Mail, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh argues against 'trivialising' the challenge facing health services with 'emotional political soundbites'.

And in a new report, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, states: 'The Scottish Parliament has run its own NHS for the past 15 years, with freedom to set its own health spending. That will continue regardless of the result of their independence referendum.

'However, Scottish patients currently make use of a number of specialist health services throughout England, such as heart/lung/and other organ transplants as well as numerous specialist cancer treatments.

'Were Scotland to decide to cede from the United Kingdom, the legal status of Scottish patients wishing to access these services south of the border would change. 

'This would require a new bilateral agreement, or if Scotland were accepted into the EU/European Economic Area then Scottish patients could in theory be treated here on the same basis as, say, a patient from Belgium or Slovakia.'

Responding to the leaked document, a Scottish Government spokesman said: 'We have and will go on protecting and increasing the NHS budget, and our latest £12.1billion resource budget reflects a funding increase in real terms for both 2014-15 and 2015-16.

'More than £1.5billion has been ploughed back into frontline services through efficiency savings in NHS Scotland over the last six years thanks to the three per cent target set by this Government.

'This paper is part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future. Health boards have submitted their plans for how they continue to deliver quality care and treatment within their allocated funding.

'Like all healthcare systems around the world, Scotland's NHS needs to continue evolving.' 

No campaign's fury over secret NHS cuts as Charles Kennedy makes bid to be Union's unlikely saviour

Charles Kennedy and Danny Alexander today hit out at Alex Salmond for suggesting that Scottish independence could save the NHS.

The two Liberal Democrat heavyweights pointed to a secret report warning that Scottish health services face £400million of cuts as proof that the NHS is not safe in the SNP's hands.

Their intervention came as Mr Kennedy, the former party leader, was being promoted as an unlikely last-minute saviour of the Union.

The Lib Dems unveiled a new campaign poster with a huge picture of Mr Kennedy on the side, leading him to say 'they're keeping the best till last'.

Mr Salmond has repeatedly insisted that the NHS in Scotland will be subjected to increasing privatisation if the UK stays together.

But at a campaign event in Glasgow today, Mr Kennedy reminded voters that the NHS, BBC and pound had been created using the resources of the whole of Britain.

'These achievements were built without borders, and to put down artificial borders in the 21st century is absurd,' he said.

'The SNP ran up the flag of fear, saying that if you vote No you would be complicit in bringing about the break-up of the NHS.

'But ministers have been sitting on a report warning of a £400million shortfall in the NHS in Scotland.'

Fightback: Mr Alexander and Mr Kennedy both claimed that the NHS would face huge cuts under the SNP

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, added: 'The big news on the NHS is the £400million of cuts.

'We know that a Yes vote would mean deep cuts to public services, year after year after year.'

The use of Mr Kennedy on the new poster suggests that the ex-leader, who was forced to resign in 2006 after struggling with a drinking problem, is being set up as a 'big beast' who can tackle the charismatic Alex Salmond in the run-up to Thursday's vote.

'Maybe they're keeping the best till last, you never know,' he said today - after pointedly describing himself as a member of the 'Scottish Liberal Democrats'.

Mr Alexander added: 'Charles is one of the most respected political figures here in Scotland.

'It's very important that people hear from Charles Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats.'

Junior minister Jo Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, said: 'Charles is a fantastic asset. He's well-loved - he absolutely the right person to be the Liberal Democrat representative.'
