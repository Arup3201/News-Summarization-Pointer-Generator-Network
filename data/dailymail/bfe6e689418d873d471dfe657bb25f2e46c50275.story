Temperatures hit 23C today on the warmest day of the year so far - but the fine weather will end before the weekend.

Mercury reached the high in St James' Park, London, this afternoon, beating the year's previous record by 1C. But while the capital was basking in the sunshine, remarkably just 40 miles away in Langdon Bay, Kent, it was 13.7C.

Britain was hotter than north Africa, as temperatures reached just 20C in the city of Tunis, Tunisia.

The year's previous high of 22.0C was set in Manston, Kent, on April 14.

Before it starts feeling cold again, many were making the most of the sunshine to visit parks, playground and beaches and catch up with the gardening.

Temperatures could plunge to 13C tomorrow as the weather takes a turn for the worse.

In Cambridge, tourists went punting on the River Cam along the historic Backs as they enjoyed the last few hours of warm.

But the hot, sunny weather is not expected to last, with heavy rain due across the South East tonight.

'Overnight there will be a spell of 
persistent and possibly heavy rain across the South East, so there could
be a wet commute to work tomorrow,' said Charlie Powell, of the Met 
Office.

'Tomorrow it will be showery, with temperatures around 10C lower than they have been in the South East in recent days.

'There will be some sun but temperatures will be around 12C or 13C which is more average for this time of year.'

Busy: These sunseekers, lucky enough not to be working today, made the most of the warm weather before the cold returns in time for the weekend when the rest of us are off

He said temperatures on Friday and Saturday nights could dip sown to single figures with a possibility of frost.

'There will be a mix of sunshine and showers across England and Wales on Saturday and a drier day on Sunday,' he added.

'Next
week will see temperatures continue to be average, or slightly below 
average, so it will be more of a typical Spring week.'

With the weather remaining topsy-turvy, 
the odds of snow falling in any British city in the first May bank 
holiday have been slashed from 10/1 to 2/1.
