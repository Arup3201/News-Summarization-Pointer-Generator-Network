A moped rider was run over and killed after a freak incident in which he came off his vehicle and was thrown into the road.

Police say the 20-year-old was lying on the ground when he was hit by 'definitely one and possibly two' vehicles on the southbound carriageway of the A3 at Hurtmore in Surrey.

Seconds earlier he had come off his machine in mystery circumstances and now police have launched an urgent appeal for witnesses.

The fatality happened on the A3 southbound (pictured) in Surrey between the turnings for the A31 and the B3000

A police spokesman this afternoon told MailOnline that a vehicle stopped at the scene after colliding with the man, just before midnight last night.

But officers believe it is possible a second vehicle may also have collided with the man and have urged the driver to come forward.

One theory is that the motorist may not have realised a collision had taken place, though the circumstances surrounding the death are still being investigated.

The incident happened between the turnings for the A31 and the B3000.

'The moped is believed to have collided with the carriageway and the rider was then struck by another vehicle,' a spokesman said.

'The moped rider, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene around 12.30am today.

'The road was closed in both directions while emergency services, including the air ambulance, dealt with the incident. 

'The northbound carriageway was reopened around 1.15am, while the southbound carriageway was reopened around 5am.'

Sergeant Gary Wright, from the Surrey Police collision investigation unit, said: 'We believe the moped has collided with the carriageway causing the rider to be flung from it and he has then been struck by another vehicle.

'We have spoken to a number of witnesses but would particularly like to speak to anyone travelling southbound on the A3 around the time of the incident who thinks they may have been involved in a collision or has sustained damage to their vehicle which was not there before.

'We would also like to speak to the drivers of any other vehicles who stopped to assist at the scene but did not wait to speak to police, as we believe they may have information which could assist our investigation.'

Police said that they were withholding details of the victim until all his relatives had been told of the tragedy.

A post mortem examination will be carried out on the young man's body and an inquest will be opened and adjourned next week.
