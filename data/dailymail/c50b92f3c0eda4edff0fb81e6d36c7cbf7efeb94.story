Fearing that their free and single ways would cause them to misbehave at her wedding, brothers Dave and Mike were issued with an ultimatum by their cousin - bring a date.

So the men, both in their 20s, took the unusual step of turning to online classified site Craigslist, more commonly used to find things like apartments and furniture, to find a suitable lady to escort to the happy occasion.

Dave and Mike (who don't want to reveal their last name) told MSN Today that their cousin made the order to stop them checking out the single ladies at the wedding.

Plus one: When brothers Dave (left) and Mike were told by their cousin that they had to bring dates to her wedding, they turned to Craigslist to find dates and got nearly 2,000 responses

The ad they posted last week described the siblings as 'dashingly tall, Anglo-Saxon' men who 'love to party, completely house-trained'. And what lady could resist: 'Raw, emotional, sensitive but still bad boys.'

So far Dave and Mike estimate they have received almost 2,000 responses - mostly serious.

They had initially planned to take two sisters they knew, but that fell through when they discovered one of them was in Uganda doing clinical work.

Dave and Mike brainstormed a back-up plan and came up with the unorthodox approach.

In their tongue-in-cheek ad, the brothers encouraged pairs of women to respond, so they will know at least one other person at the wedding. It reads:  'Sisters (twins?!) are preferable, but we'll take friends, or even enemies.

Jill (left), a pretty 22-year-old from New York and Jayne, also 22, attractive and from the Big Apple, are in the frame for the big day

'You should be attractive or our aunts will judge you, but not TOO attractive or one of our uncles might grope you.'

Competition may be fierce because the
brothers have promised a cut of any royalties should the whole wacky 
incident get turned into a romantic comedy by Hollywood execs, something
that they think has an '85 per cent' chance of happening.

But they do have strict instruction for Hollywood bigwigs: 'We refuse to let Ashton Kutcher play either of our characters, however, we will consider him for a supporting role.'

Among
the hopeful are New Yorkers Jill and Jayne, both 22, who described 
themselves as 'genuinely fun and a bit nuts' and sent a PowerPoint 
presentation detailing their qualities.

Another applicant ended her 
response by singing a personalised verse from the Journey tune 'Don’t Stop Believing'. Dave
liked that it rhymed and Mike felt it was creative.

'The timing was on. Mike and I were singing it all night. They’re going to get a call back,' Dave said.

Someone who won’t be making the 
final cut? Penny, a 53-year-old married woman who is taking care of her 
disabled husband and wants to bring her 50-year-old sister.

But her marriage, not her age, is the issue. 'We’re not going to wreck a home,' Mike said.

Watch out for uncle: The boys' criteria are a little tongue-in-cheek but had the desired effect
