With their wings spread and chests puffed out, two birds squared up for a brawl.

This little owl and great spotted woodpecker were spotted engaging in turf war in a Worcestershire nature reserve.

The parental instinct kicked in for both birds as they fought for territory and food and it looked like there was no chance of these two becoming feathered friends.

The tussle was captured by photographer Ian Schofield, 35, who was birdwatching at the Droitwich Spa reserve at the time.

He was part of a photography group who had gone to watch the little owls and their chicks when the woodpecker swept in to challenge for the spot.

'All of a sudden, there was a mighty noise,' he said.

Mr Schofield quickly turned his camera around to find the birds lashing out at each other with their talons.

'In one picture the woodpecker has a bit of fluff in his beak so it looks like it might have had a bite,' he said.

The fight was over in a flash but Mr 
Schofield, who says that photography is his hobby, managed to capture 
these dramatic shots on his Canon 1DX camera.

Both birds are commonly found in England and Wales, while the great spotted woodpecker also lives in Scotland.

They are evenly matched in stature, with the RSPB describing both breeds as between the size of a robin or blackbird.
