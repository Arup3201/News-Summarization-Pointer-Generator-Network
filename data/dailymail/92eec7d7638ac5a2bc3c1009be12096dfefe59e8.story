Inspired by watching Arsenal lift the FA Cup and the simple need to make ends meet, James Ward carved himself a small piece of British tennis history on Friday.

Having arrived a day late in Paris to attend Wembley and see one drought broken, he managed to do something similar – becoming the first British man in 41 years to qualify for the French Open.

The London cabbie’s son scored one of his best career victories – and a minimum payday of £20,000 – by coming back to beat highly-rated former American college champion Blaz Rola 4-6 6-4 12-10 in a shade over three hours.

Fighter: The British number three took inspiration from watching Arsenal win the FA Cup last weekend

Heather Watson could make it a highly unusual British double on Friday if she can overcome Estonian Anett Kontaveit in the women’s final qualifying round to also make it into the main draw of the clay court Grand Slam alongside Andy Murray.

While Ward has to wait and see who he plays Murray was given a middling sort of draw, facing Kazakhstan’s world number 55 Andrey Golubev in the first round with a possible quarter final against Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka.

British number three Ward will probably be gone by then, but yesterday was a reminder of the stirring Davis Cup performances for which he is best known.

An avid Gooner, his three-match run into the main draw had unpromising beginnings when his passion for Arsenal got the better of his professional instincts. He not only got to watch the final but met up with a few of the players afterwards before catching the train to Paris.

'I probably should have been in Paris preparing early but I couldn’t say no to Arsenal', he said. 'To be honest, at 2-0 down after 10 minutes, I was thinking: ‘Everyone who knows I am at this game is going to absolutely slaughter me.’

'My coach probably wasn’t too happy with me but he knows that I am  mad about Arsenal, so he let it go. Even though he’s an Aussie, he realised that we haven’t been in too many finals lately.

Hopeful: Heather Watson could join Ward and Murray in the French open if she wins her final qualifier

1st round A. Golubev (KAZ)2nd round M. Matosevic (AUS) 3rd
 round P. Kohlschreiber (GER) 4th round R. Gasquet (FRA) QF: S. Wawrinka (SWI) SF; 
R. Nadal (SPA) Final N. Djokovic (SER)

'Someone said to me earlier on today: ‘Fight like the Arsenal.’ And I thought: ‘Why not?’ And it worked for me today.'

In emulating John Lloyd from 1973 and wiping out another awkward statistic for British tennis he needed to save two match points at 6-7 in the decider against a player ranked 76 places above him at 94.

Having failed to serve it out at 5-4 in the third Ward showed impressive nerve to hang on, but then the money is a massive incentive for someone in his position.

'It’s very difficult at the 100-250 ranking to make a living really,' he said. ' It’s very difficult because there’s my expenses, my coach’s, food, the hotel, your travel, for the two people and if you lose first round (at Challenger level) you’re getting $300, minus tax, it’s embarrassing, really.

'There shouldn’t be such a massive gap to the guy who can’t even get a transport leaving here, because he’s lost in first round qualies, it’s embarrassing. Even in the past, at the US Open you get refused entry the day after you lose.

'When you’re in the top 200 players in the world and you have to get somebody to pick up your laundry because you left it in there the day before. Those are the sorts of things that need to change.'

Murray seemed reasonably unfazed about his draw, although is aware of the danger Golubev presents.

Tough draw: Murray is aware of the threat posed by Golubev (above), his first round opponent

'He plays exciting tennis, goes for his shots, and when he’s on he makes it very difficult. His form has been inconsistent because of his game style but he beat Wawrinka in the Davis Cup this year, he’s got a big forehand and doesn’t hold back.'

Murray claimed again that he is getting closer to appointing a new coach, although a few of his signs are contradictory on this. 'I wouldn’t expect anything in the next few days but I’m closer than I was in Rome last week. It’s not about rushing.'

It was not all joy for the Brits yesterday, with Jo Konta losing in the final round of women’s qualifying 6-7 7-5 6-0 to Yuliya Beygelzimer and Dan Cox going out of the second round of the men’s event 6-3 7-6 to Paolo Lorenzi.

Murray’s theoretical route: 1st A. Golubev 2nd M. Matosevic (Aus) 3rd P. Kohlschreiber (GER) 4th R. Gasquet (FRA) QF: S. Wawrinka (SWI) SF; R. Nadal (SP) Final N. Djokovic (SER)
