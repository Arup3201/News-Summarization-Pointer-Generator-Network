Four doctors at Colchester General Hospital are on 'special leave' after police raided a house in an online child sex offence investigation.

Officers from Essex Policeâ€™s online investigation team, which deals with online child sex offences, raided an undisclosed address in Colchester earlier this month.

No arrests have been made. Criminal investigations are continuing.

Colchester General Hospital: Four doctors have been placed on 'special leave' after police raided a house earlier this month in an online child sex offence investigation

The four doctors - whose names, ages, 
sex and roles, have not been released - were told to leave the hospital 
when bosses found out.

A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Essex Police made us aware of an investigation into an alleged activity that had occurred outside of this organisation.

'Consequently, on the same day, the trust put four employees on special leave while police inquiries continue, which remains the position.'

He said the General Medical Council, which registers doctors to practise in the UK, has been made aware. He declined to comment further.

An Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'No arrests have been made at this time and inquiries are continuing.'

She refused to give any more details regarding the case.

The police online investigation team was created more than five years ago to deal with the increase in online child sex offences.

It deals with all offences involving indecent images of children committed online, offences of inciting children to engage in sexual activity online and grooming committed online.
