His beloved X Factor format has suffered a ratings slide, despite bringing in new judges and tweaking the format.

But things are looking up for Simon Cowell as finalists from the show are dominating the iTunes chart for the first time ever.

Being the first year tracks from the talent show have been legible to chart, finalists Alex & Sierra have stormed to the top of the charts - alongside fellow finalist Jeff Gutt.

Making Simon happy! X Factor contestants Alex & Sierra have reached number one on iTunes

The couple and singing duo have already seen their track Say Something beat Christina Aguilera.

Now, their cover of Sara Bareilles' hit Gravity has reached number one on the pop charts.

Thrilled to hear of the news, judge Simon took to Twitter to reveal his glee at the news - while singer Sara tweeted: 'Alex & Sierra SLAAAYEED Gravity on The X Factor. Wow. Wow. Beautiful.'

'Alex and Sierra are number 1 again on iTunes! Thanks to everyone who has bought it.' he tweeted.

The
 real-life couple, who brought judges Demi Lovato and Kelly Rowland to 
tears with their performance, currently have FIVE tracks in the Top 50 
on iTunes and eight tracks in the Top 125.

Last
 week, their rendition of "Say Something" surpassed Christina Aguilera 
and A Great Big World's current radio hit by creeping up to No. 1 - and 
is now at No 2.

Good news: Simon took to Twitter on Thursday to spread the word about Alex & Sierra

Something to smile about: Simon Cowell will be pleased that his acts can now chart in the US for the first time whilst still performing on The X Factor

While other acts from the doing well are Jeff Gutt with Hallelujah reaching number four on the charts - hot on the heels of Alex and Sierra - and his other track Demons reaching 45.

Whilst Restless Road saw their track Wanted reach number 65.

Making mention of the chart success on last night's Fox show, Cowell said afterwards: 'It's incredible.

'I've
 always said this about these shows - it's not about winning a silly 
trophy, it's about launching an artist. It's about a career outside of 
it and that's what I'm most proud of. It does launch proper artists.

'We
 have to trust our A&R abilities, that this show can find better 
artists that anyone else. That's the future of the show.'

And he mused: 'You always have a moment ... 
[with] certain contestants. I can remember having it with One Direction 
and Leona Lewis. There's one song where you go, 'I can 
see this working'.'

Demi agrees that the couple could be the last ones standing, saying: 'I think Alex 
& Sierra are going to take it. They are so talented, 
it's insane. Even if they don't win, they are going to succeed.'

Stars of the show: Alex & Sierra have already beaten the likes of Christina Aguilera in the charts

And while you may be hard pressed to remember the winners' names from the last two seasons, the talent show has provided a launch board for acts including season 2's Emblem 3 and Fifth Harmony, with the latter set to open for judge Demi on her next tour.

Nothing compares, however, to the success of X Factor UK boyband One Direction - who have sold 32 million records worldwide and are the pop sensation of the decade.

While Leona Lewis has sold 30 million records to date since winning the X Factor UK in 2006 and other acts including Little Mix and Cher Lloyd have been hits worldwide.

With the future of the X Factor as yet unclear, Entertainment Weekly recently mused it may not be out of the realms of possibility for Fox to order a fourth season for 2014 - revealing the series would come back for a reduced number of episodes.

The magazine said: 'We’re hearing Factor‘s fate is not yet sealed. In fact, sources say Fox and Factor producers have started renewal discussions on a potential fourth season,' adding:  'To network executives and advertisers, new shows are scary mystery boxes, while Factor is, for better or worse, a known quantity. Canceling X Factor means filling three additional hours next fall with scary mystery boxes.'

Local versions of The X Factor are produced in more than 45 territories and the US version of The X Factor USA airs in over 205 countries.

While artists discovered by The X Factor format have sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including 130 No 1’s, and 350 Top 10 records. 

Fox executives are set to make a decision on a pick-up for a fourth season by next month.
