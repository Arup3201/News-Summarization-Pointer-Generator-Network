Security Guard David Glass has been jailed for 15 months for stealing £49,600 from armoured Loomis trucks

A security guard funded a lavish lifestyle with almost £50,000 stolen from 50 cash machines he was supposed to be refilling.

Former soldier David Glass, 33, took the cash from the armoured trucks he drove to supply bank cash points while working for security company Loomis.

Hull Crown Court heard that Glass
had taken £49,600 in cash while delivering notes to ATM machines 
between October and December last year, and that he had been the driver for note 
delivery of 50 ATM deliveries where money had gone missing.

But he was not suspected until he 
resigned on December 15 after being questioned over a missing
£1,180 taken from a delivery of cash for Hollywood Bowl, in Kingswood, 
Hull.

When police raided his home they found new iPads, iPhones, blue-ray player £3,279 in cash and invoices for the purchase of a car and jewellery.

Crown barrister Nigel Clive said Glass was the driver of a van taking £23,000 to the Hollywood Bowl on November 10 last year.

But because of technical glitch the alley could not accept the money, it was said, and it was trusted to Mr Glass to return the money to the parent company.

However, when it was counted again there was £1,180 missing.

Mr Clive said Glass’ resignation triggered an internal investigation at Loomis, and Glass was linked to missing cash from 50 ATM deliveries - all of which he was the driver.

'When police went to his home they found £3,279 in cash, large amounts of high-value goods including: iPods, iPads, a blue-ray player and invoices for purchases of a car and jewellery,' said Mr Clive.

'It was apparent all the money had been spent on his family’s lavish lifestyle.

But he was not suspected until he resigned on December 15 after being questioned over a missing £1,180 taken from a delivery of cash for Hollywood Bowl, in Kingswood, Hull

'Money had initially been paid into his wife’s account and that of his sister-in-law’s account and returned to him after a short period of time. The aim was to give a provenance of income from other family members.'

Glass of Patrington, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft. His wife Verity Glass, 30, pleaded guilty to possession of £14,000 in criminal property.

Mr Glass’s sister-in-law Bethany Sizer, 22, of Burstwick, pleaded guilty to transferring £5,500 in criminal property.

Defending all three, barrister Harold Bloomfield said Mrs Sizer had played the lesser role.

'She accepts she behaved naively,' said Mr Bloomfield.

'It was a single transaction. She was with her sister when the money was paid into the bank. She accepts her wrong doing. She was not aware her brother-in-law was stealing to such a large extent.

'She is pregnant and due to give birth on September 3. I urge you to follow the pre-sentence report.'

Judge Simon Jack told Sizer he accepts she was on the edge of the theft and she would have a criminal record and gave her a 12-month conditional discharge.

Mr Bloomfield told the court: 'Mr Glass is entitled to maximum credit. He resigned from Loomis, bringing to an end, two-months of dishonesty. It was only after he left, that enquiries took place. He accepts the heat would have been on him.

'He was in the Royal Logistics Corp serving in Kosovo in 1986 where he witnessed unfortunate events. This has made his personality more fragile. After leaving the Army where he had a position of responsibility he found it difficult to cope with the loss of status. It did not stand him in good stead for Civvie Street. He was having problems at home at the time. He recognised from day one custody was inevitable.'

He said Mrs Glass was swept along with money coming into the house and because of her relationship difficulties did not feel able to question where it was coming from.

Sentencing Judge Simon Jack told Glass: 'You have served your country in the past and had unfortunate experiences in the Army. That does not excuse what you did at Loomis. This was theft on a substantial scale. A total of £50,000 was taken in 10 weeks. This is large-scale theft. The money seems to have gone on extravagant spending. There was no reason for you to take that money. There has to be a custodial sentence. The public would expect no less for the level of theft you have committed.'

He jailed Glass for 15 months and imposed a 12-month community order on his wife who left the court in tears.

They will both face an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover any money they have left. There will be a POCA hearing in October.
