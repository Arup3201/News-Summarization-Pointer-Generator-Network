Newcastle are reviving interest in signing Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United.

The former Crystal Palace winger had hoped to be a part of Louis van Gaal's plans at Old Trafford, but Alan Pardew believes that he may be available this summer.

Pardew had expressed an interest in taking Zaha on loan last January, but the young Englishman moved to Cardiff City instead.

Zaha endured an immensely disappointing first season at Old Trafford under David Moyes, where the England under-21 international failed to start a single match in the Barclays Premier League before going out on loan.

Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson’s final signing as Manchester United manager, joining the club in a £15million deal and on a five-and-a-half year contract.

The player himself would rather stay in Manchester, with van Gaal's reputation for developing young talent a major attraction, but is understood to want at least some first team football.
