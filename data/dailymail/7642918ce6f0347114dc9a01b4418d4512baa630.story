Whoever said you can't teach an old dog new tricks had clearly never watched these performing pooches in action.

For the fourth year running, daring dogs have descended on Huntington Beach in California to take part in a bizarre surfing competition.

And while some of the four-legged contestants needed some encouragement to take to the waves, to others it seemed to be second nature.

Surf's up: Hanzo, a four-year-old German boxer, catches a wave during the annual Surf City Surf Dog competition at Huntington Beach in California

Making a splash: Hanzo, who learned to balance on a board when he was only 10 weeks old, was one of 48 competitors who took part in the surfing contest

Perfect: Dogs were awarded five points by the judges if they managed to ride a wave on all fours

Is this a good idea? Another dog, called Sir Hollywood, looks a little unsure as he takes part in the competition at Huntington Beach, California

The Surf City Surf Dog competition, watched by 1,500 spectators, was the highlight of a three-day festival of events promising 'doggone fun for all'.

Forty-eight dogs of all sizes took part in the contest, all seeking to impress a panel of judges with their ability on a surfboard.

Competitors - called 'surFURS' - got two points for lying on the board, three for sitting and five for standing on all fours.

Extra points were awarded to dogs who pulled off a manoeuvre, such as a 180-degree or 360-degree spin or riding backwards.

Thrills and spills: A dog, carrying a camera to film the action, loses control and falls into the water

Soaked: A very wet dog is held by its master during the competition, which was watched by 1,500 spectators

And five points were on offer to the dog which completed the longest ride and negotiated the biggest wave.

The
entrants competed in four different weight categories, ranging from the
extra-large section for dogs weighing 60lbs and above to the small-dog 
level for pooches under 20lbs.

They had to adhere to strict rules, the most important being that every dog had to wear a life jacket.

The festival also included a world record attempt, in which 20 dogs tried to surf a wave for five seconds simultaneously.
