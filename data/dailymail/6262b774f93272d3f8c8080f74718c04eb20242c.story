Headline acts performing at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games will sing over pre-recorded backing tracks.

Organisers have defended the move, claiming the British weather and the shape of the Olympic stadium mean it's 'not possible for the music in all the shows to be live'.

But it is likely to infuriate fans who have paid up to Â£2,000 to watch a star-studded line-up rumoured to include The Rolling Stones, Coldplay, The Who and Adele.

Who are you?: Veteran rockers The Who are rumoured to be on the top secret line-up

The line-ups for the opening ceremony on July 27 and the Olympics' farewell on August 12 are a closely guarded secret.

But they are expected to feature a who's who of British music.

Organisers have dubbed the shows a celebration of the best Britain has to offer, 'from Elgar to Adele.'

And there are expected to be starring roles for rock veterans The Rolling Stones and The Who, as well as Coldplay.

In February, creative director Kim Gavin insisted there would be an emphasis on live performance. He said: 'The intention isn't to go out there and do a mime show.'

But organisers have been forced to concede all backing music will have to be laid down in the studio beforehand.

Plans for an all-live show were hampered by concerns about the unpredictability of the British weather, as well as technical issues with the shape and size of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.

Organisers want to create a surround sound effect, but the bowl shape of the venue meant they were left with microphone feedback during sound tests.

A spokesman for organisers Locog 
insisted: 'Due to the complexity involved, it's just not possible for 
the music in all the shows to be live. There will be live musical 
elements, but many of the shows will be recorded in advance. This is 
standard procedure for an event of this scale.'

Despite this, the decision to use backing tracks has been dubbed 'shameful' by Horace Trubridge, the assistant general secretary of the Musicians Union.

Mr Trubridge told the Times: 'Coming from the UK, which is the home of live music, it is very poor'.
