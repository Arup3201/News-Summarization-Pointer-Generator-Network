The San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat will meet again in the NBA Finals, just a year after battling over seven games in one of the most thrilling Finals in years.

Miami took that one 4-3 to win their second successive Larry O'Brien trophy, but this year the Spurs enter as slight favourites.

This is the series everyone was hoping for. The two best teams in the league by a distance go at it again in a replay of last year’s epic Finals. Though the teams are largely the same there have been subtle changes that could end up being the deciding factors in this paper-thin contest.

This series will be decided by the finest of margins.

Each team’s ‘Big 3’ - San Antonio’s Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili and Miami’s LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh - will ultimately decide the series. All six of these players are going to the Hall of Fame one day, while James and Duncan are two of the top 10 (maybe even top five) players of all-time.

Fully fit: Dwyane Wade is a lot healthier than he was in last year's finals

For Miami, James remains the best player in the League by some distance, perhaps even the most dominant athlete in any sport. Wade, unlike last year, is back to full fitness and making a huge contribution, while Bosh has recovered from early struggles to find his shooting.

Tim Duncan might be 38 but he’s performing better than those 10 years younger. Manu Ginobili ripped the Oklahoma City Thunder apart with his shooting and vision in the Conference Finals, but there is a question mark over Tony Parker’s hamstring. He’ll need to be fully fit for the Spurs to be firing.

But if we assume that those six will be at their best then the spark will have to come from somewhere else. This is where Miami held the advantage last year, but that has swung in favour of the Spurs this time round.

Shot's off: Ray Allen is not shooting as well as he did in 2013

The Heat’s reserves, so crucial in their championship win last time, are performing slightly worse than they did, while the Spurs can rely on an improved bench.

Ray Allen can still be relied on to make the big shots but he is a non-factor on defence and his shot isn’t finding the mark as often as it did in 2013. Chris Andersen is a huge help off the bench, but he is carrying a niggling thigh injury. Shane Battier has completely lost his shot, and while Rashard Lewis has taken his place to good effect, the Heat miss the shooting of Mike Miller, who departed at the start of the season.

Miami’s starters have been logging huge minutes in this year’s play-offs, so the Spurs should look to strike when they are getting their rest.

Star in the making: Kawhi Leonard can guard LeBron as well as any player in the NBA

The Spurs’ role players are the best in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard is a star in the making and will do as good a job as anybody in the league in defending LeBron. Danny Green set a Finals record last year with his three-point shooting, while the Spurs can also rely on Boris Diaw, Marco Belinelli and Patty Mills to provide scoring from the bench.

The other crucial factor is San Antonio has home court advantage this year, not the Heat. Playing in front of your home crowd in a potential championship decider will make a huge amount of difference.

Just like last year this will be one of the best NBA Finals ever and it is almost impossible to separate two extremely evenly matched teams. I think the Spurs will edge it in seven, just because in a series this tight having home court advantage will be huge.

But I won’t be going anywhere near a bookies for this one.

Role players: The likes of Boris Diaw will have to have an impact off the bench for the Spurs to win

It’s as simple as this: San Antonio should have won last year. The Spurs are better than last season. The Heat are not as good as they were.

The way San Antonio have bounced back from their heartbreaking NBA Finals defeat has been nothing short of brilliant. It looked for all money like Tim Duncan had missed his chance for an elusive fifth crown, but his Spurs charge are back, better than ever.

All this excellent season for the Spurs needs now is another championship banner hanging at the AT&T Center.

Niggle: Tony Parker has been suffering with a slight hamstring injury

The major difference has been the excellent bench led by Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli, who has looked so comfortable in a San Antonio jersey since his switch from Chicago.

The Heat are not quite the force they were last year. Of course, they’re still one of the very best in the league and have the No 1 player in the game in LeBron James.

If motivation is the issue, then there won’t be a problem. Miami will raise their game for the occasion with the incentive a third title in a row. James will also up things a notch and, with Kevin Durant’s season over, look to prove that he is the best.

Key man: Manu Ginobili is much fitter than he was last year and was brilliant against the Oklahoma City Thunder

But, when LeBron is in a lull and the rotations are in full swing, I expect the Spurs’ depth to be too much for the Heat.

The teams will share the opening two games, and the Spurs will also snatch a road victory in Miami, leaving the series tied 2-2. After winning game five at home, San Antonio will find themselves in exactly the same position as last season, 3-2 up on the road.

This time, there will be no missed rebound, no magic Ray Allen three-pointer to force overtime, and no Heat getting out of jail. San Antonio will show why they had such an excellent road record during the regular-season.

Spurs to win in six, and dethrone the back-to-back champions on their home court.

Big impact: Chris Bosh re-found his scoring touch against the Indiana Pacers

A chance for revenge versus the opportunity to make more history. That’s what is at stake in this year’s NBA Finals as the San Antonio Spurs take on the Miami Heat.

In a repeat of last year’s series showpiece, which Miami won 4-3, expect another equally close and pulsating best-of-seven encounter but this time with a different outcome.

The way San Antonio bounced back from their agonising loss to Miami last season has been mightily impressive.

Mastermind: Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has created the most beautiful offence in the NBA

The best team in the NBA – this has been proven with their No 1 seed in the Western Conference play-offs following a regular season record of 62-20.

In coach Gregg Popovich, they have someone who knows how to win having guided this franchise to five previous NBA Finals appearances.

What has been most striking about the Spurs is their ability to score from the bench. In their Western Conference Finals Game 6 clincher at the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Spurs’ replacements scored 51 points in comparison to Oklahoma's five – with the 46-point differential in bench scoring the largest in any game this season.

Enforcer: Chris Andersen is a key big man for the Heat but he is struggling with a thigh problem

This reason alone is why the Spurs should be the favourites for the series. For Heat coach Erik Spoelstra he is not only looking at trying to contain the all-star starting talents of Tony Parker and Tim Duncan; but also the threats of Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli who can score three-pointers for fun.

Undoubtedly Miami’s 'Big 3' of Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James will play a huge factor in this series but they themselves cannot solely win it for the Heat on their own. 

Four-time MVP James would dearly love to make the 2014 NBA Finals the year of the “three-peat” and again has been his team’s focal point as they progressed through the Eastern Conference play-offs.

Maligned: Heat coach Erik Spoelstra still has critics despite taking the Heat to the finals in four straight years

Home court advantage is also likely to play a factor with San Antonio having won all four of their previous NBA Finals when they’ve held this privilege. However, over the last four years the Heat have played in 15 play-off series and recorded  road wins every time.

Expect both sides to secure away triumphs but the Spurs to edge it in seven in front of their own fans at the AT&T Center for a sweet vengeance.
