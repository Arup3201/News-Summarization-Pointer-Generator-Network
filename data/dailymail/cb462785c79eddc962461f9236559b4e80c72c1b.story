Ever since the Duchess of Cambridge and model Cara Delevingne began sporting bolder, bushier eye brows, they have been a must for any fashion conscious female.

But for some women cultivating a trendy and natural-looking ‘power brow’ was impossible after years of over-plucking.

Now experts have finally come up with a solution – eyebrows in a bottle.

Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer is a revolutionary new powder which has hundreds of tiny fibres mimicking real hair

Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer is revolutionary new powder, containing hundreds of tiny fibres which mimic real hair, that can simply be brushed onto existing brows or the forehead in seconds.

The synthetic fibres, which are made from nylon and come in four shades, cling to existing hair or skin, thickening up sparse patches, lengthening brows and giving a much more natural, shapely look than one achieved with an eyebrow pencil or pen.

It can even create brows if no hair exists at all, which means the powder can help restore the looks and confidence to cancer sufferers who’ve lost their eyebrows through chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

The fibres are suspended in an ultra-fine powder, which is water-proof and derived from minerals found in sea clay. It sets within 60 seconds and can be washed off and applied daily like ordinary make-up.

It's already a best seller in Australia and costs £19.99 for a 4g bottle - includes around 120 applciations

Costing £19.99 for a 4g bottle, which includes around 120 applications, Fibre Brow Enhancer is already a best-seller in Australia, where it was launched last year.

It is due to go on sale on the British High Street at Boots later this month (Oct).

Sam Franklin, 28, from Brighton, Sussex, lost her eyebrows and hair after undergoing treatment for cervical cancer.

‘After I lost my hair and brows I really didn’t feel like myself anymore, in fact how I looked made me feel quite depressed,’ she said.

‘While I can wear a wig to disguise hair loss, I struggled to find a product that would give me brows. Every product I tried didn’t look realistic and didn’t stay very long on my skin.

Model Cara Delevingne sports bolder, bushier eye brows and has inspired a generation of women to go bigger

‘I tried the Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer and I haven’t looked back. It is waterproof, lasts at least 12 hours and the tiny fibres look so realistic, it’s completely changed the way I feel about myself while I’m undergoing treatment.’

The trend for thicker, bushier brows, dubbed the ‘Scouse Brow,’ was sparked by the stars of Liverpool-based E4 reality TV show Desperate Scousewives, and Merseyside WAGS Alex Curran and Coleen Rooney.

It further increased in popularity when the Duchess of Cambridge cultivated thicker, bolder brows and many celebrities, including fashion model Cara Delevingne and actresses Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly, have also ditched thinner brows in favour of a bushier look.
