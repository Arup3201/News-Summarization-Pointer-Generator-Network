Former Fox News television host Glenn Beck has revealed that he has regrets about his time on the network, saying that he could have had a more positive impact on the country if he took a different tone.

During a taped interview for Megyn Kelly's primetime Fox News show on Tuesday night, the radio host and media personality reflected on his eponymous show that aired on the network until he left for other projects in 2011.

'I remember it as an awful lot of fun and that I made an awful lot of mistakes, and I wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language because I think I played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart,' he said.

Looking back: Glenn Beck stopped hosting his eponymous show on Fox News in 2011 but said that he now feels partly responsible for the country's political problems

'I didn’t realize how really fragile the people were. I thought we were kind of more in it together.

'And now I look back and I realize if we could've talked about the uniting principles a little more instead of just the problems, I think I would look back on it a little more fondly.'

The unusually reserved pundit- who made a name for himself in the cable programming world for his outlandish skits and willingness to sing, dance, or provoke to make a point- was visibly reflective and almost emotional.

Megyn Kelly entered the interview with a big smile, laughing and reflecting on the good times and his funny antics on set.

Different dispositions: Megyn Kelly praised Beck, which made him visibly uncomfortable, with her saying 'what a phenom you became while you were here at Fox and now you're King of the Airwaves'

Antics: Beck's on-air skits made his show a hit (seen during two different shows in 2009)

One that was highlighted was a show where he challenged then-white House communications director Anita Dunn to call him on a red phone on his set in order to correct him on a story where he played a clip that appeared to have her praising Mao Tse Tung.

He held a dead fish on air to make a point about a 'stinky' policy and wore lederhosen as he compared Americorps to Nazi brownshirts.

As soon as the brief interview turned over to Beck, however, his tone was visibly more sombre, looking like the clips made him disappointed with the highlighted behavior.

Beck’s show left the Fox News Channel in 2011 but he continued to espouse his love of the Constitution and his feelings on conservative politics through his own subscription-based cable network, Blaze TV, and matching radio show.
