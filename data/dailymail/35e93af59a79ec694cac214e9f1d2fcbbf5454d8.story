Snap unhappy: Eric Stonestreet refused to have his picture taken with Republican Rick Santorum

Modern Family star Eric Stonestreet revealed that he refused to have his picture taken with Rick Santorum because of the Republican’s views on gay marriage.

Stonestreet, who plays gay character Cam on the hit sitcom, said that the politician wanted to pose with him at a White House Correspondents Dinner.

However, Stonestreet, who is heterosexual, said that he refused.

He told Huff Post Live: ‘Rick Santorum wanted a picture with me. It was at a time when he was publicly saying, “Gay marriage, gay marriage [is wrong],” and I'm like, “You know, I can't do it.” It was with him and his kids or something like that, and I said, “I'd be happy to take a picture with the kids, but I can't just be in a picture with [Santorum].”’

He added in the interview that he had read about President Barack Obama and his family being fans of the show.

He said: ‘To hear the leader of the free world, the president of the United States, say that and to know we have that sort of reach with people and that the people in power and leadership are watching the show [is incredible].’

Mr Santorum has received criticism in the past for suggesting that same-sex marriage could harm children.

He said: ‘Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships.

'In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.'

Earlier Mr Stonestreet predicts that one day, it's not going to take an act of courage for an openly gay person to play in the NFL.

‘It's going to be considered common. It's not going to feel taboo, and people are not going to feel they need to be closeted or keep their sexuality a secret because of other people's opinions,’ Stonestreet told The Associated Press.
