Two-thirds of councils are subjecting vulnerable pensioners to the indignity of 15-minute care visits that are too short to meet their needs, an independent report has found.

Hundreds of thousands of frail, elderly people are being hit by the growing culture of so-called ‘clock-watch care’, the research revealed.

And it exposes how care workers are undertrained, with almost half going into homes with no training in how to look after dementia or stroke patients.

The report comes after charities and trade unions last year demanded an end to clock-watch care, an issue which the Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted through its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

This latest study by Labour peer Baroness Kingsmill was commissioned by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who yesterday pledged to ban care visits lasting just a quarter of an hour if he wins the General Election.

Baroness Kingsmill concluded that England faces a ‘crisis’ in the quality of care for older and disabled people who need help preparing meals, bathing and taking medication.

‘People who may be vulnerable are not being treated with the care and attention they deserve,’ she said.

‘Strict restrictions on time mean that people are not being treated with dignity, their needs are being ignored and care workers cannot do a satisfactory job.’

Care agencies are ‘exploiting’ home helps, the report said, with up to 220,000 workers in effect being paid less than the minimum wage because the firms pay them only for the visits and not the amount of time taken to travel between them.

And many workers who stayed longer than the 15-minute slots they were allocated – so they could attend to their patient with the dignity they deserve – were not paid any extra.

The report said: ‘Care workers are undervalued, underpaid and undertrained … The sector is subject to weak regulation. The working conditions of care workers are among the worst of any in England.

Qualifications are patchy. The workforce tends to be older women or migrant workers, who have few other employment options.

‘The low status of care work and poor treatment of workers has led to a vicious downward spiral into one of the most  difficult sectors for workers,  with widespread exploitation.’

Mr Miliband said that, as prime minister, he would work with councils and care agencies to raise standards in the industry, adding: ‘I am determined that a Labour government will call time on clock-watch care.’

The Labour leader commissioned Baroness Kingsmill, a former solicitor, to write a report into the impact of exploitative employment practices on the care of elderly and vulnerable people.

It found that between 150,000 and 220,000 of England’s 1.8million care workers were paid less than the minimum wage, often because they are not paid for time spent travelling between visits.

And 41 per cent do not receive training to help deal with specific medical needs, such as dementia and stroke, while nearly a third receive no regular training.

The report said 15-minute care should end and called for a new Care Charter to be drawn up by regulators. It also said there should be an inspection regime for the commissioning of care.
