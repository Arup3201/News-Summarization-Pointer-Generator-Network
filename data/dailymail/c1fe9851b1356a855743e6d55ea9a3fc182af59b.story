Auctioneers were stunned last week when a rundown house sitting on a deceased estate in Sydney's eastern suburbs was bought for a whopping $4.31 million.

36 Knox Street, Clovelly, sold for $610,000 above it's reserve, even though the house requires nearly $100,000 worth of renovations.

The retro brick house is positioned on a substantial elevated block of land with sweeping views of the eastern beaches and the rolling hills of Clovelly. 

Auctioneers were stunned last week when a rundown house sitting on a deceased estate in Sydney's eastern suburbs was bought for a whopping $4.31 million

Bidding started on the day at $3.4 million and quickly increased in increments of $100,000. 

At one stage it looked likely that the house could be taken off the market for $3.9 million, but a last minute buyer secured the hot property for $4.31 million.

The five-bedroom home faces north east and locals have apparently been waiting for it to come on the market for years, due to the amazing views.

At one stage it looked likely that the house could be taken off the market for $3.9 million, but a last minute buyer secured the hot property for $4.1 million

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the buyer was a local man who drove past the house every day and had been waiting for his chance to get his hands on the property. 

Selling agent Martin Farah told the newspaper that the massive 720-square metre block, which is at the highest point in the suburb, attracted the buyer due to the vast amount of land available. 

'He wanted his family to have a big block of land so they are planning to move in and do the big renovation down the track,' Mr Farah said.

It is unlikely that the buyer will be packing his bags and moving in just yet, as $100,000 already needs to be spent on a new kitchen, carpets and on the renovation of both of the houses two bathrooms

The ever-present sea breeze is freely available in the L-shaped living room, which opens up out onto a spacious balcony, overlooking Clovelly bay. 

According to the house's advertisement on Domain, the land was extremely underutilised by the former owner.
