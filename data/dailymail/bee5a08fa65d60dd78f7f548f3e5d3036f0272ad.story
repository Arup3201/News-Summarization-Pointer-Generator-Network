From her coveted seat on the sidelines of this week’s hottest catwalk show, businesswoman Teodora Mihaylova surveys the models with a discerning eye.

As the co-owner of two children’s hair and nail parlours, she takes fashion very seriously. The cut of a jacket, the hue of a shoe, the just-so accessories, nothing escapes her notice.

In the spirit of a true fashionista, practicality is not an issue for her. It’s all about the label — and most importantly — being seen in that label.

Strutting their stuff: On the catwalk at Global Kids Fashion Week

But Teodora, from West London, is not looking for clothes for herself. She is researching looks for her children Sienna, who’s just 18 months old and Alex, who’s four.

‘My kids are my trophies. I love to see them well-groomed and well-dressed,’ she announces proudly.

She confesses to spending around £3,000 a year — more than she spends on herself — kitting them out. She once spent £250 on a pair of kids’ designer shoes, only to see them wrecked the first time her son wore them.

‘Of course, they don’t know anything different,’ she says. ‘They do grow out of them so quickly — and the clothes don’t last long — so for me, it is more about the logo than the quality. Some people may not even realise if my kids have a Ralph Lauren jumper on. But it’s the kind of thing I notice.’

It’s this thinking that is fuelling the current boom in children’s fashion, evidenced this week by Global Kids Fashion Week, Britain’s first designer fashion week especially for children. Here, well-turned-out little girls and their mothers paid up to £110 for a prime, catwalk-side vantage point.

The opening-day audience was a veritable who’s who of the mummy fashion elite. Model Jodie Kidd and her sister Jemma were in the front row with their respective children, Indio, 18 months, and Mae, three.

Others famous names to attend included Kate Moss’s make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury and Jamie Oliver’s wife Jools, a children’s wear designer.

In order to get the child’s perspective on this fashion circus, I took my eight-year-old daughter Clio. The moment we stepped out of the cab, she was mobbed, like a mini A-lister, by fashion bloggers wanting to take her picture outside.

I was disturbed to think how quickly our children could be tricked into thinking the right clothes can instantly confer celebrity status.

As she looked around inside, Clio was lured by the sight of the mini nail bar — aimed at a new type of child, chillingly branded ‘sweetly sophisticated’.

Here tiny tots as young as 18 months old were getting their nails painted with washable non-toxic polishes designed so their mummies don’t have to worry if they stick their fingers in their mouths. But, of course, it was the catwalk where all eyes were focused.

The very first Global Kids Fashion Week launched by AlexandAlexa showcased top designers A/W designs and drew celebrities like Jodie and Jemma Kidd to the front row

The show had a fun and playful vibe as the professional child models claimed the runway as their own wearing designers such as Oscar De La Renta, Paul Smith, Gaultier and Missoni

hundreds of pounds; a party dress for a five-year-old by Roberto Cavalli
 (who dresses Katie Price’s daughter Princess) will set you back £350.

The luxury children’s wear market is 
booming. It is now valued at £6.5 billion in the UK alone, with every 
major fashion house, from Chloe to Marc Jacobs, offering their own 
junior collections.

It’s not surprising the rich and 
famous are willing to splash cash on children’s clothes, but talking to 
mums at the show, it’s clear how far fashion’s  drip-down effect is 
spreading.

The children cheered, applauded and 
held jewelled iPhones aloft as they watched other small children strut 
down the runway in John Paul Gaultier outfits costing a small fortune.

Sipping champagne at the after-show 
party, Teodora Mihaylova’s sister Donna, with whom she co-owns Happy 
Faces, believes celebrity culture is partly responsible for the growing 
obsession with junior designer brands.

Since Romeo Beckham started modelling 
for Burberry, she has noticed a definite upsurge in the number of young 
customers wearing the label.

Although they start off being 
influenced by their parents, Donna says it doesn’t take long for 
children to catch on that they should look, and be dressed, a certain 
way.

‘There were kids in the front row 
today with dresses more expensive than those worn by the average 
30-year-old,’ she says. ‘But if you bring your child to Kids Fashion 
Week, you’d want your child to compete. I know I would.’

Jodie Kidd, who watched in the front row with her blonde haired son, said of the show 'it was absolutely gorgeous'

Today is a big family day out for 
Carrie Daniels, 25, who has travelled from Bolton with her mother, 
partner and two small daughters.

In order to prove that her baby 
Lily-Ella, eight months, really is dressed top-to-toe in Roberto 
Cavalli, she lifts up her frilly dress to show me her bottom, branded 
with the company’s logo on her tights. Carrie’s partner works as a 
doorman and she is a stay-at-home mother. But money is no object when it
 comes to dressing her little ones. She regularly spends up to £500 on 
designer children’s wear websites and proudly posts her daughters’ 
outfits on Facebook.

Carrie says: ‘When my girls are 
beautifully dressed, nothing else matters. It’s a reflection on me as a 
parent. It doesn’t matter what I wear.  People treat you differently 
when your children wear designer clothes.’

To eight-year-old Kayama Johnson, from
 Hertfordshire, the show is an exciting trip out. She’d dashed from 
school to change out of her uniform into her favourite faux leather 
trousers for the show — in homage to her heroine, popstar Rihanna.

Jemma and Jodie Kidd attended with their own fashion conscious little ones and stopped to pose for photographers after the show

Children have always been a reflection of their parents. But rather than
 reflect our values, nowadays it seems that many parents are more 
worried about whether they reflect their taste in fashion — or spending 
power.

If there is anything that illustrates how parenting is becoming a matter of style over substance, it’s Global Kids Fashion Week.

But while it’s fine to sell the idea 
to adults, who are old enough to know better, is it fair to sell the 
same dream to children, who are so much more vulnerable and desperate to
 fit in?

The organisers are savvy enough to 
head off any accusation that their event might sexualise young children.
 There is not even the slightest hint of lip-gloss and just a sprinkle 
of glitter in the girls’ hair. There are no little ones clacking down 
the catwalk in heels. Instead it’s Doc Martens and Mary Janes. But it is
 still a blatant commercialisation of childhood.

Research has found that children start
 recognising logos at 18 months. By the age of ten, the average child 
has already memorised 300 to 400 brands. Among eight to 14-year-olds, 92
 per cent are specific about which ones they want to buy.

Even before children’s designer wear 
got the stamp of approval from the over-excited reception to this event,
 children were already saying they needed the right labels to make them 
feel ‘special’, ‘make them popular’ and ‘protect them from bullying’.

The PR pitch for this show continually
 tries to stress this event is all about ‘playfulness’, ‘fun’, and 
‘dressing up.’ But as I remember it, didn’t dressing up as a child used 
to be about pretending to be a knight or a cowboy, not mimicking 
grown-up label slaves? Isn’t this obsession with brands really all about
 money?

Educational expert, Sue Palmer, author
 of the book, Toxic Childhood, says: ‘What’s fun for adults  and 
teenagers isn’t necessarily good for children.

‘The earlier you are hooked on 
fashion, the more likely you are to be a fashion victim in the future, 
desperately searching for an off-the-peg identity rather than developing
 a rounded personality of your own.

‘Apart from “best clothes” for special
 occasions, children need outfits that allow them to play freely; 
clothing in which to run, jump, climb and generally mess about.’

After the show, Clio’s verdict on 
fashion remained mercifully child-like: ‘Some of the clothes were nice, 
but I’d spend too much time worrying what to wear if had them — and I’d 
like to do other things, like play with my friends.’

As pressure mounts for the next 
generation to be fashion plates, I hope all our children stay strong 
enough to reject the life of a mini-fashionista in favour of a 
childhood.
