The mother of comedian Tracey Ullman has been killed in a fire caused by the 'careless disposal' of a cigarette.

Mrs Ullman has been left 'deeply saddened' after discovering Doreen Skinner died in the fire at her ground-floor retirement flat in Holtspur, Buckinghamshire, on Monday.

The 85-year-old was discovered by firefighters around 11.20pm.

The comedian allegedly visited the building - which has 28 flats for the over 55s - on Thursday to survey the damage, according to residents.

Earlier this month it was revealed Mrs Ullman - left in 1982, right in January this year - is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic

She became a huge star in the UK and the United States in the 1980s.

Earlier this month it was revealed the 55-year-old is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic.

A spokesman for Mrs Ullman today said: 'Tracey and her family are deeply saddened by the death of her mother, Doreen.

'The family would like to thank everyone for the kind messages they have received and ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.' 

Mrs Ullman, who was born in Slough, Berkshire, described her mother in a previous interview as 'very funny'.

She said: 'My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil.

'But she was very funny and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour.

'Mum worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption.'  

One of Mrs Skinner's neighbours said: 'The fire started in the middle of the night and the poor lady died. We are all very shocked.'

Another added: 'One of her daughters was here. I don't know if it was Tracey Ullman because I didn't see her myself.' 

A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that a cigarette had started the fire in the bedroom late on Monday night. 

'Crews from Beaconsfield and High Wycombe were called to an address in Kiln Court at 11.21pm after an automatic fire alarm activated. The fire had started in the bedroom.

'Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the flat and dealt with the fire and discovered a body.

The flat is one of 28 designed for over 55s in the area. Its windows are still blacked out from the smoke (above)

'Investigations  have concluded that this fire was caused by careless disposal of cigarettes.

'This covers a number of scenarios, including falling asleep while smoking and not putting cigarettes out properly.'

Roger Brinklow, group commander at the rescue service, added: 'Our thoughts are with her family and friends, and the local community.'

The investigation into Mrs Skinner's death has been passed to the coroner who opened an inquest yesterday.
