Lawsuit: Nancy Silberkleit, 59, of Archie Comics, claims Sam Levitin turned against her for rejecting his 'unwanted and improper sexual advances'

A comic book chief executive accused of harassing staff two years ago is now suing her liaison to the company and friend of 40 years over alleged sexual advances.

Nancy Silberkleit, 59, co-CEO of Archie Comics, which is based in Mamaroneck, New York, claims Sam Levitin, 73, turned against her for rejecting his ‘unwanted and improper sexual advances’.

But Mr Levitin alleges in return that Mrs Silberkleit is ‘unstable’ and ‘will greatly damage the business’ if she remains in a position of power, reported the New York Daily News.

He also claims she even once plotted to make Betty and Veronica - the love interests of the comic book’s main character Archie Andrews - more provocative, according to court documents.

The long-running feud began last year when former schoolteacher Mrs Silberkleit - who took over the co-CEO position from her late husband Michael - made Mr Levitin her liaison.

She needed his help as a ‘go-between’ in a court battle with Archie Comics Productions and her fellow CEO, Jon Goldwater - who wanted to fire her, reported the Daily News.

They had alleged she was often unreasonable and would explode into tantrums - such as once surging into a meeting, shouting about male genitalia and storming back out again.

But their relationship broke down last winter when he turned on her for rejecting his sexual advances, according to court papers filed at Westchester Surrogate’s Court in White Plains, New York.

Mr Levitin threatened her and asked if she was intending to get breast implants, Mrs Silberkleit claimed, adding that he once warned her: ‘Mess with me, lady, (and) you’re playing with fire’.

He admitted telling her she was ‘playing with fire’ when talking about rebranding the traditional characters of Betty and Veronica - but denied calling her ‘lady’, reported the Daily News.

‘Nancy is incapable of working with anyone,’ Mr Levitin said in an affidavit. ‘She lacks functional communication skills and has an unstable temperament.’

Mr Levitin and his lawyer did not return a request for comment, ACP said it was ‘not a party in the litigation’ and Mrs Silberkleit’s lawyer said the allegations against his client were ‘just not true.’

Gay wedding: Life With Archie #16 issue last year featured for the first time a same-sex wedding

The hit comic, which was first published in 1941 in 'Pep Comics', has sold more than 1.5billion and is published in a dozen foreign languages.

The Life With Archie series - a spin-off from the original - follows the lives of the Riverdale High School students as they enter their 20s.

In the original series, the characters were at high school and the comic itself is aimed at 16 or 17-year-olds, although many fans continue to read it into their 20s.

In 2010, the Life With Archie series was revived as a magazine-sized comic devoted to stories that grew out of the main character's wedding to his high school sweethearts Veronica and Betty. Archie marries both in parallel universes, so readers get to enjoy two different storylines.

One issue last year featured for the first time a controversial same-sex wedding between characters Kevin Keller and Clay Walker.
