The source of a huge cluster of floating volcanic rocks spotted last week off the coast of New Zealand has been discovered.

Nasa satellite images and earthquake records have pinpointed an erupting undersea volcano called the Havre Seamount as the culprit.

The enormous mass of floating pumice covers almost 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 square miles) and was found drifting in the South Pacific, the New Zealand Navy said on Friday.

The pumice was found half way between New Zealand and Tonga by the NZ Navy while sailing southwest of Raoul Island

The strange phenomenon, which 
witnesses said resembled a polar ice shelf, was made up of lightweight 
pumice expelled from an underwater volcano, the navy said.

An air force plane spotted the rocks on 
Thursday about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) offshore from New Zealand 
and warned a navy warship that it was heading towards them.

Lieutenant Tim Oscar said that while he knew his ship, HMNZS Canterbury, was in no danger from the pumice, which is solidified lava filled with air bubbles, it was still the weirdest thing he's seen in 18 years at sea.

'As far ahead as I could observe was a raft of pumice moving up and down with the swell,' he said.

'The rock looked to be sitting two foot (half a metre) above the surface of the waves and lit up a brilliant while colour in the spotlight. It looked exactly like the edge of an ice shelf.'

Earlier scientists aboard the ship said the pumice probably came from an underwater volcano called Monowai, which has been active recently.

They said the phenomenon was unrelated to increased volcanic activity in New Zealand recently, including an eruption at Mount Tongariro that sent an ash cloud 20,000 feet into the atmosphere.
