Charged: Ray Wilkins arrived at a Surrey Magistrates court for his three-day drink-driving trial

Former England and Chelsea footballer star Ray Wilkins unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade when he was found to be three times over the legal drink-driving limit, a court heard today.

Mr Wilkins, 56, allegedly slurred his words and was unable to stand up when he was pulled over by police as he drove home in May last year.

The Sky Sports commentator is said to have called police procedures a  'f****** joke' when he was told he could not call his wife until he had given breath samples.

CCTV footage played to the court showed the pundit apparently struggling to complete the tests.

Mr Wilkins is heard to say: 'F****** hell, I can’t even phone my missus. This is a f****** joke. I’m not going to bash up anybody... this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.'

The 56-year-old was arrested in the early hours of the morning near his home in Cobham, Surrey after an officer spotted his car 'weaving' down the road moments after it allegedly 'lurched' forward and hit a traffic island.

North Surrey Magistrates’ Court heard that Mr Wilkins was forced to lean on his Jaguar car for support when he was asking to get out of his car.

PC Nicholas Skidmore told the court today: 'There was a strong smell of intoxicating liquor in the vehicle and around him.

'When he got out of the vehicle, he couldn’t stand up properly.

'He had to lean against the car.'

The officer - who claimed he did not recognise Mr Wilkins when he arrested him - said the former footballer fell asleep in his unmarked police car.

The officer was heard questioning Ray Wilkins about his broadcasting job while he was in custody.

In CCTV footage shown to the court, he was heard to say: 'I'm not really into football myself ... are you into it in a big way?'

Wilkins answered: 'I have been for many years, yeah.'

Paul Lund, prosecuting, said Wilkins would challenge the reliability of the result of his breath test.

'Mr Wilkins says that he can't have drunk enough to produce that high reading,' he told the court.

'That, in the crown's submission, is an assertion without merit.

'At the end of the day, the defence is relying on Mr Wilkins' assertion that he hadn't drunk enough ... he would say that, wouldn't he?'

Mr Wilkins, who notched up 84 caps for England during his playing days, was more than three times over the legal drink-driving limit.

Tests revealed he had 104 and 102 
microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - almost three 
times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes.

A roadside reading recorded 109 microgrammes in 100 millilitres of alcohol.

Wilkins stared straight ahead as the CCTV footage was played to the court.

Pc
Skidmore said he was unable to recall everything Wilkins said while in 
custody but added: '(He said) he knew that he had done wrong and he 
wanted to speak to his wife as soon as possible.'

During his career, the former footballer played at various clubs including Chelsea, Manchester United, AC Milan and Queens Park Rangers and was awarded an MBE in 1993 for services to football.

He is standing trial at North Surrey Magistrates’ Court in Staines-upon-Thames, where he denies drink-driving.

The three-day case continues.
