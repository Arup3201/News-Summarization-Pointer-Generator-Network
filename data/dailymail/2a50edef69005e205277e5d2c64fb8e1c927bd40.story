A landlord has won a planning battle against officials to keep a large unauthorised extension which will include a sauna for his student tenants. 

Ikhlaq Hussain was ordered to tear down the front and back additions to the terraced house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, because he had them built without planning permission.

However after a legal wrangle council planners have decided he can keep the extensions, with the number of bedrooms cut from eight to six and, bizarrely, permission for the two rooms to be used as a sauna and laundry room.

Council planners said 'times had changed' and it was now not unusual to have a sauna in a student property, but neighbours have complained a number of times about the development. 

James O'Callaghan complained about an unauthorised extension next door at a student house in Selly Oak which has just been given planning permission by the council - including for a room to be used as a sauna

The council launched enforcement action against Mr Hussain last year after it discovered the extension had been built without permission.

Selly Oak has been the subject of a growing number of complaints about extensions because the area has become popular with student landlords eager to convert family homes to have as many bedrooms as possible.

James O'Callaghan, who lives next door to the property, said the construction had made his family's life a nightmare for the past year. 

He said there had been building disturbance, water damage to his house from poor drainage, and  having to battle the plans at every turn.

'It's caused no end of trouble,' he said.

Residents' spokesman Barry Toon added: 'We are not talking about a naive first time landlord, but a man with a property portfolio in the area.' 

Ikhlaq Hussain won the planning battle to keep the large extension which was built at the front and back 

Permission has been granted for a sauna to be installed at the six bedroom student house in Birmingham 

A retrospective planning application was rejected by officials in August and was upheld on appeal. It was classified as an 'unneighbourly form of development.' 

But chief planning officer Richard Goulborn stuck up for Mr Hussain, who was not present at the meeting.

Mr Goulborn said he had been given bad advice by a previous planning agent and the new application was acceptable.

Asked about the sauna, Mr Goulborn said: 'I am told it is not uncommon to have a sauna in this type of student property.'

'Times have changed,' said committee chairman Coun Mike Sharpe. 

However Coun Peter Douglas Osborn said the enforcement should have been upheld. He said: 'At some point we are going to have to send in a JCB, as much as a warning to any other landlords.'
