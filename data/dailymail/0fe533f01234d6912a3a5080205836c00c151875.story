A woman whose car tumbled 500ft down a mountainside, landing upside-down, was found after police used the Find My iPhone app to track her whereabouts.

The 28-year-old woman, identified as Melissa Vasquez, was driving on Mount Hamilton near San Jose, California, when her vehicle careered off the road at 3pm on Monday afternoon.

As it tumbled down the slope, through thick trees and shrubs, it came to a halt  500ft from the top of the track

Officers began a 15 hour search to find her but were only able to pinpoint her location after guessing the password to her iPad and using the app to find her.

Wreckage: The 28-year-old woman identified as Melissa Vasquez, was trapped underneath her white Chevy for 17 hours after crashing Monday afternoon

Good detective work: One police officer was able to guess Ms. Vasquez's password and was then able to activate the Find My iPhone app which showed her location with pinpoint accuracy 

Apple's Find My iPhone app locates users with a database of Wi-Fi hotspots, cell phone tower locations, as well as the GPS satellite system, and tracks users over time. 

By comparison, General Motors' OnStar system which the woman's car was equipped with. relies solely on the GPS system.

Many smartphone apps that provide navigation information keep track of users' locations over time. but OnStar doesn't work in quite the same way. 

It only keeps track of users locations at discreet moments in time, such as when an accident happens or when they call in to get driving directions from a particular place.  

Victim: Ms. Vasquez, was conscious when investigators found her, and could airlift her to safety

Officers were able to track Melissa Vasquez, 28, using the Find My iPhone app location

After using the iPhone app, police contacted other authorities in the area with her iPhone's pinpointed location, and by 5:30 a.m. a sheriffs deputy spotted her car in a steep ravine.

The woman had been thrown from the car and was lying face down.

The U.S. Coast Guard helicopter were called to airlift her from the scene and be taken to hospital. 

'I am amazed that occurred,' Campbell Police Capt. Gary Berg said of finding the woman through the app. 'I hate to think what the outcome would have been.'

The search initially began  after the OnStar satellite tracking system on her 2012 Chevy Cruze sent out a distress call. 

Police spent two hours searching the area for her car, but found no sign of it.

The search resumed the following morning after the woman's stepmother called police to report her missing after she failed to return home.

It was at that point officers had the idea of using the tracking app to find the missing woman. 

Rescue: The 28-year-old was airlifted to safety and is  in stable condition

Off road: The Chevy left the road at this bend, on a route round Mount Hamilton, near San Jose, CA

Rescuers: Emergency services traced the woman's cellphone to find her on the wooded slope

After two hours, the woman's cellphone provider said the phone was within a seven-mile radius of downtown San Jose, Berg said. 

Campbell Police notified San Jose police, who searched the downtown area, but also could not find any sign of the car.

Campbell police issued a 'be on the lookout' with the vehicle description to all law enforcement agencies in Santa Clara County.

At 3 a.m. Tuesday, the woman's family contacted Campbell police to report her missing, Berg said.

'The family was extremely concerned about her,' Berg said. 'At that point it raised our concern it was something more than on On-Star issue.'

Officer Dave Cameron went to the family's home and asked if the woman has a iPhone. 

Cameron then helped the family use the woman's iPad to use the Find My iPhone, which gave them a location near Mount Hamilton. Berg said Cameron guessed the woman's password - on the third or fourth try - to unlock the iPad and the Find My Phone app.

Cameron, who has been an officer with the department since 1998 and has a mind for computers, tinkered on a computer at Vasquez's home, until he figured out her password. 

'I just tried to make an educated guess,' he said, describing himself as a 'tech geek.'

Area: This is the steep, wooden slope down which the car tumbled a distance of 500ft with the woman inside

If you have an apple device -- an iPhone, iPad or a Mac - you can use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device on a map. 

It'll even play a sound so you can track it down. And if you think your phone was stolen or lost, you can lock it and then track it. 

Or just erase all the information on the phone.

All you have to do is log into your iCloud account and activate the app. 

Campbell police then contacted the CHP and Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office at about 4 a.m. with the new information, including a screen shot of where the iPhone was located. It was 'dead on,' Berg said.

When officers found her she was conscious, but said she could feel pain in her lower body, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.

The woman, who lives in Campbell, California, was flown to the San Jose Regional Medical Center, and had arrived by 9am. She is believed to be in a stable condition.

Authorities said windy conditions made it harder for the chopper to operate.
