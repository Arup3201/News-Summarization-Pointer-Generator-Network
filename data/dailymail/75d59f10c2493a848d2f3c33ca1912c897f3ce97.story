Oprah Winfrey Photoshopped the front cover of the latest issue of her eponymous magazine, which appears to show her lounging alongside an African lion, despite telling her readers they must learn to be braver in the New Year.

According to the Huffington Post, Oprah and her cover co-star Beast never actually got the chance to meet due to fears over the 60-year-old's safety. 

Instead, the 10-year-old lion was photographed the day before the glamorous TV host and was accompanied by his caretaker, who remained on-set throughout the shoot to ensure his every need was catered for.

Not so brave after all: Oprah and her cover co-star, 10-year-old lion Beast, never actually met and were instead Photoshopped together

Plan b: The 60-year-old TV presenter called on the services of set designer George DeLacy, who dressed up in a lion suit and posed alongside Oprah during her shoot

Eager to ensure the cover shoot was as realistic as possible however, Oprah roped in the help of set designer George DeLacy, who gamely suited up in a full lion costume and posed alongside her so she could get her positioning just right. 

Speaking about the cover, Oprah, who has previously shared the cover of O, The Oprah Magazine, with the likes of Michelle Obama, Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell, joked that it was one of the most bizarre shoots she has ever done. 

'I can honestly say I've never done this before,' she joked, while reclining next to Mr DeLacy. 

And while Oprah managed to avoid a confrontation with the majestic animal, photographer Ruven Afanador was not so lucky, however he did shoot Beast from inside a reinforced protective cage, to ensure his safety throughout the day. 

Thus far, Oprah's decision to Photoshop her cover has been met with mixed feelings from readers, some of whom have applauded her 'sensible' choice to respect the animal's natural strength and aggression. 

Discussing the cover on entertainment forum Nairaland, one Oprah fan said: 'Good for her,' while another added: 'Think it's better that she didn't actually pose with the lion!'

The finished product: While the end result looks fantastic, Oprah has faced criticism from some who believe her Photoshop trickery contradicts the theme of the magazine

There are some, however, who feel Oprah's Photoshop trickery contradicts the overall theme of the January issue, which sees readers urged to 'tame your fears and start living your happiest year yet'.

'Although the theme of the issue is "Brave New You", Oprah wasn't actually [brave enough] when it came to posing for the cover,' Refinery 29's Lauren Le Vine wrote. 

'See, she and Beast, her 10-year-old African lion cover costar, posed separately. Beast was photographed one day earlier, and his caretaker was on the site to make sure everything went smoothly.'  

New York Magazine's The Cut's Allison P Davis added: 'Because this cover is meant to inspire a "Brave New You" who will conquer 2015 as fearlessly as Oprah lounges next to a ferocious animal while wearing a sophisticated green velvet gown.

'Except not. As these "behind the scenes" photos reveal, Oprah only posed with a big stuffed animal, NOT A REAL LION AT ALL.

'Her bravery was a mere Photoshop manipulation because of "safety concerns" and also because nothing is real and hope is dead.'
