Millions of people will this week share in the grief of a couple whose six-day-old son died during the filming of a television documentary.

Brave parents Hayley Jackson and Pete Heseltine agreed to appear on Channel 4 documentary One Born Every Minute to raise awareness of baby Kaiden's illness, a rare condition called Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, which makes it nearly impossible to breathe unaided.

Doctors in Leeds battled to save the tiny baby before deciding to turn off his life support machine, in July last year.

Hayley Jackson, 27, lost her six-day-old baby Kaiden to a rare condition called Congential Diaphragmatic Hernia. She agreed to appear on Channel 4's One Born Every Minute to raise awareness of the disorder

Speaking to the Daily Star Sunday ahead of the programme this Wednesday, Hayley, 27, said: 'It was heartbreaking. We were by Kaiden's side the whole time. It was very soul destroying.'

The parents were first told something was wrong at Kaiden's routine 20-week pregnancy scan, when doctors said the baby's heart and lungs were not in the right place and told Hayley to consider having an abortion.

But the prospect of having her child induced was too much to bare and the couple decided to carry on with the pregnancy.

Husband Pete Heseltine, 25, told the documentary of the couple's soul-destroying loss and said they would try for more children

They were told their son would have to be born at Leeds General Infirmary so he could receive specialist treatment.

It was then that Channel 4 approached the couple and asked if they could follow Kaiden's progress.

Hayley said: 'They knew from the start it could go one way or the other. Through the whole thing we tried to remain positive. I did not want to look at what could happen. I just tried to black it out.'

Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary advised Hayley to have an abortion but she says she couldn't bare to go through with it

Pete, 25, said: 'It was very upsetting at the time but I had to be strong for Hayley. It was a bit weird having the cameras there because it was not the best experience for them to be filming but we wanted to raise awareness of the condition and get the message out there.'

The couple say they are now considering having more children.

More than 9,000 people have signed a petition to support charity CDH UK, asking MPs for more funding to research the condition.'

The documentary airs on Channel 4 on Wednesday on Channel 4 at 9pm.
