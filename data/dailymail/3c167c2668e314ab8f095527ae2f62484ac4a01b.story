Tales of sea serpents have haunted intrepid explorers and seasoned sailors for hundreds of years.

And now a rare fish seldom seen by humans that has an incredibly long, undulating body, has been caught on camera.

Oarfish, Regalecus glesne, are the world’s longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and drawings, as well as specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years.

In awe: Oarfish, Regalecus glesne (pictured) are the world's longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years

Regalecus glesne, is the world’s longest bony fish and can grow up to 56ft (17metres) long.

The oarfish is seldom seen by humans as it typically lives between 650ft and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves.

The one spotted in the Sea of Cortés, Mexico measured around 15ft (4.5metres) long.

When the creatures swim into shallow waters they tend to die soon afterwards as they only expose themselves in such a way when they are injured or dying.

The fish’s dorsal fin runs the entire length of its body, which one researcher has claimed can give off electric shocks.

Oarfish can be found in almost all temperate and tropical oceans but are rarely seen.

They are thought to be the ‘sea serpents’ described in old stories.

Now a video has surfaced of a 15ft (4.5metre) long oarfish swimming in the shallows of Mexico’s Sea of Cortés crystal clear waters.

It was taken by experts on a trip organised by Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium, PopSci reported.

While the animal is not the largest specimen to be seen, there is little video footage available for living oarfish for scientists to study, as the creatures typically live between 650ft and 3,000ft (198 metres and 914 metres) below the waves where there is little light.

Oarfish can grow up to 56ft (17 metres) long and have a distinctive dorsal fin that sticks up out of the water in the video.

Like a fish out of water: A video has surfaced of a 15ft (4.5metre) long oarfish, swimming effortlessly in the shallows of Mexico's Sea of Cortez crystal clear waters - far from its usual environment of deep waters thousands of metres below the waves

The creature’s swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal is probably the source of stories about sea serpents.

Its dorsal fin begins just above the creature’s small eyes in a reddish crest and runs the entire length of its body.

Researchers from New Zealand have claimed that it can give off electric shocks when touched.

Oarfish can be found in most of the world’s temperate and tropical oceans, but are hardly ever seen.

They eat plankton and tiny shrimp, jellyfish and crustaceans and are themselves hunted by large oceanic carnivores.

Stuff of legend: The creature's swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal might be the source of stories about sea serpents. This image  of 'a great sea serpent' looks like an oarfish and was found in Hungary Bay, Bermuda centuries ago
