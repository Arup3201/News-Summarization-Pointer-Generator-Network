The Australian Open, dubbed The Australian sauna championships, saw many casualties following extreme heat at the Melbourne tennis grand slam event earlier this year, with temperatures scorching to over 40 degrees Celsius during a four day sweat-fest.

One player hallucinated and fainted, another vomited and suffered severe cramping, while the searing heat also melted water bottles on court and incredibly even melted the soles of one player's sneakers.

Canadian Frank Dancevic hit out at the tournament organisers after he collapsed during his first round match on an outside court, while Ivan Dodig from Croatia said he had wondered if he would die on court.

And it wasn't just reserved for the players, a ball boy fainted during one of the matches while fans had to brave the blistering temps, some without shade.

A wave of criticism followed the heat stricken open, surrounding the lack of transparency about when the 'heat policy' would be implemented which was at the discretion of the umpires.

Tournament organisers were also accused of forcing players to perform in 'inhumane' conditions, which has now led Australian Open organisers to update their 'extreme heat policy' for next year's tournament.

Firstly there's the addition of a third retractable-roof stadium on the new-look Margaret Court arena which will weather-proof the court.

Secondly, the 'heat policy' will be updated to ensure conditions are fair for all players.

'The heat policy, as always, will be applied at the Referee's discretion,' said Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley.

'The decision on implementing the heat policy will take into account the forecast once the ambient temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius, and the Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT) reading exceeds 32.5,' he said.

'When conditions exceed these levels the Referee is taking into account the forecast and state of play when making his discretionary call.'

'We've been gathering data for a number of years now and the forecast process is more sophisticated than ever before.'

'We believe this update will clarify and streamline the communications process for both players and support staff.'

'We've consulted the playing group and this is seen as the fairest way to implement the policy by many of the top players,' said Mr Tiley.

There will also be other changes for matches in progress that will continue until the end of an even number of games in that set or the completion of a tie break, before play is suspended.

'The Australian Open is the only Grand Slam with three-retractable roof stadiums, so it's important to update our policies to reflect the new infrastructure and conditions the players compete in,' Tiley said.

While the new updated policy will be in place for the 2015 tournament, it may not even be needed with news that the weather won't be as hot as this year's competition.

Meteorologist Bob Leighton says long range forecasts indicated a heat wave wasn't expected for next year's Grand Slam set to start on January 19.

'At this stage it's looking like a normal summer, perhaps slightly warmer, with only one day hitting around 40 degrees, and little or no rain forecast,' said Mr Leighton.
