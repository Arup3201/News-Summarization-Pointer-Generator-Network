It was a shocking and controversial scene that prompted more than 200 complaints – and one nomination that has given Joanne Froggatt plenty to smile about.

The Downton Abbey actress who plays housemaid Anna Bates has been nominated for an Emmy as outstanding supporting actress in the wake of her character's rape scene.

The episode was originally shown in the UK last year and aired in the US earlier this year. In the scene Anna is pushed against a wall by Lord Gillingham's valet Green (played by Nigel Harman) and he tries to kiss her. His advances spurned, he beats and then rapes her.

Although the attack was implied through sounds behind a door, ITV faced a backlash from fans and domestic violence charities who accused programme-makers of using rape to liven up the drama's script when it was shown in October last year. It prompted more than 200 complaints to ITV and regulator Ofcom.

However US judges for the prestigious annual Emmy awards felt her performance deserved to be praised.

Speaking at the Audi Pre-Emmy party last week, where the period drama has been given 12 nominations including best actress for Michelle Dockery who plays Lady Mary Crawley, Froggatt, 34, said: 'We are so so thrilled to be here and have 12 nominations, because the competition is so stiff this year - as it is every year.

'There is such great shows this year. We never expected anything. We were saying it was going to be hard, we would be lucky to get a couple of nominations.

'To get 12 is just incredible and we are over the moon and can't believe it and we are so excited just being in the mix.'

The new series of Downton Abbey will air in the UK next month and Froggatt said British fans will see the aftermath of her character's rape and the impact it has on her on-screen marriage to valet John Bates.

She said: 'We will see them trying to move forward and heal themselves from what has happened to Anna.. But as you would expect there is a huge cloud hanging over them and it is not something they are going to process easily or if ever. Rightly so that storyline carries through. Also there is the issue of Mr Green's death.That is hanging over them and there are questions about that.

'There are moments of hope, love and joy for Anna and Bates. It is not all doom and gloom, It would be remise to leave these characters in that situation we have to follow that through and see where that goes.'

Downton Abbey faces strong competition this year from Breaking Bad, True Detective and House of Cards.
