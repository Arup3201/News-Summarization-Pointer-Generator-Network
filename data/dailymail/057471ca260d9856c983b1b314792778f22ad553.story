Fitted on to shells during the First World War, they were designed to set off explosives which would maim and kill soldiers as they took cover in the trenches.

But now hundreds brass firing caps recovered along the Western Front are being melted down and turned into poppies in order to raise money for the Royal British Legion.

The metallic flowers, which will be sold either as cufflinks or lapel pins, are designed to mark the centenary of the War this year.

The 1lb firing caps were fitted into the nose of shells such as these, ensuring they exploded on impact. Now the caps are being melted down and turned into poppies to raise money for the Royal British Legion

The conical 1lb fuses were fitted inside the nose of the shell and were originally made to detonate it as it hit an enemy target.

They were once manufactured by their millions in munitions factories before being shipped to the battlefields.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Brian Gray, the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Shop buyer, said: 'These poppies really are special. For us they are a direct link right back to the battlefields. It feels like reaching out and touching history.

'What is most remarkable is that these objects were created for war but are now being turned into an act of remembrance that will help the Legion and its dependents. It’s turning evil into good.'

The design for each of the poppies is based on an actual flower preserved in the pages of a book by Private Len Smith, whose family agreed it could be used as the basis of a sculpture by York artist Stephen Allen.

TMB Art Metal, which specialises in creating jewellery and works of art from the parts of cars, trains and aircraft, is in charge of making the poppies.

The company was founded by Christopher Bennett in 2005 after a Battle of Britain Hurricane fighter which crashed on to Buckingham Palace Road was excavated, and parts of it were turned into artwork.

The brass caps are melted down before being poured into a clay mould. Once the metal has set the poppy is removed, polished, and engraved with the dates 1914-1918.

The design of the poppy is based on a real flower that was discovered pressed between the pages of a book kept by Private Len Smith (pictured, the Royal British Artillery fire at the enemy in France 1916)

They are then presented in a velvet-lined wooden box with a certificate of authenticity. The mementos will go on sale on the British Legion's website in June, ahead of the centenary of  Britain's declaration of war on August 4, 1914.

Money from the sale of each of the poppies will go to the Legion, with Mr Bennett only recovering the production cost of each one.

He added: 'Considering that they are made of 100-year-old corroded detritus that has lain undisturbed on battlefields for so long, the transformation into beautiful poppies − looking for all the world like 18ct gold − is astonishing.'
