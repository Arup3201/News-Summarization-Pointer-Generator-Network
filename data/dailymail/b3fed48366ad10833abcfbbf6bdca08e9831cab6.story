Newcastle United will make Steve McClaren their No 1 target after confirming that John Carver will remain in charge until the end of the season.

Derby County boss McClaren has connections with the Newcastle hierarchy and is close to chief scout Graham Carr who, along with managing director Lee Charnley, has been tasked with finding the new head coach.

But their search to find Alan Pardew’s successor has been put off until the summer after McClaren declared his intention to remain with promotion-chasing Derby.

John Carver, searching for his first win, will remain in charge of Newcastle for the remainder of the season 

The 50-year-old will take control of Newcastle's last 16  matches and could land job on full-time basis

Carver was on Newcastle's books as a youngster in the early 1980s but never made the breakthrough

As a consequence, Carver was on Monday told to carry on in his caretaker capacity for the remainder of the season. The 50-year-old could yet win the position on a permanent basis if he impresses between now and May 24 and McClaren decides against quitting Derby.

However, Carver is still searching for his first win and takes his side to Hull on Saturday lunchtime. Newcastle are 11th but he has been challenged by Toon chief Charnley to return a top-10 finish.

‘Our goal for the season of a minimum top-10 finish remains unchanged and we are confident that John, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver this,’ Charnley said.

‘At the beginning of this process it was my desire and intention to appoint an individual to the position of head coach who would be available to start immediately. Having now explored at some length the options available to us, the decision has been taken to defer the appointment of a permanent head coach until the end of the season.

‘The head coach will be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of Newcastle United and it is vitally important that we get the right individual.’

Carver, who was a trainee player at the club, returned as a youth coach in 1992 and has served as assistant to Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby Robson and Pardew.

The Newcastle-born coach said: ‘This is a proud day for me. I have worked with, and learnt from the best manager that this football club has had in Sir Bobby Robson. I know what this club means to this city and its people. I believe in my players and the staff I have around me.

‘I am confident that we can deliver exciting, successful football and look forward with relish to my role as head coach of this great football club.’

Meanwhile, Newcastle have won the race to sign MK Dons teenage midfielder Dele Alli. Sportsmail understands the club will complete the signing of the 18-year-old this week for £4million, rising to £5m with add-ons.

Alli will be loaned back to the League One club for the rest of the season.

The England Under 19 player, who was also attracting interest from Arsenal and Liverpool, has scored 18 times in 71 appearances for MK Dons.

Speaking at the weekend, MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said: ‘He can be as good as he wants to be, he has got everything. He is special.’

Newcastle struck a similar deal with Nottingham Forest in the summer for goalkeeper Karl Darlow and defender Jamaal Lascelles.
