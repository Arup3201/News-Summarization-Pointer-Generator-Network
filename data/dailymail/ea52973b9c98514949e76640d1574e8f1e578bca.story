Manchester United will not reduce ticket prices for their FA Cup replay with Cambridge United.

The club had faced calls to lower the cost of admission for the match, which will take place next Tuesday and will be televised.

But they will stick to their regular pricing structure - which will mean thousands having to pay in excess of £50.

United would no doubt point out that there will be more than 11,500 concessionary tickets available which will mean junior season ticket holders will pay £10 and over 65s will not pay more than £20. As with Premier League matches, reduced rates apply for other groups including under 16s, 16-17 year-olds and over 65s.

They have also frozen season ticket prices for the fourth consecutive season.

But the news will dismay many and could lead to a lower than average attendance at the Theatre of Dreams.

United will reportedly  give Cambridge United 42.5 per cent of the gate receipts

The club operate a system where money for cup matches is taken automatically from season ticket holders’ bank accounts.

This year they will be hit by a loss of revenue from gate receipts as they club failed to qualify for European football when they finished seventh last season.
