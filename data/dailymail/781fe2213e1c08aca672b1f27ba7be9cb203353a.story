The London Underground will run a partial service overnight on Fridays and Saturdays, it was revealed today.

But the vast majority of stops on the new night route map are north of the River Thames.

Every ticket office on the Tube network is to be closed by 2015 under plans to fully automate ticket sales and run round-the-clock through-the-night services, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced.

The move will lead to the axing of 750 jobs as the remaining staff are moved from behind ticket office windows to help passengers in the station as the Underground moves for the first time to run 24 hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays on some lines.

The move will push more passengers towards buying electronic Oyster cards or pre-paid over the internet using smart-phones and iPads, or relying on buying tickets from machines in the stations for which additional staff will be on hand to help.

Transport for London (TfL) says the changes will be better for customers and help save more than £40m a year. But the RMT union said it was a ‘lethal programme of cuts’.

The transport authority is facing a budget reduction of about £78m in the financial years of 2013 and 2014.

TfL says six major central London stations will have special customer points to help tourists and that every station will be staffed while the tube is running.

It is part of a series of initiatives that were announced, including improved ticket machines, contactless bank card payment technology from next year, extended Wi-Fi coverage at underground stations, and staff based in ticket halls and on platforms rather than in ticket offices.

All Tube stations will continue to be 
staffed, and billions of pounds of investment will continue, said Mayor 
Boris Johnson and London Underground managing director Mike Brown.

But there was fury and threats of 
retaliation from angry unions angered that the plans will also lead to a
reduction of around 750 jobs out of London Underground’s current total 
of 18,000, which includes 5,500 station staff.

London Underground said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘without any compulsory redundancies.

The plans aim to deliver savings of around £50million a year, or £270million over the term of Transport for London's business plan to 2020/21.

Mr Johnson said: ‘For 150 years the 
Tube has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks 
providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and 
helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city.

‘Now
it is time to take the Tube to the next level and so for the first time
in London's history, we will provide a regular 24-hour Night Tube 
service at weekends.’

He 
said: ‘This will not just boost jobs and our vibrant night-time economy,
it will further cement London's reputation as the best big city on the 
planet to in which to live, work, visit and invest.’

Mr Brown defended the job cuts. He said: ‘People are at the heart of this vision - our customers and staff.

'My commitment to London is that all Tube
stations will continue to be staffed and controlled in future, with 
more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket,
plan their journey and keep them safe and secure.’

The Rail Maritime and Transport union warned of industrial action, adding that staffing levels will be 'decimated'.

General secretary Bob Crow said: 'The Mayor must believe he is some sort of magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while passenger demand continues to rise.

'Throwing in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts to jobs, access and safety.

'We will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action.'

He
insisted: ‘We will continue to make the Tube more accessible and 
provide assistance at stations for all our customers who need it.’

He
stressed there would be continued investment in stations and new trains
and promised ‘a better face-to-face service at our stations, a 24-hour 
service at weekends, with easier and more personalised ways to plan and 
pay for journeys, on and off our network.’

London
Underground said that from 2015 travellers will be able to take the 
Tube home at any hour of the night on Fridays and Saturdays.

Weekend
services will run through the night on core parts of the system, 
initially the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central and Jubilee lines and parts 
of the Northern line.

But 
Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, accused London Mayor Boris
Johnson of being the ‘hypocrite of the decade’, saying the announcement
would lead to the closure of all 268 Tube ticket offices by the end of 
next year:

‘It beggars belief 
that the Mayor who was elected in 2008 on a pledge to keep open every 
ticket office is now planning to close every single one, with all that 
means for safety and jobs.’

They will be campaigning to reverse the decision.

Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan 
criticised a ‘reckless and irresponsible’ reduction in staffing levels: 
‘The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the 
people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more 
anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.’

He
said: ‘Commuters will have nowhere to turn when their Oyster card is 
lost, stolen or broken. It will make the daily commute more difficult 
for everyone but, more worryingly, there are serious concerns about 
whether there will be enough staff at London's busy stations to respond 
in emergency situations.’

Cllr
Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council and chair of the West 
End Partnership, said: ‘When we first established the West End 
Commission at the start of this year, one of the major recommendations 
that came through was to run the tube at later times at the weekend.

‘We
are delighted that our work with businesses, Peter Hendy, and the TfL 
team has now made that a reality. The West End Partnership may be in its
infancy but we are already getting results that will benefit the entire
West End of London.’

Experts
say London’s move towards scrapping ticket offices and switching to 
automated ticketing will be replicated on rail services across the UK.

Under the new Tube system, passengers will from next year be able to use their ‘contactless’ bank cards as Oyster cards, swiping them across automated readers just before they board and after they alight, with payment being taken automatically from their bank account.

Customers will be further encouraged to pre-order and pay for their Oyster cards online.

Thousands of Underground station staff will be given tablet computers holding up to date travel and train information to help passengers.

Wi-fi coverage will be rolled out to  remaining Underground stations by 2014  just as experts predict that internet use by smartphones and tablets is about to overtake that on  traditional computers.

Fewer than 3 per cent of travellers currently pay for their fares at a ticket office, said TfL, which is introducing 150 new ticket machines.

TfL said London’s population is set to grow from 8.4million to 10million by 2030 – or the equivalent of a Tube train full of people every week. For that reason the capital required a system that ‘meets the needs of customers of the  21st century.’
