Two patients have died after contracting a hospital infection in an outbreak that has hit another 14 people.

Edinburgh Royal Infirmary is now investigating a ‘cluster’ of cases of deadly Clostridium difficile, it was confirmed last night.

It comes only weeks after the damning inquiry into the Vale of Leven hospital outbreak, which killed 34.

The two patients who died were killed by underlying conditions, NHS Lothian said, but tested positive for the C.diff bug.

The 14 patients still fighting it have been placed in isolation and infection control procedures are being followed.

Melanie Johnson, executive nurse director at NHS Lothian, said: ‘We have identified a cluster of C.diff at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases.

‘As is usual practice, we isolate symptomatic patients, emphasise the importance of infection control precautions and undertake additional cleaning. We always act as if cases are linked and implement action to prevent cross-transmission.

‘Our robust surveillance procedures meant that we were able to identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action.’

C.diff is a bacterium found naturally in the gut which does not cause any problems in healthy people.

But antibiotics used to treat hospital patients can disrupt the balance of ‘good’ bacteria, causing severe diarrhoea and fever. Elderly and frail patients are most at risk of infection and the most likely to die, with the bug often named as a contributory factor on their death certificates.

It comes only weeks after the damning inquiry into an outbreak at the Vale of Leven hospital (pictured in 2008), in which 34 people died

Last month, a report found at least 34 patients at Vale of Leven hospital in Dunbartonshire died as a result of ‘systemic failures’ by hospital managers.

Doctors failed to notice the infection tearing through the wards for five months, while the hospital’s infection control doctor had not been there for more than a year.

The outbreak in 2007 and 2008 infected 143 vulnerable patients, which victims described as ‘a shame on the conscience of the NHS’.

Cases of C.diff have fallen in recent years. Figures also show doctors are prescribing fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are associated with a higher risk of C.diff.

Edinburgh Royal Infirmary had seen the patients infected over six weeks in five different wards.

NHS Lothian said all affected patients in wards and their relatives had been told about the infection. The affected wards at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary remain open.

Meanwhile, a ward at the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary has been shut temporarily due to an outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea.

Ward 16 has been closed to new admissions, transfers and routine visiting, NHS Dumfries and Galloway confirmed.
