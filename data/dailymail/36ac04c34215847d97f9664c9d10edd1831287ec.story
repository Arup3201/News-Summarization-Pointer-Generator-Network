A British soldier killed in Cyprus was targeted by a gang of thugs high on drugs and carrying flick-knives who had a ‘score to settle’, a court heard yesterday.

Private David Lee Collins, 18, was allegedly stabbed through the heart by Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman when the pair met in a nightclub following an earlier row sparked by North-South rivalry.

The fight between the trio and the soldier had begun earlier in the day when Private Collins, from Manchester, taunted Londoner Osman about his home region.

Accused: L-R; Tukki Abbas Shah and Umar Anwar, both 17, and Mohammed Adulkadir Osman, 19, all British tourists from London are escorted into a court in the town 
of Paralimni in Cyprus yesterdau

Osman told detectives that he was 
holding the weapon that killed the off-duty soldier in the early hours 
of Sunday but claimed he was acting in self-defence.

Today, his parents Lee Collins, 41 and Lisa Minott, 37, paid an emotional tribute read out by uncle Winston Riley at the Fusilier Museum in Bury.

The family said: 'David was an amazing 18-year-old soldier with his whole life ahead of him. The Army was his number one priority in life and he proved to everyone that he could achieve this from a very young age.

'David always thought about everyone else before himself. We are all extremely proud of our little soldier and we are all shattered by our tragic loss.

'We are so happy that David was with his friends and colleagues at the Fusiliers at a memorable time of his life. We just hope that justice can do its course in Cyprus.'

David joined the Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force as a 12-year-old, and his family said he had 'always dreamed of serving his country'.

Fellow soldiers from the 2nd Battalion joined the family in paying tribute to 'a true fusilier'.

Tragic: Mr Collins was stabbed to death at an Ayia Napa nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning

Yesterday Cypriot police re-arrested 
the 19-year-old and friends Tukki Abbas Shah, 17, and Umar Anwar, 17, 
all from London, on suspicion of premeditated murder.

Osman, who is of Somali origin, is 
alleged to have confessed to possession of high-strength cannabis and 
buying 11 flick-knives and two brass knuckle dusters in the popular 
holiday resort of Ayia Napa.

However, he has claimed he was intending to take them back to London for friends.

He admitted there had been a previous 
altercation between the off-duty soldiers and the trio before the fatal 
fight in the Black ’N’ White nightclub.

But Osman maintained that Mr Collins, 
from Manchester, had ‘jumped on to the blade’ which he had drawn in an 
attempt to ‘scare off’ the soldier, who was enjoying a last night out 
before being sent to Afghanistan.

Famagusta District Court heard the 
police claim that three British passport holders had ‘a score to settle’
with Mr Collins and his comrades after an angry exchange in a pub in 
Ayia Napa Square, which was supposed to be out of bounds for British 
service personnel.

Cypriot newspaper Phileleftheros 
claimed that the exchange was ‘racist’, while another, Simerini, said it
was the culmination of a petty argument.

Detectives are analysing CCTV footage of the area.

Lieutenant Stelios Christodoulou told the court: ‘They had a score to settle.

‘We are investigating whether the 
argument was about their different backgrounds, or whether they had met
their victims before in England.

‘The fact that they took knives with them when they went out was suspicious.’

Police found two flick-knives – one 
with blood on the blade – outside the club following the fatal attack, 
the court heard. Lieutenant Christodoulou added that Shah – who, like 
Anwar, is of Pakistani origin – was seen dropping items shortly 
afterwards at the spot where the knives were later discovered.

Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub

Osman, who had a bandage around his 
right hand and a bruised right eye, told police that he did not mean to 
hurt the soldier and was sorry for what happened.

The accused had arrived on the popular holiday island just three days before the alleged murder  last Thursday.

They were staying at the five-star 
Adams Beach Hotel in Ayia Napa. Police found the butts of three 
cannabis joints in an ashtray on the balcony and a sizeable quantity of 
the drug in the room along with the weapons. Osman admitted he had 
bought the weapons at a shop in the resort.

Yesterday the suspects arrived at the
tiny Famagusta court in handcuffs. Shah and Osman covered their faces 
while Anwar looked up at two English-speaking women of Asian appearance –
believed  to be family members – who had been waiting outside the court
for several hours.

The Britons have not been formally 
charged with the alleged murder but were remanded in police custody for a
further eight days while detectives investigate the incident.

If charged they will stand trial in front of a judge without a jury.

A murder conviction in Cyprus carries a life sentence.

Mr Collins, of the 2nd Battalion, 
Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died from a ‘ruptured heart caused by a 
sharp instrument’, according to a post-mortem examination carried out 
yesterday.

The fusilier was stationed at the 
British Army base at Dhekelia but was set to fly to Afghanistan early on
Monday to take part in combat readiness training.

The soldier’s family have said that they have been ‘devastated’ by his death.

A Foreign Office spokesman said 
yesterday: ‘We are aware of the arrest of three British nationals in 
Ayia Napa and we are providing consular assistance.’

The centre of Ayia Napa was declared 
off limits to soldiers after the rape and murder of Danish tour guide 
Louise Jensen by three British servicemen in 1994.

Killed while off-duty: Tributes have been paid to Mr Collins, second left, on Twitter and a Facebook page has been set up in his memory

Up to 9,000 British military personnel
and their family are stationed in Cyprus at bases retained after the 
former British colony gained independence in 1960.

Mike Glover, regimental secretary of the Fusiliers, said: 'David was at the heart of the fusilier family.

He was a fusilier cadet where his enthusiasm and leadership qualities marked him out as a fusilier serving in the 2nd Battalion.

'His commanding officer Lieutenant General Mike Butterwick has said that Fusilier Collins was a true fusilier, honest, hard-working and utterly loyal.

'He wore his beret with pride and soldiering was his life. On behalf of all fusiliers we mourn the loss of one of our own.'

David was a former pupil at St Anthony's Catholic College in Urmston.

A college spokesman said: 'The community at St Antony's College are devastated to hear of David's untimely death. During his time here he developed into a thoroughly well-mannered pupil.

'From a young age he spoke of his desire and determination to join the Army and he succeeded in fulfilling this dream. The college is immensely proud of the role he played.'
