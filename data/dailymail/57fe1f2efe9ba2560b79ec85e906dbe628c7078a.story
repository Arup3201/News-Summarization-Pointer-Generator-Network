Loss: Russ Knight lost his job as assistant frequency coordinator for the NFL during Super Bowl week after posting a photo of his security credential

An Arizona man was sidelined from his dream job working at the Super Bowl after a Facebook post broke a rule he was too excited to read.

Russ Knight, a former DJ, was taking a time out on his job as a cab driver for the opportunity to work as assistant frequency coordinator for the NFL during Super Bowl week.

When the credential for the job came in the mail, Knight was so thrilled he snapped a photo of himself wearing it and posted it to Facebook without thinking.

Just hours later, he told KPHO, an NFL security official phoned with crushing news.

'He said, "Russ, we’ve got a problem,"' said Knight. 'Apparently, on my picture, even though it’s far away, they could zoom in and they could read my credential on the bottom.'

That meant that Knight was given the boot, having broken one of the rules listed on the credential telling the wearer not to post images of it on the internet.

The rule is in place to prevent duplication and as a security measure. 

'I can’t blame anybody else,' Knight said. 'I was the guy. I was the fool who didn’t read the fine print. I was that guy.'

'It hurts real bad,' he added. 

Knight wrote the league a letter of apology, and though he'll watch the game from home he says 'it wont be the same as being on the field.'

Blame game: Knight put the responsibility for his error on himself, and said he'd be watching at home, though it wouldn't be the same 

Showdown: The Super Bowl takes place February 1 at University of Phoenix stadium, where preparations are being made for the big show

NJ.com reports that the NFL may be nervous about  a  scene similar to last year, when 9/11 truther Matthew Mills made it through security at MetLife Stadium using an old press badge from a festival.

Hopping on an employee bus at Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, Mills entered the media tent during post-game interviews, spouting a 9/11 conspiracy theory as MVP winner Malcolm Smith spoke to press.
