Two musicians have staged a creative- and virtual- protest against US Airways after they were banned from boarding a commuter flight with their instruments.

Nicholas Kendall and Zach De Pue were outraged when they were told that they could not bring their violins on board with them on Memorial Day.

When they were refused entry to the plane in Charlotte, North Carolina because the flight crew would not let them carry the instruments on board, Mr De Pue started playing his violin furiously on the tarmac.

Taking to the tarmac: Zach De Pue and of the band Time For Three broke into a ballad when flight attendants wouldn't allow him to bring his violin as carry on luggage

Closing them off: The captain closed off the door when De Pue started playing (and his bandmate was filming)

'The captain and crew told us that our violins were not allowed on the flight! They literally left us alone on the tarmac without any direction. Amazing!' Mr Kendall wrote in the Youtube video caption.

'Are violins dangerous? It's hard enough to make it as a classical musician. Cut us some slack, PLEASE!!!'

The Blaze spoke to representatives from the airline who portray the situation slightly differently.

They said that while it is company policy to allow instruments on as either carry on luggage or checked baggage, that is left up to the flight crew's discretion.

In this case, the flight attendants apparently felt that there was not enough room in the cabin to fit the instruments, but that was not a sufficient explanation for the musicians.

Verbalizing their problems: The band updated their followers on Twitter after being rebooked to a second flight

'I used to think that captains knew about art but I guess not,' Mr De Pue says in the video.

'Bach would be very upset.'

The duo was on their way to Fayetteville, Arkansas to meet their third band member in order to play at the Nature Festival.

After complaining on Twitter and being rebooked on a second flight, the two men were able to get to their final destination.

The frustration didn't end when they boarded the second flight, however, since they thought it was the same sized plane as the first.

The video has been viewed more than 22,000 times since it was uploaded on Monday. It appears as if the internet is on their side, since more than 1,000 viewers liked the video while only 87 have disliked it.
