Diego Maradona was one of the greatest footballers of all time - and this old footage of the Argentine ace playing Futsal reminds us why.

And the former Barcelona and Napoli star showed he was just as dangerous in confined surroundings as he juggled the ball and kept opponents at bay in this old video. 

Maradona played in four World cups, captaining his country to victory in the final against West Germany in 1986.

However, his reputation was tarnished by his Hand of God moment against England in Mexico on their way to the final.
