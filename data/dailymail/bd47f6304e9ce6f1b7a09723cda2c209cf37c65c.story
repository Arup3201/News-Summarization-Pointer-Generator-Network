Britain is becoming too reliant on cheap foreign workers, Yvette Cooper has warned.

In a major speech, Labour's shadow home secretary insisted some immigration is 'bad' and some is 'good', as she attacked the government for failing to do enough to protect the wages of Brits.

But she admitted the last Labour government had been wrong to open the doors to eastern Europeans, and failed to address 'the worries people had'.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper will call for minimum custodial terms for sweatshop owners and gangmasters who base their businesses on employing illegal migrants

Ms Cooper warned employers who engage in the 
‘wholesale’ exploitation of illegal immigrant workers would face 
automatic jail terms.

She called for minimum custodial terms for 
sweatshop owners and gangmasters who base their businesses on employing 
illegal migrants.

She also admitted Labour let too many 
immigrants in by abandoning controls on Eastern Europeans in 2004.

And in a sign the party is hardening its policy on migration, she rejected ‘laissez faire’ attitudes to migrants which ‘treats all immigration as good, and ignores the unfair impact and consequences of different kinds of immigration.’

She said: 'We do not want to live in a society dependent on the exploitation of cheap migrant labour – it’s immoral, it increases low skilled immigration, increases unfairness and resentment.'

She also pledged to stop employers ‘exploiting cheap migrant labour to undercut local jobs and wages.’

Existing laws mean criminals can face an unlimited fine or jail of up to two years if found guilty of the large scale employment of illegal immigrants.

But in many cases gangmasters escape with just a slap on the wrist. Labour would change the law to ensure a minimum custodial sentence for the ‘wholesale’ employment of illegal migrants.

Ms Cooper added: ‘Labour’s approach has changed. As we’ve said, the last Labour government got things wrong on immigration.

‘We should have had transitional controls in place for Eastern Europe.’

‘The figures were wrong, and migration was far greater than we expected.’

‘As a result the pace and scale of immigration was too great and it is right to bring it down.’

‘And we should have recognised more quickly the impact on low skilled jobs, and the worries people had.’

Prime Minster David Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ¿tens of thousands¿ by the election

She said the Government’s approach ‘isn’t working’ and point to the recent rise in net migration by 60,000 to 210,000.

David Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the election.

In one recent case a Wiltshire-based recruitment consultant who systematically exploited 60 Filipino dairy workers was given a suspended jail sentence.

Christopher Blakeney ignored warnings from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and used illegal workers for more than three years.
