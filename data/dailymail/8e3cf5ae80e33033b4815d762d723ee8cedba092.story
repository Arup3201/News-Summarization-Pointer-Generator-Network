Researchers have claimed a major breakthrough in the fight against obesity - and say they have found a genetic switch that controls our metabolism.

Researchers have identified a protein that controls metabolism - and used it to dramatically reduce the development of obesity and diabetes in mice.

By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies cells' energy-burning abilities, researchers say they could now develop new weight loss therapies.

By manipulating the biochemical process that underlies how we burn energy, researchers say they could now develop radical new weight loss therapies.

The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice.

NNMT is known to process vitamin B3 and has been previously linked with certain types of cancers.

The new process hinges on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy. 

This is what allows some people to eat as much as they want, but never put on weight.

Investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) published their research in the April 10 issue of the journal Nature.

The new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice.

'With this discovery, we now have a means of metabolic manipulation that could help speed energy production and lead to weight loss,' said senior author Barbara Kahn.

The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy.

'We all know people who can seemingly eat whatever they want and not gain weight,' explains Kahn.

'Part of the reason for this natural weight control owes to basal cellular metabolism – the body's inherent rate of burning energy.

'A futile cycle is one way to speed up energy utilization in cells.'

The breakthrough also used a technique already used to treat other diseases in humans, raising hopes it could be available soon.

'Our findings are particularly exciting because the antisense oligonucleotide [ASO] technology we used to inhibit the NNMT gene in our study is already being used to treat other diseases in humans,' said Dr Kahn.

The new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, in which cellular reactions are sped up, thereby generating more energy - and allows some people to eat as much as they want without getting fat.

 More than one-third of the U.S. adult population is currently obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

'Obesity is a serious economic burden to our healthcare system and a major risk factor for developing insulin resistance and diabetes,' says Dr Kahn.

NNMT is an enzyme that processes vitamin B3 and has been linked to certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer's disease, said co-corresponding author Qin Yang, MD, PhD, a Klarman Scholar in the Kahn laboratory at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

'Now we have identified an entirely new role for this enzyme in fat tissue, and that is to regulate energy metabolism,' he said.

The investigators first confirmed that levels of NNMT were increased in obese and diabetic mice.

'In a comparison of genetic profiles of fat from mice that were either prone to or protected from developing diabetes, we discovered that the animals that were prone to develop diabetes had a lot of NNMT in the fat and liver,' said Yang.

The team discovered that NNMT inhibition speeds up the so called futile cycle, resulting in more dietary calories being burned for energy and fewer calories being incorporated into fat.

Importantly, notes Kahn, the team used antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology to knock down the NNMT gene.

'Because ASOs have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for the treatment of genetic causes of elevated cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, as well as the treatment of a viral eye infection, it's possible that clinical trials to test an ASO anti-obesity therapy in humans could readily move forward.

'NNMT looks to be a promising target for future therapeutic development.

'Furthermore, because obesity is associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, disease states in which NNMT is also elevated, an NNMT ASO could potentially also be beneficial in managing these other devastating conditions.'
