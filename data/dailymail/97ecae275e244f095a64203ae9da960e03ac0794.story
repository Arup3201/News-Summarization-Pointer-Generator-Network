Ed Miliband today repeated his refusal 
to condemn strike action, despite describing their action as causing 
'terrible' disruption.

The Labour leader's refusal to denounce the strikes follows last week's revelations that almost 90 per cent of his party's funding now comes from unions.

But in the strongest ministerial attack on the unions for a generation, Education Secretary Michael Gove blamed the strike on ‘militants’ who were ‘itching for a fight’ – and warned more than nine in ten schools will be closed as a result of tomorrow’s walkout of up to two million workers.

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, left, refused to condemn public sector workers set to stage walk outs  over cuts to pensions and services. Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove, however, blamed the strike on 'militants'

Hardline trade union leaders were 
yesterday accused of a deliberate attempt to sabotage the economic 
recovery as they threatened a programme of industrial action to continue
 throughout next year.

‘They want scenes of industrial strife on our TV screens, they want to make economic recovery harder, they want to provide a platform for confrontation just when we all need to pull together,’ Mr Gove said.

Officials confirmed that troops and uniformed police officers will be drafted in to help maintain the security of Britain’s borders when immigration staff join the walkout over public sector pension reforms.

Miliband said today he 'hated' the
 effects of the strike, including closed schools and cancelled 
operations, but would not condemn the action.

Referring
 to a headteacher he had seen on ITV Daybreak, Mr Miliband said: 'He and
 many of his colleagues feel that they have been put in an impossible 
position by the Government because the Government has stopped 
negotiating over these public sector pensions.

'They
 are imposing - and I don't think most people recognise this yet - a 3 
per cent tax rise on some of the lowest paid workers in the country, not
 actually to help them with their pension but to help pay off the 
deficit.

'Of course we have to pay off the deficit but to target public sector workers in the way that they have been doing is not fair.

'So the disruption is terrible but I am not going to condemn those who have taken this decision.'

Airlines have cancelled some flights in and out of Heathrow tomorrow in anticipation of queues of up to 12 hours at passport controls.

Dave Prentis, leader of public sector trade union Unison, said there was ‘absolutely no chance’ of reaching a deal in the next few days, claiming: ‘It could be the biggest action since the 1926 General Strike.’

Everybody out: Workers march through central Bristol this summer. Public sector workers have been warned that a pensions offer will be withdrawn if there is no agreement by the end of the year

As David Cameron warned union leaders
 their protest was futile, Mr Gove said he did not know of any pension 
scheme in the private sector that would match the deal being offered to 
public sector workers.

He 
said it was ‘unfair and unrealistic’ to expect taxpayers to keep on 
footing the bill for pension schemes of which private sector workers can
 only dream, warning: ‘If we don’t reach agreement, then change will 
have to be imposed.’

‘Among those union leaders are people
 who fight hard for their members and whom I respect. But there are also
 hardliners – militants itching for a fight,’ Mr Gove said.

‘They want families to be 
inconvenienced. They want mothers to give up a day’s work, or pay for 
expensive childcare, because schools will be closed.

'They want teachers 
and other public sector workers to lose a day’s pay in the run-up to 
Christmas.’

Mr Gove singled out Mark Serwotka, 
head of the biggest civil service union PCS, and Unite’s Len McCluskey 
and Andrew Murray as union leaders for whom ‘militant is a badge that 
fits’.

He also signalled the Government is 
considering changes to strike laws to give headteachers more notice of 
whether they would be able to keep their schools open.

At present, individuals are not 
obliged to inform their school that they intend to join the walkout 
until the day of the industrial action.

Mr Prentis said tomorrow’s action 
would be the start of a devastating series of walkouts, with ‘further 
action in the new year’ if the Government does not back down.

In all, 29 unions are taking part in the one-day walkout, having balloted about 2.6million members.

But any further action could escalate
 if the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing 
decide to take part. Their members are not taking action tomorrow, but 
both unions have suggested strike ballots remain an option.

A PCS spokesman dismissed government claims made on Monday that leader Mr Serwotka had not engaged properly in negotiations.

Public
 sector pensions amount to a risky ‘Madoff-style pyramid’ because they 
are unfunded to the tune of billions of pounds, a think-tank warned last
 night.

U.S. fraudster 
Bernie Madoff was jailed for a scheme which paid investors out of money 
given by future investors, rather than money that had already been 
earned through profit.

In 
an article in the journal of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, 
the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) described the public sector pensions
 framework as a pyramid scheme similar to that run by Madoff because not
 enough money is coming in to cover the sums due to go out.

A
 CPS study forecasts the gap will be £8billion by 2014-15 and will rise.
 Author Michael Johnson said: ‘With what is on the table, the 20 per 
cent of the workforce in the public sector will continue to enjoy 
certainty of income in retirement – that does not exist for the other 80
 per cent.’

Prime Minister David Cameron's 
official spokesman told reporters at a regular daily press briefing: 'Our position throughout has been 
that to go ahead with a strike when talks are ongoing - and they are 
ongoing - is irresponsible.

'Our view is that the offer we have 
put on the table is a good one and a fair one, both for public sector 
workers and for taxpayers.'

Widespread disruption is expected.

The spokesman confirmed that a message
 has been sent out to Whitehall civil servants - including staff at 10 
Downing Street - asking them whether they will be able to help provide 
cover for striking border officials at airports and ports, but declined 
to go into details about what the response was.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it was increasingly 
clear that militant union leaders had ‘set off down this path months 
ago’ and were determined to press ahead regardless of what the 
Government offered or the miserable turnouts in strike ballots.

He
 said: ‘This is a very irresponsible set of strikes. Britain, at a very 
fragile time in its economy, is going to be dealt a serious blow if 
these strikes go ahead in the way that has been described.

‘What
 we’ve said from the absolute outset when we put this new offer on the 
table, which is a generous offer, is that most people in the workforce 
in the private sector would give their eye teeth to have a pension 
scheme as good as what these will continue to be.

‘We
 have said there needs to be agreement on the main elements by the end 
of this year, and if there isn’t we absolutely reserve the right to take
 those elements off the table.’

Meanwhile, Chancellor George Osborne accused Labour of inflaming the situation by peddling ‘misinformation’.

‘Ed
 Balls was saying that people earning under £15,000 are having to pay 
more. We’ve explicitly excluded people on very low salaries from paying 
more contributions for their pensions,’ he said.

‘What
 I am trying to do is give them a good, decent pension for many, many 
years to come – much better than you could get if you were in the 
private sector.’
