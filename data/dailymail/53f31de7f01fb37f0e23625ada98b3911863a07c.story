Jailed: Christopher Grierson, 60, forged travel documents to defraud his law firm out of £1.2million in bogus travel expenses

A senior partner at a top City law firm stole more than £1.2million from his company to help pay for the upkeep of his Lebanese mistress.

Solicitor Christopher Grierson, 60, handed his lover £280,000 and put her up in a New York apartment during an 18-month affair.

But their fling ended when his second wife found out what was going on and he then resorted to stealing from his employers with bogus travel claims to cover his debts.

The father-of-four, who had risen to become 'one of the most highly regarded lawyers in London' was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.

He made 57 false claims using forged documents between January 2008 and May 2011 while working for 
international law firm Hogan Lovells.

The solicitor, who once acted for the
Sultan of Brunei’s brother, Prince Jefri and worked on the collapse of 
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, defrauded his firm out of
£1.27million.

Mark Ellison, QC, defending, told the court: 'In January 2006 he became infatuated with a Lebanese woman in New York and over the next 18 months, until his wife discovered the affair, he spent a total of £630,000, paying rent on an apartment and handing over £280,000 in cash and funding other aspects of her expenditures.

'There’s no doubt his spending had got increasingly out of control.

'He had amassed monthly outgoings of £32,000 not including credit card bills. With credit card bills it was £40,000.'

The
court heard that in the lead up to Grierson fiddling his expenses he 
had owned properties in London and France which both of which had 'large
mortgages'.

But the 
court was told Grierson used his 'trusted' position as a partner to 
carry out a 'planned' and 'sophisticated' expenses scam to get out of 
debt.

Secret affair: Solicitor Christopher Grierson spent thousands paying the rent for his Lebanese lover's apartment in New York as well as handing her £280,000 in cash

Scam: Christopher Grierson claimed travel expenses for numerous fake journeys between Heathrow and LA that he never took

Prosecutor David Levy said: ‘Christopher Grierson, who was a trusted partner of Hogan Lovells - a very important firm of solicitors in the city - made multiple fraudulent travel expense claims totalling £1.274m.

‘Mr Grierson had the authority, because he was trusted as a senior member of the frim to authorise his own expenses, though he had to account for that with supporting documents.

‘He continued, over the period in question, to make significant claims which were totally bogus.’

The court heard the matter came to light when a fellow partner at Hogan Lovells queried a £42,000 claim submitted for travel from Heathrow to Los Angeles.

It was found the claim had been made against a dormant client account that less than ten hours work had been carried out for in the past.

Mr Levy said following the discovery ‘the matter began to unravel’ and Grierson, who was away from work through illness at the time, gave notice that he was to retire as a partner.

He said: ‘He realised the game was up and enquiries had been made into his financial activities.

‘Thereafter he was seen by members of the firm and, as a result of their investigation, it became quite clear he had for a long time abused his trust in a very, very cynical way.

‘There’s no doubt that the motive was financial betterment or greed.’

Mr Levy said that Grierson, who was dismissed from Hogan Lovells in May 2011, had now paid back all of the stolen cash through ‘a loan from a client’.

Grierson became a solicitor in 1976 and rose to become ‘one of the most highly regarded lawyers in London’.

Jailed: Christopher Grierson was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court after admitting four counts of furnishing false information

But in 2007 Grierson had been diagnosed with a ‘depressive illness’ having already been treated by the Hogans Lovell firm doctor for depression and bipolar disorder since 2005.

Jailing the lawyer, Judge John Price said: ‘Unhappily during the period of 2008 to 2011 you took £1,274,414 from your firm.

‘It was well planned, it was sophisticated - you created false travel documents - and you obtained substantial sums of money. It was a serious breach of trust.

‘But it is right to say that you have suffered from mental illness.

‘It is a result of that mental illness that in part you behaved the way in which you did.’

Mark Ellison, defending, told the court twice married Grierson’s illness had been triggered after the solicitor had been 'unable to cope with the enormous stress he felt after the BCCI case collapsed'.

He continued: 'It had been going since 1994 but in 2005 it was terminated, he felt he had been working on something that turned out to be a complete waste of time.'

The court heard Grierson had then ‘tumbled into a period of severe depression’ though he continued to work ‘inordinately hard’.

From May 2009 to May 2010 he worked 3,500 hours and in October 2010 he suffered heart problems and underwent a triple bypass in January 2011.

‘Given the other financial difficulties he already had this behaviour was totally bizarre and, I would submit, a real indication of the extent to which he had become derailed with his thinking and judgement at this time of his life.

‘Such was his judgment around this time he even gave up seeing his doctor.’

Mr Ellison said while committing the offences Grierson was ‘metaphorically sharing the driving seat with a bipolar mental illness’.

Grierson, from Roehampton, southwest London, admitted four counts of furnishing false information between January 2008 and May 2011. He was jailed for three years.
