A woman whose leg grew to three times its normal size, due to a build-up of thick liquid in her thigh, is able to walk normally again after a series of operations.

Annabelle Harrison, 31, has a rare condition called Lipoblastomatosis that caused a tumour to form in her left leg, causing it to balloon in size.

Mrs Harrison, of Banbury in Oxfordshire, was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four years old.

But after numerous operations to remove the tumour in her left leg, both her limbs are now the same size.

Annabelle Harrison, 31, was diagnosed with the rare condition, Lipoblastomatosis, causing a tumour to grow in her left leg, making it balloon in size (left). Following a series of operations to remove the tumour she can finally walk normally again (right, Mrs Harrison's scar after surgery)

‘I am so happy now that I don’t have that limp. I’ve done exercises which mean I can actually bend my knee for the first time since I was a child,’ she said.

Mrs Harrison’s mother first noticed her daughter’s condition when she was four years old and playing on a slide, noticing her ankle appeared to be abnormally swollen.

Mrs Harrison said: ‘My mother took me to the doctors and they realised that I had a thick fluid building up in my leg.’

Experts diagnosed the child with a rare form of benign tissue tumour, called lipoblastomatosis.

As the tumour spread up Mrs Harrison's left leg, doctors feared it would reach her hip and turn cancerous.

‘By the age of 18 my leg had grown to three times its normal size,’ Mrs Harrison said.

The condition caused her to walk with a limp or waddle, making her a target for cruel school bullies.

Mrs Harrison, of Banbury in Oxfordshire, was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four years old. By the age of 18, her left leg had grown to three times its normal size and caused the teenager to walk with a limp or waddle, for which she was bullied

She said: ‘I have always walked with a limp. I used to walk with a waddle and had problems with my back.

‘I used to get picked on because I 
couldn’t run very fast with my leg. The other kids used to chase me 
outside of school as they knew I wouldn’t be able to get away.

‘They called me “fat leg, thin leg.” It 
was horrible but that didn’t really bother me. What really bothered me 
was when they chased me, because I couldn’t run away fast enough.’

Benign lipoblastomatosis is a tumour that typically affects children.

Approximately 90 per cent of cases occur before a child reaches the age of three.

The tumours are typically found in a patients' limbs, head and neck as well as their torso.

It is a rare condition, with around 80 per cent of cases affecting boys.

The tumours usually present as a painless mass in the leg, with around 75 per cent of cases being seen on a patients' left side.

The condition caused a tumour to form on Mrs Harrison's left leg, which caused it to balloon in size.

Thick fluid was building up in her leg, causing it to swell.

She was first diagnosed with the condition when she was four, but it has taken doctors 20 years to control. 

Mrs Harrison, a café worker, avoided wearing skirts and shorts, instead preferring to cover her legs with a pair of loose jogging bottoms.

She said: ‘I just wanted to hide my leg. If I did wear a skirt, I needed the thickest tights I could find.’

Mrs Harrison wasn’t allowed to play sports or go roller skating while she was growing up.

‘I didn’t even learn to ride a bike until I was 15,’ she said.

Mrs Harrison had had her first operation at the age of nine to combat the ever-increasing size of her leg.

Initially, 
doctors tried to control the condition using liposuction, but after 
three failed attempts to remove the thick fluid, they tried to cut the tumour out.

Ms
 Harrison’s final operation took place when she was 24, when surgeons 
removed a large amount of muscle from her thigh to counteract the 
growth.

An MRI scan showed that the tissue tumour was no longer growing and would need no more operations.

Mrs
 Harrison was left with a dent in her leg and no longer has any feeling 
in the left side of her thigh. She also has a jagged scar which runs 
down the length of her leg.

She
 said: ‘My husband’s nephew calls it my Voldemort scar because it’s like
 a zigzag. But I feel so much more confident with the scar than I did 
with a giant left leg.

‘I don’t limp anywhere near as much - even though one leg is longer than the other.

After failed attempts at liposuction, her final operation took place when she was 24 and her legs are now the same size (pictured left). Mrs Harrison how feels confident enough to wear dresses (pictured right)

‘I still hobble sometimes out of habit. I’m so used to walking like that I don’t realise I’m doing it.’

Mrs Harrison still has the condition, but doctors are confident it will not get any worse.

She has lost five stone since the operation, which has made the dent in her thigh less prominent and has boosted her confidence.

Mrs Harrison has been with her husband, Aaron Harrison, 40, for 12 years and credits him for giving her the strength to endure so many procedures.

She said: ‘He’s been with me since I was 19, and was my source of strength throughout the operations.

'He loved me how I was before the operations and before I lost the weight. Now I think he is just happy that I am happy. He is my inspiration.’
