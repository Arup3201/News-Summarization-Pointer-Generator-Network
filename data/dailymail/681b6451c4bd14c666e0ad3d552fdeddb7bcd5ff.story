Chelsea goalkeeping coach Christophe Lollichon has revealed that he has found it difficult to see Blues legend Petr Cech reduced to a back-up role at Stamford Bridge.

The Chelsea No 1 has enjoyed a stunning career in west London over the past decade, but has been forced to warm the bench this season following the introduction of Belgian star Thibaut Courtois.

Cech has performed brilliantly whenever called upon by Jose Mourinho and kept a clean sheet to help Chelsea earn a 2-0 Capital One Cup final victory against Tottenham earlier this month.

Lollichon, however, admits it's been tough to see Cech slip down the pecking order. 

He told the Evening Standard: 'It’s not easy because you’ve got a goalkeeper like Petr who is at the top of his form.

'I have a relationship with Petr, who is a special person. We’ve been working together (at Chelsea) for eight years. Our relationship goes beyond just the sporting side.

'There is always that moment when a young goalkeeper arrives.'

Jose Mourinho has decided to hand Belgian star Thibaut Courtois a regular spot in Chelsea's starting XI

Cech looks set to leave Chelsea in the summer after he revealed he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois. 

While accepting Mourinho's decision, Cech, who can class Arsenal and Real Madrid among his suitors, said the situation could not go on indefinitely.

The veteran stopper said recently: 'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo.

'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this,' he added while on international duty for the Czech Republic who play Latvia in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague on Saturday.'
