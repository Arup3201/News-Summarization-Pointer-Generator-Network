George Osborne today announced that he would put £340million towards fixing Britain's battered infrastructure by repairing potholes and building new flood defences.

Following the winter storms which left areas of the country underwater, the Chancellor announced that he would be making an extra £140million available for repairs to flood defences and providing £200million for local authorities to repair potholes.

The winter storms flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation, with Somerset among the worst-hit areas after the wettest winter since records began.

Hurricane-force winds and flooding led to felled power lines and blackouts for more than 100,000 families, while it has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £830million.

Much of the country’s transport network was plunged into chaos, with roads and railways wrecked, and countless buildings damaged.

The Government was also forced to call in troops to help rescue stranded victims.

Today's announcement follows David Cameron’s promise during last month’s crisis that ‘money is no object’ in clearing up the damage and preventing a repeat.

However, the extra money promised today by Mr Osborne has been criticised for not going far enough in solving either issue, with the flood defence fund described as a merely a 'sticking plaster' by Dr Colin Brown, Director of Engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

'The £140 million announced in today’s
 Budget for repairs to UK flood defences is a "sticking plaster" 
approach and simply does not go far enough,' he said.

'The
 Government needs to be investing in new flood defences and ongoing 
maintenance projects to ensure long-term UK resilience, neither of which
 was mentioned by the Chancellor. Equally, there was no mention of 
resilience plans for other extreme weather conditions which the UK will 
be increasingly susceptible to in future years.

'Every
 £1 spent in resilience saves £4 in future relief and rebuilding costs, 
which is why we need to be taking a much longer-term view of UK 
infrastructure.

'Elsewhere, 
the Institution welcomes the Chancellor’s proposals to provide £7 
billion to cut energy bills for manufacturers in energy-intensive 
industries.

'These 
initiatives will help UK firms become more competitive in the global 
market by reducing costs and encouraging them stay in the UK.

'The
 Institution also welcomes the continuing support for graphene, a truly 
British invention with a multitude of future possibilities.  The 
creation of a new centre of excellence will advance the already 
committed £111m to graphene research and exploitation, and will help the
 UK reap the commercial benefits this miracle material.

'Additionally,
 while we welcome the support for HS2 and regional airports and the 
Chancellor’s vision of seeing this beyond the current plans, we need to 
see more details and the Government needs to show more commitment to 
creating an integrated UK transport system.'

Liz Peace, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation said that the flood defence money was welcome, but raised concerns over flood insurance police.

'We are pleased to see that the 
Government is committed to spending on flood defences and helping those 
that have been hardest hit by the recent storms, but today's 
announcement of £140m funding to repair flood defences do not assuage 
our fears about the government's new flood insurance scheme, Flood Re, 
which currently stands to expose thousands of homeowners to rocketing 
insurance premiums,' she said.

Friends of the Earth economics campaigner, David Powell said also criticised the Government's pledge, and said that Mr Osborne had not done enough to address climate change.

He said: 'Merely weeks after promising action on flooding and global warming, the best the Chancellor can manage is a U-turn on his own reckless flood defence cuts, and caving in to big business lobbying on pollution tax.

'Mr Osborne says he wants to make our economy "resilient", but Britons face paying a hefty price for his failure to confront the reality of climate change.'

He added: 'George Osborne’s self-congratulation on flood spending is ill-founded.

'The "extra" £140m only cancels out previous cuts, while households in storm-battered Britain are picking up the bill for the Government’s negligence.

'And if we want to keep pace with the impacts of climate change, far more must be spent on flood defences.'

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, welcomed the £200million put aside to repair potholes, but said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog.

‘A succession of bad weather, including the recent floods, has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome,' he said.

'But the drip, drip of funding does not address the £10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified. It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.’

Tony Ball, vice chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, welcomed the extra funding, but said the country was facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040, and the situation on the roads was getting worse.

'This announcement does not go anywhere near far enough. We urge the Government to provide a full and comprehensive package, including the resurfacing of roads, rather than funding in dribs and drabs.'

Mr Osborne also announced a number of other transport measures.

There will be a guarantee of up to £270million to support the raising of debt finance for the Mersey Gateway Bridge - a project that will see a road bridge over the River Mersey in north west England.

Also, the Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne further north into Scotland, if the Scottish Government will match fund the costs of the study.

Mr Osborne said that the Government had agreed that the Welsh Government can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the M4.

The UK Government is also financially supporting the Greater Cambridge enterprise partnership's transport and infrastructure plans in a deal that could be worth up to £500 million over 15 to 20 years.

Mr Osborne said the vehicle excise duty (VED) car tax would increase by the RPI rate of inflation from April 1 2014 but, as announced earlier, VED rates for lorries will be reduced and restructured from April 1.

Campaign for Better Transport chief executive Stephen Joseph said: 'The Chancellor has done little to reduce the everyday cost of transport which remains one of the biggest costs faced by households

'The £20 million tax break the Chancellor is giving to bingo halls would be better spent reversing the planned cuts to bus services this year. Extra money to tackle potholes is welcome, but this is a drop in the ocean against the £10bn backlog to local road repairs. These are the issues that matter to people rather than big road building.'

Sustainable transport group Sustrans said: 'Any money to repair this winter's damage to our roads is welcome but, considering the £10 billion road maintenance backlog, £200 million is nowhere near enough.

'Potholes are dangerous for all road users. Resolving this crisis will save lives.'
