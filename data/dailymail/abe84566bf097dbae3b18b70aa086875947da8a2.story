Crystal Palace are hoping to keep Gerry Francis at the club as they plan for life without Tony Pulis.

The Eagles parted company with the 56-year-old last week before a last gasp opening day defeat away at Arsenal on Saturday.

Pulis’ assistant David Kemp has left Selhurst Park but they are keen on Francis to stay put because of the wealth of experience he carries.

Shock! Tony Pulis left the club after failing to agree on transfers with co-owner Steve Parish

That could prove particularly important if Tim Sherwood ends up landing the vacant managerial position. The ex-Tottenham boss has held talks with co-chairman Steve Parish and several bookmakers suspended betting on him taking over.

It is understood that the race for the job lies firmly between Sherwood and Malky Mackay, the latter of whom has ties with sporting director Iain Moody. The pair were instrumental in Cardiff City’s rise to the Premier League.

Keith Millen took charge of the weekend’s game at the Emirates and is likely to remain in some capacity.

Palace are hoping to make an appointment in the next 48 hours ahead of the visit of West Ham United.
