General Sir Richard has criticised Cameron for risking becoming a 'foreign policy irrelevance'

The crisis in Ukraine could lead to ‘total war’, Britain’s former Nato chief warned yesterday.

His stark warning came as the French and German leaders flew to Moscow to thrash out a peace deal – without David Cameron.

General Sir Richard Shirreff also criticised Mr Cameron for not doing enough to persuade Vladimir Putin to pull back from Russia’s intervention in the country, saying he risked becoming a ‘foreign policy irrelevance’.

His comments came as the Defence Secretary said Moscow’s aggression proved the need to update Britain’s nuclear capability.

Downing Street insisted Britain is playing an ‘active role’ in Europe’s response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, despite the fact that Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande were spearheading the diplomatic effort to end the conflict.

The German chancellor and the French president yesterday met the Russian president in the Kremlin to discuss a peace plan aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatist rebels.

Western diplomats said that Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande – who on Thursday met Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in Kiev – went to Moscow with a repackaged version of a peace plan originally drawn up by Mr Putin. The new version is reported to have dropped what were said to have been the most objectionable elements of the Putin plan in order to meet the concerns of the Ukrainians and the Europeans.

Sir Richard, Britain’s former top Nato commander, said the UK should be playing a major role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war.

He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘This is the most serious crisis to have faced Europe, arguably, since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. 

'There is a threat of total war. 

'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent.’

And he told the Times that Mr Cameron should be with the German and French leaders in Moscow, presenting the peace deal.

‘Where is Britain? Where is Cameron? He is clearly a bit player. Nobody is taking any notice of him. He is now a foreign policy irrelevance.’

Last night there were also signs of a split between Britain and the US. While US secretary of state John Kerry refused to rule out the arming of Ukraine fighters, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said such a move risked ‘escalating’ the conflict.

Mr Fallon also said Britain must update its own nuclear deterrent in response to Russian modernisation of its nuclear forces.

Downing Street sought to play down suggestions of a rift with France and Germany, insisting that the visit was part of the so-called Normandy Group process.

‘It was always clear that it would be a French and German visit,’ said a spokesman.
