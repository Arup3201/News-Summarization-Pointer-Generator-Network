The inquest of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko could examine the possible role of British spies in his death.

Both MI6 and the Russian secret service, the FSB, could become interested parties in the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death, set to be held next year.

At a pre-inquest review at Camden Town Hall today, it was also revealed that certain government departments have not yet handed over material relevant to the inquest which was asked for in January.

New questions: Former Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko in his hospital bed, at the University College Hospital in central London. The inquest into his death will examine the role of MI6 and the Russian secret service, the FSB, it is claimed

Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a meeting, allegedly with two Russians - former KGB contacts Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun - at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square.

A further pre-inquest review will be held in December to decide on the full scope of the inquest.

Hugh Davies, counsel to the inquest, today said it could extend to include 'the possible culpability of the Russian state', as well as 'the possible culpability of the British state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko either: one, in carrying out by itself or its agents the poisoning; or two, failing to take reasonable steps to protect Mr Litvinenko from a real and immediate risk to his life'.

Mr Davies said the Russian state has been invited since January to become an 'interested party' in the inquest, but it has not yet taken up the offer.

Mr Davies said there were a 'number of competing and increasingly controversial theories' surrounding Mr Litvinenko’s death.

He said the inquest’s scope could also include involvement of other parties, including friend Boris Berezovsky, Chechen-related groups and the Spanish mafia.

It had been speculated that Mr Perepilichnyy was poisoned in a similar manner to former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko who died after being contaminated with Polonium 210 in 2006

'It appears to be common ground that these issues require determination in December,' he told the hearing.

'Should the possibility that Alexander Litvinenko died as a result of an accident be included in the scope of the inquest and should the possibility that Alexander Litvinenko committed suicide be included within the scope of the inquest?', he added.

Maya Sikand, for Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina, said if the Russian state could not become an interested party, then it was possible the FSB could.

'It may be that what should also be considered is whether MI6 should be invited to either apply or be so designated,' she added.

She said while the suggestions Mr Litvinenko may have committed suicide or died in an accident were 'distasteful' to his widow, and there was 'not a shred of evidence' to support them, Mrs Litvinenko was prepared to see the theories examined in the inquest.

Mr Davies also told the court that certain government departments and agencies, asked to supply relevant information in January, had still not handed it over.

'It has become apparent that a number of departments or agencies that do hold or may hold material have not yet complied with the request of making the material available for inspection,' he said.

Neil Garnham QC, representing the Home Office, said departments asked for information were the Atomic Weapons Establishment, the Cabinet Office, Home Office, Foreign Office, Health Protection Agency, the Ministry of Defence, intelligence and security agencies, and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Each had started searching for relevant material, and expect to hand it over within weeks, he said.

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said she hoped to end speculation surrounding her husband’s death.

She said: 'I believe it is important, not just for me and my family and my friends, it’s important for the two countries.

'It’s important for Russia and England because this relationship is quite difficult and I think everybody needs to know what happened to Sacha (Mr Litvinenko).

'I would just like to know the truth because I want to stop all speculation.

'The most difficult thing to me was of course listening about an accident and suicide, and I want to stop it.'
