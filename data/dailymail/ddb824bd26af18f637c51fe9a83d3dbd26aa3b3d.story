Paramedics tried for 30 minutes to save the life of Andrea Edwards, aged 26, but she died at the scene

A young mother-of-three died after plummeting 12 floors to her death - just minutes after she told her family she was going out for a cigarette.

Andrea Edwards, 26, was believed to be visiting the home of her children’s father in Bell Green, Coventry, West Midlands, before she was found dead at the bottom of a tower block.

Neighbours said her daughter and ex-partner ran to her aid after she went out onto the balcony for a cigarette but hadn’t returned after ten minutes on Sunday night.

A man living on the 6th floor of Dewis House, said: ‘I was outside and heard screaming so looked around the side of the block.

‘I heard a loud popping bang and saw a woman lying on the ground, in a pool of her own blood.

‘I phoned the police but they had already had several calls and were on their way.

‘A man and a young girl came out of the block and ran over to the body, she tried to hold her mum but her head was partially decapitated.

‘Her dad pulled her away and they stood crying - the police were there within a couple of minutes.

‘Paramedics were with her for almost 30 minutes but clearly nothing could have been done.’

Another resident, who lived on the 4th floor of Dewis House said: ‘I had just started watching the Olympics Closing Ceremony.

‘I saw a shadow go past the window and a loud scream.

‘I looked out and saw a body on the floor and a large pool of blood.

‘I recognised her face as I have seen her around the block with her children.’

Ms Edwards was pronounced dead at the scene.

She lived around half a mile away from where she died, on Sycamore Road, Coventry, West Midlands, and her three children, Sienna, Kia and Joshua.

A woman and her daughter who live opposite Andrea said: ‘People in the area have been saying that she fell from the tower block after going out for a cigarette.

‘Apparently one of her children went out to find her and saw her body on the ground - it must have been terrifying for them.

‘I knew Andrea to say hello to - she was always playing out on the grass with her children, she was such a good mum.

‘They were all always well turned out and wore nice clothing, she really looked after those little ones.’

Flowers and tributes have been left at the base of the Dewis House tower block, which include messages from her children.

They left an emotional note to their late mother, which read: ‘To mum, I love you so much. I will not forget you. From Sienna, Kia and Joshua.’

Andrea’s mother also left a tribute to daughter, which said: ‘Words can’t describe how I feel right now.

‘You were taken from me so suddenly and I just wish so much I could have done something.

‘I love you so much Andrea and I always will, Mum.’

Andrea’s sister, Pamela also left a message for her treasured sister, which read: ‘I’ll never forget such a special sister.

Residents in the area that Andrea lived in paid tribute to a ‘polite and beautiful’ woman who adored her children.

One resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘She was always taking them out everywhere, they were her life.

‘She said she would be lost without them.’

A Facebook tribute site named ‘R.I.P Andrea Edwards from Coventry’ has also been set up to remember the loving mother.

Andrea’s niece wrote: ‘R.I.P Auntie Andrea. Still doesn’t feel real, keep expecting this to be all a bad dream. So upset for you and for your babies that you’ve left behind. We’re all in pieces babe, I’ll love u forever and ever love me an Mia’

Detective Sargeant Paul Jones, from West Midlands Police said: ‘Police were alerted to the fall just after 9pm following a call from the ambulance service.

‘It was clear nothing could be done to save the woman, 26, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘The woman’s next of kin have been informed and the matter referred to the coroner.’

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with Andrea’s death.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: ‘Crews were called to reports of a woman who had fallen from a block of flats.

‘The woman was immediately assessed at the scene but unfortunately it became apparent that nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed deceased at the scene.’
