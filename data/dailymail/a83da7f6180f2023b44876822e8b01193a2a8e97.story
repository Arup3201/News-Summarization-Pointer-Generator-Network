Electrocuted: Hannah Defoe, 20, was killed in a freak swimming pool accident in St Lucia

A devastated mother wept today as she told how relatives battled to save her daughter who was electrocuted in a hotel swimming pool in St Lucia.

Hannah Defoe, 20, the cousin of England footballer Jermain Defoe, was killed when she dived into the water while on holiday on the Caribbean island last summer.

Her grieving mother today begged to hear the 'truth' about how her child died as she described the close-knit family’s agonising wait for answers.

Hope Defoe, 50, clutched a picture of 
her daughter as she told an inquest hearing relatives had been fobbed 
off with 'excuses' from St Lucian authorities for more than a year.

Mrs Defoe emailed an official in the island’s tourism department last night to plead for action.

'You were all so kind and gracious when we were in St Lucia, promising to help us,' she wrote. 'But we have been abandoned.

'Hannah died because she took a swim 
in a hotel swimming pool. She was 20 years old and it was three weeks 
before we were to celebrate her 21st birthday.

'We haven’t even been told if anybody has been charged.

'Look your daughter in the eye and then imagine her electrocuted and lying in a pool, at the bottom, for an hour and a half while you and others are suffering electric shocks as you try to rescue her.

Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe was given permission to return home from the club's pre-season tour of the U.S. last year after news of his cousin's death

'Now imagine nobody tells you how or why that happened but fobs you off with polite excuses.'

Mrs Defoe cried softly as she added: 'Are you imagining that? Are you feeling the rage and desperation?

'Now try to get on with a normal life as it dawns on you that you may never be told the truth of what happened to your dead child who took a swim in a pool on holiday.'

Hannah, a performing arts student from Enfield, North London, was on holiday as a reward for her hard work during her first year at the Performers College in Essex when she was killed.

The inquest heard how the water in the pool registered 180 volts when tested the day after the incident.

Reports at the time said Hannah's aunt Janet and cousin were taken to hospital after getting electric shocks as they tried to save her.

Tottenham Hotspur striker Defoe was on the club’s pre-season tour of America when he was told the news of her death. He returned to the UK to be with his family.
