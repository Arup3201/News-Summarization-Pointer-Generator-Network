Pele will be a guest at Anfield on Sunday to watch the crunch top four battle between Liverpool and Manchester United.

The Brazilian great, now 74, appeared in a TV advert with Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge ahead of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil.

He is at Anfield as part of his commercial work with Subway Restaurants, who are one of Liverpool's business partners.

Pele played in Liverpool, across the park at Goodison, for Brazil in 1966, but he limped off injured

It is not Pele's first visit to the city, the Brazil legend having appeared as a player for Brazil at Everton's ground Goodison Park in 1966 during the World Cup finals.

However, he does not have too many happy memories of Liverpool, having been forced to limp out of the tournament after being given rough treatment by Bulgaria and Portugal.

The two sides are both in the hunt for a Champions League spot, and both come into the game in good form, with Liverpool's last league defeat coming at the hands of United back in December. 

Juan Mata scored the final goal when the teams last met in December, making it 3-0 to United

David de Gea was in fine form for the clash of the two giants, denying Mario Balotelli on several ocassions

Balotelli has since fallen out of favour at Anfield, and is unlikely to start against United on Sunday
