Her green jacket caused a social media storm after its phallic shaped neckline was pointed out.

Now Australian presenter Natarsha Belling has received support from a fellow news anchor after the sartorial buzz reached the United States.

Reporter Dion Lim, who reports for the Ten News channel in Tampa, Florida, wrote: 'Oh c'mon. People ur reading too much into this! Anchor wears "phallic" jacket #anchorproblems.'

Belling wore the jacket to present Network Ten's Eyewitness News and a photo of the outfit was then liked over 110,000 times on Facebook after the website Unilad posted the caption ‘once you see it, you cannot unsee it’.

The image has also been shared over 7,000 times as the comments over Belling’s outfit rage on.

'Once you see it, you cannot unsee it...': This photo of Natarsha Belling's green jacket has been shared thousands of times online

The bemusement and fascination with her top appears to stem from the fact when you first look at the photo it’s hard to notice anything – but once the neckline’s shape is pointed out it’s hard to 'unsee' it.

Ruben Haywood wrote on Facebook, garnering 26,408 likes: ‘Like if you came here to find out what it is.’

Sarah Herbert wrote: ‘Yep, definitely cannot unsee this now.’ And Chris Thompson added: ‘Thank you, you have enlightened me on this picture.’

‘You legend I couldn't find what was happening but you've made me at ease now,’ Adam Baldwin said.

Social media users laughed as they all realised what the joke was about 

One Facebook user pointed out 'you gotta have one to find one'

On Reddit, one commentator mused: 'I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster'

And Lourens Odendaal realised: ‘Ooo that’s what it was… now I get it.’

Meanwhile, on Reddit, one commentator mused: ‘I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster about to burst from her chest.’

And another added: ‘I thought it was the slight crease in her v neck on the right side, yet the top was the same length… I was sure it wasn’t that so came to the comments.

‘I guess this means I'm growing up, because five years ago I’d see this straight away.’ 

The 39-year-old is an Australian national news presenter on the Network Ten
