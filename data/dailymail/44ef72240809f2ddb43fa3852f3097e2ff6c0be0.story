U2 musician Bono celebrated St Patrick's Day in style in the south of France, and even took time out to watch Arsenal's Champions League tie with Monaco.

The 54-year-old  was at the Stade Louis II in the French principality to watch Arsene Wenger's side brave attempt to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit and earn a place in the quarter-finals.

The Gunners fell just short despite a 2-0 win, exiting the competition on the away goals rule.

Bono was spotted talking to fans before the game and took his seat alongside band-mates Larry Mullen Jnr and The Edge.

With Monte Carlo being a wealthy place and a millionaire's playground, it should come as no surprise to see a celebrity at a big football match. 

Bono's rock band U2 have sold over 150 million records worldwide over almost 25 years.

The Irish band will be on tour once again from May, starting with North America before heading to Europe later in the year.

Prince Albert of Monaco was also in the crowd at the game, naturally supporting the home side
