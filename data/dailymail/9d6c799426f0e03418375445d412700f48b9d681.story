Red hot Tottenham striker Harry Kane treated his childhood sweetheart Katie Goodland with a Valentine's trip to Marbella.

The Spurs star has already netted 23 goals for Tottenham so far this season and jetted off for some sun as Mauricio Pochettino's side were not involved in the FA Cup last weekend.

The pair dined at Marbella's La Sala, which is part-owned by former Spurs team-mate and good friend David Bentley.

The couple stayed at the 5-star Puente Romano hotel for two nights as Kane enjoyed some time away from the relentless Premier League campaign and also managed a couple rounds of golf with Bentley.

'He is an amazing guy and an all-round professional. He doesn't drink, but he knows how to have a good time,' Bentley told the Olive Press.

'I sorted him and his girlfriend out with a place to stay for two nights and played golf with him too. 

Roy Hodgson indicated he will pick Harry Kane for the next England squad, having impressed with Tottenham

'We have been friends for years,' added Bentley, a former Spurs player himself.

Meanwhile England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed he will pick Harry Kane for his next England squad, as the Three Lions play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on March 27.

'Harry Kane? He is an all-round centre forward, can play right up there against a centre back, or come off and see a pass,' Hodgson told the BBC during his stint as a pundit at Deepdale on Monday as Manchester United beat League One side Preston 3-1.

'He's got technique, he's always looking to get on the end of crosses, that header against Arsenal was a really classy header. I thought that was a wonderful,' added Hodgson.

'If all goes well and he stays fit I'm pretty sure he'll be in the next squad.'
