This chilling series of images give an alarming projection of how some of America’s most famous tourism destinations could look in the future if scientists predictions about the effects of global warming prove correct.

Pittsburgh-based researcher and artist Nickolay Lamm, 24, has created the shocking photo illustrations which show many of American’s most iconic destinations including the Washington Monument, Statue of Liberty and Miami’s South Beach submerged in up to 25 feet of water.

It could take several centuries for sea levels to rise to that level but Lamm hopes his work will raise public awareness about the very real threat of global warming today, reports StorageFront.

According to the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated  study released earlier this year, the consequences of climate change are now hitting the United States on several fronts, including health, infrastructure, water supply, agriculture and especially more frequent severe weather.

The report claims observable change to the climate in the past half-century ‘is due primarily to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuel,’ and that no areas of the United States are immune to change.

‘Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont have observed changes in their local climate that are outside of their experience,’ the report said.

Months after Superstorm Sandy hurtled into the U.S. East Coast, causing billions of dollars in damage, the report concluded that severe weather was now the new normal.

‘Certain types of weather events have become more frequent and/or intense, including heat waves, heavy downpours, and, in some regions, floods and droughts,’ the report said.

Last year was the hottest year ever in the United States.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate 
Change, the seas will rise by an average of 6.6 feet by 2100.

Then over the coming centuries, as temperatures rise and ice sheets melt, the oceans could rise as much as 20 or 30 feet.

Lamm has created images which show how famous landmarks could look like under 5 feet (projected increase over the next 100 to 300 years), 12 feet (potential level in 2300), and 25 feet (the potential level in coming centuries) of water.

The U.S. National Climate Assessment report notes that of an increase in average U.S. temperatures of about 1.5 degrees F since 1895, when reliable national record-keeping began, more than 80 percent had occurred in the past three decades.

With heat-trapping gases already in 
the atmosphere, temperatures could rise by a further 2 to 4 degrees F in
 most parts of the country over the next few decades, the report said.

Certain positive consequences of rising temperatures, such as a longer growing season, were said to be offset by more disruptive impacts, including:

‘This draft report sends a warning to all of us: we must act in a comprehensive fashion to reduce carbon pollution or expose our people and communities to continuing devastation from extreme weather events and their aftermath,’ Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who heads the Senate environment committee, said in a statement.

Some Democrats hope President Barack Obama will use his executive powers to clamp down further on some carbon-polluting industries.

Obama has cited climate change as a priority since being re-elected in November, 
although many Republican lawmakers are wary of declaring a definitive 
link between human activity and evidence of a changing climate.
