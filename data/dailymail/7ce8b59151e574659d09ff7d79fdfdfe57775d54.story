A mother-of-eight has been ordered to appear in court on charges that she forced her adoptive daughter to eat cat litter and attempted to sew the girl's mouth shut.

As Rana Cooper, 46, left court in Washington County, Pennsylvania following the preliminary hearing on Thursday and told reporters: 'I am a good mother, a very good mother.'

Immediately after the hearing, her 51-year-old husband, Richard Cooper, was arraigned on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child after he allegedly failed to stop the abuse.

The 16-year-old girl, who was adopted by the couple when she was 10, explained that she was abused because the woman considered her 'embarrassing to the family', which has seven sons.

Accused: Rana Cooper, 46, told reporters outside court on Thursday that she 'is a very good mother' - but her adopted teenage daughter claims she force-fed her cat litter and toothpaste and physically attacked her

'She scooped cat litter with a scooper and shoved it in my mouth while holding my throat,' the girl claimed in the court, WPXI reported.

As the court was shown images of wounds to the girl's arms and legs, she described other alleged abuse, the channel reported.

'Any time mom was yelling or choking me or punishing me, the dog would bite me and latch ahold of my arm and tear into my skin,' she said. I have scars and a big hole in my leg because of it.'

Prosecutors said that Cooper forced her daughter to earn points to eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that she once attempted to sew her mouth shut with a needle and thread but stopped after piercing her bottom lip.

The girl added that her father threatened to leave because Cooper wouldn't stop hurting the girl.

'My mom was mad and bit my nose, twisting my neck and dragged me across the room,' she said.

Rana Cooper, from Avella, received bail of $100,000.

'I don't think this child understood how horrific these things were,' Traci McDonald, an assistant Washington County district attorney, said, the Observer-Reporter reported. 'She thought it was discipline.'

As she left court, she told reporters that she was a 'very good mother' and the only time she held her child's head under water - as the teenager has claimed - was to wash her hair.

The alleged treatment came to light in May while child welfare authorities in Washington County were investigating an alleged assault at the girl's school.

State police Cpl. Robert Copechil said he interviewed officials at the girl's school and was able to verify her story through a guidance counselor's notes and concerns a teacher had noted.

Cooper was charged with assault, child endangerment and reckless endangerment.

Police reports have detailed even more sickening incidents, including how she allegedly forced the teenage girl to scrape the inside of a toilet and eat what was on her finger.

In other incidents, she allegedly sat on the child for minutes at a time, force fed her until she vomited, made her eat half a tube of toothpaste and jammed a Q-tip into her ear causing partial loss of hearing. 

According to the girl, Cooper bit her nose until it bled, hit her in the face with a metal belt buckle and forced her to stand in the corner on drywall screws.

The mother also allegedly threatened to gouge the teen's eyes out and slice off her tongue. 

'If it was time to eat and no one else was around, mother would allow child to eat and would make the child shovel food quickly into her mouth,' wrote state police Cpl. Robert Copechil.

Scene: The girl was adopted by the couple in 2008, when she was 10, and claims that she has since endured years of abuse. Her father has also been charged for failing to do anything about the abuse

'Mother would then make the child tell mother that she was eating one of her brothers.'  

Rana Cooper gave police a written statement last month in which she admitted to holding her daughter's head under water for three to 10 seconds, police said.

However, Cooper's 24-year-old son, Ronnie, has come to his mother's defense insisting that the allegations of abuse against her were false.

'Nothing, none of that happened,' Ronnie Cooper told KDKA. 'None of these are true.'

The girl has since been removed from the home and put in the care of an older brother and another caretaker.

Washington County Children and Youth Services have removed all of the other children under 18 from the home.
