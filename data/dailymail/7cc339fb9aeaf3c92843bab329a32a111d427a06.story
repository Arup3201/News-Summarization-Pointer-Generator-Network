High life: Alex Hope, 25, pictured with reality TV star Layla Flaherty, posed as a City high-flier to earn millions

A catering manager who posed as a City whizzkid to run a £5.6million Ponzi fraud spent £2million on champagne, nightclubs and casinos, a court heard yesterday.

Alex Hope, 25, told investors he could make them a fortune from foreign exchange trades.

But the ‘City high-flier’ was in reality a former catering manager at Wembley Stadium.

He used the cash from investors as his ‘personal piggy-bank’, spending £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne – a Nebuchadnezzar, which holds 15 litres – Southwark Crown Court heard.

He repaid them using cash from new investors in the fraudulent Forex scheme.

Hope frittered away almost £1million in casinos and racked up bar bills of £500,000 mixing with stars at exclusive nightclubs after he reinvented himself as a Forex trader.

He boasted of his rags to riches story in the Daily Telegraph in May 2011, claiming he made his fortune after reading a book on how to trade currencies during his commute to Wembley.

Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘He promised investors and potential investors huge returns. In truth this was not a real trading scheme at all... it was a classic Ponzi fraud. He used their funds as his personal piggy-bank. A massive amount was spent on himself.’

Hope got through £2million in the 13 months before his arrest in early 2012, she said.

‘The investors who put in the money in good faith had no idea this was happening.’

The jury heard that Hope paid a PR company £3,000 a month to promote his image as a successful trader.

He bragged about his financial wizardry, claiming he made £600 profit on his first day of trading the dollar against sterling and in only two and a half months his initial £500 stake had grown to £2,500.

Jurors were played a showreel video of
 Hope in which he boasted of his success saying: ‘You don’t get many 
young people working in the City doing what I do. I like to do a lot for
 people – I’m not doing this just to make money for my business but also
 to create jobs for others.’

The
 film, produced by his cohort Raj Von Badlo, was uploaded on YouTube in 
February 2012 while Hope was trading losses of £500,000 and had 
liabilities of nearly £2million.

The catering manager claimed he learned how to make his millions from reading a book on his commute

He is alleged to have used new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme.

The court heard that Hope also began teaching novice traders how to spread bet, even though he was making huge losses whenever he dabbled in the currency markets.

Retired teacher Christopher Millard ploughed £15,000 of his redundancy package into Hope’s scheme after attending his training sessions.

Hope promised to double Mr Millard’s 
initial £10,000 investment within three months, but used the money to 
fund his lifestyle, Miss Clarke said.

After
 suspicions around his Forex fund grew, City of London police raided 
Hope’s flat in Canary Wharf and arrested him last April.

His cohort Raj Von Badlo, pictured at Southwark Crown Court yesterday, made a video of Hope boasting

Von Badlo, who is said to have promoted the fraud, then withdrew £95,000 from cash machines, the jury heard.

Hope denies fraud but admits violating City rules that he must have a licence to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit.

Von Badlo, 56, denies concealing £95,000 in criminal property, carrying on a regulated activity when not authorised and making misleading statements.

The trial continues.
