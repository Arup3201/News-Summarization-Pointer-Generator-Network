It is one of the best kept secrets in the art world and has long been at risk of falling into disarray and dilapidation. 

But now a house designed 200 years ago by artist JMW Turner is to be saved from crumbling into obscurity. 

Sandycombe Lodge, the only house designed by the artist, has been given a £1.4million grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund. 

Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham in London, a property designed and lived in by artist JMW Turner and his father William, has been saved with a £1.4million heritage lottery grant and will be restored throughout 2015 before it can be opened to public viewings from 2016

The grade II listed, painted by Turner's contemporary William Havell, was placed on the English Heritage at risk register in October 2013 because of its condition 

The funding will not only allow vital repairs to be made to the house in Twickenham in London but will also mean it can be opened to the public and fans of the artist, whose first love was architecture.

Turner designed and built Sandycombe Lodge in 1813 as a country retreat for himself and his father, a retired wigmaker who worked in Covent Garden. 

The property was later used as a 'shadow factory' for designing airmen's goggles.

It was eventually sold and has recently been in the hands of a private owner, but its dilapidated state meant it was at risk and was only open to the public once a month or for special bookings.

The dilapidated front door and crumbling window arches of Sandycombe Lodge led to fears that the building would crumble into obscurity

The distinctive archways and winding staircases were designed by Turner for the Twickenham property showing his love of architecture 

The grade II listed house was put on the English Heritage at risk register because of the large amounts of damp in the property and its damaged ceiling. 

But it will now be restored over the next 12 months to return it to its previous condition, with some of the later additions made to the building removed so it resembles the house that Turner lived in. 

Catherine Parry-Wingfield, chairman of the Turner House Trust, said: 'The Heritage Lottery Fund's award is the most wonderful news and will allow the Trust to bring this beautiful building back to life.'

The restoration means the property will now be open to the public for 46 weeks a year.

The Turner House Trust said it feared without the grant Sandycombe Lodge could not have survived another winter and more downpours 

Sandycombe Lodge was passed through hands of private owners but has been in desperate need of repairs to the walls and ceilings  

Turner designed and lived in Sandycombe Lodge, a retreat for himself and his father William, for 13 years until he sold it to a private owner 

Turner kept hold of a meadow next to Sandycombe Lodge which he later sold to railway developers for a substantial sum of money 

The dilapidated front gate and ceilings, one of which has collapsed at the Grade II listed home, will be restored throughout this year 

'We are just so excited, it is superb news – this house is a national treasure, but it is in a sad, sad state, and if we had to get through another bad winter without knowing whether we could go ahead with restoration, it would be truly worrying,' Rosemary Vaux, of the Turner House Trust, told the Guardian. 

Ms Vaux said the property was badly damaged during last winter's heavy downpours and storms.  

The funding means the house will close this year while vital repair and restoration work is carried out so it can be open to the public from 2016. 

The Turner House Trust launched a campaign last year appealing for £2million to help them restore the house to its former glory of 200 years ago. 

Preliminary sketches by Turner for the design of the house can be seen at the Tate Britain. 

Turner designed and built Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham in London in 1816. 

He created the house as a retreat from his own studio in Harley Street and as a haven for his father, William Turner, who had retired from his role as a barber and wigmaker working in Covent Garden. 

JMW Turner was born in 1775 and was a successful watercolour painter

The artist is believed to have done some of his watercolour work while he was at the property. 

Sketches for Turner's design of Sandycombe Lodge can be seen at the Tate Britain, and are a revealing example of the artist's true desire to become an architect. 

Turner owned the property for 13 years until 1826. 

It is the only surviving property in the country designed by a major artist for his own use.  

While Turner painted and designed his father took on the role of gardener and housekeeper at the site. 

Friends, including Alexander Pope, were invited for lavish picnics at the property. 

In declining health himself, Turner sold the house in 1826 to Joseph Todd, a self-made business man in the London haberdashery trade. 

It was later passed to his son-in-law James Morrison, who became a fan of the artist and collected many of his paintings. 

George Duckett Barber Beaumont, a barrister, gentleman antiquarian and inventor of a traction engine, was the next owner and is believed to be responsible for adding several extensions to the property. Some of these will be removed during the restoration process this year. 

Turner retained a small meadow close to the house until 1848 when he sold the land to Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway Company as the train systems began to develop and be built across the UK. 

During World War Two the house was used as a 'shadow factory' - a factory concealed as a private house to hide it from enemies - for making airmen's goggles. 

In 1947 the house was acquired in a poor state by Professor Harold and Ann Livermore who remained committed to restoring it and keeping Turner's memory intact. They helped set up a trust which became the Turner House Trust in 2005.
