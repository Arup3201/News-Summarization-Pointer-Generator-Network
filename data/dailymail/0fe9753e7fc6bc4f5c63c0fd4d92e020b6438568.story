English cricket is deluding itself. In its desire to prove Alastair Cook is the right man to consign the Australian car crash to history, it has created a fresh sequence of accidents, each more wreckage-strewn than the last.

Being bounced out by Mitchell Johnson was just about understandable, a potent mix of physics and fear. But Ishant Sharma, a bowler who has spent much of his career being mocked by Indian fans, who has a Test average in the late-30s, and who had to be persuaded by his captain to bang it in short? This was the kind of nadir that makes other nadirs looks like imposters.

Yet when the third Test starts in Southampton on Sunday, the captain will still be Cook and the head coach will still be Peter Moores. Success, we will no doubt be assured, will be just around the corner – a corner which has somehow become a long road to nowhere.

Time to walk away? Alastair Cook struggled again at Lord's and is not the right man to lead England

Troubled: Cook's batting has suffered and England have not won for 10 Test matches

Cook spoke on Monday afternoon of his determination to put things right and his desire to be in charge when fortunes change. These are noble sentiments. But such things don’t happen by themselves. His past record is no guarantee of success in the future. In fact his Test average of 45.34 is at its lowest ebb for nearly four years.

Right now, the impression given by those who run the English game – from ECB chairman Giles Clarke via managing director Paul Downton to Moores and Cook – is that the desire for change will in itself be enough. The platitudes are ringing increasingly hollow.

It was reasonable to give Cook a chance to prove that the Ashes whitewash was an outlier. That was his first Test series defeat as captain out of six, and credit remained in the bank after the win in India. But the second chance depended, naturally enough, on events this summer. That’s how sport works. It is, as Cook might put it, a simple deal.

All sportsmen have an internal contract: to admit to fragility is to strike at the contract’s very essence, for half the trick is to convince yourself that you are still the man for the job. That’s why there is usually a time lag between the truth dawning on outside observers and reality hitting home with the man under pressure. With Cook, we are currently mid-lag.

This column wrote after the Headingley defeat by Sri Lanka that he should no longer be captain. It seemed obvious then that he lacked the imagination and authority to impose himself on a game, let alone outwit the opposition.

A few funky fields at Trent Bridge clouded the issue: it’s been said often enough that such tricks are not the point of captaincy. And on the first day at Lord’s, England flunked it a la Headingley.

It’s certainly true that his senior bowlers let him down. But good captains spot the danger and change tack. They have the force of personality to tell their experienced new-ball attack to pitch the damn thing up on the greenest top seen at Lord’s for decades. If the new-ball attack fail to respond, or refuse to pitch it up because they’re petrified of being driven through extra cover and having their analyses damaged, then on come the change bowlers.

MS Dhoni has lapsed into all kind of strangeness during his time as Test captain, but he was miles ahead of Cook at Lord’s, bringing on Ravindra Jadeja as early as the seventh over of England’s second innings (he trapped Sam Robson first ball), and instructing a reluctant Sharma to bowl an over of bouncers just before lunch on day five (he had Moeen Ali caught at short leg off the last delivery).

The best that can be said about Cook’s leadership is that he appears to have created an environment on which newcomers feel more welcome: Robson, Gary Ballance and Moeen have all prospered early in their careers.

But such inclusivity can lapse into over-indulgence. Matt Prior didn’t look fit in the first Test at Trent Bridge, missing three catches low to his right of the kind he once had for breakfast. To compound the error by picking him at Lord’s, where he dropped Murali Vijay on the first morning, said little for England’s judgment.

He steps down, possibly for good, with the gratitude of England fans, but also with the suspicion that his struggles have epitomised the dressing-room’s lack of honesty with itself.

Moores not merrier: Peter Moores' second spell as England coach is proving a chastening experience

Then there was the general refusal to admit that England had fluffed their lines with the ball on the opening day, when India should have been skittled for 150. There can be no more complaints about the pitches.

Cook, at least, has acknowledged that both his own lack of form and England’s winless streak cannot continue, while at the same time showing little capacity to remedy either malaise. Things could get worse – even worse – before they get better.

And Moores? His reappointment as coach was dubious after an initial stint that included four Test series defeats out of seven, including the first at home by India in 21 years. Now, following the heist by Sri Lanka, he risks extending his record to six losses out of nine.

People who know Moores well speak repeatedly of his enthusiasm and energy – and couldn’t we all do with more of those? But the evidence suggests that whatever it is he said he learned from his first spell in charge is yet to take effect. Earlier this summer, Sri Lanka won the lone Twenty20 international, the one-dayers and, for the first time in England, a Test series. Now India have won their first overseas Test for three years. England keep ticking off the wrong kind of history.

The danger is they will keep on making the same mistakes until the lag is no more. But by then, another Test series will have come and gone.

Who, in any case, would replace Cook? The absence of potential leaders is another poor reflection on the English game. Ian Bell can’t buy a run, while the last thing a rejuvenated Joe Root needs is to be weighed down by the captaincy.

If there is a way of squeezing Eoin Morgan into the Test team, England should seriously consider it.

There’s something likeable about this Indian team – the dash (and tache) of Shikhar Dhawan, the old-school application of Cheteshwar Pujara, the classy modesty of Ajinkya Rahane, the egoless line and length of Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Even MS Dhoni’s rambling answers at press conferences take on a certain charm when he’s in one of his mischievous moods.

Just one request. Can Virat Kohli, the captain-in-waiting, concentrate on celebrating wickets with his team-mates rather than go out of his way to agitate the fallen batsman or even – as happened at Lord’s yesterday – the fallen batsman’s partner? It ain’t a good look.

The agitator: Virat Kohli (left) should celebrate more wickets with his team-mates and not rile opponents

What is the truth about so-called chief executive pitches and the near-mythical status of the cash-bringing fifth day? The feeling at Trent Bridge was that groundsman Steve Birks’s deathly slow surface was part of Nottinghamshire’s grand plan to make money on walk-up ticket sales on the final day – though Birks was apologising as early as day one for a pitch subsequently rated ‘poor’ by ICC match referee David Boon.

Yet a senior figure at the ECB assured the Top Spin during the Lord’s Test that this was little more than ill-informed hot air. Apparently, it actually costs a county money to host a fifth day, because grounds are rarely full, hospitality cannot be sold in advance and stewards still need to be paid. The perfect Test, we were told, finishes on day four. If this version is true, what happened at Trent Bridge was more cock-up than conspiracy.

At a time when national boards are beefing up their online presence, the question arises about what their role on the internet should ideally be. Are they there simply to spread information, or should they be applying a cheeky spin?

There was no doubt which angle Cricket Australia chose last week when they published a video detailing the lowlights of Matt Prior’s summer. They should be careful what they wish for: next in line as England wicketkeeper is Jos Buttler, a superstar in the making. And now he should get a decent crack at Test cricket before the 2015 Ashes…
