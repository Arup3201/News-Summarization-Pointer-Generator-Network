Arsenal are ready to challenge Manchester United for German centre-half Mats Hummels.

So far United have failed to agree a fee with Borussia Dortmund for the World Cup winner, with the German club wanting a sum in excess of £25million.

Arsenal, though, could come up with the cash after the sale of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona on Saturday.

Should United withdraw their interest in Hummels they are likely to turn to Holland defender Daley Blind with Ajax set to sell for around £17m.

And United are hoping to seal the £25m signing of Colombia forward Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina by the end of the weekend.

Tottenham could make a move for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez this week.

Hernandez looks surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and has attracted several Premier League clubs, including Southampton.

But ideally the Mexico striker would want to move to a bigger club and Spurs could fit the bill.

Tottenham could help finance the deal by offloading misfit centre forward Roberto Soldado, who is wanted by Atletico Madrid to replace Diego Costa following the latter's move to Chelsea.

Sam Allardyce’s position as West Ham manager remains extremely precarious.

Indeed, an insider at the club recently told someone that Allardyce was a 'dead man walking.'

FIFPro is the continental arm of the players union.

They are there to protect the interests of players.

So why do they seek the defend Luis Suarez for a deserved and arguably lenient ban for committing an assault on a fellow professional player at a World Cup?

Such are vagaries of the doping rules that one PL club is being frustrated in their attempt to help treat one of their players.

The prominent player is said to have some psychological issues…broadly speaking in the bi-polar spectrum.

It has been recommended he would benefit from a medication that is commonly prescribed by doctors. But the problem is that one of the constituents of the medication comes up on the list of the banned substances.

Manchester City are slight favourites to win the Community Shield. I fancy a draw - Click here to get on 2-2 at 12-1 with Coral.

Harry Redknapp is set to make another bid to lure Andros Townsend from Tottenham.

Rangers boss Redknapp rated Townsend when he was coming through the ranks at Spurs and sent him out on loan to better his development.

Townsend lost his way after Redknapp left Spurs but forced his way into the first team last season with some dazzling displays and only missed out on the World Cup finals because of injury, although he had suffered a dip in form.

Redknapp is willing to offer £10million to his former club, who may take the cash as they reshape their team.

Monday: Paul Scholes comes out and says that Steven Gerrard should not be proud of his England career, which is a bit rich from Scholes given how he underperformed at big tournaments for his country.

Tuesday: Gary Lineker says England should boycott the 2022 World Cup in Qatar because of corruption. Far better for the FA to lead the fight to force FIFA to oust Sepp Blatter and his cronies, reform the set-up, then offer to stage the 2018 finals instead of Russia and promote the USA to host World Cup 2022.

Wednesday: Louis van Gaal says Man Utd are not ready for the new season. For a manager who claims he won’t play mind games, a clever way of easing the pressure ahead of the club's New Dutch Dawn.

Thursday: West Ham’s new £12million singing Enner Valencia claims the club can challenge for a Champions League slot…then it is revealed the Ecuador player won’t be fit for the start of the season. What a joke all round.

Friday: After being whipped over two legs by Legia Warsaw, Celtic get a Champions League reprieve after UEFA rule against the Polish club for fielding an 'ineligible' player who came on for the last few minutes of the second leg. Talk about the rub of the green.

Back Heel

The FA made a big play this week of actually releasing figures to show that at least some of the money made from staging the Community Shield is pumped back into charity.

So it should. After all, it used to be called the Charity Shield because when it was first set up in its current format of Champions versus Cup Winners way back in 1930, the majority of proceeds were meant to go straight to, well, charity.

But in 2002 the Charity commission found that the Football Association had failed to meet its obligations under charity law.

The commercialisation of the what was once hailed as the 'curtain raiser to the season' (that now happens on pre-season tours to the USA and Far East) began in 1974 when the game was first staged at Wembley, having previously been played at one of the competing club’s grounds.

The match between Leeds and Liverpool remains etched in the history of football for three things

It was the last game Bill Shankly led Liverpool out before retiring.

It was first proper game of Brian Clough’s ill-fated 44 day reign at Leeds.

And it saw both Kevin Keegan and Billy Bremner sent off after a full scale scrap.

Off you go: Leeds hard man Billy Bremner (left) and Kevin Keegan are dismissed in the 1974 charity Shield

Brawl: Leeds Norman Hunter (centre) restrains Liverpool's Keegan in the ill-tempered affair

After Keegan had gone over the top on Bremner, Johnny Giles hit Keegan in the face with a right hander.

Even back then, that attack ranked as sending off but for some reason Giles only got booked.

But after played resumed, Keegan and Bremner's tempers spilled over and they slugged it out -literally - stirring the crowd to cry out a familiar chant of the day: 'You're gonna get your f****** heads kicked in.'

Both were sent off and both left the pitch having taken off their shirts and thrown them to the grounds. Even if football was rougher back then the moral standards so were much higher.

Because it was seen that both players had brought shame onto the English game on Wembley’s 'hallowed turf' Keegan and Bremner were suspended by the FA for ELEVEN games and fined the huge sum for the day of £500.

For the record, the match ended with Liverpool winning on penalties.

Stop Press

West Ham are set to battle Newcastle for Connor Wickham if they don't land Peter Crouch.

With Andy Carroll out for the first months of the season The Hammers need to bolster their strike force.

West Ham have offered Stoke £1million for 33-year-old Crouch. Stoke want £3m.

If a compromise can't be reached then the Hammers will consider making a move for Wickham.

Up and at 'em: West Ham will go after Sunderland striker Connor Wickham if Peter Crouch does not sign

Veteran: The Hammers are hoping to snap Crouch up at a cut-price £1million from Stoke City

The player has yet to agree a new contract with club and has been issued a 'sign or go' ultimatum by manager Gus Poyet.

Wickham is available at a cut price £6 million given that his contract is running down.

West Ham would probably need to offload one of their squad players to finance a move given their budget for transfers .

Ironically Poyet could also be a target for the Hammers if the club eventually part company with Sam Allardyce

Libero

One of the arguments the FA offer to defend the ridiculous £100m-plus cost of the St George’s Park training facility is that at least it’s a great HQ to teach coaches.

Yet more and more ex-pros and wannabe coaches are now opting to take their badges in Wales, under the Welsh FA, because the courses are far cheaper.

Two of the most recent high profile ex-Premier League players to graduate there were former Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann and France World Cup winner Marcel Desailly.

That is a great example of how cosmopolitan the English game now is - but clearly the FA are doing something wrong and as it stands the misguided St George’s Park project is not fit for purpose.

BTW 

It is now over two weeks since Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward left the club’s US tour to go and get some business done.

As in secure the signings that manager Louis van Gaal wants to rebuild United’s 'broken squad'.

Buying players is far from a perfect science, which is why United have an extensive wish list.

All smiles: But Louis van Gaal hasn't been able to recruit all the new stars he wants for Manchester United

But progress has been slow.

Woodward did a great bargaining job securing a world record kit deal with but he is not such an expert in the jungle that is the transfer market, as was proved last summer.

One wonders how long it will be before there is friction between Van Gaal and Woodward if United don't get the players the Dutch coach wants - and soon.
