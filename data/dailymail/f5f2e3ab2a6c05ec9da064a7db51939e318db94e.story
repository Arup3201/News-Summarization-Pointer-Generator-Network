A performance artist wound up in jail after pulling a fake penis out of his pants during a protest at a Miami art show.

Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer,' familiar to commuters on New York's L train, was with about 30 others protesting the wealthy at Art Basel when he reportedly tried to fight off police trying to get him out of the building.

As they tried to remove him from the show, Sherrard decided this was the moment to yank out his surprise.

Look at me: Kalan Sherrard, an 'avant-garde nihilist subway performer' was arrested after pulling a fake penis out on  police during a protest at Art Basel in Miami

'The unknown item was discovered to be a prosthetic penis sex toy,' according to a report from Miami Beach Police Officer Alex Delgado as quoted in The Miami Herald. 'The item was impounded.'

The officers at first thought it might be a gun. 

He was charged with disturbing the peace and resisting an officer without violence.

The Miami New Times reports that the altercation started at about 4 p.m. when Sherrard and his partner Maria Paz Valenzuela started a disturbance. 

He was playing with a balloon while she read a manifesto from the Art Basel site.

Sherrard was screaming 'F--- Art Basel, F--- all you rich people.'

The pair were part of a larger crowd wearing masks and protesting the wealthy. 

Despite Sherrard's years as a performer, police say they were still completely confused by what statement he intended to convey with the fake penis. 

'It's like the chicken crossing the road question,' Detective Vivian Thayer told reporters.

In an interview with New York magazine earlier this year, Sherrard said he performed because 'I think it has to do with being really bored of the world, sort of — both really bored and really interested.'

On Thursday Sherrard was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents

Speaking to the Herald after his arrest, Sherrard claimed he was told by security officers he was dressed 'too artistically' to be in the event.

After begging strangers for their clothing he claims to have gone on 'a very basic anti-world rant' before security and police took notice and engaged him. 

Both he and Valenzuela were released the next day after each posted $1,500 in bail  

The Miami New Times notes that this was Sherrard's second arrest of the week. 

On Thursday he was busted for 'disorderly conduct' and 'wearing a mask on the street' according ot court documents. 

He wrote of that incident: 'Yesterday I was arrested for Dancing and Wearing A Speaking Costume, and imprisoned for 24 hours in Miami-Dade county's series of incarceratory complexes. 

'It was a Kafkaesque nightmare of juggling and impossible echoes of choice, but in the end my friends and family came through and bounced me out. Thank you so much. Minus A Day, Plus the complete clarity of repose, withdrawl, meditation and disjuncture, incarceration unfailingly punctuating the entrenchment of white supremacy, privilege, and complicity. It is a spinning knife.

'In jail I remembered everything. I came back to myself.'
