A giant fish has almost knocked two fisherman from their tinny after it struck the boat trying to swim away from them. 

Brad Hinks and his friend were fishing in shallow water near Darwin when they spotted the massive Queensland groper.

The fish, which can grown to at least 2.7 metres and more than 400kg, was so large that its scaly back broke the surface of the water.

'How's this for a groper, guys. He's a big boy,' one of the men said as they slowly approached the lurking fish.

'That is f***ing huge man.'

The fisherman were less than a metre away when the giant fish decided it was time to go.

As it frantically headed for deeper water, the groper's tail crashed into the side of the dingy causing it to nearly capsize.

The fish managed to churned up dirt from the shallow water as it high-tailed it away from the fisherman.
