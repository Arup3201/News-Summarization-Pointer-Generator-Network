Ryanair is going to great lengths to improve its image and win over customers, but it has topped a list of the ten least client-friendly airlines, according to a new consumer survey.

The list, which places British Airways joint sixth with four other major international carriers, is based on how passengers are treated when making complaints.

Raclamador.es, a Spanish consumer organisation which conducted the survey, claims Ryanair 'does not accept to resolve complaints amicably.

Ticket surcharges and a lack of assistance during delays are common complaints about Ryanair

'It always demands legal action, but does not want to see a judgement go against it, so typically settles out of court before a hearing.' 

Raclamador.es also claims that, in the vast majority of cases, the airline denies clients the right to meals and refreshments in case of delays exceeding two hours.

In addition, Ryanair has a ticket sales surcharge of €2.50 (approximately £2) each way to fund compensation in case of delays.

In a statement, Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'This survey, which was produced by a Spanish claims website, is of dubious merit when Ryanair’s traffic continues to grow strongly to 90m customers this year.'

And according to the consumer organisation, British Airways has the same policy as Lufthansa, Air France, Finnair and Alitalia, which tied for sixth.

Reclamador.es said: 'Never mediate. To summarise, the approach of these airlines would be "step on you [the client], do not answer".

British Airways finished in sixth place with four other major international carriers

'And if they do respond, it is to say that the traveller is not entitled to compensation without further explanation.'

Spain's national carrier, Iberia, is listed on the consumer website as the third most unfriendly airline.

The airline is part of International Airlines Group, which followed after its merger with British Airways.

Raclamador.es accused Iberia of setting a benchmark 'to hinder the claims process with unnecessary bureaucracy.'

It said: 'Sell tickets at a click, yet when the time comes, even just to read claims, it requires signed handwritten documents, DNI [identity cards], commute tickets, AENA complaint forms, etc. for you to receive an answer.

'Different excuses are given on the same flight to different customers, using standard templates with ambiguous content.

'When you have to go to court, many times the company acquiesces, which means that it acknowledges guilt and pays one day before the hearing.

'With this attitude, one gets delayed payment to travellers and the collapse of the Spanish system to their advantage, showing a complete lack of respect to both.'
