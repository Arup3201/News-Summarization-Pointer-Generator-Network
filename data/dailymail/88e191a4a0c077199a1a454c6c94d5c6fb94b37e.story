A father has been 'stabbed to death with a pitchfork following a row over a game of pool’ at his local pub.

Thomas Lamb, 46, was brutally attacked at his home in Restalrig Circus, Edinburgh in the early hours of Saturday morning.

It is thought he had heard intruders in his garden before he was fatally wounded and found on the street by terrified members of the public.

Mr Lamb, who was known as Tam, had been at the Tor pub in Restalrig on Friday evening where he was a regular pool player.

Police believe he may have been involved in an argument before leaving the bar. He was rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but later pronounced dead.

DCI Keith Hardie said: ‘It was a brutal, sustained and a pretty horrific attack involving significant levels of violence.

‘A couple of neighbours had obviously heard a disturbance and seen parts of an assault. One of them had gone out to the street and found him lying on the street.

‘We did recover a pitchfork from the scene and we’ll get that forensically examined.

‘Whether or not that’s involved in the attack on this individual is too early to say.’

The gruesome attack is the second tragedy to hit the family after Mr Lamb’s daughter Donna, 17, died suddenly in her sleep two years ago.

DCI Hardie added: ‘We are in touch with his family and will build up a picture of this individual. As you can imagine they [the family] are obviously traumatised because of the death of their son.

‘We will let them deal with their grief, but we will get some antecedent history around our victim and what type of individual he was.’ The gruesome attack is the second tragedy to hit the family after Mr Lamb’s daughter Donna, 17, died suddenly in her sleep two years ago.

Police are now hunting for three men that were seen in the area at around 1am and have urged anyone with information to contact them.

DCI Hardie said: 'I am satisfied, at this stage, that there has been a form of incident in the Tor public house very shortly prior to us finding a victim dead in the street - probably about 150 yards from the Tor pub. I am entirely satisfied there is a link there.

'It was particularly busy on the Friday night. We know our victim plays pool on a regular basis and he was in the pool room prior to him leaving the public house.

'I understand he was a local in the public house and a fairly quiet individual. He kept himself to himself.

'There is so much speculation that goes on and always does in this type of enquiry. Whether drug dealing was involved? It would be too early to say.'

He added that a number of witnesses have already come forward and officers are carrying out door-to-door visits at houses that look onto the scene. 

'We are keen to trace three men who were seen in the area at the time. It would appear they would have probably been in his company during the evening.

'We are appealing to witnesses from the time itself. Obviously, one o’clock in the morning is a crucial time for us when we know our victim left the pub.

'We know other people left the pub around that time as well. These are the people we are looking for us to come forward.'
