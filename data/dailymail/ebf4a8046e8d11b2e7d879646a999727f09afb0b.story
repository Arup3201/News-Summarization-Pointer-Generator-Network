A Nebraska man is being hailed a hero in China after jumping in to a river to save a woman from drowning - while other bystanders just watched and filmed the incident on their phones.

Edward Poels, who was formerly a U.S. Army captain but now lives in Shanghai with his wife and daughter, saw the woman in distress while he was on a jog near the Bund River on October 14.

The 22-year-old woman, who has not been identified, caught Poels' eye as security guards ran over to the railing to look down at her. Without any delay, he took off his shoes and socks and jumped.

The 51-year-old former Army captain explained to the Omaha World-Herald that he had learned how to safely jump from high places - including from helicopters above water - during his training.

Hero: Edward Poels, 51, pictured with his wife, is being hailed a hero after saving a drowning woman from a river in Shanghai in October. Poels, a former U.S. Army captain, grew up in Nebraska

Once in the water, he swam towards the woman and pushed her up, saying in his best Chinese: 'I help you.'

The woman grabbed onto him before falling unconscious, and together they drifted down the river. Poels spotted a rope and ladder along the river wall and moved them towards it.

Maintenance workers helped him wrap the rope around the woman and he signalled for officers above to hoist her up, with him climbing close behind.

She was placed on the sidewalk, but passersby continued to film the incident on their phones rather than offer the unconscious woman any help.

Rescue: He helped tie a rope around her and security officers hoisted her to safety, as caught on video

Safe: Once on the sidewalk, Poels pressed her diaphragm to let water out and she recovered in hospital

So Poels ran towards her and pushed on her diaphragm, causing her to cough up water. It took an hour from when she fell into the water before an ambulance arrived.

He was 
instructed by authorities to stay until emergency personnel arrived. A 
passerby gave him a dry shirt after witnesses snapped him dripping as 
she emerged from the water.

The woman was taken to hospital and she has since been released. Authorities have not said how she ended up in the river.

The rescue was widely reported in China and Poels, who remained humble about the rescue and credited the maintenance workers, said strangers congratulated him on the street.

Poels is originally from Grand 
Island, Nebraska but has lived in China since 2001, where he runs an 
export business. He and his wife, Yao Weiqing, have a six-year-old daughter, Samantha.

He credited his quick thinking to eight years worth of sailing experience, which has seen him perform around 15 water rescues, he said.

'You just learn to react and take things in sequence to keep everyone safe,' he said.
