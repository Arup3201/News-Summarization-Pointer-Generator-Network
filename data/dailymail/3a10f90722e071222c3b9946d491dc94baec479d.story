The father-in-law of the Syrian president urged him to respond to reports of torture made in a shocking Channel 4 documentary, leaked emails revealed yesterday.

Dr Fawaz Akhras, a Harley Street cardiologist who lives in London, purportedly sent President Bashar al-Assad an  email warning him about ‘horrible’ images of atrocities which were about to be aired on British television.

He suggested that the president should put out a statement saying that the torture footage would be professionally examined and those who are ‘accountable will be prosecuted’.

Hacked: Syrian president Bashar Assad and his wife Asma, whose emails were monitored by activists for several months

He is believed to have sent the email to his daughter Asmara and her husband, the president, hours before the Channel 4  documentary, called Syria’s  Torture Machine, was screened on December 19.The programme’s makers had contacted the Syrian embassy in an attempt to get an official response to the claims of mass torture they were about to screen to millions of viewers.

Aware of the damage it would do to Syria’s reputation, Dr Akhras wrote in his email: ‘The description of this video is horrible and the embassy were asked to comment but no answer.’

Dr Akhras helped draft a detailed 13-point defence of the military’s actions and suggested launching a state-sponsored English-language news network.

The email exchange appears to have been sent on to the Syrian president and his wife, so appearing to confirm the authenticity of a host of messages leaked this week.

They showed how Assad’s  British-born-wife went on  shopping sprees while her husband slaughtered thousands in their country.

Jokers: Bashar Assad may not have downloaded any Sting or The Police tracks, but it has been revealed he was 'Deeply Dippy' for Right Said Fred

Dr Akhras has been a key  liaison figure between the Syrian and British governments. He is the founder and co-chairman of the British-Syrian Society, set up in 2003. 

Yesterday Dr Akhras compared the Syrian uprising to London’s riots. 

When informed that British authorities had not killed any rioters, he replied: ‘We are not as sophisticated as the Metropolitan Police or Scotland Yard.’

An image released allegedly shows a still from footage of two dead men on the floor of a house in the Karm al-Luz neighbourhood in the restive city of Homs
