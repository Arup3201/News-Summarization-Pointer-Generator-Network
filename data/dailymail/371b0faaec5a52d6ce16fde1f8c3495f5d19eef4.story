The childhood home of Beatles guitarist George Harrison has been snapped up at auction by a super fan.

Beatles fanatic Jackie Holmes, from London, bought the Liverpool property for £156,000 at the auction which took place last night at Liverpool's Cavern Club.

The property in Upton Green, Speke was home to the musician during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years.

Seen by some as the ultimate piece of Beatles memorabilia, the three-bedroom house attracted widespread interest from fans around the world.

The house - which was home to George for 12 years until 1962 - had an initial guide price of just £100,000 and was on the market with selling agent Entwistle Green.

But its historic association with the Beatles appears to have inflated the price after it was snapped up for  £56,000 more than had first been hoped.

It is the second former Beatles home to be auctioned off recently, after a house once lived in by John Lennon sold for £480,000 last year - more than triple its asking price.

Andrew Brown, from Countrywide Property Auctions, said: 'There was interest in the property before the auction from potential buyers who lived in the UK and internationally.

'We are delighted to have sold such an iconic piece of The Beatles and Liverpool's history.'

Stephen Giddins, Regional Sales Director at Entwistle Green, said: 'We are delighted for our client and the new buyers of 25 Upton Green - it is such a unique property.' 

George was born on February 25, 1943 at his family's previous home in Wavertree.

But in 1949 his parents, Harold and Louise, moved their four children to a new council house at Upton Green.

The property was once a regular rehearsal venue for the Fab Four - but in recent years it has undergone a complete renovation. George Harrison is pictured right with band members Paul McCartney, left, John Lennon centre left, and Ringo Starr, centre right

The £156,000 that was eventually paid for the home, which has undergone refurbishment, is more than the asking price of similar properties in the area

And it was from here that George walked to the bus stop every day to catch the bus to school - and where he later met and befriended bandmate Paul McCartney.
