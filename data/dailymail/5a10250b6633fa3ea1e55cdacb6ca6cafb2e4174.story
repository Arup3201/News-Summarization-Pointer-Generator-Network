Tesco has been censured by advertising watchdogs over a price comparison campaign.

The supermarket giant claimed to be so confident it was cheaper than Asda and other rivals, that it would refund double the difference on any basket of groceries.

The scheme proved to be hugely popular with hard-pressed shoppers who found ways to take advantage of the deal.

Misleading: The supermarket giants promised to refund double the difference if rivals were cheaper - but didn't make it clear they were capping it at £20

They identified a range of products which were significantly cheaper at Asda under short-term promotions and shared the details across a raft of internet forums.

In some cases, shoppers were claiming hundreds of pounds a week in refund shopping vouchers from Tesco.

As a result, Tesco was forced into an embarrassing climbdown and announced in March that it would introduce a £20 cap on refunds.

However, the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled it failed to make this cap clear.

The ASA said: ‘We considered that the £20 limit was a significant restriction likely to affect the average consumer’s decision to shop at Tesco during the promotional period.

‘Because the restriction was not included in ads… we concluded that they were misleading.’

The details of the cap were written in to fair use smallprint of the 
promotion on the Tesco website. However, the ASA said this appeared to 
contradict the headline claim of the promotion and so was misleading.

In the bag: Tesco were forced to restrict the offer when some customers exploited the double the difference refund promotion and got hundreds of pounds in vouchers

In a ruling published today, the watchdog has ordered that the advertisements should be banned.

In its defence, Tesco said, in its view, none of the ads were misleading and the introduction of the cap did not represent a significant change.

The supermarket claimed that only a small proportion of refunds were above £20 and, consequently, very few shoppers were affected.

Tesco said the cap had been introduced to stop customers from ‘tactically shopping’ in order to take advantage of the offer in a way that disadvantaged other shoppers. 

It said the offer was intended for genuine shopping baskets but that tactical shoppers threatened its commercial viability.
