Guilty: Nurse Roger Dean, 37, has admitted killing 11 elderly residents of the nursing home where he worked

A nurse has pleaded guilty to murdering 11 elderly people by setting fire to the Sydney nursing home where he worked.

Roger Dean also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to another eight residents injured by the blaze in 2011.

The 37-year-old registered nurse was on duty when he set the fire and later appeared on television describing his efforts to rescue trapped people at the nursing home in the suburb of Quakers Hill.

He made his pleas in New South Wales state Supreme Court on Monday.

His sentencing hearing starts on Thursday. He potentially faces life imprisonment.

Police had questioned him at the home hours before the blaze over theft allegations.

He has already pleaded guilty to stealing prescription drugs from the home.

After the fire, Dean told journalists he had braved the smoke to rescue those trapped inside as the home's 88 residents were evacuated.

He said: 'I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out.'

Detectives said two fires broke out in separate wings of the nursing home in the early hours.

Dean had been helping police with their investigation before he was charged.

Speaking at the scene, NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins said fire was 'a firefighter's worst nightmare'.

He said: 'Turning up to a nursing home with elderly people who can't get themselves out of harm's way...

'Firefighters could not see their hands in front of their faces in the 
thick smoke so you can imagine what it was like for the elderly trying 
to escape.'

He said that firefighters had crawled 
into the building through the thick smoke, reaching up to feel into beds
to establish if there was anyone there who they could rescue.

Sentencing: Dean faces up to life in prison after admitting the killings

The Reverend Dave Hilliard, the senior 
state police chaplain, praised two young police officers who were among 
the first to enter the burning building and rescue residents.

'They're young and being asked to do some extraordinary things beyond their years,' he said. 'I'm blown away by them.'

There was no sprinkler system in the nursing home as they are not required under state laws.

The fire was Sydney's worst nursing home disaster since 16 elderly residents died in a blaze in suburban Sylvania Heights in 1981.
