Roberto Mancini is emerging as a leading contender to become next Italy manager.

The Azzurri have begun the search for Cesare Prandelli's replacement after the 56-year-old resigned following their early World Cup elimination.

And Sportsmail understands former Manchester City chief Mancini is in the running to take over from Prandelli.

First choice: Italian FA wish to speak with Mancini about succeeding Prandelli, who resigned on Tuesday

Unhappy: Mancini did not enjoy himself during his nine months as manager of Galatasaray

Mancini is out of work following his departure from Galatasaray earlier this summer.

And the Italian FA, at the very least, want to discuss the prospect of becoming the country's next head coach with Mancini.

The Italian had only been in charge at Galatasaray for nine months, but left with a £3.2million payoff after failing to impress.

Resignation: Prandelli, who resigned on Tuesday, ran out of ideas during Italy's poor World Cup campaign

VIDEO Fans say Prandelli must go

He led the club to the Turkish Cup but could only finish second in the league, which ultimately led to his downfall.

But Mancini coud now be handed an instant route back into the game with the Italian national team.
