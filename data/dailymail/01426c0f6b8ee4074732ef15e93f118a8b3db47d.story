Daniel Sturridge has been relaxing in Miami this week before meeting up with the England squad ahead of the World Cup. 

The Liverpool striker was named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament in Brazil and will be crucial if they are to progress into the latter stages.

And the 24-year-old, who finished his club season on Sunday, chose to have a break in Florida with his girlfriend - despite England flying over to Miami to play two friendlies in just over a fortnight's time.

Hodgson did make it abundantly clear that he didn't want players taking long-haul flights before the competition.

'If I’m not careful, I will be treating all the players like children and telling them what they can and can’t do in their spare time,' Hodgson said in February.

'But I certainly wouldn’t encourage them to go that far away, no.

'My advice will be if you are going to go away with your family, keep it much closer to home and avoid the very, very long journeys.

'But whether or not I go as far as to say "if you’ve booked a holiday to Las Vegas, then you can forget a place in my 23", I’m not sure I’ll go that far.'

England face Ecuador and Honduras over in Miami on June 4 and 7 respectively before flying to South America. 

Sturridge was also captured watching Miami Heat's 96-94 win against the Brooklyn Nets.
