Two criminals have been jailed after they robbed a delivery driver at gunpoint for a £30 takeaway.

Dale Barker, 18, and Liam Donovan, 19, ordered two mains, a naan and papadums and had it sent to a nearby address so they could steal it.

When the delivery driver arrived they held an imitation gun to his head and then took the curry home for dinner.

Cambridgeshire Police then raided Barker's home and found the two men hiding in the bathroom with the curry leftovers in another room, a court heard.

After being arrested both teenagers blamed each other for the attack.

They both pleaded guilty to robbery and having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an offence and were given custodial sentences at young offender's institutions.

Speaking after the hearing the victim, Farrukh Haque, 49, said: 'I saw one guy outside the door and he asked me: "Is that an Indian takeaway?" I said: "Yes."

'He gave me his left hand and I put the food in it. With his right hand he stuck the gun to my head.

'I was really scared. At that time I didn't know if it was a real gun or a fake gun, I just thought it was a real gun. It was dark and we were in the shadow of the trees.'

Cambridge Crown Court heard how the attackers ordered the takeaway from Dawaat Indian restaurant in Cambridge at 8.10pm on January 5.

The court heard how it was the second time Donovan had been convicted of stealing a curry at gunpoint following a similar incident in March 2012.

Barker, of Cambridge, received a lesser sentence of 28 months in a young offenders' institution, to reflect his earlier guilty plea to the attack.

Donovan, of Cambridge, received a three year sentence in a young offenders institution.

Sentencing on Friday, Judge Jonathan Haworth said it was a 'pre-planned attack conducted at night time.'

The judge told the attackers: 'You have both spent the last couple of years repeatedly appearing before the magistrates for offences of violence and dishonesty.

'You hatched a plan to order a take away, to ask for it to be delivered to an address that was not your true address, and when the waiter got to that address one of you was wearing a scarf round your head and held a pistol to his head.

'You each blamed each other for holding the pistol to the take away worker's head and you each accepted responsibility for the plan.

'This will be the first custodial sentence for both of you.'
