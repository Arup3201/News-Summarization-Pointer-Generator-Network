Former Wigan and Hull second rower Danny Tickle, who has missed only two games since joining Widnes, will be out for at least a month after being told he needs to undergo groin surgery.

The goal-kicking forward played in 30 of the Vikings' 32 league and cup matches in 2014 and has been an ever-present so far this season but will sit out Thursday's trip to Salford and will not be back until after Easter.

'Danny has been carrying the injury for the last few weeks,' Widnes coach Denis Betts said. 'It's been affecting the way he's performed.

'He's toughed it out but we need to look at him and do what's best for him.

'It's a huge blow for us because he's been fantastic for the last two years but we've been nurturing him along and now it's time to bite the bullet.'

Widnes also be without Tickle's second-row partner Danny Galea for the game against the Red Devils after he was concussed in Sunday's 20-16 win over Hull KR, while winger Patrick Ah Van is out for an indefinite period after failing to recover from a head knock.

'Patrick has got some concussion issues at the moment,' Betts said. 'We're just being really smart with him.

'He got hit on the head in a game and had a bit of delayed concussion. His symptons have kept resurfacing when he's been putting the effort into training so, under medical advice, we've had to step him back and take our time with him.

'At the moment he's in some kind of sabbatical. He's sat at home waiting for his symptons to calm down. We're monitoring him almost daily.

'When he's ready to go, he'll have to go through six or seven days of training before he's allowed to be up for selection. That's in the medical people's hands.'
