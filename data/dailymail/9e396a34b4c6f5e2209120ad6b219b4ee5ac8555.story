Funds: Napster co-founder Sean Parker is said to be looking for 'credible' political candidates to bankroll

Technology billionaire Sean Parker has turned his attention to politics and plans to donate vast sums of money to both the Republicans and Democrats, it has been claimed.

The Napster co-founder and former Facebook president, 34, is understood to have hired a team of respected political advisers to help him select 'credible' candidates to bankroll on both sides of U.S. political divide.

Parker - who was played by Justin Timberlake in the film The Social Network - is a long-term Democrat donor, but is said to want to develop a less party-based approach as his political influence increases.

According to a report in Politico, Parker has met with several senior political figures in recent months - including Kentucky Senator and 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul, and the Democrat New York Mayor Bill De Blasio.

Later this week he and other tech entrepreneurs will be co-hosting a fundraiser for California's Democrat Attorney General Kamala Harris.

Although Parker declined to comment on claims he is moving further into the political arena, Politico said they understood he has also assembled a strong team of advisers to help shape his move into the world of politics.

This reportedly includes appointing Chris Garland - the former chief of staff to California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom as his political director, and taking Addisu Demissie on as an adviser.

Demissie previously managed the 2013 election campaign for New Jersey's Democrat Senator Cory Brooker, and now runs the West Coast office of The Messina Group - the political consultation business founded by Jim Messina - Barack Obama's 2012 presidential election campaign manager.

Parker's idea to donate to both sides is believed to stem from a desire to increase voter engagement by modernising U.S. politics in general. He is said to want to ease bitter divisions that lead to voting blocks and established politicians habitually opposing their rivals, regardless of the issue at hand.

Parker's move into politics follows that of Mark Zuckerberg - the multi-billionaire Facebook founder who last year hosted fundraisers for New Jersey's Republican Governor Chris Christie, and the state's aforementioned Democrat Senator Cory Brooker.

In April last year Zuckerberg co-founded FWD.us - a lobbying group calling for immigration reform, an overhaul of the U.S. education system, and increased investment in the technology sector.

Parker's personal wealth is estimated to be around $2billion thanks to his early involvement in several highly successful tech businesses.

In 1999, at the age of 20, he co-founded Napster - the pioneering file-sharing service that has been credited with revolutionising the music industry and paving the way for the likes of iTunes and Spotify.

Although a court order shut the original Napster down in July 2001, the millions of users it acquired in its two year lifespan has led to claims it could be considered the fastest growing business of all time.

After Napster Parker founded Plaxo - an early social network that would eventually influence the likes of LinkedIn and Facebook.

Two years after founding Plaxo, Parker was ousted by the companyâ€™s financiers, Sequoia Capital and Ram Shriram, in an exit that reportedly led to the investors hiring private investigators to follow him.

In 2004 he stumbled upon a website called The Facebook via a student friend, which led to him meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, overseeing the website's development as Facebook, and eventually becoming the company's first president.

Parker has also been involved as either an investor or adviser in technology companies including Spotify, Votizen, AirTime and Willcall.
