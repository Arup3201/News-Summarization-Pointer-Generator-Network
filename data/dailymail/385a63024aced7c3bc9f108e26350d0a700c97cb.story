The cavemen and women of Dongshan are moving on - two centuries after their ancestors first made their home in these caves in China.

Soon the cave villages will be extinct and local children will only learn about the life of people who once lived there from text books.

The people who live in the village, called Kahongdong, in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have moved to subsidised housing nearer to where they work.

In recent years, nine families lived in the ten flats carved from the rock in the cave that is 50 metres deep and 60 metres high. 

But urbanisation and a desire for more creature comforts saw most of them move away.

Now only Tan Wenyan, 82, and his wife Wei Meilin, 70, live there. 

Since 2008, they have had electricity and running water as well as visitors dropping in to see what it is like living in a cave.

However, they miss their children and are now planning to join them in the big city.

'We're not lonely at all because so many people come by to see us and share the cave experience,' said Tan.  

'But it is a shame that when we are gone it will be the end of a community that has lived here for two centuries.

'People nowadays expect so much more from life and life in a cave doesn't appeal to them. But we love it.'

Since 2008, the couple have had electricity and running water and delight in having visitors drop in on them to see what it is like living in a cave

The children tried to persuade their parents to live in town but the couple declined until recently when they decided to finally make the move

The local authority has said it may consider a plan to turn the cave dwellings into a museum when the couple move out

Time to move on: Tan Wenyan, 82, and his wife have decided to move after spending their whole life living in a cave in China

All of the children except the younger son have settled down in towns.
