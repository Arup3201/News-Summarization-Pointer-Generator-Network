A mounted police officer shot and killed a dog in a Miami park after the animal started biting the legs of the horse he was riding.

According to Miami police, the officer was on patrol inside Domino Park when the dog, believed to be a stray pitbull, came up and began biting at the horse.

Witnesses say the officer pulled his mount away, but after the dog followed him around the park, he decided there was no option but to shoot the animal.

Kenia Reyes, who saw the attack, told NBC Miami: 'When the dog got here the police officer tried to avoid it by pulling the horse from the dog, but the dog followed him and began to bite the horse on the front and hind legs.

'The officer had no choice but to shoot the dog.'

Another witness, Jacroy Rivas added that the horse was kicking the dog before the officer shot it, and may have kicked it in the mouth.

She described hearing a gun shot and seeing blood on the dog before watching it walk away to die.

Police said the horse, named Sara, was taken to the Miami Police stables and had 'deep injuries to a front and hind leg.'
