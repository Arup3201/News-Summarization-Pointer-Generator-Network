An equestrian 'expert' has been banned from keeping horses, after confining her own animals in such squalid conditions that three had to be put down

Lesley Skipper, 61, is a prolific author whose works include ‘Understanding the Arabian Horse’ and ‘Realise Your Horses’ True Potential’.

But she and her husband Brian, 56, appeared in Darlington Magistrates’ Court charged with four counts of causing unnecessary suffering to their horses and two charges of failing to ensure the animals’ welfare.

Neglect: Lesley Skipper, 61, has been banned from keeping horses after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her animals

RSPCA inspector Garry Palmer visited the couple’s stables in Middleton St George, near Darlington, on June 14 2011 after The British Horse Society raised the alarm.

He said: 'When I turned up on the day I thought offences had been committed as did the vet and our independent prosecutions department.'

The investigation found that two of the horses at the stables were suffering from the foot disease laminitis, while another had severe dental problems.

Suffering: A grey stallion had been so neglected it was put down immediately

Squalid: The accumulation of litter meant the horses' heads were nearly touching the ceilings of their stables

An accumulation of dirty litter meant the horses’ heads were almost touching the roof of their stables.

A grey stallion, called ‘Nivalis’, had to be put down at the scene.

Two other horses were signed over to the RSPCA - an Arab cross mare and a grey mare - and both were put down on veterinary advice.

A fourth horse, an Arab cross stallion named Jaz, hasn’t been signed over by the couple but is currently in RSPCA care. It has had to undergo six months of treatment on its hooves.

The Skippers pleaded not guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an adult female Arab cross by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis, and to causing unnecessary suffering to a grey stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis.

Prolific: Lesley Skipper has written a number of books on horses. Her latest, 'Understanding the Arabian Horse' was written during the period the RSPCA say the neglect took place - between 14 May and 14 June 2011.

They were also charged with causing unnecessary suffering to an Arab cross stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for overgrown hooves, and with causing unnecessary suffering to a grey mare by failing to seek appropriate veterinary care to address dental problems.

The couple also pleaded not guilty to failing to meet the needs of the four horses by not ensuring their need for a suitable environment and failing to meet their needs by failing to protect them from pain, suffering, injury and disease.

The Skippers, of Durham Road, Stockton-on-Tees, were found guilty of all the charges which took place between 14 May and 14 June 2011 following a four day trial.

Their solicitor, Ann Marie Gregory, argued that any ban on keeping animals should relate only to horses because there was no evidence that the couple had ever neglected their other animals.

She said: 'These people are in their late fifties, early sixties and there is no suggestion that they have neglected any other animals.

'They have dogs and cats at home, I ask that they can keep the dogs and cats bearing in mind it is the first offence and bearing in mind the difficulties they have had.'

Put to sleep: A grey mare called Roxzella (pictured) was put down because of dental problems

The court had previously heard that Mr Skipper suffers from bipolar and post-traumatic stress disorder and that the pair were suffering from flu when the bedding became too difficult to clear out by hand.

Presiding magistrate Les Abbott banned them from keeping horses indefinitely and imposed a deprivation order in favour of the RSPCA, meaning that a fourth horse will stay under the charity’s care.

The couple were also ordered to pay £250 each towards court costs.

Pain: Bay Arab cross Imzadi (pictured) also had to be put down, so advanced was its chronic foot disease

Speaking after the sentence, RSPCA inspector Ruth Coxon said: 'We are really pleased with the sentencing, we strove for a ban, that is what we took them to court for and that is what we have got.

'The fact that it is an indefinite ban is really good news to protect animals from suffering in their hands in future.'

RSPCA inspector Garry Palmer said: 'These are people who are supposed to know how to care for horses, so it is even more unacceptable that they left these animals in such poor conditions.

'By banning the defendants from keeping horses the court has recognised how important it is that no other animals are made to endure the same fate.'
