Pope Francis has said he is 'truly sorry' for offending  large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'.

The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'.

Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu has apologised on Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'.

Anger: Francis caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'

Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.'

Francis, himself the eldest of five children, had told a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines how a woman he knows was pregnant with her eighth child after having the first seven by C-section.

He said he had rebuked her, saying: 'But do you want to leave seven orphans?'

The Pope said: 'That is an irresponsibility. [That woman might say] 'no but I trust in God.' But God gives you methods to be responsible.' 

He added: 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.'

The remarks immediately provoked anger from pro-life groups who said that they were hurtful to Catholic mothers who had sacrificed careers, time and energy to care for their children.

Former US Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a devout Catholic, said: 'It's sometimes very difficult to listen to the Pope and some of the things he says off the cuff, and this is one of them.'

The following Wednesday, Pope Francis attempted to repair some of the damage, telling his general audience in St Peter's Square: 'It gives me consolation and hope to see so many large families that welcome children as a true gift from God.'
