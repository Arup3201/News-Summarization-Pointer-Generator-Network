Accused: Emma Beach, 25, above, denied one charge of assault and one charge of theft

The grandaughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs appeared before a crown court judge accused of stealing money and assaulting a woman.

Emma Beach denied the theft of £150 pounds and assaulting Samantha Hallam on July 29 this year.

The 25-year-old stood in the dock at Guildford Crown Court and only spoke to confirm her name and answer 'not guilty' when the two charges were put to her.

Her mother Karen Briggs, the daughter of the popular Coronation Street actor who spent 30 years playing factory owner and playboy Mike Baldwin, sat in the public gallery to support her daughter.

Beach, stood in the dock wearing a black Parka-style coat and with her hair scraped into a tight ponytail.

She was released on bail by Judge Peter Moss with the conditions that she observed a curfew requiring her to stay at an address in Hamilton Avenue, Cobham, Surrey, and does not contact Miss Hallam.

She was ordered to return to Guildford Crown Court for trial on December 9.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
