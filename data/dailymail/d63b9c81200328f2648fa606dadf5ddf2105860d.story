Tony Mowbray will be named as the new manager of Coventry on Tuesday.

Mowbray has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in 2013 but has agreed to return to the dugout with the League One strugglers.

Steven Pressley was sacked by the Sky Blues last week after a run of seven games without a win. 

Former Middlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray will take over as the new boss of struggling Coventry 

Neil MacFarlane and Dave Hockaday took charge of Saturday’s win over MK Dons and look set to remain in charge for Tuesday’s game at Barnsley but Mowbray could be in the stands at Oakwell.

Coventry are just above the relegation zone after their poor run of form and will look to Mowbray to turn things around quickly.
