A drugs smuggler linked to an international network which used specially adapted clothing to smuggle heroin has been jailed for 16 years.

Tahir Mahmood, 53, was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five drug-related offences at an earlier hearing.

Judge James Burbidge QC also jailed his 'right-hand man', Anwar Bashir, 43, for 15 years. Bashir, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of three offences.

Jailed: Anwar Bashir (left) was sentenced to 15 years and Tahir Mahmood (right) was sentenced to 16 years. They were linked to an international drug trafficking network which used adapted clothing to smuggle heroin

Smugglers: A body suit that was worn by a drug mule linked to the two men. The suit, which was worn under clothes, is made up of a series of concealed compartments in which drugs could be stored

Concealed: Packets of heroin were tied into concealed pockets lining a specially-designed body suit. On one occasion a drug mule was picked up wearing a body suit that contained 87 packets of heroin

The court heard how the group smuggled large quantities of heroin from Pakistan into the UK using a network that passed through Dubai and a number of European countries.

They used sophisticated concealed compartments and pockets within suitcases, books and specially-adapted clothing to hide heroin from customs officials.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said 
Mahmood, of Stourbridge, West Midlands, was in charge of multiple 
couriers - people who traffic drugs - based in Spain.

Prosecutor Timothy Hannam told the court that Mahmood played a 'leading role - directing and leading on a commercial scale' with the aim of 'substantial financial gain' while Bashir was his 'right-hand man'.

The court heard the offences took place between September 2011 and January 2012. The network’s activities spanned the UK, to the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain, Dubai and Pakistan.

On one 
occasion, Mahmood and Bashir met a drugs mule at Birmingham Airport who 
was wearing a body suit stuffed with heroin under his clothes. The body 
suit contained 87 packages of heroin, the court heard.

CCTV
 footage captured Bashir and Mahmood putting him into a taxi at the 
airport. The taxi was later stopped by police and the man was arrested.

Specially-crafted: The men also used suitcases with hidden compartments to traffic drugs. The network's activities spanned the globe - from the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain to Dubai and Pakistan

On another occasion, heroin was found in a concealed compartment in a suitcase taken off a carousel at Birmingham Airport.

Mahmood admitted three counts of assisting or inducing the commission of an offence abroad and two counts of trafficking.

Bashir was convicted of two counts of assisting or inducing the commission of an offence abroad, and one count of trafficking.

Sentencing
 the pair today, the Judge Burbidge said: 'When heroin is placed on the 
streets of Europe and England it creates misery to many. You wanted to 
make money out of that. That was your aim.'

Deception: The network used books like this one that had been hollowed out to conceal heroin from customs officials. Sentencing the pair, the judge said the drug 'creates misery to many'

He added: 'You both expected substantial financial gain.'

NCA Branch Commander Paul Risby said: 'We proved Mahmood and Bashir were linked to seizures totalling 46 kilos but I believe the network dismantled could have been responsible for many more importations - bringing misery, harm and violence to communities in Birmingham, Bradford and other cities.

'Tackling the supply of drugs on a global level and protecting our borders are priorities for the NCA and its partners.

'These two men are now behind bars where they belong.'

Five couriers linked to the gang were prosecuted separately and received sentences ranging from five to 12 years.

The NCA operation was supported by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Organised Crime Division, West Midlands Police, the Spanish Guardia Civil and other international law enforcement agencies.
