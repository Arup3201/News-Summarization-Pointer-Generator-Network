The alleged party pal of Prince Harry
-  who claimed they had a 'naked drunken fumble' in Las Vegas - has been 
arrested for writing bad checks as she tried to board a plane to Mexico.

Carrie Lynn Reichert, 40, from San 
Diego, has been wanted in Harrison County, Mississippi, for writing
checks totaling $21,672 starting in August 2003, according to 
the New York Daily News.

A source told the paper: 'Customs matched her up at the airport. She was fixing to go out of the country, but we had 
them snatch her up. She didn’t get to go on her little weekend 
adventure.

'How stupid can you be? You know you’ve got warrants on bad checks 
you’ve written. After 9/11, you know we’re checking everyone on every 
flight.'

Detention: The San Diego jail where Carrie Reichert is being held in custody after being arrested for writing bad checks

The 40-year-old gave a tell-all 
interview to The People newspaper after pictures of a naked Harry were 
published on celebrity gossip site TMZ.

She claimed she and the prince were alone in his hotel room for up to 20 minutes, during which time  she stripped down to a string bikini and claims Harry was completely naked.

However, despite the intimate nature 
of their rendezvous, Carrie insisted their kiss was 'fun' and 'not 
romantic'.

She also claimed that, in spite of many people stripping off 
at the party, it was not an orgy.

Instead, she said, Harry was a 'gentleman' but added he was completely 'wasted'.

She is now being held in a California detention center where she is listed as being 5-feet 7-inches tall, 120 pounds and 40-years-old. She told The People she was 32.

A St James’s Palace spokesman flatly denied the girl’s claims.

The spa-owner,
who had been visiting from San Diego with a group of girlfriends, 
claims she was hand-picked to join the Prince's party after his friends 
spotted her near the swimming pool at the Encore At Wynn hotel, it was 
reported.

The British-born 
beauty said she was approached by one of the Prince's entourage who 
invited her to party with them in his penthouse.

She told The People: 'I'm not going to pass an opportunity to party with Prince Harry.'

When she got upstairs, she said, the party was in 'full swing' with guests - and Harry - already naked.

She added: 'Harry was already 
undressed. It was just crazy, he looked actually delirious. There was a 
pool table and he was playing air guitar with pool sticks.'

Carrie said Harry took her by the hand and led her from the living room to his bedroom soon after introducing herself to him.

Harry was already naked and she removed her dress to reveal a string bikini before she kissed him, she said.

The pair then had a conversation about her childhood links with Britain before enjoying a 'drunken fumble'.

She
added: 'We kissed for 15 to 20 minutes. I am sure someone stumbled in 
as there were people going in and out of rooms all the time. We kissed 
again and he said "That was great".'

Speaking out: The 40-year-old is the first woman to speak out about Harry's wild night in Vegas, where he was pictured frolicking naked with a young woman during a game of 'strip billiards'

Carrie said they then both rejoined the party in the living room and carried on drinking until she went back to her hotel room.

Harry was photographed on a mobile 
phone in just a necklace with a naked female playmate hiding behind him 
having played a game of strip pool in his VIP Las Vegas suite.

Another 
showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug, which have 
since been seen by tens of millions across the world.

As well as the embarrassment, it did raise security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip.

Despite Met sources saying that there
was no security breach and that officers were not there to protect his 
reputation, it is believed two of  Harry’s most high-ranking personal 
protection officers have already been interviewed by their bosses back 
in London.

They were accused of watching him 
being photographed playing ‘strip billiards’ in his Las Vegas hotel 
suite but failed to take any action.
