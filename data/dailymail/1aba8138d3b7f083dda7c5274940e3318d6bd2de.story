A New Zealand woman can cross streaking off her bucket list after getting her kit off at an All Blacks test match and dashing across the field to slap a player on the backside before getting tackled to the ground by security.

Rose Kupa, 25, decided to disrobe and a make a run for it during a Mexican wave at the game on Saturday night where the Kiwi team smashed Argentina - 28-9 - in Napier on the southern part of the North Island.

The unexpected cheeky entertainment included player Israel Dagg receiving a slap on the bum which he just laughed off but Kupa admitted she was actually aiming for his team mate Richie McCaw at the time.

Kupa got away without being charged but may received a trespass notice from council

Ms Kupa said the nudie run had been on her bucket list and admitted she got off 'quite lightly' after police decided not to charge her for the incident. 

'I was expecting to take a harsher rap,' she told tvnz.

Police opted not to charge the woman but council spokeswoman Robyn McLean said it was 'quite likely' a trespass notice would be served,  stuff.co.nz reported

Hawke's Bay area commander Inspector Tania Kura described the streak as merely a '30 second' blip in an otherwise well-behaved 22,000-strong crowd.

'I actually think that the consequence for the young lady is waking up today reflecting on everything,' Inspector Kura said.

All Blacks coach Steve Hansen labelled the antic as 'a pain in the backside' and questioned security measures needed to be addressed to prevent punters getting on the field. 

'They do really good tackles at the end of it, but they probably should do some before they get on - that would be handy.'

Napier Mayor Bill Dalton was also not impressed with the naked disruption at McLean Park which had not hosted an All Blacks test since 1996.

'I just think it's absolutely, terribly disappointing that one girl can bring the entire security arrangements into question. It's just a shame she didn't have more brains,' he said.
