Landing a delicate rover on a hostile planet can be tricky at the best of times.

But what if you could bounce the rover on the surface, in a similar way to dropping a ball, without having to worry about damage?

That’s what Vytas SunSpiral and Adrian Agogino at Nasa Ames Research Center are attempting to find out through their design of a shape-shifting robotic exoskeleton, dubbed the Super Ball Bot.

Nasa is designing a flexible, deformable robotic exoskeleton to land on alien planets. This spherical structure might be able to land without assistance, absorbing most of the shock of impact itself

The Super Ball Bot’s spherical structure can land without any help, absorbing the shock of impact and saving weight that would otherwise be taken up by parachutes and impact balloons.

It can also use its ball-like structure to roll around without wheels once on the surface, propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components.

These same cables can be used to pull back parts of the robot, so that science instruments at the centre may be exposed and used.

The robot could be collapsed to a very compact configuration for launch. Once it reaches Titan, it would open and drop to the surface.

The Super Ball Bot’s spherical 
structure can land without any help, absorbing most of the shock of 
impact and saving weight needed for more complex landing gear. 

It can use this same ball-like structure to roll around 
without wheels, propelling itself forward by shortening and lengthening the cables that connect its rigid components.

These same cables could be used to pull back parts of the robot, so that science instruments at the centre could be used.

The design is a radical departure from the rovers currently in service, such as Curiosity, which use more traditional rigid robots.

The Super Ball Bot, however, relies on something known as ‘tensegrity’ which means it’s composed entirely of interlocking rods and cables.

Nasa describes tensegrities as counter-intuitive tension structures with no rigid connections but which are ‘uniquely robust, light-weight, and deployable’.

There is no single point of failure in a tensegrity robot and no axles or hinges have to be strengthened. Instead, the force of an impact is diffused over multiple areas on the robot.

These unusual structures are hard to control traditionally so researchers are experimenting with controlling them using machine learning algorithms and neuroscience inspired controls known as ‘Central Pattern Generators’.

Mr Agogino told Rachel Courtlands of IEEE Spectrum that that they'd have to invent new ways to handle controls so the robot will move smoothly and efficiently.

‘This is so new that if you can do anything more than a twitching dead thing you’re really ahead of the curve,’ he said.

The design could be used for a potential mission to Saturn's moon Titan. Swince the robot collapses into a smaller shape, scientists could pack a number of units into one spacecraft and study more of the moon's surface.

The space agency believes a Super Ball Bot could fall from more than 62 miles above Titan without being damaged.

Any interplanetary expedition is still years away, but the team has been awarded a grant from Nasa to continue their work.

Ideally teams of dozens or even hundreds of small, collapsible robots, weighing only a few kilograms a piece, will be conveniently packed during launch and would reliably separate and unpack at their destination
