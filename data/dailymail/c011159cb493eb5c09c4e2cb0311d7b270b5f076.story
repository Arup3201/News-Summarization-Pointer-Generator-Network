Improvements: Korean Air economy class was praised for its clean cabins and generous legroom

Meanwhile, most improvement came from Korean Air, which suffered a series of tragic crashes in the 1990s.

In the last ten years, management changes and practices have led to the carrier being rated highly according to the collected data, with passengers being impressed by clean cabins and generous legroom. 

Japanese airline All Nippon Airways and South Korean Asiana Airlines also faired well in the list.
