Secrets: If the walls could talk this mansion could share the honeymoon secrets of John F. Kennedy as well as describe playing host to the infamous 'horse's head' moment in The Godfather

Romantic getaway: President John F. Kennedy and his new bride, Jacklyn, spent their honeymoon in this palatial Los Angeles retreat

Luxury lifestyle: The living room has 22-foot high ceilings and wall-to-wall bookcases

Billiards, anyone? The game room features herringbone parquet floors and its own fireplace

Film fame: In the Italian mafia film The Godfather Jack Woltz, the movie producer had a horse head put in his bed - the scene was filmed at Beverly House

It is also on sale for $115 million - the hefty price-tag might sound ultra-expensive but it is snip compared to the $165 million it was advertised for in 2007.

Alongside playing host to a newlywed President in 1953, Beverly House was also used for a number of scenes in The Godfather.

The house has also provided a backdrop for  Whitney Houston's hit film The Bodyguard and Steve Martin film The Jerk.

Boasting 70,000sq ft of interior space, the airy mansion includes a 50-foot entry hall with loggia, living room with 22-foot high arched ceilings, and a library.

It has a whopping 29 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, night club, cinema and a billiards room containing herringbone parquet floors and a massive carved stone fireplace mantle from San Simeon.

Glamorous: President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier were married in September 1953, after JFK was elected US Senator. He was 36. She, just 24 at the time of their wedding

Grand wedding: The Kennedys were married at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Newport, Rhode Island as part of a massive ceremony with more than 800 guests

The house was built in 1925 by English born architect Gordon Kaufman, the man best known for his work on the Hoover Dam.

It was bought by banker Milton Getz but its most famous owner was publishing giant William Randolph Hearst.

The
media mogul was given the property as a gift by US actress Marion 
Davies in 1946, with his 'mistress' paying just $120,000 for the 
mansion.

Built out of 
terra-cotta stucco, the H-shaped residence combines Spanish and Italian 
style. It has intricately carved ceilings and panelled walls, French 
doors, balconies, arched ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, which 
overlook cascading waterfalls to the pool and the Venetian columns 
beyond the pool house.

Steep discount: The $95 million asking price is as steal compared to the $165 million price tag on the home when it was put on the market in 2007

Historic: The home was built in 1925 by architect Gordon Kaufman, who is best known for his work on the Hoover Dam

Bargain: William Randolph Hearst received the home as a gift from one of his mistresses, who paid just William Randolph Hearst $120,000 for it in 1946

Staggering: The Beverly House has 29 bedrooms, 40 bathrooms, a nightclub, a cinema and a living room with 22-foot ceilings

Outside, the property boasts 3.7-acres of landscaped gardens, and includes a 75-foot long swimming pool, two tennis courts and a sit-down dining area for up to 400.

When it went up for sale in 2007 itÂ  became the most expensive residential property listing in the U.S.

It surpassed the $135 million being 
sought for the Aspen, Colorado, estate being sold by Saudi Prince Bandar
bin Sultan, and the $125 million developer Donald Trump is seeking for a
beachfront estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
