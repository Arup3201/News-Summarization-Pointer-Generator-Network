A baby born prematurely in New York leaving his parents fearing a £130,000 medical bill has flown home in style after the couple's insurance company and private donations covered the costs of his early arrival.

Dax Lee Johnston spent seven weeks in the city after his unexpected arrival weighing just 3lbs while his parents were enjoying a four-day getaway after Christmas.

Katie Amos and fiancé Lee Johnston, both 30, welcomed Dax on December 28 after she went into labour 11 weeks early while sightseeing in the Big Apple.

Baby Dax, born prematurely in New York leaving his parents fearing a £130,000 medical bill, has flown home

Parents Katie Amos and Lee Johnston, both 30, flew Dax home from New York in his own private medical jet

The little boy needed his own passport and to be well enough to make the journey before he could be given the all-clear to fly home in his very own private medical jet. 

His mother described his journey home to the UK yesterday as like a 'military operation'.

Miss Amos, from Burgh-le-Marsh in Lincolnshire, said: 'When we were finally given the all-clear to come home I broke down in tears, we were so happy, no words could describe it.

'What had been a very slow process, all of a sudden changed and everything happened really quickly.

'It was like all of our New Years wishes had come true all at once.

'We were originally told that Dax wouldn't be well enough to make the journey home until earliest March 10, which was his original due date.'

She added: 'As Dax was premature he wasn't allowed to fly on a commercial airline, the only reason we are home now is because we had a specially equipped aircraft and Dax had his own incubator.'

Dax was given the all-clear to travel from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York on Thursday.

His parents were told Pilgrim Hospital, in Lincolnshire, had space for Dax - but Miss Amos added they had a 24-hour window to get him home in case other patients were booked in.  

She said: 'On Friday evening we were transferred to the airport with Dax in the incubator.

'We had our own private plane with just us, the pilots, a team of doctors and nurses - it was like a military operation.

'We had to stop off to re-fuel twice in America before flying over the Atlantic and making a final stop in Iceland.

'We have been on such an emotional journey and it's so amazing to be back in the UK with all our friends and family.'

Miss Amos and Mr Johnston were stunned when their son arrived almost three months early while they enjoyed a last-minute holiday. 

She said: 'We had been trying to cram as much in as we could in our four day trip.

'We were on the Central Park movie tour when I started getting sharp pains, I knew something was wrong, but I kept dismissing it. 

'I don't know how but we managed to finish the tour, I just knew I needed to rest, but when we made it back to the hotel we phoned a doctor who told us to get to a hospital straight away.

'I was examined and nearly passed out when the nurses told me I was four centimeters dilated and Dax was on his way.'

Miss Amos added: 'We have cried, laughed and felt everything in between, it's been a really tough journey and we are over the moon that it's finally over.

'When we finally received Dax's American passport it was a huge milestone, we could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

'To get a UK passport it could've taken up to three months and we wanted to get him home as soon as we could, so Dax has a US passport and birth certificate.

'Just to get the photo we had to remove all of his vital tubes that helped him breathe and feed - it was really scary.

'Being born so prematurely Dax has had a few health scares but he's doing really well now.'

She added: 'He has reflux which is common for premature babies as his little body had so much to contend with.

'He's still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) which means one of the main arteries from his heart isn't closed properly.

'It's looking positive though as doctors say this should close on it's own.

'Dax has been incredible throughout, he's our little fighter and we are so proud of him already.'

And after giving birth, the couple were shocked to discover they could be left with a £130,000 medical bill - but now their insurers, Allianz, have confirmed they will cover all costs.

'When we arrived at the hospital, one of the nurses asked Lee to sort out our medical insurance,' Miss Amos added.

'When he came back he was grey in the face - the woman he had spoken to said she wouldn't accept our insurance, it was so scary.

'The prices were sky high. We were horrified when we started adding up the cost of everything which would've amounted to around £130,000.

'What made it worse was it was the holidays so everywhere was closed, we thought for nearly a week that we would be left to pay this on our own.'

The couple, who are both fitness instructors, travelled to New York on Boxing Day for a last-minute holiday before the birth of their baby.

But two days into the trip, Miss Amos went into labour and Dax was born.

Mr Johnston said: 'The timing wasn't the best, but I guess Dax couldn't wait any longer.

'We couldn't be more thankful to our family and friends who have kept us strong even when we have been miles apart.'

And now the couple's financial worries are now over - thanks to their insurance company and donations.

Mr Johnston added: 'We want to express our gratitude to Allianz for their tremendous help, as well as all the kind strangers who have donated nearly £12,000 to help my family.

'Without this money I don't know what we would've done. It went towards living costs as we had only taken four days worth of clothes, plus food and all of the vital things Dax needed.'

He added all donations on Dax's fundraising page are now going to Ronald McDonald House.

Mr Johnston said: 'The organisation provides vital help and cheaper accommodation for families, just like myself and Katie whose children are in hospital.'

He added: 'The final step of the journey for Dax will be to get big enough and well enough to return to his own home.'

Miss Amos said: 'So many people have pulled together to help us get our little boy home - we will never forget it.

'The next step of our new life with Dax can finally begin, we couldn't be more happy.'
