A masked man ran into a hotel in Northern Ireland last night, throwing a firebomb at the reception desk and telling staff they had 30 minutes to escape.

The bomb detonated, damaging the reception area of the Everglades Hotel in the Prehen area of Londonderry but lives were saved by staff and police organising a mass evacuation just in time, police said.

A flare-up of violence in Northern Ireland had been anticipated a month ago after Gerry Adams was arrested by police in connection with the murder of Jean McConville in 1972.

Today, Northern Ireland’s new chief constable in-waiting vowed to bring to justice to the dissident republicans he held responsible for the attack.

George Hamilton, appointed to the high-profile role yesterday, said: 'I think the fact it has happened indicates some of the challenges that face us.

'These are people who are opposed to peace, they are people who are trying to use violence, who are damaging the economic well-being of the country, who are taking jobs off people and they don’t actually care about this place or about the citizens of it.  I do, deeply.

'We will be doing everything in our power possible to prevent occurrences like that and when they do occur we will be doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice.'

A holdall containing the fire bomb was hurled into the reception area of the four-star hotel in the Prehen area of the city shortly after 11pm last night by a masked man claiming to be from the IRA.

Witness Gary Rutherford said he had just dropped off relatives at the hotel entrance when a man covering his face with a mask and hood ran past him, tossed a bag containing the bomb at the reception desk, and warned they had 30 minutes to escape.

'Someone set off the fire alarm and I called the police. It was quite confusing at the time for most of the guests because they were in bed. It was mayhem,' said Rutherford, whose family was staying at the hotel in preparation for a relative's funeral today.

Police 
praised the efforts of hotel staff and Police Service Northern Ireland 
(PSNI) officers on the scene for evacuating guests before the bomb went 
off.

A PSNI spokeswoman said: 'Their actions have undoubtedly helped to prevent a tragedy.'

Hotel guests were found alternative accommodation in the city.

Foyle MP Mark Durkan said: 'People of Derry won’t see this as an attack against a particular site but an attack against the whole city.

'So many people are working hard to move the city forward, but those behind this device are trying to drag us all back to worse times.

'The nature of the device, and the manner of this reckless attack, show that they are a threat to anyone and everyone. That is why we must be united and strong in rejecting their ways.'
