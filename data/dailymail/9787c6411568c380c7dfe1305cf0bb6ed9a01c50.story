It has been five years since Claudia Lawrence went missing

Detectives investigating Claudia Lawrence's disappearance have found DNA on a cigarette butt in her car which could lead them to a mystery 'left-handed smoker'.

The revelation is one of several new disclosures from a cold case review that will fuel speculation the 35-year-old chef could have been seeing a secret boyfriend in the weeks before she vanished five years ago today.

Using techniques not available in 2009, police found the potentially vital DNA profile on a discarded Embassy Regal cigarette butt.

It was found in the ashtray of her Vauxhall Corsa, which was being repaired when she went missing.

They want to find out if the evidence from the car, which had been off the road ‘for a number of weeks’ when she vanished, is linked to a man who has been dubbed the 'left-handed smoker'.

The man was seen 
standing with a woman at 5.35am on the day Miss Lawrence disappeared, at a point on her 
route to work and at an appropriate time.

The
 couple were seen by a passing cyclist and were facing each other 
several feet apart on Melrosegate Bridge. The man, dressed in a dark 
hooded top, was smoking from a cigarette held in his left hand.

Miss Lawrence was ‘comfortable’ with people smoking in her car and home, police said, and officers have been checking the DNA of male smokers known to have sat in her vehicle without finding a match.

Police also want to trace a man who told shop workers he knew Miss Lawrence or used to work with her, but has never been traced.

The man, identified on CCTV, mentioned the case to staff in Tang Hall, York, on April 1, 2009 - almost two weeks after she disappeared.

The charity Crimestoppers today renewed a £10,000 reward for any information which leads to the arrest and conviction of someone responsible for Miss Lawrence's disappearance.

It is the fifth time the reward has been offered and it will be valid for the next three months.

A cigarette butt found in Miss Lawrence's car, which was being repaired when she disappeared, is being reexamined

Witness: This man in a Co-Op in Tang Hall, York, said he knew Claudia on April 1, 2009. He was never traced

Analysis of Miss Lawrence's phone 
records indicate she was spending an unusual amount of time 
‘socialising’ in the Acomb suburb of York during this period and police 
believe somebody she was seeing there is ‘yet to come forward.’

Evidence
 inside Miss Lawrence’s house indicates she left as normal early in the 
morning of Thursday 19 March to walk the three miles to work at the 
University of York’s Goodricke College for a 6am shift.

Another more curious item police want to trace is Miss Lawrence’s set of GHD hair straighteners.

Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, who is leading the review, said officers had spent two months examining her terraced house.

He said: 'From the review of all the evidence available, including the fact that Claudia's bed was made and it appears that she had eaten breakfast and brushed her teeth, it is our belief that she had left for work on the morning of Thursday 19 March 2009.

'What is unusual is that Claudia's GHD hair straighteners - model number 14.4.1B and purchased in May 2007 - were missing from her home.

Police are investigating how and why Miss Lawrence's GHD hair straighteners could have disappeared

Peter Lawrence, right, the father of Claudia, left, described the uncertainty surrounding the case as 'a cancer'

'From our inquiries, it is doubtful 
that she would take them to work in her blue and grey Karrimor bag which
 has also never been found.'

Mr Malyn said extra fingerprints and DNA material were found throughout the house and work on this was ‘ongoing.’

He
 added: ‘We are keen to eliminate people who have been inside Claudia’s 
home before and after her disappearance. The elimination process is 
simple, we just encourage people to come forward. Not doing so only 
raises questions as to why you wouldn’t.’

Anniversary: There is a £10,000 reward for information which leads to a conviction

Mr
 Malyn is to take part in a 5th anniversary appeal on the BBC’s 
Crimewatch programme tonight. The show is expected to feature new 
details of two vehicles seen at the time of her disappearance, but 
police have refused to discuss this information before broadcast.

Police have also released photos of hair dye bottles found in Miss Lawrence's house.

Officers said Miss Lawrence regularly used hair dye to highlight her naturally brown hair and they found a significant quantity of it in the house.

Det Supt Malyn added: ‘There is a possibility that Claudia may also have been colouring another person's hair. If anyone knows about this or it was you, please come forward now.’

The
 high-profile police inquiry has always focused on Miss Lawrence’s 
private life and her parents have been upset by reports about her 
lovers.

Police have previously revealed at the time she went missing she was in a secret ‘long term casual relationship’ with a man who was in a serious relationship himself.

She also went out with a different 
mystery man 48 hours before she vanished. Miss Lawrence arrived for her 
early shift looking tired and told a work colleague she had been out 
until 4 or 5am with a boyfriend.

Miss
 Lawrence was a prolific user of her mobile phone and further ‘cell site
 activity’ analysis showed she was often in Acomb during her spare time 
in the weeks before she disappeared.

Although
 known to drink in a pub there, police believe there could be vital 
information about this aspect of her social life that they have not been
 told about.

Mr
 Malyn said: ‘We have spoken to people in the Acomb area and I still 
think there may be somebody over in Acomb who is yet to come forward or 
give us the full information we require.’

Hair dye: Police have released photos of hair dye bottles and believe Miss Lawrence may have been dying someone else's hair before she disappeared

Dye: Some of the products found in Miss Lawrence's house. She was also believed to dye her own hair

Evidence: More of the hair dye products in the chef's home. More fingerprints were found in the house

Miss Lawrence’s silver Samsung D900 mobile has never turned up. It went dead at 12.10pm on the day she went missing. Police said yesterday they don’t think it ran out of battery power and believe ‘it was deliberately turned off by someone.’

When police were called in they found Miss Lawrence’s bed made and dirty breakfast dishes in the kitchen sink.

Mr Malyn said police ‘favour the theory’ she set off for work as planned with her mobile and rucksack containing her chef’s whites.

He said it was ‘doubtful’ she would take the straighteners to work but they ‘could be crucial to the investigation.’

His colleague Chief Superintendent Simon Mason told a press conference there is ‘not a prime suspect and nor is there any individual who could be deemed to be classified as suspect status.’

But he added: ‘There are a number of individuals who remain and are of particular interest to this investigation.’

Speaking earlier Peter Lawrence, the missing woman’s father, said waiting five years for news was ‘like a cancer.’

‘It gets worse and worse and of course there is no resolution until we know what happened to Claudia.’
