News reporters are accustomed to members of the public finding the lure of a television camera irresistible, but one New York journalist's heckler was no ordinary camera-struck citizen.

As Pix11 reporter Mario Diaz reported on Shia LaBoeuf's latest antics in Midtown Manhattan on Friday singer Erykah Badu, wearing a huge hat and a cheeky grin, began edging into the frame.

She paced back and forth behind Diaz, opening her coat to reveal her colorful outfit before making some obscene hand gestures.

Next, she approached Diaz and tried to lay a kiss on him - but the reporter managed to fend her off before continuing his live cross.

He explained to the anchor back in the studio that he 'couldn't avoid a fan right now.'

Eagle-eyed viewers noticed the video-bomber bore a striking resemblance to the Grammy award-winning singer and put the question to her on Twitter.

'Nope,' she responded, before eventually coming clean with another tweet.

'Sorry Mario,' she tweeted at the reporter.

He responded with some Prince lyrics (I just want your extra time and your... kiss), and promised to be more amenable to strangers' advances in future.

'Next time I won't do the NYC push back,' he wrote, adding that his wife thinks Badu has 'great taste.'

Apart from messing with TV reporters, Badu has had a busy weekend in the city, performing with Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall on Friday and a Brooklyn block party in honor of the 25th anniversary of Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing.
