Around half of young  Britons who are out of work and not studying full-time have never even had a job, a study revealed yesterday.

The Institute for Public Policy Research estimates there are  640,000 16- to 24-year-old Neets (Not in Education, Employment or Training).

This comes at a time when there are 529,000 job vacancies, up 56,000 in a year, and raises fears there are now vast numbers of unemployed who have never learnt the basic work ethic needed to get a job.

Spencer Thompson, an economic analyst at the IPPR, a Left-wing think-tank, said: ‘We know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people.

They need people who turn up on time, look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview.’

A separate report, from the  British Chambers of Commerce, also reveals how many bosses are ‘disheartened, if not downright frustrated’ by school leavers.

John Longworth, of the business lobby group, said the education system was letting down young people.

He added: ‘Businesses I speak to up and down the country want to work with young people and are happy to train and employ them.

‘But
they are often disheartened if not downright frustrated to find school 
leavers and graduates do not have the minimum skills they need to join 
the workforce.

‘The most common problems include poor literacy and numeracy, and behaviour and attitudes that don’t meet business expectations.’

Examples include having no idea how to make a telephone call, such as having a polite telephone manner, failing to dress appropriately and a lack of punctuality.

Other common faults include  having the wrong manner at work, such as being ‘too matey’ with  senior executives, or simply not even turning up for a job interview.

Mr Longworth said: ‘The Government must stop fixating on exam results alone and ensure that soft workplace skills are taught in our school. If not, young people will continue to be left out in the cold.’

Despite the large number of young people who are not working, official figures show the number of job vacancies has reached the highest level since the end of 2008.

The IPPR said many youngsters struggle to get jobs if they have never worked, a problem which is particularly acute if they have few qualifications.

One in three young people with less than five GCSEs with grades between A* and C and no experience of work are unemployed, compared to only one in six who have work experience.

Mr Thompson: ‘A lot of families are better off than they used to be and there is less reason for young people to go out and get part time jobs. There is also been an intangible cultural change.

‘More people are going to university and there’s more emphasis on academic study over the work side of things.’

He added: ‘Very few employers take account of young people with no experience of the workplace.

‘Young people who haven’t had exposure to work are disadvantaged in the recruitment process even for quite low level jobs. The kind of jobs that are available are mostly customer-facing.

‘In the old days, you could stick a young apprentice at the back of the factory. But when you are talking about customer facing jobs in supermarkets or service industries, you have to have some social skills.’

The IPPR said the number of out of work young people who have never worked – 640,000 – is only just below the number who have worked at some point – 650,000.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are reducing bureaucracy so it is easy for employers to offer work experience.

‘In addition, our new Traineeship programme will make sure young people are work-ready. Changes to college funding mean they will now be paid for the time students spend on work experience.’
