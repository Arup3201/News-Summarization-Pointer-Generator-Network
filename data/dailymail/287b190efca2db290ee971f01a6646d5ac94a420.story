A pair of suicide bombers detonated themselves near two churches in Lahore today, killing 15 and leaving nearly 80 people wounded. 

In the tense aftermath, an angry mob quickly turned violent, blocking a major highway, burning cars, ransacking a bus terminal and setting two people suspected of involvement in the attacks on fire.

Twin blasts went off minutes apart at the Saint John Catholic church and Christ Church in the city's Youhanabad area on Sunday morning.

A spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, Zaeem Qadri, condemned the attacks but said it was unfortunate the mob had killed the two suspects rather than turning them over to police. 

He added authorities are reinforcing security at the 481 remaining churches across the city. 

Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a Pakistani Taliban splinter group, claimed responsibility for the blasts and said it was the work of two suicide bombers.

The Pakistani Taliban  vowed to continue their campaign for the enforcement of Sharia law.

Area hospitals were flooded with casualties and scenes of mourning.

Shaheen Bibi's 10-year-old son Abhishak was among those killed. Two police officers who were protecting the church were also killed in the explosions.

'My son had gone to the church to pray for a good result in his examinations,' Ms Bibi said as she cried.

'He wanted me to sew him some new clothes if he passed his examinations.'

One witness told Pakistan's Geo television that the main gate to one of the churches targeted was closed so people were using a smaller gate.

'One bomber exploded himself near that gate, that created chaos and during the course there was another blast,' he said.

In the tense aftermath, the mood quickly turned violent. 

Local television footage showed an angry crowd beating a person they thought was connected to the attack, while others attacked buses in the city.  

The blasts, in a majority Christian suburb of the eastern city, went off in quick succession at a busy time when worshippers were attending Sunday morning prayers. 

Pastor David, a local cleric at the site, said: 'One blast took place at the entrance of one church where a congregation was going on. 

'Another blast took place in the second church,' adding that the two buildings were 500 metres (1,600 feet) apart.  

Witnesses reported that quick action by a security guard prevented many more deaths - but the guard is also among those dead.

Amir Masih told Reuters that he saw a man trying to enter the church, who then blew himself up.

He said: 'I was sitting at a shop near the church when a blast jolted the area. 

'I rushed towards the spot and saw the security guard scuffle with a man who was trying to enter the church, after failing, he blew himself up.

'I saw his body parts flying through the air.'  

Mr Masih said the security guard died in the blast, but did not know if the first blast was also a suicide bomber. 

Nabila Ghazanfar, a spokeswoman for the police, told AFP that a state of emergency has been imposed in the city's hospitals as the death toll was expected to rise.  

Meanwhile, hundreds of Christians took to the streets to protest against the police and the lack of proper security at the churches. 

Militants in Pakistan have attacked Christians and other religious minorities many times over the years.

Much of the country is on edge after an attack on a Peshawar school in December last year killed 150 people - mostly students.

And in 2013, 80 people were killed and more than 100 others wounded after twin suicide attacks were carried out at the All Saint's Church in Peshawar, in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on the country's Christians. 

But Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, is generally considered peaceful.

However, violence there has been increasing after the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the Taliban last year.

After these failed, the military launched an offensive in the remote northwestern region of North Waziristan along the Afghan border to push the Taliban from the last major region they controlled. 

Lahore is the capital of Punjab, Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province as well as the political heartland of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who criticised the attack.

A statement carried by state media said: 'Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif ed the Lahore blasts and directed provincial governments to ensure the security of public and their properties.'

Pope Francis also condemned the attacks, departing from his scripted remarks in his customary address today to decry the 'persecution' of Christians.

He told crowds at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican that he prayed for peace in the country and that 'this persecution of Christians, and that the world tries to hide it, finishes'.

'These are Christian churches. Christians are persecuted, our brothers spill their blood simply because they are Christians,' he added.
