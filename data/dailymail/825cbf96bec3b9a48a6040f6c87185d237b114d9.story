A drunk thug killed a charity worker with a pair of scissors just three weeks after being freed early from prison for beating another man with a baseball bat, a court heard yesterday.

Shaun Lacey, 40, of Leek, Staffordshire, had a 23-year history of violence - but was granted parole after serving half of a three-year jail term for battering a man at random.

Just 21 days after his early release from jail, Lacey became drunk and stabbed his mother’s neighbour Damien Fyson, 37, in the chest with a pair of kitchen scissors as the victim lay asleep.

Before fleeing the scene, Lacey told a horrified onlooker: ‘I’ve stabbed him in the heart, you better get an ambulance.’

Mr Fyson, who used to a work for an organisation which handed out donated furniture to the poor and needy, suffered fatal injuries and bled to death at the scene.

Lacey - who has 18 previous convictions for violence dating back more than 20 years - was jailed for 17 and a half years after admitting manslaughter.

Two years ago he was branded a ‘violent bully who uses violence as an acceptable means of dealing with minor irritations’ by a judge.

But despite his record, Lacey was released on December 18, 2013 after serving only 18 months.

The killing occurred on January 8 this 
year after Lacey went to his mother’s home in Hanley, near 
Stoke-on-Trent, to help get her back into her flat after she was locked 
out.

Birmingham Crown Court was told he had 
been drinking all day and encountered Mr Fyson who lived next door with a
 woman called Tina Brown.

Shaun Lacey had 18 previous convictions for violence dating back to 1991 when he was arrested for causing actual bodily harm.

In 1994 and 1996 he was convicted of wounding and common assault, for which he was jailed for one month.

In
 1997, Lacey was handed six months imprisonment for common assault but 
went on to commit another common assault in 2002. In 2004, he was jailed
 for battery for 18 months.

Four
 years later, in 2008, Lacey committed three further offences of 
assault, and in 2009, he was arrested for threatening behaviour, and two
 counts of assault, including an attack on a policeman.

In
 2011, he was convicted of assaulting a pub landlord and assaulting his 
ex-partner - who was 40 weeks pregnant at the time - before he hit 
neighbour Gavin Ball over the head with a baseball bat. In July 2012 he was jailed for three years.

The pair invited Lacey into their flat and the group shared drinks but tragedy struck at 5am when Miss Brown, who had fallen asleep, woke up to see Lacey stood up in front of her holding a pair of scissors and saying he had stabbed Mr Fyson.

She called paramedics but they were unable to save the victim.

Prosecutor Gareth Evans QC said: ‘The defendant has a lengthy record for unprovoked violence. His convictions can range from young people, women, old friends - he doesn’t discriminate over who his victims are.

‘He was on prison licence and within a matter of days he was killing someone. His violence is escalating. He uses his fists and his teeth to harm people.

‘He has used a baseball bat to hit someone over the head and now he has used a pair of scissors. He had been at liberty a matter of weeks when this incident occurred.’

Lacey claimed he was not looking for trouble. But the judge Mr Justice Stephen Phillips told him: ‘This was an appalling act of mindless violence fuelled by incessant drinking.

‘There’s no doubt you knew what you had done because you told someone to call an ambulance and left the flat. The tragic result of your actions was the loss of Damien’s life. Mr Fyson’s mother and sister have been left devastated by their loss.’

Forensics on location: Lacey was jailed for 17 and a half years after admitting manslaughter in court

After the case Detective Inspector Dave Johnston, of Staffordshire Police, who led the inquiry, said: ‘Our investigation to establish the facts of this tragic incident was difficult due to the fact those involved had been drinking heavily.

‘However, by piecing together the detailed forensic evidence from the scene and the evidence given by witnesses, we were able to confirm that Lacey had been responsible for Damien’s death.

'This was an appalling act of mindless violence fuelled by incessant drinking'

Mr Justice Stephen Phillips

‘It was noted by the judge that his actions had no apparent motive and were simply fuelled by excessive alcohol.

‘We welcome today’s guilty plea and I hope that this conclusion brings some form of comfort to Damien’s family.

‘Although Lacey’s admission to manslaughter will not bring Damien back, his family now at least have the knowledge that his killer is facing justice and will be spending considerable time behind bars.’

Mr Fyson’s mother, Cherie Jackson, said: ‘No sentence can bring Damien back to us, however, we would like to thank the judge and prosecution for seeing Lacey for what he is, a cruel and heartless killer, and passing such a long sentence.’
