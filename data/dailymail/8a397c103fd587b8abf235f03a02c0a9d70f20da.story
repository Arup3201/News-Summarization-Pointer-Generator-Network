One of al-Qaeda's most senior militants has been killed in a U.S. drone strike over Yemen, the group claims.

Harith al-Nadhari - who threatened more attacks on France after the Charlie Hebdo killings - died on January 31 along with three other militants in a car in Shabwa province, southern Yemen, al-Qaeda said on Twitter.

The group named the other slain militants as Said Bafaraj, Abdelsamie al-Haddaa and Azzam al-Hadrami.

Killed? Al-Qaeda claims a U.S. drone strike over Yemen on January 31 has killed senior militant Harith al-Nadhari, who threatened more attacks on France after the Charlie Hebdo killings

Al-Nadhari, who claimed to be the group's spiritual leader, said in a video on January 10: 'It is better for you to stop your aggression against the Muslims, so perhaps you will live safely. If you refuse but to wage war, then wait for the glad tiding.'

The strike, first reported by Yemeni tribal and security officials, was the second such strike in five days as Washington pledges to continue fighting the militants despite Yemen's political paralysis.

Last year, al-Nadhari provoked a clash between al-Qaeda and its splinter group the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (commonly known as ISIS).

He publicly condemned the extremist faction - which has been disowned by al-Qaeda - for 'driving a wedge' among jihadi groups.

He referred to the group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's recent call for followers to 'explode volcanos of jihad everywhere.'

Al-Nadhari said ISIS 'forced the nation, all the nation, to pledge allegiance' in absence of 'consultation' with other Jihadi leaders.

His message was posted on one of Yemeni Al-Qaida's official Twitter pages.

He said: 'They revoked the legitimacy of all the Islamic groups across the Islamic world .... and drove a wedge among Mujahedeen ranks by collecting allegiances from within the Jihadi groups.

'They announced the expansion of their caliphate in a number of countries in which they have no mandate.'
