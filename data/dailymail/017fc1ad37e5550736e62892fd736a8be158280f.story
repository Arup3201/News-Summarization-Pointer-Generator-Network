A snake made its way into a Texas golf hole last week. Maybe it just wanted to practice its backswing. 

On Friday, March 13, the groundskeeper at the Deerwood Club in Kingwood, Texas tweeted a photo of a snake he spotted hiding in a golf hole.

Ed Martinez tweeted the photo of the snake found in the 12th hole at the Club with its head sticking through the bottom of the cup, AL reports.

Martinez wrote: 'Yep not changing this cup today!!' and included the hashtag #hatesnakes.

It's not clear what kind of snake was in the cup - but  a tweet on Martinez indicates that club officials pulled it out of the hole safely.

The snake is not the first reptile to make its way onto a golf course, scaring people in the process.

Safe: The species of the snake has not been made public, but a tweet on Martinez's Twitter account indicates that Club (photographed) officials pulled the reptile out of the hole safely

Last week a giant alligator was spotted on the green at a Florida golf club. A photo of the gator circulated and many thought the image was photo-shopped, ABC reports. 

The Myakka Pines Golf Club has taken advantage of the attention its received since the gator wandered onto its golf course.

Myakka officials have named the mystery gator 'Goliath' and have even created 3-D models of the animal.
