Qantas is set to unveil a new campaign in a heart-felt advertisement, which centres around real people returning home to their loved ones in a bid to boost customer loyalty and rebuild its brand.

It comes after the national carrier announced its major overhaul, which included 5000 job cuts, ditch unprofitable international routes, cuts to its aircraft maintenance budget and suffering its massive loss of $2.8 billion.

The ‘Feels like home’ series tells the real stories of five Qantas passengers going on their journey home to Australia and being welcomed at the airport by their families and friends.

Filmed in London, Santiago, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, the Pilbara and Sydney, the campaign features Qantas employees and customers and will hit the screens and social media from Sunday 9 November.

Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said the campaign was designed to celebrate the unique place Qantas has in the lives of many Australians.

‘For almost 100 years Qantas has been bringing Australians from all around the world home to the people and places they love,’ said Mr Joyce.

‘We often hear that seeing the Qantas red tail at an airport, or stepping on board a Qantas aircraft, makes Australians feel like they’re halfway home already. That’s the spirit we wanted to capture.

‘The stories we’re telling through this campaign are repeated everyday across our network. They reflect the special pull of home, the love of family and friends and the way Qantas helps bring Australians together around the country and around the globe,’ added Mr Joyce.

The two-minute campaign shows a young woman making an emotional return to Sydney after a year in London; a miner coming home to his family after a long stint in the Pilbara; a little girl coming home from Los Angeles after the trip of her lifetime visiting extended family; a mother living in Hong Kong bringing their new baby home to excited grandparents for the first time; and a young backpacker making his way back from South America.

The Feels Like Home campaign will be seen on television, cinema, outdoor, in print and online.

In launching the campaign, Mr Joyce said now was the right time to invest in reinforcing what makes Qantas special.

‘This campaign celebrates the hard work of our people, the trust and loyalty of our customers and the pride we all feel in the national carrier,’ Mr Joyce added.

Qantas launched the ad on its official Facebook page on Friday and has received a significant amount of positive feedback and almost 75,000 views

Following the announcement in February, the Flying Kangaroo slashed jobs from its 33,000 strong workforce, including 1500 roles from management and back-office staff.

In the most dramatic overhaul Qantas has had in nearly 20 years, the airline also ditched its route between Perth and Singapore, affecting travellers to and from Australia.
