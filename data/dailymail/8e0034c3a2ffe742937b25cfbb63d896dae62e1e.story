Police have appealed for help from the public to identify a man who was pulled near death from a shark-infested harbour by two teenage girls.

The pair have been hailed as heroes after risking their own lives to jump into shark-infested waters where a man was drowning.

Cousins Kelly McKay, 15, and Payge Olds, 16, were helping their friend tow his car near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night when they heard a man scream for help.

Without thinking, the group rushed 300m down the beach to the scene where Payge managed to undress the fastest and swim 70 metres out to sea to rescue the  man.

'We all thought it was a prank at first because this kind of thing doesn't really happen,' Payge, from Lower Hutt in Wellington told Daily Mail Australia. 

The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek,  who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it.

He saw the man floating face down in the water unconscious.

Mr Derek, who was unable to swim, alerted the group to the man in the water, with the hope that one of them would be a capable swimmer.

'I was the last one there and everyone else was undressed and ready to jump in the water but no one had jumped in yet because none of them are comfortable swimmers so I ended up just stripping off to my underwear and then jumping in,' Payge said. 

The two teenagers were helping their friend tow his car after it got stuck on the beach 

The incident happened near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night

Payge said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 

'I wasn't expecting to get that far,' she said of the distance she swam out to sea. 

'At the time I didn't really think about it. I just thought you know what there's a man out there suffering, I need to get to him and help him.

'Now I'm really proud of myself and I'm happy that I was there.' 

Police released images of the man unconscious and lying in his hospital bed an appealed for public help to identify him

The man appeared to be aged in his 30s and from a South Asian background 

Police said the man was dressed but had no identificatoin on him, The Dominion Post reported.

'Unfortunately, due to his condition, police has been unable to speak with him and he was not carrying any identification that could help us find out who he is,' Detective Sergeant Grant Corroll said, appealing for anyone who recognises him to contact police.

'Given his critical stauts, time is of the essence,' he said.

Even the murky water and it's inhabitants didn't stop the courageous teenager from jumping head-first into the harbour.

'There's eels and multiple other things in there,' she said. 

'Sometimes we do get sharks and whales  and stingrays but I didn't really think about that. Well I did but I tried to avoid that thought.'

Two men, who were sitting on the rocks on the harbours edge, shone torches on the water so Payge would be able to see where she was going. 

The teenager said she was terrified she would be too late and that she would lose the man in the dark. 

'My worst fear was that he wasn't there any more and that I was just too late,' she said. 

The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it

'Eventually I came across him and he was kind of floating. He was sinking but he was just on the surface.

'If I has been any longer I would have completely lost him and I would not have been able to find him.'

According to Payge, the man had an Indian appearance and weighed between 70 and 80kg. She said both her and her cousin thought he was in his late 30s to early 40s. 

'I got there and I couldn't lift him, he was so much bigger than me,' Payge said. 

Payge  began to panic and started screaming for someone to help her.

After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay(right) began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over

17-year-old Logan Mason and a 25-year-old man swam out to Payge and assisted her in bringing the man back to shore.  

'I got his feet out of the water but then I had to yell and get all the manly men to come and help me because I couldn't do it myself,' she said. 

After eight minutes, the group got the man back to shore and 15-year-old Kelly McKay began performing CPR until paramedics arrived and took over.

'My cousin Kelly did CPR she did so good. We're really proud of each other,' Payge said. 

'I don't consider myself a hero, I just consider myself human because it's pretty much what anyone would do I thought.'

Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded

Senior Sergeant Andre Kowalczyk of New Zealand Police said that the actions of the two girls is to be applauded.

'They did an excellent job in very difficult circumstances and their efforts to enter the water to save this man's life were exceptional,' Sergeant Kowalczyk said. 

The man was taken to Hutt Hospital, where he is in intensive care in a stable condition.

He is described as a male Indian approximately mid twenties to mid thirties. He was wearing a Maroon colour short sleeved polo shirt and a pair of black light-weight trousers. 

The man was not carrying any form of ID on him.

According to Payge, Police found a pair of runners and a hoodie on the beach but it is not clear whether they belonged to the man or if there was another person in the water.  

'I just really want to meet him and hug him and just understand why he was out there,' Payge said.
