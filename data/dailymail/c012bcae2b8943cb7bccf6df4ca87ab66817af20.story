They were guests at the royal wedding and count the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among their closest friends.

But the connections were not much use when TV adventurer Ben Fogle and his wife ordered birthday decorations from the Middleton family firm, Party Pieces.

The company failed to deliver items in time for Ludo Fogle’s fifth birthday celebration and could only manage a lacklustre apology when his mother confronted them about the ‘disappointing’ service.

Complaint: Marina Fogle, pictured with husband Ben, tweeted about her anger over the Middleton's family firm, Party Pieces, failing to deliver items in time for Ludo Fogle’s fifth birthday

Marina Fogle, whose sister once dated Prince William, was so unimpressed that she took to Twitter to vent her anger.

‘Really disappointing service from @PartyPieces [who] failed to deliver for Ludo’s party, didn’t tell me and can “only apologise”. Not good enough,’ she wrote.

Within half an hour staff had tweeted a grovelling reply and sent a gift in the post.

The Party Pieces message read: ‘@FogleMarina Apologies again, we understand our customer services manager has refunded you and is sending a small gift by way of apology.’ But there was no reply from Mrs Fogle, a former party planner and caterer, who organised a children’s party at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s 80th birthday.

The failed delivery did not seem to ruin Ludo’s big day. His father posted a picture on Twitter of him blowing out his birthday cake candles with his mother.

Party Pieces is owned by the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents who started it in 1987. It is worth an estimated £30million.

Their daughter Pippa works for the business and is part-time editor of its blog, The Party Times, while son James sells his cake-making kits through the website.

Miss Middleton helped organise the celebration after the royal wedding and was said to have put noses out of joint with her introduction of glitter balls in the throne room.

Mr Fogle, 41, became close to Prince William after his wife introduced them.

The couple attended the royal wedding in 2011 and were among the 300 close friends at the evening party at Buckingham Palace. ‘I met [William] many years ago,’ Mr Fogle has said. ‘I feel very comfortable around him. There are many things we have in common … Marina’s family know William. It’s how I got to know him and I’ve seen how loyal everyone is around him.’

Mrs Fogle’s sister, Olivia Hunt, dated Prince William during his first year at St Andrews. Their romance fizzled out when Kate Middleton came on the scene but Miss Hunt is still friends with the royal couple and has skied with them in Klosters.

While at Edinburgh University, Mrs Fogle began a catering business with a friend. They later founded party planning firm Kasimira, which is recommended on Party Pieces’ website. Party Pieces did not respond to requests for comment last night.
