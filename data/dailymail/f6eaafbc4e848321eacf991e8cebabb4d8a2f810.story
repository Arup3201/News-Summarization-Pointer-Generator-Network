Fifty-six minutes gone at Wembley, a Peru move breaks down and Gary Cahill brings the ball out of defence. He gives the ball to Jordan Henderson, on to Steven Gerrard, and then Wayne Rooney virtually on the centre spot receives it. He’s on the half turn looking to get forward but is quickly closed down so lays it back to Cahill, and offers himself again.

Adam Lallana gives him the ball, Rooney moves forward and taps it back to Lallana who runs into the space Rooney created. Again the Manchester United man wants it back, but Lallana’s pass is careless and Peru take up possession. There is a real threat because Glen Johnson is miles up the pitch. As England lost the ball he stood and watched and then decided to trot back.

Rooney sees the danger straightaway and as Yotun passes out to the left to Ramirez, he sprints into the right back position and launches a perfectly timed tackle to snuff out the danger.

Quiet night: Wayne Rooney struggled in front of goal against Peru but still put in a committed performance

Frustrated figure: Rooney was deployed behind Daniel Sturridge as Roy Hodgson persisted with a 4-2-3-1 formation

That tackle happened right in front of where I was sitting with my son watching the game and it had to be perfectly timed. Get that one slightly wrong and it’s a yellow card. If that happens at a World Cup, it could prove costly.

As the ball hit the advertising hoardings Johnson sauntered into the penalty area.

Now I can’t say Rooney had a great game. Going forward it just didn’t happen for him at all. And a great tackle won’t save him from another disappointing World Cup if he doesn’t create and score for England in Brazil.

But what I want to see from England players, even when they’re not playing well, is commitment, and that tackle showed why people are so wrong to call for Rooney to be dropped.

When I read Mick Channon describing Rooney as the 'weak link' on Sportsmail last week I was shocked. The former Manchester City and Southampton striker is right that Rooney hasn’t delivered at a World Cup, but he’s only the weak link if he offers less than the rest.

At his best Rooney is a hard-working goalscorer and a creator. At his worst he is a team player.

Rooney doesn’t deserve the criticism. He has earned the right with performances and goals for his club and country for us all to debate how to get the best out of him, rather than lazily writing him off.

The problem Rooney has is that because he is so good at everything, his true strength is overlooked. He is a goalscorer – a goal machine.

Check out how brilliant Rooney was in the 2011-12 Premier League season for Manchester United. He scored 34 goals in 43 games, back-to-back Premier League hat-tricks, the first when he was man of the match in United’s record-breaking 8-2 demolition of Arsenal. He was an out-and-out striker at that point. 

A change of position, playing a deeper role, has led to some doubting his United credentials.

Rested: Rooney is replaced by Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling after 66 minutes on Friday night

Danger man: Daniel Sturridge continued his good form with a stunning strike against Peru

Familiar sight: Sturridge has become England's main goal threat after a standout season for Liverpool

Same with England – he is well on the way to breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record. But in the 4-2-3-1, he plays behind lone striker and has become less of a goal threat.

England have two fantastic centre forwards in Daniel Sturridge and Rooney, play them both up front, put a diamond behind them – with Gerrard deep, Raheem Sterling at the point, James Milner or Henderson on one side and Lallana on the other, and you have a better chance of getting the very best out of Rooney who let’s not forget is, on his day, England’s best player.

Problem is he doesn’t have enough of those days and he hasn’t had any of them at a World Cup. Yet.

The 28-year-old needs to be played further forward if he's to find his best form at the World Cup
