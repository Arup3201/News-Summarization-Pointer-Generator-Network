A young Scottish author whose inspirational book has helped children deal with their parents’ cancer diagnosis is to receive an award set up in memory of Princess Diana.

Teenager Emma Sutherland, 14, beat off youngsters from across the country to scoop a Diana Award in the active campaigner category for her debut book ‘Eek! My Mummy Has Breast Cancer’.

The book is Emma’s personal story about coming to terms with her mother Rosie’s illness.

The Diana Awards were established in 1999 - two years after her death - to celebrate children who help their community.

Emma, from Fairmilehead in south Edinburgh, said she had no idea about the award until organisers told her she had won.

The Boroughmuir High School pupil yesterday said: 'I didn’t even know I had been nominated so I was a bit confused. It took a few minutes to sink in.

'I’m too young to remember Princess Diana but I’ve heard about her and what she did. I was just telling my mum that One Direction’s song Diana was inspired by the princess.

'It’s great to have an award in Diana’s memory.'

Emma penned her story after struggling to find advice for children her age while her mother was battling illness.

When the internet failed to give her any answers she decided to create her own book, which was published last year after a family fundraising drive for printing costs.

And it has proved to be popular, with a second print run already ordered.

Emma - a big One Direction fan - said: 'It’s nearly two years since I wrote the book and really weird to see where they have all ended up.

'There’s people from all over the world that have been looking at the Facebook page so it’s good to know we’re raising awareness.'

Her mother, who has now been given the all-clear, said her daughter had taken the praise in her stride.

Rosie, who works as a child minder, said: 'I’m really proud of her.

'Emma’s enjoying it and is certainly going to be a true campaigner in her young adult years.'

Fundraising and helping others is clearly in the Sutherland family’s DNA as they have spent years raising money for the special care babies unit at Edinburgh’s Royal Infirmary.

Emma herself was born prematurely at just 3lb 7oz and spent her first three weeks in the unit.

She decided to pay back staff in the Simpsons unit by donating the proceeds from cake bakes and yard sales.

Emma was nominated for the Diana Award by charity boss John Macaulay of Fight Against Cancer Edinburgh, who also took her to Lapland last Christmas.

He said: 'It’s just great what she’s doing and I thought she deserved the recognition for it.  It is brilliant that she has won a top award which will be signed by the Prime Minister.'

A spokesman for Maggie’s Cancer Care, which provided counselling for Emma, said the award was a 'significant measure' of the importance of her book for other children.

All of the proceeds from Emma’s books go to Maggie’s Cancer Care and every Maggie’s Centre in the UK has a copy along with every Edinburgh Library.

Last month Emma also scooped A Young Scot Award for her writing. A total of 40,000 Diana Awards have been handed out to inspirational youngsters so far.

Award winner: The book is Emma's personal story about coming to terms with her mum Rosie's illness. The Diana Awards were established in 1999 - two years after her death - to celebrate children who help their community
