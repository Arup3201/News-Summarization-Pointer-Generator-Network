Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has said she feared that her head would explode after her agonising facial reconstruction surgery went drastically wrong.

Maloney, 61, who is around 18 months into her transition period to change gender, reportedly suffered internal bleeding and required emergency surgery after she had a reaction to the operation at a Belgian clinic.

She had undergone the operation two weeks ago to make her face appear more feminine, but instead her face ballooned to twice its normal size and she almost stopped breathing.

Twice-married Maloney, who as boxing promoter Frank helped Lennox Lewis to become world heavyweight champion, says her eyes were bleeding, and she resembled Frankenstein's Monster after the surgery in Antwerp.

She was in intensive care for four days after the operation, and needed specialist equipment to help her to breathe. 

'I just felt my head inflating like a balloon. It was getting bigger and bigger by the second, I could hardly see. I feared it was going to explode,' she told the Sunday Mirror's Matthew Drake.

Maloney, who has three children, has been hooked up to a tube to drain the excess fluid from her head, and worries about what her face will look like once the swelling has subsided.

'It was as if I had gone ten rounds with Mike Tyson in his pomp and another ten with Lennox Lewis for good measure,' she said, but says doctors are confident that she will make a full recovery and will be pleased with the final results.

Maloney, who announced earlier this year that she was now living as a woman, has already undergone hormone therapy, electrolysis to remove excess body hair, counselling and voice coaching.

But it is thought that Asprin tablets she has taken to thin her blood after suffering a heart attack stopped her surgery wounds from healing properly, which sparked the complications and bleeding. 

He face began to swell up after the seven-hour surgery, and within a few hours was struggling to speak or breath, forcing doctors to operate in order to save her life. 

She has been warned that her blood is low on platelets, and must endure regular visits to doctors to ensure she is recovering properly but has been allowed to leave the Belgian hospital and is back home in Maidstone, Kent, with her family.

However, Maloney said she is still determined to have the final operation to become a woman, and is set to have a breast augmentation operation and gender reassignment surgery in February at a private clinic.  

'It’s not just a matter of wanting to go through with this. This is something I have to do to correct what was wrong at birth,' she said in a second interview with the Daily Mirror. 

She said although doctors have told her the complications from her facial surgery have put her around two months behind schedule, this will have no effect on her suitability for surgery.

Maloney also rubbished claims her operation had been cancelled because of a reported risk to her heart, and said she is excited for her final surgery.

But she said that other transexuals should be given more advice before having their operations. 

'It ­probably was vanity that drove me to have so much work done, but there is not enough ­independent advice ­available and too many people travel abroad to have work done in ­environments that they are not familiar with,' she said.

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery.

Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change. 

In August this year Maloney shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman, having retired from the sport in October 2013.

Ahead of her surgery, Kellie told Lorraine Kelly that she wanted to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said. 

'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.'

She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly.

'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.'

Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people.

She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too.

'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked.

MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.
