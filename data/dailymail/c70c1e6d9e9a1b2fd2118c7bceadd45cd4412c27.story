'The failure to detect a fracture on an X-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in A&E,' says Michael Kelly, an orthopaedic trauma surgeon

Shirley Johnstone had mixed feelings when the A&E doctor said the X-ray of her elbow showed no sign of a fracture.

‘It was a relief there was no serious damage. But I was in agony — I couldn’t move or straighten my arm, and felt I needed more than just paracetamol and a few days off work,’ recalls Shirley, 60, a chef from Great Wakering in Essex.

The pain had begun suddenly when she stretched up to adjust a showerhead.

‘At first I thought I’d slept on my arm badly,’ she says. ‘But it was so painful, my partner advised me to get it checked.’

Six days after she was seen at A&E, Shirley received a phone call from the hospital. Doctors had reviewed the X-ray and there was a fracture after all, in the olecranon, the protruding bone that forms the tip of the elbow.

It was a mistake that, four years on, is still affecting Shirley’s life.

For a second X-ray showed that the fractured bone fragments had moved 4mm in the intervening days. Her arm was put in a cast, then a week later she had surgery to pin the bone in place.

But a year after the operation she developed a painful infection because fluid had built up around the fracture. And three years later she still gets pain in the joint, especially in cold weather. ‘I had to have so much time off work, I was demoted and put on a lower wage,’ she says. ‘I’ve never got back on track.’

Shirley has never had a proper explanation for the delay in spotting the fracture. ‘One doctor told me, “I’m afraid sometimes these things get missed”,’ she says.

Every year one person in 100 in the UK breaks a bone, and about half the 20 million or so visits to A&E involve having an X-ray, mostly to check for bone injury. But research suggests that thousands of patients walk out of A&E with doctors having failed to spot their fracture.

‘Numerous studies have shown that failure to detect a fracture on an X-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in A&E,’ says Michael Kelly, consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust.

And if a broken bone is not stabilised quickly, the impact can be devastating.

‘At the very least, people suffer prolonged pain and inconvenience,’ says Mr Kelly, ‘but it can also lead to ‘chronic functional limitation with long-term pain, early symptoms of osteoarthritis or a stiff joint.’

The bone may also fail to fuse and need complex surgery later. So why does it happen?

Ordering the correct X-ray, then detecting an abnormality on the image takes skill and experience. Yet A&E patients are most likely to be seen by junior doctors, with new doctors ‘fresh from medical school being the most senior staff working at evenings and weekends in one in five A&E departments’, according to a study by the College of Emergency Medicine.

‘You can identify a major fracture of a large long bone across the room,’ says Mr Kelly. ‘But more subtle injuries require a systematic approach that comes with experience.’

About half the 20 million or so visits to A&E involve having an X-ray, mostly to check for bone injury

A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2002 showed that junior doctors in A&E miss up to 39 per cent of ‘clinically significant abnormalities’ on X-rays.

This is why many, but not all, hospitals have introduced a safety net: all X-rays should be reviewed by a specialist — either a radiologist (a clinician specialising in interpreting scan images) or a specially trained radiographer, whose main job is taking X-rays.

This can make a big difference. A study at North Tyneside General found that people whose fractures were reviewed only by an A&E doctor were ten times more likely to be wrongly given the all-clear.

And patients whose X-rays were checked by a specialist before they left A&E were three times less likely to have a missed fracture, according to a 2013 study by the University of Bradford School of Health Studies. However, there is currently no time-based target for specialist reviews, which can be postponed for weeks. A recent audit of missed fractures and abnormalities at one London hospital revealed that, at worst, it took 48 days before X-rays were reviewed.

Meanwhile, a survey of a quarter of NHS radiology departments last year revealed it had taken more than 30 days before over 80,000 X-rays were reviewed by a radiologist. ‘This suggests that nationally about 300,000 patients are waiting more than a month for their X-rays to be analysed,’ says Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists.

This means the NHS also picks up a substantial bill for surgery and other treatments that would have been avoided if fractures were detected earlier.

Yet observers have noted an increase in missed fractures.

Rebecca Campbell, a clinical negligence solicitor at Slater and Gordon, says the firm has seen a rise in cases of patients misdiagnosed with sprains and soft-tissue injuries, only to be later diagnosed with fractures that could be clearly seen in the first radiology images.

‘As a result, the patients have had a delay in treatment, often resulting in the fractures becoming worse,’ she says.

Certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed in X-rays

Certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed.

‘Hairline fractures, where the bone is broken but not misaligned, appear as a fine line on an X-ray which can be overlooked,’ says Dr Adrian Boyle, emergency medicine consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge. ‘Or the bone may be hidden — this commonly happens with fractures to the scaphoid bone, one of the smallest in the wrist and the one most likely to break.’

Guidelines issued by the College of Emergency Medicine recommend that patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture and tenderness in the wrist area should be offered a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan even if the X-ray comes back clear.

This year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is due to issue wider guidelines on the diagnosis of fractures in emergency departments.

Like Shirley Johnstone, Jacqui Hunt suffered after a fracture was missed in A&E. The former nurse, now 57, broke her wrist after tripping on the steps of her London home in August 2013. At A&E she was told that the X-ray showed a broken bone in her right wrist, and her arm was put in a cast.

‘I went home expecting it to gradually get better but it didn’t,’ she says. ‘I was in such agony I couldn’t even brush my hair.’

Two months later, when the cast was removed, a further X-ray showed a second fracture — she had also broken the ulna bone (which enables the wrist to rotate), but it had been missed. She needed specialist surgery and she was put on a waiting list for several months. While she was still recovering, Jacqui lost her job.

People who walk out of surgery with an undiagnosed fracture may not seem obvious victims, but their lives can still be blighted, says Richard Evans, chief executive of the Society of Radiographers.

‘We should be working towards a system where every patient has his or her X-ray reviewed before being discharged from A&E. The evidence shows how powerful this would be.

‘If a medication had the kind of impact this simple change in procedure has, every hospital in the country would have to provide it.’
