Pecking order: Prince Charles takes a keen interest in poultry on a visit to Abbey Home Farm in Cirencester

As an eager environmentalist, Prince Charles has always been keen to use his vast tracts of land to help foster some of the world’s endangered species.

Now he is set to help save some rare chickens from extinction – but the crucial decision about which breeds to rescue could come down to one simple point: what colour eggs they lay.

The Prince is said to favour brown eggs, which he – like the Queen – believes taste better than white ones.

That opinion has little basis in science, but it could sway his judgment when it comes to choosing vulnerable breeds to add to his collection at the Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire. 

Experts from the Rare Breeds Survival Trust have been asked to draw up a shortlist of hen types for Charles to consider, and will include details of their eggshells in their brief.

Martin Anderson, chairman of the trust, said: ‘The Prince is a staunch supporter of rare breeds.

He wishes to build up hen numbers and thought it was fitting to choose rare breeds.

I will write some notes about each breed and the colour of their eggs and the Prince can choose for himself.

‘I was told he likes to eat brown eggs but I am going to suggest the breeds that need most help and not worry about the eggs.’

The colour of a breed’s egg is genetically determined, and, contrary to popular opinion, has nothing to do with diet – which is what affects the taste.

A bright yolk is linked to a hen eating lots of cabbage and foraging freely on grass.

The Prince already keeps a small number of hens at Highgrove, including Dutch Wellsummers and French Maran, which supply dark speckled eggs to the Royal household.

Now he wants to add more, both for their eggs and to help incubate chicks of rarer breeds. 

Candidates for inclusion in the Royal grounds include the Modern Langshan, one of the rarest breeds in Britain, with fewer than 50 breeding hens surviving. 

These tall, black-feathered birds – which do lay brown eggs – were originally imported from China in 1872, but fell out of fashion during the 1930s.

Another contender is the North Holland Blue, a large black and white hen that was developed in the late 19th Century. Today there are fewer than 100 breeding hens in the country.

It also lays a brown egg, though it may be too pale for the Prince’s taste.

Top of Mr Anderson’s list, however, is the Spanish, of which there are just a handful in Britain. 

This is a striking white-faced, shiny black-feathered hen, which has a long wattle– the flap of skin hanging from its neck – and resembles a bearded old man. But it produces large, white eggs.

Mr Anderson said: ‘This breed needs a
lot of help and hopefully the Prince will agree to them. We know he 
wants to develop the breeding side. 

‘We
expect him to start with a trio of each breed he chooses, two hens and a
cockerel.  Each breed needs be kept separately and the cockerels must 
be segregated from the hens.’

Another breed at risk is the Scots Grey, which has existed in Scotland for 200 years but is now very rare, and lays a tinted white egg. 

The Prince, who is patron of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, may also be attracted to the Welbar, which was created by a Devon breeder during the Second World War and which lays a distinctive terracotta egg.

There is also the Rhodebar, which was developed by a Sussex breeder in 1950 and also lays brown eggs. 

The Prince has long been lampooned for being fussy about boiled eggs, with reports he was served seven each day to make sure there was a perfect one.

But the claim, first made by Jeremy Paxman in his 2006 book On Royalty, was last year rubbished as ‘totally untrue’ by Clarence House.
