David Cameron today insisted he will not pay 'anything like' the £1.7billion being demanded by the EU - after Brussels chiefs warned the UK rebate could be up for grabs if he does not pay up.

Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik said it would be 'extremely difficult' for the Prime Minister to challenge the EU's demand for extra cash  – despite Mr Cameron's angry insistence that he will not pay it by the due date of December 1.

Mr Dominik said the move risked opening a 'Pandora's box' which could put the future of the UK's £3billion-a-year rebate in question. 

But in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment.'

And in a clear indication that he believes the row has undermined public support for EU membership, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘For those of us who want to argue that the European Union is capable of reform, this was not a good development.’

David Cameron was today facing fresh questions over why he did not challenge the EU's £1.7 billion demand earlier

Mr Cameron added: ‘We will be challenging this in every way possible. We want to check on the way the statistics were arrived at, the methodology that was used. We will crawl through this in exhaustive detail.’

And he told MPs: ‘We are not paying two billion on December 1 and we are not paying a sum anything like that. That is very clear.

‘When your economy grows, you pay a bit more. When your economy shrinks, you pay a bit less. But what is not acceptable is a two billion euro bill and we won't be paying it.’

But the Prime Minister was accused of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who said Mr Cameron should have been aware for at least two years that changes to Britain's contribution to the EU budget were in the offing.

Ukip MP Douglas Carswell tweeted: ‘Classic Dave: PM sounding tough but so far not actually ruling out paying £1.7 billion. After December. After all the bluster.’ 

Any change would require amendments to EU law supported by a majority of European countries.

European Commissioner Mr Dominik warned that the UK was obliged by law to pay by this deadline and would be liable for 'late payment fines' if it failed to hand over the cash.

Mr Dominik said he was 'surprised' by the PM's reaction, insisting that the adjustment of Britain's contribution to the EU budget - known in Brussels jargon as 'own resources' - was a routine annual procedure about which London was well aware. 

The figures behind the calculation were provided by the UK's Office for National Statistics and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge being demanded, he said.

The Commissioner warned that opening up discussions over the EU's budget threatened the British rebate.

David Cameron was left red-faced last week after he was forced to admit he had been kept in the dark for days about the shock £1.7billion demand after George Osborne failed to inform him.

The surprise bill was presented to the Treasury by the EU Commission on Friday October 17.

But extraordinarily it was almost a week before the Prime Minister learnt about it on Thursday.

And according to Labour, the Office for National Statistics might have known about it five months ago. 

But asked what prospect there was for a renegotiation of the cash demand, Mr Dominik told a Brussels press conference: 'Never in the past was there a situation where such a decision was changed and the implementation regulations changed because one of the member states have contested it.

'I am afraid that it will be extremely difficult to do it, especially because the own resources decision and implementation regulations concern as well the UK's rebate, so if you open this for future negotiations, you open a Pandora's box.'

But Mr Cameron's official spokesman responded: ‘The rebate remains entirely justified. It is not on the table.’

Mr Dominik said that the same calculation of Britain's gross national income (GNI) produced by the ONS would result in a £500 million increase in the rebate next year, and added: 'I think it would be extremely difficult to explain to other member states why on Monday you like this data, and on Tuesday you don't like it.'

Responding to Mr Cameron's claim that the demand was sprung on Britain with little notice, Mr Dominik said: 'I was surprised by the reaction because ... up to this moment there was no single signal from the UK administration that they had problems with this figure.'

Speaking to a Westminster press briefing, Mr Cameron's official spokesman made clear that there was no question of the PM putting Britain's rebate - negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 - on the table.

Asked if it was correct that the rebate would not be on the table when Chancellor George Osborne meets fellow finance ministers, the spokesman said: 'Yes.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of being 'asleep at the wheel' over the EU budget demand

Mr Osborne is later this week expected to discuss the surcharge demand with EU finance ministers, including Germany's Wolfgang Schauble, in the margins of an OECD summit in Berlin on Wednesday.

Speaking during a visit to Leeds, Mr Cameron said: 'We face tough battles in Europe because that's the nature of what you have to do.'

He added: 'I think Britain is best off in a reformed European Union - but you have to fight for those reforms. That means a fair deal over funding, a fair deal over migration, [it] means access to European markets, but these things aren't achieved without a fight.'

The French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of Fawlty Towers.

All major outlets highlighted the Prime Minister’s fury, with the Dauphine Libere running the headline: ‘Angry Cameron refuses to take out his cheque book for Europe’.

Europe 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the Fawlty Towers theme, portraying Mr Cameron as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit Basil Fawlty’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring John Cleese.

Europe 1 writes on its website: ‘A diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu, David Cameron refuses to pay the bill.

‘It has to be said this is a bit rich, because Brussels is demanding an additional two billion euros from Britain as part of its share of EU budget.

‘Faced with this request, the British Prime Minister has abandoned the traditional English reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on Friday.’

Le Parisien runs a picture showing Mr Cameron with his mouth wide open, and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the UK Independence Party.

‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote.

Like many other papers, L’Express and Le Monde concentrate on the reaction of Francois Hollande to the growing crisis, quoting the clearly irritated Socialist president as saying: ‘Respecting treaties is for everybody.’
