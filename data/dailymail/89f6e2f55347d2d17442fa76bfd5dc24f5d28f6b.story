A group of women have launched an online support campaign for girlfriend killer and Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius via Twitter.

The women, who call themselves the #Pistorians, aim to defend 
the reputation of their hero - who is currently charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Miss Steenkamp was 
shot after she locked herself in his bathroom in the early hours of 
Valentine’s Day. Pistorius claims he mistook her for an intruder.

The group -  which is reportedly unofficially led by a woman from the UK called Laura Lambden  - includes supporters in South Africa, Germany, and the island of Borneo.

Members have vowed to stand by Pistorius throughout his trial, and tweet support for the athlete under the hashtag #Pistorians, channel24 reports

It echoes the way singer Chris Brown was defended by his Twitter fanclub #teambreezy after his attack on girlfriend Rihanna.

Last week, on Thursday, the Pistorians defended the paralympian while he appealed to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to have his bail conditions relaxed.

Laura Lambden, tweeted early morning support for the Olympian's legal team -  advocate Barry Roux and attorney Kenny Oldwage: 'Morning #Pistorians! Let's focus our energies on Mr Roux and Mr Oldwage today!'

Miss Steenkamp was a budding model who had been dating Pistorius for only a short time before he shot her dead at his Silver Woods estate home.

The support group was mobilised just days after he was arrested.

The fans post collections of semi naked images of Pistorius - who they refer to as OP - under the hashtag #OscarPorn. 

Ms Lamben, has now set up a new twitter account and writes under the name of @LiliTyger.

Her recent tweets explained why she was supporting the athlete

She wrote: 'I support Oscar because I believe in innocent until proven guilty; 
because the State appear to have no evidence, so far, to back their ...

.. charge of PM murder. I feel for the Steenkamps, losing a child. I don't attack people. I am a #pistorian and proud to be one!'

Other 'Pistorians' appear to have turned their wrath to Miss Steenkamp,  for posing in a bikini.

One user tweeted 'Errr like she was a bikini model. "Sex sells"!!! I would be really upset if my daughter posed like that.' The comment appears to have now been deleted.

On Thursday, Judge Bert Bam relaxed Pistorius's bail conditions, allowing him to travel abroad as long as he informs his lawyers a week ahead of time.

He will also no longer have to undergo routine drug and alcohol tests and would no longer be subjected to unannounced visits from his probation officer.

He would also be allowed to return home once the police have finished gathering forensic evidence.
