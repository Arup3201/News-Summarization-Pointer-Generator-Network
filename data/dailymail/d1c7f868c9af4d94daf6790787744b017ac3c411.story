Her life was cut tragically short 16 years ago when she was found bound and gagged with duct tape in her parent’s basement, bludgeoned to death.

But for six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, there could be new clues into the horrific murder that has fascinated America for more than a decade. 

The former detective on the case is officially breaking his silence, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child’s toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case.

New clues? JonBenet Ramsey, a child beauty queen, was brutally murdered in her home in Boulder, Colorado; a former detective says that overlooked clues may solve the cold case

Curious case: The detective says a faint cobweb along the window hints that there was never an intruder who entered the house

In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, former detective Jim Kolar reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports.

He told the Daily Beast that he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back.

The child’s father, John Ramsey, told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement.

But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler points out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly.

Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence, and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house.

Child beauty queen: JonBenet Ramsey was found bludgeoned and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996

On Christmas Day of 1996, the family received a ransom note saying they had kidnapped JonBenet and were demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently received - or else she would be beheaded.

But it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house.

Her wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth. An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.

Within hours, the Ramseys themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticized for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - instead of following up other leads.

For the next 12 years, the blame for their beautiful daughter's death - who was given the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer.

Eventually, Boulder district attorney’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying, and issued an apology in 2008.

Since then, John Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business, and Patsy to ovarian cancer in 2006.

Mr Ramsey eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, last July.

But he hangs on to hope his daughter's killer will be found and meet justice, and says he still 'would like to know' who is responsible.

'Everybody has a burden, and I wanted to tell people it doesn't last forever,' he said. 'There is light at the end of the tunnel.'
