A seven-year-old girl narrowly avoided choking after she took a bite of a KFC chicken burger containing a metal nut.

Leah Neat asked for some of her father's burger while on a family outing at the KFC in Gravesend, Kent.

But when she passed it back to Daniel Neat, 35, he was shocked to find a piece of metal in the middle of the burger.

Mother Sharon Neat, 35, said: 'It was my husband's burger but you know what children are like.

'My daughter said 'dad can I have a bite' so she did and when she passed it back he said 'there's a nut in that'.

'I said 'people can be allergic to that' and my husband said 'no, it's a metal nut'.

'It's not the sort of thing you expect to find in your burger. It really has put the children off eating there again.'

She spent more than £35 on two barbecue pulled chicken meals, three boneless banquets, two barbecue wraps and one lunch box meal for her three children, husband, grandmother and uncle.

Mrs Neat was told a full investigation would be launched but the mother-of-three has claimed she won't step back into the store in Kent.

A KFC spokesman said: 'We take food safety extremely seriously and immediately launched an investigation into the matter to determine whether the object originated in store, which is ongoing.

'Nonetheless, as soon we were made aware of the situation we apologised on the spot and offered a full refund to the Neat family, which they accepted in the restaurant.

'We would like to reassure customers that our Valley Drive restaurant achieved a food hygiene rating of five out of five stars meaning that the business was found to have very good hygiene standards.'
