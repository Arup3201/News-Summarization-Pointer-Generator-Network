A marine received an extra special surprise on Friday morning when he was reunited with the dog that had served with him in Afghanistan.

During his tour of deputy, Sgt. Ross Gundlach of Madison, Wisconsin had grown very attached to Casey, a four-year-old golden Labrador, who he credits with saving his life.

The two successfully completed 150 combat missions together in Afghanistan's south Helmand Province.

‘About midway through, I told her if we made it out alive I'd do whatever it took to find her,’ Gundlach told The Des Moines Register.

Before Friday morning the pair hadn’t seen each other since last June. 

After leaving Afghanistan, Casey was adopted by the Iowa State Fire Marshal’s Office last November to serve as an explosive detection canine.

But once the Fire Marshall’s Office found out Sgt. Gundlach was trying to adopt Casey they knew they had to return the dog to her rightful owner.

‘The first time I talked to him... (Gundlach) said, “I would swim to Japan to get my dog,”’ said State Fire Marshal Ray Reynolds.

Sgt. Gundlach, 25, thought he was visiting Des Moines on Friday to plead his case before a government committee to get Casey back.

Unknown to him, the Iowa Elks Association had donated $8,500 to purchase K-9 Vega as a replacement for Casey.

When Sgt. Gundlach was told that Casey was there for him to take home, he was almost overcome with emotion.

Despite being apart for each other for almost a year, it was immediately clear that Casey remembered Gundlach.

Her paws slipped out from under her from excitement when they saw each other, and her tail wagged throughout the 30-minute presentation.

‘I owe her. I want to take care of her...I'll just try to give her the best life she can have from here on out,’ said Sgt. Gundlach.

He plans to return home with him to Madison, where he has enrolled at the University of Wisconsin.
