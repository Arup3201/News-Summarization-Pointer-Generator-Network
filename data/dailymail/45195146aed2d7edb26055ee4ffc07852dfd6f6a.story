Perhaps call that taxi after all - new research has has found that more than one in three designated drivers have had a drink and most had blood-alcohol levels high enough to affect their driving.

The study also revealed that 18 per cent drink more than is safe before driving home from a night out.

Researchers from the University of Florida interviewed and breath-tested more than 1,000 party-goers at a bar in America.

Concerning: A new study has found that more than one in three designated drivers have had a drink and most had blood-alcohol levels high enough to affect their driving

They discovered that of all of the designated drivers who had consumed alcohol, half recorded a blood-alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drunken driving in the U.S.

The researchers recruited volunteers as they left the bar between 10pm and 2.30am on six different Friday nights.

The average age of the participants was 28, and most were white male college students.

Professor Adam Barry, lead author of the study, said: ‘If you look at how people choose their designated drivers, oftentimes they're chosen by who is least drunk or who has successfully driven intoxicated in the past—successful meaning got home in one piece ... that's disconcerting.’

Results: Half recorded a blood-alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drink driving in the U.S

Professor Barry said he didn’t know why a designated driver would consume alcohol, but factors could include group dynamics or the driver’s belief that one or two drinks won’t impair his skills if he is an experienced drinker.

It was also tricky to measure your own sobriety after a drink, he said, adding: ‘That’s the insidious nature of alcohol - when you feel buzzed, you’re drunk.’

At .08 per cent, the U.S. and UK currently have one of the highest allowable legal limits of any developed country.

Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Greece use the .05 level, Russia and Sweden are at .02 per cent and Japan has a zero tolerance policy.

While most experts recommend that people who intend to drive do not drink anything, there are things you can do to reduce the amount of alcohol in your blood after drinking.

Dr Bhaskar Punukollu, a specialist addiction psychiatrist at the Clinical Partners practice, and at Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust in London said: ‘Roughly, you absorb about one unit of alcohol an hour, but drink after some food and the rate it enters your bloodstream is slowed.

‘Food absorbs some of the alcohol, and while the gut is absorbing key nutrients from the food, it’ll be far less efficient in absorbing the alcohol.’

Despite having the same number of drinks, someone who starts on an empty stomach can have three times more alcohol in their blood compared with those who have eaten a small meal beforehand, he says: ‘Alternating alcoholic with soft drinks can also slow down the effects.’

Male drivers are also able to consume more alcohol before they find themselves over the legal limit.

Dr Martin Prince, a heptologist at BMI The Alexandra Hospital in Cheadle, Cheshire, explained that, as a general rule, if you’re larger or male, your body can process alcohol faster.

However, women also have the additional disadvantage that their bodies are made up of more fat and less water than men’s - they carry 52 per cent water, compared to the 61 per cent in men.

This means a man’s body will automatically dilute the alcohol more than a woman’s, even if they weigh the same. Women also have less dehydrogenase, the liver enzyme that breaks down alcohol.
