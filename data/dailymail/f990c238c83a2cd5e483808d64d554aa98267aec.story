It was supposed to be a festive cruise to sample the delights of Amsterdam’s Christmas markets.

But after days at sea the closest passengers got to the Netherlands was a view from the ship’s deck.

Holidaymakers were forced to return empty-handed to Southampton last night after spending four days doing circles in the English Channel because of bad weather.

Around 2,100 passengers on board the Queen Elizabeth were furious at the decision to turn back and the decision sparked a ‘mutiny’ from frustrated travellers.

All at sea: Bad weather kept the Queen Elizabeth back from docking in Amsterdam, causing the ship to circle the channel for four days

They stormed the reception desk and clapped and chanted: ‘We want the captain’, demanding to know what was going on.

Matters were only made worse when Cunard, the company that runs the Queen Elizabeth, announced that passengers would only be compensated for their £400 tickets with $75 (around £48) in on-board spending credit.

Passenger Charmaine Lynch, 50, from Aldershott, had been travelling with her family to celebrate her parents' 55th wedding anniversary.

Groups of passengers staged a 'mutiny' over the strong smell of diesel and the ship's inability to dock in Amsterdam

She told MailOnline: 'It is my parents'  anniversary in January and my father hasn't been well, so I thought it would be perfect to do a pre-Christmas holiday with my daughter and her husband too.

'It was my parents' first trip with Cunard and I had been explaining exactly what it would be like. Don't I look stupid now.' 

After four days of sailing up and down the Channel, along with the strong smell of diesel in her cabin, Ms Lynch and her family were incredibly disappointed.

She said: 'It was not Cunard's finest hour. I have done other cruises with the company and this wasn't their usual standard.

'I do appreciate that high winds could cause a problem but the Marco Polo cruise ship could make it into port.

'We just had one update each day from the captain, then silence for 24 hours. Only late yesterday did he tell us we would have $75 (£48) compensation to spend on board, but didn't tell us the shops would shut at 7pm.

'We don't drink, so we couldn't use it towards our bill, so our only chance to spend the money was in the shop.' 

Many passengers on board the ship were taking the cruise as a special celebration

Paul Rolfe claims the constant smell of diesel made his mother feel ill on board

Passengers grouped together on Twitter to discuss possible theories about why the ship had failed to dock

Steve Gordon, 42, from Stratford-upon-Avon was also disappointed after booking the trip with his wife and mother as a Christmas treat.

A loyal customer of Cunard, he told MailOnline that perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the trip was the fact it didn't live up to the company's normally faultless reputation.

He said: 'The ship smelt of diesel throughout the cruise. When we went for lunch, it was so crowded we just had to grab our food and go, and when we couldn't dock, we were being fed information by staff but not from the person it should be coming from - the captain.

'It just went from there. They didn't lay on any extra entertainment, so people were just walking around and morale really dropped. 

'I demanded to speak to someone higher up and the hotel manager was apologetic, he admitted they had dropped the ball.'

The ship was supposed to dock in Amsterdam so passengers could visit the Christmas market

Mr Gordon also claimed that staff he spoke to had been expecting traditional 'booze cruisers' rather than seasoned Cunard customers for the trip.

He said: 'Staff said they just weren't anticipating Cunard customers, they were thinking it would just be booze cruisers hence why they didn't turn on the bells and whistles'.

Upon embarking, Mr Gordon and his wife were given a gold badges to welcome them as frequent cruisers, but he said he would have preferred better customer service to a gold badge.

'We were sharing a stateroom with my mother and simple things were missing, like a robe and slippers for her, and even pillows for her bed. I would have preferred they sorted things like that out than offer us gold badges.'

The family decided to leave the ship when it docked in Southampton last night, rather than remain on board until this morning. 

Fury: Angry tourists take to Twitter to express their disappointment with the cruise ship, including one woman who was on her honeymoon when the vessel was forced to turn back

Tension had been brewing on board the ship for several days as the ship repeatedly circled the Channel.

Bored passengers were told they would be given an ‘upgraded entertainment’ package to make up for missing their time in the Dutch city but last night passengers claimed the only activity ‘worth doing’ was a pub quiz which was so oversubscribed people were forced to sit on the floor.

Sophie Humphrey, 30, and her mother Eve, 64, both from Cambridgeshire paid £389 each to go on the cruise, which left Southampton on Friday.

Miss Humphrey said it was ‘outrageous’ they were offered only £48 compensation after the cruise had failed to reach its destination and labelled the company ‘a complete shambles.’ She added: ‘For four days we’ve just been going around in circles.

‘There has been a small mutiny on board by the passengers, everyone was very angry. It’s terrible, there are two thousand of us and not a single person is happy.

‘It was supposed to be a Christmas treat for me and my mum but not only have we had our money wasted but our time as well.’

The ship had been due to return to Southampton early this morning but in fact arrived last night – ten hours ahead of schedule because of necessary engineering works.

Even before the problem with the weather occurred, passengers were complaining of a strong smell of diesel at the front of the ship making it ‘disgusting’ to use the casinos and several shops.

As they arrived at Southampton last night, many passengers tweeted their frustration at Cunard. Jenny Meadows called it the ‘worst cruise ever’, adding: ‘Thanks Cunard for wasting our time, money & wrecking our honeymoon.’ Claire Mills added: ‘Nothing but lies, poor service and a shambles of a response.’

Last night Cunard claimed guests had not lost out since all the facilities on the ship were open for them to ‘enjoy’ throughout their trip.

A spokesman said that passengers were given a ‘gesture of goodwill’, adding: ‘The captain looked at two alternative ports of call which were both unsuitable due to similar weather conditions.’
