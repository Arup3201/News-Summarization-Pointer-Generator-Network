Phillipa Jutton was five times over the alcohol limit when she repeatedly crashed into a parked car

A woman repeatedly crashed into a parked car as she tried to escape while being five times over the legal limit to drive. 

Phillipa Jutton, 33, appeared to try to make a frantic escape after a passerby tried to talk to her after spotting her asleep at the wheel as her car rolled forward and crashed into a parked car. 

The resident appeared to startle Jutton into making a frantic getaway in her car, parked on a residential road.  

She then tried to get away from the road in Eastbourne in Sussex, crashing into the same car a further three times. 

When she was stopped by police in her Toyota Aygo she was breathalysed. 

Jutton was found to have 188mg of alcohol in her breath. 

This is more than five times the legal limit of 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.

A spokesman for Sussex police said Jutton had placed herself and others in danger by being in the car after she had been drinking. 

He said: 'Jutton was well over the limit but has refused to tell us what she was doing before she was found behind the wheel. 

'So we do not know how long she was drinking for or why she decided to drive.

'What we can say for certain is that she put herself and other people in danger through her selfish decision to get into a car when she must have known she was nowhere near fit to drive.'

The incident took place in Glebe Close in Eastbourne at about 10pm on October 15.

The incident took place on a quiet residential road in Eastbourne, when Jutton was spotted in the rolling car

Jutton was sentenced at Hastings Magistrates' Court to 6 weeks in prison and banned from driving for 3 years
