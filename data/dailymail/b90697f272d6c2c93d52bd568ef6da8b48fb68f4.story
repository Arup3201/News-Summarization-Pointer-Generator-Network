Geoff Pullar, the former England, Lancashire and Gloucestershire batsman, has died aged 79.

The left-hander made his Test debut as an opener against India in 1959, scoring 75 at Headingley, and 131 at Old Trafford, the ground’s first Test century by a Lancastrian.

Pullar became a fixture in the England side for four years, making four centuries and averaging more than 43 in 28 Tests.

Affectionately nicknamed ‘Noddy’ - he was known to sleep in the dressing room while team-mates were at the crease - Pullar did well against South Africa in the home series of 1960, following a solid winter tour of the West Indies where he played in all five Tests against a bowling attack including Wes Hall, Garfield Sobers and Charlie Griffith.

He topped the batting averages on the 1961-62 tour to India and Pakistan in 1961-62 despite bagging a pair in the first Test in Pakistan.

Pullar’s highest Test score was 175 against the South Africans at The Oval in 1960, when he put on 290 for the first wicket with Colin Cowdrey.

When Pullar scored 131 at Old Trafford against India he was the ground’s first Lancastrian Test centurion

After the 1962-63 tour to Australia, during which he contracted pleurisy, Pullar lost his England place and never regained it. 

Joining Gloucestershire in 1969, he topped the county’s batting averages in his first season but arthritis forced his retirement in 1970.

Pullar was the Cricket Writers’ Association 1959 Young Cricketer of the Year and in 1960 he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He also won a junior England cap for table tennis.
