He lies in bed looking desperately weak and gaunt, apparently with just days to live.

But Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi summoned up enough strength in his ‘final’ interview to insist he would be proved innocent in death.

Speaking in the run up to the 23rd anniversary of the atrocity that killed 270, the former Libyan intelligence officer appealed to his supporters to fight on to clear his name.

His head supported by a special pillow as he lay in bed at the family home in Tripoli, the 59-year-old asked that he be left alone to die from the ravages caused by prostate cancer.

‘I am an innocent man,’ Megrahi pleaded, but said he was too weak and tired to explain in detail why he believed his name would be  eventually cleared.

Megrahi revealed that he was recently 
visited by Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing of Pan
Am Fight 103, and had confided in him details of dramatic new 
discoveries made by investigators working to clear his name.

Pivotal to these, it is understood, 
are new forensic studies of fragments of a circuit board alleged to have
been a piece of the bomb  that was the single most crucial piece of 
evidence linking the bombing to Libya.

Dr
Swire, who is convinced Megrahi is innocent and has repeatedly spoken 
out on his behalf, refused to comment on the new discoveries last 
night. 

The images of the frail bomber are the
first to be seen of him in more than six weeks and appear to show a 
marked deterioration in his condition. Propped on pillows and covered by
a thick floral blanket, he spoke slowly and falteringly, sometimes 
closing his deeply-sunken eyes as he considered answers.

Megrahi
is the only person convicted of the December 21, 1988 bombing. He was 
controversially released on compassionate grounds from a life sentence 
in August 2009 because of his terminal illness.

In
the interview he accused the authorities of deliberately withholding 
investigation interviews with a key prosecution witness from his lawyers
for more than a decade.

That witness was Maltese shopkeeper 
Tony Gauci, who identified the Libyan as resembling the man who 
purchased clothes which were subsequently found in the remains of the 
suitcase containing the bomb.

Despite
his weakness, Megrahi became angry at the mention of Gauci.

He said his
lawyers had not been able to secure all the 55, sometimes allegedly 
conflicting, statements made by the shopkeeper and added: ‘Where is the 
justice?

'There is no justice.’ It had always been believed Gauci was the only witness who could identify the buyer of the clothes but Megrahi claims new evidence will prove the shopkeeper’s brother also met with him.

‘This information has never been raised before,’ he said, ‘There is an opportunity to have another physical witness who could have identified the man, yet they kept the brother out of it.’

Megrahi was given a hero’s welcome on his return to Libya and feted by Colonel Gaddafi.

In
the interview he condemns two retired Scottish detectives as the main 
architects of the ‘fabricated case’ against him.

He is pinning great 
hope, he said, on a book to be published early next year he has 
co-written with journalist and investigator John Ashton.

‘I want people to read the book and use their brain not hearts and make judgment,’ he said, ‘Information is not from me, not from lawyers, not from the media, but experts who deal with criminal law and science. It will clear my name.’

The Megrahi interview on December 15 was conducted by George Thomson, a former police officer, who is now a criminal defence investigator.

It is due to be used in a TV documentary to be broadcast in February.

The pair became close after Mr Thompson joined the defence team in January 2003 looking into the case.

Mr Thompson said: ‘It saddens me that if justice is ever done in this case, he won’t be there to see it done.’
