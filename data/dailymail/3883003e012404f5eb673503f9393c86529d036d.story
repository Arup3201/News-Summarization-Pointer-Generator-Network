A terrified woman has revealed her boyfriend of two years repeatedly raped her while she slept.

Naomi Hampson, 27, of Nottingham, only found out she had regularly fallen victim to Robert Fryer when police raided their home - and said her life was 'shattered into thousands of tiny pieces'.

The office administrator’s perverted boyfriend would sedate her and often paint her nails and dress her in jewellery before taking photographs of his revolting acts and saving them on his computer.

Miss Hampson told the Sunday People: 
'I'm disgusted when I think about what he did. It makes me feel dirty 
and completely violated. Not remembering anything makes it worse.

'It is so sinister all that time I was
 living with someone capable of that. He has no emotion. He is evil. And
 if the police hadn't found out I could have still been living with him.
 It's terrifying.'

Fryer, 30, admitted raping her three times between 2008 and 2011 and pleaded guilty to a 
separate charge of sexual activity. He was jailed at Nottingham Crown 
Court for eight years in September.

Policeman's son Fryer has the rare 
condition somnophillia - also known as 'sleeping princess syndrome' - 
where people get a sexual thrill from others who are asleep, the court 
was told.

The couple moved in together after 
meeting on a night out in 2008, and Fryer soon took advantage of Miss 
Hampson, who struggled emotionally after her father John, 77, was 
diagnosed with cancer.

Miss Hampson was drinking more than 
usual but would wake up on the sofa or in bed without any knickers on 
and sometimes wearing nail polish or jewellery - but had no memory of 
falling sleep.

The woman had been single for three 
years before meeting Fryer - a spectacle technician with no 
previous convictions who even went to her father’s funeral while the 
abuse continued.

Fryer was arrested after he told a 
friend about his despicable attacks, with officers later showing the 
pictures to Miss Hampson and explaining that they believed he had 
sedated her.

Miss Hampson, who waived her right to 
anonymity to speak out, said Fryer had made out she was drinking too 
much. She called him a psychopath and believes he got a thrill from 
confused people.

She told the Sunday People: 'My entire
 life has been shattered into thousands of tiny pieces and my soul feels 
broken. I hate him for what he did to me.'

Police believe Fryer used a drug 
to sedate Miss Hampson, although a judge said that he either 
used alcohol or drugs. She cried in court as he was sentenced but said 
he did not look at her.

Miss Hampson plans to leave her local area and is not yet thinking about going out with another man.
