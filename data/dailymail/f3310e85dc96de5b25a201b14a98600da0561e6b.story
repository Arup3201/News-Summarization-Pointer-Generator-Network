A cyclist has suffered a freak accident after being knocked to the ground by a kangaroo while riding on a bustling highway.

Bronwyn Calver, a member of the winning Australian women’s cricket team from 1997, was riding down Adelaide Avenue in Canberra at 6.25pm on Monday when a kangaroo abruptly leaped in front of her bike.

GoPro vision of the crash shows Ms Calver, 45, sent sprawling onto the road as onlookers quickly approach to offer her aid.

Ms Calver told Daily Mail Australia the crash happened so fast she had no time to process what had happened.

‘It was over in a split second. As soon as I saw the kangaroo he was under the wheel and I was hurtling over the side.’

The kangaroo, disoriented by the fall, jumped across the gap and fell into an overpass, where it was hit by a car and died.

Ms Calver suffered deep scratches from the fall and received stitches from intensive care paramedics at the scene, but she avoided serious injury. 

‘My elbow and knee took the brunt of the fall. It was a long cut, about 11cm long and very deep. I had 8 stitches but luckily no broken bones,’ she said.

Ms Calver, a public servant, was on her way home from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development in Civic when the incident took place.

‘I have seen kangaroos on that route before, so I was already riding slow, but I've never seen them in that area. I was in a bicycle lane, so it was pretty bizarre.’

Four cars stopped immediately, helping her from harms way and calling an ambulance.

Ms Calver was inducted into the ACT Sport Hall of Fame in 2013.

She was a member of the winning Australian team in the 1997 Women's Cricket World Cup.
