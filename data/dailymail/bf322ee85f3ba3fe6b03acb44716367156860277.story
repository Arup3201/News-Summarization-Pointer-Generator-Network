While the country enjoys warm weather with temperatures hitting 22C and no sign of snow, councils have been criticised for putting hundreds of gritters and staff on duty.

West Sussex County Council had 25 gritting lorries - almost its entire 28-strong fleet – driving around the county on practice runs this week as part of 'Operation Snowflake' and leaving sunbathers gobsmacked.

In Cumbria, the council's 33 gritters have also been out on priority roads for their own dummy runs.

Local authorities across Scotland have followed suit by putting 500 staff and 160 vehicles on standby, while councils like Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have launched their annual winter plans.

Despite the fine weather, around 25 gritters, like this one in Cumbria, have been sent out by West Sussex County Council as part of a rehearsal for the winter dubbed 'Operation Snowflake' 

People out punting on the river Cam in Cambridge have enjoyed a beautiful sunny start to October as temperatures stay in the high teens to low 20s

It has been a great day to laze about by the river across the country as the fine weather continues into October with temperatures set to stay mild for the coming days

But critics have hit out at the costs involved, with gritting schemes estimated to cost around £160million nationally each year between October and April – an average of £23million per month.

While the council preparations continue, the Met Office said there is no sign of snow or ice in the 30-day outlook period ahead, with highs of 22C predicted.

Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: 'There's no strong signal in the outlook for things turning noticeably colder with snow or ice.'

According to the Met Office, last month saw the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler. 

And Weather Services International has forecast a warmer than average October, November and December across the UK.

John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's hard to see what good can come from this exaggerated exercise.

'Gritting does not strike us as something that needs a huge amount of rehearsal. It's not the cheapest to keep the roads free of ice, so they shouldn't be wasting money when it's frankly unnecessary.'

Surprised Twitter user John Muir, who spotted one of the gritting lorries, complained: 'Seen a gritter on the A1. Where's the frost? Councils don't waste our money, do they?'

West Sussex County Council, which has stockpiled 10,500 tonnes of salt, said practice runs were to record road alterations, check for faster routes and re-familiarise drivers with roads.

Boost for gardeners: The Met Office has said this September was one of the driest since records began in 1910, with exceptionally low rainfall for many parts of the country

Pieter Montyn, the council's cabinet member for highways, said: 'There are road changes to consider every year. The rehearsal was vital preparation.'

Nottinghamshire County Council has put its gritting fleet and 23 permanent night shift drivers on duty, with 46 more drivers on standby.

Councillor Kevin Greaves, chairman of Nottinghamshire County Council's transport and highways committee, commented: 'Our preparations mean that we will be ready to act as soon as any bad weather arrives.

'Like most people we keep our fingers crossed and hope that the coming winter won't be too severe, but we have to be realistic and plan for the worst.' 

A Local Government Association spokesman said: 'There's no room for complacency - which is why councils are already out testing gritting routes and equipment, stockpiling salt and filling grit bins.

'Whatever surprises the weather may have in store this winter, residents can count on councils being as prepared as ever.'
