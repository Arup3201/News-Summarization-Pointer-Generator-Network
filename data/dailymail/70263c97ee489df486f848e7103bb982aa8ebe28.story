No leads: Madeleine McCann

A self-styled security consultant accused of swindling the Madeleine McCann fund out of £300,000 is to be extradited to the United States this week to face fraud charges.

Kevin Halligen, 53, lost his final appeal before the High Court in London on Friday and will be flown to Washington on Thursday to face allegations of cheating former business partners out of £1.2 million.

In 2008, Halligen’s company Oakley International signed a contract to help find Maddie, who went missing in Portugal a year earlier.

He said he would use his MI6 and CIA contacts and high-tech surveillance equipment in the hunt but over six months he came up with no new leads.

He was arrested in Oxford in November 2009 after fleeing Washington DC when the US government began seeking an indictment against him for ‘wire fraud and money laundering’.

US Courts have also ordered Halligen to pay about £4 million to other former business partners who claim he fleeced them.

Halligen had been fighting extradition since his arrest.
