Two young Britons jailed for trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5million out of Peru could be back in the UK by the New Year.

UK authorities have agreed to let Melissa Reid, 20, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 21, transfer to prisons in Scotland and Northern Ireland, near their families.

They are waiting for the Peruvian government to rubber-stamp the move, a process expected to take between three and six months.

Michaella McCollum, 21 and from Dungannon, County Tyrone, is set to be transferred from her jail in Peru to a prison in her home country. Her lawyer has described Peruvian jails as 'horrendous'

Melissa Reid, 20 and from Glasgow, is expected to be transferred to a prison in Scotland

The women, dubbed the Peru Two, were sentenced to six years and eight months in jail after they were found with a huge stash of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check in for a flight from Lima to Madrid a year ago.

Reid, from Glasgow, and McCollum, from County Tyrone, claimed they had been kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to go on a drugs run to Peru by Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. 

But it emerged that they had willingly agreed to smuggle the drugs in return for cash after meeting the dealers on the Spanish party island. 

They can apply for parole halfway through their sentence, meaning they could be free by Christmas 2016. 

They are currently in Ancon 2, a tough desert prison a two-and-a-half- hour drive from Lima, where they share a cell with up to ten other women and the lavatory is a hole in the ground.

A source in Lima said: ‘Britain has agreed to take Melissa and Michaella back. 

'A prisoner repatriation agreement exists between Britain and Peru and Michaella and Melissa have paid compensation before making their transfer request, so the transfer should be approved.’

State prosecutors, a judge and two Peruvian ministries must confirm the transfer.

‘Both women have been model prisoners,’ an insider said. ‘They’ve worked or studied every day since they entered jail. Although they may have broken the law, they’ve shown they’re not really criminals.’

A source close to the pair said: ‘They’re not as happy at Ancon as they were at the other prison because it’s a lot bigger but they’re coping as best they can.

‘They’ve been learning Spanish and working in areas like gardening, the prison kitchen and a hairdressing salon. 

'They’ve resigned themselves to the fact they’re still facing many more nights in jail but their repatriation does represent a light at the end of the tunnel.’

The Irish government has been providing consular support to McCollum, an Irish citizen.

A letter from the Republic's department of foreign affairs said: 'The Peruvian authorities have confirmed that they have accepted Michaella's prison transfer request and have passed this to the UK National Offenders' Management Service which co-ordinates prisoner transfers to the UK.

'In Ms McCollum's case, NOMS liaises with the Northern Ireland Prison Service and with the Peruvian Prison Service on all aspects of the transfer.'

It could be months before she returns home as the logistics of the transfer will be complicated, the note to McCollum's solicitor stated.

Prisoners must be accompanied throughout their journey; airlines and airports must be advised, with security arrangements put in place at departure, transit and final stops.

A Northern Ireland Prison Service spokesman said: 'We don't normally comment on individual cases. All transfer requests are however dealt with as expeditiously as possible.'

Reid's father, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, has said he has met Scotland's justice secretary Kenny MacAskill and is hopeful that his daughter will serve the rest of her sentence closer to home.

Reid and McCollum were caught with the haul at Lima airport on August 6 last year.

They were working on the Spanish party island of Ibiza when they claimed they were forced by Colombian drug lords who kidnapped them at gunpoint to board a flight with 24lb of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage.

McCollum and Reid faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence.

They had previously been held at Lima's Virgen de Fatima prison but were moved to the notorious Ancon 2 prison, where horrific conditions reportedly mean McCollum is crammed into a cell with 30 other prisoners.

The situation at the mixed prison, which is two-and-a-half hours from Lima, has previously been criticised by McCollum's lawyer as 'appalling'.

Kevin Winters said sanitation and toilet facilities are extremely poor and all females have to use a hole in the ground which has to be covered up because of the presence of vermin.
