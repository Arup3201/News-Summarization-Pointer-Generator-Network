Robin van Persie will miss the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony after picking up an injury during Manchester United's defeat by Southampton.

The Holland striker is nominated for the Puskas award for best goal of the year for his diving header against Spain during last year's World Cup in Brazil.

Van Persie will undergo scans to determine the severity of an ankle injury, with good friend Ruud Gullit accepting the award on his behalf should he win.

Van Persie took to Twitter to confirm he would not be travelling to Switzerland on the advice of medical staff.

The Dutch striker also revealed that Gullit, who made 66 appearances for Holland scoring 17 goals, would collect the award on his behalf if he won.

With the third Tweet suggesting that Van Persie is more than a little confident that his flying header will see him scoop the Puskas award.

Does Van Persie already know he's won? Ruud Gullit will collect the award on behalf of the Dutch striker

Van Persie is up against Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez and former Peamount United forward Stephanie Roche at the bash in Switzerland. 

Rodriguez is also nominated because of a goal in last summer's World Cup, with his effort against Uruguay earning the Colombian a place in the final three, and a move to Real Madrid later in the summer.

Roche will become the first woman to pick up the award if her effort against Wexford Youths is voted the winner.

The goal, which demonstrates skill, power and accuracy, earned Roche rave reviews and a six-month deal at French side ASPTT Albi.  

Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer are all up for the Ballon d'Or, with the Portuguese ace fancied to pick up the top prize for the second year in a row.

The former Manchester United star goes up against long-term rival Messi, who has already been named the winner four times in recent years.

Bayern Munich's Neuer makes up the trio of finalists as he looks to become the first goalkeeper to win it since Russian stopper Lev Yashin was in 1963.
