A Sky TV reporter has revealed he was 'devastated' by the suicide of a woman who killed herself days after he exposed her as one of the Twitter trolls who abused the McCann family.

Brenda Leyland, 63, from Burton Overy, Leicestersire, died in  October days after being approached on camera by Martin Brunt.

The reporter confronted her on the subject of hundreds of posts she had written about the McCann family, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007.

At an inquest into her death today Mr Brunt said he was 'devastated' when told she had been found dead days later. 

Brenda Leyland died days after being exposed by Sky News journalist Martin Brunt as one of the Twitter users posting negative messages about the McCann family

'I was devastated, I still am and the enormity of what’s happened will always be with me.' 

He approached the woman on September 30 last year after being given a list of the names of people who had been trolling the family. 

Among some 400 posts written by Mrs Leyland, she described Kate and Gerry McCann as the 'worst of humankind'. 

After tracking the divorcee down to the village in Leicestershire, Mr Brunt and his camera crew approached her outside her house. 

Introducing himself as a Sky News reporter, he asked her why she had been using Twitter to 'attack' the family. 

Mrs Leyland responded: 'I'm entitled to do that,' before saying that a Scotland Yard investigation into  the tweets was 'fair enough'.

She died days later after checking in to a hotel in nearby Enderby. Today Mr Brunt said he was surprised she had engaged with him at all in the days beforehand. 

'I was rather surprised that she did speak to me and did engage with me,' he said. 

Following their filmed exchange Mrs Leyland got in to a parked car and drove away. Later she returned to the house and invited the reporter inside. 

'After she left, we stayed in the village and I did a piece to camera. We were just packing up to go when she returned,' Mr Brunt added. 

The 63-year-old was approached by a Sky News team over her use of Twitter to write messages about the McCann family 

'We approached her again as she walked up to her house and she said "Come in Martin". I went in and spoke to her for about half an hour.

'Once in the house she seemed very relaxed. I said I had caught her on the hop and asked if she would be willing to do an interview in her house, but she wasn't interested.

'I said I hoped I hadn't ruined her day, and she said I hadn't ruined her day - but her life.' 

He added the woman was 'at pains' to explain why she had written the negative messages about the McCann family.  

'She said she had concerns about the fundraising and was concerned they had left Madeleine with her siblings alone. 

'She said, "I have questions for the McCanns".

'She said she thought Twitter was a means to express opinions and hoped she had not done anything unlawful.'

Mr Brunt added he explained the police were in discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service. 

'She acknowledged she was (the Twitter user) "sweepyface" and said "I probably won’t ever tweet again"'.  

The following day Mrs Leyland contacted Mr Brunt on the phone number he had given her during their visit and asked whether she would be identified in the broadcast. 

'I did say I would keep her informed because I am aware of the impact such a confrontation can have on somebody,' he told the inquest. . 

The pair spoke again the night before the clip was shown.    

Asked whether he could detect any concern for her life during their conversation, Mr Brunt said: 'No, but when I asked her how she was, she said "Oh I have thought about ending it all but I am feeling better - I have had a drink and spoken to my son.' 

He added he thought her comments were a throwaway remark and that he had no knowledge of her battle with depression at the time. 

The inquest heard how Mrs Leyland had previously grappled with mental illness and had tried to take her own life once before. 

In a statement her son Ben, who lives in America, said the encounter had left his mother 'panicked'.

'On September 30 she called me and it was clear to me from her tone of voice that she was panicking,' it read. 

'She said "I have been tweeting about the McCanns, I have had a reporter from Sky News here and a report has gone to Scotland Yard"'.

'We discussed what action to take to avoid her name and picture appearing in the media.

Mrs Leyland had posted more than 400 tweets about Kate and Gerry McCann (above) whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007

'On October 2, I was aware the story had broken. I tried to contact my mother without success, I discussed with my dad and brothers going round to check she was OK.

'I got an email from mum on Wednesday saying she felt "cheerier".

'My mum has always struggled with depression and has undergone therapy and psychiatric treatment.

'I have been thinking a lot and have no doubt of the panic and fear in her voice, and think the Sky News report was the final straw.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, Senior Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason described Mrs Leyland as an 'intelligent and loving person'.

'She was aware she had come into the public eye. I have heard all guidelines were followed by Sky and Brenda invited Mr Brunt into her property.

'She was also kept informed of how the story would be run. I am satisfied that although Brenda Leyland did have a medical health history, others wouldn't necessarily have known she was suffering.

'Although she did mention wanting to take her own life, she then dismissed it.'   

'She was upset by her public exposure in the media. She planned (her death) independently and had insight into her actions, so I therefore conclude a verdict of suicide.' 

The cause of her death was given as asphyxiation due to gas inhalation. 

A former psychiatric consultant of Mrs Leyland, Dr Kajetan Zakrewski, said the risk of self-harm had 'always' existed due to her state of mental health. 

Following the coroner's verdict Sky News issued a statement expressing its condolences. 

'The team at Sky News followed its editorial guidelines and pursued a story in a responsible manner that we believed was firmly in the public interest,' it read. 

'Brenda Leyland's tragic death highlights the unforeseeable human impact that the stories we pursue can have, and Sky News would like to extend its sincere condolences to her family.'
