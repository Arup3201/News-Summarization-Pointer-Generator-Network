A chef who was convicted of murder after he admitted stuffing his wife's body in a pot and 'slow-cooking her' fired his attorney at a hearing today.

David Viens, 49, was convicted of 
second-degree murder in September following the death of his wife Dawn
in late 2009. He had confessed to accidentally killing her and then 
cooking her body for four days in an effort to cover up his crime.

Viens told his lawyer at an LA court on Tuesday that his services were no longer required and that he would represent himself at his February 1 sentencing. Viens faces 15 years to life in prison.

The murderer fired attorney Fred McCurry and was overheard saying 'thank you, Fred', according to the Los Angeles Times.

The convicted killer, who had pleaded not guilty, tried to get rid of his attorney earlier in the trial but Judge Rand S. Rubin refused to allow the dismissal.

Viens' decision should not change his sentencing but he could technically argue for the verdict to be dismissed despite this being an incredibly rare process.

Dawn Viens' father and sister were in court on Tuesday and looked anguished at the development which gives the killer the option to file motions until January.

David Viens appeared in court today in a wheelchair and wearing a back brace. He was critically injured when he leapt from a 80-ft cliff in March 2011 near Rancho Palos Verdes as police closed in on him for the crime.

A juror said after the verdict in 
September that it was that apparent suicide attempt which convinced him 
of Viens' guilt, adding: 'My opinion was if he was innocent, he wouldn't
jump off a cliff.'

During the trial, prosecutors
relied on gruesome interrogation tapes in which 
Viens described how he shoved Dawn's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling
water and cooked it until little but her skull was left.

The chef said in the recordings that he mixed what remained of his 
wife after she was boiled up with other waste and then dumped some of it
in a grease pit at his restaurant and put the rest in the trash.

'He treated her like a piece of meat': The couple's friend Karen Patterson told reporters justice had been done when Viens was convicted in September

He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance, California.

His defense attorney Fred 
McCurry said the evidence didn't support a first-degree murder 
conviction against his client, which requires proof of premeditation.

A search of Viens' mother's house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his 
restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles.

On
the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked 
Viens what happened on October 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared.

'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens.

Viens originally claimed his wife ran away to the 
mountains from their restaurant after an argument over 
whether she should go for drug rehabilitation.

But
authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he 
gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other 
personal belongings.

His new girlfriend, Kathy Galvan, then 
took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen 
throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant,
police said.

Suicide bid? The cliffs near the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes in California. Viens jumped over cliffs in the area as he was being chased by police, falling 80ft, but 'amazingly' survived

Police upgraded the case from a missing person case to a homicide after they found blood inside Viens apartment.

They
had been looking for him when they saw the suspect and Kathy Galvan in 
his car on a road near the coastline by Point Vicente Interpretive 
Center near Rancho Palos Verdes.

He
sped off to a lighthouse car park, jumped out and began grappling with 
Ms Galvan before officers tried to intervene. But Viens broke free and 
seemed to purposely leap off the cliff to the beach below.

His sentencing date is set for February 1.
