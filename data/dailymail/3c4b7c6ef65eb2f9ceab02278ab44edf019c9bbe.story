Mauricio Pochettino claims he has the full support of the Tottenham hierarchy despite their poor start to the season.

The Argentine has held daily discussions with chairman Daniel Levy, with discomfort growing at Spurs over their situation in mid-table.

A season which held the potential for a top-four finish currently sees them in 12th, with five defeats from 11 games and four of those coming at White Hart Lane.

Levy is notorious for his contingency planning, but head coach Pochettino is convinced his job is not under threat just months after arriving from Southampton.

He said: ‘We need to be positive, but I understand the supporters at home are not happy.

‘The solution is just for us to play better on the pitch, to give our supporters the message we want to improve to get success.

‘I have a chat every day with (chairman) Daniel (Levy) on the training ground, that is normal. I understand football, but I always feel the support from him and the club.

‘This is important for me, because the people want the best for the club.’

Speaking ahead of Tottenham’s trip to Hull on Sunday, Pochettino reiterated his recent suggestions that his side need to be mentally stronger.

He added: ‘My mentality is to find a solution for positive results, that is my responsibility as a head coach.

‘We have to make sure we analyse the tactical situations, but we need to improve our mentality as a team, to be more strong in all aspects. I tell that to the players, like I do the media.

‘I have to give the tools for us to play better, this is on my shoulders. Now is not the moment to find the guiltiness, it is a moment to be altogether, to be strong.

‘That is our responsibility. My responsibility is to get the results and improve the team.

‘Now we need to look forwards and to try to fix something which has happened in the past. We need to improve.

‘It is a hard job because Tottenham is a big club with big supporters, this is not how we want it to be.

‘But I feel that the same as before, when I was at Southampton and Espanyol.

‘We know the situation is hard, but we need to find a solution.’

Pochettino refused to comment on links with Southampton head of recruitment Paul Mitchell, who is understood to be close to joining the club.
