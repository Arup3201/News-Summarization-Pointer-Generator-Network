The murder of a Texas prosecutor on Saturday, just months after his assistant was gunned down, has raises questions about whether the two lawmen were assassinated by the Aryan Brotherhood as part of a wider plot.

Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland's friend Pete Schutle, a lawyer who handles cases in Kaufman County, is convinced McClelland's slaying is linked with the January 31 death of assistant district attorney Mark Hasse.

Authorities have not publicly named suspects in Hasse's death, but a deputy U.S. Marshal has been quoted a saying investigators believe the Aryan Brotherhood - a powerful white supremacist gang - is behind Hasse's killing.

Kaufman County district attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia. were found murdered in their home Saturday

In January, McLelland was eulogizing assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, and authorities now suspect the killings could be connected

Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January, and had recently pursued cases involving the Aryan brotherhood

'I think it's pretty obvious. Why 
would you go after the assistant district attorney in Kaufman County and
then, less than two months later, you go after the elected?' Mr Schutle
told WFAA-TV.

'I think they have to be related. I 
think anybody who's watching the news would have to say there's a link 
somewhere. We're hoping our law enforcement officials find it quickly.'

McClelland and his wife Cynthia, age 
63 and 65, were found shot dead in their house in Forney, Texas, on 
Saturday. Police have not released any details about the circumstances 
of the murders or how the couple was found.

'It appears this was not a random act,' Forney Mayor Darren Rozell said.

Mr Schulte said his friend McClelland was 'assassinated.'

Brad Lollar, a former Dallas Chief 
Public Defender who hired McLelland to work with severely mentally-ill 
defendants before he became a prosecutor, told theÂ Dallas Morning News 
that investigators must examine the Aryan Brotherhood among the list of 
suspects.

'It could be local meth lab people 
down there in Kaufman County, it could be Mexican cartel, it could be 
the Aryan Brotherhood. Or, it could just be someone with a personal 
grudge,' he said.

Suspects: Authorities said they were searching for on suspects in Hasse's shooting but have yet to make an arrest

Authorities have yet to prove a connection the killings but are assuming one exists until evidence shows otherwise

McLelland's office oversaw a massive 
prosecution of the Aryan Brother, which has a strong presence in Kaufman
County. Two members were convicted and sentenced to prison.

Hasse led those prosecutions.

A member of the U.S. Marshals Service
out of San Antonio wrote in a February email that the Aryan Brotherhood
of Texas could be responsible for his death.

Hasse, 57, was shot dead on January 31 as he walked from his car to his county courtroom office.

He was shot multiple times by at least one gunman, police said.

The
apparent assassination took place at around 8:50 a.m. in a parking lot 
near the courthouse where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed
murder and drug cases.
