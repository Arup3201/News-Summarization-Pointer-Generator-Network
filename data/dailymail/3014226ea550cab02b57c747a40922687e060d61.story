From bushy mutton chops to curling mustachios, the men competing for the title of the world's most impressive beard aficionado don't do things by half as these incredible photos show.

Photographed by Las Vegas shutterbug Greg Anderson, 38, the men are taking part in the Just For Men National Beard and Moustache Championships in New Orleans.

Dedicated to all things facial furniture, classes range from the Fu Manchu ('the tips of the mustache must extend downwards') to the Garibaldi ('wide and rounded at the bottom, and no more than 20 cm in length').

Others have plumped for Amish, Dali or Imperial styles and there's also a freestyle category in which contestants can present a beard or moustache that's as creative (or wacky) as their heart desires.

'The competition attracts an extremely creative group of people, full of free expression,' explained photographer Anderson.Â 

'The beard or moustache that sticks out the most to me has got to be Nate "Chops" Johnson's unbelievable moustache and chop combo.

'It's a thing of beauty,' he continued. 'It's probably the most fun I've ever had on a shoot - it's going to be hard to top.'

Johnson, who holds a staggering 12 titles including coming runner up in the sideburn category at last year's event, will also compete this year.

The competition, which is in its fourth-year, was won by Devon Holcombe of Jacksonville for his 24-inch moustache which was pinned with metal barrettes during the parade.

'People react in various ways to the shots from the Beard and Moustache Competition,' added Anderson.

'Some people love the facial hair, the character of the person or the image itself and some people are repulsed.

'Maybe that's why it's been such a popular group of images. The competitors reactions to my shots have been overwhelmingly positive.

'They take time and prepare for the competition and they appreciate that I took the time and prepared to shoot interesting photos of them.'
