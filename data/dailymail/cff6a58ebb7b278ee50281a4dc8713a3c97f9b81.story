Vincent Kompany is the only defender in the Premier League who I would back in a one-v-one situation against Diego Costa. 

The Chelsea man is one of Europe’s best but so is Kompany: they both have pace, strength and intelligence.

Costa is tough to mark because he bullies defenders, can get on the end of crosses and is fast enough to get away from most people marking him. But it is his touch that surprises me most — he has excellent technical ability with both feet.

Costa's attacking stats make good reading but Kompany seems to have lost a few of his battles

He has a mixture of Dennis Bergkamp’s touch and Didier Drogba’s strength and presence. He can have a tear up or score the perfect goal and that is unusual. 

Every defender in the Premier League will be relishing the chance to play against Costa. Kompany will play him in a fair way — he is not a wind-up merchant — and likewise Costa will know not to waste energy trying to wind up the Belgian. It won’t work. 

Kompany has started the season brilliantly and won’t be thrown around by the Spaniard like Gylfi Sigurdsson was last weekend. Kompany will be thinking, 'You’re not going to do that to me'. 

He will keep tight to him and back himself to win each duel, be that in the air or on the ground. Kompany’s main problem will be that Costa will try to shift away from him and on to Martin Demichelis. 

Demichelis copes well in the air but he’s not as fast as Costa and Kompany may well stand nearer to his central defensive partner in order to help him out. The problem with that is it will mean there is space elswhere for others to exploit.

Chelsea must also put a lot of pressure on Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Ramires and Willian. If they can stop the supply to Costa, their lives will be a lot easier.
