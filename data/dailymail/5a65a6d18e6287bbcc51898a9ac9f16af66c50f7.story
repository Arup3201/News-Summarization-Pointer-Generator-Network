Paul McGrath found himself shouting in despair at the TV set - Manchester United had let in yet another soft goal. He tweeted: ‘Going to try to get myself fit and back into that defence!’

It was a tongue-in-cheek remark from the 54-year-old but how Louis van Gaal must wish for a player of McGrath’s calibre today. Indeed, so must half of the Premier League.

McGrath is widely revered as one of the greatest defenders to play the game. His United captain Bryan Robson described him as a ‘Rolls-Royce of a player’ who just happened to need a jump-start on occasions. 

These days, McGrath’s toughest opponent is the bottle. His much publicised battle with alcohol was described in all too harrowing detail in a candid autobiography, Back From The Brink.

The battle is ongoing but it is over a year since his last lapse and there is a sense of serenity in McGrath’s life.

'Roy is a very funny man and a good friend. I have huge respect for him as a fabulous footballer and a human being.

He was a pleasure to play alongside (with Ireland) because he made us a better team. He was born to be in football. 

His partnership with Martin O’Neill is working and I see a team spirit that, dare I say, reminds me of when I was part of the squad. I know Aston Villa and Ireland would be poorer if he wasn’t there.'

Home is now in picturesque Wexford in Ireland where ‘the fishing is good and golf not so bad’ and, despite the temptations placed in front of him by well-wishers, his focus is firmly set on United’s home match with Hull City on Saturday.

Buoyed by their win at Arsenal, McGrath believes it could prove the making of United’s painfully raw defence. ‘Let’s be honest, they got out of jail,’ he says in his Irish lilt. ‘At times against Arsenal it was like the Keystone Cops — they were hacking it clear when they should have been brave and passed it.

‘They were so nervous, but then I thought, “You’re doing the right thing, take no chances”. They sensed Arsenal had missed their opportunity. Young Paddy McNair relaxed and grew into the game and Chris Smalling seemed to relish the responsibility of being the senior defender. In the end, for a young defence, it should have done them a world of good.’

McGrath’s affection for his old club - where he played from 1982-89 - is clear. ‘I’d love to be playing,’ he says. ‘I used to enjoy games against Arsenal. They were the top team in the South and the way they used to strut around we didn’t much like. It was our other grudge match after Liverpool.

If you went in for a 50-50 it was important in our day to not show you were hurt. They called Stuart ‘Psycho’ and it was easy to see why. 

There was a 50-50 to be won at Wembley once - and it had to be him I was facing. When we collided the pain shot through my knee. I knew my knee was wrecked but I got up because I didn’t want to show it had hurt. It was killing me. I only hope he was sore, too, but he didn’t show it.

‘If you were going to win things you had to beat them and we were always looking to lay down a marker. That would normally come from Norman Whiteside. He wasn’t afraid of anyone and it wasn’t always about the football. He’d just hope it was in the vicinity when he was ready to tackle.

‘The physical nature, that competition, was all part of it. I loved it. Now when I say I’d like to play, I would but I’m not so sure I’d be on the pitch for long before I got a red card.’

As McGrath’s knees testify, he played in an era when tackling was expected and he cringes at the way football has become less of a contact sport. He believes this is partly to blame for many of the errors made by United’s defenders.

‘Tackling is being taken out of the game,’ he says. ‘The slightest touch on the back of a striker or clip of the heel and it’s a yellow card. It means the defender is worried about a red straight away. Now a defender has to stay on his feet and anticipate more than compete.'

Bobby Robson called McGrath a 'Rolls-Royce of a player' who needed an occasional jump start

‘I found that part of my game came as I got older. Being a good interceptor comes with age and experience. United’s players haven’t got that yet.

‘Old Trafford can be a horrible, unforgiving place to learn. When I see Tyler Blackett, he looks so smooth he could become a real gem but it’s whether they give him the leeway to develop. 

Everyone wants results now and pressure comes with that, which makes you nervous and leads to mistakes. I made countless mistakes but I was allowed to grow.’

United are searching for new defenders but McGrath believes a good one will be hard to find. ‘They need experience but there’s not many top-quality defenders that clubs will sell.

‘Vincent Kompany is a great leader, Mats Hummels is similar but United aren’t the only ones with money any more. It may be better to nurture Phil Jones, McNair, Blackett and Smalling because they can grow into better than what is in the market.

McGrath says young United defender Tyler Blackett 'looks so smooth he could become a real gem'

But he fears Blackett (right tracking Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) won't get the time he needs

‘They would hate me for saying it but Aston Villa have Ron Vlaar, who could help United with his experience and bring on the younger players but, at the same time, I want him to stay at Villa.’

John Fashanu of Wimbledon would smash my teeth in and others liked a tussle but Liverpool’s Ian Rush was horrible. He wouldn’t give you any peace. 

There was a time when goalkeepers would roll you the ball and you’d take a touch and try to look composed but Ian would come tearing at you with such speed you’d think, ‘Oh Lord, am I going to have time to take this touch?’

You’d be afraid he’d catch you and you’d make a mistake. Luckily, he never scored against me but it wasn’t comfortable.

United’s cause has been sorely hindered by injuries this season. The club once tried to persuade McGrath to retire at the age of 29 before he gained a new lease of life with the help of Villa physio Jim Walker and carried on playing until 37. He says modern footballers are not prepared to go through pain as much as players of his era.

‘There are too many advising players what to do and I think some have lost sight of who they are playing for. I remember Bryan Robson breaking his leg and he was itching to get back. In his first game, he went into a crunching 50-50 challenge full-blooded to test his leg. It was stupid in many ways but Bryan believed he was putting his body on the line for the club and fans who paid his wages.

‘I’m not sure you’d get that today. We wanted to play. We cared more about United than being injured.’

McGrath says there are too many people advising players these days and forgotten what they're playing for

McGrath’s appreciation of being a professional footballer was all the sweeter after an apprenticeship spent making iron gates. He was 22 when United picked him up - ‘I felt like the luckiest man in the world,’ he says.

The reverence in which he is held by the fans provides its own pitfalls, though. When McGrath goes to watch his beloved Ireland, he is often asked if he would like a drink.

‘I’m sure there are players with similar problems,’ he reasons. ‘That’s the boundaries in my life. I still have some good friends who ring when I need it, it’s one day at a time. It’s challenging but hopefully I’m winning.’

One thing certain about Paul McGrath, he is up for a challenge.
