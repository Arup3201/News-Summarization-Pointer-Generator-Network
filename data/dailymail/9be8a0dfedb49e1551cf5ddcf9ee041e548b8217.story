With viewing figures of almost 10million every week, there's no doubting the popularity of ITV's charming period drama Downton Abbey.

And it appears that we are so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of the 1920s characters that we are even starting to copy their wardrobes.

Sales of retro styles, including flapper dresses and demure ruffled blouses, are on the rise as we aspire to look like the immaculate ladies of the manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley.

Lady Sybil Crawley Lady Mary Crawley and Lady Edith Crawley are our new style icons as 1920s fashion gets a reprise

Figures from Littlewoods show that since the third series started sales of flapper style dresses have increased by 40%, traditional ruffle blouses shot up by 109% and even men are buying in to the trend with tweed and cord blazer sales rising a massive 146%.

And over half of those polled by the fashion brand said they would love to go back to the 1920s to sample life during this fashionable period.

Driving the trend are the elegant Crawley sisters with 39 per cent of women revealing that it is Lady Mary's 
look they most want to replicate.

The elaborate costumes and attention to historic detail are a key part of the period drama's charm

Mary was closely followed by her mother Lady Cora Crawley with 25 per cent of the vote and then her youngest sibling Lady Sybil with 23 per cent. 

1.     Southampton – 75% (increase in sales of 1920s inspired fashion)
2.     Luton – 73%
3.     Preston  – 71%
4.     Swansea  – 68%
5.     Bristol – 67%
6.     Edinburgh – 65%
7.     Reading –63%
8.     Norwich – 61%
9.     Preston – 59%
10.    Bournemouth – 56%

Devious Lady Edith only attracted 
12 per cent of women's style approval and perhaps more surprisingly flamboyantly
dressed newcomer American Martha Levinson received just 8 per cent of the vote.

Julie Donnelly, Head of Womenswear Buying at Littlewoods.com said: 'Women's clothing has always sold well at Littlewoods.com, when the seasons change, but in recent weeks we have seen a large increase in the number of women buying items which are inspired by the 1920s.

'It is great to see that such a popular TV show as Downton Abbey has the ability to alter the way women think about fashion and possibly introduce them to different styles they hadn't previously tried.

'It just goes to show how timeless fashion can be and we fully expect that this is a trend which will continue to grow and grow throughout the Autumn months as the series continues.'
