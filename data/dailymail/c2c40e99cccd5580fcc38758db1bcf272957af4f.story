Rapper Common led tributes to slain Missouri teen Michael Brown at the MTV Video Music Awards last night.

The star-studded audience in Los Angeles fell silent for five seconds in tribute to the 18-year-old aspiring rapper, two weeks after he was shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson.

A 15-second video clip set against a black-and-white image of Ferguson's city sign was also played with a crowd in the background chanting 'hand's up don't shoot' - the slogan used by protesters  in the St Louis suburb.

A 15-second video clip was also shown during the ceremony. A chant of 'hands up don't shoot' was heard in the background 

The footage included a quote from writer James Baldwin, which said: 'Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.' 

During the awards ceremony, Common told the audience: 'The people in the Ferguson...in St. Louis have used their voices to call for justice and change - to let everyone know that each and every one of our lives matters.'

In the moment of quiet that followed, artists including Snoop Dogg bowed their heads and closed their eyes before the performance carried on. 

MTV President Stephen Friedman confirmed on Sunday the network would air a 15-second spot focusing on race in a bid to continue the discussion about events surrounding the shooting.

'It's a call to action to our audience that we have to confront our own bias head-on before we can truly create change,' Friedman said.

The protests in the St Louis suburb have become more peaceful after the National Guard was withdrawn 

'Hip-hop has always been about truth and has been a powerful instrument for social change,' he told the audience, before leading them in five seconds of silence then announcing the nominees for best hip hop video. 

Brown, who was gunned down by police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, will be buried today during a public funeral at a St Louis Church.

Micheal Brown Snr has called for a 'day of silence' and 'peace' today as his son is laid to rest more than two weeks after his death.

The teen instantly became a symbol of racial injustice as protesters flooded into the streets of the predominantly black community in response.

There is still a police presence in the suburb, but clashes have eased over the last few days

It revived long simmering questions about police treatment of minorities across the country. 

The National Guard was called in to try to ease the tensions while the federal government has also opened an investigation into the shooting. 

The Rev Al Shrapton, who led a Peace Fest in Ferguson yesterday, added to the plea from the boy's father.

He said: 'We don't want anything to happen that might defile the name of Michael Brown,' Sharpton said. 'This is not about our rage tomorrow. It's about the legacy and memory of his son.' 

The parents of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin also spoke, urging the crowd to channel its anger into action by pushing to strengthen families and better educate youth and expressing support for the Brown family and the people of the St. Louis area. 

'We're going to stand tall with you all,' Trayvon's Martin's father, Tracy Martin, said. 

Trayvon Martin, 17, was also unarmed when he was shot and killed in 2012. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he shot Martin in self-defense, was acquitted.

The nightly protests in Ferguson have been mostly peaceful in recent days, a contrast to images of police in riot gear firing tear gas canisters at angry protesters in the days after the Brown shooting. 

Details released by law enforcement have said that Brown was involved in a scuffle with Officer Wilson after he was asked to move and pushed him against his patrol car.  

Some witnesses have reported seeing Brown's arms in the air — an act of surrender. An autopsy concluded he'd been shot at least six times. 

Ferguson police identified Wilson at the same time they released a video of an alleged theft showing Brown snatch some cigars in a convenience store just minutes before he was killed. 

In the video, Brown is shown grabbing a clerk by the shirt and forcefully pushing him into a display rack.
