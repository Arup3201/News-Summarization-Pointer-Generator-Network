A million parcels are believed to be stuck in depots across the UK after courier firm City Link went into administration over Christmas.

City Link has stopped taking any new deliveries and told customers they would have to use the online tracker system to work out where their parcel is and then collect it themselves.

More than 3,700 jobs are believed to be in danger after administrators Ernst & Young failed to find a new buyer.

A million parcels are believed to be stuck in depots across the UK after courier firm City Link went into administration over Christmas

The courier company has suffered from poor systems and an overcrowded market in recent years, due to the rise in online shopping.

Customers who placed parcels with City Link on Christmas Eve for delivery have been urged to go to the depot to retrieve their parcels 'as soon as possible'.

A statement on City Link's website said: 'The business has ceased to accept new parcels from customers and its depots will remain open for a short period of time to enable customers or intended recipients to collect parcels.

'Those customers who placed parcels with City Link on Christmas Eve for delivery are urged to go to the depot to retrieve their parcels as soon as possible.

'Any intended recipients who have been notified of a failed delivery are also urged to go to the depot to collect their parcel as soon as possible.

'The depots will reopen following the Christmas holiday break on Monday 29 December 2014 to enable parties to collect parcels.

'City Link will no longer be able to deliver any further parcels and customers are urged to make alternative arrangements for future deliveries.

'The online system to access parcel tracking and therefore check on the whereabouts of your parcel is still live and should be used to identify if you need to collect your parcel and where it is located.' 

Bosses at the troubled firm were branded 'cowards' after workers only discovered their jobs were at risk via news reports on Christmas Day revealing the business had gone into administration. 

Hunter Kelly, joint administrator to City Link, said the company has incurred substantial losses over several years.

'These losses reflect a combination of intense competition in the sector, changing customer and parcel recipient preferences, and difficulties for the company in reducing its cost base,' he said.

'The strain of these losses became too great and all but used up Better Capital's £40 million investment, which was made in 2013 and intended to help to turn around the company.

Union officials have been holding talks with administrators to try to save employees' jobs. 

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT's objective now is to do everything we can to rescue jobs in the wake of the shock collapse into administration of City Link on Christmas Day. 

'Despite the festive season there can be no delays in getting on with the rescue programme and we expect the Government through Vince Cable to take an active role right now. The thousands of workers caught in the middle of this crisis deserve full support from every quarter.'

The union has demanded 'urgent talks' with Business Secretary Mr Cable and said it is disappointed the minister will not meet them until the new year.

Retailers who used City Link, such as John Lewis and Amazon, have had to take emergency measures to ensure the delivery of parcels. 

Roger Sumner-Rivers, founder of London-based firm ParcelHero, said the firm's closure could have a major impact on the UK parcel market. 

He said there were now 'serious concerns as to how the carriers left in the market are going to be able to absorb the estimated 76 million additional parcels City Link delivered each year'.

'The companies will all require immediate service, which will put a huge burden on every carrier's infrastructure, from the sales department right through the network to the delivery couriers at the other end,' he added.
