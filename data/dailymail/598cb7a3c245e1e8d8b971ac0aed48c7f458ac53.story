Liu Fei loves devouring live snakes - especially through his nose.

Born in the Jiangxi mountains in China, the serpent swallower learned the nausea-inducing skill following being accidentally bitten by a snake as a child.

And today, he's a 'snake master,' worshiped by many community members.  

Liu Fei, a man born in the Jiangxi mountains in China, practices the art of serpent swallowing

In the video, which is only suitable for those with a strong stomach, the man begins by taking out a white rubbish bag filled to the top with slithering snakes.

After removing two of them, Fei demonstrates how to insert the serpents into his nose - and pull them out through his mouth. 

For his second stunt, he swallowed a snake whole, before pulling it back out of his throat.

In the video, which is not for the faint of heart, Fei also demonstrates swallowing the snake whole

Fei's fascination with snakes began after being bitten by one as a child - and meeting a local snake expert

Fei has long been fascinated by snakes, after growing up in the mountains where spotting the animals was quite common.

When he was 12-years-old, he was playing outside when he was accidentally bitten by a snake in the grass - without being aware of what it was!

After going home and showing his parents, the young boy was invited to meet a local snake expert to learn more about how to treat such a bite - and thus inspired his lifelong interest.
