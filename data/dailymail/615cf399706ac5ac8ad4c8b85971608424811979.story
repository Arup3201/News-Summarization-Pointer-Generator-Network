Middle class people will dominate the world in 20 years, a major US government report said yesterday.

It said the number of people who can count themselves as middle income will treble to three billion and the number of people living in poverty will halve.

But the report warned that the increased consumption of millions of newly enriched middle class people may strain resources, including food and water, unless innovation and peace allow rising demand to be met.

Overpowering: By 2030, China and India will replace the US and EU in terms of power, a study claims

Growing: The harbour city of Shanghai has a population of over 18 million people; the report says that people will be competing for resources in 2030

Inevitability: The study predicts that China and India will hold the most power in coming years, while the US and EU have been on a steady decline

Other perspective: Any way the power index falls, developing states will overtake developed states

Consumption: By 2030, India and China's middle class will rise to become major consumers, taking more resources

The report, 
published by the National Intelligence Council, suggested that the 
economies of China, India and Brazil will generate the new middle class,
who will produce better education standards, better health, and the 
advance of women into greater wealth and power.

It added: 
‘Individual empowerment will accelerate substantially owing to poverty 
reduction and a huge growth of the global middle class.

‘For the first 
time, a majority of the world’s population will not be impoverished, and
the middle classes will be the most important social and economic 
sector in the vast majority of countries around the world. Demand for 
consumer goods, including cars, (will) rise sharply with the growth of 
the middle class.’

The new middle class will be mostly 
urban, with nearly two-thirds of the world's population will live in 
cities by 2030, with the majority of people connected by technology, 
protected by advanced health care and linked by countries that work 
together, perhaps with the United States and China cooperating to lead 
the way.

That's the best case scenario in a 
report, Global Trends 2030, released Monday by the U.S. government's 
National Intelligence Council.

In
the worst case scenarios, rising population leads to conflict over 
water and food, especially in the Mideast and Africa, and the 
instability contributes to global economic collapse.

The study is the intelligence community's analysis of where current trends will take the world in the next 15 to 20 years, intended to help policymakers plan for the best and worst possible futures to come.

The report is broken down into what the National Intelligence Council calls megatrends that are likely to occur and game-changers — the what-if's that are less certain but would be so significant that they can't be ignored.

Among the major trends: the rise of a global middle class that is better educated, connected via technology and healthier due to advances in medicine. Power will no longer reside with one or two key nations, but be spread across networks and coalitions of countries working together.

In countries where there are declining birth rates and an aging population like the U.S., economic growth may slow. Sixty percent of the world's population will live in cities.

Yet even with these advances, food, water and energy will be more scarce.

'Nearly
half of the world's population will live in areas experiencing severe 
water stress,' the report said. Africa and the Middle East will be most 
at risk of food and water shortages, but China and India also 
vulnerable.

Among the 
anticipated crises is the worry of global economic collapse, fighting 
among nations that don't adapt rapidly enough to change and the possible
spillover of instability in the Mideast and South Asia to the rest of 
the world.

Technology is seen as a potential savior to head off some of this conflict, boosting economic productivity to keep pockets filled despite rising population, rapid growth of cities and climate change.The report outlines several 'Potential Worlds' for 2030.

Under the heading 'Stalled Engines', otherwise known as the 'most plausible worst-case scenario, the risks of interstate conflict increase,' the report said.

'The U.S. draws inward and globalization stalls.'

In the most plausible best-case outcome, called 'Fusion,' the report said, 'China and the U.S. collaborate on a range of issues, leading to broader global cooperation.'

And under another heading, the report describes a world where 'inequalities explode as some countries become big winners and others fail. ... Without completely disengaging, the U.S. is no longer the 'global policeman.''

Trending: India is part of a global trend that is advancing towards an increasing urbanization, according to which more than half of the world's population is living in towns and cities

Consumers: An Indian customer looks at a product on sale at a retail shop in Mumbai, India; the middle class in the country will grow exponentially by 2030 and will consume much of the world's goods

The report warns of the mostly catastrophic effect of possible 'Black Swans,' extraordinary events that can change the course of history.

These include a severe pandemic that could kill millions in a matter of months and more rapid climate change that could make it hard to feed the world's population.

Two positive events are also listed, including 'a democratic China or a reformed Iran,' which could bring more global stability.

One bright spot for the U.S. is energy independence.

'With shale gas, the U.S. will have sufficient natural gas to meet domestic needs and generate potential global exports for decades to come,' the report said.
