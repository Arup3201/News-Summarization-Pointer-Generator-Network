Killer: Joshua Malmgren, 33, of Lower Township, New Jersey received an 18 year sentence

A drunk driver who  killed two teenage girls after he took his eyes off the road to text  branded himself a 'monster' when he was sentenced to  18 years in prison.

Joshua Malmgren, 33, of Lower Township, New Jersey received a nine-year sentence for each victim. 

He pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in September The Press of Atlantic City reports.

'I am a monster. I am so lost,' he said after expressing remorse.

In July 2012, Malmgren was driving on Bayshore Road in the Del Haven section of Middle Township around 9:16 p.m. when his sport-utility vehicle drifted off the road and struck the two girls.

He killed Nioami Lazicki-Gaston, 15, of Middle Township and Ashley Dauber, 13 of Philadelphia, who were walking to get ice cream.

He narrowly missed Gaston's 14-year-old sister, Farrahanne Gaston.

After the accident he quickly stopped and called 911. 

However, both girls died at the scene. 

Police said he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.18, or more than twice the state's legal limit. And friends said he had driven to a liquor store three times earlier that day to buy beer and Sambuca.

He was also taking prescription pain medicine for a broken left arm that exacerbated the effects of the alcohol, according to court records. 

Yet when two of his friends noticed that he was intoxicated and offered him a ride home he refused.

The sentencing hearing began with a video slideshow that showed family photos of the victims, accompanied by music from performers including Eric Clapton and Guns n' Roses.

First Assistant Prosecutor Rob Johnson said Malmgren was texting when he took his eyes off the road. 

The prosecutor asked the judge to give him a heavy sentence to warn  others not to drink, drive and text.

The court room was full of the family of the teenage girls. At the start of the hearing, the girls’ teenage faces stared back at the defendant from twin easels.

Their families told how Gaston would have been a senior this year at Cape May County Technical High School where she was planning to study criminal justice. 

Gaston's distraught sister read an essay to the court that her sister wrote before her death about the love she felt for her family.   

Dauber’s sister, Kaitlyn Dauber, told Malmgren: 'I won’t be able to hear her voice again. I won’t be able to do her hair on her wedding day. I miss her so much.'

His actions have devastated the Gaston family.

Bill Gaston said: 'Nioami was always more worried about others than herself. Sometimes, I swear I can hear her tell me it’s OK. The pain that rests in our hearts is just as heavy today.'

Court staff handed out three boxes of tissues to family members who sobbed throughout the hearing.

The defendant was also in tears. 

Before the accident, Malmgren had been assistant manager of a convenience store. He also had custody of his two children, including a disabled child. 

The crash was his first DWI, but he did have an assault charge as a juvenile.

Nioami's sister, Farrahanne Gaston, told Malmgren that she forgave him.

'I forgive you not because you deserve it, but because I deserve peace,' she said.
