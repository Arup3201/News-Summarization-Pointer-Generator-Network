Warning: French President Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to bring back passports checks for all EU citizens unless other countries take tougher measures against illegal immigrants

Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to bring back passport checks for all EU citizens entering France if member countries fail to seal their borders against illegal immigrants.

The French president named Greece as a key culprit allowing asylum seekers to flood across its ‘unguarded frontier’ with Turkey.

He set a one-year deadline for EU nations to tighten security before France pulls out of the Schengen Agreement that allows free travel between 25 countries.

He said yesterday: ‘There are 120km between Greece and Turkey which are not guarded.

‘I am within my rights to demand what the sanctions should be. I give one year for this practice to change, otherwise we suspend our membership of the Schengen Agreement.

‘As it is France which has the most generous welfare benefits, we are the ones most affected by putting these measures into place properly.’

Mr Sarkozy’s increasingly tough stance on immigration is seen as an attempt to win over voters of the extremist National Front party as he falls behind socialist rival Francois Hollande in the polls for this month’s presidential election.

His remarks come a month after he said tightening border security was the only way to avoid ‘the implosion of Europe’.

Mr Sarkozy told an election rally in March: ‘Unchecked immigration thwarts Europe’s ability to take in and integrate new entrants and puts strains on social safety nets for the most disadvantaged across the continent.’

Right of passage: German police officers wave EU flags after the border station with the Czech Republic is closed in 2007 following the Schengen agreement, which allows free travel between 25 countries

The UK did not sign up to the Schengen Agreement and Britons still need a passport to visit France.

But any changes would mean passport checks for all European and non-EU travellers arriving in France.

Mr Sarkozy also warned yesterday that France would impose its own barriers to cheap non-EU imported goods unless trade protection regulations were tightened.
