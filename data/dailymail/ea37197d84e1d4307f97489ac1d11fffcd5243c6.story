Busted: Stephen A. Coronel, 63, was arrested on five counts of 'sexual exploitation of  a minor'

A South Carolina guitarist and former KISS songwriter was arrested and charged with child pornography on Friday.

Stephen A. Coronel, 63, of Bluffton, former member of Wicked Lester -- the rock and roll band that preceded KISS -- was arrested for 'sexual exploitation of a minor,' according to a Beaufort County arrest report.  

Authorities say that Coronel was arrested with five counts of the sexual exploitation after a search of his Plantation Point apartment. 

Sgt. Robin McIntosh of the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office told the Charlotte Observer that deputies seized evidence and a number of electronic devices from Coronel's home.

The investigation reportedly began when the U.S. Department of Justice's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force determined that child pornography had been uploaded from a Bluffton home.

The material was tracked to Coronel's computer.

Authorities report that no other details about the investigation or case have been revealed. 

In 1971, Coronel worked alongside KISS's Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Ultimate Classic Rock  reports that the band's only album was rejected by Epic Records. However, many of its songs appeared on KISS albums. 

Nearly 15 years later, Coronel holds on to his KISS claim-to-fame by referring to himself on his Facebook profile as a 'KISS-Multi-Platinum Songwriter.' 

UCR reports that Coronel received credit for co-songwriting early KISS classics such as 'Goin' Blind which appeared on their 1974 album 'Hotter Than Hell' and 'She' which appeared on the 1975 album 'Dressed to Kill.'
