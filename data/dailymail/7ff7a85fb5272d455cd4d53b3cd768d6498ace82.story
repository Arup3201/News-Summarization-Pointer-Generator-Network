A smartly-dressed couple had 'noisy' sex in the female toilets of a McDonald’s packed with families and children at teatime, an outraged mother of two revealed today.

The 42-year-old witness, who wished to remain anonymous, had been at the Galleria branch of the chain in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, with her 10-year-old son and 22-year-old daughter last Thursday.

Horrified mothers and young girls found the couple, thought to be in their late 30s, in the toilets at around 5:30pm, before they were asked to leave the crowded family restaurant by security guards.

Location: A 42-year-old woman, who wished to remain anonymous, had been at the Galleria branch of the chain in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, with her 10-year-old son and 22-year-old daughter when she heard the couple

She said ‘They should be absolutely disgusted with themselves, doing it in McDonald’s of all places.

‘It’s a kids’ restaurant for heaven’s sake! If it had been an adult restaurant it wouldn’t have been so bad. They should be named and shamed. It’s a disgrace.’

The family were eating at a table near the toilets when the couple walked into the chain smiling.

‘They were suited and booted,’ the mother said. ‘The lady was in a skirt suit and the man was in a suit as well. They looked maybe late-30s, not even young - old enough to know better anyway.

‘People who had gone in started coming back from the toilet with a horrified look on their faces,’ she said. ‘My daughter then went herself. She told me that they were at it on the floor.'

She said her daughter told her all she could hear in the toilets was the couple having noisy sex.

The mother told the McDonald’s manager, who alerted their security guards and the couple were escorted straight outside. ‘It was a bit of a shocker to say the least,’ she said.

Witness

A Galleria shopping centre spokesman confirmed they had promptly removed the couple and passed the incident onto police.

A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that a couple were found behaving inappropriately in our toilets.

'As a family restaurant, we take this very seriously and the couple were immediately asked to leave by our security team. Our security team acted immediately and the couple left straight away.’
