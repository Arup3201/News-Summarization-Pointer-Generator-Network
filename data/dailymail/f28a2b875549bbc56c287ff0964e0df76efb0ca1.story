A plumber was almost blinded in a freak accident after a garage door flew into his face and left him with a shattered cheekbone.

Lee Collins was carrying out chores at his home in Burnley, Lancashire when he accidentally knocked the heavy metal door out of place.

The bar which runs across the door smashed into his face, shattering his eye socket and fracturing his jaw.

But Mr Collins, a former rugby player, says the accident could have been much worse - if the square corner of the door had hit him, he could have lost the sight in his eye.

The 42-year-old had to have two metal plates inserted into his face to avoid permanently damaging his facial structure.

He endured two hours of reconstructive surgery at Royal Blackburn Hospital after the accident earlier this month.

'I had gone 
into the garage and was bending down to pick something up when I must 
have knocked the arm out of place,' Mr Collins said.

'I didn't even manage to pick up what I had bent down to get, when I was hit on the right side of my face with the metal bar.

'As soon as I did it happened I knew that it had caused some serious damage - I looked in the mirror about 30 seconds after and that side of my face had just completely swollen up.

'When my wife saw my face she went into a blind panic. Even though I'm annoyed that it happened, I do feel that I was actually lucky that it wasn't a lot worse than it was.

'I was hit with the middle part of the bar, but if it had been the square end of the bar which had hit me then I would have most likely lost my eye.'

After going to A&E, Mr Collins underwent a scan on his face which revealed that the damage to his face was worse than initially thought.

He added: 'After the accident I went to see an eye specialist and luckily my eye is OK and I didn't need any treatment.

'The scan I had showed that the injuries below the skin were a lot worse than what they thought from looking at my face, and there was a lot of trapped nerve and muscle damage.

'During the week pain was gradually getting worse. It was extremely painful. Now I have had the operation the pain has eased slightly but I'm still struggling to eat.'
