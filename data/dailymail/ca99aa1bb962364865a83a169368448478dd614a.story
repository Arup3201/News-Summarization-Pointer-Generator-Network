It was custom built as a dream home for a property developer.

But this luxury house, which is on the market for £4million, looks more like something out of the Great Gatsby.

High Oak, a magnificent, five-bedroom in Hockley, Essex, boasts a jaw-dropping reception hall with twin staircases which look fit for a Hollywood starlet to descend down.

High Oak, in Hockley, Essex is on the market for £4million. This five-bedroom mansion, owned by a property developer, boasts a twin staircase in the reception hall, as well as a wine cellar, swimming pool and games room

The house, located on an affluent road in a leafy suburb, is set in 1.4 acres of landscaped gardens and grounds. The mansion has eight reception rooms on the ground floor and a suntrap terrace, complete with a swimming pool

The mansion's swimming pool sits on a first floor semi-circular suntrap terrace, complete with a kitchen and bathroom especially for the pool. Any buyer would be able to enjoy views across the gardens, through woodland and open countryside, while having a swim

The 14,000sq ft home, set on a leafy surburban road, comes complete with 1.4 acres of land, a soundproof cinema room, a wine cellar and a pool and a gym.

The property is owned by Neil Ryan, a property developer who runs Neil Ryan Bespoke Homes. Mr Ryan designs bespoke homes for other wealthy homeowners, many of whom are based in London.

Mr Ryan bought the plot for £900,000 in April 2006, but demolished the old house on the site to make way for his beautiful mansion.

Two years later, the house was finished, complete with eight reception room, a spectacular lounge, a wine cellar, two studies and a home cinema.

The first floor, set on a galleried landing with a vaulted and domed ceiling, also includes five bedroom suites, each with a dressing room and en-suite bathroom.

From the landing, there is also access to a first-floor sun terrace with a swimming pool, which looks over the landscaped gardens and the countryside beyond.

There is also a pool kitchen and pool bathroom on the terrace, to save bathers traipsing through the house.

High Oak, which covers 14,000sq feet, has its own air-conditioned and soundproof cinema, fitted with upholstered padded fabric walls, fitted seats and a surround-sound system, with large projector screen that is
linked to DVD and Sky

The newly-fitted kitchen and breakfast room boasts hand-painted solid walnut units, as well as top of the range kitchen appliances

The stunning lounge, complete with chandeliers, is part of the mansion in Hockley, which is on the market. It was bought by Neil Ryan for £900,000 in April 2006 which means the owners could pocket £3.1million if it is sold for the asking price

John Seward, estate agent at
 Strutt & Parker in Chelmsford, which is marketing the house, said 
there had been a lot of interest and there were second viewings lined 
up.

He
 said: 'The owner builds bespoke properties, mainly for people in London, and this is what he did 
here, for himself. Some of the rooms have never been lived in - it's that new.'

Chartered
 Surveyor Robert Burns, from Tillett Burns & Hughes Chartered 
Surveyors in Basildon, said: 'These types of multi-million pound houses 
are really within a property sector of their own.

'They are not bought by people who need to get a mortgage and buyers would travel UK-wide for these unique properties, not just within counties.

'You may also find that houses in the surrounding area of an individual mansion may also go up in value.'

This reception room overlooks the mansion's gardens. There is also under-floor heating throughout the property, as well as air conditioning in the bedrooms, cinema and gym

In the basement of the mansion, the owners have built a large wine cellar
