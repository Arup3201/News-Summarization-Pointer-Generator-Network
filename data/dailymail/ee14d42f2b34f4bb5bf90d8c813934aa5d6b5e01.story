A 27-year-old champion netball player, who was due to marry her beloved fiance later this year, has died after suffering a fatal heart attack during a match.

Beth Leske, who excelled in the sport from a young age, died while playing a club match on Saturday when she suddenly collapsed on the courts at Fred Finch Park at Berkeley, near Wollongong.

Leaving behind soon-to-be wed fiance Chris Hendry and a young son, Tarne, Illawarra Districts Netball Association president Dianne Elvy told Daily Mail Australia Beth's family was 'shocked and saddened' by her sudden death.

Two off-duty paramedics rushed to her side to perform CPR about 2pm, before she was rushed to a Wollongong hospital where she later died.

Ms Elvy told Daily Mail Australia the bride-to-be was a 'valued member' of Illawarra netball.

'Beth was a valued member of the association who played for her club for a few years,' she said.

She said her understanding of the incident was that it 'all happened very quickly.'

'I think it all happened very quickly, but as far as details regarding how I couldn't say exactly because I wasn't there.'

She said the family, including the man she was due to marry later this year and her young son, are in shock.

'They are sad, upset and they are all grieving for Beth.'

It is unknown what exactly caused her death or whether she had a pre-existing medical condition.
