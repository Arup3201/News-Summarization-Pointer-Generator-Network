Two glamorous Australian socialites who escaped conviction for a 'cat fight' alleged to have taken place over stolen fashion accessories have taken to social media to voice - and sing - their relief.

Gabriela Cevallos, a 30-year-old bikini model whose Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts are full of images of her clad in racy lingerie and straddling office chairs was found not guilty of assault.

Her friend Bethany Heagney, 28, who describes herself as a Mormon, was also cleared when they appeared at Sydney's Downing Centre local court on Monday.

Cringeworthy: The two best friends published a mocking rap video hours after their not guilty verdict

Their lengthy legal battle ended when magistrate Michael Barko found they acted in self-defence against former friend Jasmin Keomanivong outside a waterfront Sydney restaurant on May 5, 2012.

Ms Keomanivong told police she was punched, kicked and had her hair pulled by the two dazzling best friends at the end of a fashion parade. 

But Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported magistrate Barko found the defendants to be 'more reliable and credible witnesses' and found the pair not guilty of three charges each.

Within hours Ms Cevallos was on Instagram posting messages of joy and even taking digs at her would-be victim.

'THANK YOU! So happy with today's outcome. Also grateful to all my friends & family who have been there to support me @bethany_instagram #rideordie ...and all I have to say to Jasmine is #BYEFELICIA' she wrote alongside a picture of the quote 'Today I am thankful'.

Friend and co-accused Bethany wrote 'Yes!!!' under the image before posting an video of the two driving around the streets of Sydney while rapping, making 'V' for victory signs with their fingers and cheering 'we made it baby'.

Colourful past: Bethany Heagney, who describes herself as a Mormon, once dated a convicted killer

The film clip - which shows Ms Cevallos sitting behind the wheel - was posted late on Monday night alongside the hashtags '#WeWon!' and '#YeahWeDid'.

The brunette is a former girlfriend of South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league star Sam Burgess.

Bethany Heagney used to date twice-convicted killer Mustapha Dib. She told the court earlier: 'I was punched to the face ... I punched (Jasmin) back, I thought she was going to keep hitting me.'

She also said Ms Keomanivong was being intimidating towards her best friend.

'I'm really relieved, the truth's come out, our name's been cleared, it's good,' she told Channel 7 after Monday's not guilty verdict.

The trial has been the talk of the Sydney media and a source of gossip for the city's social circles for two years with the girls making headlines repeatedly for turning up to court in designer clothes and clutching Chanel handbags.

New South Wales police didn't lay charges until three months after the bizarre fashion parade bust-up took place.

During the trial it was found that the alleged victim's statements to investigators were riddled with errors.

Summing up the real life courtroom drama, Ms Cevallos told her more than 40,000 Instagram followers: 'After 2 years of being accused of some serious allegations our names have finally been cleared.'

Ms Cevallos, of Waterloo in Sydney's inner south, is listed as the owner of Mero Mero, a health food shop described online as 'a rapidly growing healthy fast food franchise business based in Australia, conceptualised to combat Australiaâ€™s growing obesity problem.'

She formerly hosted shows on Australian pay TV network Fuel.

Ms Heagney, a resident of the Sutherland Shire, is a mother-of-two and former marketing manager.

When her then partner Mustapha Dib was jailed in 2012 for the  murder of pregnant woman Anita Vrzina she wrote on Facebook: 'I love you, I miss you so much baby.'

It is understood she is now married to another man.
