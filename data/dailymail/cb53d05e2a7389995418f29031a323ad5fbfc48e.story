Daredevil tourists have a thrilling new ride to add to their bucket lists - the longest   rollercoaster zip line ride in the world.

The nearly one-mile long attraction, which opened last Sunday, whizzes, dips and dives through the Ourimbah State Forest at TreeTop Adventure Park in Central Coast, Australia.

The rollercoaster, called Crazy Rider Xtreme, starts 60ft above ground then zigzags through 40 obstacles, around 360-degree loops and in and out of 40 slaloms.

Longest rollercoaster zip line: Crazy Rider Xtreme opened last Sunday and is nearly a mile long

Hold on tight: The five-minute ride starts 60ft above ground and then zigzags through 40 obstacles

It's also the country's first tree-based rollercoaster zip line.

The marathon ride takes five minutes to complete and is three times as long as any other curved zip wire, surpassing Forever Florida in the US which previously held the title.

The TreeTop Adventure Park website says: 'Combining the thrill and suspense of a rollercoaster with the flying sensations of zip lines, the Crazy Rider is an exhilarating experience open to a large range of age and abilities.'

No getting off: The attraction is three times as long as any other curved  rollercoaster zip wire

'It is not really about the speed but more about gravity, especially in the turns. The acceleration and deceleration is what makes the ride thrilling,' Sandrine Gaymard, the owner of the park, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Zip lines usually travel in a straight line but we thought it would be incredible to build some to go around the trees, up and down, and even with 360-degree loops to really ramp up the fun factor,' she said.

The TreeTop Adventure Park has a shorter tree-based zip line that is 330m long

If you want to try something a little less heart racing, you can strap into the Pioneer zip line at the same site, which is nearly 1,100ft long.

Sophisticated high-wire technology developed by the park owners and tree-ride maker Ecoline means the attractions allow trees to grow around them unrestricted.

An independent arborist is also employed to monitor the health of the trees.

There are moments when the ride speeds up and others when it slows down to let riders enjoy the views 

Bird's eye view: One reviewer described the experience as 'heart in mouth' and a 'monumental achievement'

One online reviewer, 'Scott from Central Coast', wrote: 'Crazy Rider is a monumental achievement for the Central Coast. Twists, turns, heart in your mouth moments all interspersed with cruisey sections and squeals of joy.'

While it's the longest rollercoaster zip line, Crazy Rider certainly isn't the longest zip line in the world.

That honour goes to Italy's 1.3-mile-long Volo dell'Angelo (the Angel Flight) which travels in a straight line at speeds of up to 74 miles per hour and is said to be the world's highest continuous zip wire as well.

Eye of the Jaguar, in Peru's Sacred Valley, is almost as long and reaches speeds of up to 68 miles per hour.

Zip World, at Penrhyn Quarry in Bethesda, North Wales,  has the Big Zipper, which can reach 100 miles per hour over a distance of more than a mile.
