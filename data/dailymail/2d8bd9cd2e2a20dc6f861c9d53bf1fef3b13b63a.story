Britain has overtaken Germany to become the biggest market in Europe for Ferraris.

A record 677 of the luxury sports cars were purchased by UK buyers last year, an increase of five percent on 2012.

The UK is now the second largest market globally for the luxury Italian cars behind American, but ahead of Germany where there were 652 deliveries, down 100 on the previous year.

Hike: A record 677 of the luxury sports cars were purchased by UK buyers last year, an increase of five percent on 2012

Wealthy British motorists now account for one in every ten new Ferraris sold worldwide.

The strength of sales here partly reflects London’s status as a haven for the world’s super-wealthy and the persistence of high pay in the City.

The new California T convertible, which will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show next month, is considered an ‘entry-level’ car with prices starting from around £155,000 on the road.

It has a 3.8-litre turbo V8 engine, does around 29 miles to the gallon, can accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.6 seconds and has a top speed of 198mph.

But prices can rise into the millions of pounds for one-off models made to customers’ own specifications.

British celebrity owners include Simon Cowell, who has a silver Ferrari 458 Italia that cost around £175,000 and is so exclusive there is a three year waiting list for deliveries.

Others including rock star Eric Clapton and chef Gordon Ramsay are fans, along with scores of anonymous bankers with bonuses burning a hole in the pocket of their Savile Row suits.

However, according to Enrico Galliera, commercial director, the main reason the UK has become the Ferrari capital of Europe is that Germany has been flooded with second hand sports cars from Italy, following a tax clampdown on the rich by the Rome authorities.

That meant the Germans bought fewer new sports cars. As a result, Germany slipped into second place in the European Ferrari-buying league table.

Police in crisis-hit Italy have been swooping on sports-car drivers in fashionable parts of Rome and Milan as well as in resorts such as Portofino in the Italian Riviera and passing details to the tax authorities in a bid to root out tax evaders.

Tax agents also hunted down the owners of luxury yachts whose payments did not chime with their lavish lifestyles. Ferrari now considers its home market of Italy, which now accounts for just 3percent of its global sales, as ‘marginal’.

‘Owners of luxury cars as well as the owners of yachts are being questioned by the fiscal police, and made to feel uncomfortable,’ Galliera said.

‘The mood is not particularly favourable to the luxury car, which is funny for a country like Italy where luxury is one of the things we do best.’

He added that the main reason for strong sales in Britain is not City bonuses, but that the UK is a nation of petrol-heads. ‘The UK is the country where there is the highest passion about sports cars.’

‘The California is very successful because it is very sporty with an elegant line. It is a car that can be used every day, that is less flashy and extreme.’

The United States is the world’s biggest market for Ferraris, with a record 2,035 delivered there last year, an increase of nine per cent.

Ferrari was yesterday named the world’s most powerful brand in the annual Brand Finance survey.

Its worldwide revenues for 2013 rose five per cent to just under £2 billion, while profits rose 5.4percent to £205m, following a decision to limit the number of cars to 7,000 to ‘maintain exclusivity.’
