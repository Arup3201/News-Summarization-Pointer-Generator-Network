Unconscious and bleeding: Anthony Owen was found having sustained fatal head injuries yards from his home in Cheshire

The family of a cancer surgeon who died after being punched by a 16-year-old yob spoke last night of their shock that his killer will never face justice.

An open verdict was recorded yesterday at an inquest into the death of Anthony Owen, 68, who was found sprawled outside his £750,000 home with fatal head injuries.

But Cheshire coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said the evidence of the teenager who claimed he punched the regular churchgoer in self-defence after being shouted at was ‘evasive’.

Mr Rheinberg added that there was ‘no substantial proof as to the means by which Mr Owen met his death’, but it was ‘totally out of character for Mr Owen to show anger, let alone strike out at someone’.

The teenager had been charged with manslaughter but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case last year.

Without any witnesses, lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction.

The Daily Mail can reveal that evidence from the boy’s headmaster, which was presented to the coroner but not made public, revealed that the boy ‘didn’t like being challenged by authority’.

Now aged 17, and a student mechanic, he had only been at the school for around four months but was suspended at the time of the attack.

Yesterday Mr Owen’s brother Eoaghan, 57, himself a retired surgeon from Horsham, West Sussex, said they had been left ‘disappointed’ by the justice system and would lodge complaints with the police and CPS for their handling of the case.

‘We were appalled, shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic circumstances of Anthony’s death,’ he said.

‘My brother has been let down by the justice system and that boy has effectively got away scot-free. We are disappointed nobody will face justice.

‘The coroner has basically said he didn’t know how Anthony died, but we do know that if he hadn’t encountered that boy on that night Anthony would still be here today.

The CPS said that because they had no witnesses to corroborate what the boy had said – my brother was dead, he was the silent witness – they had no chance of getting a conviction, but that effectively denied us justice.

Mr Owen, who never married, was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his death.

‘I do not object to anyone having a defence, but it is wrong that that defence has never been challenged or put to a jury.

The CPS had the uncorroborated testimony of a thug against the conduct of a professional man who worked all his life caring for others.

‘Anthony was a pillar of society and a devout Roman Catholic who lived a blameless life. There is no evidence that my brother ever attacked anyone. It is totally inconsistent with his reputation.

'A jury should have been given the chance to decide what was the truth in court.’

Mr Owen’s sister, solicitor Alison Baverstock, 63, of Bournemouth, added: ‘We feel very let down.’

Warrington coroner’s court heard that the incident involving Anthony Owen and the teenager happened last March in the prosperous Cheshire village of Hale, near Widnes, where the surgeon had been picking up litter from the grass verge next to his thatched home.

The boy, who was riding a BMX bike and
was with two friends, said he punched Mr Owen after the surgeon began 
shouting at him for having no lights on his bike.

Mr Owen was found on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later.

The
boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested but the CPS 
dropped the charge of manslaughter after a pathologist’s report 
supported his claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self-defence.

Pathologist
Dr Christopher Johnson told the inquest he believed the cause of death 
was a single blunt force head injury consistent with a heavy fall to the
back of the head.

Mr Owen, 
who never married, was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at 
Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales up until his death.
