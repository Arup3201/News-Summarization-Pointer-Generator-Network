The daughter of a reality TV star allegedly rammed several parked cars while four times over the limit and then punched one of the arresting officers.

TMZ reported that Lindsey Knickerbocker, daughter of Real Housewives of Orange County star Tammy Knickerbocker, was arrested for DUI on December 14 after police reported she had smashed into two parked cars on Balboa Island in Orange County, California.

Witnesses said the 23-year-old then fled to a friend's house nearby.

Officers say Lindsey then punched one of the arresting officers in the stomach as they followed Lindsey to the house and she was placed under arrest.

Court documents show that Miss Knickerbocker is accused of having a blood alcohol content of .32% at the time of her arrest, four times the legal limit in California.

Lindsey has since been charged with four crimes; DUI, driving with a blood alcohol content of .08 or higher, hit-and-run, and battery on an officer.

She's due in court next month.

According to a fansite dedicated to the show, Lindsey helps her mother with her business Veriya.com, a marketing company which negotiates product placement in feature films, television and reality TV shows.

The Real Housewives of Orange County is a reality television program shown on the Bravo network in America and ITV2 in the UK. It is set in Orange County, California, and chronicles the wealthy lives of a group of housewives as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly.

However, many of the women were victims of the real estate crash in Orange County and the series has since seen the housewives' extravagant lifestyles falter as a result of job losses, evictions, mortgage defaults, foreclosures, and marital strife.

There have been seven seasons so far and there is an eighth in the pipeline.

Tammy Knickerbocker was a main cast member in the second and third season and has since appeared as a guest.

She has another daughter from her first marriage, Megan, as well as a young son named Ryley from another relationship. Her first husband Lou died of a heart attack in 2007.
