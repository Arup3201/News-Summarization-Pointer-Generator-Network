Passing the torch: David Dimbleby has been adamant that he will not be giving up his position as leader of the election coverage, but despite this, the next general election coverage will be his last

David Dimbleby has won the right to present the BBC's general election covering next year, beating out Huw Edwards for the spot.

However, this will be Dimbleby's last time heading the coverage, as he is to step down from fronting after his ninth and final time.

Rival Huw Edwards was apparently given a 'cast-iron guarantee' by former director general Mark Thompson that he would succeed the 75-year-old in the anchor role, but Dimbleby lobbied the new director Lord hall to overturn the decision.

For next year’s election night 
broadcast, Dimbleby will be on air from 10pm as the polls close, through
 until the next morning.

Edwards, 52, will then take over from 7am through to
 the 10pm news bulletin, monitoring results and providing commentary on the progress of the forming of a
 new government.

In an interview in 2010, Dimbleby made it clear he had no intention of stepping down for a successor

He said: 'I don’t have any instinct to make way gracefully.

I shall be dragged kicking and screaming from my chair.'

Dimbleby presented his first election results programme in 1979, on the year Margaret Thatcher rose was elected as prime minister.

Although the 7am handover will mark the end of his general election tenure, Dimbleby will not actually be finished for the day. 

He will return that evening to present a special edition of Question Time.

James Harding, the BBC’s director of news, said: 'This election is likely to be one of the most complex and closely fought in recent times and we are delighted to have such an experienced team to lead our coverage.'

Huw Edwards has been gradually taking over Dimbleby's role as the head of 'event' coverage, seen here anchoring the coverage of the Royal Wedding in 2011

Dimbleby was the BBC’s trusted voice of state occasions for many years but has gradually been succeeded by Edwards.

In addition, Dimbleby was the guide for key moments such as the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother, but Edwards took over for 2011’s royal wedding.

In addition to the election coverage Question Time host will chair an expected debate between the party leaders ahead of the polls.
