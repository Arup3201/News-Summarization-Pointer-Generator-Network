For cartoon fans, it's the purrfect way to fly.

Taiwanese airline, EVA Air, is celebrating iconic fictional character Hello Kitty's 40th birthday by bringing its themed aircraft to Europe.

As of October 29, the carrier will start flying its special edition Boeing 777-300ER between the capital cities of Paris and Taipei, in a move that will mark the aircraft's debut in Europe.

The colourful jet is adorned with images of Hello Kitty and her friends, and features an array of cute cabin features, such as decorated head rest covers and cute pillows for cat naps.

Passengers will be welcomed by cabin crew in Hello Kitty uniforms and receive luggage tags featuring the Japanese cartoon character.

An EVA Air spokesperson added that customers can also look forward to new menus, napkins and Hello Kitty-themed cutlery.

The new Paris services will replace the Taipei to Los Angeles Hello Kitty route, which has been flying three flights a week since 2013.

The airline currently flies to the French capital four times a week, and from October the Hello Kitty aircraft will replace three of those flights.

It will depart from Taipei's Taoyuan International Airport every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday and will return from the French capital's Charles de Gaulle Airport every Monday, Thursday and Saturday.

According to EVA, the Hello Kitty aircraft has been designed in partnership with the cartoon character's creators, Sanrio, to 'make flying fun and spread happiness among passengers all over the globe.'

EVA Airways was formed in 1989 as Taiwan's first privately owned international airline. It launched passenger services in 1991 and cargo services in 1995.  

International cult icon Hello Kitty was created in 1974 by Japanese company Sanrio. Her instantly recognisable face has appeared on a massive array of merchandise from stationary, furniture and toys to sewing machines, toilet paper and even teeth grills.

She recently caused controversy when Sanrio announced that rather than being a cat, she is actually a 'cheerful and happy little girl ... who lives in London with her mama (Mary White), papa (George White), and her twin sister Mimmy.' 

As fans will already know, her birthday is November 1 and her favorite saying is 'You can never have too many friends.'
