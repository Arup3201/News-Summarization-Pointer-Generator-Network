A mother attempted to scare her son straight with an embarrassing Facebook post, after he was arrested in connection to a series of car thefts in Victorville, California.

Paula Hamblen's 17-year-old son has since been released, and cleared of charges, but she says she doesn't regret the post she wrote admonishing his actions and apologizing to the break-in victims.

Hamblen wrote on a Victor Valley news page that she was sorry to any victims whose cars were broken into, saying her son and a friend were hanging out with a bad group of people, including an 'older man who served 15 years in prison'.

Apology: Paula Hamblen wrote this Facebook post after her 17-year-old son was arrested in connection to a series of car break-ins in Victorville California

'I have always been a parent who taught my kids right from wrong and I am very much in shock at the same time.

'I am sorry for my son's stupid choice that he made,' Hamblen wrote.

The post quickly received more than 100 mostly-positive comments, many telling Hamblen that her son's actions were not her fault. 

One of the victims, Steven Edinborough, told KCAL he was 'blown away for her courage to come out' and take the blame.

Hamblen told MailOnline that she picked her son up from jail on Tuesday, after police found no evidence of his fingerprints on the stolen items.

In the clear: Hamblen's son has since been released, and allegedly cleared of the charges, but she says she doesn't regret writing the Facebook post. Pictured above with her son in a photo posted to her Facebook

She says he was driving with a friend, when the car got a flat tire and the friend's dad went to find a spare. When they went looking for the father later, the whole group was arrested for the string of car thefts. Hamblen believes her son wasn't aware of any of the break-ins.

But she doesn't regret posting the Facebook apology.

'I still think it was the right think to do, according to me. Victims were involved in it and I wouldn't want something like that to happen to me,' she told MailOnline.

When she told her son about the Facebook post, and all of the attention it received, he told her he wasn't embarrassed.

'I know you did it because you love me and you're a caring person,' Hamblen recalls her son saying.

She is now issuing a different kind of warning to her son, to be careful who he hangs out with.
