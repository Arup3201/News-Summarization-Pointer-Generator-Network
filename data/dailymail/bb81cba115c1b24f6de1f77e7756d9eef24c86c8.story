A train conductor who unknowingly gave commuters wrong travel information has expressed his regret by printing 500 apology letters and putting one on every seat.

Last Friday, Michael Shaw had told hundreds of commuters waiting on train platforms not to get on his New York City-bound Metro-North train because there was another, faster train behind.

But hours after he passed on this information, he was 'shocked and furious' to learn that the express train had been canceled and that the following train had taken another 30 minutes to reach them.

Apologetic: Michael Shaw wrote apology letters to 500 commuters after he told them to wait for a train traveling between New Haven and New York that he did not know had been cancelled

'I made a huge mistake in telling 
you, MY/OUR passengers to "trust me and wait for the express train 
behind us," not knowing Metro-North had canceled it,' Shaw wrote.

'I will never make this mistake again,' he continued. 'I know it's too late to fix... but I wanted you to know how embarrassed and truly sorry myself and my crew are.'

Speaking to the New York Times, the 48-year-old dad explained that after learning that he had provided the wrong information to customers 'who I see every day', he could not shake his guilt.

'I knew Monday morning they were going 
to ask me a million questions,' he said. 'I thought, "How can I 
apologize?"'

Considerate: He put his apology letters on seats for commuters to read on Monday

He
 knew that Metro North put letters on seats when they have an incident 
affecting a lot of people. So over the weekend, he went home and worked 
on the apology letter before printing 500 copies.

And
 the commuters were grateful. Many contacted Shaw, who had included his 
Twitter handle - @Shawdogs65 - on the letter, to pass on their 
appreciation.

Commuter Katie Coleman, 33, told the Times: 'It was absolutely amazing. It made my day, actually.'

Another
 recipient, Ashleigh Smith, wrote on Twitter: 'Some people on 
#MetroNorth still care. @Shawdogs65 left commuters an AWESOME letter 
this AM #thelittlethings.'

Metro North said that while a single customer had not complained, it was not the way they did things.

Popular: Shaw, pictured with his wife Tina, said he had been inundated with positive responses after the letter

'Conductor Mike Shaw is one of the many Metro-North Railroad employees who care deeply about our customers,' a statement from the company read.

'His open letter expresses the same frustration that customers and employees alike feel about the railroadâ€™s recent challenges. While we share his concerns, we do not condone his methods of communicating them.'

Shaw, who has worked at Metro-North for more than 30 years, will be re-instructed in railroad policy, the spokesman said.
