Checking out: Joy Bricker spent over 10 years at the TownePlace Suites Marriott in Falls Church

A 79-year-old woman has finally checked out of her hotel suite, after staying in the same room for over a decade.

Joy Bricker first stayed in Room 202 at Towne Place Suites by Marriott, in Falls Church, Virginia, on August 4, 2001 and only moved out last week.

The former pilot from Pennsylvania lost her husband, Glenn, to cancer 10 years ago and soon afterwards was offered a job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and jumped at the opportunity.

Mrs Bricker, who spent most of her married life in Ashland, New Hampshire, negotiated a deal which meant that she was paying $139 (£87) a night for the 500 sq ft, two-bedroom suite.

Her
reasoning was simple: that figure was not too much more than most of the flats 
available for rent in the Washington metro area $1,700 (roughly £1,060 a
month).

The extra cost was justified because in addition to 
freshly washed sheets, a daily cleaned room and continental breakfast, 
she was also provided with around-the-clock security and free WiFi and 
cable television access.

And, after checking out last Wednesday, she succeeded in becoming the longest extended-stay guest in the hotel chain's history.

The 79-year-old has outstayed six managers at the hotel

OCTOBER 2011: Colonel Gaddafi is killed in Sitre, LibyaIt's little surprise that she has become a Platinum Premier member of the Marriott Rewards frequent guest loyalty program.

Mrs Bricker began her professional career late in life - when she was 50.

Years of political organising helped her strike up a friendship with Elizabeth and Bob Dole which led to her first job during Ronald Regan's administration at the Department of Transportation in 1981.

An appointment at the White House followed, where she began work for the campaign 'A Drug Free America' in 1986.

After moving in to Room 202 Mrs Bricker quickly became a part of the hotel community, and has outstayed six managers, and has developed firm opinions about how the hotel should be run.

But the only piece of furniture she introduced to the room was an old armchair.

In addition, there were only some plants, computer equipment, books and photo albums to move out of the room.

She made friends with staff and neighbours, and recently her Kuwaiti friend who lived next door to Room 202 brought round traditional meals of spiced stew for them to share.

'It's helped my appetite,' she told CNN. 'I call it community planning. I turned it into a community.

'I would give a million dollars to manage a property like this for one year.

'No matter where we look, there’s always ways to save a few more pennies.'

Her daughter, Christy Winton, added of her mother: 'She turned them into family, and they accepted.'

Now suffering from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Mrs Bricker will move in with her daughter in New York and she intends to use her energies in the church.

She said: 'If I've set a goal, I'm going to reach it.'

And she said that her goal now is to 'continue offering whatever I am able to give' and added: 'I have to help. I'm not a sitter.'

But Mrs Winton warned her mother with a smile: 'There’s no continental breakfast at the Winton Inn.'
