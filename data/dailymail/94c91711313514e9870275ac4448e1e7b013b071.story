Ryan Giggs was presented with a lifetime achievement award at Thursday night's ceremony at Old Trafford, but that hasn't necessarily signified the end of his football career.

Manchester United's interim player-coach will wait until after the club's final game against Southampton on Sunday to decide whether he will continue as a player, join the new manager's backroom staff or manage at another club.

Dutchman Louis van Gaal is widely expected to be announced as David Moyes' successor in the next week - and his arrival could determine the Welshman's future.

'I have not decided,' the 40-year-old said.

'I am too busy trying to prepare a team for Southampton and that is my priority at the moment.

'When the season ends I will go away and think about what I want to do next.

'I said five or six years ago that if my career ended tomorrow I would be happy so every year is a bonus.

'I still enjoy training and playing but I have really enjoyed the last couple of weeks so it has been a good experience to take me on to the next chapter of my life.'

The only certainty for the Premier League's most decorated player is thatÂ  United will perform much better next season.

'It's been a disappointing season but if you are a proper club, which we are, you always bounce back,' said Giggs, who made his debut for United in 1991.

'In football you have setbacks. In my first full season we lost out to Leeds in the league and I was sat in the dressing room as an 18 year-old watching grown men cry.

'We came back the next year and won the league for the first time in 26 years and there is not a doubt in my mind that we will be back next year, we will be challenging and that is what proper clubs do - they have setbacks and come back stronger.'
