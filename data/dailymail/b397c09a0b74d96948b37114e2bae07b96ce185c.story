Meet Britain's biggest burlesque dancer - who has become Britain's top erotic stage performer despite being a 14 stone size 16.

Charlene Taylor, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, once shied away from the limelight and thought sexy dancing was only for 'skinny girls'.

But after joining a dance class for fun, the 26-year-old discovered a natural flair for saucy moves - and is now a paid burlesque dancer.

Charlene - stage name Chazabelle Royale - is
 the current Miss Burlesque South Yorkshire and Doncaster and is flying the flag for larger women 
as she cavorts on stage in a G-string and a feather boa.

The mother-of-one said: 'At first I felt nervous about donning racy lingerie to dance in 
front of strangers, but as my confidence grew I couldn't wait to get up 
on stage.

'After
 every performance people would come up to me and tell me how refreshing
 it was to see a big girl dancing and how talented I was.

Charlene says that doing burlesque makes her feel like Dita Von Teese

At 14 stone and a size 16, Charlene, who is Miss Burlesque UK, says she is flying the flag for bigger woman

'For most of my adult life I believed being sexy meant being a size 10, but now I know that's not the case and I want other women to know they can do whatever they want - despite their size or shape.'

Charlene took the plunge into burlesque after spotting an advert for dance classes in her local newspaper in March 2013.

Her confidence was at rock bottom after a bad relationship and she was persuaded to have a go by family and friends.

Charlene's confidence was at an all time low before she started dancing, but now she loves her body

Charlene is hoping to retain Miss Burlesque UK title this year as she continues to work as a dancer

She
 said: 'I was a bag of nerves when I walked into the first class, but 
the other girls made me feel at ease even though they had much better 
figures than me.'

But
 as the weeks rolled by, her confidence rocketed and soon she was 
shimmying around in next to nothing and feeling like 'Dita Von Teese'.

Charlene, a single mother to son Callum, two, says her size 16 body and 14 stone weight has helped her 'stand out'.

Charlene now loves parading in front of an audience in her lingerie

'Although people think that dancers have to look a certain way, I soon forgot that I was a big girl on stage,' she said.

'When members of the audience started commenting about how great I looked, it continued to boost my confidence.'

In October 2013 she beat 50 other dancers to the title of Miss Burlesque 2013 and is hoping to retain her crown later this year.

'People tell me I'm an inspiration,' said Charlene, who performs in pubs and clubs in Yorkshire. 'I'm flying the flag for bigger women who feel ashamed of their bodies.

'I used to hate my body but now I love it. You don't have to be skinny to be sexy, and I'm the living proof.'
