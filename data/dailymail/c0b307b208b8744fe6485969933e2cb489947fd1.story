Not many girls from New Jersey can lay claim to shaking hands with a chimp named Ricky at the age of three, or being scooped up by an elephant at seven.

But Amelia Forman is no city kid. She's actually more of a jungle girl.

Now 15, her mother, award-winning photographer, Robin Schwartz, who’s worked for the likes of National Geographic and has prints in the MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has 12 years worth of photos of her daughter cozying up to exotic creatures.

The project officially took flight in 2004, spawned by a sudden family tragedy.

Animal nature: Amelia Forman, pictured here at Grandpa's beach in Easthampton last year, has been posing for her photographer mom, Robin Schwartz, for 12 years

Gothic: Now 15, Amelia has started putting her own print on the photos, such as styling the costumes

'My mother and mother-in-law died quite close to each other and it knocked me for six,' said Schwartz.

'After that though, I realised that it was so important to spend time with my daughter.

'So we came to the understanding that if she was to come with me on my photographic work our deal would be that the only times I would take pictures of her would be when she was with animals.

'She loves them, she is so natural with them.

'She is a shy girl, but can have more confidence with a giraffe, or a chimpanzee than a fully grown man or woman could have with another person.

The unusual photographs have been compiled into a book called Amelia and the Animals

Amelia has bottle-fed tiger cubs, nuzzled deer in the woods while wearing a black wizard's cloak, and straddled an elephant¿s trunk as if riding a rope swing

As she grows older, Amelia has started taking a keen interest in fashion

'We spend time most summers attending fairs and meeting contacts in the animal community, where Amelia can come close to elephants like Shiba, who simply picked her up with her trunk.

'That was a magical moment for me and Amelia. It really was like Amelia was talking to Shiba, just like you would with a person. It was beautiful.'

While their adventures has already produced one book, Amelia's World, The Aperture Foundation is trying to raise funds on Kickstarter for another that encompasses the whole journey, to be called Amelia and the Animals.

'Since I was only three, it seemed sort of normal just to know monkeys and a lot of different animals,' Amelia says in the Kickstarter video, 'until I got older and I realized that wasn’t something that most kids had the opportunity to do.'

'I love animals and work with them quite extensively,' said Robin Schwartz, who lives in New Jersey.

'I had produced a series called "Primate Portraits" and through that I had built up a network of contacts in the animal community in New York state and subsequently through other parts of America.

'As part of my work with chimpanzees, lemurs, gibbons and smaller monkeys inside a circus family in 2002 my daughter was sometimes there and she was photographed.

'The first time was when she was three years old and she met a young chimp named Ricky.

'Their rapport was instant and they were great together. They just sat there kissing and became firm friends instantly.'

Robin says she is aware of photographing Amelia around wild - albeit highly trained - animals.

'I don't want to put my daughter in harm's way,' said Robin.

'But things can happen any time with anyone. The animals are partly pets, I talk to the owners.

'It is a risk, just like walking to school.

'This is a way for us to spend time together and brings my daughter and me to the animals we both share a deep love for.

'We both feel lucky to get this close.'

Time for a nap: The youngster has a nap as she gets up close to these kangaroos

'The one thing that upsets me most is when people ask me if being close to large giraffes, kangaroos, elephants or chimpanzees is scary.

'It isn't at all, I am not scared around them, we respect each other.

'If I don't like the feeling I get off one animal then I will not go near to it. We are cautious

'But my favorite experience so far has been with a beautiful gibbon called Maddie in Texas.

'I feel very lucky to have had these experiences with these animals.'
