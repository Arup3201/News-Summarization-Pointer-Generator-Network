Online rant: Senator Ted Cruz has been the subject of Twitter vitriol

The man, identified as Troy Gilmore Jr, posted on Twitter Friday morning: 'Take down Ted Cruz, at his home' and listed Cruzâ€™s home address in Houston, Texas.

'Lets Find Ted Cruz, Texas address and show up his House, drag him out and B***h slap his A** in front of the country,' another tweet reads.

'Ted Cruz, we want you a** go the f*** back in Canada, else you and ur family will pay. U got a f***ing big mouth,' the same person wrote.

He denied threatening Ted Cruz and urged his 49 followers to get Republicans out of Washington 'on a rail.'

Troy Gilmore Jr has also been active on Facebook where he has published Cruz's address and numerous rants against the Republican party stemming from the government shutdown.

'Weâ€™re aware of it and have alerted the proper authorities. I canâ€™t comment further on security matters,' Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton told The Hill.

According to The Hill, the threats weren't so much a call to action, since @ArmyVet54 did not have any Twitter followers.

However, @KingKing now has 49.The man behind the handle identifies as an Army veteran, father of three and native of New Jersey who now lives in Florida.

Capitol Police spokesman Shennell Antrobus told The Hill the department is 'looking into that matter' and that they take all threats against members of Congress seriously.
