Fight: Alex Miller, 25, is the blonde at the centre of a love triangle that saw a City firm's Christmas party descend into a violent brawl

This is the blonde at the centre of a love triangle that saw a City firm’s Christmas party descend into a violent brawl.

Alex Miller, 25, inadvertently triggered the mayhem when her stockbroker fiancé Robert Nicolson, 27, was told she had cheated on him with one of his colleagues.

Dozens of bankers looked on in horror as Nicolson angrily confronted unsuspecting IT worker Anthony Field, igniting an ugly scuffle that tore through the packed Queen Of Hoxton cocktail bar in Shoreditch, east London.

Mr Field was left with two black eyes and facial injuries while Nicolson and at least two friends were arrested by police.

Yesterday, Nicolson admitted affray but was cleared of assault after a three-day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

Friends said an explosion of publicity around the case had sent party-loving London worker Miss Miller ‘into hiding’.

One said she moved out of the £200,000 home the couple shared in Grays, Essex, a few months after the punch-up.

He added: ‘We have not seen her for months. She still goes out but it is with a different crowd. No one wants to mention what happened.’

The brawl took place when staff from City financial house Brewin Dolphin gathered for a Christmas party last December.

Nicolson noticed his then fiancée was crying and was told by a friend that she had slept with a colleague.

Mr Field was pointed out and Nicolson stormed over and grabbed him, starting a sprawling fight involving up to six other men, including Nicolson’s colleague Gary Jones, 33, who admitted smashing a glass bottle over the IT worker’s head.

Another co-worker, Graham Sutherland, a 27-year-old data analyst of Holloway, north London, was cleared of throwing one or two punches.

Nicolson said that he initially confronted Mr Field, who he claimed responded by headbutting and punching him.

Giving evidence, Mr Field insisted that he had not known Miss Miller was Nicolson’s fiancée before the fight.

Judge Joanna Korner QC told Nicolson he will probably receive a community penalty when he returns to be sentenced next Thursday.

Directing the jury to clear him of the more serious charge of assault, she said: ‘The harm itself seems to have been caused by the other people who laid in.

'He certainly never got anywhere near Mr Field.

'On that evidence, it seems to me as a matter of law his behaviour is not very good but that’s not the same as there being evidence he committed either of the two counts charged.’

Miss Miller’s mother Clare Gibbs, of Rye, East Sussex, said her daughter, who now lives in Ashford, Kent, did not want to talk about the incident.

Nicolson declined to comment last night when approached at his mother’s home in Grays.

Jones, of the Isle of Dogs, East London, will also be sentenced next Thursday.
