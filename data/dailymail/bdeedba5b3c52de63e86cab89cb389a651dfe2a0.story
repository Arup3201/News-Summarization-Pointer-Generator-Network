Fear: Robert Chote, who heads the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that Britain is on the verge of a dangerous housing bubble

Britain is on the verge of a dangerous housing bubble, the Treasury’s chief watchdog warned yesterday.

Soaring property prices are being inflated by speculators banking on further gains, according to Robert Chote, who heads the Office for Budget Responsibility.

‘With very rapid house price increases in some parts of the country you might see bubbly activity where people are willing to buy stuff off plan or not intend to live in it,’ Mr Chote told MPs.

Prince Charles gave a separate warning yesterday that soaring prices in London will drive a generation of young people out of the capital. He said the dream of home ownership was becoming further and further out of reach for swathes of workers.

The average price of a home in London is expected to jump from £458,000 to £650,000 over the next six years.

‘This isn’t sustainable and risks driving away talented young individuals who are starting their careers in London and spending most of their income on rent,’ said the prince. ‘Home ownership for this generation is seemingly becoming further and further out of reach.’

Official figures show the price of the average UK home hit £254,000 in January – a rise of 6.8 per cent in a year. Prices were up 13.2 per cent in London, 7.1 per cent in the South East and 6.9 per cent in Wales.

First-time buyers paid a record £190,000 to get on the housing ladder in January. Estate agents are now organising open days in some hotspots to meet demand and many homes go to auction-style sealed bids.

‘Open days are necessary with the feeding frenzy out there,’ said Peter Rollings of estate agents Marsh & Parsons.

Ed Mead, of Douglas & Gordon, 
another London agency, said: ‘Any estate agent in London has buyers 
coming out of their ears. What they are all fighting for is sellers.’

Mr
 Chote told the Treasury select committee the surge in prices was partly
 down to soaring demand, driven by rising confidence, increased lending,
 and government schemes such as Help to Buy – all combined with lack of 
supply.

He added: ‘You can 
explain the increase in house prices by fundamentals without having to 
resort to saying there is a bubble going on.

‘That
 doesn’t mean to say there may not be some bubbly components to what is 
going on in the housing market in particular parts of the country.’

A
 report from the Home Builders Federation this week showed that Britain 
is now one million homes short of meeting its housing needs.

The 
independent OBR expects house prices to rise by more than 30 per cent in
 the next five years.

Mr 
Chote insisted it was not ‘taking a view that house prices are over or 
undervalued’ and said house price inflation should cool from 8.5 per 
cent this year to 3.7 per cent in 2017 and 2018.

Steve Nickell, an economist who sits 
on the OBR with Mr Chote, said: ‘A bubble arises when demand is being 
driven by people wanting to get in because of expectations of price 
growth rather than for somewhere to live.

‘The
 house price to income ratio has been growing for the last 40 years but 
that cannot go on forever because everything you consume would become 
housing and there would be nothing else left.’

But
 David Ruffley, a Tory MP on the Treasury committee, said forecasters 
always expect a ‘benign return to equilibrium’ and fail to predict the 
cycle of boom and bust.
