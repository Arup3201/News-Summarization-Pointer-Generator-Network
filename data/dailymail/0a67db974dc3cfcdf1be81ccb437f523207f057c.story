For more than 100 years, a humble brick bridge stood in this quiet Costwolds village.

Now that peace is shattered - after the railway crossing was replaced with a lurid green 'tin can'.

Villagers are furious with Network Rail, which tore down the structure over the Great Western main line and built one four inches higher to leave room for overhead electric wires.

Before: This humble brick bridge stood over the Great Western main line in Wiltshire for more than a century

After: Network Rail had to raise the bridge by four inches - so replaced it with this bolt-ridden lurid 'tin can'

A main road out of Brinkworth, Wiltshire, which has 1,300 residents and claims to be Britain's longest village, was closed for three and a half months while the bridge was installed.

It finally re-opened just before Christmas, but residents were none the wiser about the design because work continued under weatherproof covers.

By the time the green, bolt-ridden metal facade was unveiled, it was too late.

'It's an eyesore. It's a hideous thing,' said villager Jim Humm, 74. 'It's a real monstrosity.

'It is not at all what we expected. The work started in December and they've been doing it for a couple of months now.

'They've had it covered up the whole time they were doing the work so nobody knew it was coming.

'They just took down the covers and there it was, we couldn't even do anything about it because it was already done.

Horror: Residents said they were unaware of the 'monstrosity' taking shape because it was built under covers

One resident said: 'The look just doesn't fit, it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area'

'It was such a shock when it was revealed, it's like a giant tin can. It really ruins the look of our nice little village.'

Another local, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'Basically it's an absolute eyesore and a travesty that it's been built to this kind of design.

'This is a small rural rural village. Ok, you can imagine and understand that things have to change and progress but what they've actually put up is a joke.

'I mean it looks like a rotten tin can. The look just doesn't fit, it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area.'

The old bridge was built over the new Wootton Bassett to Bristol spur of the Great Western main line which opened to trains in 1903, two years after the death of Queen Victoria.

Fuming: Jim Humm, 74, is one of the 1,300 residents in Brinkworth, the longest village in Britain at six miles

Mr Humm said: 'It's an eyesore. It's a hideous thing. It's a real monstrosity. It is not at all what we expected'

It was a feat of engineering in its day, slashing the travel time from London to south Wales, but is now undergoing the most dramatic upgrade in its history.

Diesel trains still run on the line so rail bosses are electrifying the entire route - but the £500million cost is spiralling according to Labour, who claimed in October it had reached £1.6billion.

For efficiency reasons, and because an EU directive says new lines must be able to take European trains, Network Rail is installing overhead electric wires instead of an electrified 'third rail'.

That means several bridges over the ageing line are too low and have to be replaced.

A Network Rail spokesman said officials do not know how much the bridge cost because contractors were paid for a series of bridges in one deal.

Eyesore: The bridge is part of a multi-million pound scheme to electrify the line between London and Bristol

Brave new world: Network Rail apologised for the look of the bridge but said it had to save taxpayers' money

But she added: 'We are sorry to hear that some residents do not find the bridge at School Hill aesthetically pleasing.

'This bridge required essential work to prepare it for electrification and the arrival of a new fleet of faster, longer, quieter and greener electric trains.

'As a public funded organisation, we must balance our duty to preserve the heritage of the railway with the best use of taxpayers' money.

'Now this bridge is reopen, people and businesses in the area are a step closer to seeing the benefits that electrification and the new electric trains will bring.'
