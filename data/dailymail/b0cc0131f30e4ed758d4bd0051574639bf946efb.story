The prosecution rested their case yesterday by playing a shocking 'sex tape' to jurors, which left some of them in tears before Warren Jeffs opened his defence with a lecture on religion and history.

The explosive end contrasted sharply with the slow pace of Jeffs' opening statement and four-hour questioning of one of his followers regarding Mormon history and scripture.

As the 'sex tape' was played, jurors were seen covering their mouths in horror while some were seen wiping their eyes.

The alleged 12-year-old victim was 
mentioned by name twice on the 21-minute tape, in which Mr Jeffs can be 
heard breathing heavily and panting.

The recording was allegedly made at the 
Yearning for Zion ranch in Texas, owned by the FLDS. It begins with 
Jeffs asking the girl how she feels.

According to the transcript made and given to the court, the girl replies: 'Feels good.'

Soon after Jeffs can be heard saying: 'Everyone else let go of me, back away a little. Please get on the other side of the bed.

'You shall learn the powers of the 
spirit of God as a heavenly wife should,' Jeffs tells the 12-year-old.

'Let the heavenly comfort hear us.

'We bless you, by the Lord, at this young age. To come to know God and his power, and feel his presence.'

According to CNN, many jurors lowered their heads and closed their eyes during the recording.

The voice is also heard saying: 'You have to know how to be sexually excited and to help each other ... and you have to be ready for the time I need your comfort.

'This is your mission. This is how you abide the law.'

At one point, he says: 'Take your clothes off. Do it right now.'

The sounds of crying followed as he then says: 'Just don't think about the pain, you're going to heaven. The world's view of sexual relations is selfish, the celestial view is not.'

In another part of the recording he can be heard saying: 'Do you feel ... your servant ... fill them with the Holy Ghost ... deliver these ladies.'

The male voice can also be heard saying: 'You will be able to come into the heavenly session ... and see heavenly visions, the angels, this shall make to come to know God in his power and feel his presence.'

Documents show earlier said that a child of the alleged 15-year-old victim was conceived in a 'heavenly session'.

As the session ends, Jeffs begins to 
pray, saying: 'Behold father these three ladies, innocent and pure. We 
thank you for these gifts and join in a prayer of oneness.'

He then asks the 12-year-old for a hug.

Just before the tape ends, Mr Jeffs is heard saying, 'in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.'

Three female voices then reply: 'Amen.'

The tape was taken by police from the car Mr Jeffs was riding in when he was arrested in 2006.

After his 30-minute opening statement, Jeffs called his first witness,
 JD Roundy, a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints, who read passages from Mormon scripture under Jeffs' 
questioning.

During the four-hour questioning - 
which was focused solely on scripture and mentioned nothing of the 
sexual assault charges - jurors are said to have appeared impatient.

Prosecutor Eric Nichols objected 
several times, saying that neither man’s religious beliefs were relevant
 to the sexual assault charges.

Judge Barbara Walther let Jeffs 
continue, but admonished him to stay on topic, saying: 'I don’t believe 
the pursuit of your defence should be trying to lecture or teach the 
jury about your religion.'

The topics included the 'everlasting covenant' of plural marriage, and the idea of a living prophet who is the voice of God.

Jeffs, the head of the 
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is accused 
of sexually assaulting two girls, ages 12 and 15, that he took as brides in 
'spiritual marriages.'

During his 30-minute long opening statement, Jeffs compared the plight of the FLDS church to that of the American Civil Rights Movement.

'There has been a persecuting zeal 
against a religion seeking religious freedom,' he said. Jeffs said he 
wants there to be understanding of his religion before judgement comes, according to the Salt lake Tribune.

On Tuesday, another jaw-dropping 
audio tape revealed the 55-year-old church leader instructing his sister
 wives that they must 'work together' to please him sexually.

Mr Jeffs, who is representing himself after firing his high-powered legal team, vehemently objected before both of the tapes were played, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Judge Barbara Walther overruled him each time.

Tuesday's 90-minute segment details how the young brides should become 'so natural as clothed as unclothed' and always shower before getting near him.

Mr Jeffs is also heard instructing the woman on how to maintain their pubic hair, and a woman is heard showing the other wives how to properly shave their armpits.

He says on the tape: 'No one sits around, everyone assists each other.'

This came after a doctor and forensic analyst testified Mr Jeffs was the father of a 15-year-old's child.

An excerpt from hundreds of pages of his personal journals said the child was 'pure and innocent and 
willing to obey' and he summoned her parents and 'informed them of their
 girl belonging to me.'

Prosecutors played the tape of Warren Jeffs 
talking to the girl when she was 14 after Texas Ranger Nick 
Hannah testified about documents and electronic files seized during a 
2008 police raid at the church's remote compound in West Texas.

Among the documents seized was a record of Jeffs' spiritual marriage 'for time and all eternity' with the 14-year-old in January 2004.

The FLDS church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. 

Followers see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on earth.

Hannah read from Mr Jeffs' journals, which said he took the 14-year-old the night after their wedding with him and another of his new wives on a car ride outside the church's headquarters along the Utah-Arizona border for 'training.'

In writing about the session in his 
journal later, Jeffs said he told his wives they were 'honorable 
vessels, property of your husband's kingdom and the Kingdom of God on 
Earth.'

Excerpts of Mr Jeffs' 
journal described the Lord ordering him to visit Eldorado, 
Texas, about 45 miles south of San Angelo, and the church purchasing 
1,700 acres of land outside the town for $1.2 million in 2003. He called
 the area 'Place of Refuge 17,' or R-17.

'This will only be a place of 
refuge if it is kept sacred and secret,' Mr Jeffs wrote, adding that his 
followers should populate the area and let 'a community grow here more 
in hiding before the neighbors find out.'

He told followers to plant cotton 
and raise animals and said they could build whatever they wanted thanks 
to Texas' lax zoning laws. Construction teams working around-the-clock 
erected dozens of buildings, including a sprawling, white-limestone 
temple.

Texas authorities raided the 
compound in April 2008 after receiving a call to an abuse hotline that 
turned out to be a hoax.

More than 400 FLDS children who were placed in 
protective custody were eventually returned to their families.

But police saw underage girls who 
were clearly pregnant and found Jeffs' journals and the other documents 
in a vault at the end of a secret passageway in the temple.

Another 
vault in an annex building provided still more records and files.

Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men were 
charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy. So far, all 
seven who have been prosecuted have been convicted — receiving prison 
sentences of between six and 75 years.

Mugshot: Jeffs after being arrested following the 2009 raid on his church

Gasps were heard among jurors earlier this week when pictures were revealed showing him kissing and 
cuddling a 12-year-old girl.

The photographs show Jeffs with a young
 redhead, who he is alleged to have raped, grinning and kissing the 
girl.

The images were said to have been taken July 27, 2006 – days after the girl’s 12th 
birthday.

Authorities
 raided the Yearning For Zion compound, 45 miles south of San Angelo, 
after receiving an anonymous call to an abuse shelter, alleging that 
girls at the compound were being forced into polygamist marriages.

The
 call turned out to be a hoax, and more than 400 children who had been 
placed in state custody were returned to their families.

But police seized marriage records and thousands of pages of documents and eventually charged Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men.

All
 seven sect members who have been prosecuted so far were convicted of 
crimes including sexual assault and bigamy and received prison sentences
 of between six and 75 years.

Jeffs has repeatedly called the raid 
an illegal search and wants a separate hearing on whether authorities 
violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion.
