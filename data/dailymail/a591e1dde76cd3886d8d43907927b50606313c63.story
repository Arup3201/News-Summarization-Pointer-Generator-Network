A Californian congressman has announced that he is a 'proud grandpa' to a transgender grandchild.

Eight-term San Jose Democrat Mike Honda, 73, made the announcement via a tweet on Wednesday, along with a photo of himself with his arm around eight-year-old Malisa.

'As the proud grandpa of a transgender grandchild, I hope she can feel safe at school without fear of being bullied,' he tweeted.

Pride: Mike Honda has announced that he has nothing but admiration for his granddaughter and hopes she and others like her can be free of the fear of being bullied

Malisa is the middle of three children born to Honda's daughter Michelle who is a public health educator in San Jose.

Honda has decided to speak publicly about his family after Malisa told her grandfather that she would like to be a role model for others in her position and gave her permission for him to go public with her story.

Mom Michelle Honda-Phillips told San Jose Mercury News that her child – initially called Brody – had wanted to be referred to as a girl since she had learned to speak.

'She has never hidden who she was,' said Honda-Phillips, 39, on Thursday. 'The only thing that's changed is her pronoun and her name. She's been exactly the same.'

The family has revealed that Malisa made her transition last July, when she adopted her new name and started to wear girls clothes in public. 

In the fall she was enrolled by her parents at a new school  and - with the support of administrators - she was registered as a girl.

'She's very proud of being transgender. She's embraced the fact she's transgender and she's different and everyone should be comfortable in their skin,' said Honda-Phillips.

The family say they expect people to voice criticism and concern over allowing someone so young to determine such a big change. 

People will say 'it's just a phase or they'll grow out of it,' said Honda. 'But we have to be a little bit more in tune with what youngsters are telling us. From there we can develop better solutions, be more thoughtful.'

Michelle said they had waited until they were confident that Malisa was 'insistent, persistent and consistent' about her gender - three thresholds recommended by the transgender community.

The family is currently looking into hormone therapies that would delay Malisa's puberty.

Honda also mentioned his transgender grandchild in a video played at a conference for school superintendents in Southern California also Wednesday.

'We need to ensure that our LGBTQ youth are never bullied because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These children need our protection and our love,' he posted on Facebook.

Honda, the House Democratic Senior Whip and a longtime supporter of the LGBT community, co-founded the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus with openly gay lawmakers Sen. Tammy Baldwin and former Rep. Barney Frank. 

He also founded and heads the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus, which launched in 2012.

'I came to Congress to fight for the civil and human rights of Americans of all sexual orientations, genders and ethnic backgrounds. All Americans deserve the right to work, live, and love in peace and free from intimidation and prejudice,' he said at the time.
