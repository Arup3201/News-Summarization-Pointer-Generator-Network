U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is backing calls for reduced sentences for certain drug offences in order to unclog the federal prison system, which has been overpopulated for years.

Holder hopes the new plan will reduce the vast prison population by 6,500 inmates over the next five years.

Later today, he is due to deliver a statement before the U.S. Sentencing Commission that sentences will still be very tough for violent criminals while he attempts to finds ways to cut costs in the prison system.

U.S Attorney General Eric Holder has been campaigning for the sentence reductions for low-level drug offences as a part of Obama's 'Smart on Crime' initiative, which hopes to cut costs in the prison system

Under the proposed plan, the average sentence for drug trafficking could drop from the regularly proposed 62 months to as low as 51 months.

This means the plan could eventually lead to cut prison sentences for drug convicts by an average of nearly a year, according to the Justice Department.

The change would affect around 70 per cent of those sentenced for federal drug trafficking offences.

Holder's move is part of Obama's 'Smart on Crime' initiative platform which he has touted since 2013.

In
 a joint effort between conservative lawmakers and governors, the 
Attorney General has been vocal in backing reduced reliance on 
prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders.

Drug trafficking offences are the most common reasons for incarceration at a federal prison, and Holder hopes that by changing sentencing legislation regarding drug trafficking sentences he might reduce the prison sentence by 6,500 in five years

In extracts of his statement, due to be delivered later today, he says: 'This overreliance on incarceration is not just financially unsustainable
 -- it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate.'

However, it is likely these reforms 
will be enacted on a case by case basis, with only certain non-violent 
offenders getting consideration for leniency.

Those
 with charges involving small or moderate amounts of drugs may face a 
reduction in their sentences, but those involved with large amounts of 
drugs will not benefit.

The federal prison system has been drastically over-clogged for a good period of time, with the U.S. housing 25 per cent of all the world's criminals

The Sentencing Commission won't vote 
on the move until April, but in the meantime Holder will be instructing 
federal prosecutors not to oppose defense motions seeking lower 
sentences for drug charges - as per his proposal.

For now, most federal judges sentence within the guidelines range, with 2005 legislation from the Supreme Court ruling that judges must consider recommended sentences, but do not have to necessarily follow it.Â 

The 'Smart on Crime' imitative seeks to reduce the federal prison population, along with the costs that come with it, while still preserving public safety.

The initiative focuses on crime diversion programs, as well as more advanced drug and veteran courts, as well as attempting to draft new criminal charges for low-level drug offenders that do not trigger mandatory federal prison sentences - which clog up the prison system.

Holder said in a statement last year: 'Too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long and for no truly good law enforcement reason.'

If the vote is successful and the new sentencing guidelines are approved, prisoners who have already been sentenced that would be eligible for a smaller sentence will be able to apply for re-sentencing.

Holder's plan has come after months of debating about the overcrowding in the U.S. federal prison system, which many agreed needed to be drastically dealt with, but with nobody really sure which tactic to pursue.

Previous proposals included a review of sentence disparities, such as those between white males and black males (black male offenders often received 20 per cent longer sentences that white male offenders committing the same crimes), improving counseling and rehabilitation programs to reduce re-offenders, and compassionate early release of elderly members of federal prisons.

The proposal to change mandatory jail time for drug charges was endorsed by Arizona criminal defense attorney, who said in August 2013: 'We need to get rid of the mandatory 
sentencing system, even if the policy changes Federal law; states handle
 the vast majority of drug cases.'
