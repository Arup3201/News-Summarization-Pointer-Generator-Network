England football supremo Greg Dyke may have feared the worst when he made his now notorious cut-throat gesture after the World Cup draw.

But the nation’s fans were celebrating last night when it was announced that the team’s first game had been rescheduled – meaning they won’t have to stay up all night to watch England’s  opening fixture of Brazil 2014  on television.

The match against Italy has been moved forward by three hours to 11pm on Saturday, June 14 in Britain – after football’s global authority FIFA caved in to television demands by broadcasters in Europe.

The earlier kick-off means conditions at the stadium will be even more oppressive

Originally, England fans had faced the
daunting prospect of having to watch the match starting at 2am on the 
Sunday.

However, the earlier kick-off of 6pm local time will not be 
welcomed by the England team – led by captain Steven Gerrard. 

It means the conditions will be even more oppressive in the hot and humid Amazonian jungle city of Manaus.

Humidity is predicted to reach 80 per cent and temperatures to rise as high as 86F.

Meanwhile, FA chairman Dyke has told friends he regrets making his throat-slitting gesture.

It
was seen by millions of television viewers around the world and was 
interpreted as a lack of faith in England’s ability  to beat Uruguay and
Italy and progress from the group stage.

Friends of FA chairman Greg Dyke said he regrets making a throat-slitting gesture after the draw was made

One friend of Dyke, who asked 
not to be named, said: ‘Greg is adamant that it wasn’t a serious gesture
– that it was simply a bit of fun. But he regrets it because it has 
been taken out of context.

‘The
fact is Greg’s reaction would have been shared by many people watching 
at home. People are always saying they want the people in suits to act 
like real people but when they do, they go nuts. You just can’t win.’

England were drawn in Group D with the Italians, the Uruguayans and Costa Rica.

They
will face the Italians at the Arena Amazonia in Manaus – one of several
venues across Brazil where construction has yet to be completed.

England
manager Roy Hodgson had said before the draw that he had hoped to avoid
the city of Manaus – which is known for its hot and humid climate.
