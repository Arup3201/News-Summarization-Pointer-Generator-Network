Robert De Niro has found that he's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of Gardiner

With past Hollywood roles including mobsters, criminals and villains, Robert De Niro is no stranger to playing the baddie.

But the actor is probably not so happy to be cast in this most recent villainous role - in a real-life small-town tax dispute.

De Niro has found that he's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of Gardiner in upstate New York in a quarrel over a property tax bill.

The conflict centers on De Niro's 78-acre homestead, which was bought by the actor's Riverside Trust in 1997 for $1.5 million. 

Since then a fresh valuation from assessors in Gardiner has put the worth of the property at $6 million, which - if it is allowed to stand - would mean the Riverside Trust owes the town $170,000. 

But the trust has challenged the valuation, leading to an extended legal battle that has left the tiny town with debts totaling more than $100,000. 

It is not clear whether De Niro sanctioned the legal challenge, but it has not made the actor popular among residents in the small farming community of around 5,800 people.

According to the New York Times, when De Niro's trust acquired the property in 1997, it included an 18th-century wood-frame farmhouse and two outbuildings with a total of six bedrooms and seven baths.

The Riverside Trust has since added 20 acres. A barn was turned into a 14,000-square-foot recreation center with a game room, gym, basketball court, swimming pool, steam room, sauna - and boxing ring and small film studio. 

Another barn was turned into a workshop and one was built as an office. There are also two guesthouses on the property, as well as a tennis court and a small ski slope.

The trust's assessor valued the property - which sits about 75 miles north of Manhattan - at $4 million.

Justice Mary Work of State Supreme Court in Ulster County sided with the town at the trial.

'The defining characteristics of the subject property are privacy and self-sufficiency, which would appeal to buyers seeking property in a wide range of areas outside New York City,' she wrote in her decision in June.

The town offered a settlement for slightly less than its $6 million assessment but the Riverside Trust rejected it and filed an appeal. It could save $57,000 a year if the legal challenge succeeds.

'He took his stand, which is his right, we all agree with that,' Carl Zatz, a former film producer now in his fourth term as Gardiner town supervisor, told the New York Times.

'Now it's like, 'I can afford this fight, so I'm going to dig my heels in'. '

The Town Board feels it is worth resisting the trust's challenge at present, but there are fears that the legal debts will continue to mount for the tiny town. 

'What if he wins, or we give up? Then everybody else has to pick up the slack,' added Warren Wiegand, a member of the board. 'But can we afford to keep fighting, either?'

Some Gardiner residents remain sympathetic to De Niro, acknowledging that he has employed dozens of local residents to build and maintain his considerable property, and saying that he is acting the part of any taxpayer.

Roger Rascoe, the chairman of the Ulster County Republican Party, told the New York Times that he felt taxes were too high for everyone. But he added that De Niro may well have lost a lot of supporters when the trust challenged the original decision.

'People can work their whole lives and not make even close to what he spent on this place,' Mr. Rascoe said. 'It's difficult for us to feel for him.'
