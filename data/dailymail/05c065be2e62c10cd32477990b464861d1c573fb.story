It seems even extra-terrestrials retire to Florida.

Residents of a Naples condo building swear that a UFO came to Earth to check out the swimming pool and stayed for 30 minutes Monday night.

Security guard Debralee Thomas says she was monitoring the surveillance camera feeds when she noticed an unusual pair of lights that appeared to be hovering over the water.Â

What is it? The video shows a disc-like object hovering over the pool before expanding and dipping into the waters, pulsing for half an hour

The lights appear to be illuminating a saucer-shaped object in the sky, residents claim

The strange object stuck around for about 30 minutes and then vanished without explanation

'I realized that it was something that wasn't normal, so I was like "Oh my, what is that," she told WBBH-TV.

As a security guard who stares at video screens for hours, Thomas said she's seen some bizarre-looking things on her screens that turn out to be nothing at all.

Bug that fly into the camera lenses, for instance, can offer a frightening spectacle for someone who doesn't know what they're looking at.

But this was no bug. When she taped the encounter and showed the footage to her friends, they agreed that it indeed looked like something extraterrestrial.

'We watched it on tape and to be honest,
 I was so grateful that it was there so I could say it was real...it 
really happened,' Thomas said.

What's the interest? It's unknown why extra-terrestrials might be interested in this condo swimming pool in Naples

Thomas sent the video to the Mutual UFO Network, an Ohio-based UFO organization, for analysis. The leaders of the organization said they don't believe the video is a hoax.

But, they can't say what the strange lights are.

A wildlife biologist that examined the video for WBBH said the images could not have been an animal.

Residents have been going into the condo's offices just to watch the video and see the event for themselves.

'I've
 never seen anything like this,' said resident Curtis Kate. 'The 
electrical charges coming from it, it's truly unbelievable.'

The
 mystery of the UFO remains unsolved for now, and Thomas is OK with that
 just as long as it doesn't happen under her watch again.
