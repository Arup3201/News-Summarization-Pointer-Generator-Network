He’s been gone a year and a half, been given two different names and even changed sex - but now Bob’s back.

A cat missing for more than a year and a half has shown up - 200 miles from his Tyneside home.

Owner Julia Jauncey was devastated when Bob disappeared just before Christmas in 2012.

But the 33-year-old and Bob have now been reunited after he was discovered in Leicester.

A
 vet from the East Midlands got the shock of his life when he checked 
Bob’s microchip, which revealed he had strayed from Gateshead.

Ms Jauncey, an insurance broker, said: 'I was just in total shock, I couldn’t believe it and I had to listen to the message on my answer machine again to check I was hearing them correctly.'

Bob was well known in Crawcrook and even had his own seat in the local hairdresser’s and many families had bought him presents for Christmas before he disappeared.

Villagers threw a welcome home party for Bob last week - even decorating his home with balloons and banners

Ms Jauncey said: 'I was devastated when he went missing and I couldn’t wait to get him back.

'He had been away so long and I was worried he wasn’t going to settle but it’s like he’s never been away.

'On our street we have a dentist and a hairdresser’s and he would always go in and out of the houses and a lot of people were upset.'

Ms Jauncey was told Bob had been taken by a family who had been visiting relatives in Gateshead because they thought he was a stray as he wasn't wearing a collar.

He was then taken almost 200 miles to Leicester and named Galia as the family thought he was a girl.

The ginger tomcat was then passed to a business owner in January 2013, who had called him Cromitte, and it wasn’t until he was taken to the vet that the then owner noticed he was chipped and belonged to Ms Jauncey.
