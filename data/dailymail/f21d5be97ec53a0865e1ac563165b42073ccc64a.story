Richard Simpkin has been mastering the art of selfies with celebrities long before social media and the invention of camera phones.

The Sydney born photographer has an impressive collection of self portraits with the rich and famous - having met the likes of Michael Jackson, Michael Hutchence, Kylie Minogue, Audrey Hepburn and Oprah Winfrey.

But after 25 years on the job, he's calling it quits.

Almost famous: Richard Simpkin has brushed shoulders with celebrities for 25 years including the king of pop Michael Jackson in 1996

'It's been a lot of fun and a great adventure but I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore,' he said.

'Celebrities today are not what they used to be. I think they're more like throw away plastics now.

'The word celebrity has lost its value and it's cheapened over the years.'

It all started when 15-year-old Simpkin's friend showed him photo of her father with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1989.

'I went and bought myself a camera straight away and knew I was onto something,' he said.

'From then on, I got a 20 year head start from everyone else and taking photos with these big names.'

Simpkin said he felt that last year was the right time for him to stop his hobby-turned-profession.

'I lost count many years ago,' he said.

'I think I stopped counting after 2000.'

The star snapper reminisced on some of the most memorable moments and said Michael Jackson was one of his best.

Having said that, the 40-year-old is also getting a taste of fame.

'It's come full circle now,' he said.

'People are now asking for my photo and just the other day I look about 150 selfies with the general public after a talk show.'

His exhibition, Richard and Famous is at Westfield shopping centre in Bondi Junction until May 22.
