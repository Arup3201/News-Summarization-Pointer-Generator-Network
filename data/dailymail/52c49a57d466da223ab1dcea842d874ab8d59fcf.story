Over the years, political correctness has seeped into many areas of every day life. 

Christmas time in particular is a period where every effort is made to include even those of non-Christian faiths in the festive cheer. 

So, with the huge growth sales of Crimbo sweaters over the last few years, it was only a matter of time before someone invented the 'Multicultural Christmas Jumper.'

A British website is selling the Multicultural Christmas jumper for £40. The company wants to make season a time for celebration and togetherness

And the website Britishchristmasjumpers.com are the first past that particular politically correct finishing post. 

Their multicoloured offering features several different signs of faith including; Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Sikh, a form of scientific atheism, Chinese philosophy and also the peace sign.

The woolly garment can be pre-ordered from the site for £40, with the company shipping the prodcuts from December 1 onwards. 

A spokesperson for the company said: 'For us, the festive season is a time for celebration and togetherness. And we think that now more than ever, the world could use a little more unity.

'Which is why this year, British Christmas Jumpers has made the Multicultural Christmas Jumper. 

'It is a Christmas jumper for modern Britain.'

They claim it is a sweater for 'Modern Britain'

The website reads: 'Britain has never been more multicultural, so we thought we’d create a Christmas jumper with a twist

'We think everyone should be able to wear a British Christmas Jumper and celebrate the festive season - however they wish, no matter what their colour, creed or culture. 

'This is why you’ll see all the world's major religions represented on this Christmas jumper, proudly made in Britain.'
