A daring duo took their lives in their hands to scale a spectacular frozen waterfall as it melted beneath their feet.

The climb in Ouray, Colorado, was certainly not for the faint of heart, with one wrong step potentially sending them sliding nearly 100ft to almost certain death at the foot of the sheer ice sheet.

But that didn't stop this pair of daredevils rising to the challenge.

Heartstopping: Photographer Alain Denis captures
his partner Calixte Leblanc taking on the frozen waterfall climb in 
Ouray, Colorado

Slippery: One wrong step could have sent Mr Leblanc plunging nearly 100ft down the frozen waterfall to almost certain death at its frozen base

Don't look down! After the climb Mr Denis spoke 
of the intoxicating mixture of adrenaline and fear that possessed him 
and Mr Leblanc when they first saw the ice column

Adventure: The frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall

Adventure sport photographer Alain 
Denis, 40, captured these spectacular images of his partner Calixte 
Leblanc, 32, taking on the ascent.

Using
ice tools, ice screws, crampons and a harness, brave Mr Denis and his 
climbing compatriot were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a 
mere twenty minutes.

'This 
was the first time we were able to climb the frozen waterfall,' said Mr 
Denis. 'In the previous years, the [ice] never got fat enough for us to 
do it, or didn't reach all the way to the ground.

'When
we first saw it like this it looked scary, but looking back at 
photographs reminds me of the excitement we had when we first saw this 
free standing pillar, the adrenaline and fear of climbing it.'

The
frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region 
nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall.

Great outdoors: This photograph of the climb from another angle shows just how precarious the ascent of the waterfall was

Kitted out: Using ice tools, ice screws, crampons and a harness, brave Mr Denis and Mr Leblanc were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a mere twenty minutes

First ascent: Mr Denis explained that in previous years the column had not been substantial enough to climb, or had not reached all the way to the ground

Dramatic: Mr Leblanc swings his ice axe as he inches his way to the top of the waterfall, which apparently collapsed only a few weeks later

Talking about the climb, Mr Denis explained: 'Once we got back to the car park at the bottom of the mountain, a local told us that we had just completed the first accent of the frozen waterfall.

'We later found out that only a few more ascents were completed after us, and several weeks later the pillar fell down

'I always loved adrenaline sports, loved to be in the mountains and be in nature.

'I fell in love with climbing before I had even tried it; I was hooked as soon as I brought my first climbing harness.'

I thought Global Warming was going to put an end to this foolishness.

Every year they spray water on the rocks and overhangs to create these ice walls for climbers...they even have a children's one!  It is all done with safety as paramount.....hundreds of people of various ages do this every year.....

The people giving you red arrows need to check their facts before they start rating. Ouray absolutely does spray the rocks with water to create ice climbs. Ice climbing in Ouray is a HUGE part of that towns economy, and they even have an Ice Climbing Festival every year. 

If you red arrowed or think you want to red arrow mobilemaz  then I suggest you go to Google and look up the Ouray Ice Park. Go to their Technical Facts and see where the water comes from.
