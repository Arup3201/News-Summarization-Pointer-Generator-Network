Cesc Fabregas put on another passing masterclass on Friday.

The maestro made 103 passes - more than West Ham’s midfielders and forwards combined - and was involved all over, as his pitch map shows.

Despite that, it was still not his best of the season. In only seven matches has a player made more than 103 passes, and three of those totals came from Fabregas.

His record was 144 against West Brom last month.

Fabregas has been in excellent form since returning to the Premier League with Chelsea after signing from Barcelona.

The Spain international has already notched up 12 assists this season – that is more than Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere has created in his entire Arsenal career.
