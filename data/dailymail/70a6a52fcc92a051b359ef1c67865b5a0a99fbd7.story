The United States soccer team may have been given 'no chance' of winning the World Cup by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy their luxurious Sao Paulo base - while they can.

Arriving in a Sao Paolo crippled by strikes, riots and the worst outbreak of dengue fever in a generation on Monday, captain Clint Dempsey and his team mates checked into the 5-star Hotel Tivoli Sao Paulo Mofarrej under armed guard.

With the Presidential suite at the modernist hotel inspired by the architecture of Brazil's legendary architect, Oscar Niemeyer, costing $1,460 a night, the United States Soccer Federation have spared no expense to make their players comfortable at the world's biggest party.

Good job that is too, because the the US players face an arduous task to make even the final 16, having been drawn in the so-called 'Group of Death' along with Germany, Portugal and perennial rivals Ghana.

Far-flung games from the northeastern coast to the humid Amazon rainforest will force the US team to fly about 9,000 miles in three round-trip flights between the matches and their base in Sao Paulo.

The US soccer team checked into the downtown hotel after arriving on a bus draped with the flag and slogan, 'United by team, driven by passion'.

With 219 rooms, there is more than enough room to cope with the unprecedented demand for hotels across Brazil, as the soccer-mad nation prepares to host largest sporting event on Earth.

Standard: A more modest but nonetheless impressive hotel room more like where the US Soccer players will be based during the World Cup

Sophisticated: Even the bathrooms at the Sao Paulo hotel exude a level of class that befits the United States' 7th consecutive appearance at the World Cup

Welcome: The main lobby at the Tivoli São Paulo Mofarrej has been heavily renovated to match the hotel's claim to be one of the most chic in modernist Sao Paulo

While the chaotic metropolis of Sao Paulo's 12 million residents rages outside, the players will be able to relax at the hotel's famous Elements Spa - that has both Brazilian and Thai massage therapists, skilled in promoting physical and spiritual well-being.

All guests are greeted with a fruit bowl and receive a nightly turndown service complete with a square of honey cake and the next day’s weather report - which will not be needed to predict the staggering heat of the north, where the US plays all three group games.

The pool at the hotel appears to be filled with orange Fanta, but is actually an optical illusion created by the use of tangerine-hued glass tiles according to Luxury Latin America.

Food at the hotel is provided by two-star Michelin chef, Sergi Arola. Who since November 2009 has presided over  the Arola-Vintretes restaurant, which serves creative Mediterranean-influenced cuisine along with an extensive menu of tapas. The dining room, which also has a posh bar, occupies the 23rd floor.

This is the beautiful 4th-floor Elements Spa operated by the renowned Thai company Banyan Tree. The spa has trained Thai and Brazilian staff

Having practiced at Sao Paulo FC's Frederico Antonio Germano Menzen training center, the players will fly the 1,444 miles to Natal to take on 2010 nemesis Ghana on June 16.

While the temperatures in Sao Paulo in June are around 72 degrees with an average humidity of 78, the climate in Natal and Recife are very different.

Situated on the Atlantic coast, both relatively modern cities hit highs of 85 degrees in June and the average humidity is 80 percent.

That is nothing compared to Manaus, described as a 'bustling frontier outpost of the modern, industrial world on a distant, jungle planet, 1,671 miles from Sao Paulo'.

Manaus is surrounded on three sides by mostly impassible jungle and on the other by rivers: the enormous Rio Negro and the almost unimaginably more powerful Amazon River.

When you step off the plane, even the air can seem other-worldly, a hot, humid blast that feels like steam - so much so that physical effort can be utterly exhausting.

A local delicacy is the toxic soup, tacacá.

It is made from the wild cassava root common to the Amazon. To eat the wild cassava, you have to squeeze out the juice and boil it, which removes its toxic qualities.

The result is a yellowish cooking broth packed with nutrients that Amazon tribes call tucupi. Tacacá is hot tucupi with dried shrimp and jambú, a spinach-like green that briefly numbs the tongue.

Just to complete their group, the US soccer team will have flown 9,000 or so miles over ten days to and from Sao Paulo taking on Ghana, Portugal and the best player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo and then finally, the might of Germany.

Choosing to be based in Sao Paolo to take advantage of the modern facilities may seem foolish, especially in light of the continuing problems between Brazilian police and striking subway workers.

They clashed on Monday on a station not far from the US hotel and are threatening to maintain the work stoppage through the World Cup opening match here this week.

Authorities are deeply worried about the strike because the subway is the main means of transportation for World Cup fans who will attend Thursday's opening match when Brazil takes on Croatia.

Riot police firing tear gas forced about 100 striking workers out of the station as the strike threw Sao Paulo's normally congested traffic into chaos for a fifth day. About half of the city's subway stations were operating, but with greatly diminished service.

'This is the way they negotiate, with tear gas and repression,' said Alexandre Roland, a union leader, as he and others regrouped outside the station after confronting riot police.

Altino Prazeres, president of the union leading the strike, said as he marched along with workers on a street in central Sao Paulo that 'we are not interested in ruining the World Cup.'

'I love soccer! I support our national team. The point is not to stop the Cup,' he said. 'We want to resolve this today and all are willing to negotiate.'

Ultimately, the days are long gone when it was a surprise for the United States to reach the World Cup finals, but for a country used to sporting success they are still some way short of making a major impact on the tournament.

It remains one of the final sporting frontiers for the United States to conquer although they reached the semi-finals in 1930 and caused one of soccer's greatest upsets when they beat England the last time that the World Cup was held in Brazil in 1950.

Since that inaugural event they have reached the quarter-finals just once, in 2002, although this will be the United States' seventh successive appearance in the finals, a consistent run bettered only by Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Germany, Spain and South Korea.

The U.S. have a solid team with a lot of depth in the midfield and an experienced coach who knows what it takes to win the sport's ultimate prize.

They have also recorded confidence-boosting victories against European opposition since Klinsmann took over in 2011, including Germany, Italy and world champions Spain.

'I look at things always from a positive side. We have a young team, a team that is growing. We've built a lot over the past two years,' Klinsmann said.

'We've had the most successful year in our history in 2013, so we've built the confidence and the belief that we can deal with those challenges.

We're going to take it one game at a time, starting with Ghana who gave us some issues in the recent World Cups. If we start off there well, then it builds even more confidence for the next two big ones.'
