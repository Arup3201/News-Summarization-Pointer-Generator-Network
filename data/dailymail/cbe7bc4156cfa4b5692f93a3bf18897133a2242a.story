Former First Lady Valérie Trierweiler (pictured) may be forced to undergo the psychiatric examination by the lawyers of the man she allegedly slapped

The former French first lady may be forced to undergo psychiatric evaluation by the lawyers representing the right-wing politician she allegedly slapped after he asked her about François Hollande.

Valérie Trierweiler 50, allegedly slapped junior politician Mohamed Rizki in a Paris café last Thursday - and now his lawyers say they will seek to have a psychiatrist examine her to gauge her level of 'dangerousness.'

Junior right wing politician Mohamed Rizki claims he had just asked after her former partner, President Hollande.

He said: 'I simply asked her, "how is François?"

'Honestly, it was a simple question, without a second thought.' 

Mr Rizki's lawyer branded her reaction as 'totally disproportionate', adding that given Ms Trierweiler's alleged previous assault on  French finance minister's wife, 'we are entitled to question the state of her psychiatric health and her level of dangerousness'.

Lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told Le Parisien newspaper: 'As the legal system allows us to do in affairs of this nature, we are therefore going to request an expert psychiatric assessment to be carried out on Ms Trierweiler.'

Ms Trierweiler, whose kiss-and-tell book about her relationship with the French president deeply embarrassed Mr Hollande, allegedly struck   outside a café. 

Mr Rizki has insisted there was no sarcasm in his question but that the ex-first lady, who is nicknamed 'The Rottweiler,' reacted 'very aggressively' and demanded an apology.

'She was very, very hysterical. And then she slapped me before turning on her heels,' he told Le Parisien. 

The incident took place near her home in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, which she once shared with Mr Hollande. 

Mr Rizki, 33, made a formal complaint to police and has now demanded a public apology.

After news of the alleged slap was reported, Ms Trierweiler wrote on Twitter: 'Un seul mot #Stopàlamuflerie', which translates as 'One word #Stopboorishness'. 

Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, is notorious for her short temper and has been accused of being violent in the past.

In September it was reported she slapped the ex-wife of Finance Minister Michel Sapin, after scratching her face and pulling her hair in a late night bar, the Telegraph reports.

Her tell-all book, Thank You For This Moment: A Story Of Love, Power And Betrayal, depicts Mr Hollande as a deceitful, heartless hypocrite who mocks the poor and is set to be made into a film.

The couple split last year after Mr Hollande's affair with actress Julie Gayet was revealed. 

Ms Trierweiler was rumoured to have gone on a rampage in the Elysee Palace after learning of Mr Hollande’s infidelity, smashing up more than £2.5million worth of vases, clocks and paintings, which were all part of France’s national heritage.

Since leaving the Elysee she has been working extremely hard to improve her public image, but remains unpopular in France.

She has also been accused of using her position as a former presidential consort to make as much cash as possible.
