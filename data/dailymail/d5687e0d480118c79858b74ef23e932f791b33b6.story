Read Charles Sale's story about Mark Clattenburg being axed for this week's Premier League games after breaking protcol to see an Ed Sheeran concert

The match officials travel rules Mark Clattenburg flouted last weekend were brought in because me and my heavily pregnant wife were threatened and abused by two thugs after a game at Middlesbrough.

One of them even made gesture as if to shoot me.

Back then we used to drive ourselves to games, park in the club car park and walk to the ground. Unfortunately after Boro played Arsenal in 1995, two supporters approached me in a very aggressive manner.

Mark Clattenburg will not officiate next weekend's games after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games

Clattenburg drove alone to West Brom v Crystal Palace at the weekend so he could see Ed Sheeran perform

Warnock wanted to discuss the incident that saw Julian Speroni (centre)  injured in a clash with Craig Dawson

The procedure for match-day officials is:

1. Match officials must meet at the designated hotel which is relatively close to the ground four hours before the advertised kick-off of the game they are due to officiate

2. They have a meeting room for their use and have full refreshments available to them

3. All four officials must attend and generally they will discuss the upcoming match, any previous history and individual knowledge that will be useful in the management of the match

4. Their cars are left at this hotel for safety and security. There is a people carrier laid on for transport to the ground which drops the officials off at the players' entrance

5. The same is done in reverse for the journey home

I was only able to escape physical harm due to the quick thinking of one of my guests.

There are a number of historic incidents of referees' cars being vandalised - this wasn’t helped by the fact that some referees choose to have personalised number plates.

But after this Boro incident it was clear our safety was in question and something had to change.

Arsenal won that game 3-2 and I had sent off Alan Moore late on. After the game, I had a drink in the lounge which was standard practice before heading to my guest's car, with my wife in tow. 

It was dark and just as we got to the car, two supporters started shouting obscenities at me and calling me biased because I was a southerner. One went inside his pockets and made a gun motion to my head.

At this moment, my guest opened the car and got my wife in. I used my kit-bag to protect myself from an incoming punch, threw the bag in the car and then drove away. 

On the Monday after I filed a report to my superiors and at the next meeting of referees - we met every fortnight - the issue of safety was raised. I wasn't the only referee to suffer trouble - I remember another ref had his car attacked after he got stuck in traffic on Tottenham High Road.

It is also alleged that Clattenburg had a telephone conversation with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock in his car and this was facilitated by him not using the people carrier back to the hotel after the game. 

The reason these conversation should not be taking place on a one-to-one basis is that there are no witnesses to protect the referee over allegations of what he is supposed to have said or not said. 

Clattenburg should be well aware of this after two previous cases of his, the John Mikel Obi incident at Chelsea and the Adam Lallana row at Southampton.

It quickly became apparent that we had to change our rules and adopt the system in place from UEFA for European games, where British refs obviously didn't have their cars and were escorted to and from the ground along with their officials.  

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the governing body of Premier League referees, therefore changed their rules for the start of 1996-97 season and set the new protocols for a very good reason.

Clattenburg knows this and should adhere to that protocol.

Last weekend, after officiating West Brom’s game with Crystal Palace, he chose to ignore a very straightforward system designed for his personal safety and his integrity - and that of his colleagues.

The procedures mean:

For West Brom matches, the hotel used to be just one mile away from The Hawthorns. However, this has been changed to a city centre hotel in Birmingham that is still only four miles from the ground. So there was really no need for Clattenburg not to take the people carrier – even if he was keen to get up to Tyneside for a pop concert.

Clattenburg was cleared of allegedly making inappropriate comments to John Mikel Obi in 2012

The vast majority of officials adhere to the official protocol. However, there were odd occasions when I did something similar due to personal commitments.

I remember leaving Loftus Road and getting on the Tube into central London to go to a concert with my wife which, in hindsight, wasn’t wise. 

On another occasion I did feel it was right for me to break the protocol after a Premier League match at Chelsea in 1996 because I had to get to Heathrow airport to fly to Europe for a UEFA tournament. I was given permission to take my own car to Stamford Bridge and follow a police car immediately after the game to get me to Heathrow in time for my flight.

It is very difficult planning a life outside of your refereeing duties when you only find out at 3pm on Monday which game you have the following weekend – so I do have some sympathy for Clattenburg.

ADAM LALLANA ROW (January 2014)

Clattenburg was cleared by the FA after Southampton complained about comments he made to midfielder Adam Lallana - which were first revealed in Sportsmail.  

JOHN MIKEL OBI RACE ROW (October 2012)  

Clattenburg was accused of using 'inappropriate language' towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi during their 3-2 defeat by Manchester United. Clattenburg was eventually cleared after investigations from the FA and Metropolitan Police. Mikel was fined £60,000 and given a three-match ban for threatening Clattenburg after the match.

CRAIG BELLAMY ROW (Decemeber 2009)

Clattenburg sent Bellamy off for two yellow cards in a match between Manchester City and Bolton, having earlier asked the City bench: 'How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?'

SACKED OVER BUSINESS DEALINGS (August 2008)

He was sacked by the PGMOL board after allegations he owed £60,000 following a failed business deal. In February 2009, after an appeal, he was reinstated as a Select Group Referee but suspended for eight months from August 6 - the date of his original ban - for 'issues relating to his private business affairs'.

PEDRO MENDES 'GOAL' (January 2005)

Clattenburg and his assistants failed to award a Pedro Mendes goal for Tottenham at Old Trafford, despite the ball clearly going over the line before Manchester United keeper Roy Carroll fumbled it clear.
