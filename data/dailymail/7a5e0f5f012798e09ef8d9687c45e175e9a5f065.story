Police say they are treating the discovery of two bodies in a village today as 'unexplained'.

A member of the public found the bodies in a Fenland field in Thorney, near Peterborough, at about 11.30am and immediately called police.

They are believed to have been found in a narrow track close to the Dog In A Doublet pub.

Scenes of crime officers have cordoned off the area and Cambridgeshire Constabulary said they are not able to give any details about the identity of the bodies.

Police are searching surrounding fields and a dinghy was also seen being towed to the site.

A force spokesman said: 'We were called just before 
11.30am by a member of the public following the discovery of two bodies 
in Thorney.

'The deaths are being treated as unexplained at this time.'

Ashley Seward-Morris, who manages the pub, said the bodies were discovered in Thorney Dyke.

He told Mail Online: 'This is quiet, friendly village and things like this don't really happen round here.

'It has been quite a shock.

'They were found in Thorney Dyke, which is just around the back of our pub. It is fairly close.'

The
bodies were discovered just ten miles from the A16 in Newborough, 
Cambridgeshire, where Kevin Lee was found stabbed to death on Saturday.

Investigators said they are keeping an 'open mind' as to whether today's discovery is linked, according to Heart News.
