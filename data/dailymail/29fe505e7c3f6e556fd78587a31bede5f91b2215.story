Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters are far away from the eye of Hurricane Sandy, yet for employees of the social networking company, the storm hit home.

After nearly six months of watching helplessly as the value of Facebook's stock crumbled, Facebook employees finally got the greenlight to cash in some of their stock on Monday as the 'lock-up' on trading them expired.

Unfortunately, any would-be sellers will have to wait a little longer, as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were both closed on Monday because of Sandy, the exchanges' first weather-related shutdown in 27 years.

Vacant: The New York Stock Exchange floor will be closed on Monday as Hurricane Sandy churns up the coastline

Both exchanges said they would remain closed on Tuesday as well, pending confirmation.

Roughly 234 million shares of Facebook stock owned by company employees were eligible for trading on Monday.

Facebook had moved up the lock-up expiration date for employees by a few weeks, a move that analysts said could help bolster morale among the company's rank-and-file who have been unable to sell shares even as other insiders and early investors have sold.

The end of the employee lock-up also comes as Facebook's stock has been on the rise, gaining more than 12 per cent last week after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results.

Facebook shares closed Friday's regular session at $21.94.

The world's Number 1 online social network became the first U.S. company to debut on the public markets with a valuation of more than $100 billion.

But Facebook's May initial public offering has been marked by a series of setbacks, including a glitch with the Nasdaq on its first day of trading and controversial revelations that the company had pre-briefed analysts for its underwriters ahead of the IPO, advising them to reduce their profit and revenue forecasts.

Prepared: The NYSE opened a day after Hurricane Irene reached NYC last year but that storm hit on a Sunday rather than the start of the business week

Shares of Facebook, which were priced at $38 in the IPO, declined to as low of $17.55 in September as investors fretted about its slowing revenue growth and limited mobile advertising revenue.

The implications of the closure of the stock exchange for Facebook workers came as New Yorkers hunkered down for the worst of Hurricane Sandy.

It will be the first time since 1888 that the New York Stock Exchange will have been closed for two consecutive days because of bad weather.

While the NYSE is closing the Nasdaq which relies on electronic trading will stay open

The cause then was a blizzard that left drifts as high as 40 feet in the streets of New York City.

Much of the East Coast was at a standstill Monday as the storm approached. Mass transit and schools were closed across the region ahead of the storm hitting land, which was expected to happen later Monday.

Areas around the Financial District were part of a mandatory evacuation zone. The storm surge is already pushing water over seawalls in the southern tip of Manhattan.

After the NYSE closed Monday, traders continued to work  by buying and selling shares electronically.

The
New York Mercantile Exchange, a commodity futures exchange, will also close its trading floor on Monday as it is located in a mandatory 
evacuation zone.

Rare: The NYSE floor rarely closes for weather with the last major stop in trading coming in after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks

Stay home: Along with the NYSE most New York transportation is on hold and schools are closed as the city waits for Sandy

The CME Group, which owns NYMEX, said all electronic 
markets will open at their regularly scheduled times.

Last year the NYSE opened the day after Hurricane Irene’s Sunday arrival, but as Sandy is expected to hit on Monday its unsure how long the closure may last.

Sandy, a Category 1 hurricane with 
sustained winds of 75 mph as of Sunday afternoon, had already claimed 65 lives in the Caribbean before it began churning up the Eastern 
Seaboard.

Hurricane Sandy has forced the shutdown of transportation 
systems throughout New York and public schools. Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York 
City's subways and buses will shut down Sunday evening and will remain closed until further notice.
