Energy bills will still be higher than last winter, even after the government agreed cuts to controversial green levies which will save customers £50.

Most of the Big Six had already announced rise of more than £100 this winter, before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes.

Now British Gas has said it will cut bills by £53 in January, SSE bills will fall by £50, while EDF said it would hold prices until 2015, but ministers admitted prices could still rise again.

Checking the bill: Details of handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy-saving measures have been revealed (file picture)

Chancellor
 George Osborne has sealed a deal which will see the taxpayer shoulder 
the cost of some schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable 
insulate their homes.

Ministers stress that they have never promised to cut bills overall, insisting they can only act to reduce the costs of government policy.

The taxpayer is to pick up part of the cost of environmental programmes in a package of measures to be unveiled by the Chancellor in Thursday's Autumn statement.

They again dismissed Labour's promise to freeze bills as a 'con' because it is impossible to control global energy prices.

The Government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation (ECO), an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers, in a move that should shave £30-£35 off bills, on average, next year.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change also announced it is establishing a rebate, saving the average customer £12 on their bill for the next two years.

Electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014-15, funding a one-off reduction of around £5 on electricity bills.

In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out.

BRITISH GAS

Winter 2013 price rise: 10 per cent, adding £131 on average standard dual fuel tariff

New cut: £53, in January 2014

NPOWER

Winter 2013 price rise: 10 per cent, adding £139 on average standard dual fuel tariff

New cut: Is calculating size of cut. Promises a freeze in prices until spring 2015, provided wholesale energy costs or network charges do not rise

SSE

Winter 2013 price rise: 8 per cent, adding £106 on average standard dual fuel tariff

New cut: 4 per cent cut for average dual-fuel customer, saving around £50, coming into effect by the end of March

EDF

Winter 2013 price rise: 4 per cent, adding £52 on average standard dual fuel tariff

New cut: Says it took into account the prospect of cuts in green levies when it set a lower price rise

SCOTTISH POWER

Winter 2013 price rise: 8 per cent, adding £112 on average standard dual fuel tariff

New cut: Yet to announce details

Winter 2013 price rise: Did not announce a price rise at the same time as the other Big Six

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'Consumers are the ones who are winning today with an average of £50 off household energy bills, we’ve managed to do that by protecting the fuel poor… and we’ve done that by maintaining our green energy policies.'

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'One thing I think people have missed a bit is our very fierce competition policies.

'We’ve been working with Ofgem to increase competition in the retail sector. Which is why we’ve seen a lot of new firms come to supply energy.

'Labour reduced the number of firms in their time – Ed Miliband and Labour reduced the number of firms and created the Big Six.

'The Big Six are Labour’s creation. Under the Coalition we’ve seen a whole group of new people coming in to compete and winning customers off the Big Six.

'The Big Six may not like that, but this Government is in favour of competition.'

But he later admitted that if wholesale prices rise, costs to customers will go up again.

'As the major energy companies have now confirmed there will be no need for price rises in 2014 unless of course there is a major change in wholesale or network costs,' he told MPs.

Today the firms gave details of how the savings would be passed on.

Npower said it would reduce its bills and is calculating what the saving will mean for customers.

British Gas put up electricity prices by 10.4 per cent and gas by 8.4 per cent two weeks ago.

But today it said it would roll back some of those rises, cutting the average dual-fuel bill by £43 and reducing the Warm Home Discount scheme by £12.

Managing director Chris Weston said: 'British Gas is pleased to be cutting energy bills by an average of £53 from January 1.

'We've been able to do this because the Government has committed to making changes to the environmental and social obligations that are paid for through energy bills. These changes will now allow us to help more people at a lower cost.'

Npower said it would pass on the savings, and promised not to push up prices again before spring 2015.

Paul Massara, CEO at RWE npower, said: 'As a result of this announcement we will reduce our bills.

'We are currently calculating how large this reduction will be, and can assure our customers that it will fully reflect the reduction in the costs to our business.

'In addition, in order to give our customers greater certainty with their household budgets, we don't plan to increase energy prices before spring 2015, unless there are increases in wholesale energy costs or network charges.'

Scottish & Southern Energy said it expects a saving for the typical dual-fuel customer of around 4 per cent before the end of March, equivalent to a saving of around £50 for a typical dual-fuel customer.

EDF said its ‘decision to hold back the full impact of rising costs’ earlier this month by implementing lower rise than competitors had been ‘validated by the conformation that the Government will take action on energy changes’.

‘Customers should expect other energy suppliers to follow EDF’s lead by significantly lowering their prices,’ he said.

Ministers have been scrambling to find a way to deal with rising energy costs since Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to freeze bills for two years if he wins the 2015 election.

David Cameron dismissed the plan as a 'con' but action to reduce the cost of gas and electricity proved popular with voters.

The government focussed on the impact of government policy, in particular to green levies which are added to bills used to fund schemes to make homes more energy efficient.

Ministers hailed today's deal as a 'serious,
workable package which would save households around £50 on average'.

But Labour's shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'If
 David Cameron and Nick Clegg think just doing what the energy companies
 ask of them is the answer to bills being too high they are wrong.

'Energy bills have gone up by £120 this winter alone, so even with a £50 
cut in levies, people’s bills will still be higher this winter than last
 year.

'The real reason bills are rising year on year without 
justification is because the energy market is broken. Instead of bailing
 out the energy companies, David Cameron should stand up to them and 
stop them overcharging people.'

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the plan was a 'serious, workable package' but Labour's Caroline Flint said bills would still be higher than last winter

Mr Osborne yesterday said he was 
certain that the average £50 saving from slashing the Energy Company 
Obligation would be passed on by energy firms to consumers.

He
 said: ‘This will help families. We’ve been in discussions with the 
energy companies. We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be 
brought in.’

Asked how £1,000 grants for homebuyers to improve energy efficiency and cuts to environmental levies on bills would be funded, Mr Osborne replied: ‘The money will come from additional taxes that we will raise from dealing with tax avoidance.’

He refused to give details of the tax avoidance crackdown but said people were wrong to be sceptical about whether such action really raised revenue.

‘This government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament,’ he said.

The Chancellor attacked Labour’s pledge of a 20-month freeze on energy prices if they win the election - which has been dominating the political agenda since Ed Miliband announced it in September.
