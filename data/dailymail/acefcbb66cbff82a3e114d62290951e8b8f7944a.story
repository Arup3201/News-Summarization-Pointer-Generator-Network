For centuries, they been a source of national pride – as well as some good-humoured merriment.

And for those who feared Britain’s regional accents may be dying out, take heart - as it appears they will be with us for a good few years yet.

From the Scottish brogue to the Welsh lilt, new research shows local accents are actually getting stronger as people struggle to retain a sense of identity.

Experts had originally predicted that local dialects would die out in the last half century with the rise of social mobility -  but the study shows the opposite is true.

On the up: Researchers at Aston University in Birmingham have found accents are getting stronger

Researchers at Aston University say people are now choosing to hang on to the way their parents and grandparents speak as a marker of local allegiance.

They say accents no longer hold a stigma and instead allow people to feel more connected with where they were brought up.

Dr Urszula Clark of Aston University, who lead the project, said: ‘The implications of our research are far reaching, revealing how far people’s relationships with linguistic variety have changed.

‘Rather than being a mark of social stigma, people are choosing certain features of accent or dialect to mark an identity with a particular place, instead of with a particular social class or ethnic group.’

The study, on people living in the West Midlands, showed many chose to use dialect and accent forms deliberately and self-consciously.

This finding is consistent with research undertaken by other researchers in the UK in relation to those living in Bristol, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield.

The research indicates that drawing upon linguistic features of a particular variety, such as Black Country English, cuts across ethnicity, gender and class boundaries.

However, while speaking with a regional accent is socially acceptable in the world of entertainment and sport, the study found there is some snobbery in areas like education, the law and government.

The West Midlands English: Speech and Society project was set up to investigate and describe the range of accents and dialects of the West Midlands today.

The research looked at the ways in which performers, including comedians, poets, and dramatists, used accent as a way of expressing a place identity.

Researchers attended 20 performances at local venues across the Midlands and interviewed the performers as well as audience members.

Dr Clark added: ‘The reasoning behind the project is to draw the wider public’s attention to the change in people’s relationships with linguistic variety.

‘This is not to say anything goes: a regional variation of English is linguistically just as rule governed as standard English, but with different rules, which in many cases can be traced back historically to Middle English, a time pre-dating the emergence of standard English.’
