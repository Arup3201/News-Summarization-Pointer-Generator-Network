Doreen Banks joined the club in 1961, after being encouraged by her late husband to take up the sport

In failing health and reliant on a buggy to get around the course, pensioner Doreen Banks thought her best golfing moments were behind her.

But more than five decades after taking up the game, the jubilant widow is celebrating her first hole-in-one - at the grand old age of 85.

The achievement makes Mrs Banks one of the oldest golfers in the country to score a hole-in-one - and the octogenarian triumphed despite the fact she is slowly going blind.

Mrs Banks managed the feat on a 110-yard par three hole at Oxley Park Golf Club in Wolverhampton earlier this month.

The pensioner joined the club in 1961 after being encouraged to take up the game by her late husband, Colin, who had become a member the previous year. She aced the course’s tricky sixth hole using a five wood, watched by playing partner Pat Rogers, 71.

Mrs Banks said she originally thought she had lost the ball until her friend found it in the hole.

She added: ‘Fellow golfers will laugh, but I actually used my five wood because I don’t hit the ball very far these days.

‘But it does go straight so I just gripped down the club shaft and hit it more in hope than judgement.

‘This golf club has been a major part of my life and I now need a buggy to enable me to play at all, but I was more than happy to buy drinks in the bar for all my fellow members when I got back in after my round.’

Mrs Banks, who lives in Wolverhampton, is a former PE teacher who represented England three times at hockey before switching sports in 1961.

She said: ‘By then, I was finding it harder to run around the hockey field, but with golf, of course, there is none of that.’

She said her husband, an engineer, had joined the Oxley Park club in 1960, adding: ‘Colin would leave for a round of golf each Saturday and Sunday morning at 9am and I would expect him home at around 1pm - but it rarely happened.

‘I didn’t know about the 19th hole in those days. In the end I just decided to join him.’

Mr Banks died aged 75 in 2002. The couple had no children. Mrs Banks said he would be ‘very proud’ of her achievement.

The pensioner suffers from peripheral neuropathy, a relatively common condition where the peripheral nervous system - which controls motor and sensory nerves, as well as those which regulate automatic bodily functions such as blood pressure, bladder function and sweat levels.

It affects eight per cent of people 55 and over and can cause numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, shooting pains and a loss of co-ordination in the affected body parts.

Although Mrs Banks needs a golf buggy to navigate the course and needs glasses to see, she still drives herself to the course and plays a full round most weeks.

She is now an honorary member of the club, which she said meant ‘no more fees to pay’, and was Ladies’ captain there in 1973. Mrs Banks was also formerly captain, president and secretary of Staffordshire Ladies County Golf Association, winning the national trophy in 1993.

Oxley Park Golf Club manager Neville Thomson said: ‘Doreen is a long standing and revered member of the club and everybody is absolutely thrilled with her achievement.

‘What makes this really special is how long she has been at the one club and how long she has been trying.

‘A lot of golfers will never get a hole in one. There is always a celebration and the tradition is for the player who got it to buy everyone they are playing with a drink.’

The oldest golfer ever recorded to have made a hole-in-one was 102-year-old Elsie McLean on April 5, 2007. She holed out with a driver on the 100-yard fourth hole at Bidwell Park, in Chico, California.
