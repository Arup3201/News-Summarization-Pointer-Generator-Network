Pay back: Chef Jim Knight, pictured, hijacked the Plough Inn pub's Twitter account after he was fired for requesting time off over Christmas

Fired from the village pub after asking for Christmas Day off, chef Jim Knight had the perfect recipe for revenge.

The new father took to The Plough’s Twitter account to share his feelings with the world – and claim the pub bought supermarket meat which it passed off as high-quality cuts.

The 28-year-old first posted: ‘We’d like to inform you that we’ve just fired our head chef’, swiftly followed by: ‘Unfortunately he wanted to have a weekend off this month and Christmas Day this year for family commitments so we thought we’d sack him.’

He then tweeted in quick succession: ‘Yeah a week before Christmas!’, ‘We don’t care that he has a 7 1/2 month old baby daughter’ and then: ‘So anyway come on down and continue to pay a premium for Australian sirloins, New Zealand lamb and everything else that is bought from Asda.’

Mr Knight, who has a daughter called Daisy with partner Louise Thompson, 24, had worked at the community-owned pub in Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, for three months.

He posted the messages to the pub's 2,200 followers, and they were quickly retweeted by hundreds of Twitter users in a matter of hours.

On
 his own Twitter account, Mr Knight explained his actions, writing: 
'It's my daughters first Christmas. I wouldn't miss that for ANYTHING.'

The
 chef, who has written pieces for the Telegraph, then added that he 
didn't hack into the pub's Twitter account as he was the one who set it 
up.

Mr
 Knight wrote: 'I would like to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR I have not 
"hacked" any account. I created the account with permission of my 
ex-employers. Night x'

Response: The Plough landlord Steve Potts today claimed it was made clear to Mr Knight he would have to work Sundays and denied allegations the pub's meat is purchased from Asda

After
 thousands of people online offered support in response to his rant on 
Sunday night he wrote on his personal Twitter account: ‘Right, night 
everyone. Thank you for the kind words. I had no idea this would 
escalate so quickly. See you in the job centre.’

Landlord
 Steve Potts yesterday confirmed that Mr Knight was sacked for refusing 
to work on Christmas Day and on Sundays in the near future. He said that
 breached an understanding reached when Mr Knight was first employed.

Mr Potts 
said: ‘When Jim, as head chef, informed me that he would not be working I
 was left with little choice but to end our arrangement. I had been 
quite clear with him when he started here that Sundays are our busiest 
days of the week and that all our chefs have to work that day.’

Roasting: The new father took to The Plough¿s Twitter account to share his feelings with the world ¿ and claim the pub bought supermarket meat which it passed off as high-quality cuts

He
 also vehemently denied the claim that the pub’s produce is bought from 
supermarkets, saying it is fresh and comes from high-end suppliers and 
local farmers.

'Our
 suppliers are transparent: our meat is fresh, never frozen, and comes 
from Booker’s in High Wycombe and from a local farmer called Peter Vogt,
 ' he said.

'Certain 
staples of fish come from our nearest supermarket, which is Asda, but 
the implied suggestion that we are buying cheap meat and passing it off 
at a premium is, frankly, outrageous and untrue.'

He added that The Plough employs three 
other chefs, all of whom are remaining in their post to ensure a full 
service over the Christmas period.

But Mr Potts admitted he is now recruiting another head chef.

He
 continued: 'I’ve been in this business 25 years and have a lot of 
contacts who have been asking me on an ongoing basis if there is a 
position available, as this is a fantastic pub to work for.

'Since
 the villagers bought it out two years ago, it’s been renovated to a 
wonderful standard, the kitchen facilities are second to none and it 
must be one of the most beautiful villages in the country.'

Mr Knight posted yesterday: ‘I have very kindly been offered a serious job offer directly off the back of this Twitter storm.’

Mr Knight also wrote on his Twitter account that a 'reply statement was inevitable' and he stands by his comments.

The Plough's social media disaster is reminiscent of music retailer HMV's Twitter backlash when staff live-tweeted their own mass firings in February.

Claims: He added that he did not hack the account - but had the login as he had set it up while still employed at the pub
