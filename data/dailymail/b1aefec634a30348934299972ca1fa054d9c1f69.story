The teaching assistant sent home on her first day for having too many tattoos is facing fresh controversy after it emerged that she had posted nude pictures of herself online.

Charlotte Tumilty, 26, was turned away from her trainee role at a Catholic school in Hartlepool when staff took exception to her body art.

The mother-of-two has inkings on her feet, hands and neck and was told they were 'inappropriate'.

Nude photographs have emerged of Charlotte Tumilty, pictured, who claimed she was sent away from her first day working in a Catholic school because of her tattoos

Despite passing an earlier interview, within a hour of starting the position she was told to go home and come back with plasters and bandages covering them up. 

And her future has now been thrown into fresh doubt after erotic photos, some completely nude, appeared on a number of websites.

Miss Tumilty admitted posing for some 'old' pictures when she was aged 18, but has refused to comment further.

Appearing under the name of Charlie Horizon the photos show her in compromising and revealing positions.

In some of the images she can be seen pulling down her trousers to expose her behind, while in many she is completely topless.

On one of the sites, Miss Tumilty says she is 23 and, using poor spelling and punctuation, writes: 'I'm my own person in my own world I lead my own unique style and I dont follow anyone elses fashion trend.

'I have numerous tattoos I am a walking sketch book full of art.

 'I create and design my own clothes.

'I wanna show that a modifide (sic) body can be beautiful.'  

Miss Tumilty is currently on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education.

She was due to undertake the teaching assistant placement at St John Vianneys Primary School in the city twice a week for a year. 

She said earlier this week: 'They showed me to the class I was working in.

'But a woman asked to speak to me in the office and said 'what we need to discuss is you can still see a bit of your neck tattoo peaking out of your top?'

'I suggested wearing a higher-necked top. The woman said 'that's not the point, it's a strictly Catholic school and tattoos are forbidden'.

'She said they do have teachers with tattoos, but they cover them up. 'I said 'yes, I have covered mine up', but the woman said 'to be honest, I don't think it's appropriate'.

'She then suggested I might be able to use plasters and bandages to cover them up. I'd look ridiculous.'

Miss Tumilty has full 'sleeves' of tattoos on her arms and legs, small ones on her fingers, hands, back and chest and an eye emblem on her neck.

She said when she went for an interview at the school to secure her placement staff could see her tattoos - but she did promise to take her piercings out.

School bosses insisted that Miss Tumilty was not told she could not work in the school, but was asked to consider covering up her tattoos and return to her placement later this week.

Deputy headteacher Martin Boagey said: 'The school expects all members of staff to project a professional image and we have a code of conduct, part of which requires members of staff with tattoos to cover them up. 

Miss Tumilty had said she had been invited back to the school, but did not hold out much hope of it working as some of her tattoos were still visible.

The school refused to comment on the photographs and said they stood by their original statement and did not wish to be drawn into anything further on Miss Tumilty's actions.

Hartlepool College of Further Education and the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, which oversees the school, have been contacted for a comment.
