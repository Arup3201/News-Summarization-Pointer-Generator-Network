People in the South of England are more likely to consider themselves unhappy despite reporting far lower rates of mental illness according to a major new study.

The CentreForum tank has collated information from a wide range of government and health services to produce a report on the health of the nation.

Residents in the London Borough of Harrow have reported the lowest levels of mental health issues, compared with Middlesbrough where residents on Teesside are three times more likely to have a psychiatric illness.

However, people living 40 miles up the A19 in Newcastle are four times more likely to die prematurely from a mental health issue compared with people on the Isle of Wight.

Despite this, the researchers have found that people in London, Bedford, Milton Keynes, Brighton and Kent are among the unhappiest in the country.

According to the researchers mental ill health costs UK employers an estimated £30 billion a year where the highest rates of working days lost is in the City of London.

Holly Taggart of CentreForum said: 'This
 is the first ever mental health-specific Atlas of Variation. It focuses
 on unwarranted – or preventable – variations in the mental health and 
wellbeing of England's population, exposing huge differences in people's
 circumstances and access to services.

'One of the most concerning 
findings is that people with serious mental illnesses have significantly
 higher rates of premature mortality.'

Ms Taggart said young people in Middlesbrough are five times more likely not to be in education, training or employment compared with those in Harrow. She said that Teesside residents were three times more likely to have a long term mental illness than those living in the London borough.

'If you have a 
serious mental illness and live in Newcastle upon Tyne, you are four 
times more likely to die prematurely than if you have a serious mental 
health problem but lived in the Isle of Wight.'

The report found that almost nine per cent of people in Stoke on Trent felt worthless compared with just three per cent in Hampshire.

Paul Burstow MP who chaired a mental health commission established by CentreForum told the Sunday Times: 'This report will challenge health professionals in those parts of the country which are so far off the game when it comes to delivering anything like a decent mental health service.'
