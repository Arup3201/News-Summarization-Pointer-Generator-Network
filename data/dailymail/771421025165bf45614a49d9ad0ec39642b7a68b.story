Some people bound out of bed each morning, ready to fight a new day.

For the vast majority of us, however, the sound of the alarm presents more of a challenge â€“ and a survey has revealed the drastic measures we have to take to ensure we crawl out from under the covers in time to catch our train or bus.

The poll found one in three workers finds getting up so difficult that they put their alarm clock on the other side of the room to force them out of bed.

Almost one in ten workers has been sacked or warned about being late because of missing their alarm

And the survey for breakfast cereal firm Fuel Your 10K Hours found that a similar number choose a loud, piercing noise for their alarm to startle themselves into action, and one in 10 set an 'annoying' song to start their day.

Nevertheless, the average Briton still snoozes for 14 minutes after their alarm goes off at 6:58am.

Almost one in ten workers has been sacked or given a written warning for being late after sleeping in.

Around 1,000 adults were questioned by the company about their sleeping and waking habits.

More than 30 per cent set at least five alarms to rouse them from their slumber.

The report shows people are struggling to cope with the national average of just six hours and 36 minutes sleep per night - much less than the recommended eight hours.

A quarter of us feel like we haven't had enough sleep when we wake up.

Business development manager Tom Gladdle, 25, often hits the snooze button up to five times to bag an extra half-an-hour in bed.

Mr Gladdle, from Clapham, London, said: 'I have always struggled with getting out of bed in the morning.

The majority of Britons snooze for 14 minutes because they feel they haven't had enough time in bed

'I tend to hit the snooze button 
repeatedly and sometimes find myself pressing it up to 5 times, snoozing
 for up to half an hour.

'This
 means I have very little time to get ready for work and end up leaving 
the house, feeling rushed, stressed and not prepared for the day ahead.

'I wish I could just get straight out of bed when the alarm goes off, giving myself more time so I leave the house feeling relaxed and focused for work.'

The time spent lazing between the sheets could be put to better use, he added.

Mr Gladdle said: 'It's dawned on me that this time spent snoozing quickly adds up.

'I am actually spending a lot my life lying in bed when I could be achieving other things.

'I trained for a marathon last year and always tried to get out of bed for a morning run, but more often than not, failed.

'This meant I ended up training late in the evening when I was tired and lacking energy.

'I can't help thinking how much quicker my Marathon time could have been if I had just stopped snoozing.'
