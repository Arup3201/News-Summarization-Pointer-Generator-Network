With fashion week upon us designers are pulling out all the stops to create show-stopping pieces of work to capture the world's attention.

And as one of the most popular fashion shows on TV, Project Runway got in on the action with an eye-catching exhibition at their Project Runway Designer Reunion party in New York last night.

To mark 11 seasons of the fashion-packed show, the catwalk competition show threw a glamorous soiree complete with beautiful models painted in celebrated designers' patterns to blend into the striking wallpaper behind them.

Blending in: Beautiful models blend into the striking wallpaper- all celebrated designer's patterns on show at the Project Runway's Designer Reunion party in New York

The quirky exhibition was off the wall - and so well executed that some guests could have been forgiven for looking straight through the models as they disappeared into the funky motifs plastered on the walls of New York's Skylight West club.

The selected guests, including contestants from every series of the popular TV show were in attendance at the fashion soiree and mingled with host HP surrounded by the bizarre fashion parade.

Uncanny: Some guests could have been forgiven for looking straight through the models as they disappeared into the funky motifs plastered on the walls

Celebration: The motifs - all celebrated designer's patterns - were on show at the Project Runway's Designer Reunion party in New York to celebrate 11 seasons of the popular fashion show

Prints and patterns: Contestants from every season of the show gathered to admire the quirky artwork

Taking a tumble: Slippery floors at the Lincoln Center caused a woman to fall next to Project Runway Judge Nina Garcia after the fashion show. At least 5 people have been falling at the front entrance after every show

Bump: The unlucky reveller slipped on the marble floor as she entered the party. Sadly there are no more photos of the other unlucky few who slipped
