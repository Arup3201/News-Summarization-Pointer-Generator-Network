A 41-year-old mother-of-two who was caught on camera ransacking a Florida McDonald's wearing nothing but a thong has spoken out about her rampage, saying she does not remember anything about the incident but was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time.

Sandra Suarez is alleged to have offered a restaurant worker oral sex in the parking lot of the Pinellas Park store on March 24, with the subsequent rejection causing her to flip out, police said.

CCTV footage of her reign of destruction - including destroying a register, throwing around equipment and eating soft serve straight from the dispenser - surfaced this week after two employees posted it online.

Both have now been fired.

According to Fox 13, Suarez was arrested and immediately sent for a medical examination, with a doctor telling police she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Suarez was interviewed on Tuesday by Fox 13 under the provision she didn't have to speak on camera.

She blamed the tirade on bipolar disorder.

Suarez was charged with criminal mischief and resisting arrest, then was released on $7,000 bond.

The video has gone viral and is narrated by the now-terminated McDonald's employees, who were watching it after the fact on the store's security cameras.

'This woman is my new role model,' joked one employee.

Restaurant owner Juan Illas said 'posting of the video was without authorization and inconsistent with my values and how we operate our restaurant'.
