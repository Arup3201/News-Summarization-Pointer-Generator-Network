Booksellers could soon have a secret weapon in the war against declining trade - the smell of chocolate.

Researchers in Belgium have discovered that shoppers are more likely to take their time browsing and buy books from certain genres if a bookstore smells of chocolate.

Scientists from the Hasselt University in eastern Belgium conducted a 10 day experiment in a general interest book shop.

Sales boost: The smell of chocolate circulated around a bookstore made customers more likely to browse the store and take their time according to Belgian researchers

Sweet smell of success: The smell was circulated for around half the store's trading hours

The team dispersed a subtle smell of chocolate into the store that wasn't immediately noticeable to customers but strong enough so that it could be identified once pointed out.

The smell was present in the store for around half of the store's opening hours and researchers found that customers were more likely to take their time in the store and talk to members of staff.

The report, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, found specifically that 'customers were 2.22 times more likely to closely examine multiple books when the chocolate scent was present in store, compared with the control condition.'

Shoppers were less likely to search out a particular book and more likely to browse the shelves.

The scent also appeared to influence the genre of books customers bought.

Taking their time: Customers were more likely to browse books when the chocolate scent was emitted than searching for a particular title

More than a fifth of books sold were either food and drink and romance novels or history books and crime thrilers.

Sales in the first two categories rose by 40 per cent when the scent was dispersed, whereas sales in the second two categories increased by just over a fifth when the scent was absent.

But the smell of chocolate seemed to move customers away from the history and crime thriller section.

The report, which studied every fifth customer of the 201 who entered the store, concluded: 'Retailers can make use of pleasant ambient scents to improve the store environment, leading consumers to explore the store.'
