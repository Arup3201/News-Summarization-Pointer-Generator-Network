A mother dumped the father of one of her three children so she could claim more benefits.

Portia Clarke, 34, told him to move out of their home so she could rake in nearly £17,000 a year in handouts as an unemployed single mother.

She grew frustrated that the £13,000 salary former partner Paul Burke earned as a factory worker reduced her entitlement to welfare – and left her little money for splashing out on luxury items.

'Sponging': Aspiring glamour model Portia Clarke now spends handouts on luxury goods such as foreign holidays

The aspiring glamour model, who has 
never worked, now has her rent and council tax paid for by the state – 
and spends much of the £1,000 monthly disposable income she gets on 
nights out, clothes and five-star holidays to Turkey.

Mr
 Burke, 24, decided that living apart was not working and the couple 
split after four years together. Now their two-year-old daughter and 
Miss Clarke’s two children from previous relationships, aged 12 and 
seven, are living without the father figure they all call ‘Dad’.

Speaking
 from her three-bedroom terraced council house in Middleton, Greater 
Manchester, she told the Mail: ‘The children miss having him around but 
they’re happy because they get to see him on weekends.’

In
 an interview with Closer magazine, out this week, she said she had no 
regrets about moving Mr Burke out of their home.

‘Paul only earned £800 a
 month at the factory, and by the time we’d paid rent we didn’t have 
much left. I couldn’t buy myself nice clothes or go on holidays,’ she 
said.

Miss Clarke, whose 
home contains expensive goods including a 50-inch TV and a leather-style
 sofa, now receives a range of handouts including jobseeker’s allowance,
 income support, child benefits and tax credits.

She claims it is a better alternative to ‘flogging my guts out for low pay’ when she left beauty college at 18.

After
 falling pregnant with her first child she was given a council house and
 £600 a month in benefits, which increased by £200 for her second child.
 After meeting Mr Burke she was reluctant for him to move in as it meant
 paying council tax and rent and losing some housing benefit and income 
support. She eventually agreed when she became pregnant with his child.

The
 couple got engaged but rowed about money, with Miss Clarke saying she 
‘resented’ that her benefits had been cut because of Mr Burke’s modest 
income – even though it was enough to cover their £400 monthly 
outgoings.

‘Paul wanted me 
to get a job, but I knew I’d never find anything that paid decent 
money,’ she added. ‘I asked Paul to get a better paid job, but he 
couldn’t find anything, so I suggested he could move out and we could 
carry on the relationship, but he wasn’t having any of it.

‘It
 sounds heartless but my life is better now we’ve split and I’m back on 
full benefits. I do miss Paul and the kids are sad that we’ve broken 
up... I feel guilty but I know it’s for the best. Now I’m only going to 
date men on benefits – life’s much easier that way.’

Mr
 Burke told the magazine: ‘Portia’s very money-orientated and obsessed 
with sponging off the system. I’ve worked since I left school at 16 and I
 don’t want to live on benefits.

‘I was devastated when we split up – I just couldn’t see how we could move forward while living apart.

‘Now I’m happily single and focusing on the kids.’

A
 spokesman for the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s no surprise people 
are breaking up with their partners when there are financial incentives 
to do so. The benefits system is full of loopholes and allowances.

‘It’s clear radical reform is needed to make sure this sort of abuse doesn’t become even more widespread.’
