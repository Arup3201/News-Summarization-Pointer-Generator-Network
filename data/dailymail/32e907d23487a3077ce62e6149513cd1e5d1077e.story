A coroner has ordered police to re-investigate the death of a British student in Ibiza following a fall after her family claimed she was pushed.

Relatives of fashion undergraduate Rachel Turner, 22, insist that she did not throw herself off a 15ft high balcony.

They spent £70,000 on their own investigation which claims Miss Turner had injuries to her hands and fingers – suggesting she attempted to cling to the balcony ledge before she fell.

Private detectives also discovered text messages had been deleted from her phone before and after her death.

An inquest that started this week was brought to a halt on Wednesday after the new claims were presented to coroner Sarah Ormonde-Walsh, who asked police to contact the Spanish authorities over the death in October 2007.

Pathologist Dr David Rouse also told the Birmingham hearing the ‘excessive damage’ to Miss Turner’s fingers gave him ‘concern’.

He added: ‘It suggests that there  was struggling to prevent yourself from falling. It’s something far more sinister.’

Miss Turner’s devastated parents, Leslie – a company director – and Jane, 63, a former midwife, are convinced their ‘happy’ daughter was murdered.

Mrs Turner, from Northfield, Birmingham, said: ‘We think Rachel was pushed. Dr Rouse, the pathologist said that most of her finger nails were missing. He said that is highly suspicious.’

Outside court, Mr Turner, added: ‘I am 100 per cent certain she was killed – I’ve got no doubt.

‘When we went to the inquest the coroner was taken aback by this three-inch thick file of all the information we’d gathered.

‘In her opening remarks the coroner said, “I can clearly see you’ve been to the ends of the earth to put this before me”.’ Miss Turner, who was studying at Birmingham City University, was working as a club promoter on the Spanish island during her summer holidays when the incident happened.

She died six days after being airlifted home to the UK and Spanish authorities later concluded she had intentionally jumped from a stairwell ledge at a housing complex in San Antonio.

But Mr Turner told the hearing his daughter had been ‘happy’ and ‘chatty’ and had been organising a welcome home party for herself.

He also claimed his daughter had been plagued by a male admirer in the run-up to her death after she had spurned his romantic advances.

He said the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was ‘never arrested or seriously questioned about her death’.

The inquest heard Rachel, who was a student at Birmingham City University, had not intended to harm herself

Miss
 Turner’s boyfriend Michael Tollerfield, who worked in security in Ibiza
 but now lives in Edinburgh, sobbed yesterday as he told how he had 
tried to revive Miss Turner after she fell.

He
 claimed she was upset and spoke about ‘personal things’ when he found 
her sitting on the ledge with her feet over the side. ‘One second she 
was there and the next she wasn’t,’ he said.

West Midlands Police said it will refer the concerns raised by Miss Turner’s family to the Spanish authorities.
