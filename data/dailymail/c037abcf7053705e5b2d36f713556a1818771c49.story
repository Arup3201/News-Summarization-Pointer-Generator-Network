Sunning herself on a Miami beach and laughing with friends in the sea, Nicole Minetti appears to have forgotten that she is facing five years behind bars.

The Anglo-Italian showgirl was sentenced in July for procuring and grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties.

But she seemed to have left the weight of the world behind her when she was pictured enjoying a break in the Florida coastal city over Christmas.

What conviction? Nicole Minetti enjoys the sun on a Miami beach over Christmas while awaiting an appeal over her five-year prison sentence for procuring prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties

Fun in the sun: Minetti (left) frolics in the sea with a friend. The 28-year-old acted as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-Italian premier's sex parties, a court in Milan ruled

A court in Milan ruled that the 28-year-old, whose mother is British, acted as a Madam running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier’s sex parties.

However, she has been allowed to walk free while she appeals the decision.

Minetti, a regional councillor for Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes and expensive gifts after the dinners at the prime minister’s luxury villa near Milan.

Prosecutor Pietro Forno had told the court that Minetti acted as 'the brothel manager, paying salaries and choosing locations'.

Guilty: In a separate but related trial, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, who was then just 17 years old

Files included a telephone tap transcript in which a former police officer told a friend sordid details about the bawdy parties.

He said: 'Minetti was there with her chest out kissing Berlusconi continuously. It was a real whorehouse. All the girls were given rings and necklaces.'

Among the young girls recruited for the erotic parties was Ruby, a then 17-year-old Moroccan-born exotic dancer whose real name is Karima El-Mahroug.

Berlusconi was sentenced in a previous
 trial to seven years in jail for paying for sex with Ruby and abusing 
his prime ministerial powers to favour her.

Showbusiness
 agent Lele Mora and television host Emilio Fede were also sentenced to 
seven years each for procuring Ruby and other call girls, while former 
dental hygienist Nicole Minetti was given five years.

All three, like Berlusconi, have denied the charges and are not behind bars because they are appealing the verdicts.
