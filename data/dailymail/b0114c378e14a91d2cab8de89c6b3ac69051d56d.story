Fearless Joachim Low says Germany do not fear Leo Messi and Argentina because they have a generation of players who can make World Cup history and stay on top of the world game for years to come.

Low, who leads Germany into their first World Cup final since 2002, where they can become the first European side ever to lift the trophy in South America, is confident the restructuring of German football over the past ten years will build to a victorious climax at the Maracana.

‘We don’t have any fear whatsoever,’ said Low. ‘We have the necessary level of self-confidence and the respect for our opponents’ strength, but we are convinced if we impose our game, we will win.

‘We can write history. In the past, 
Latin Americans have dominated in South America all the time. This would
 be considered an additional joy for us if we were to win as Europeans 
on Latin American soil.’

The
 German FA restructured its administration and coaching after failures 
at Euro 2000 and 2004, with Low joining the coaching staff ten years 
ago.

He suffered World Cup semi-final defeat in 2006, as assistant, and in 2010.

But the ruthless way in which Germany ripped Brazil apart in the semi-finals sent shockwaves through world football.

Toni
 Kroos, Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira were all 
outstanding - as was 23-year-old Andre Schurrle, who came off the bench 
to score a fine brace.

If the Germans win again to lift the World Cup on Sunday, Low is convinced it will not be the last time his players do so.

With
 an average age of 26, this Germany squad is the sixth youngest in 
Brazil. And two of their rising stars - Ilkay Gundogan and Marco Reus - 
are both missing through injury.

Low thinks the potential is there for 
Germany to dominate world football - just as Spain did when they won 
three successive major trophies, starting with Euro 2008.

‘We have players at 
their peak, but we also have young players in the squad and others who 
aren’t even here, players with a fantastic future,’ said Low.

‘Ilkay
 Gundogan, Marco Reus, Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle, Thomas Muller can go 
on to play on top of the world for a good few years yet, with young 
players coming in to reinforce the team.’

Low
 has warned his team not to obsess about the threat of Messi, though 
many observers see the game as a chance to elevate the Barcelona 
superstar to the level of the legendary Pele and Diego Maradona if he 
wins the World Cup.

Low, whose side beat Argentina 4-0 in the quarter-final four years ago, said: ‘This team is not only about Messi.

'If
 you believed it was, you’d be making a mistake. They have Angel Di 
Maria, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain. Their team is better organised 
than in 2010 as they’ve shown over the tournament.

After
 their 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the semi-final, Germany are big 
favourites to beat Argentina and win the World Cup in Rio.

If
they are successful, it will be fourth time they have won the famous
 trophy - but it will be the only occasion they have triumphed on South 
American soil.

Indeed, no European nation has won the tournament on this continent in four attempts.

Czechoslovakia
 and Holland reached the final in 1962 and 1978 respectively, but Low 
hopes his team can go one better in Brazil this weekend.

Ever since Germany hammered Portugal 4-0 in the group stages, they seemed destined to make Sunday's final.

Their
 only scare came in the second round when they needed extra-time to beat
 Algeria, one of the surprise packages of the tournament.

Low's optimism is also born out of the fact that he has done everything possible to get his team ready for Sunday's game - both physically and mentally.

The Germany coach and his backroom staff scoured the planet on scouting missions well before the tournament began and they have been working on a plan to defeat the Argentinians ever since they swept Brazil aside in Belo Horizonte.

'Over the last few years we've travelled
 and watched international football, in Europe and South America, and 
we've tried to learn little things that can influence matches,' Low 
said.

'We've taken on the new-fangled things that are being done. We have looked at Spain and we've looked across the border at what the Dutch are doing - how they train individual players.'

That planning extends to penalty preparation too.

Manuel Neuer has been tirelessly studying Argentina's penalty takers so he is primed and ready should they match go beyond extra-time.

Germany have one of the best penalty records in history, but Low hopes his team win in normal time.

'We hope and expect to decide the match before,' he said. 'Penalty shoot-outs depend on so many things.

'They're an additional pressure. But all the goalkeepers are ready for that potential. We have tried to analyse the situation.'

Germany and Argentina share a rich history when it comes to World Cups. Germany defeated the South American nation to win Italia '90 and four years earlier Diego Maradona captained the Argentinians to World Cup glory after a 3-2 final win over West Germany.

'It will be a gripping final between two teams who have had fascinating duels in the past,' said Low.
