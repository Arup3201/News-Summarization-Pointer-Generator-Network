A misplaced mouse-click has been blamed for more than 200 patients temporarily 'killed off' after a major metropolitan hospital accidentally issued death notices to their family doctors.

The Austin Health hospital in Heidelberg, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, mistakenly sent out a fax to more than 200 patients saying they had died.

Fortunately, the mistake was realised within hours, and Austin Health contacted each GP to alert them to the mistake and to apologise.

It's believed GPs were alerted to the error before they had a chance to contact families, but in one case a doctor did call a family member to express their condolences.

Austin health sent this letter to GPs stating their patients had died whilst an inpatient at the hospital. The health service has since apologised for the mistake

The blunder was put down to human error and came when a computer file was saved to the wrong location, substituting the death notice for the standard patient discharge form.

Austin Heath communications director Taryn Sheehy said, 'Austin Health automatically notifies GPs when their patients are discharged from hospital.

'Notifications sent in the early hours of Wednesday, 30th July, incorrectly advised GPs that their patients, who had been discharged the previous day from the Austin Hospital, had died.'

Ms Sheehy said 'we apologise unreservedly to affected clinics who, for the most part, were very understanding about the error.'

The mix-up was not linked to the hospital's recent introduction of a new booking system, she said, and at no times did it impact on patient care

A number of GPs in Victoria have accidentally been sent death notices of their patients by Austin Health which has been blamed on human error

Dr. Tony Bartone, president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, said the major blunder was just unacceptable.

'IT issues must not undermine patient care or trust in the Victorian healthcare system. Many of these GPs have long relationships with these patients and their families. It would have been distressing to receive such a fax, especially relating to the unexpected death of children and teenagers. It is unacceptable for failings like this to happen.'

'This serves to underline the importance of a strong and robust, state-wide IT health system. Victorians are still being denied this necessary resource.'

The Victorian Labor Opposition has also weighed in and says the incident is a further sign of a hospital system in crisis.

'They obviously can't take that back, it's symptomatic of a health system that is in crisis, a health system where emergency departments are full,' said Labor leader Daniel Andrews in Melbourne.

'You talk to any nurses, any doctor, any paramedic, any patient or their loved ones, and they'll tell you that we shouldn't settle for the health system the way it is now.'
