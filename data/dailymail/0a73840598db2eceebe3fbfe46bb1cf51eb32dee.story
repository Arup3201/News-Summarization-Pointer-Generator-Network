Arrested: Lauri Love, from Suffolk, is alleged to have stolen 'massive amounts' of confidential information, including details of military servicemen, by breaking into thousands of computers

The British son of a Baptist minister has been arrested and charged with hacking into the computer networks of the US military and Nasa, causing millions of dollars of damage.

Lauri Love, an activist in the Occupy movement, is alleged to have stolen ‘massive amounts’ of confidential information – including details of military servicemen – by breaking into thousands of computers.

The 28-year-old from Stradishall, Suffolk, is said to have bragged in messages with his co-conspirators: ‘You have no idea how much we can f*** with the US government if we wanted to’.

Neighbours of his family spoke of their shock at seeing him arrested in the quiet, rural community.

Love was described as a ‘sophisticated 
and prolific’ hacker in court documents filed in New Jersey, where he is
 charged with one count of accessing a US department or agency computer 
without permission and another charge of conspiracy.

He was arrested 
on Friday at his parents’ semi-detached home in Suffolk, from where he 
is thought to have hacked the computers.

The operation was carried out by the National Crime Agency, the new elite force known as 'Britain's FBI'.

Love could be extradited to the
 US, where if convicted he faces up to ten years in prison and a fine 
for twice the damage caused.

The US government said Love worked with 
two other people in Australia and one in Sweden – who have not been 
charged – ‘to disrupt the operations and infrastructure’ of the federal 
government.

From October 2012 until July this year it is claimed he 
hacked into thousands of government computer systems – including those 
of the US Army, US Missile Defense Agency and Nasa – and left behind 
‘back doors’ through which he could return to get sensitive data.

The
 hacking ‘substantially impaired the functioning of dozens of computer 
servers’ and caused ‘millions of dollars in damage’ to government 
agencies, according to the indictment.

It includes pieces of instant 
message conversations Love allegedly had with his partners as the hacks 
took place. In one from July [2013], he seems to brag about infiltrating
 Nasa networks. He allegedly wrote: ‘lol Nasa. Ahaha, we owning lots of 
Nasa sites … I think we can do some hilarious stuff with it.’

In 
another post, he wrote: ‘This stuff is really sensitive. It’s basically 
every piece of information you’d need to do full identity theft on any 
employee or contractor for the [government agency].’ It is claimed that 
Love, who used the online pseudonyms ‘nsh’, ‘route’, ‘peace’, ‘shift’ 
and ‘love’, planned to use social media, including Twitter, to publicise
 the attacks.

In one message he planned to announce an attack ‘so it 
rolls along the morning news in US and gets Europe for the afternoon and
 evening.’

Last night, at his parents’ home, Love said after being 
released on bail: ‘I can’t say anything right now. I only just got home 
after being at government headquarters today.

‘My dad is ill and my 
parents both work at the prison so it wouldn’t be fair on them to talk 
about what’s going on with all this just at this moment.’

Love’s 
father Alexander Love, 60, a Baptist minister, works as a chaplain at 
HMP Highpoint North. His mother Sirkka-Liisa Love, 59, also works at the
 category C prison as a teacher. Last night neighbours in the small 
Suffolk village told of their shock at the allegations.

Student Kayleigh Streeton, 18, said: 'My brother came home and saw police cars park up outside and they were taking computers away.

'We knew there was something going on but it wasn't until we heard it on the news that we realised what he was accused of.

'You didn't see him around the estate much and, when you do see him out, he mostly keeps to himself. His parents are friendly with their neighbours and they seem like nice people.'

Another resident said: 'We didn't have any suspicions and to think something like that might have happened under our noses is certainly a surprise.'

Love’s father, who is Scottish, was previously 
minister at the London Road Baptist Church in Lowestoft. A worshipper 
there said: ‘Alexander was a very respected minister in the town.’

Love
 was a leader in protests at Glasgow University, where he was a student. He helped organise demonstrations including a 
sit-in as part of a protest against cuts to higher education.

He is also believed to have been a high-profile figure in the Scottish Occupy movement, part of the protests which swept throughout much of the world in 2011, and has been pictured at Occupy marches.

Love, who is believed to have studied physics, maths and computing, was apparently involved in 2011's 'Hetherington House Occupation', in which dozens of protesters took over an unused university building in Glasgow and stayed there for seven months.

The 
charges against Love were filed at the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, because he  allegedly used a server in the state as part of his activities. He 
also faces charges in Virginia for other alleged intrusions.

The 
National Crime Agency said Love had been arrested under the 
Computer Misuse Act and had been released on bail until February.

Daniel
 Andrews, director of the US Army’s computer crime investigative unit, 
said: ‘Computer intrusions present significant risks to national 
security and our military operations.’

In the past, convicted hackers and leakers have faced stiff penalties in the U.S. - former soldier Bradley Manning, now known as Chelsea, was this year sentenced to 35 years in prison for passing official secrets to WikiLeaks.

Gary McKinnon was not extradited to the United States to face hacking charges

Lauri Love's indictment for allegedly hacking into U.S. government computers has raised parallels to the case of Gary McKinnon, who fought a 10-year battle to avoid being extradited to America.

Mr McKinnon, from Wood Green, North London, was first arrested in 2002 after U.S. authorities told the police that he had hacked into military computer systems, deleting key files and leaving a message saying: 'Your security is c***.'

The American government insisted that the 47-year-old was a grave threat to national security - but Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, said that he was searching for proof that the authorities had covered up the existence of aliens.

In 2005, Mr McKinnon was placed on bail following the signing of a controversial new treaty which allows the U.S. to request the extradition of suspects from Britain without having to provide solid evidence of their guilt.

He would have faced up to 70 years in prison if convicted of hacking - and said he feared he could be sent to the terrorist prison camp in Guantanamo Bay.

Medical experts said that he would be very likely to kill himself if confined to an American prison.

Mr McKinnon fought a decade-long legal battle, backed by supporters including the Daily Mail, but was defeated in the House of Lords, the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights.

However, in October last year Home Secretary Theresa May blocked his extradition on the grounds that it would be 'incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights' due to the high suicide risk.

Two months later, he learned that he would not stand trial in Britain either.

Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that the chances of a successful conviction were 'not high' and that it was therefore not in the public interest to pursue Mr McKinnon further.
