Queens Park Rangers will revive interest in Kolbeinn Sigthorsson as they look to replace Loic Remy.

The Iceland international, 24, held talks with QPR earlier this month but Rangers were unable to match the player's terms despite the clubs agreeing a £5million fee.

Manager Harry Redknapp is also interested in Tottenham wingers Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend although the White Hart Lane club are reluctant to sell the latter.

QPR have agreed a contract with Lassana Diarra after he passed a medical on Saturday.

The former Portsmouth and Chelsea midfielder was sacked by Lokomotiv Moscow after a dispute with the coach which led to him refusing to train.

But Redknapp has moved swiftly to bring in a player he has coached in the past.
