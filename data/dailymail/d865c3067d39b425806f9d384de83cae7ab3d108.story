From Sophie Wessex and Princess Eugenie to the Duchess of Cambridge, milliner Jane Taylor, the brains behind the Jane Taylor label, boasts some impressively grand names among her army of devoted fans.

Now Ms Taylor, who has been designing bespoke and ready-to-wear hats since 2008, has been named the hat partner of choice for this year's Royal Ascot.

So what does take to get past the Ascot fashion police and straight onto the best-dressed list?  FEMAIL asked Taylor for her top tips - here's what she said:

Hats you win: Elaborate hats of varying levels of wackiness are an essential part of the Royal Ascot experience

THE BASICS

'The perfect hat should be flattering for the wearer and confidence boosting,' explains Taylor. 'Finding the right one totally depends on the person wearing it.'

For Taylor, that means taking your face shape and complexion into account when hunting for the perfect Ascot accessory.

'You should always complement your face with the shape of a hat,' insists Taylor. 'For example, if your face is round, wear an angular hat that cuts across your face.

'Or if your face is more angular, soften it was a rounded hat and a soft trim.  If you’re wearing a cocktail hat, wear it pointed down so it nearly touches your eyebrow.'

Pretty: The £795 Alyssa cocktail hat is perfect for weddings

Stylish: The £475 Snowdrop cocktail hat comes in bold cobalt

Elaborate: The Elodie, £755, comes in fashionable coral pink

GO BOLD

With the perennially popular fascinator banned by Ascot's fashion police this time around, Taylor says it's time to consider swapping it for something a little more exciting.

Along with wide-brimmed hats, options include berets, perchers or Sophie Wessex' favourite small disc shaped hats.

'I would suggest a small cocktail hat,' adds Taylor. 'There are plenty of different shapes to choose from if you'd rather avoid a large brims.'

CHOOSE QUALITY

With designer hats costing more than many Ascot-goers can afford, finding a quality hat on the high street can be a challenge.

There is, however, a simple solution. 'I absolutely love coming across vintage 
millinery,' explains Taylor. 'They are finely made and the quality and 
finished effect is really outstanding.'

Along with costing less than a designer number, vintage hats are also unique which means you won't have to worry about doubling up with another guest.

TRY OUT A NEW TREND

While not everyone wants to risk ridicule by being spotted out and about in a flamboyant piece of millinery, there's no reason not to try something new.

'Big brims and stylised boater hats are huge news for this summer,' explains Taylor. 
'Small tailored cocktail hats, pastels and coral are also a good choice, while aqua and nude are going to be as popular as ever this year.'

Fun: While human hats require some thought, for canine Ascot goers such as Zoe (above), anything goes

Quirky: Ascot is famous for its unusual hats such as this tiered cake design

Bright stuff: Colourful coral hats such as this one are set to be popular this year

Personality: According to Taylor, letting your personality shine through is good

Make sure the new hat works with your complexion but don't be afraid to let your personality shine through.

'People choose hats to show off their 
personality,' adds Taylor, 'and I always admire the people who choose more elaborate 
pieces as they have the confidence to pull them off.'

LOOK TO THE ROYALS FOR INSPIRATION

The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex always look impeccably turned out, and that, says Taylor, is because they've nailed the perfect styling formula.

'The perfect Ascot outfit is a simple tailored dress in a classic shape, worn with a exquisite elaborate hat,' explains Taylor, who says the Countess of Wessex is a favourite client.

'I have designed for the Countess of Wessex for many years and she is always a pleasure to work with,' adds Taylor. But it's always lovely to see my pieces worn by the Royal Family.'

Jane Taylor will be among the leading milliners appearing at Fenwick's emergency hat clinics starting on June 10th. For more information, see fenwick.co.uk.

Royal Ascot starts on 17th June and runs until the 21st. See ascot.co.uk for more information and tickets.
