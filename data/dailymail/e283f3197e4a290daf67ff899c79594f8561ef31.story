Tim Blackwood has been jailed for 10 months after he punched a patient with severe learning disabilities and threatened to 'knock him out' at the Newcastle-under-Lyme care home he worked in

A carer punched a patient with severe learning difficulties in the ribs and threatened to knock him out after he threw a clipboard across the room. 

Staff at Ashley House Hospital in Newcastle-under-Lyme had to hold back Tim Blackwood after he launched the unprovoked attack on the patient and started swearing at him. 

The patient had been leaving the room with another member of staff when the pair argued and as he went through the door Blackwood lunged at him and punched him. 

He was jailed for 10 months after Judge David Fletcher said the attack took place when he was 'in charge of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.' 

Blackwood initially said he had punched the man because he felt threatened but later conceded that he had behaved 'inappropriately' in the heat of the moment.  

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard he had also failed to declare two cautions in order to get the job at the care home, run by the Huntercombe group. 

He had been working at the home for eight weeks when the incident took place. 

The court heard Blackwood lashed out in September 2013 after a patient threw a clipboard across the lounge.

Blackwood responded with the 'knock you out' threat, before swearing and punching the man in the ribs.

Nurse Abigail Haynes said: 'Tim was swearing a lot and the pair continued to be verbally aggressive to each other.

'I told the patient to come to the relaxation room with me to calm down and he agreed.

'As he was walking through the door, Tim lunged forward and punched him on the back of the ribs. I saw it clearly.

'The patient seemed really shocked. When we checked his body, he had red marks.'

Support worker Matt Hope added: 'Verbal arguments happen quite often. It's part of what we have to deal with on a daily basis.

'When Tim punched the patient I was shocked. He was not being threatening at all. 

Ashley House Hospital in Staffordshire is a low secure hospital for men and women with learning difficulties

'We are trained to de-escalate situations by using low-level calming methods.'

Paul Cliff, defending, admitted that staff are not meant to react to provocation. 

He added: 'He's a man who has suffered from stress and depression and was never cut out for this kind of work.

'The defendant has spent a lifetime in work and is now the principal carer for his 87-year-old mother.'

At the hearing Blackwood pleaded guilty to fraud and mistreating a patient. 

He was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for ill-treating a patient and six months imprisonment for fraud, to run concurrently. 

The Huntercombe Group said Mr Blackwood was suspended immediately and has now been dismissed.

A spokesman said: 'The well-being of patients is our priority and we have a whistle-blowing policy that encourages staff to raise any concerns they may have about any aspect of care.'

Ashley House Hospital is a low secure hospital near to Market Drayton and provides care for adult men and women.
