Accused: William MacKenzie, who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey, outside Shrewsbury Magistrates Court

A pensioner who kept owls and hawks was filmed by neighbours kicking and punching the birds of prey in his back garden, a court heard.

William MacKenzie, 68, is also accused of threatening the birds - including three owls and a hawk - with a petrol-powered lawnmower.

MacKenzie denied 10 animal welfare charges when he appeared at Shrewsbury Magistrates Court on Tuesday.

The court heard neighbours filmed him brutally attacking the birds of prey in the back garden of his home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, last June.

Shocking footage appeared to show bearded MacKenzie striking and kicking several birds of prey, including a snowy owl and an African spotted eagle owl.

MacKenzie, who has 30 years of experience handling birds of prey, claimed he cared for the birds which had been abandoned or injured by cars.

He said: 'These owls were like my family.

'They were like my children and it was very difficult when these birds were taken from me.

'I would never punch or kick these birds, I would rather punch or kick a human being to any animal.'

But prosecution witness Neil Forbes, a veterinary surgeon and expert in avian medicine, said he had never seen a falconer behave in this manner to birds of prey.

He told the court: 'In my opinion they are not just suffering physically but also suffering distress and anxiety.

'I don’t not see any justification for treating a bird in this way.

'This is physical aggression and damage to the bird and I can see no place in modern day training or handling for this sort of behaviour.'

The court also saw footage of MacKenzie using a petrol-powered lawnmower to cut the grass just inches from where several owls and a Harris hawk were perched.

The footage appeared to show the birds trying to fly away in distress.

Trial: Shrewsbury Magistrates Court, where the hearing was held on Tuesday

Mr Forbes added: 'Both barn owls are flying away from the noise and the proximity of the lawnmower.

'It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the birds are worried, surely you would put them away. I’m not sure if it’s sheer laziness of total lack of care.'

But MacKenzie argued other noises had not frightened the birds, whom he claimed were used to the sound of the lawnmower.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
