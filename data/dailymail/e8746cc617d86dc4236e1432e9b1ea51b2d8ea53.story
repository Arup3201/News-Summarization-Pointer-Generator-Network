Australian terrorist Mohamed Elomar has posted a chilling tweet wishing the Sydney siege victims 'rot in hell' just a day after they died.

An image of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson was posted after the siege ended along with the caption: 'Did someone say ''Rot in Hell'' yes indeed rot hell for eternity.'

It was tweeted from a Twitter account thought to belong to western Sydney jihadist Mohamed Elomar.

This comes as a photo of a child described as 'Abu Omar al australi young cub of the Islamic State' was posted this week.

The new picture surfaced of a 'cub jihadist' believed to be the son of notorious militant Khaled Sharrouf - as Australian jihadists celebrate a reunion in the Middle East.

Sharrouf fled to the Middle East last year and was shortly followed by his wife, Tara Nettleton, and their three children.

'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifa', the account captioned this image of Melbourne men Mahmoud Abdullatif and Abu Jihad

In another image posted Elomar, Melbourne men Mahmoud Abdullatif and Abu Jihad are pictured, apparently joining forces with the western Sydney men in fighting for the Islamic State.

'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifa,' the picture is captioned. Jihad is pictured wielding a high-powered, silver rifle. 

Abdullatif, who was a purveyor of fast cars and a keen reveller at Melbourne nightclubs just months ago, is pictured heavily bearded and wearing military fatigues.

Sharrouf and Elomar first rose to infamy after they posted pictures of themselves, and one of Sharrouf's sons, dangling decapitated heads in the Syrian city of Raqqa last year.

Monash University terror expert Greg Barton told Daily Mail Australia the jihadists were trying to convey a particular propaganda message.

'I think Islamic State's quite happy to convey the picture that everyone's having a jolly good time and that it's a manly thing to do.

'Fathers can let their youngest sons join them in the fighting. But Islamic State wants to let this vibe go out to help their recruitment.' 

Elomar had recently advertised selling Yazidi slave girls on one of his social media accounts. 'Anyone interested got 1 of 7 yehzidi for sale,' he said. 'She won't disappoint you'.

Prof Barton said: 'They're also pushing this idea of young men not married going over and finding some attractive and submissive young wife. It's silly stuff. 

'I think it's feeding this fantasy that everything is positive.'

Last month, the Sydney siege claimed the lives of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson.

A vile tweet was posted about the two victims on December 17, saying: 'Did someone say ''Rot in Hell'' yes indeed rot hell for eternity.'

However their deaths shook the whole city as thousands paid tribute by leaving flowers nearby the Lindt cafe in Martin Place - where the crisis took place.
