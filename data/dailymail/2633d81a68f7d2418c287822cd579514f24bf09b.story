A grieving widow has spoken of the devastating moment she realised her husband had been killed in a cycling accident and airlifted to the hospital where she was working.

Sharon Buckley was on duty as a healthcare assistant at Royal Preston hospital when colleagues asked her to identify the body of a cyclist they suspected to be her husband.

Shocked and hysterical, the 48-year-old mother-of-four didn't want to believe he could be dead. 'It felt like a bad dream,' she said.

Mark Buckley, 51, had been airlifted to the Royal Preston hospital after suffering massive head injuries when his bicylce was involved in a fatal crash in Trough of Bowland, Lancashire.

The keen sportsman was pronounced dead shortly after being taken in to A&E, leaving colleagues to break the news to Mrs Buckley.

'I was at work when the Sister came to get me and she put her hand on my hand,' said the 48-year-old mother of four.

'I instantly started thinking: "What’s wrong?" and my heart was thudding as I followed them to another room.'

Feeling nervous and fearful, she was then asked if her husband had been riding his bike and whether he had worn cycling gear.

'They then gently told me that someone had been killed and that they thought it was Mark and could I come and identify him.

'I was absolutely hysterical when they told me. I just kept saying: "I can’t believe it".

'You find yourself going into such a state of shock that it does not hit home at all. It is like a bad dream.'

Mrs Buckley said that after a while the sense of dread at hearing an air ambulance at work begins to diminish and the implications of what it means do not normally sink in.

But this time she was faced with the agonising task of telling her four daughters that their father was dead.

'Mark absolutely adored his girls. They were his whole life. He was such a hands on dad and did so many things sports wise with them.

'Telling them their fit and healthy dad had suddenly died was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.'

An inquest is to be held later this month into how Mr Buckley was killed last September.

His death came after years of heartache for the family who saw their second daughter, Katie, battle leukaemia for years from the age of 16. She relapsed after a round of intensive chemotherapy and only recovered after her younger sister Ginny, 11, donated her bone marrow.

'The girls feel really sad about losing their dad but we are all plodding on," said Mrs Buckley.

'Ginny is like a little lost soul without her dad. He was the only male in a female household and there is a gaping hole now he has gone.

'Mark was a very strong character and he always looked after the girls. It was such a shock to suddenly lose Mark - especially after everything we had been through with Katie’s illness.

'His death was so hard to accept as it came completely out of the blue.'

She said that her husband was such a proficient cyclist that I never worried about him being out on his bike.”

Prisoners at Garth Prison where Mr Buckley was a PE Officer are building a bench in his memory which will be put up at Dunsop Bridge near where he died.
