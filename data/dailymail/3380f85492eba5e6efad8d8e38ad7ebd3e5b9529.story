A mysterious San Antonio 'priest' is offering to absolve sins digitally - by taking confessions using Snapchat.

However, the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy, who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app, which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them.

Despite @priestDavid claiming he wants to make confession easier, others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger, who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest.

Available to hear your confession: Christian priests in San Antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @priestDavid

'It's not confession. It's not what the sacrament is all about,' said local San Antonio priest, the Reverend Tony Vilano to News 4 in San Antonio.

'He's not a Catholic priest. The church teaches when you go to confession, you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face.'

While it is not known what Christian denomination @priestDavid is, he claims the Snapchat confession is part of a college student's project he is helping with.

He also told News 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23-years.

The confessions will be heard for two weeks from March 2 to March 16.

Unethical: Confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face-to-face

Traditional: This is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years

'Doing it Snapchat, I mean, you can do Snapchat or through the internet and list everything you've done and there's no humility in there. There's no ownership of the sins you've committed,' said Rev. Vilano to News 4.

Others are more damning of @priestDavid. Archdiocese of San Antonio Deacon Pat Rodgers vehemntly disagrees with using Snapchat for confessions.

He said that in fact the man, if he is a priest, has gone rogue and that confessions must take place face-to-face.

News 4 in San Antonio took to the street to ask the public their opinions.

'Ridiculous. Absurd. That's what the Catholic church is for. Internet is not reality. You want confession, go see a priest,' said Richard de Leon III to News 4.

In a statement, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas said: 'The Episcopal Diocese of West Texas recognizes there are various ways churches can reach out to people through social media. However, Episcopalians are not asked to present private confessions to a priest, instead confession is offered in worship, as part of the church's liturgy.'
