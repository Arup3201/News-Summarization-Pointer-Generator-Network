In the run-up to Christmas, one pet store owner in New Hampshire was horrified to find 13 dogs worth more than $5,000 had been snatched Tuesday morning.

But thanks to swift action from police, the puppies from Bill's Pet and Aquarium in Manchester were recovered unscathed.

An officer attending the scene spotted a teenager suspiciously carrying a puppy and after a foot chase ensued, four individuals aged 17 to 18 were arrested on the spot. 

Recovered: 13 puppies were found Tuesday morning after they were reported stolen from Bill's Pet and Aquarium in Manchester, New Hampshire 

In safe hands: The pooches were apparently stolen around 6:30am by four teenage suspects 

The animals were apparently stolen around 6:30am.

A passerby noticed a glass door at the pet store had been smashed open and called authorities.

The suspects were still lurking when police arrived and  the puppies were located at a home nearby.

The pooches included chocolate Labrador Retrievers, two Cockapoos, a Shar Pei, Papillon, a Yorkie and a Cocker Spaniel.

An animal control officer says a microchip scan matched paperwork provided.

Something's up: A passerby notices that they front door of Bill's Pet and Aquarium had been smashed down

Vulnerable: Apparently the business has had break-ins before, with the dogs being valuable commodities 

The store owner told WMUR TV he's had puppies stolen before, with the intent to sell online.

By 9am the dogs were back in their enclosures. 

Despite the ordeal, they appeared to be fine.

The four culprits have been charged with receiving stolen property and other counts.
