Nicola Woolley lost 11st following gastric bypass surgery. But she was left with unsightly folds of excess skin around her tummy and waist

A morbidly obese grandmother who shed 11 stone has been awarded a six-figure settlement after botched surgery to remove unsightly folds of excess skin left her in agonising pain.

Nicola Woolley was warned she would not live to see her grandchildren grow up, after ballooning to 26st.

The 45-year-old was delighted to drop eight dress sizes.

But following her gastric bypass, the community care worker was left with mounds of sagging skin around her abdomen and waist.

The NHS agreed to a further operation to remove the excess skin.

But Mrs Woolley's delight soon turned to despair, when surgeons removed too much skin causing an infection to ravage her body leaving her in constant pain.

The grandmother-of-four, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, said: 'I decided to start losing weight as I knew that my health was starting to suffer and it was important to me to see my grandchildren grow up.

'I underwent the surgery on the advice of my doctor and was living a healthy lifestyle.

'But when you lose a lot of weight you end up with a lot of excess skin, so I was put forward for an operation to remove it.

'I was told the procedure was simple and never imagined anything could go wrong - never mind be left in constant agony with horrific scars.

'My main motivation throughout this whole ordeal was the thought of being able to play with my grandchildren.

'But I'm now in a situation which is even worse than before. It’s a living nightmare.

'I feel embarrassed by my body, I look horrendous and the scarring is beyond what I could have imagined in my worst nightmares.

'However the worst part is the pain. I can’t stand or sit down without extreme pain so playing with my 
grandchildren is impossible.

'Doctors
 have told me there is nothing they can do to help me so I am going to 
have to suffer with this for the rest of my life. I’m devastated.'

Mrs Woolley has since received a six-figure pay out from Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust.

She was admitted to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in August 2007 for a gastric bypass operation, having reached 26st.

It was a success, allowing the community care worker to shed 15st.

But in January 2009, plagued by the unsightly skin left in the wake of the weight-loss surgery, doctors advised Mrs Woolley she would need a lower body lift and tummy tuck.

She went into the operating theatre on August 18, 2009.

Following surgery to remove the excess skin, Mrs Woolley suffered an infection which caused severe blisters and chronic agonising pain

But after waking up and findings severe blisters and deeply bruised
 skin on her behind, she was immediately concerned.

Days
 after the procedure, she began to feel worse and was diagnosed with 
epidermolysis - a skin condition which results in serious blistering of 
the skin.

Despite her 
condition failing to improve, she was discharged ten days later, only to be readmitted the next day after her wounds began to ooze and 
her temperature soared.

Mrs Woolley was taken into surgery and underwent two operations to remove ‘undermined areas’ from the first procedure - consisting of two huge sections of dead tissue from her buttocks.

But this failed to solve 
the problem - leading to a further nine operations including multiple skin
 grafts, fluid drainage and tummy tucks.

Twelve operations later and Mrs Woolley 
said she is still suffering agonising pain in her buttocks and lower 
back, causing her difficulty standing or sitting.

She said: 'I thought I was doing the right thing by losing the weight as I wanted to be healthier so I could play with my grandchildren.

'But now I am in a much worse situation than before.

'The doctors had scheduled in future operations for the removal of excess skin on my arms and thighs, but I just can’t have any more surgery as I am worried about the consequences.'

Mrs Woolley instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch legal action against Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust.

She said: 'My life has been turned upside down since the operation. There are so many things I used to take for granted that I simply can’t do anymore.

'The settlement will allow me to make alterations to my house and prepare for a future with the horrendous injuries I will now have to live with for the rest of my life.'

Iona Meeres-Young, clinical negligence lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'Nicola will be in lifelong pain.

'This compensation will allow her to fund a comprehensive and coordinated program of pain management and psychological support.  

'She will also be able to implement a care regime and adapt her home to regain her independence. 

'Nicola has been imprisoned by her debilitating pain and is unlikely to work again, but this result goes some way to restore her quality of life.'

A spokeswoman for Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust told MailOnline: 'We are sorry that Mrs Woolley experienced difficulties with the recognised complications of surgery, which she underwent in 2009.

'We investigated the matter thoroughly and, whilst we have not admitted liability, we are pleased to have reached a mutually agreed settlement. We wish Mrs Woolley all the best for the future.'
