Michael McIntyre took home a cool £9¿million from his latest stand-up tour

Michael McIntyre has cashed  in a £9 million cheque from his latest stand-up comedy tour.

The comedian turned BBC1 chat show host, left, pocketed the money for his 73-date Showtime tour, which included ten nights at London’s O2 Arena in 2012.

The tour grossed £21 million, putting him on a par with the Rolling Stones or Aerosmith.

Now it has been revealed that he 
last year paid himself and his wife Kitty the £9.23million that was left
 after covering costs and taxes when he wound up the company set up for 
the tour, Buddywaldo.

Showtime
 made McIntyre, 38, one of the highest-grossing comics in the world, and
 last year he paid £2.5 million for a six-bedroom house in the Wiltshire
 countryside.

It is a far cry from his plight a decade ago, when he was £40,000 in debt and struggling on the stand-up circuit.

The
 BBC paid McIntyre about £500,000 to present his six-part chat show, 
which tomorrow features an interview with Nigella Lawson.

The
 show has had a mixed response from critics, with 400,000 viewers 
deserting it in the second week in which the guests were Abbey Clancy, 
Jeremy Clarkson and Sir David Jason.

He
 was also reportedly paid £2 million in advance for his autobiography, 
‘Life and Laughing: My Story’ and has sold over three million DVDs in 
the UK.

Last year he splashed out £2.5million on a six-bedroom mansion in the Wiltshire countryside.

The property is home to the couple and their two young sons Lucas and Oscar and boasts a tennis court and outdoor swimming pool.

He has previously spoken of how he was £40,000 in debt and living in rented accommodation just 10 years ago.

His brand of friendly, inoffensive humour has attracted fierce criticism, even among his own peers.

Vic Reeves has previously described him as being ‘far too easy and soft’, saying, ‘the same people who think Jedward are funny will go and see Michael McIntyre’.
