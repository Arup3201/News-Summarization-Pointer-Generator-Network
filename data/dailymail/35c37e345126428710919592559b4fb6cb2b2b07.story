Carlo Ancelotti is yet to know what it feels like to be knocked out of a cup competition as Real Madrid manager. Tonight, he might experience it for the first time.

The winners of last season's Copa del Rey – who also won the Champions League – are staring down the barrel of a last-16 elimination at 2-0 from the first leg against an Atletico Madrid side who have already beaten them in three different competitions this season.

Cristiano Ronaldo will parade his Ballon d'Or before the game while James Rodriguez will show off his Puskas prize for last year's best goal. Madrid-based daily sports paper AS has already held a séance to call on the spirit of former player Juanito to inspire a comeback – but all that might not be enough against the might of Atletico Madrid.

Coach Diego Simeone has spoken of the feeling of invincibility his team have in two-legged affairs, scoring twice at the Vicente Calderon without conceding means they go into this game as favourites despite a doubt over striker Mario Mandzukic who has a virus.

If he fails to make it then it could be a memorable return to the Santiago Bernabeu for Fernando Torres. 'He is here to give us experience and goals when the team most needs it,' said Simeone in the build-up to the game.

His players were snubbed in the FifaPro team of the year announced at Zurich on Monday without a single player making the XI and that will only fire them up more in-front of a global audience. 'I am not imagining a calm game; I'm imagining an intense one,' said Simeone who added: 'We have a positive result from the first leg but we are up against the world and European club champions.'

Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo stare on in disbelief as Real Madrid slump to defeat against Atletico 

Real Madrid are expected to start the game with Gareth Bale, joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in the so-called BBC front three. Bale was criticised for not passing to Benzema in the opening defeat of 2015 against Valencia. And he was then in trouble for not passing to Ronaldo at the weekend against Espanyol.

'I don't think it was so easy for him to make the pass,' said Ancelotti, as he defended the player who scored the goal that won Real Madrid the Spanish Cup last season. He also confirmed that Bale's relationship with Ronaldo was 'excellent'.

Madrid's frightening front three have proved too much for defences all over Europe and beyond across the last 18 months but Atletico Madrid have frequently frustrated them.

Simeone has won 16 of 19 knockout matches he has taken charge of and since Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final in 2013 – ending 14 years without a victory over their neighbours – they have beaten them four times, drawn twice and lost on only three occasions.

Ronaldo will be wearing his new micro-diamond encrusted boots to celebrate his third Golden Ball win. That is unlikely to do much to lessen the desire Atletico have to turn over their wealthier city neighbours one more time.
