Stoke City Football Club has been rocked by historic assault claims allegedly carried out by senior players in the 1980s, it has been revealed.

Eight former apprentice players have reportedly claimed senior footballers made them suffer 'humiliating' abuse while they played at the club.

One ­alleged victim said he was assaulted by a first team player who coated a rubber glove with a  muscle soothing cream before using it to abuse him as part of an 'initiation ceremony'.

Former apprentice players claim they were abused by senior footballers at Stoke City FC, it has been reported

Staffordshire Police 
­confirmed they launched an ­investigation into the claims in 2008 - which saw witnesses questioned by officers over the allegations. They also spoke with four men in connection to the claims.

At the time the Crown Prosecution Service told the apprentices there was insufficient evidence and no action was taken.

According to the Sunday People,
following several high-profile abuse cases such as the Jimmy Savile 
scandal, the men, all in their teens when the abuse allegedly took 
place, have reportedly resumed the case.

The men are thought to have passed on details of the alleged abuse to legal
experts - who are reportedly drawing up plans for the case.

Stoke officials said they 'fully co-operated' with an ­investigation in 2008. They said there was no ­question of any staff at Stoke City FC taking place in any alleged abuse.

A spokesman told the newspaper: 'Stoke City Football Club is aware of historical ­allegations which have been made against former players of the club relating to the 1980s.

'The police conducted investigations into various claims against those former players five years ago.

'The club cooperated fully with those investigations.

It is alleged the assaults took place in the 1980s - when the club played at the Victoria Stadium, pictured

'The club understands that no charges were brought against any of the individuals involved, all of whom left the club over 20 years ago.

'The club can give absolute ­reassurance that it is fully committed to the safety and protection of ­individuals at the club and has robust safeguarding policies in place which are frequently reviewed and updated.'

Chief Superintendent Bernie O’Reilly 
from Staffordshire Police said: 'Staffordshire Police investigated some 
historic allegations against former players.

'The investigation included ­speaking with a number of witnesses and voluntarily interviewing four people.

'Consultation was ­regularly made with the Crown Prosecution Service and a decision was made not to ­prosecute anyone.'

'We treat any allegation of this nature extremely seriously and I would encourage any victims to make contact with us.

'We
have specially trained ­detectives who will support and sensitively 
work with them. We will thoroughly ­investigate any allegations made to 
us, regardless of how long ago the offences took place.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
