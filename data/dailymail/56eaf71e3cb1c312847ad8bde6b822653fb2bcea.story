Katie Howe, 22, from County Durham, entered a McDonald's drive-thru via the exit while twice over the limit

A woman has been banned from getting behind the wheel after causing chaos at a McDonald's drive-thru by drunkenly driving the wrong way around it.

Katie Howe, 22, was twice the legal alcohol limit when she tried to enter through the exit, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard.

Howe, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned for 20 months and 
fined £110, with a £20 victim surcharge.

The court heard how she damaged two other cars as she pulled her Vauxhall Corsa into the McDonald's restaurant at Coatham Mundeville, near Darlington, County Durham, on November 17.

John Garside, prosecuting, described how she tried to go into the drive-thru section the wrong way.

He said her actions meant that two cars, who were trying to use the facility properly, had to reverse rapidly and were damaged.

Howe's car was not damaged in the incident.

Police
were called to the scene and Howe gave a breath test reading of 73mg of
alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35m.

Up to four in five motorists risk 
exceeding the drink-drive limit by miscalculating the alcoholic content 
of pub measures, a recent study revealed.

Some 80 per cent underestimate the unit content in a pint of lager and 55 per cent get it wrong on a large glass of wine.

Carole Whittingham, national secretary of the Campaign 
Against Drinking and Driving said: ‘Most people do not have a clue about
how many units they have consumed ‘There is so much confusion. Not even
a mathematician could work out how many units you have had.’

The ICM survey of 2,028 adults,  commissioned by LV= car insurance, also found that 15 per cent of motorists confessed they had got behind the wheel while over the limit.
