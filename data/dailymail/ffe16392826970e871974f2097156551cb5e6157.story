This is the moment a superyacht worth millions of pounds was destroyed today after a fire broke out on board.

Nearby workers raised the alarm after smoke was seen billowing from the yacht at the East Cowes Marina on the Isle of Wight shortly after 1pm.

Eyewitnesses described how flames quickly engulfed the vessel, melting its fibreglass hull before part of it collapsed into the water.

The 76ft long yacht named Kahu, which was worth more than £8million, was parked up in the marina because it was up for sale.

Blaze: Black smoke could be seen billowing from the vessel after the fire broke out shortly after 1pm today

Local residents were told to stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed because of the large volume of smoke.

Drinkers in a nearby pub were also told to stay put while firefighters made the area safe.

Fortunately, firefighters were able to stop the blaze from spreading to other yachts, with quick thinking marina staff moving any vessels immediately next to the fire.

It is not immediately clear how the fire started, but no one is thought to have been injured.

Morgan Strange, who works opposite the marina, said: 'Obviously there was a lot of black smoke and then the flames started to spread pretty quickly up to the fly-bridge at which point the radar dome caught fire and then collapsed onto the fly-bridge.'

It was feared at one stage that the superyacht would sink beneath the surface as it was loaded with nine tonnes of diesel.

Tim Griffin, the owner of another boat which was moored near the Kahu, said: 'The marina staff were quick to act and moved any boats near her.

The Harbour Masters’s Sea Clear was on hand with fire pumps and firemen on board.

'They think the Kahu will sink due to weight of water on her, although nine tonnes of diesel could be a pain for pollution.

'It is such a shame as she was a sight to be seen at the marina.'

Drinkers were holed up inside a nearby pub to avoid fumes pouring out from the blazing luxury yacht.

Fire crews told customers not to leave The Lifeboat pub as they worked to dampen down flames.

Barmaid Stephanie Rennie said the 
windows and doors had to be blockaded on instruction by police officers 
after smoke and soot from the boat covered tables and came in 
through the windows and doors.

Miss Rennie said: 'It smelt really grim. I thought I was in for a quiet day.

'But it seems to have escalated and it has got quite dramatic.'

The Kahu, which was built in 2011 and could sleep up to six guests in three staterooms, was listed in June by brokers Ancasta.

The advert for the vessel stated that the boat was the 'highest specified and most desirable Nordhavn on the market today.'

It added that the Kahu was owned by an
experienced yachtsman who was very much involved at the design, 
specification and build stages and as a result, the yacht was fitted 
with 'some excellent custom requests which had significantly enhanced 
the desirability'.

It described the accommodation as remarkable and added that it was especially designed by an independent interior designer.

According to the listing, the stylish 
wooden venetian blinds, honey coloured Novasuede panels and custom teak 
joinery fitted to the deck heads all helped to create a homely long term
cruising motor yacht.

The vessel also featured a BOSE surround sound system and a retractable 47inch Toshiba television.

The Environment Agency was notified of the fire by the Isle of Wight fire service in case of pollution.

A spokesman said: 'Two Environment officers are in attendance at the site to manage the environmental impact of the incident.

'At the moment, no pollution has been observed, and the officers will remain on site to monitor the situation.'
