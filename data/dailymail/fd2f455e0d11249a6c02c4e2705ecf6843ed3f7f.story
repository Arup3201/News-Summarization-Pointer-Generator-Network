A Brazilian artist has created a portfolio of people with albinism, bringing the young and old together for a set of poignant pictures.

Gustavo Lacerda, from Sao Paulo wanted to feature 'those who have always been an outsider' and bring them to the forefront through his photographic work.

People with albinism are born with little or no pigmentation in their 
eyes, skin and hair or sometimes just in their eyes 
alone. The eyes are especially affected and albinos can often be cross eyed or have general poor vision.

Vision: 'Since the beginning of 2009 I have been researching the universe of albinos and trying to bring them to the front of the camera' says the artist

Mr Lacerda encouraged a range of people who have albinism to come to his studio and pose

Mr Lacerda encouraged a range of people who have the condition to come to his studio and pose for his website.

'Since the beginning of 2009 I have 
been researching the universe of albinos and trying to bring them to the
front of the camera,' said Mr Lacerda.

He said he decided to photograph his subjects in the studio, 'valuing and seeking to mystify the production process, such as costumes,
hair/makeup and backgrounds.'

'I chose the posing portrait in studio, valuing and seeking to mystify the production process' said Mr Lacerda

Some of the subjects are looking directly at the camera, same are 'in action' shots and some are even looking away

'The idea was to put them clearly in the forefront, a new situation for those who have always been an outsider,' said Mr Lacerda

Mr Lacerda said the focus  caused some of the subjects discomfort
in the beginning, but they were also proud.

He added that capturing the moment 'with fidelity has been a major challenge and there arises the essence of the work.'

All the images were captured from a digital back and printed on Hahnemuhle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth large format.

Albinism is a genetic condition and occurs when a person inherits one or more faulty genes - in turn this means they do not produce the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin

Albinism is a genetic condition and occurs when a person inherits one or more faulty genes - in turn this means they do not produce the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin.

It affects all races - it can be inherited but in most cases, there's no family history.

With age, some people can gain a little 
pigmentation in their hair or eyes with age, or they may develop pigmented 
freckles on their skin.

'This focus has caused them discomfort in the beginning, a certain strangeness to most of those portrayed but, at the same time, proud too,' said Mr Lacerda

In 2010 Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci broke the style mould with a striking series of ads starring albino model Stephen Thompson.

Inspired by a Robert Mapplethorpe print of a white Roman bust on a piece of leopard-print fabric, the image shows Thompson posing alongside supermodel Daphne Groeneveld, whose hair has been bleached white to match his.

Tisci told industry title WWD that he had always admired albino people, and explained how pale flesh tones were a key feature of his designs.

'They’re very near my world,' he said.

Thompson was previously represented by the now defunct Ugly modeling agency, which represented unusual faces.
