A former marine has been sentenced to death for being his part in the murder of an Iraq veteran and his wife only two months after they got married. 

Kesaun Kedron Sykes, 27,  was convicted in August for killing Sergeant Jan Pietrzak, 24, and his wife Quiana Jenkins-Pietrzak, 26, in 2008.

The Iraq vet forced to watch as his wife was raped by four men, one of them Skyes, before they were were both shot in the head by their attackers.

Damning: Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Daniel DeLimon (pictured in court on Friday) said Skyes had 'earned his place on death row'

When Skyes was found guilty, jurors recommended that he be sentenced to death for the violent crime. 

Emrys John, 23, and Tyrone Miller, 25, were both given the death penalty in 2013 for their roles in the 2008 killings in Riverside County, California. 

A third ex-Marine, Kevin Cox, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Sykes was the fourth person to be convicted. 

Sgt Pietrzak was an Iraq war veteran who was stationed at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego.

His wife was a counsellor with an infant care programme in Riverside County.

The couple had been married for just two months. 

Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Daniel DeLimon told the Fresno Bee that Sykes participated in the sexual assault and began trying to set fire to the home before the couple were killed.

Newlyweds: The couple had only been married for two months when the four men broke into their home and brutally attacked them 

He said: 'He earned his place on death row. If people are still alive, and you're trying to burn the house down on top of them, obviously, you are in, you are in all the way.'

Sykes' lawyer, Doug Myers, said he recognizes the loss and pain suffered by the victims' loved ones, but Sykes did not deserve the death sentence.

He claims that his client was outside the home when the killings occurred.

'A death sentence for Kesaun, who was not the actual killer, who did not direct the killings, and who was exposed to such awful abuse and neglect throughout most of his life, was not warranted,' Myers said.
