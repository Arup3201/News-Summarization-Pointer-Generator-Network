From the Birth of Venus to the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, the naked human form has long been a source of artistic inspiration.

Now some of the best have been gathered together in a stunning new book, which draws on the extensive photo archive at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

Edited by associate curatorm Paul Martineau, The Nude in Photography includes 78 works, ranging from classic shots by the likes of Man Ray to the glossy modern nudes created by Chinese artist, Hiro.

Knowing: Felix Jacques Moulin's 1856 nude nods to Manet's famous portrait of a prostitute, Olympia

Iconic: Herbs Ritts' famous photo of nude supermodels, among them Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington

But it's not all photography. The book also contains images of classical Greek and Roman sculpture, the source of some of the world's earliest nudes, as well as references to the likes of Titian's Venus D'Urbino.

Much, however, focuses on the nude in photography and its surprisingly lengthy history, which began with the invention of the camera in the mid 1800s.

Indeed, according to historians, the history of photography actually pre-dates the invention of the camera, with camera obscura techniques used by the ancient Greeks.

The first photograph of the sort modern viewers would recognise was a partially successful image taken in 1816 by French inventor, Nicéphore Niépce.

Niépce was also the first to create a box camera, using one, in 1826, to photograph a 17th century Flemish relief of a man using a horse.

Spectacular: Chinese artist Hiro created this work, Bodyscape, in New York in 1971

Pioneering: Jeremiah Gurney's 1852 Portrait of an American Youth is one of the earliest photographic nudes

Musical: Man Ray's 1924 Le Violen d'Ingres is one of the most famous nude photographs ever taken

When, in 1839, Louis Daguerre invented the first practical method of fixing photographs, the stage was set for a new type of artwork - the photographic nude.

Some of the most beautiful date from the early days of the art form, with 19th century masters such as Julia Margaret Cameron, Edgar Degas and Thomas Eakins combining the new technology with classical composition.

One especially lovely effort is Felix Jacques Moulin's 1856 nude which, with her knowing glance and draped couch, nods firmly to Manet's Olympia.

More still are the work of 20th-century artists Man Ray, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward
 Weston, as well as innovative photographers Bill Brandt, Harry Callahan, and Minor White.

The latter half of the 20th century is represented by the likes of Diane Arbus, Robert Mapplethorpe and Herb Ritts, and contemporary artists Chuck Close, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and Mona Kuhn.

Whether Hiro's glossy technicolour shots or Moulin's robust nudes, the beauty of the naked human form continues to fascinate and inspire photographers even to this day.
