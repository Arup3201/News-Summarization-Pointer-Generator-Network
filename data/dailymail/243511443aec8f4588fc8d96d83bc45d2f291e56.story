The former wife of a Florida police officer accused of being in the Ku Klux Klan has told investigators they were on an undercover operation.

Ann Hunnewell claimed she and her ex-husband, George Hunnewell, joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom.

She said they were trying to find out if another officer was a KKK member. After investigating,  she and her ex-husband  later left the group.

Ann Hunnewell was a secretary for the police department before leaving in 2010.   

Her statements were contained in a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report tying officer Hunnewell and Deputy Chief David Borst to the KKK.

Borst, a veteran officer with more than 20 years of law enforcement service, resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A phone number listed for Borst was disconnected. Hunnewell's number was not listed.

The information about the former officers was given to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement by the FBI.

Parts of the Florida report were redacted and it's not clear what the FBI was investigating when it discovered the officers link to the KKK.

An FBI spokesman in Jacksonville hasn't responded to a voicemail.

Undercover? George Hunnewell's former wife said they joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom

It isn't a criminal offense to be in the Ku Klux Klan, but local police chief Terry Isaacs said he had to consider how the allegations might affect the officers' credibility and the perception of the department in the community (stock photo)

Ann Hunnewell told investigators that she and her former husband never paid dues, attended meetings or witnessed any criminal activity.

She also said there was no documentation of their undercover operation.

Fruitland Park Police Chief Terry Isaacs wasn't in his office yesterday and City Manager Gary La Venia wouldn't comment. La Venia said the police chief would issue a statement on Wednesday. 

Previously, Isaacs has said the document was given to him to consider how the allegations might affect the officers' credibility and the perception of the department in the community.

The FBI has assured the police chief that there are no other officers involved.

Fruitland Park has 13 full-time and five part-time cops, and many were trained by Borst. 

In 2009, Fruitland Park Police Officer James Elkins resigned after pictures surfaced of him in uniform with a pointy Klan hood and robe. 

The police department has 13 officers for the city has about 5,000 residents. It is located about 40 miles north-west of Orlando.

Fruitland Park was once known for its citrus groves and is in Lake County, where KKK violence in the 1940s and 1950s was rampant.

The State Attorney's Office told city officials that pending cases from the officers will be reviewed, although Borst's job was primarily administrative and didn't involve much patrolling, La Venia said.
