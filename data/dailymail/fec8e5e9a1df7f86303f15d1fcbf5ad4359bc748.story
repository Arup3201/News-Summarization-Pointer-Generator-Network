Under pressure: Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron delivers a speech in Lagos, Nigeria, today, before flying back to the UK

David Cameron was dragged deeper into the phone-hacking saga last night after it emerged that a key suspect gave media advice to his office in the run-up to the General Election.

Ex-News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis – arrested last week – acted as an informal adviser to Mr Cameron’s former communications chief Andy Coulson.

Wallis, nicknamed Wolfman during his Fleet Street days, has already precipitated the downfall of Met commander Sir Paul Stephenson and his deputy John Yates.

Sir Paul resigned on Sunday after revelations that Wallis had been employed by the Metropolitan Police as a PR consultant.

The following day Yates quit as assistant commissioner following a suspension over his relationship with Wallis and his handling of the phone-hacking crisis.

Last night the Conservative Party issued a statement confirming that Mr Wallis – Mr Coulson’s deputy when he edited the paper – continued to advise him after he had started working for Mr Cameron.

A spokesman said: ‘It has been drawn to our attention that he may have provided Andy Coulson with some informal advice on a voluntary basis before the election.

‘We can confirm that apart from Andy Coulson, neither David Cameron nor any senior member of the campaign team were aware of this until this week.’

The spokesman said that neither Mr 
Wallis nor his PR firm ‘has ever been contracted by the Conservative 
Party, nor has the Conservative Party made payments to either of them’.

But the disclosure remains damaging 
for Mr Cameron. He has repeatedly faced questions over his judgment in 
handing Mr Coulson a ‘second chance’ when he appointed him in 2007, 
following his resignation from the News of the World.

In a separate 
twist, it also emerged that one of David Cameron’s most senior officials
stopped Scotland Yard from briefing the Prime Minister on the 
phone-hacking scandal.

MPs heard yesterday how Ed Llewellyn,
Mr Cameron’s chief of staff, rejected an offer by outgoing assistant 
commissioner John Yates to talk to Mr Cameron after the New York Times 
ran an article alleging that Mr Coulson ‘actively encouraged’ phone 
hacking while he was editor of the News of the World.

Mr Llewellyn, an old school friend of
Mr Cameron and one of his most trusted advisers, flatly rejected the 
offer on the grounds that it was ‘inappropriate’ and adding that he 
‘would be grateful if it were not raised please’.

No 10 yesterday took the unusual step
of releasing the email exchange between Mr Yates and Mr Llewellyn. 
Downing Street officials stressed that Mr Llewellyn had cleared his 
response with Downing Street Permanent Secretary Jeremy Haywood.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
said: ‘After the election [Mr Llewellyn] was given serious warnings 
about Andy Coulson, and in November he was offered information about 
police action on new allegations.

‘Surely the Prime Minister needed to 
be told, especially as on both occasions it had serious implications for
the Prime Minister’s judgment in continuing to employ Andy Coulson.’
