Danielle Stoton, 18, was critically injured in a crash as she walked home from a party on Sunday

A teenage hit-and-run victim was left fighting for her life after being hit on her way home from a party – 12 years after she survived a near-death experience.

Danielle Stoton, 18, remains on a life support machine after she was knocked over in Armthorpe, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The teenager survived a previous near-death experience when she was six after she hit her head in a swimming pool and almost drowned.

Her parents, Michelle and Paul Stoton, stay at her bedside in the neuro-critical unit at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, and hope she will pull through like she did before.

Mrs Stoton, 41, said: ‘We were on holiday in Andalucia when she slipped and banged her head, then lost consciousness and slipped underwater.

‘Her lungs filled with water and a man fished her out. She was “dead” and looked blue. I worked on a children’s ward as an auxiliary nurse so I knew.’

Mrs Stoton said her family friend, Lesley Winder, helped save her daughter’s life on the holiday and is at her bedside this time around 12 years later.

‘My friend Lesley gave her CPR and after a couple of minutes she vomited. She was taken to hospital by ambulance and put on a ventilator.

‘In the night she woke up, and that’s when she said she had seen a light.

‘I believe in these things. Perhaps Lesley can work a miracle again and bring her back to us.’

The couple has been told that their daughter has no spinal injury, however, the extent of the trauma to her brain was not yet clear.

Mrs Stoton added: ‘Her jaw was broken and the segment broke off and touched her brain. She has a massive cut in her neck and one under her lip. She has lost her top four teeth.

‘They sat her up on Tuesday and she looked better, but she is on life support, has a chest infection and is allergic to penicillin.

‘We were told it would be Thursday at least before she can be roused from her coma.’

Her husband, Mr Stoton, 46, added: ‘We know at least that she is recognising sounds. I feel a lot better at that. My heart isn’t quite as broken.’

After recently losing six stones, Miss Stoton – who was due to have her braces removed this week after four years - had hoped to begin a sports science course next month in a bid to become a personal trainer with the RAF.

Her mother has kept hundreds of well-wishers informed on her daughter’s progress via Facebook, and said they have all been lifted by the heart-warming messages posted to them.

Mrs Stoton said her daughter will be ‘eternally grateful’ for the community page ‘Get Well Soon Danielle’.

Police have arrested two women, aged 23 and 26, in connection with the incident and both have been bailed pending further enquiries.

Her parents Michelle and Paul Stoton hope she will pull through like before and set up a support Facebook page
