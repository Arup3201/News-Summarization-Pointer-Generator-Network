French Interior Minister Manuel Valls has called for a renegotiation of 'certain agreements' to ease the burden of managing immigrants in Calais

An outspoken French Minister has called on Britain to loosen its immigration policy to ease the pressure on guards at Calais, caused by immigrants waiting to enter the UK.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls has criticized the 'impasse' in communication between British border authorities and their French counterparts in the English Channel port.

He has even invited the Home Secretary Theresa May to visit the area to see the pressure on French border guards.

Speaking at the port yesterday, Valls said: 'We need full and complete cooperation between all parties.

'We will also, no doubt, need to flesh out and renegotiate certain agreements, in order to reinforce Franceâ€™s cooperation with Britain and Europe.'

The issue of migrant camps in Calais has been a thorn in the side of successive governments in France with a solution to the growing numbers staying there, yet to be resolved.

As political pressure increases, guards have been accused of turning a blind-eye to immigrants who are sneaking into the UK, where they become the problem of British authorities.

Valls said Britain should understand the plight of French guards and 'develop' its immigration policy accordingly.

He said: 'Our British friends must realise the burden, the weight, which is on France.

'At the time (of original border agreements), the idea was that the UK would evolve and develop its immigration policy.'

A
spokesperson for the UK Home Office said would not comment on the offer for the Home Secretary to visit.

They did respond to the called for reform in a statement, however, saying: 'Border Force has staff in 
Northern France to stop individuals before they reach the UK and in the 
year to April 2013, 11,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were 
prevented.

'Border Force works collaboratively and successfully with the French authorities to combat cross-channel illegal migration and the organised criminality behind it.'

According to AFP up to 500 undocumented migrants currently live in semi-permanent camps at Calais.

But that number is dramatically lower 
than a few years ago when a raid by French Police in 2009 on known camps
such as a wooded area called 'the jungle', full of mainly Afghan 
immigrants was cleared.

The French seaside village of Sangatte, has seen its population more than doubled by an immigrant camp

It is not the first time that Valls has suggested a compassionate solution to a prickly issue.

Earlier this year he championed new guidelines for the French Gendarmes which read: ' 'Police and gendarmes are placed at 
the service of population. Their relationship with the public should be 
characterised by courtesy and excludes the use of 'tu'.

'Their
behaviour should be exemplary in all circumstances and respect the 
dignity of others. It should inspire respect and consideration.'
