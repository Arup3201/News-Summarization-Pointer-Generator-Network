Belgium boss Marc Wilmots admits the closing stages of his side's 2-1 extra-time victory over USA were no good for his heart rate.

After a thrilling last-16 match that was goalless at 90 minutes, former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne and substitute Romelu Lukaku gave the Belgians a two-goal lead before Julian Green pulled one back for Jurgen Klinsmann’s men with 12 minutes to go.

‘For my heart, please don’t give me too many games like this,’ said Wilmots, who must now get his team ready for a last-eight tie in Brasilia on Saturday against Argentina, who earlier beat Switzerland with a late extra-time winner of their own from Angel Di Maria.

‘We are not favourites against Argentina but there is a lack of balance in their team.

‘We will play well against a stronger opponent.’

And Wilmots admitted it had been 'scary' after Green's goal.

He said: 'We had a lot of opportunities, and we dominated the game, and in the end it was well deserved even if it was scary with the US goal.

'Lukaku had been much criticised, and I told him, "do not worry - the second round might be your day", and that's what happened.

'Tom Howard had a fantastic match but we need to forget about this match and focus on Argentina.

'There shouldn't be any more worries from the media about us not playing football.'

Lukaku himself was modest about his impact, saying: 'I'm not the hero - it's the team that is. There are many players who have made a big difference since the start of this competition.'
