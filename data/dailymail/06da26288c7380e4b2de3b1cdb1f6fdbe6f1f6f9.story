A teenager who has been jailed for five years for raping a six-year-old boy knew exactly what he was doing when he carried out the sickening attack, a crown court judge has said. 

Judge Brian Forster QC said the attacker from South Tyneside, who was 15 at the time of the offence, took advantage of the schoolboy for his 'own sexual satisfaction'.

He added that he was 'quite sure' that the teenager - who the court heard has become a 'hate target' since the attack - knew what he was doing was 'very wrong'.

Speaking at Newcastle Crown Court, the judge said: 'The circumstances were fully considered by the jury during the course of the trial.

'I had the opportunity to assess you during the course of the trial and I am quite sure you knew what you were doing was very wrong.'

The attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denied his guilt, meaning the young victim was forced to give evidence at the trial.

But jurors convicted the defendant - who the judge described as 'cocky' - of two charges of rape. Both charges related to the one incident which took place last year.

The court also heard how, just months after raping the boy, the teenager was convicted of having sex with an underage girl.

The judge added: 'You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that the long term impact of this type of offending on a young victim is unknown.

'I have found you to be a cocky young man. I noted the way which you answered questions and it is clear to me you knew that what you were doing was very wrong.' 

For the defence, David Callan said the teen, who the court heard has poor school attendance, had become a hate target and was recently hospitalised after a violent attack.

He added that the attacker was immature for his age.

In sentencing the teenager, the judge said he needed to consider the defendant's welfare, but also needed to prevent him from commmitting further crimes.

He  ordered the defendant, who is now 16, to sign the sex offenders' register for life.

The defendant was also put under a sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years.
