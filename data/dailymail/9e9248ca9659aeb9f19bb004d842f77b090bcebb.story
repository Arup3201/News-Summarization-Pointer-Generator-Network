This is the heartwarming moment a dog gets the 'paw-fect' night's sleep thanks to some TLC from a pooch pal.

A new home video shows Jackson the Double Doodle lay on the couch, twitching his paws through the air as he has a bad dream.

Sensing her friend's distress, Laika the Goldendoodle jumps into the frame and gives him a comforting hug.

The large canine gets on top of Jackson and wraps her fluffy paws around him.

The two dogs then peacefully snuggle. 

According to the video's uploader, Brooke Conti, the two pets from Boston are the best of friends.

Indeed, their Instagram account @doodlejackson features dozens of images of them hanging out together.
