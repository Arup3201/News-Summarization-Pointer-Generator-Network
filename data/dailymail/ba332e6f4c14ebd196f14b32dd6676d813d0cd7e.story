Thousands of Christmas carolers gathered Saturday evening too sing outside the home of a terminally ill Pennsylvania girl.

The singers are fulfilling one of 8-year-old Delaney Brown's wishes: a huge holiday sing-along outside her West Reading home.

Delaney was diagnosed with a rare of leukaemia in May and given just days to live on Wednesday.

Last wish: Thousands gathered Saturday evening outside the West Reading, Pennsylvania home of 8-year-old Delaney Brown, who is dying from a rare form of cancer

'I can hear you now!!! Love you!': Delaney showed her appreciation for the throng of Christmas well-wishers in a Facebook post on Saturday night as she lay stuck in her bed

Touching: Over 4,000 people said they'd attend Delaney's sing-along and photos show a huge crowd outside the ailing 8-year-old's Pennsylvania home

Saturday’s Christmas miracle came just one day after her eighth birthday, when Delaney fulfilled another wish by speaking with pop superstar Taylor Swift via video chat.

On her Team Laney Facebook page, a picture of Delaney giving two thumbs up was accompanied by the text, ‘I can hear you now!!! Love you!’

The heart-warming event was born after Delaney’s family heard her grim prognosis last week, which her mother shared via Facebook.

‘Today we were told the worst news of our lives,’ wrote Delaney’s mom Jennifer Brown. ‘Laney has 70% cancer cells in her blood. If they would treat the cancer the virus that she has would kill her. And if they treat the virus the cancer will kill her.’

Rare: Delaney has a serious and very rare form of childhood leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7

Bucket list: Another wish on Delaney's bucket list was to be a baby sitter, which she got to fulfill last week when a friend of the family brought over their 7-week-old baby for her to watch over, though it left her weak

Brave: The brave little girl has remained upbeat, her parents say, and was even courageous enough to mark off another wish from her list--to pet an alligator

Delaney suffers from a rare form of childhood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7, ‘making her quite rare,’ according to the Facebook page.

Just 10 children a year are diagnosed with the illness in America.

The sweet but tough little girl, who loves fashion and swimming in the ocean, has now been through five rounds of radiation and a stem cell transplant.

Photos of the beautiful gathering, which over 4,000 people indicated on Facebook they’d attend, show throngs of supporters outside Delaney’s home—many in Santa hats and holding candles as they gave the brave girl her Christmas wish.

Thousands have started to follow Delaney's Facebook page Team Delaney since her diagnosis and her family used it to bring a crowd of carolers to their home on Saturday night

Singer Taylor Swift, who grew up in the neighboring town of  Wyomissing, also helped Delaney knock an item off her bucket list.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation helped connect Swift with the Brown family last week when it became clear that Delaney has very little time left.

‘Laney was so nervous to talk to her because she is such a ‘famous celebrity,’ Jennifer Brown wrote on Facebook. ‘I was actually worried that when Taylor Facetimed her that she would be to scared to talk but Taylor was fabulous!! She really engaged Laney in conversation. Laney lit up and had a huge smile on her face. I can't thank Taylor enough.’

'Prior to her cancer she was a normal kid,' writes Delaney's mother. 'Spent as much time as possible at the pool or in the ocean. She also loved to dance in ballet. She loves animal prints, hot pink, and she has a special eye for fashion!'
