This year's alligator hunting season is one for the history books in Mississippi, where the record has been shattered twice just days after hunting began.

The new heaviest gator ever caught in the state was pulled from waters near Vicksburg on Sunday and weighed a whopping 792-pounds.

Just the day before, the record had been broken when a 756-pounder was snagged.

Historical hunting season: The gator beat the previous record, set just the day before, by just 36 pounds

Sunday's record beast measured 13.5 feet and was pulled in by a 3-man team led by Brian Montgomery of Starkville, reports WAPT.

Shockingly, both Montgomery's team and the group that set the record the day before included Scott Berry of Raymond, Mississippi.

Just three days into the season, Berry witnessed two all-time record catches.

'That's a unique experience that someone could be involved in two records in one season, and certainly within three days,' Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks' Alligator Program coordinator Ricky Flynt told the Clarion-Ledger.

Plenty more time: Experts say there will likely be another record-setter before the season, which has weeks more to go, is over

Despite the massive size of the Mississippi gator (pictured), it's no world record. Just last month, an over 1,000-pound alligator was snagged in Alabama

Flynt says the gators in Mississippi have likely always been so massive, but people are getting better at finding the behemoths. 

For this reason, not to mention the weeks left of alligator hunting season in the state, Flynt figures the record will be broken again soon.

'I will not be surprised if they get one that exceeds 1,000 pounds and is 14 feet or longer,' he told NBC.

In August, that very thing happened in neighboring Alabama when Mandy Stokes and her family snagged a 1,000-pound alligator--along with a nearly intact deer carcass later culled from its stomach.
