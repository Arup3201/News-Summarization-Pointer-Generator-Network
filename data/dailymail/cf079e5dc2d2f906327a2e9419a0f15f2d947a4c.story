Michael Brown's family 'strenuously object' to the grand jury decision, their attorney said at a press conference just hours after it emerged that Darren Wilson will not be charged for killing their son.

Attorney Benjamin Crump slammed St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's announcement and the lawmakers' lack of thoroughness during the press conference on Tuesday.

The teenager's father, Mike Brown Sr., stood beside Crump and the Reverend Al Sharpton as they called for justice and for the implementation of the Michael Brown Law.

The law calls for every police officer across the country to wear a body camera so that citizens can see how confrontations with authorities unfold.

Angry: Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Michael Brown's family, spoke out on Tuesday and said they 'strenuously object' to the grand jury's decision and to the process that allowed them to reach it

Speaking on Tuesday, Crump said that he and the family went through all of the information that was released by the prosecutors on Monday 'and saw how completely unfair this process was'.

He demanded to know why more questions weren't asked of Wilson.

'A first year law student would have done a better job of cross examining,' he said.

'When was his veracity ever challenged? When was his credibility ever challenged?... No one held up the pictures and said, but that's not consistent with the physical evidence?' 

Crump said that he believed the 'symbiotic relationship' between the police and the prosecutors meant that Wilson was never properly questioned. 

'This process is broken,' he said. 'We could foresee what the outcome was going to be and that's what occurred last night.'

He called for prosecutors to appoint people with no relationships to the people involved in cases so that people can believe in the system.

In addition, he called for the implementation of the Michael Brown Law.

'This system is so unfair to the citizens,' he added. 'We ask that everybody join us in demanding change and making a difference for the lives of our children.'

Rev. Al Sharpton, who also attended the press conference, said that they were determined to fight for justice for the teenager. 

'This is not our first rodeo, McCulloch,' he said in comments directed at the prosecutor. 'We will deal with this in the way civil leaders act.' 

Ahead of the grand jury decision on Monday, Michael Brown Sr. released a statement, which called for peace as well as four-and-a-half minutes of silence after the announcement.

Decision: St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch is pictured on Monday as he announces the grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson 

'We are not here to be violent,' he said. 'We are here in memory of our son. We are here for protection of all children. We are here to support justice and equality for all people.

'We lift our voices to ensure black and brown men, women, and children can live in this country without being devalued because of the color of our skin.'  

After the decision was announced on Monday night, Michael Brown's family reacted with raw emotion outside the Ferguson police department. 

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband. She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown', the New York Times reported. 

'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!'

Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face.

'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son! They still don't care!' she screamed as she threw her arms in frustration. 'They never going to care!'

She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.'

He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. 

As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters.

McSpadden had found out the news in a hotel room where she waited with her family and their attorney and also ran from the room crying, her attorney said.

Crump said the family still has hope that a federal civil rights investigation will hold the officer and the police department accountable.  

They will also consider filing a civil wrongful death lawsuit, he said.

'The family felt the whole process was completely unfair to them,' he said. 'Police officers are not held accountable when they kill young people of color.'

The family released a statement immediately after the news via their lawyers which read: 'We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions.

'While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change.  

'We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen... Let's not just make noise, let's make a difference.'
