It's undoubtedly the hottest ticket in town and only a selection of fashion's finest VIP guests, including Anna Wintour, David Gandy and Jourdan Dunn, were lucky enough to grace the front row of today's Burberry Prorsum menswear AW15 show.

Part of London Collection's: Men, the show, which took place at  Kensington Gardens, was inspired by all things bohemian and was Christopher Bailey's most wearable menswear range to date.

The Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, who champions budding musicians, called on British singer-songwriter Clare Maguire to perform four live songs, including one written specifically for the collection to kick off proceedings.

Christopher Bailey sent his male models down a tiled runway in a classically Bohemian show - think paisley prints, shearling coats and frinched ponchos

The 'Clasically Bohemian' show was a story of vibrant outwear, classic tailoring and, of course, an updated spin on the trench coat and beloved Burberry poncho.

The trench is muted in natural hues for AW15 and comes in ivy green, taupe, purple and the perfect shade of yellow. There were shearling coats, too, in navy, as well as paisley shirts aplenty, sometimes worn with animal print.

Elsewhere there was suede, tassled scarves, jumbo cord and even shirts and bags with smatterings of sequins. The poncho comes fringed and leopard is introduced for the upcoming colder months - even splashed over bags (keep your eyes peeled for the new The Carryall tote).

The stellar collection was watched from the front row by Vogue cover girl Jourdan Dunn, Anna Wintour, Natalie Massenet, Nick Grimshaw, David Gandy and Tinie Tempah.

The show was a lesson in layering and paisley was often clashed with animal prints, while Bailey introduced 'The Scholar' eyewear range on the runway

Glitter fell from the ceiling onto the tiled runway at the end of the dramatic show, which saw Clare Maguire  perform four live songs, including one written specifically for the collection

Bags came in grainy leather and with floral prints - some were embellished with sequins

Burberry boss Christopher Bailey always manages to get it right - and attract the glitziest fashion crowd.

In December, he unveiled David and Victoria Beckham's son, Romeo, as the star of his Christmas campaign. Of course, Romeo had school so didn't attend the show today.

Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne also recently fronted the brand's fragrance campaign, while Jourdan Dunn and Naomi Campbell lent their good looks to the SS15 campaign.
