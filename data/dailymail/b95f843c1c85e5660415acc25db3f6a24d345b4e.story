Coronation Street star Bill Roache has dropped his attempt to claim back £100,000 of legal costs from his rape trial, saying he ‘wants to move on with his life’.

After his acquittal earlier this year the actor’s lawyers said they were planning to take action to recover the money from taxpayers.

However, the 82-year-old, who recently returned to his role as Ken Barlow on the soap, said he no longer wishes to pursue the claim, despite his legal bills being in excess of £100,000.

He has reportedly told friends: ‘I just want to move on and put the nightmare behind me.’

Mr Roache was found not guilty by a jury of two counts of rape and four counts of indecent assault in February after a four-week trial.

A source close to the actor told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Initially Bill and his legal team did look into trying to recoup the money. But Bill has now decided he will no longer be going down that road.’

The source added: ‘It would have been a long, drawn-out process and Bill is desperate to draw a line under what was a truly horrific ordeal for him and his family.

‘Instead he is focusing on getting on with the rest of his life and doing what he loves – being on Coronation Street. He is the happiest he has been in a long time.'
