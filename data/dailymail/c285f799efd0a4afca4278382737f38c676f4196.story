Adventurer Ben Fogle and his wife Marina have said that regular 'MOT' therapy sessions with a marriage counsellor have helped them to cope with the pressures of childcare and strengthen their relationship.

The pair, who married in 2006 and have two children, have urged other couples to invest time in their marriage as a preemptive measure 'before it's too late'. 

Marina, who is founder of antenatal courses The Bump Class, told The Telegraph, 'The most compatible couples will struggle when into the mix you throw an exhausted, emotionally volatile woman who is physically vulnerable after giving birth, and a new father, equally tired and overwhelmed by his new responsibility.

'Wrapped up in just getting through each day, the parents have little time left for each other, and the communication breakdown begins.'

Marina has been keen to stress the importance of communication in a successful marriage, and has said she can  see how couples can easily get so busy that they leave no time for each other.

Whilst many of her toddler-raising friends agree that marriage counselling is a good idea, Marina suggested that most couples who receive therapy make the decision too late.

Often, Marina says, this is due to a lack of time.

She added: 'We spend a day deliberating about which sofa to buy, but we can’t relinquish an hour for the sake of our marriages?'  

And the Fogles' marriage has faced more challenges than most in recent years. Last August the pair were left devastated after Marina almost died giving birth to their stillborn son.

'It was a horribly sad time,' said Ben.  

Ben has also written about the tragedy of losing his beloved Labrador Inca in 2012, the dog had been a regular companion in his life and was even a catalyst for meeting his wife. It was on his daily dog walk in Hyde Park that Ben bumped into Marina. and the 41-year-old adventurer struggled hugely after losing his 'best friend'.

The couple have also had to cope with Ben's regular trips around the world, which force them to spend long periods of time apart. He has admitted to his guilt at leaving Marina behind to look after two children and a dog.

But it was the trauma of losing their third child last year that compelled the Fogles to see a counsellor. Although the initial therapy was focused around dealing with their grief, the pair now see their counsellor regularly about their relationship. 

They rarely argue, Marina says, but when they do, they can be particularly hard to get over. The house is the thing they say they're most likely to row about - and a confrontation can often take them weeks to recover from.

Moving forward: Marina is using her experiences of motherhood in her own pregnancy clinic in South Kensington advising other mums-to-be

'I’d argue our emotional wellbeing is significantly more important than our cars, eyes or teeth,' says Marina. 'If you can learn how to be strong while the going is easy, you will be better equipped for the more challenging terrain when it comes.'

It was the difficult experience of childbirth that also prompted Marina to open her pregnancy clinic The Bump Class. 

The mother-of-two now runs her South Kensington-based clinic along with her sister, Chiara Hunt, and the pair aim to guide pregnant women through what can be a daunting time. 

The idea is that women often have very similar experiences during childbirth and they can benefit from sharing their journey with others.
