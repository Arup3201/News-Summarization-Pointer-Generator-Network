The parents of six children who died when a fire ripped through their home today pleaded not guilty to six counts of murder.

Mick Philpott, 55, and his wife Mairead, 31, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court charged with murdering Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and 13-year-old Duwayne.

The children died after the blaze engulfed their semi-detached house in Allenton, Derby, on May 11.

Mick Philpott, wearing a St 
Christopher pendant, broke down in tears and held his head in his hands as he 
entered his plea to each of the six charges.

His wife, wearing a cross on a long 
chain around her neck, was more composed as she also pleaded not guilty,
 but became tearful during the hour-long hearing.

A second man, who was charged with the six murders on Monday by Derbyshire Police, also appeared in the dock.

Grey-haired Paul Mosley, 45, of Derby, did not speak during the hearing and stared straight ahead. He did not enter a plea.

The Honourable Mrs Justice Kate Thirwall remanded the three into custody at Nottingham Crown Court.

They will next appear at Birmingham Crown Court at 2pm on November 29.
