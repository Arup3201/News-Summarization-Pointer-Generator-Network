Roy Hodgson has hit back at Brendan Rodgers' claims that he ignored advice from Liverpool over Daniel Sturridge's recovery time.

Rodgers was furious when Sturridge injured his thigh during the last England get together and he hasn't played since the 1-0 victory over Norway early last month.

The Liverpool manager insisted that Sturridge needs 48 hours to recover after a match, but Hodgson ignored the advice and forced the striker to train.

Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England in September resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland and a number of Liverpool matches

Hodgson said: 'We have only a shortage of time. We have two games and two training sessions, we wanted to play him and Rooney together against Switzerland.

'The injury was unfortunate but if I am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we won't train. They can't have two days off.

'He has not played for Liverpool since picking up the injury. If he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for Liverpool anyway. There was no question of him being selected.

Hodgson denied that there is any problem between him and Brendan Rodgers after the Liverpool manager warned him not to play Daniel Sturridge.

The England boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face San Marino and Estonia in their Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Rodgers said that he had told Hodgson that Sturridge was not available for the national team, even though he could play some part of Liverpool's match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday before the England squad meet up.

Talking at Melwood, the Liverpool boss said: 'I've not spoken to Daniel (about the situation). My focus is on Liverpool, it is not on England.

'I spoke to him about being available for Liverpool but I can't think about England when he is not ready to play for Liverpool.

England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches

'He's had a grade one injury for four weeks, which is a long time, and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool.

'I've had good communication with Roy. It was amicable. There is no issue.

'We spoke at length yesterday on the situation and I said to him 'Every individual player is different'.

'I respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with Liverpool players and what their needs are.

'We agreed it was probably too soon for Daniel to meet up with England, irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not. He hasn't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them.'

While there is no issue between himself and Hodgson, Rodgers wouldn't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads. 

'It is not something to be discussed now,' he said. 

'I don't think the same thing will happen again. From the conversations with Roy they will obviously look at that.

'I understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players, we work players here on the second day, but it needs to be tapered to the individual player.' 

Liverpool striker Sturridge has only managed to appear in half of his side's Premier League matches

Brendan Rodgers told Hodgson that Sturridge would not be available for England but could play some part in Liverpool's match against West Brom before the national team meet up

Hodgson added: 'The last thing you want is injuries in training. You feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and I can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years I have been in charge.

'I haven't been told he can't play for us. We have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves. It's never happened in my two-and-a-half years and hope it never will. The way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players.

'If he took some part at the weekend it'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery. Us going forward in December and March, a fully fit Sturridge is what I need.

'I don't seek ways in which I can assert my authority. I'm happy with the way I use my authority.'
