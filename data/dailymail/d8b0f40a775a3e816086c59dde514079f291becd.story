When a high school senior made a wager with the Sacremanto King's Nik Staukas, the NBA rookie thought his end of the bet was safe.

Jamie Guerra from Woodhaven High School in Detroit asked how many retweets it would take for player to agree his girlfriend, Taylor Anderson,  could be his prom date.

Not expecting he would get anywhere near the target, Stauskas and Anderson agreed 10,000, but a short time later the pair were forced to concede defeat after Guerra flew past the figure.

Bad deal: NBA rookie Nik Staukas, pictured with his girlfriend Taylor Anderson, bet a high school student he could take her to his prom if he reached 10,000 likes. He conceded defeat just three hours later

Dealbreaker: When she heard about the proposal Miss Anderson sent Guerra a message wishing him good luck, unsure of what her boyfriend had got her in to

The 6ft 6in Canadian had given Guerra till midnight on Friday to reach the target, but after just three hours he was forced to say: 'Damn... Looks like we are going to prom again,' including Miss Anderson in the Tweet. 

He then sent Guerra a private message saying: 'Congrats bro. You got it! When's prom? I'm gonna come as well and ay what's up to you guys.' 

During the back and forth, Miss Anderson asked: 'What did Nik get me in to?' Then she shared her concern after other NBA player and professional athletes started sharing the student's tweet.

Arizona Cardinal Bradley Sowell was one of those who helped the student get to his target.

Miss Anderson then asked Guerra to give her an impressive 'promposal' to seal the deal.

On Friday however, she posted: 'Let's be real... Everyone wants to see Nik more than me anyways.'

Then, hours later, she uploaded the message: 'Done with Twitter for awhile. Can't can't take all these notifications anymore.' 

Guerra's story quickly spread on the internet and the news channels. It even featured on ESPN.

Presenter Bomani Jones branded the Kings player 'crazy' for agreeing to the date.  

Conversation: The high school student and professional set up the deal with Miss Anderson setting the figure to beat  

Th tweet: Guerra pleaded to followers to help him out. Within three hours he had smashed his target 

Stunned: Miss Anderson then asked Guerra to give her an impressive 'promposal' to complete the deal

Sealed the deal: After he reached the feat, Stauskas direct messaged Guerra to congratulate him and ask for some details of the event

Bombardment: After a hoard of notifications, Miss Anderson posted on Friday that she had decided to stay away from Twitter for a while
