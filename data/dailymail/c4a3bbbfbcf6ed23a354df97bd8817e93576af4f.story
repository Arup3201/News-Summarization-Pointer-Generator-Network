Most men who propose to their partner need only wait for a year or so preparing for the wedding before saying 'I do'.

But patient Alan Crotty will finally wed his lifelong sweetheart tomorrow - 46 years after first proposing.

The devoted pensioner was just 21 when he popped the question to Cathy Roberts on her 18th birthday on November 1 1968.

Having been separated for 37 years following the end of their first engagement, the pair will finally marry tomorrow

Alan Crotty, pictured here with Cathy in 1968, was just 19 when he popped the question to Cathy on her 18th birthday. He was left heartbroken when their engagement ended two years later

He was left heartbroken when their engagement ended two years later and Cathy, 63, married someone else and moved away.

Alan, 66, has remained single for his entire life and said Cathy - whose 1973 marriage ended after 10 years - was always the woman for him.

A mutual friend reintroduced them in 2007 after 37 years apart and their love was instantly rekindled.

Though Cathy married and divorced in their years apart, Alan remained single

Alan waited another four years before proposing to Cathy for a second time - at the same spot in London’s Sloane Square where he made his original request in 1968.

To his delight Cathy said ‘Yes’ and they will tie the knot in Tenterden, Kent where they now live together.

Alan, who was a railway photographer, said: 'Although we broke up Cathy was always the one for me. She had never left my mind - no one else would do.

'A friend got us back together by surprise at his home and I didn’t realise she was going to be there.

'I opened the front door, saw her and just said: ‘Hello, Cathy, do you want a cup of tea?’

'I recognised her straight away despite the gap.

'We then went back to Sloane Square in 2011 and I proposed again.

'I didn’t have to buy another engagement ring as Cathy is using her grandmother’s one - but I still have the ring she gave me in 1968.'

Cathy, a former bank worker, said: 'We saw each other for the first time after 37 years. It was as if I had seen him just two days before, as if the time had never passed.

'There was no awkwardness, no difficulty, nothing. We just picked up where we left off.

'Neither of us could remember what had happened or what had gone wrong and we couldn’t find anybody who could remember.

'I think we were always meant to be together, but he needed to develop his career, he did all the things he wanted to do.'
