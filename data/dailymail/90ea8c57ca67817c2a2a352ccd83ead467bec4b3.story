A three-year-old girl whose home was broken into while she slept upstairs has drawn a picture of a burglar to help police hunt him down.

Detectives told little Evelyn Bardgett, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, her sketch 'would make a good e-fit' as they took statements from parents Stephen, 36 and Lucy, 31.

Cruel burglars used a spade from the garden shed to force open a kitchen window and get inside the home. They stole an iPad and Mr Bardgett's wallet.

And police confirmed the raid was one of five homes in. targeted by the same gang overnight between Monday and Tuesday in the past week.

Mr Bardgett, a self-employed floor layer, said: 'The worst thing is knowing that someone has been in your house and searching around while you were asleep upstairs.

'That feeling of intrusion is horrible.

'It is not so much what has gone but more knowing that people have been creeping around your house.

'We have just finished decorating the kitchen and I know I had left the stepladder up against the wall and when I got downstairs, it was on the floor.

'I saw that the window was open, which is when I knew we had been burgled.

'Lucy and Evelyn came downstairs and we phoned the police.

'They were here for at least two hours and scenes-of-crime officers and CID came too.

'Evelyn drew them a picture of a burglar and one of the detectives said to her, 'that's a good e-fit, hopefully we can catch them from that'.'

Derbyshire Police said cash, jewellery, laptops and mountain bikes were stolen from other properties in the same area in the spate of burglaries between Monday night and Tuesday morning.

A force spokesman said: 'We believe all five burglaries are linked and we would like to hear from anyone who might have been offered the items for sale or know who is responsible.'
