A toddler pulled a bag of cocaine  out of a woman's shirt during traffic stop. 

Deputies say an 11-month-old boy pulled a baggie full of cocaine from inside the shirt of Candyce Harden, during a traffic stop near Daytona Beach.

Volusia County Sheriff's deputies stopped a car Sunday for traffic violations.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports a K-9 unit arrived to check the car.

Deputies asked the occupants to step outside  - in the back seat was Crystal Matthews and an 11-month boy, investigators said.

No drugs were found inside the car, but as the deputy handed a driver's license the baby reached inside her shirt and pulled out the baggie.

It is unclear who the baby belongs to.

An arrest report says deputies found three more baggies and pills without a prescription.

Harden faces multiple charges including child abuse and possession of drugs.

Deputies checked Matthews and discovered she was on 'Florida Inmate Release status' for the sale/manufacture/or delivery of cocaine, reports said. 

It's not known whether Hardem hired a lawyer.

Harden was released after posting $4,500 bail, court records show.
