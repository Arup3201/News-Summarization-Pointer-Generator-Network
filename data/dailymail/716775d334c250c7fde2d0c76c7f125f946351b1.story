Talk about bad timing. 

On the same day Secretary of State John Kerry held up a new United Nations climate change report as evidence of global warming, a record-breaking storm hit his home state of Massachusetts, which he was visiting that day for a funeral and a football game.

The local temperature fell to 36 degrees that morning and snow and wind blasted the state.

'The bottom line is that our planet is warming due to human actions, the damage is already visible, and the challenge requires ambitious, decisive and immediate action,' Kerry said in a statement on Sunday responding to  the release of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change review.

As the statement was released, temperatures were dropping in New England and snow began to blanket the north east, leading to the most snow fall on record for Nov. 2 in the Bay State in 120 years. 

Later in the day the snow dissipated and just rain and sleet came down throughout the afternoon, the Boston Globe reports. 

Still, enough snow fell that the field of the New England Patriots had to be cleaned off ahead of their early evening football game, which Kerry attended with Patriots owner Robert Kraft and watched from a cozy seat in Kraft's indoor box, as CNS News pointed out.

Outdoors, average Patriots fans braved the 40 degree weather and 13 mile an hour winds that made the temperature feel like a chilly 32 degrees Fahrenheit to see their team play. Temperatures crept back up into the low 50s today today, Weather Channel data shows.

The UN's latest climate change report follows claims by Weather Channel founder John Coleman that man-made global warming is not real.

In an open letter last week to the Intergovernmental Panel, Coleman said, 'I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid.'

Warming has not occurred for a decade and a half, Coleman said. 'There is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future.'

The Weather Channel immediately disavowed Coleman and trumpeted its own views that 'strong evidence' points to an increase in temperatures globally as the result of human activity.

'The science is really clear, and I don't like our brand being associated with something that's not scientifically based,' Weather Channel CEO David Kenny told CNN.

Besides, Kenny said, Coleman hasn't been affiliated with the organization he founded for thirty years.

Secretary of State Kerry was in his home state on Sunday to attend the funeral of former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. A record-breaking snow storm hit Massachusetts that day just as Kerry released a statement sounding the alarm on global warming

On Sunday Coleman assailed Kenny on CNN and pointed out that unlike the current CEO of his former company he is a scientist who bases his arguments on fact.

He also pooh poohed Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter, whose show he appeared on, for labeling him a climate 'denier' when he is merely a 'skeptic.'

'CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming,' he said, and claims 'that it is a consensus.'

'Well there is no consensus in science. Science isn’t a vote. Science is about facts,' he told Stelter.

Coleman lamented the fact that climate change had become politicized and a major part of the Democratic Party's platform. 

'But he science is on my side,' he said, triumphantly.

He later told CNN viewers, ‘Hello, everybody! There is no global warming!'

Democrat Kerry said on Sunday that not only is the climate warming, the world is on its way to 'a large scale disaster.'

'The longer we are stuck in a debate over ideology and politics, the more the costs of inaction grow and grow,' the Obama official said in an official government statement. 

'Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids,' he continued. 

The UN report warned 'the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.'

'It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions,' it went on to say.

Kerry, who has equated the importance of acting to slow down global climate change with the necessity of ending terrorism, proclaimed on Sunday that 'greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are higher than ever, and we're seeing more and more extreme weather and climate events.'

That includes storms, heat waves and downpours, he said. And 'it's not a coincidence.' 

'With this report, we have yet another round of authoritative, peer-reviewed science to prove it,' he asserted.
