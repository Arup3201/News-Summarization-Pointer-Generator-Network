Most babies' faces light up the moment they see their parents looking at them.

But for one mother, the reaction she got when her daughter recognised her face for the first time was one she will never forget.

Baby Louise was born with albinism, a condition which affects the amount of melanin in the skin and can also impair vision.

Baby Louise, pictured, was born with albinism, a condition which had impaired her vision, and she needed to have glasses fitted 

This means that she had been unable to see her mother's face clearly and needed glasses to correct her eyesight.

And the heartwarming moment the baby was fitted with her first pair of specs, she was able to see clearly for the first time and looked on in amazement at recognising her mother's face.

The fitting was captured on camera and shows Louise's glasses being fitted and adjusted around her face.

Her mother then calls her name and claps her hands, and the youngster looks around to see what all of the fuss is about.

At first Louise didn't look impressed with her new specs, but after hearing her mother call her name and clap she became excited 

Then a big smile breaks out across her face after she recognises her mother and can clearly see her face for the first time ever 

But on realising that it is her mother and she can see her face properly for the first time, Louise looks on in shock and a big smile breaks out across her face.

The clip, which has already been viewed almost 700,000 times in six days, came with the caption: 'Our sweet Louise who has Albinism, received her glasses!

'This is her reaction from putting them on for the first time. It seems like she is really 'seeing' her mommy for the first time. Love!'

Albinism is a genetic condition, which affects the production of melanin affecting the skin, hair and eyes.

The lack of pigment in the iris causes sufferers to often have red or grey coloured eyes, but also affects the retina leading to vision problems.

It is thought that the condition affects 1 in 17,000 people in the US.
