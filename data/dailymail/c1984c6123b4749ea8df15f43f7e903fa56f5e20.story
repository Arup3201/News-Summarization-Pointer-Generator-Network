To say that today's Cricket World Cup Final is the one everyone from this side of the globe had hoped for is an understatement, but it is also will be between the tournament's two best teams.

A World Cup record attendance of 95,000 people will fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in a decider that, one way or another, will be a memorable one.

Thousands of fans dressed in their team's colours and waving flags thronged the streets all around the MCG.

Australia seems to have the upper hand in the tournament decider, with New Zealand all-out for 183 after 45 overs.

However, Australia's chase got off to a rocky start, with opener Aaron Finch out for a duck.

Australian wicket-keeper came under social media fire for his exuberant send off of Martin Guptill in the World Cup final. 

After the Kiwi was bowled by Glenn Maxwell, Haddin made no effort to hide his joy in reminding the batsman his work for the day was done.

Former England bowler Alex Tudor was one of many who reacted to the incident online, and called Haddin a 'muppet'.

Haddin also clashed with Grant Elliott, who successfully appealed against an LBW decision. 

The banter was bound to be good-natured as normal between the two sets of supporters - though exactly how good-natured it was after New Zealand's captain and star batsman Brendan McCullum was bowled for nought is questionable.

Apart from the obvious reasons, both teams were added inspiration to win before the game.

For Australia, Michael Clarke's announcement that he will retire after Sunday's match will ensure his team-mates will want to see him go out on a high.

While New Zealand’s former captain Martin Crowe, who is terminally ill with lymphoma, has penned a moving tribute to his countrymen ahead of the big encounter.

In a column published on Cricinfo, the 52-year-old said Sunday’s match at the MCG might be the last he ever sees.

‘My precarious life ahead may not afford me the luxury of many more games to watch and enjoy,’ Crowe wrote.

‘So this is likely to be it. The last, maybe, and I can happily live with that.’

New Zealand have a 100% record in the tournament having played all their games at home, so this was going to be their biggest test of the competition at the MCG. 

After the shock loss of McCullum the Black Caps they were able to steady the ship getting to 132 for three after 30 overs, with batsman Grant Elliot hitting another 50 not out and looking comfortable.

The BBC's statistics department made the point that Elliott is the fifth man to score half-centuries both in a World Cup semi-final and final. England's Mike Brearley did it in 1979, Australia's David Boon in 1987, Javed Miandad in 1992 for India and Sri Lanka's Aravinda de Silva in 1996
