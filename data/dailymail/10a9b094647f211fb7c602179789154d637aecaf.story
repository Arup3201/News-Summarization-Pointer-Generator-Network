For several generations board game fans have searched for clues to crack the classic whodunnit.

Was it Reverend Green in the library with the revolver or Miss Scarlet in the billiard room with the candlestick?

But makers of the much-loved board game Cluedo are to give the format a new lease of life with a modern twist - just in time for Christmas.

Modern: The classic board game Cluedo has been given a makeover with new characters and a London edition to be launched today

New: Instead of the traditional characters, including the likes of Mrs White and Miss Scarlet, the new version will feature a socialite, the mayor and a footballer

The game has been given a 21st century makeover with a whole new cast of characters replacing the classic figures players have come to know and love, with a footballer, journalist and socialite stepping in for the likes of Mrs White and Professor Plum.

And London will become the setting for the first ever regionalised version of the parlour game with versions set in Birmingham, Cardiff and Edingburgh and elsewhere also set to hit the market next year.

Inventor: Anthony E Pratt, a solicitors clerk from Birmingham, patented the originally Cluedo concept in 1944

It will feature Malcolm Mustard the Mayor, Gus green the footballer, Paul Plum the journalist, Penelope Peacock the socialite and Winnie White the therapist.

Instead of the murder taking place in the study, kitchen, dining room, bathroom, garage, living room or games room, the scene of the crime will now either be St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Covent Garden, Heathrow, Wembley, the Houses of Parliament, Knightsbridge, Canary Wharf and Soho.

One thing that will not change in the new version however, is the customary list of possible murder weapons - the candlestick, dagger, lead piping, revolver, rope and wrench.

There are 324 potential murder combinations in the new game, with the victim - a high profile Media Mogul - always staying the same.

And it includes portraits of each 
character, with the Mayor, who lives in Westminster, described as 'loved
by the people' with 'an abundance of charisma'.

But
in London Cluedo, suspicion is rife as rumours spread about the board’s
Media Mogul turning on the Mayor and exposing him so he will ditch his 
ambitious plans to climb politics ‘greasy pole’.

And
all the other shady characters are under suspicion too, with the 
Camden-based Therapist’s motive for murder stemming from a move she made
on the Media Mogul, who has been using her couch in an unorthodox way.

London-based
games maker Winning Moves UK is launching the game today at College 
Green, Westminster, with the help of a Boris Johnson look-alike on a 
Boris Bike armed with a giant candlestick.

Suspect: The new version features the likes of footballer Gus Green who is described as 'consumed by greed'

Familiar: The blond mayor is described as having 'an abundance of charisma'

The new game features new suspects

New landmark murder scenes replace the old rooms

The game still features the same selection of weapons

Camden therapist Winnie White is one of the new characters

Journalist Paul Plum is 'always looking for the next scoop'

Sally Scarlett is a talent show winner 'clinging to stardom'

Traditional: The original Cluedo game as released by Waddingtons

An oversized 5ft by 5ft replica of the game will also be on show, and people around the capital will be treated to Cluedo street art complete with a silhouette game and the words ‘Was it the Mayor’ outside tube stations and popular tourist destinations.

‘Detectives’ have been handing out Top Secret tips as to ‘Whodunnit’ across London this morning, telling the public to meet at Westminster at 1pm to solve the case.

Winning Moves UK Chairman Tom Liddell said: 'The public has been asking us for some time to do regionalised CLUEDO. And with the 2012 buzz around London, we are now delighted to oblige. 

'We have very exciting plans to roll out other regional CLUEDO’s across the UK and Ireland too.'

The board game Cluedo was first patented by Birmingham solicitor's clerk Anthony E Pratt back in 1944 and was originally called 'Murder!' and designed to provide entertainment in shelters during lengthy air raids.

But the game wasn't released until 1949 after it was picked up by Waddingtons who renamed it Cluedo - a play on the word 'clue' and 'ludo' which is Latin for 'I play'.

It was released at around the same time in the US and renamed Clue.

Unlike the version that board game fans came to know and love, Pratt's original concept featured 10 characters, including names such as Mr Gold and Mr Brown, one of whom would be designated as the murder victim by random drawing at the beginning of each game.

It also featured a range of nine weapons, with murders committed using an axe, bomb, poison or even a fireplace poker.

There has been three editions released in the UK over the years, with the longest lasting 47 years following the game's release.

The latest edition was released back in 2002/2003.

As well as providing hours of fun as a board game, Cluedo has also been the inspiration for a number of spin off products, the 1985 cult classic film Clue starring Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd, a Broadway musical, a play and various game shows.
