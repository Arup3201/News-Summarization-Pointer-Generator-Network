Banned: Kieran Stott has been handed an ASBO banning him from stepping foot in Birkenhead town centre, unless he is with his mother

He may not be the most menacing person to look at, but this 16-year-old boy has been banned from an entire town centre unless he is there with his mother.

Kieran Stott led a 30-strong group of yobs on a rampage who terrorised shoppers by throwing fireworks at cars and hurling abuse, leaving one street in Birkenhead looking like a 'New York ghetto'.

In
 one incident witnesses said Stott was seen 'enjoying the chaos' after a
 fire hydrant was set off.

Staff and 
customers in shops, particularly McDonald's and Bargain Booze were said
 to have been left alarmed by his behaviour.

On his Facebook he can be 
seen holding a baton whilst young pals brandished a toy dagger and a 
gold knuckleduster.

One 
posting showed a picture of a police van with 
the caption: 'Hate the police they take the job to hart (sic).'

He also called himself a member of the self styled 'Birkenhead Boyz'.

Wirral Magistrates' Court heard the teenager was involved in at least 36 incidents, including intimidating and harrassing people and causing criminal damage.

Details
 of Stott's campaign of misery emerged when magistrates ordered he be named and shamed and issued with an ASBO banning 
him from parts of Birkenhead - unless he is with his mother.

He is also banned from meeting several friends in public.

Speaking after the hearing Stott said: 'I have done some of it and I have admitted it.

'I haven’t been smashing windows or putting fireworks through letterboxes or intimidating people with knives.

'It’s stupid. It’s making me feel horrible (that mum’s getting upset). My face is all over the paper and I feel ashamed. I’m not going back to college, my face is all over the papers, I’m embarrassed.'

His mother Tracie Stott admitted her son is 'no angel' but added 'he is not what they are making him out to be'.

Gang leader: Looking as though butter wouldn't melt, a younger Kieran Stott is picutred in his school uniform. The teenager was said to be the leader of a 30-strong gang of yobs who terrorised shoppers in Birkenhead

She said: 'He is no angel by any means, if he has done something wrong yes he should get punished for it.

'He is being made out to be the ringleader. He is admitting doing things, some of it. He has been in the group messing about at McDonalds.

'He is not out of control in the house. I suppose he can do a bit of showing off.

'In my eyes I have done the best that I can. I come from a good family. I ground him. I take his phone and xbox from him and stop his money. That’s for everything. He has been punished and then they have the cheek to do this.

'He is totally gobsmacked, I think he is in shock. At college they all say what a nice lad he is but he can have his moments.

'He is easily influenced but he is far from a ringleader. Even when he is not there it is still happening. I haven’t seen any weapons.'

Ali
 Bayatti, prosecuting on behalf of Wirral council, handed the court a 
dosssier of evidence detailing 'a series of at least 36 specific 
incidents of anti-social behaviour in which the youngster was involved 
in'.

Yobs: Wirral Magistrates' Court heard Stott was part of a group who was seen throwing fireworks at cars and hurling abuse at passers-by who dared to intervene

He said the authority believed Stott was the leader of the gang - which numbered up to 30 at times.

Mr
 Bayatti said: 'The behaviour details incidents of verbal abuse, 
intimidating behaviour, causing criminal damage, throwing things and 
harassing people passing by.'

Stott
 was said to be among people repeatedly causing trouble and alarming 
staff and customers in shops, particularly McDonalds and Bargain Booze.

He
 was also identified as being part of a group whose members had been 
seen throwing fireworks at cars and shops, though he was not listed as 
having thrown any himself, and shouting abuse at people in the streets.

Last
 July he was found 'enjoying the chaos' after a fire hydrant was set off
 in a scene described in court as making the road 'look like a New York 
ghetto'.

Mr Bayatti added: 
'In relation to this defendant we classed the behaviour so severe that 
it necessitated an application for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order.'

Defending Stott, Matt Harvey disputed that his client was a leader of the gang and added that he had no previous convictions.

Menace: Magistrates were handed a dossier of 36 offences Stott, pictured here with friends, was involved with. Magistrates banned the teen from meeting with friends in public under the terms of his ASBO

But
 chairman of the bench Phil Rowlands approved the ASBO, which bans Stott
 from entering parts of Birkenhead including sections of Grange Road and
 Grange Road West unless he is with his mum or on public transport.

He
 is also banned from associating with eight individuals in any public 
place in Wirral unless he is invited to attend by the council or police.

A
 reporting restriction banning the publication of Stott's identity was 
lifted by magistrates 'due to the nature of the offences and to reassure victims
 that action was being taken to protect them'.

Restriction lifted: A reporting restriction in place to stop Stott being identified was lifted by Wirral Magistrates' Court, pictured, allowing the teenager to be named and shamed and to reassure victims that action was being taken

Stott will be subject to the ASBO for three years.

Mohammed Rizhi, a local shopkeeper said: 'He (Stott) used to come and stand in front of the shop with all the others. He would send people in and they would steal ice creams.

'He is not a good guy he used to drink as well. I had to ban him from the shop about three or four months ago.

'He is very abusive. He used to taunt me from the window eyeballing me. I’ve seen them play with the football, kicking it against the window.'

Labour
 Councillor George Davies, Wirral's cabinet member for neighbourhoods, 
housing and engagement, welcomed the ASBO, applied for after work by the
 council, police and family housing associations.

He
 said: 'I hope this successful court action sends the message loud and 
clear that such alarming and distressing anti-social behaviour will not 
be tolerated in Wirral.'
