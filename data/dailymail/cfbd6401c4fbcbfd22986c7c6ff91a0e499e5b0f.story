The way is now clear for Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to be promoted to executive chairman following the removal of one potential source of embarrassment.

His former temporary personal assistant Rani Abraham made a claim last June of sex discrimination and harassment after she caused a furore by leaking a sexist email exchange between Scudamore and TV rights lawyer Nick West. But Abraham, 41, now wants to move on, according to a friend, and a planned employment tribunal case will not go ahead.

Scudamore is expected to have his elevation rubber-stamped at the Premier League summit a week on Thursday, especially as the clubs are flush with the proceeds of the £5billion domestic TV rights deal orchestrated by Scudamore and have more billions to come from the overseas market.

The appointment of an executive chairman will need a statute change and to ensure there is some counterbalance to Scudamore getting everything his own way, it’s likely the Premier League will also appoint two new independent directors.

Brian Cookson, president of world cycling’s UCI, is taking the lead in testing men and women competing in the same race after IOC president Thomas Bach promoted the idea for future Olympic Games. 

The UCI are putting on a trial involving British Under 23 riders at their Aigle HQ in Switzerland on Friday, when they will experiment with sprints and other races. Data from sports scientists show men are 10 to 15 per cent stronger and fitter than women cyclists.

World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper feels no need to apologise for his pro-England tweet that upset sensitive fans of pool rivals Wales. After seeing Eoin Morgan’s cricketers fail to get out of their World Cup group, the 55-year-old Aussie posted: ‘England fail to exit pool in World Cup... Not the words we want to hear during #RWC2015.’ 

Speaking at the Sport Industry Breakfast on Tuesday, Gosper said every event organiser wants the host nation to do well, but is confident of England hosting the most successful ever global rugby tournament whatever the fate of Stuart Lancaster’s team.

Drawing pools for the Rugby World Cup three years before the kick-off led to the farce of Wales, who had briefly slipped out of the world’s top eight, being in the same group as England and Australia when the three are currently ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. That is going to change for Japan 2019, with the draw moving back by at least a year. World Rugby chief Brett Gosper would also like bidding contracts for the 2023 World Cup to forbid the online secondary sale of tickets.

Land Rover, whose serious upset over the way England rugby players behaved on an infamous sponsors day during the 2011 World Cup resulted in them not renewing their RFU official vehicle sponsorship, are nevertheless still sufficiently engaged with the sport to be backing ITV’s coverage of this year’s tournament.

Seven players involved in driving Land Rovers that day are either still in or on the fringes of Stuart Lancaster’s squad. One player wrote in the leaked RFU World Cup report: ‘It was four hours of being stuck in a car driving slowly to satisfy following TV cameras — there were even TV cameras filming from helicopters. There was no fishing, no surfing, no BBQ and more importantly no R and R.’

Another player added: ‘We were told we weren’t allowed to do any commercial stuff during the World Cup but here they (Land Rover) were exploiting us on our day off to promote their brand.’

The speedy turnover in the international cricket calendar that sees England’s Test squad named on Wednesday after Tuesday’s debrief of the World Cup shambles is very fortunate for head coach Peter Moores and managing director Paul Downton. It allows them to move quickly on to the West Indies tour when a more lengthy analysis of England’s dismal failure to get out of their group at the World Cup after six months of uninterrupted one-day cricket would surely have resulted in both men being axed.
