A young Virginia man who, as a juvenile, was given six life sentences plus 118 years in prison for an armed robbery in which no one was hurt is asking for a conditional pardon from outgoing Governor Bob McDonnell.

Travion Blount's lawyers claim he should serve no more than 20 years for his part in the September 2006 robbery, which he carried out as a 15-year-old with two 18-year-olds who received 10-year and 13-year sentences in plea deals.

Blount, who is now 23, refused a plea agreement and was found guilty by a Norfolk jury. A Circuit Court judge then handed down what many believe is the longest sentence in the country given to a teenage offender for a crime that wasn't murder.

Unfair sentence: Travion Blount, pictured, was given six life sentences plus 118 years in prison in 2007 for an armed robbery in which no one was hurt, is asking for a conditional pardon from outgoing Governor Bob McDonnell

He has been in Wallens Ridge State Prison, a maximum-security facility in Big Stone Gap, since 2007.

According to The Virginia Pilot, the teens raided a house party, stealing cellphones, a small amount of cash and marijuana, records show. No shots were fired and Blount injured no one. The three were quickly caught and charged by police.Â 

'There is no arguing that the crime committed was trivial,' the man's appeal for a conditional pardon reads, adding that the teen was 'naive and unduly influenced' by the much older boys.

'What is arguable is the fact that, out of three individuals who committed the crime, only one person will die in prison.'

Pardons are often granted at the end of elected terms and McDonnell leaves office January 11. Such pardons grant early release with conditions for keeping on good behavior.

Blount's clemency appeal states that he will abide by any conditions the Governor sees fit.

The petition also lists Blount's criminal history - he was convicted for unauthorized use of a vehicle, robbery, attempted robbery and malicious wounding in four separate incidents.

A Change.org online petition has been set up on Blount's behalf to lobby state officials for a new sentence.

Monique Santiago, an accountant from Hampton, read about Blount's case and thought the punishment was excessive.

Longest sentence: Blount, who is now 23, refused a plea agreement and was found guilty by a Norfolk jury. A Circuit Court judge then handed down what many believe is the longest sentence in the country given to a teenage offender for a crime that wasn't murder

'It just blew my mind,' Santiago told The Pilot. 'He should be punished, but to this extreme? No.'

The state has refused a new sentence for the young man after appeals in state and federal courts.

The federal appeal remains active in the U.S. District Court in Norfolk.

His layer John Coggeshall said publicity has helped the case.

'It's time to bring this into the political arena as well as the legal arena,' he told The Pilot.

Virginia is one of a few states where a judge can sentence a juvenile to life without parole for crimes such as rape, abduction and robbery.

A spokesperson for McDonnell said the governor was aware of the case and the request was 'working its way through the normal process.'
