Proud parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared details on their son Prince George as they enjoyed their first night out without him yesterday evening.

The royal couple were guests of honour at the inaugural Tusk Trust awards, held at the Royal Society in central London.

When asked who George took after by Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba, Kate replied: 'Like most babies, he's got a mix of both of us.'

Her husband Prince William later joked about how loud the seven-week-old can cry as he gave a speech to guests at the event.

He said: 'As
you might have gathered, Catherine and I have recently become proud 
parents - of a baby who has a voice to match any lion's roar.'

He then went on to apologise in advance for either of them appearing distracted during the evening.

'This is actually our first evening out 
without him, so please excuse us if you see us nervously casting cheeky 
glances at our mobile phones to check all is well back home,' he explained.   

They had left Prince George with William's former nanny, Jessie Webb, 71, who the Duke persuaded to come out of retirement to help them part-time.

Kate had pulled out all the stops to ensure she looked as glamorous as ever, wearing a dazzling sequin Jenny Packham dress with Jimmy Choo heels.

The Cambridges' evening out came 
after William announced that he had given up his operational career in 
the military and was now considering options for future 'public 
service'.

He is royal patron of the UK-based African wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust, which staged last night's awards ceremony.

He told guests how the cause is even more important to him now he has become a parent.

He said: 'Like any new parents, our thoughts inevitably turn to the world that our child will inherit. It is unfathomable to imagine a world in which children who have been born in the past couple of months may grow up in a world in which rhinoceros have ceased to exist in the wild.He added: 'The possibility of extinction is bad enough for one of our children growing up here in the West, who will never experience the magic of seeing a rhino on a new television documentary; or even for my own little George, who Catherine and I very much hope to introduce to east Africa - a place we know and love - in the fullness of time.

Proud uncle: Prince Harry revealed that his nephew has smiled at him as he met children at the WellChild Awards this week

'But for a child growing up in Africa and whose birthright and economic inheritance these creatures are, it is nothing more than immoral that he or she may never experience what his parents and grandparents knew and treasured.'

Earlier this week, Prince Harry also talked proudly about his nephew as he attended the WellChild Awards. He revealed he had spent some time with the new member of the family at Kensington Palace before attending the event.

'Normally when I see him he's either sleeping or crying but I've just seen him smile. It was the first time I've seen him smile,' he said.

When asked what kind of life his royal nephew could look forward to when one child, six, questioned: 'What's it like to be a Prince?'

Harry replied diplomatically: 'Good and bad.'
