This was the biggest night of Harry Kane’s extraordinary breakthrough season, so how did the England striker cope with the famed Italian brand of defending on his full debut? 

ALL SYSTEMS GO

Credit to Roy Hodgson for abandoning his original system in the 54th minute. It simply wasn’t working with Theo Walcott up front with Harry Kane.

Ross Barkley replaced him and Wayne Rooney, a peripheral first half figure, was promoted up front to partner Kane.

That bold and decisive move gave this more physical duo far more presence in their battle with Italy’s three-man defensive shield.

‘We struggled physically in the second half,’ admitted Italy coach Antonio Conte. He was right.

Kane had a couple of decent chances, one deflected away for a corner and another saved well by Gianluigi Buffon when he fed off the scraps from Andros Townsend’s shots.

The beauty of this boy Kane is that he shows no fear, standing tall with the rest of this England team as they fought their way back into this game.

At the final whistle, Buffon embraced the Tottenham striker before he walked towards the England fans to salute them for travelling to Turin for this friendy. He belongs in this company.

ITALIAN MARKING

Prince Harry had Leonardo Bonucci marking him throughout the first half and he was so tight to the England forward it was skin-on-skin at times.

Bonucci, along with his central defensive partner Giorgio Chiellini is part of a Juventus team who are top of Serie A and have only conceded 14 goals in the league. You don’t get much change out of these two, especially at international level.

It is almost a criminal act for an Italian defender to concede a goal, no matter what the circumstances or the occasion.

Antonio Conte’s team spend hours on the practice pitches going through defensive drills, denying opposition players space in the areas where they can be hurt the most.

Rooney had warned this England team about the dirty tricks, but Italy have turned defending in to an art form over the years. They are masters of their trade.

This is part of Kane’s education, working out ways to unsettle Italy’s three man defence and pulling at least one of them out of position to open up some space in central areas.

STARVED OF SERVICE

Kane's biggest contribution to the first half was his knock-down for Walcott’s effort that rebounded to Wayne Rooney lurking just inside the penalty area. England’s captain hit the bar.

That was better, getting the ball in to dangerous areas of the field for Kane to finally do some damage. Still, it was hard to get away from the statistics.

By the time the England team walked off the pitch at half-time in the Juventus Stadium, when they were losing 1-0, Kane had only touched the ball 15 times, Theo Walcott had 13. That is not nearly enough at this level.

The alternative is to stay on the last man, as he did after the break by treading on the toes of Chiellini, his designated second half marker, and acting as a target man. The change gave England options and Kane’s effort at the start of the second half would have troubled Italy’s legendary keeper Gianluigi Buffon, but it was deflected wide for a corner.

THAT WAS THE WEEK

This time last year Harry Kane had scored just two goals in his entire career for Spurs: one against Shamrock Rovers in the Europa League and another against Hull City in the Capital One Cup.

This has been a momentous week in Harry Kane’s life and he returns to Tottenham’ s training ground to prepare for Sunday’s clash with Burnley as a full international.

After scoring 29 times for Tottenham this season, plus another on his debut for the national team against Lithuania at Wembley last Friday, he remains very much man of the moment.

Even at 21 he looks like a man who can take it all in his stride and there is even the possibility that he will be named PFA player of the year or FWA footballer of the year in May.

UNDER 21 DILEMMA

Gareth Southgate will hold more talks with the Tottenham forward, but there is pressure from within Wembley for Kane to commit to the Under 21 tournament this summer.

Kane has represented England at various levels throughout his international career and it will send a strong message to players that they are expected to play in summer tournaments.

The Spurs forward has played an awful lot of football this season, but there is a real momentum building with the Under 21 team after their fine comeback and eventual victory over Germany at the Riverside on Monday evening.

With Kane in the Under 21s this summer, along with West Brom forward Saido Berahino, England would have one of the most potent attacking partnerships at the tournament.
