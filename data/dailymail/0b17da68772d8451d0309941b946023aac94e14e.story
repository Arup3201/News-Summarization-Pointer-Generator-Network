Ukraine's embattled president has included the left foot of England star John Terry in a bizarre list of reasons why his country is facing a political crisis, it emerged today.

Viktor Yanukovych said the Chelsea defender's controversial clearance that led to a 'goal' being disallowed in Euro 2012 is one reason why he resents the EU.

The hardline leader also cited the moment as one reason why he continues to resist the demands of millions of protesters on the streets of Kiev calling for faster integration with Europe.

Controversial: John Terry clears an effort from  Marko Devic of Ukraine off the line during the Euro 2012 group D match between England and Ukraine at Donbass Arena on June 19, 2012

Terry cleared the ball during a group match between England and Ukraine in July 2012, which England won 1-0, thereby knocking the hosts out of the tournament.

The ball looked like it had crossed the line - although the Ukrainian striker had appeared to be offside anyway - but the referee did not award the goal.

According to the Daily Telegraph, the president delivered a 70-minute rant to U.S. senators John McCain and Chris Murphy before Christmas during which he made the connection.

Describing the rant, Connecticut senator Chris Murphy wrote: 'He opens by restating his commitment 
to joining the EU, but spends most of the speech listing the slight he 
feels Europe has lodged against him and his country.

'At
 one point he spends more than a few minutes talking about a disallowed 
goal by Ukraine in a 2012 Euro Cup match against England.'

Many Ukrainians felt they had been humiliated when their side crashed out of the first ever tournament the country had hosted.

Ukraine, the largest country in eastern Europe with a population of 46 million, has witnessed repeated scenes of unrest in 2012 with Yanukovych being 
accused of obeying a strong-arm demand by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin 
and vetoing a pact for closer ties with the EU.

Many pro-Westerners see the move as a step back to Ukraine's bleak Soviet past preventing it one day joining the European Union.
