She had just landed a Best Actress Oscar her performance in Still Alice.

And the first person Julianne Moore wanted to see was a 50-year-old former nurse in Minnesota.

Mother-of-two Sandy Oltz was the inspiration for the role which tells the story of a high-flying woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's at just 50 years old. 

As soon as she finished partying, Moore sent a text that Oltz shared exclusively with Daily Mail Online, which said: 'Thank you thank you very very much for EVERYTHING. Love you so much. Julie.'

The pair met for the first time over Skype a year and a half ago. They are now close friends, and Oltz even celebrated her 50th birthday on set.

Oltz, of Sartell, Minnesota, told Daily Mail Online: 'I screamed so much when Julie won the Oscar, I woke up my sons, my husband and my dog.

'I was sat on the sofa in my jammies so nervous for her. When it came to the Best Actress award I got up so I was inches away from the screen.

'They called her name and I was jumping around like a fool.'

It was the culmination of months tirelessly juggling her own every day struggles with consulting on a major Hollywood movie.

Still Alice, adapted from Lisa Genova's hit 2007 novel, tackles the growing issue of early on-set Alzheimer's in women.

Oltz, 50, who is married with two teenage boys, was 46 years old with a high-pressured job as a nurse and caregiver when she started misplacing things, forgetting to turn off the oven, and struggling for words.

After a year of tests for a brain tumor, strokes, and even menopause, her doctor diagnosed Oltz with Alzheimer's. 

In Still Alice, Moore plays Alice Howland, a 50-year-old linguistics professor with three successful adult children who starts fumbling her words during lectures.

Diagnosed with the disease, she then faces a battle to find a way to retain elements of herself and cope with the prospect that she will die within 10 years.

Telling her story: Like Moore's character in the movie, Oltz has sons who are having to come to terms with it

To inform her performance, which won her an Oscar, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award - to name a few - Moore turned to Oltz for whom this story is a reality.

When Oltz saw the premiere, she says, it was uncanny. 

'I don't know what I expected but when I saw it I was like "that's me in that movie!"' Oltz told Daily Mail Online. 'I didn't realize she'd picked up even little things about the way I act. 

'I was so impressed by her throughout the process of the film.

'She asked me questions and I tried to answer them but when I saw the film I was amazed. She really listened to me and watched me.  

'She brought the Alzheimer's disease experience to life with Alice.' 

A pivotal scene in the movie is Moore's speech to an Alzheimer's conference about her condition - which uses the same words Oltz wrote when she gave her first speech as an Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisor, which is now her full-time job.

Moore also used a highlighter during the speech to stay focused, which is something Oltz does all the time. 

And in the movie poster, Moore is clutching the medical bracelet around her wrist, which Oltz had told her was an incredibly difficult thing to accept.

Describing the creative process, Oltz said: 'Our first conversation was so nice because we just clicked. We talked about Alzheimer's but first we just talked about life and everything that we enjoyed.

'Then later she got on to questions like, "What does it feel like to have Alzheimer's?''

'I would say, "Well, it's like all these words [are here] and you can't find the right one."

'After people talk to me, they start to notice I stammer on words. 

'Every day you work so hard, you're just exhausted by the end of the day.' 

The movie also explores how the character comes to terms with her identity.

Alice prides herself on her intelligence and struggles to accept that she may have to relinquish that quality.

A new purpose: Oltz is now an Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisor and campaigns for support

She gives talks, like the character Alice does in the movie, and tries to help people deal with the same thing

It is an endeavor Oltz recognizes.

'My whole life has been identified by my professional work, which I can't do anymore.

'I was always Sandy the nurse, Sandy at the hospital, Sandy the caretaker. And that was stripped away as soon as I was diagnosed and it's no longer my identity. 

'It took a long time to re-identify myself and to work out, who am I? What am I contributing to society? The Alzheimer's Society has really helped me redirect myself by offering me a job as a coordinator.'

She also fears her teenage sons will not remember what she was like.

'I worry they're never going to know how smart I really was,' she told ABC. 'They see their mom as kind of funny because I have to be.' 

Oltz gave the movie '10 out of 10' and grew a strong bond with 'Julie', who she says gave a stellar performance.

For her children, it was not as clear cut.

'They liked it and they didn't like it,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'Alice is much further along than I am and I think that was very eye-opening for them, and quite upsetting. 

'But they enjoyed the performance and many parts of the film.

'For me, as someone who is on the same journey, all of the awards an accolades that have come to Julianne for her performance, including the Oscar, are so well deserved and so important to all of us with Alzheimer's disease.'
