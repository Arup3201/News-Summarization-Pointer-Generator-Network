The last rites for the FA’s doomed international committee are effectively being played out over the current week of England matches.

The committee, who used to be responsible for running the England team as well as hiring and firing managers, are now barely carrying out their marginalised ambassador role.

Instead of the three councillors who usually accompany the England team, there was only Wycombe’s Ivor Beeks with the senior side in Estonia. And none of the 12-strong committee have travelled with England’s Under 21s to Croatia for the second leg of their Euro 2015 qualifying play-off on Tuesday.

Even more farcically for the IC, who haven’t met since 2011, is that they were overhauled last summer to bring in club chief executives such as Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis and Sunderland’s invisible Margaret Byrne, who haven’t the time or inclination to go on England trips.

Meanwhile, some experienced blazers free of work pressures have been booted off international duties. Former IC stalwarts call the policy a ‘disgrace’, saying there will be long-term damage to the FA’s standing around the world if the meeting and greeting is abandoned.

There has been concern expressed by England sponsors about agent Terry Byrne starting sports management agency Ten10 that represents Jack Wilshere, when he also oversees the 1966 operation looking after the combined commercial interests of the England squad. 

But Byrne says the FA have agreed his twin role and he would not jeopardise the relationships he has built up with agents over 20 years by attempting to sign their England players. Byrne adds the new agency is not just about football but attracting stars from other sports including rugby and golf.

Liverpool's flying winger Raheem Sterling made a swift return from England duty after the win

The FA were saying before the Estonia match that there wasn’t a single incident last week of a club persuading a player to pull out of representing his country during an international round of fixtures involving games at senior, Under 21, U20, and U19 level.

But that was before Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling said he was too tired to start against Estonia, for whatever reason. Fortunately the England team charter back from Tallinn stopped off first at Manchester to allow the North West players, including Sterling, the quickest journey home — although the flight arrangements were made before all the fuss kicked off about Raheem.

100m follow Ronaldo

Real Madrid galactico Cristiano Ronaldo, the sports darling of social media, will sometime today become the first athlete to have 100million Facebook followers. This puts him nearly 30m fans in front of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, his rival for world No 1 footballer.

The commercial power of Ronaldo, who also has 30.5m Twitter followers, was demonstrated when he posted six messages over two days advertising the Tag Heuer watch brand. These received 34.9m Facebook hits and 2.4m likes, valued at more than £300,000 by the watch company.

Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development, has been effectively anointed the body’s new technical director by Greg Dyke. FA chairman Dyke said Ashworth, who has made his mark quickly since arriving from West Bromwich, would be filling that all-powerful role when explaining the new command structure for operating his England Commission grass-roots reforms.

Brighton, whose owner Tony Bloom has ploughed more than £150million into the club, have been given the top rating of any team in the country for their academy, part of a new £30million training facility. No wonder Bloom is impatient for his go-ahead outfit to be doing far better than 19th in the Championship. 

Roy Keane will be on the panel at a sports writing festival at Lord’s

A sports writing festival at Lord’s partly organised by the MCC has footballer Roy Keane and his ghost writer Roddy Doyle on one of its guest panels a week on Saturday, but no booking for cricketer Kevin Pietersen, who was unavailable to talk about his new publication.
