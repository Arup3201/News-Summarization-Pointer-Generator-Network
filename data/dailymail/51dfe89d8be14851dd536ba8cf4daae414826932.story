RBS repeatedly ignored warnings about Sir Fred Goodwin's 'assertive and robust' management style from as early as 2003, the FSA said today.

The regulator raised concerns about chief executive dominance during its meetings with the bank's chairman over the following three years.

But the FSA was assured that the rest of the board provided an adequate challenge to Sir Fred, nicknamed 'Fred the Shred', who now enjoys a pension worth £342,500 a year.

The report also highlighted the strained relationship between the FSA and Sir Fred prior to 2005, in particular RBS's reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA on an individual one-to-one basis.

It added: 'FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference.'

The bank stood out among its peers in terms of the regularity and vigour of its pushback against FSA policy initiatives, although the watchdog said its relationship began to improve after a clear-the-air meeting with Sir Fred in October 2004.

Highlighting the deficiencies in RBS's management, governance and culture, the FSA said that under Sir Fred's leadership the RBS board failed to consider in sufficient depth the risks involved in its ABN Amro takeover, preferring to concentrate on the scope for cost-cutting and synergies.

The report suggests that RBS's successful acquisition and integration of NatWest in 2000, which was overseen by Sir Fred, may have led to over-confidence in the board's thinking on the ABN Amro takeover.

Former investment banking boss Johnny Cameron told an FSA team: 'After we bought NatWest, we had lots of surprises, but almost all of them were pleasant. And I think that lulled us into a sense of complacency around that.'

While the hostile nature of the takeover meant it could undertake only limited due diligence, the FSA said the 17-strong RBS board failed in its duties over the ABN takeover.

It added: 'With so much at stake, there was a critical need for more fundamental probing, questioning and challenge by the board.'

The report revealed City watchdogs admitted a catalogue of errors and flaws, including poor management under the former chief executive.

The long-awaited report shed light on what went wrong in the run up to the £45.5billion rescue in 2008, which ended with the state owning more than 80 per cent of the bank.

The FSA identified six key factors in 
the failure of RBS, most significantly its weak capital position and 
over-reliance on risky short-term funding in wholesale markets.

RBS pursued a series of acquisitions,
 including NatWest in 1999 and U.S. bank Charter One in 2004, but it was
 Sir Fred’s disastrous £50billion purchase of Dutch lender ABN Amro in 
2007 – the biggest bank takeover in history – that proved a buy too far.

October 10, 2007: RBS declares takeover of ABN 'unconditional', but market value of assets plummet in the credit crunch

August 8, 2008: RBS reports pre-tax losses of £691m for the first half of the year, its first loss in 40 years

October 13, 2008: The Government announces plan to take £20bn stake in RBS

January 19 2009: Sir Fred steps down as chief executive and Government increases its stake to 70%.

In terms of the ABN Amro acquisition, 
the FSA said RBS proceeded without appropriate heed to the risks 
involved and with due diligence from the Dutch bank that in April 2007 
amounted to 'two lever-arch folders and a CD'.

The FSA said the seventh key factor in explaining the bank's demise was the management, led by Sir Fred.

It said: 'The multiple poor decisions that RBS made suggest that there 
are likely to have been underlying deficiencies in RBS management, 
governance and culture which made it prone to make poor decisions.'

FSA regulators were unable to monitor
 banks as complex as RBS because they lacked the right skills, while 
checks at the bank were also flawed.

The FSA admitted it was under pressure to adopt the 'light-touch' approach created by Gordon Brown.

It added: 'This approach reflected 
widely held, but mistaken assumptions about the stability of financial 
systems and existed against a backdrop of political pressures for a 
'light touch' regulatory regime.'

Today's report includes a recommendation
 that banks should gain regulatory approval for significant acquisitions
 and asks whether bank directors should be forced to prove their 
innocence in the event of a future failure.

However, it confirms that the FSA does not intend to pursue any new enforcement action against any of RBS's former directors.

FSA chairman Adair Turner said: 'The fact that no individual has been 
found legally responsible for the failure begs the question: if action 
cannot be taken under existing rules, should not the rules be changed 
for the future?'

Business Secretary Vince Cable today said he will continue to look into the issue following the report.

Mr Cable, whose department is in charge of bringing disqualification proceedings, has asked his legal team to provide further advice on what course of action is open to him in the light of the review.

He has already been given 'underlying evidence' from accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in February but was advised this was insufficient to proceed.

The FSA said it was a different organisation to the one that failed to rein in RBS prior to its rescue.

It claimed it is 'a different organisation now' because it now has more resources, better skills and far greater focus on capital, liquidity and asset quality.

Its powers of supervision should be further strengthened under plans to split the regulator in two to create the Prudential Regulation Authority to monitor the strength of the banks and the Financial Conduct Authority to look at legal issues.
