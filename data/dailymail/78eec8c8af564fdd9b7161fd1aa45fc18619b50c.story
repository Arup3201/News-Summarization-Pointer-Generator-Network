Bruce Springsteen's son has graduated from a fire academy in New Jersey and is now set to become a fire fighter.

Sam Springsteen may be eschewing his parents' musical paths, but he is at least staying true to the family's New Jersey roots.

The 20-year-old passed the rigorous course at the Monmouth County Fire Academy in Howell, New Jersey on January 15 and his parents were at the graduation ceremony.

'My youngest son, Sam, graduated from Monmouth County Fire Academy tonight. #Proud #OurFamilyHero,' Sam Springsteen's mom Patti Scialfa wrote on her Instagram account

The family: Sam Springsteen- seen left with his sister Jessica, mother Patti Scialfa, grandmother Pamela and father Bruce in February 2008- was one of 42 students to pass the rigorous course

His mother, singer and E Street Band member Patti Scialfa, posted a picture to her Instagram account of Sam in his fire uniform and showed her maternal pride in the hashtags.

'My youngest son, Sam, graduated from Monmouth County Fire Academy tonight. #Proud #OurFamilyHero,' she wrote.

Sam, who has appeared at rallies for President Obama when his famous father was on call to sing to the crowds, was one of 42 people who graduated from the course.

'He’s very smart... he enjoyed what he was doing,' Monmouth County Fire Marshal Henry Stryker III said.

Connections: Rather than follow in his father's musical footsteps, Sam- seen here at a 2008 rally for President Obama- chose to become a firefighter

Other pursuits: Sam's sister Jessica, seen with their parents in December, is a nationally-ranked equestrian

'This is not an easy course,' Mr Stryker said to The Asbury Park Press.

'There’s a lot of physical stuff and a lot of book work.'

Among the list of 'physical stuff' involved in the course is over 188 hourse of training that covers fire extinguishment, hazardous materials response preparation and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.

Springsteen and Scialfa have two other children.

Evan, 24, graduated from Boston College and is a singer and songwriter, and Jessica, 22, is a senior at Duke University and is a nationally-ranked equestrian.
