Ageist comments about Madonna's fall at the BRITs could deter firms from hiring older women, a government adviser claims today.

Older workers' tsar Ros Altmann said the reaction to the 56-year-old's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony 'encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate'.

It comes ahead of a new report which reveals how unconscious bias or outright age discrimination stops some employers from hiring the over-50s.

Madonna, 56, was pulled off the stage as she performed at the BRIT Awards in London last month

Madonna looked shocked - and briefly stopped singing - after she fell down a set of stairs at the BRIT Awards last month.

She failed to untie her cape in time for her dancers to rip it away as she took to the stage at London's 02 Arena.

Some onlookers praised her at the time for continuing to sing her new song, Living For Love, as proof of her professionalism after more than three decades in the business.

But others argued that the embarrassing incident was proof that she should rethink her stage persona.

Mrs Altmann said the media coverage after the fall was typical of the way age is treated.

She told MailOnline: 'Much is often made of achievement with a reference to age.

'It's not uncommon to hear that 'despite' someone being a certain age they have achieved something commendable.

'The recent example of ageist comments after Madonna fell off the stage at the Brits encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate.

'Falling was nothing to do with her age and could have happened to any performer of any age.'

Madonna later laughed off the incident and said her Armani cape was simply tied 'too tight'.

She wrote: 'Armani hooked me up! My beautiful cape was tied too tight! But nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! Thanks for your good wishes! I'm fine!'

Ironically her new song referenced a fall. She later told ITV's Jonathan Ross: 'I'm never writing lyrics like that again! The universe was trying to teach me a lesson I guess.'

Mrs Altmann's report, expected to be released tomorrow, will call for urgent action to improve the chances of older workers.

It argues that the way in which the media often portrays older people adds to the bias which can put employers off taking on older staff.

It includes using pictures of the very elderly and frail to illustrate stories about people in their 50s or 60s.

Ministers are also warned that older women are more likely to lose their roles as main newsreaders than men.

Mrs Altmann added: 'The majority of people in their 50s and 60s are not old.

'But media stories about older people often use clips or stock images representing much more elderly and frail people.

'Wizened hands and walking sticks are not appropriate depictions of older people and merely reinforce negative discriminatory stereotypes.'

Minister for Pensions Steve Webb said: 'Beyond the age of fifty, people start falling out of the workplace at dramatic rates – but there is a compelling economic and business case for overcoming these obstacles to access this vast untapped talent in the UK labour market.

'The Government has made a good start by abolishing the default retirement age and extending the right to request flexible working. But it is clear that old-fashioned and outdated perceptions still persist.

'From next month, we will be trialling targeted and intensive support for older jobseekers, including rolling out an 'older workers' champion scheme across every part of the UK, and we are seeing more firms open apprenticeships up for people of all ages.

'I'd like to thank Dr Ros Altmann for report as a clear call to Government, business and individuals to encourage more older people into employment.'
