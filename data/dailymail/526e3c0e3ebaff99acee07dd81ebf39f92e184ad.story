A reformed thug donated his kidney to a mother-of-three in an attempt to atone for his violent past.

Peter Farrell, 42, admitted he was still haunted by the fact that as a young man he would beat up men who owed him money, and on one occasion was seen doing so by his victim's young son.

The incident shocked him into renouncing violence, but wanted to make up for his actions by donating one of his kidneys to Saira Khan, 41 - becoming one of Britain's first Good Samaritan donors.

Mr Farrell underwent the operation last month, saying he wanted to fulfill a promise made to his grandmother, who died 10 years ago, that he would do something good in his life after his violent actions as a younger man.

'I was very cruel. I used to hurt people. I used to beat up people for money,' he told The Sunday Times.

Father-of-four Mr Farrell, from east London, said that his grandmother had stood by him despite his violent escapades, and that he wanted to honour her request that he did something positive in his life.

Mr Farrell said donating his kidney had brought him closer to his family, and had made them 'proud' of him.

Mrs Khan, who suffered from kidney failure, had been searching for a donor since 2011, even advertising online in her attempt to find one.

Members of her family, including her solicitor husband Omar, were tested to see if they were a match, but none were.

Mr Farrell, who has worked as a barman and builder, did not know Mrs Khan, from south London, although he had met her Mr Khan previously.

Mr Khan had mentioned his wife's illness, prompting Mr Farrell to take action to help her, and he is one of the first donors in the country to choose which stranger is given an organ.

He said: 'Without a doubt, giving my kidney is the best thing I have ever done in my life. I am so happy for her and her kids.'

Mrs Khan, who has three children aged nine, four and three, is now recovering from her surgery on February 12, at St George's Hospital, Tooting.

She believes that if would-be donors knew who their organ would be going to they would be more willing to donate.

She said. 'He [Farrell] has saved my life. No one in my family could do it and he is a complete stranger.'

The NHS has previously directed altruistic donors to give their organs anonymously and the donor and recipient were banned from knowing each others' identity until after the operation, and with both giving consent for their names to be revealed.

There have only be 16 'directed altruistic' donations approved by the Human Tissue Authority, although it is not known how many have led directly to operations.

All organ donations from living people in the UK must be approved by the HTA, based on criteria set by Parliament.

The HTA ensures donors are aware of the risks associated with transplants, that they have not been offered any reward to donate and have not been put under pressure to do so.

Potential donors and recipients are interviewed by an Independent Assessor who then submits a report to the HTA.

During 2012/13 the HTA approved 104 non-directed cases, a rise from 38 in the previous year.

Altogether, the HTA approved 1243 living organ donation cases in 2012/13, up from 1217 in 2011/12, inclduing 1047 â€˜directedâ€™ kidney donations.

'Giving someone an organ is a brave and amazing gift: to do it for someone whom you don't know is doubly so, and the huge increase in people will do so is incredible,' said an HTA spokesman.

'The HTA works on more living donation cases every year, and we expect this to continue.'
