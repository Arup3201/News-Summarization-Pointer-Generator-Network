To his three children Horace Stokes was simply their adored father, a genial greengrocer who later switched to pulling pints as a pub landlord.

He never spoke about his harrowing experiences as a soldier during the Second World War, not even with his close family.

It was only on his deathbed, after decades of silence, that Mr Stokes passed on to his children a dusty old diary to which – 20 years after the war – he had secretly committed the memories of his wartime exploits.

Extraordinary: Just before the death of Horace Stokes (pictured left in 1944) he asked his son Peter (right) to come to his bedside because he had 'something important' to leave him - and presented him with a diary

Memories: The journal left by Horace Stokes to his son Peter detailing the extent of his time in the SAS

Teenager: At the age of 18, Horace Stokes (left) volunteered to join the Territorial Army's 121st Artillery and was mobilised two weeks into his training at the outbreak of war

To their astonishment and pride, the journal revealed an extraordinary tale of heroism – and that modest Mr Stokes had actually been a founding member of the SAS.

For the first time, his children learned how their father had fought the Nazis behind enemy lines, and escaped from two PoW camps.

Because he was in the Special Air Service – formed in July 1941 – Mr Stokes was sworn to secrecy and never discussed his time on secret missions across occupied Europe.

It was shortly before he died from cancer at the age of 64 that he presented his children with the stories of his time with the Who Dares Wins regiment.

By then his son Peter was 24 and had already embarked on own distinguished, military career.

He has now published his father’s memoir as a book entitled No Ordinary Life.

Recalling the days before his father’s death in 1986, Peter Stokes, said: ‘He wanted me to come home to talk to me because there were things he needed to tell me.

'He handed me the journal and I could barely believe what it contained. I was filled with pride and totally awestruck.

‘He was involved in some of the most famous raids during the Second World War, and yet he’d never mentioned a word of it.

'At the end of the war he closed the door on what he had done.

'He had killed many, many people and had seen his best friends killed.

‘But while he had closed the door I know there was not a night that passed where he did not sit and reflect on what had happened.’

Peter Stokes went on to become a decorated serviceman, earning an MBE as Commander of No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, based at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall.

He said of his father: ‘He was never decorated, he never received a medal.

'I didn’t do half of what he did and ended up with an MBE and a Queen’s Commendation.’

Horace Stokes grew up in Birmingham and was just 18 when he signed up with the Territorial Army in 1939.

He went on to serve with 12 Commando, with the Small Scale Raiding Force and eventually with the newly-formed 2nd Special Air Service.

His secret journal recalls daring missions across Europe, describing in detail how he parachuted behind enemy lines before blowing up or sabotaging strategic Nazi targets.

It also documents his capture and imprisonment in two different PoW camps and the harrowing moment a Gestapo agent placed a gun to his head during an interrogation.

Sgt Stokes took part in legendary raids including Operation Basalt, a raid on the German-occupied British Channel Island of Sark in 1942, and Operation Speedwell, an early SAS assault against Italian rail targets near Genoa in 1943.

But when ‘Stokey’, as he was known, was demobbed, he settled into life as a greengrocer and later a publican, never breathing a word about his missions.

Peter Stokes said yesterday: ‘Leading up to his death he was very strong and had a real spark.

'I read the journal and we discussed many of the stories.

'He was landed by parachute, submarine and boat in enemy-held territory time and time again and the fact that he survived is incredible.

‘One that really stuck with me was how he cycled 230km throughout the night in enemy-held territory while very close to death.

'He managed to survive living off the land.’

Despite his modesty, Horace’s journal makes clear how highly he valued his wartime comrades.

One extract reads: ‘There were nights practising landings in the Outer Hebrides. And through it all a deep sense of comradeship and terrific pride in our superb physical fitness and toughness.

'A knowledge that we were to be classed amongst the finest soldiers in the world.’

Describing how he came to learn of his father’s past, Mr Stokes, a father of three from Cornwall, said: ‘I was getting ready for a Christmas party in 1986 when my sister phoned me in floods of tears and told me that Dad was dying.

‘He had come to my graduation in RAF Cranwell in 1984 and was very proud – but even then I had no idea what he had done with his life. In the end I think he wanted to unburden himself.’

Horace Stokes had just a few weeks to discuss his secret life with Peter, his other son Graham and daughter Pat, before he died.

Peter said: ‘I wanted to publish the book so my children can learn about their grandfather’s incredible wartime experiences.’

No Ordinary Life is on sale at Amazon and other leading book stores priced £6.99.
