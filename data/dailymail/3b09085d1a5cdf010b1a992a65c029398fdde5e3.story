'Concerned': Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the highly respected Ernst & Young Item Club

Ed Miliband does not have the right ‘mind-set’ to run the country and has an unrealistic view of how business works, a leading economist says today.

Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the highly respected Ernst & Young Item Club, says he is ‘concerned’ about the prospect of a Labour government after the general election in May.

The former Treasury mandarin says ‘even Neil Kinnock’ would have been a safer pair of hands than Mr Miliband because ‘he knew the way the world worked’.

The unflattering comparison with the former Labour leader – who lost the 1992 election to John Major – will delight Tories hoping for a similar result in May.

Mr Spencer says George Osborne’s plans to cut state spending to the lowest level since the 1930s will not lead to ‘Armageddon’ despite protest from the left.

‘The world has moved on from the 1930s,’ says Mr Spencer, dismissing claims from Labour and the unions that the Tories’ plans would cripple public services. 

He says whoever is Chancellor after the election will need to return Britain to the black and start paying down the national debt after two decades of borrowing.

The comments, in an interview with the Daily Mail, will come as a boost for Mr Osborne ahead of the budget next week.

Mr Miliband has pledged to ‘bring back socialism’ and is planning to raise taxes on business, high earners and owners of expensive homes.

The boss of chemist chain Boots has warned a Labour government would be a catastrophe and Mr Spencer says he is now also worried about the prospects of a Labour government.

‘This is the first election where I have not been able to wholeheartedly support Labour’s policies,’ he says.

‘Labour used to be quite concerned about the way the economy actually works. 

'Labour’s heart has always been in the right place, no question, but they do have a little bit of a problem in understanding the way the world works.’
