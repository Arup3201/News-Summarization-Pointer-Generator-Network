The average cost of raising a child to secondary school age is £84,000, with half of the money being spent on childcare, according to new figures.

Caring for a child from birth up until the age of 11 will set a household back by almost half the average UK house price, which stood at £187,188 in September, the survey by Halifax found.

The bulk of the total £83,627-a-year bill comes from childcare before children reach school age, which at about £41,139 makes up almost half of the whole cost of raising a child to the age of 11.

The average cost of raising a child to secondary school age is £84,000, a survey of 1,000 parents found

The estimates were taken from research among 1,000 parents of children aged up to 11.

Typically, parents were found to be spending £633 a month on their children, adding up to £7,602 a year.

The survey also found that the first year of a child's life is the most expensive, costing £8,500 on average.

Food: £77.41

Schooling: £44.85

Holidays: £59.17

Clothes: £38.81

Toys: £23.42

Leisure and hobbies: £39.23

Furniture: £18.35

Personal care: £20.64

Childcare: £311.66

Total monthly cost: £633.54 

As children reach school age and less money is needed to go towards childcare, the annual cost of raising a child falls to around £6,489.

The survey also took into account the amount spent on food during a child’s lifetime, with parents forking out the most to feed their youngsters when they are aged between nine and 11.

The average monthly spend on food for this age was found to be £87, while those with children aged five to eight years old spent £71 per month.

Holiday costs were also found to reach a peak for parents when children hit the ages of between five and eight. 

The amount spent on trips for the average family was said to average around £71 per month.
