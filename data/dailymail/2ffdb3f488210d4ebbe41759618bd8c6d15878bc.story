John Terry’s 100th Champions League appearance was clearly something to celebrate — though perhaps the Chelsea skipper was being a touch ambitious by attempting to score from 100 yards, his first-half free kick falling short and dribbling wide. 

Still it is a remarkable achievement for Terry, who made his first appearance in the competition as an ungainly 22-year-old against Slovakian club MSK Zilina alongside Marcel Desailly, Glen Johnson and Wayne Bridge in 2003.

Jose Mourinho warned that his former club’s ground could be a bit of a bear pit. And so it proved with the incessant chanting and deafening whistles that greeted the first-half performance of Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz showing Sporting fans at their vociferous best. Their anger reached a peak when former Benfica player Nemanja Matic opened the scoring.

William Carvalho is a little too slow around the pitch to justify his £37million price tag for some Premier League sides. Certainly Arsenal baulked at paying that in August. 

That said, he knows his role in front of the back four well and his muscular frame represents a considerable obstacle. Arsene Wenger would be glad to have a player with those qualities at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

A world champion he may be but Andre Schurrle is on a miserable run in front of goal. After some wayward finishing against Bolton last week he missed two great chances here. Maybe Mourinho had a point when he told him to be more clinical after a hat-trick at Fulham last season.
