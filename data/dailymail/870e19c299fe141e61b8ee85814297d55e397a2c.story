Powerful backbench critic: Bernard Jenkins fears that the Tories are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday as dissatisfied voters turn to UKIP

A senior Tory MP has warned that the party is set to lose 50 seats at the next Election, giving Ed Miliband the keys to No 10.

Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin claims the Tories are sleepwalking to an electoral doomsday, with many MPs unaware they face being turfed out by voters.

And Mr Jenkin said that instead of attacking UKIP leader Nigel Farage, the Prime Minister should be copying his policies on issues such as immigration – because grassroots Tory supporters back them.

In private remarks to fellow Conservatives, leading Eurosceptic Mr Jenkin said: ‘On present trends we are going to lose 50 seats – and most of them don’t even realise it.

'It has got to the ridiculous position where Nigel Farage is telling us what our policy on immigration should be – and he is right.’

If the Conservatives were to lose 50 seats, that would almost certainly result in Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister.

Polling experts say that it is the switch of Tory voters to UKIP that will allow Labour to grab key Conservative seats in marginal constituencies.

Mr Jenkin, MP for Harwich & North Essex, told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘I have been quite open about what I believe.

'We must reclaim control of our immigration laws so that British Ministers and Parliament can decide who enters our country, on what terms, how long they can stay and what benefits they are entitled to receive.

‘Nigel Farage says many things which many voters and many Conservative supporters agree with. We should adopt them as our policies.’

Asked if he had forecast the Conservatives would lose 50 seats, he said: ‘If the General Election took place today, based on current opinion polls, yes, the Conservatives would lose seats. But we have every opportunity to put things right and I will be campaigning flat out for a David Cameron victory.’

Mr Jenkin, the son of Patrick Jenkin, who served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet, is emerging as one of Mr Cameron’s most powerful backbench Tory critics.

Last month he organised a letter signed by more than 90 Conservative MPs calling on the Prime Minister to push for a national veto on all current and future EU laws.

If Mr Jenkin’s forecast is correct, high-profile figures in the firing line include: Environment Minister George Eustice (Camborne & Redruth, the second most vulnerable Conservative seat); James Wharton, the MP behind the EU Referendum Bill (Stockton South, 8th most vulnerable); Defence Minister Anna Soubry (Broxtowe, 9th); and Ben Gummer (Ipswich, 35th), son of former Cabinet Minister John Gummer.

Mr Cameron came under further attack last night from another Right-wing Essex Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell (Clacton).

Mr Carswell said George Osborne’s economic policy would lead to another Gordon Brown-style cycle of boom and bust.

Mr Carswell writes in today’s Mail on Sunday: ‘Strong though the economic rebound might be, the Coalition is making some serious mistakes.

‘Mr Osborne has adopted much the same monetary approach as his predecessor. This “Osbrown” economic policy means Britain is now more dependent on consumer spending and mortgage debt than ever before.’
