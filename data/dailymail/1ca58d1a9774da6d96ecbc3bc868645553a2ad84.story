Toy store giant Toys R Us has predicted which 50 toys parents will be fighting to get their hands on this Christmas.

The playtime retailer’s ‘Hot Toy’ list includes two tablet computers especially designed for children, One Direction dolls and returning retro favourite Furby.

To help stressed parents Toys R Us are launching a reservation service to calm parents in the run up to the holiday season and ensure they do not miss out on Christmas morning's stocking must-haves.

Top toys: 1990's hit Furby and Doctor McStuffins were named two of the most coveted toys for this Christmas

Creative: The Gelarti toy allows children to make their own removable stickers

The retailer will let customers reserve the top-15 plus an additional 35 items they predict to be on childrens’ Christmas wish lists this year.

The reservation system will run through the end of October. Toys must be reserved in stores and customers have to make a 20 per cent down payment.

The top-15 are a mix of technology and educational fun.

The late 90s hit Furby is back with updated LED eyes and, of course, connected to a smartphone app with which you can feed and play with the fluffy animatronic animal.

The LeapPad tablet which was a success last year has been updated faster processors, better memory capability, and improved battery life.

British boyband One Direction have taken the charts by storm since their debut single What Makes You Beautiful last year, and as with all pop idols it did not take too long before they got their very own plastic doubles.

All five members are available, curls and quiffs and all, as fashion dolls and heart-breaker Harry even comes in two different versions.

There's no indication yet of a runaway success like 2009's Zhu Zhu Pets stuffed hamsters and last year's Leapfrog LeapPad tablet. But Toys R Us executives are betting that if there is, it is on their list.

‘We have an incredibly skilled team of merchants here that track new products and identify toys,’ said Lisa Harnisch, the company's general merchandising manager.‘

Tablet: Tabeo has 50 preloaded apps, including Prime Minister David Cameron's favourite, Angry Birds, and a seven inch screen

Activity: The Y Volution Fliker F1 Flow Series Scooter, left, is self-propelled by the rider's movement and the 42-inch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's playset should keep any child entertained - at least until boxing day

The holiday season is crucial for toy sellers accounting for up to 40 per cent of the annual sales for retailers.

Last year, U.S. retail sales of toys fell two per cent to $21.18 billion, according to research firm NPD Group.
