Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie at the Belvoir hunt ball in March 2006

A man who was shot in the face by a homeowner defending his cottage from masked burglars was out on licence for a previous crime when the raid took place.

Joshua O’Gorman, 27, pleaded guilty to burglary after admitting breaking into the secluded property near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in the early hours of September 2.

He was on licence at the time he broke
into the  cottage, having been released early from a 14-month 
prison sentence imposed in August last year for dangerous driving.

Loughborough Magistrates’ Court  heard O’Gorman had previous convictions for dishonesty, burglary, and driving offences.

The 27-year-old and a second man - 
Daniel Mansell, 33 - were blasted with a shotgun by homeowner Andrew 
Ferrie - and arrested when they turned up at a hospital two hours later.

Mr Ferrie, 35, and his 43-year-old wife Tracey, who live at the cottage, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after O’Gorman and Mansell sought treatment from doctors ten miles away for their injuries.

O’Gorman was shot in side of the face while Mansell was hit in the right hand.

But prosecutors later announced the Ferries would face no further charges after deciding they had acted in 'reasonable self-defence.'

Earlier the court heard heard Mansell took part in the raid believing there was a large amount of cash and cannabis at the house.

However, no evidence of either was found at the cottage.

O’Gorman, who appeared via videolink with a large gash to the right hand side of his face clearly visible, admitted burglary with intent to steal.

Sukhy Singh, prosecuting, said O’Gorman’s girlfriend received a phone call at around 12.40am on the night of the raid from a friend of his 'screaming down the line for her to get an ambulance.'

Mr Singh added: 'He said that her partner had been shot in the face, and that they were coming to her address.

The earlier hearing was told how, on the evening of the incident, Mr Ferrie and his wife went to bed at 10.15pm before being woken by banging and breaking glass shortly after midnight

'They did arrive and the defendant was in a bad way as he had been shot in the face.

'For some reason the ambulance did not
arrive, and the friend took her car keys and took the defendant to 
hospital, where he was arrested.'

They were then confronted by a number of masked raiders - who fled after Mr Ferrie fired the legally-held shotgun.

O’Gorman and Mansell, both of Leicester, will be sentenced at the city’s Crown Court on September 25.

Mansell, who was also out on licence at the time of the incident, pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal at the earlier hearing.

Nabeel Gatrad, defending O’Gorman, said he would not be applying for bail.

Mr Gatrad added: 'He is realistic about the likely sentence he will receive.'

Two other men, aged 31 and 23, were 
arrested following the raid on suspicion of aggravated burglary and 
released on bail pending further enquiries.
