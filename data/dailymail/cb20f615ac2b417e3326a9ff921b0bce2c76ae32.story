Brooklyn Beckham has reportedly signed an academy contract with Arsenal despite apparent interest from  Chelsea and his father David's former club, Manchester United.

The eldest son of the former England captain was wanted by a number of Barclays Premier League sides, but the 15-year-old is understood to have opted for Arsenal after impressing coaches in north London.

Brooklyn has been training with the Gunners and playing for their Under-16 side, having previously had trials with Chelsea, United, Queens Park Rangers and Fulham.

It is thought Brooklyn, who has experience on the right wing, could  be offered a professional contract if he impresses during his short-term deal in north London. Bookmakers Coral place Brooklyn at 14/1 to appear in the Premier League and 33/1 to play for England at senior level.

Despite David's history at Old Trafford, the Beckham family have strong connections with Arsenal. 

The former Real Madrid midfielder's youngest son Cruz, nine, is a member of the Under-10 side while Romeo, 12, plays for Arsenal's Under-13s.

Beckham Snr trained with Arsenal in January last year to keep fit after leaving LA Galaxy at the end of the Major League Soccer season, before joining Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain where the 39-year-old retired.

An Arsenal source told the Daily Star: 'Brooklyn is talented and he has stood out in all of the training sessions and games he has played. 

'He has had other teams sniffing around and it was always going to be a case of when, not if, he was signed up by a big-name club.

'Arsenal realise he can be a huge talent. They have seen that potential and protected their asset. The club has signed him, fending off interest from Manchester United and Chelsea in the meantime. Next summer we may see him sign a big-money deal and with Arsenal.'

Professional contracts cannot be signed until the player is 17, but clubs can reach pre-agreements with their targets. 

As yet, there is no official word from the Beckham camp or Arsenal as to whether the reports are true.
