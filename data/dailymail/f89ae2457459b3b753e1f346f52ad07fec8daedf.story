He's often lauded as one of the world's most sexiest men - but David Beckham has revealed a distinctly un-sexy memory.

The retired footballer has confessed to performing a sex act on himself while looking at calendar of Welsh footballer Clayton Blackmore as part of his initiation into Manchester United's youth team.

The 38-year-old recalled how his Class of '92 teammates forced him to perform an embarrassing sex act whilst staring at eighties Reds legend Clayton Blackmore.

Beckham revealed he had to look at Clayton Blackmore's calendar and do certain things to himself

The midfielder said he got the short-straw with his humiliation, revealing to the Metro: ‘One of mine was surprising! The Clayton Blackmore!’

Recalling his teen horror, he said: ‘Everyone had an initiation that you had to go through on the youth team, that was one of the most uncomfortable ones!’

'The fact that I had to look at Clayton Blackmore’s calendar and do certain things, while looking at Clayton Blackmore…’

Forced to recall the humiliating ceremony on camera for a documentary on his former team, called 'The Class of '92', he said: ‘I was embarrassed when I was saying it on camera let alone talking about it more.

But it’s something that we all had to go through. It was definitely something I wouldn’t like to go through again!'

David Beckham, who has four children with wife Victoria, says he would rather forget the ritual

The retired footballer is promoting a Manchester United documentary covering the period from 1992, where he, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Phil and Gary Neville were team-mates.

His confession follows a series of revelations,including that Sir Alex Ferguson was 
like 'the godfather' of Manchester United because of his totalitarian 
approach to managing the club.

He described the Reds' most-decorated manager as the 'godfather - and not in a good way,' to BBC Breakfast.

'Not in a bad way [either] but we were all very scared of him.'

The former United midfielder admitted that players were 'scared' of the patriarch, renowned for his sharp Scottish tongue.

The 38-year-old, who retired at the end of last season, also said he blew his first big pay packet on a flashy BMW.

'My first thing that I spent money on was a BMW. That was my first cheque from Adidas, and I just blew the whole thing in one go,' Beckham told the Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show on Absolute Radio.

'We started getting a little bit more money than we were in the youth team, you know, I went and blew it. I was still living in digs at the time, and I literally blew all my money on a BMW.'
