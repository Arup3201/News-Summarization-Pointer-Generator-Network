Ian Lam, 42, plunged to his death after falling from the top of a car park in Telford on Saturday

A suicidal man who died after he was goaded to 'jump' from a multi-storey car park has been described as a 'caring and loving young man' by his family.

Ian Lam, 42, plunged 60ft to his death on Saturday from the top of the car park outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford, Shropshire, as more than 30 people filmed the drama on their phones.

Witnesses described hearing some of the onlookers shouting 'get on with it', 'go on, jump' and even 'how far can you bounce?'.

Their actions were condemned by police who said that those who took the offensive photographs and posted footage of his death on social media could face prosecution.

His family said through a statement: 'The wife, family and friends of the man who was involved in a tragic incident in Telford Town Centre on Saturday would like to express their deep sorrow and overwhelming feeling of loss of such a kind, caring and loving man.

'This has been an extremely traumatic time for all of them and I would also ask that their privacy be respected.' 

Detective Inspector William Scott, from West Mercia Police, said: 'Our thoughts are with Mr Lam's family and friends at this very difficult time.

'This has been an extremely traumatic time for all of them and I would also ask that their privacy be respected.'

Officers were called to the scene outside the busy shopping centre at around 1pm but despite attempts by specialist negotiators, but he fell from the ledge two hours later. 

A man of 57 who was in a building opposite said: 'I saw a crowd of people of all ages, some with small children, gathered outside watching this poor man. Many were taking pictures.'

The onlooker, who did not want to be named, said the man had waited on the ledge for more than two hours while a crowd of around 30 gathered below. 

He said that, although police had cordoned off the scene, some of the mob ducked under the tape to see more.

'I just felt for the guy,' the witness said. 'I can't imagine what frame of mind he could be in to want to do this. As for those who did take pictures and posted them – they should be ashamed.'

A jeering mob encouraged Mr Lam to 'get on with it and jump' before he plunged to his death from a car park in Telford, Shropshire (above)

Another witness, Kelly-Anne Taylor, 35, said: 'People were recording it with their phones and yelling at him to jump.

'I can't stop thinking about it. I could have tried to help him. I am so heartbroken for him and his family. Onlookers were yelling at him to jump.' 

Others took to social media to tell of their disgust. One woman wrote: 'The fact people were shouting for the man to jump from that building in Southwater and filming it make me worry for our generation. Scum.'

The force said it was analysing an image posted on social media and that it would take 'appropriate action' if it established a criminal offence had been committed. 

In a statement, the force added: 'As is normal following an incident such as this, where a person has contact with police prior to their death (in this case police officers and negotiators who reasoned with him prior to the fall) this case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

'The IPCC has confirmed that they will not investigate this incident and they are satisfied that the force's Professional Standards Department carry out a review.'

West Mercia Police has hit out at the 'appalling' actions of the crowd who gathered outside Southwater Shopping Centre in Telford (pictured), and said anyone who chanted should be 'unequivocally condemned'

Following the incident Inspector Ben Smith, from the force's operational control centre, had condemned the sickening comments hurled at the vulnerable victim.

He said: 'Obviously we would certainly not be supportive of that kind of behaviour.

'It is pretty appalling because it is someone who is clearly in need of support and assistance. That behaviour is something we would condemn.

'Clearly what that individual needed was time and space and a professional to help them out.

'The individual would have been in need of care and support and appropriate intervention from medical professionals, so anything like that to encourage someone to jump should be unequivocally condemned.'

A petition has been launched on campaigning website Change.org calling for those who 'encouraged' the victim to be arrested. In just five hours it gathered more than 1,000 signatures.

Friends of the man took to the website to voice their disgust. Jacqueline Hickman wrote: 'This man was a friend, a lovely warm, caring man. The people who goaded him are despicable. They all deserve to be arrested.'

Rebecca Hadley said: 'I am appalled with the behaviour of the Telford people and worked closely with the poor man who took his life.'
