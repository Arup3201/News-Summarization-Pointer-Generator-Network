An unsatisfied customer in California is suing the author of Fifty Shades of Grey and a British sex toy company for unspecified damages, claiming a lubricant they released under the S&M book's brand failed to deliver the pleasure it promised.

The lubricant - Fifty Shades of Grey: Come Alive Pleasure Gel for Her - was one of many erotic products released by Lovehoney in conjunction with the novel's author, E.L. James, who approved each item.

The arousal gel's packaging said users would 'experience enhanced orgasms and stimulation as every tingle, touch and vibration intensifies'.

It also featured a quote from the tome's main character and narrator, Anastasia Steele, reading: 'I surrender, exploding around him — a draining, soul-grabbing orgasm that leaves me spent and exhausted.'

Failed to make me come alive: California woman Tania Warchol claims the $14.99 'Come Alive Pleasure Gel' - which promises to deliver 'stimulation as every tingle, touch and vibration and intensifies' - did not work

However, the unhappy consumer, Tania Warchol, said the lubricant - which costs $14.99 - failed to perform, and also claims the slippery substance is incompatible with latex, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Warchol said she bought two tubes of the gel from an Adam & Eve store in California. 

She is seeking a refund and punitive damages.

Warchol has also filed her lawsuit as a class action, inviting other California residents who were also displeased with the product to join her effort.

'Based on (the) Defendants' representations, (the) Plaintiff believed the Product has powerful aphrodisiac qualities and would increase her sexual pleasure as advertised,' reads the complaint, which was obtained by THR.

'The Product did not deliver the purported benefits.'

Warchol also claims the lubricant has been mislabeled, because anything purporting to be an 'aphrodisiac' needs approval from the Federal Drug Administration.

Steamy: While the Fifty Shades of Grey movie will be released next week, it is not involved with the lawsuit

Sued: Author E.L. James attends the "Fifty Shades Of Grey" New York Fan First screening at Ziegfeld Theatre on February 6, 2015 in New York City

The product has been on shelves for the last four years, following the runaway success of the book in 2011. 

However their popularity has increased ahead of the release of the much-hyped film adaptation, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, which hits cinemas on February 13.

The range also includes nipple clamps, two different dildos and a Fifty Shades Of Grey Soothe Me After Spanking Cream, which 'boasts the luxurious aroma of sandalwood, bergamot and musk, Christian’s signature scent'.

Universal Pictures, producers of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie, has not been named in the lawsuit, because they are not affiliated with the products.

E.L. James - who sold the film rights to her book series, a trilogy, to Universal Pictures and Focus Features in March 2012 - has not commented on the suit.

She attended the film's world premiere in New York on Friday night.

Runaway success: The products were released following the popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2011

According to Entertainment Weekly, the lawsuit will have numerous obstacles to overcome in order to be successful.

Above all, the action will have to prove the fact the lubricant did not work, which may be tricky to say the least. 

Elle magazine describe the lawsuit as 'insane'.
