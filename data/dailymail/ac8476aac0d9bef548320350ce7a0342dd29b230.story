Ten minutes or so into the second half of Manchester United's FA Cup game against Cambridge on Tuesday night, the home team were winning 2-0 and progress to the next round was all but assured. 

United's captain, however, was found 20 yards inside his own half executing a sliding tackle on breaking opponent Cameron McGheean.

This, in essence, is the new life of Wayne Rooney. England's captain and most reliable centre forward is no longer a striker for his own football club. Louis van Gaal's team formation all but confirmed what Rooney has known for a while and as national coach Roy Hodgson attempts to move his own team forward he is going to have to accept it, too.

Rooney has always liked to tackle, has always liked to roam the field in search of the ball. 

This is different, though. Van Gaal does not want to play Rooney as a central striker anymore, a fact confirmed when he sent his team out with Marouane Fellaini in a position further advanced than United's third-placed record goalscorer on Tuesday.

'I think he's a bit lost,' was the opinion of former United forward Lou Macari, now an in-house TV analyst. 'He's there to score goals.

'Can he play in midfield? He can because he's good but is it his best position? In last six or seven games, it's apparent that it's where he is going to play.

'He's the most natural goalscorer at the club and always has been. His goals tell you that. He knows whether to bend it, place it or drive it or take a touch. There is an art in that and he has got it.

'At the moment he is wasted in midfield. He was at the far post in front of how own goal with ten minutes to go, challenging as the Cambridge defender came in. United were 3-0 up.

'Why is he there? Is that really the best place for him?'

Rooney has long since been a victim of his own versatility and energy at Old Trafford. 

He tackles, passes and anticipates more than well enough to play in the middle of the field. Contrary to what Macari said, he does not look lost there but whether that is his best position is something that can only fuel debate.

Sir Alex Ferguson admitted six years ago that he had played Rooney out of position too often in order to accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo. He vowed to change that and never did.

David Moyes, meanwhile, spoke earnestly about restoring Rooney to his 'best position' last season but by that stage Robin van Persie was the club's automatic choice at 'number nine'.

There is a difference, though, between Rooney playing in and around a central striker and being transformed in to a much deeper player, a midfield player. 

Rooney always knew the change would come one day but – as he said in an interview last September – he did not expect it to come for a couple of years or more.

'The manager goes into so much detail about the opposition and there'll be times I'll be needed to play deeper or wider, which I've no problem doing,' Rooney told the Sunday Times.

'But in the main I feel I've still got at least two or three years up front. I know I've the qualities to play in midfield. I've done it comfortably.

'There'll come a time when I move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week, it could be in a couple of years. It's down to the manager and I'll accept it.'

Van Gaal has accelerated that process now. The United manager's centre forwards are now Van Persie, Radamel Falcao and young James Wilson. 

It's a decent line up, certainly, but the fact that Rooney is no longer on the list maybe says more about the lack of quality midfield options available to Van Gaal than anything else.

What Hodgson makes of it is anybody's guess. Van Gaal will not concern himself with this and nor should he. United's supporters – notoriously ambivalent about the national team – will not lose sleep either. 

The England head coach, though, will be concerned. This season has seen Hodgson's options in the centre forward department expand significantly.

At least one happy striker on Tuesday night was James Wilson, who scored as United beat Cambridge 3-0 at Old Trafford.

A Barclays Premier League season that has seen Harry Kane, Charlie Austin and Danny Ings blossom, for example, will surely be reflected in the squad when England gather for their next mind-numbing Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania next month.

What is certain, though, is that Hodgson started this campaign with the image on an attacking partnership of Daniel Sturridge and Rooney in mind for next summer's finals in France and will not have expected to consider deviating very much from that in the intervening months.

Currently Rooney has eight goals for his club this season and has scored in just one United game since the middle of December. 

Austin, meanwhile, has 13, Kane 20 and Ings – who didn't get going until the end of October – seven. These are statistics that very much reflect the direction of Rooney's career at United. 

Asked about it on Tuesday night, Van Gaal gave little away, preferring to talk about Fellaini's height – 'he is a very long player' – than the actual matter in hand. That is the United manager's prerogative. 

He will do what he thinks is best for his club and currently he is managing to nudge his peculiar and inconsistent team vaguely along in the right direction. 

They are third in the Premier League and now in round five of the FA Cup.

Rooney, though, must adjust to a drastic change in his circumstances. Had been deployed much further back on Tuesday night, he would have been untangling his studs from his own goal net.
