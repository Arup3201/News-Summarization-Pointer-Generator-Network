Millions of workers are being hit with extra tax demands as officials attempt to claw back under-payments - despite £300 million of reforms which were supposed to reduce errors.

HM Revenue and Customs last night revealed 5.3 million people paid the wrong amount in 2013-14, including 3.5 million who paid too little and will have to make extra contributions in future years.

Two million people who paid too much tax will be able to claim refunds.

Refund errors: HM Revenue and Customs revealed 3.5million people paid too little, and will have to now pay more this year, while 5.3million have paid the wrong amount in the last 12 months

HMRC has now started writing to those affected by the errors, which average £300 per person and have occurred despite reforms costing £270 million - supposed to improve the accuracy of the pay-as-you-earn system.

The number of people affected by errors has increased in 2013/14 from 5.2 million in 2012/13.

Changes to the tax system are supposed to use ‘real time information’ under which employers report details of what tax payments they have made to HMRC on a weekly or monthly basis, to ensure they are correct.

The number of errors under the new system has disappointed businesses.

Kate Upton, a payroll consultant, told the Daily Telegraph last night: ‘Taxpayers have spent hundreds of millions on RTI and employers have had to spend hundreds of millions to use the new system, so we are entitled to expect significantly fewer errors in the process.’

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘There will always be end-of-year reconciliation due to the way PAYE works. Most people pay the right tax throughout the year, but there will always be a small percentage of the 41 million people in PAYE who have underpayments or overpayments at year end.

‘This could be because they have moved jobs, received a number of different sources of income or received benefits-in-kind that were only reported at the end of the year.’

He added: ‘The effect of Real Time Information is not reflected yet as it has not bedded in but, over time, RTI will help to reduce the number of cases that have to be reconciled. The estimates quoted for reconciliations in 2013-14 are based upon actual numbers in 2012-13.’
