A new study has finally revealed a solid answer to a question that's plagued travelers for decades: when exactly should you book a flight to get it at its cheapest.

And that answer is 54 days prior to departure, according to CheapAir.com.

The tip comes from a study that analyzed over 4 million flights in 2013...and following its advice could save you hundreds on your next domestic flight.

When to buy? A study from CheapAir.com looked at 4 million flights in 2013 and determined the best time to buy a plane ticket is 54 days prior to the flight

While the precise time to buy differs with destination, the compiled data--which looked at 10.5 months of booking time, the earliest most flights allow you to buy--revealed a window that applied to most domestic flights.

CheapAir's study says that the best time to book a domestic flight falls between 104 and 29 days before a flight. Here are the best times to book, in days before the flight, by region.

United States (domestically): 54 days

Mexico: 89 days

Caribbean: 101 days

Latin America: 80 days

Europe: 151 days

Middle East: 80 days

Africa: 166 days

Asia: 129 days

South Pacific: 70 days

Between 104 and 29 days prior to a flight, tickets tend to be at their cheapest.

Buy any earlier than that and risks paying more than you need to. CheapAir says that many travelers make the mistake of buying in the first four months a ticket is available, when prices remain steadily high.

Buy any later and the price is on a steep rise towards the day it hits its peak: the actual day of the flight.

On average, though, it is better to buy too early rather than too late.

According
 to the study, those who booked before the 29-104 day window paid an 
average of $33 more per ticket. Meanwhile, those who booked too late 
paid an average of $73 more per ticket.

Perhaps most importantly, the difference between buying on the cheapest day and the most expensive was an astonishing $312.

It
 must be noted that these findings showed the best time to buy domestic 
flights on average in 2013 and can't predict the exact day to buy every 
flight every single year.

A
 savvy traveler must also consider the popularity of his or her 
destination, the time of year (is it Christmas? Thanksgiving) and the 
availability of flights to the destination (is it a small or large 
airport?).

But following
 the suggestions and sticking to the purchasing window suggested by 
CheapAir is more likely than not to save you at least a little cash.

WHEN TO BOOK EARLIER

When flying on or near a holiday. The study showed that the best time on average to buy a ticket for Christmas or Thanksgiving travel was June 4.

When traveling abroad. While the best time to buy varied with the destination country, it was always earlier than with domestic flights.

When flying someplace popular. Such as a warm, sunny place.

You're flying into a small airport.

You have very specific departure times.

WHEN TO WAIT

When your travel itinerary is flexible.

When you're flying domestically. Compared to international travel, cheaper tickets can be found closer to flight date. This excludes Hawaii.

When you are flying to a large city. Larger cities have more options for airports, airlines, arrival times, etc.

When you're flying at off-peak times. Such as late at night

That time varied with international flights, but the study found the best times to book those as well
