Roberto Martinez wants Everton’s latest European success to be a turning point in their ambition to save their faltering domestic campaign.

Goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku transformed Everton’s Europa League last 16 tie with Dynamo Kiev, giving Martinez’s side a lead to protect in Ukraine next week when it appeared they were set for another night of misery.

Everton have fallen way below expectations in recent months and have only won one Barclays Premier League fixture in 2015 but Martinez is hoping they will carry the momentum from this victory into Sunday’s crucial Goodison Park fixture against Newcastle.

‘It has to be a turning point,’ said Martinez. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team.

‘We need to focus on the league now and get the flow we had in our second half performance. You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know that we have got a good side.’

Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign. He echoed Martinez’s sentiments in hoping for a domestic spin-off.

‘I'm very happy with the team performance,’ said Lukaku. ‘The team reacted well after first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top class players. It's up there with my best performances. Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well.

‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved. Now if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this. We are favourites, but it will be difficult over there.’
