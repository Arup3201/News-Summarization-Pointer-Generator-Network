A daredevil skydiver has broken a world record after jumping out of a plane with the world's smallest parachute - with a canopy less than half the size of a normal device.

Ernesto Gainza made diving history by landing the 35 square foot parachute at the Palm Drop Zone, in Dubai, on Saturday.

While expert sky divers use parachutes that range in size from 80 to 200 square feet, even the smallest of the high-performance canopy sizes developed over the last ten years average between 70 and 90 square feet.

Daredevil skydiver: Ernesto Gainza makes diving history by jumping out of a plane with the world's smallest parachute in Dubai

Jump: Mr Gainza managed to land the 35 square foot parachute at the Palm Drop Zone, in Dubai

Landing: Mr Gainza, a test pilot for NZ Aerosports and Icarus canopies and professional stuntman with more than 7,000 skydives under his belt, required months of training before taking on the challenge

The extreme reduction in size however meant the parachute was at risk of going into a dangerous spin, which can cause an almost instant loss of consciousness.

Mr Gainza, a test pilot for NZ Aerosports and Icarus canopies and professional stuntman with more than 7,000 skydives under his belt, therefore required months of training to ensure he would be able to deal with any situation during the jump.

Mr Gainza said: 'Project  XCF  is  the  product  of  a man's  dream  to  fly and  land  the  world's  smallest parachute.

'Regardless of the size of the challenge, a dream will always be a dream if there is no determination to make it reality.'

The jump was performed under highly experimental conditions and using specially designed prototype equipment.

The previous unofficial record for the smallest parachute landed was held by Luigi Cani who jumped a 37 square foot canopy in 2008.

After completing the jump, Mr Gainza said: 'Many people may look at what I have achieved as a highly risky stunt.

'There has been a full team of highly experienced professionals involved in the execution of this unique and highly dangerous world record and months of preparation went into this.

'I'd like my next adventure to be on the ground now, as I really want to be a father so I will get busy in other ways to make this happen.

'I'm sure my wife doesn't want me to do another stunt like this anytime soon.'
