The Millennial generation is often believed to be more chilled out than Baby Boomers - especially when it comes to travel.

But a new infographic by Chase Card Services suggests otherwise - indicating that luxury and its perks are more important to younger holidaymakers than older ones.

A survey of 1,000 people aged 18-67 reveals that Millennials are more likely than older travellers to seek out hotels with luxury services such as dry cleaning (32 per cent), massage or spa services (30 per cent) and pet-friendliness (23 per cent).

Furthermore, the survey shows Millennial travelers are more likely to say it’s a ‘deal breaker’ if a hotel is not near public transportation (19 per cent).

Sisy Vicente, general manager, Chase Card Services, said: 'Millennials are a tech savvy generation that values social connections, convenience and opportunities to indulge in luxuries.'

'This is a generation of travellers that clearly sees the benefit of travel rewards, such as those that come with Elite status in reward programmes.'
