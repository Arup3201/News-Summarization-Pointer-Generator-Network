Gary Cahill's future at Chelsea is in jeopardy after it emerged that Jose Mourinho is planning to make major changes to his defence next season.

Discussions have already taken place that could shift Branislav Ivanovic into his preferred position at centre back alongside captain John Terry as part of a defensive reshuffle.

Cesar Azpilicueta has been earmarked for a role at right back, also his orthodox position, to finally find room for the £16m left back Filipe Luis in a modified back four. 

Chelsea centre-back Gary Cahill appears to have lost the faith of Blues boss Jose Mourinho 

Although Mourinho insists Terry’s one-year contract extension at Stamford Bridge is ‘a formality’, there will eventually come a time when Chelsea must find a replacement.

Real Madrid’s young centre back Raphael Varane is a longstanding target of Mourinho and Chelsea scouts are watching him as the Portuguese boss prepares to reconfigure his defence in the summer.

Atletico Madrid’s Uruguayan defender Jose Gimenez and Athletic Bilbao centre half Aymeric Laporte are also being monitored.

Mourinho wanted to bring Varane to Chelsea when he returned to Stamford Bridge in July 2013, but Real Madrid have refused to sell the 21-year-old France defender.

The Chelsea manager oversaw his progress at the Bernabeu and he is now a regular in the Real Madrid team alongside the experienced figure of Sergio Ramos.

Jimenez, 20, is regarded as one of the finest young defenders in European football. Laporte, also 20, has won a place in the Bilbao team and is another youngster being watched by Chelsea.

Despite Bilbao’s difficult season in La Liga, the France defender has also gained vital Champions League experience this term.

Mourinho is showing a ruthless streak again and he is determined to make improvements to his defence at the end of the season.

Cahill continued his formidable partnership with Terry in the opening four months of the season, but Mourinho has lost faith in the England defender.

In the absence of Terry, who was rested against Bradford City in the FA Cup, Cahill was expected to take responsibility against Phil Parkinson’s team. But Chelsea were beaten 4-2 and he lost his place to Kurt Zouma for the Capital One Cup tie against Liverpool last Tuesday.

On Saturday, in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City, he came on as an 87th-minute substitute and was asked to play in a holding midfield role to see the game out.

Even then there was frustration from Mourinho on the sidelines when Cahill carelessly conceded possession to set up a City attack in the final moments of the game.

Zouma has surprised Mourinho after his elevation to the first team, but the club are also wary of placing too much expectation on the young defender.
