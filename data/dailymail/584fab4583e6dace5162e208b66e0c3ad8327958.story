At 6pm tonight, Apple boss Tim Cook is set to take to the stage in a San Jose theatre to introduce Apple's latest blockbuster product - a mini tablet set to fend off competition from Amazon’s Kindle Fire and a raft of relatively cheap smaller tablet computers.

The shrunken iPad is rumoured to have a screen that is 7.8inches across the diagonal – which compares to 9.7 on the original version.

Tech watchers suggest the device – like the latest incarnation of the iPhone – will work on the superfast 4G mobile network that will launch next week in the UK.

The mini is thought to be 7.85in diagonally, compared to the 9.7in of the full-size iPad.

This would allow it to be used easily on public transport, and fit into a (large) jacket pocket.

TrustedReviews is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the iPad nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel, not a retina dispaly as seen in the latest iPhone and larger screen iPad

Interest in the new gadget has been huge - with monitoring firm Experian Hitwise saying 1 in every 6000 UK internet searches last week were for the iPad mini.

Piper Jaffray technology analyst Gene Munster said in a note to investors that he expects the iPad mini to launch on 2 November.

The firm believes Apple could sell 5 million iPad minis in the December quarter, but that will be at the expense of 1 million 9.7in iPads.

'For every 5 million smaller iPads, you lose 1 million standard iPads,' Munster wrote.

Apple is said to be planning to charge £200 for the smaller version, which is around half the price of the cheapest iPad 3.

However, it will remain considerably 
more expensive than Amazon’s Kindle Fire, which costs £129, and the 
higher specification Kindle Fire HD, which is £159.

Amazon has suggested it is selling its tablets at a loss in order to get it into the hands of families.

The idea is that it can then cash in through sales of a vast library of books, music, films and TV programmes.

Apple’s innovative phones, tablets 
and computers have always come with a hefty price premium, while its 
rise to become the world’s most valuable company has been fuelled by 
sales through its vast iTunes store.

Jason Jenkins, the editor of CNET UK, 
said: ‘If the leaks are correct, we can expect Apple to announce an iPad
mini that’s more like a shrunk-down iPad 2 than an iPad 3.

‘It should have a 7.8-inch screen with
a resolution of 1024 x 768. It will have the new, smaller Lightning 
port seen on the iPhone 5, which means you’ll need to buy a converter to
plug it into any equipment that uses the old-style, large Apple plug.

‘I am expecting it to come in around 
the £200 mark, which would enable Apple to compete with the avalanche of
cheap tablets appearing in the shops from Google, Amazon and others.

‘With Amazon selling a 7-inch tablet 
for just £129, though, Apple is going to going to have a real fight on 
its hands as it attempt to dominate the tablet market in Europe in the 
way it has until now.’

It is thought that Apple will also launch a tweaked version of the iPad 3 that works on the UK’s 4G network.

Apple's yet-to-be-announced iPad 
Mini has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best
set of pictures yet leaked on the internet.

Sonny
Dickson, a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com, published the images on 
his Twitter feed last week, sparking a wave of excitement among Apple 
enthusiasts.

The images (above and below) show
a device that is significantly smaller than the regular iPad.

According
to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display, making it a rival
to Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire.

The images also show the iPad Mini 
utilises the controversial new connector introduced with the iPhone 5, 
which has made all accessories available to previous Apple gadgets 
obsolete at a stroke.

It emerged yesterday that Apple had 
instructed suppliers in China to manufacture 10million of the new 
smaller tablet computers, showing faith in their product in the face of 
stiff competition.

Insiders 
say the iPad Mini will be announced on October 17, a few days from the 
releases of Amazon's Kindle Fire and Microsoft's Surface tablets, and go
on sale November 2.

As yet, however, Apple has not officially confirmed any of the reports, rumours of leaks about a smaller iPad.

Apple's 9-inch device dominates the 
market, but smaller, cheaper tablets have been eating away at the iPad's
popularity.

The launch comes in a week of hi-tech product releases.

Amazon has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated 
Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time 
on the 25th October.

The gadgets, are available in both 
7-inch and 8.9-inch versions (although only the 7-inch version is 
currently set to go o sale outside of the US).

Microsoft is also launching its Surface tablets on the 26th, when Google is also believed to be revealing new tablets and software.

 

The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per 
cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing 
someone else's tablet for web browsing.

About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year.

The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of
cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening
Apple's grip on the market.

A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent.

The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent.

Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a 
smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an 
iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry.

Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival.

'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.'

However,
devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that 
there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public 
transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini'
with a 7 or 8 inch screen.
