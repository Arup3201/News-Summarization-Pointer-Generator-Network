Rescuers were left horrified at the facial injuries of a blood-soaked woman - only to discover she was wearing 'zombie make-up'.

Tracy Morgan, 37, was on a fancy dress weekend dressed as one of the undead - complete with gruesome face paint -  when she fell 15ft down a cliff on a remote island in Wales.

The horror film fan, who was taking part in a  'Zombie Survival Weekender' had to be rescued by coastguards, who were convinced she would need plastic surgery.

But despite her appearance - which saw her made-up to seem as if chunks of flesh were falling from her face - she was not seriously injured.

'This weekends birthday event was unfortunately cut short on the first of our two nights of Pirates vs Zombies adventure when our most highly decorated marshal bravely swallow dived from a cliff and dashed her head on the rocks below.

'Tracy was airlifted from the island 
and we met her at hospital. She had her head glued and other than a 
cracked rib and some bruising she will be fine.

'Tracy is very lucky to have gotten off so lightly. I hope she has a speedy recovery.'
