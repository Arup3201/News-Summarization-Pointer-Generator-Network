The creator of Flappy Bird is set to release a follow-up game which looks just as addictive - and infuriating - as his first hit game.

Swing Copters will be available to download from Thursday from Apple’s App Store.

The game, created by Dong Nguyen, looks like its predecessor but instead features a man with a helicopter helmet, who must dodge gates and swinging hammers in order to survive.

The creator of hit game Flappy Bird is set to release a follow-up game called Swing Copters (pictured) which looks just as addictive - and infuriating - as his first hit

It will be free to download with a $0.99 (69p) charge to remove adverts, TouchArcade reported. 

A journalist at the publication said the game is ‘hard,’ and that players have to tap a smartphone screen to keep their character airborne and move him left and right.

The aim of the game is to fly through gates - just like in Flappy Bird - except they are arranged vertically so the pilot wants to get as high as possible, while avoiding swinging hammers.

Players score a point for every obstacle the pilot successfully passes.

Mr Nguyen, a 28-year-old Vietnam-based developer, has a tough act to follow. 

His first game, Flappy Bird, was the most downloaded game in the App Store in January 2014 with more than 50 million players.

Dong Nguyen's first game - Flappy Bird - was the most downloaded game in the App Store in January 2014 with 50 million players.

A month later he announced that he was pulling it.

He told Forbes that his decision was based on the game being an addictive product.

'To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever,' he said.

However, after a glut of copy-cat games flooded app stores, the developer re-launched the original game.

He is now about to release his second title - Swing Copters - which is a similar design and features similar game play.

Critics may argue that the developer's move of pulling his first game, was more of a press stunt than altruistic.

A month after his success, Mr Nguyen pulled the game because it ruined his ‘simple life’ and he announced on Twitter: ‘I'm sorry Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this anymore.’

The developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $50,000 (£30,000) every day in in-app advertising alone.

He seemingly pulled the game from various app stores for altruistic and personal reasons.

In February he told Forbes: 'It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem.

'To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.’

A glut of copy-cat games were developed to fill Flappy Bird’s space and fans of the game were willing to go to extremes to keep on playing it.

Phones pre-loaded with the hit were listed for as much as $20,000 (£13,000) on eBay just after the game disappeared and Mr Nguyen reportedly received death threats to bring it back.

In a change of heart, Mr Nguyen released an official new version called Flappy Birds Family exclusively on Android’s store last month.

And it now appears that the developer has put his qualms about addictive games to bed with the impending launch of his latest offering.

While the game is set to launch on the App Store, Mr Nguyen announced on Twitter that there will be an Android version too.
