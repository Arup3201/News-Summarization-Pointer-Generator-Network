Stevan Jovetic believes Manchester City have the most competitive squad in the world but is determined to make his mark on the team this season.

City spent around £22million to sign Jovetic from Fiorentina last summer but the Montenegro forward endured a stuttering debut campaign at the Etihad Stadium.

Edged out of the starting line-up by the likes of Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo, the 24-year-old was also held back by injuries as he started just five matches in all competitions.

Impact: Stevan Jovetic is determined to make his mark at Manchester City this season

Battle: He faces a fight to get ahead of Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo in pecking order

Struggle: The forward had a difficult start to life at the club, starting just five games last season

'Everybody knows that when they come to City, they have to compete in the biggest squad in the world,' Jovetic said.

'Especially in attack - we have five very good strikers and we know it is not easy to play every game.'

Jovetic continued: 'When I played last season, it was good but I was just injured a lot of the time so I was always behind with the conditioning.

'That was the number one problem but in the final three or four months, it was fine and I was playing.

'This year it is going to be better.'

City completed the signing of Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala on Monday to take the club's summer spending to around £50m with Fernando, Willy Caballero, Frank Lampard and Bacary Sagna also arriving.

So far, however, the champions' transfer dealings have arguably been trumped by both Chelsea and Arsenal while Manchester United are expected to enjoy a resurgence under Louis Van Gaal.

'This year is going to be more difficult than last year,' Jovetic said.

'Man United will be much better than last year, Arsenal are stronger, Chelsea with the three or four players they have bought, will be better.

'Liverpool are also good - they are strong now and if they buy some strikers, they will also be in the race for the title.

'I expect a really tough season but we need to believe in ourselves and hopefully we are going to win the league again.'

City were well below par as Arsenal recorded a 3-0 victory in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.

'It is better this defeat happened now rather than later but we need to learn from this," Jovetic said after the match.

'We need to learn from our mistakes and watch the next game - we have one week more and players will be coming back.

'We need to win the next one against Newcastle, which will be tough.'
