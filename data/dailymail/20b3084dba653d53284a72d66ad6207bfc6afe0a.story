Health scare: Rick Parfitt, 65, has been hospitalised in Pula, north Croatia, forcing Status Quo to cancel their gig and the next six hours ahead of performing

Status Quo have been forced to cancel their European tour hours before taking to the stage after guitarist Rick Parfitt was taken ill in Croatia.

The band, known for hits such as Whatever You Want and Rockin' All Over The World, had been due to play in the northern city of Pula tonight.

But just hours ahead of their performance, they have been forced to cancel the show - and the following six.

Parfitt, 65, who had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, was forced to cancel a series of shows nine years ago to have tests for suspected throat cancer.

He has since spoken of his concern that he 'will not live to see my children grow up'.

But he maintained that he would not become a 'born-against Christian', embarking on a 32-show tour.

Little has been disclosed about the nature of Parfitt's condition today, although a spokesman said the band will release more information on his condition when it is known next week.

The band's manager Simon Porter said: 'The band do not cancel shows lightly, as any of our fans will tell you, but in this instance we have no option but to follow medical advice.' 

It is not known whether or not the band's UK tour, scheduled for December, will be affected.

The band's dates in Monte Carlo, Switzerland and Germany - up until August 10 - have been cancelled on medical advice. 

Within minutes of the statement being issued, fans from all over the world were flooding forums, Twitter and the official Facebook page with messages of concern.

Many were consulting photos of him at their latest gig in Austria, remarking that he looked 'tired'. 

One wrote on a forum: 'Always makes me nervous reading stuff life this, hope he's ok', while another said: 'All the best from me. I saw you play when you cam to Swindon in 1990.'

And one well-wisher said: 'Hope he will bounce back like he has in the past. Get well soon Rick.'

Some fans speculated he may be suffering from sunstroke or heat exhaustion in the summer heat wave across mainland Europe.

On the band's Facebook page, a fan wrote: 'Get well soon Rick! Best wishes from Argentina!'

Fan: Sally Newhouse said: 'Get well quick #RickParfitt - #StatusQuo and the world of #rock #music needs you'

Another said: 'Every good wish to you, yours and the band. Health must come first, hope to see you fit and well in Leeds'.

Fans also took to Twitter this afternoon to express their concern for the guitarist's wellbeing.

User Johnny Main wrote: 'Not good news. Hope it's nothing serious', while Sally Newhouse said: 'Get well quick #RickParfitt - #StatusQuo and the world of #rock #music needs you.'

Another user simply wrote: 'Terrible news.'

In 1997,  doctors warned Parfitt that he could die at any time following a hard-living lifestyle involving drink and drugs.

Parfitt says that he is still able to perform for hours but struggles to keep up with his son playing football

Chris Smith wrote: 'Love and best wishes to Rick #StatusQuo for a speedy recovery. Keep on rocking Rick and get back on stage soon to wow us as you always do'

Even after the life-saving surgery, the guitarist said he still enjoyed the 'odd pint'. 

But after his scares, he insists he now never spends more than three weeks away from his family while touring with the band in order to spend as much time with his children as possible.

His 54-year-old wife Lyndsay underwent gruelling IVF treatment in order to become pregnant five years ago, and they now have twins Tommy and Lily.

Speaking to the Mail last November, he said: ‘It upsets me to think that I won’t see them fully grow up.

'I probably won’t. Even if I live to 80, they will just about be 20. I would love to see them get to 21.

Family: Parfitt never spends more than three weeks away from wife Lyndsay and their five-year-old sons

Still performing: The rock band, pictured in the 1960s, were due to kick off a 32-date tour with their Croatia gig tonight. Despite having a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, Parfitt (second left) vowed to enjoy himself

‘It frightens the life out of me when I think I’m not going to see them grow up, and to see what they do and what they become. 

'I know it’s morbid, but I’m only being realistic. I won’t be around.

‘That really scares me. I’m going to try and do as much as I can. 

'I’m going to travel with them and take them to Disneyland.

'I want to be able to see their faces when they see that sort of thing. And just be with them as much as I can. I won’t go away for more than three weeks now.’

Status Quo currently hold the record for the most British singles, at 64.
