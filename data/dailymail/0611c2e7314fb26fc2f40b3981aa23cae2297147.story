A group of children in Yemen have attempted to burn a 10-year-old boy to death after first locking him in a cage in a shocking imitation of the Islamic State's murder of a Jordanian pilot.

As many as seven boys are believed to have attacked the as-yet unnamed victim in Al Dahthath village in the country's northern Ibb province.

The defenceless child was then locked in a wooden cage and had petrol poured over his body before being set alight. Thankfully a group of locals spotted the attack and managed to save the boy's life, although he was still left with horrific burn injuries on his legs.

Gruesome: The attack is understood to have been a sickening imitation of the brutal murder of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kasasbeh, who was burnt alive by ISIS earlier this year

Local journalist Mohammad Mouzahem was told about the attack and posted details of it on his Facebook page, according to Gulf News.

The boys are understood to have been inspired by murders committed by ISIS after using mobile phone apps such as WhatsApp to share gruesome videos of the terror group's atrocities, despite living in a remote village where electricity supplies are unreliable.

During the attack, the boys are said to have assumed different terrorist roles, with the 'leader' sitting in a chair and giving orders to his friends.

After being set alight, the boys cries were overheard by local residents who rushed to save him.

'The villagers took him to a local hospital where he received treatment for burns to one of his legs,' Mr Mouzahem was quoted as saying.

Shame: The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the caged airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to him is seen being set alight

The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the caged airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars is seen being set alight.

Flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage, where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish.

Extremists pour debris, including broken masonry, over the cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer.

The horrific murder led to Jordan immediately executing two ISIS prisoners and carrying out an unprecedented number of attacks on the terror group in Syria.

Lined up on the beach: The group of young boys in Yemen are forced to their knees and stare down at the sand whilst they await their mock execution

Chilling: The video bares a striking resemblance to ISIS' real murder video of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya and suggests the young boys have been studying the footage intently

Sickening: The video in Yemen shows five young boys, aged around 10-years-old and wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenagers

The real thing: Each boy appears deep in character, honed from studying the authentic Coptic murder video

News of the attack on the 10-year-old boy in Yemen came just weeks after video emerged showing a group of young Yemeni boys reenacting the brutal murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State militants in Libya.

The grainy mobile phone footage was reportedly filmed somewhere on the Gulf coast in Yemen.

It shows five young boys, possibly aged around 10-years-old, wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenage boys.

The teenage boys are fully dressed and their faces are covered by scarfs to imitate the masked murderers from the sickening Islamic State execution video.

On the way to the beach, the older boys each pick up a stick, mimicking the collecting of knives by the executioners in the beheading video of 21 Syrian soldiers released in November 2014.

An Egyptian couple horrified guests at their wedding by hiring fake jihadis to  hijack the ceremony and force them in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot.

The marriage ceremony was held in Menoufia, north of Cairo and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point.

The only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend 'attack' in advance were the groom, his best men and wedding photographer Ahmed Kassem - although the bride is said to have been told to expect something 'different' from the ceremony.

Trapped: The fake jihadis took control of the ceremony and force the bride and groom in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot

It is unclear from the video whether the bride and groom are Muslim or Christian.

Video footage of the ceremony shows one of the groom's knife-wielding best men wearing a black balaclava and  religious song - known as a nasheed - that has previously featured prominently in genuine Islamic State propaganda videos.

Having stormed the stage, the men force the couple to climb in to a cage in a chilling imitation of the ISIS video that showed Jordanian pilot Mu'ath Al Kassasbeh being burnt alive earlier this year.

The only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend 'attack' in advance were the as yet unnamed groom, his best men and wedding photographer Ahmed Kassem. The bride was not aware

Once inside the cage the couple stand up and dance while guests clap and cheer them on.

Not everybody was enamoured by the proceedings, however, with the Youm7 newspaper reporting that several of the wedding guests mistakenly thought it was a genuine terrorist attack.

It is believed that even the bride was unaware at what the groom had planned, and that the only people aware of the 'attack' in advance were the best men playing the roles of jihadis, and the photographer, who had been ordered to make sure everything was caught on camera.
