The new governor of the Bank of England will be given a housing allowance of £250,000 a year, pushing his total annual earnings towards £1million.

Canadian Mark Carney, who takes over from Sir Mervyn King on July 1, will get the extra cash on top of pay and perks worth £624,000.

It takes his total annual package before tax to £874,000 – six times more than the £142,500 Prime Minister David Cameron is paid and 33 times the national average of £26,000 a year.

The one-off cost of moving Mr Carney and his family to Britain has yet to be finalised and will also be covered by the taxpayer.

The housing allowance – agreed in 
secret before Mr Carney was appointed last month but only made public 
yesterday – will contribute towards a five-bedroom home for his wife and
 four young daughters in central London.

The deal was a crucial part of the 
effort to tempt the 47-year-old to leave his job as governor of the Bank
 of Canada and move his family to Britain.

Mr Carney, hailed as ‘the outstanding 
central banker of his generation’ by George Osborne, currently lives in a
 spacious family home near the Bank of Canada headquarters in Ottawa.

But the housing deal – worth 
£1.25million over his five years as governor and enough to cover rent of
 £2,500 a week after tax – will alarm MPs when many households are 
struggling to make ends meet. The Canadian – the first foreigner to run 
the Bank of England since it was set up in 1694 – insisted on serving 
for just five years instead of eight and will earn far more than Sir 
Mervyn’s £305,000 a year.

Outgoing: Sir Mervyn King, who will stand down as Governor in June next year, is on a considerably lower salary than Mr Carney

It is also thought that Mr  Carney has
 political ambitions and even thought about running for Prime Minister 
in his homeland before accepting the Bank of England job.

The Canadian now faces a showdown with
 MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in February in what will be his 
first public outing in Britain since his appointment.

‘Colleagues will want to ask about 
every aspect of his appointment including, no doubt, remuneration,’ said
 Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the powerful committee of MPs.

Adam Posen, a former member of the 
monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, has warned that Mr 
Carney’s generous pay and perks means he could be seen as a ‘globe- 
trotting corporate free agent’.

The package was signed off yesterday 
by the non-executive directors at the Bank of England – a group which 
includes chairman Sir David Lees, Sir Roger Carr, chairman of British 
Gas owner Centrica, and Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison.

Mr Carney will get a basic salary of 
£480,000, a cash allowance in lieu of pension of £144,000, and the 
£250,000 a year housing allowance – a total of £874,000.

John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury
 Select Committee, said: ‘I think even by MPs’ standards it is a 
remarkable amount of money to live on in London.

‘It is just comical that level of money.’

Mr Carney, who faces a UK tax bill of around £400,000 a year, has a British wife and intends to apply for British citizenship.

The pay of fellow Canadian Moya 
Greene, who runs Royal Mail and last year earned a total package worth 
£1.1million, has also caused outrage.

Although she gets perks such as two return flights to Canada each year, she does not get a housing allowance.

After tax, Mark Carney will have a monthly housing allowance of £11,500 for his wife and four daughters. Here are some of the London properties he could rent: 

Mr Carney could set up home in this beautiful seven-bedroom, regency period house and still have £2,000 each month to spare.

The Grade II listed townhouse, which costs £9,500 a month, is located in leafy Blackheath, south east London, and even has its own swimming pool.

Affordable: This seven bedroom home in Blackheath is well within his budget

For just slightly over budget (£11,917pcm), the Carneys could live in the heart of London in this magnificent five bedroom house just a stone’s throw from Parliament Square, Buckingham Palace and St. James’ Park.

Luxurious: A bit over budget, but it's walking distance to Parliament

If the Carney family fancy rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, they could rent this five-bed apartment in trendy St John’s Wood - a popular haunt of celebrities including Sir Paul McCartney and Kate Moss.

Furthermore, the property, which costs £10,834-a-month, is located on Abbey Road, close to the studios and zebra crossing made famous by the Beatles.

For £8,667-a-month, Mr Carney could opt for this five-bed family home, located close to picturesque Hampstead Heath, one of the most sought-after areas of London.

Location: This five bedroom house is in sought-after Beaumont Gardens in Hampstead

If Mr Carney wants to live within walking distance of the Bank of England, then he could chose this £10,000-a-month 18th century townhouse, which comes complete with a retractable glass room and contemporary internal ‘living wall’ of plants.

Desirable: Mr Carney might like this 18th century townhouse in Queen Anne's Gate
