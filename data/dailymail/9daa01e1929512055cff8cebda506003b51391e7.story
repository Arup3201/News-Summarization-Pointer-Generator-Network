Ann Scognomillo, 56, was diagnosed with melanoma four years ago. Out of her six siblings, she is one in four who has developed the deadly skin cancer

It is a cancer that kills around 2,000 Australians each year, but prevention can be as simple as checking your skin and being aware of any significant changes.

Now, a new study has revealed the risk of melanoma can quadruple if moles on your skin are present.

Thankfully, Ann Scognomillo, a 56 year-old mother of two, was one of the lucky 11,000 Australians diagnosed with skin cancer each year, who has lived to tell her story.

Originally misdiagnosed with psoriasis by her GP in the '80s, Ms Scognomillo's skin condition continued to worsen, with up to 16 dry-skin patches increasingly forming over her body.

It was not until 20 years of incorrect treatment, that Ann sought a second opinion with Professor Rodney Sinclair, Director at Sinclair Dermatology, who told her she was actually suffering from Bowen's disease, an early form of skin cancer that appears as a continual, slow-growing, red and scaly skin patch.

Aware of her risk to skin cancer, three out of her six siblings had developed melanoma, Ann was pedantic at checking for abnormalities, and four years ago she became the fourth sibling diagnosed with melanoma.

'I was worried because you don't know the degree of it but I am also pretty cluey with skin.

'I felt a lump on my fore-arm, it started off as a brown spot and after a couple of months it separated so I went straight to Rodney and he took a biopsy,' Ann told Daily Mail Australia.

A few days later Ann received a call from Professor Rodney and was told to come straight back to the clinic to remove the melanoma.

'It made me panic but i felt it would be OK because the markings has only been on my skin for four months, so I got it early enough.

'If I had left it who knows where I'd be today,' Ann said.

Ann discovered an unusual marking on her daughter Kate, 33 just after giving birth to her first child. Kate was diagnosed with melanoma in May 2010 and underwent surgery for removal

Ann describes her mother as being before her time, she said she diligently applying sunscreen to her and her siblings everyday, but unfortunately that did not prevent four out of six of them from developing skin cancer.

She said the family are fair skinned, with quite a bit of moles covering their bodies.

'Out of the four of us who got melanoma, three of us have fair skin, two red heads but funnily-enough one brother has more of an olive pigment.'

Ann's awareness of skin and the risks of cancer did not only save her life, but her daughter's Kate, aged 33.

'After my daughter had her first baby in 2010, I noticed a mark on her arm, which confirmed to be melanoma.'

When asked how her interest in skin and checking for skin cancers came about, Ann said it was something she had always been aware of from a very early age.

'Even though I baked myself out in the sun with coconut oil, going brown as a berry, I was always interested in skin care and my sister is a beauty therapist, so it naturally followed from there.

'The awareness and knowledge about skin cancer is part of every day life and there is so much more out there these days.'

Ann now goes for check-ups every 6 months and is incredibly grateful for Professor Sinclair and the studies that are being conducted.

'I think Rodney is doing a wonderful job.

'Before him I had skin cancer all over my body that I thought was psoriasis. I have confidence in him and we are very fortunate to have people like that in Melbourne.'

For Professor Sinclair, a world leader in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment, the results were shocking, as patients with moles were 4.6 times more likely to develop skin cancer, compared to the previous misconception that the risk only doubled if benign or unusual moles are present.

The case-link study, conducted by the University of Melbourne, University of Oxord and the Epworth Healthcare, compared the medical records of two groups of people - 271,656 for who had moles checked during a hospital visit for any condition, and 10,130,417 who did not have moles recorded. 

'Patients go in for a check-up and some are told everything is alright but the people who have self-identified as having moles and has been assessed, are the ones who need to be very mindful and make sure they are going for regular examinations,' Professor Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia.

Despite these significant findings, Professor Sinclair believes vigilance is key and fatality can be prevented.

'Melanoma has improved - the success rate has jumped from 80 per cent to 90 per cent, that means 9 out of 10 people can expect to be cured at the time of removal.

'But for 10 per cent of people, the melanoma would end up spreading to other organs, called metastases spread.'

He says patients who have metastases spread, considered as Stage 4, has a 25 per cent chance of surviving a year, and only 2 per cent chance of a two year survival.

Acral lentiginous melanoma is a fare melanoma usually found on the palms, soles, under the nails and in the oral mucosa

Although melanoma is the least common cancer, it is also the most serious type of skin cancers, with Australia having one of the highest rates in the world.

Professor Sinclair puts this down to Australia being closer to the equator and a population of European settlers.

'The Indigenous Australians have a very low risk of melanoma because of the protection provided by their skin pigmentation, but the northern Europeans, people with blue eyes, fair skin and red hair are at an increased risk since moving to Australia.

'A very good study that was done years ago showed that people who moved to Australia before the age of 15 would see their risk increase dramatically.'

He explains in Victoria, the base line risk of melanoma is 3 per cent, compared to a 10 per cent rise in Queensland, where people typically spend more time outdoors and see more sun. 

But despite somber figures, the new study reveals can be taken in a positive light that skin cancer can successfully be treated if people take responsibility and diligently check their skin.

'People who have a history of moles and have had check-ups need to look out for new moles.

'For children up to the age of 15 or 16 it is normal to develop new ones, but if you have a mole with undergoing change, shape or colour or even something on you skin that bothers you, that's an indication that you should get your skin checked.'

Nodular melanoma

When melanoma develops in a pre-existing mole, there is usually:

*an area of colour change

*growth

*change in colour

*or even a new mole develops in an adult

He also describes the 'ugly duckling phenomenon':

*if there is something on your skin that bothers you or makes you feel uneasy

Professor Sinclair recommends seeing a doctor after 4-6 weeks if you notice the 'ugly duckling phenomenon' on your skin
