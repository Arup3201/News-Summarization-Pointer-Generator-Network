These dogs are really making a splash.

Despite the combination of smells of wet dog and chlorine would make most people recoil, the joy of these diving dogs playing in the pool is enough the get anyone to simply hold their breath.

These fluffy champs all took part in a dog diving competition in the Hungarian capital of Budapest this weekend.

Get in: Nothing could stop this Golden Retriever once it spotted the toy in the water during the competition in the Hungarian capital on Sunday

Water dog: Although the smell of chlorine and wet dog can hardly be described as pleasant - the sight of this happy dog definitely is

One thing on his mind: This dog only sees the water between him and the toy as a challenge

Dog diving is set to test the 'fetch' skills of the dogs in water - and presumably how they get in.

The unusual competition sees the owner throw a toy into the pool and the dog jumps into the water to retrieve it.

The competition has a particular set of rules, including no forced jumps.

It
 is strictly forbidden for owners to pick up their dogs and throw them 
into the water and if the dog refuses to 'dive' it is out of the comp.

This pet had the time of its life, jumping into the pool to retrieve the plastic toy thrown in by its owner

'You could've told me!': Even though all the dogs went in by free will, this one looks like it just discovered that the water was both wet and cold

One way to wash 'em: Dog diving is tests the skill of the dogs, and the pets must 'bathe' voluntarily

Go fetch: A dog makes its way back to its owner with a tennis ball in its mouth as it participates in a dog diving competition in Budapest

Safety first: The dog diving competition in Budapest came with an unusual rule - no dogs could be physically thrown into the water
