Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has challenged summer signing Remy Cabella to take over Yohan Cabaye's mantle as a match-winner.

The 24-year-old France international was a target for the Magpies in the immediate aftermath of Cabaye's £19million departure for Paris St Germain in January, but they could not strike a deal with his club Montpellier at the time.

However, their patience was rewarded last month when they finally got their man in a £7m swoop, and the newcomer showed flashes of his talent in last Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to champions Manchester City.

Replacement: Pardew believes Cabella can fill the void left by Yohan Cabaye's departure in January

Cabella is by no means a direct replacement for midfield schemer Cabaye, but he possesses similar star quality, and Pardew is hoping he and fellow newcomers Siem de Jong and Emmanuel Riviere can provide the flair and potency the club so clearly lacked during the second half of last season.

The 53-year-old said: 'They are different players. What Remy does in terms of great moments in the game, he can create them - obviously Cabaye could do that, so there's a similarity in that.

'You need a framework for those players and a platform to win games. Now we need the other side of it, that special quality that Cabaye gave us, that Demba Ba gave, Loic Remy gave us.

'Cabella is very much a replacement for one of those three names, and De Jong and Riviere and Facundo (Ferreyra) and Rolando (Aarons) and Ayoze (Perez), who came on and produced a nice cameo, have got to ring the same bell a those other players.'

Cabella and his team-mates - De Jong could be handed a Barclays Premier League debut for the club this weekend after shaking off a foot injury - will attempt to open their account for the season at Aston Villa on Saturday following a creditable display in defeat to City.

Poise: Cabella showed some nice touches during his debut for Newcastle against Manchester City

Newcastle might have snatched a point had in not been for a stunning last-gasp intervention by Fernando to deny substitute Perez a late equalizer and Sergio Aguero's injury-time strike, and Pardew and his players have taken the positives from that performance.

The manager said: 'We are in good shape. The feeling in the local media and press and among our fans is one of optimism.

'That's felt on the training ground as well. It's felt by my staff - and some of my staff have been here for 25 years.

'There's a genuine feeling we have got a decent side here, and I think we need a couple of results under our belt and then we will see how quickly it grows.

'There are a lot of new players, though. Someone said to me, are we carrying a bit of negative history for last season, but only half the team were playing. The other 50 per cent are new.'

Four of the men who started last weekend's game - Daryl Janmaat, Jack Colback, Cabella and Riviere - were making debuts, and De Jong's inclusion this weekend would further enhance that new look.

While that creates its own challenges, Pardew admits significant change was required and has been delighted with the way owner Mike Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley have responded to his pleas.

He said: 'That really helps lift the players who were here last year. That's massive, I think, when you have had a disappointing season and the disappointment on the back of Cabaye's departure.

'One of the points I have made to Mike and Lee, it's important for new players to come in quickly. We did that and I'm pleased with that.'
