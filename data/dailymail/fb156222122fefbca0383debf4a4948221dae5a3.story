She already boasts an e-boutique and sells in luxury stores all over the world but it seems that's not enough for Victoria Beckham.

The designer has announced that she is to launch her first standalone store, which will open in London's Dover Street in the autumn.

Along with her main collection, the new boutique will also house sister range Victoria Victoria Beckham, as well as accessories and denim.

Speaking to Women's Wear Daily, Beckham revealed that customers visiting the store would get an insight into the brand and the design process.

'I think the time is now because I know my customer,' she explained. 'It will be the first time that the people will really be able to see the brand through my eyes.'

The interior of the 7000 square foot space will be given a new look by architect Farshid Moussavi, whose credits include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland.

Plans include drilling a hole through the middle of the building to link the boutique's three floors and creating a conceptual interior.

'[Moussavi] is a woman who loves fashion as well,' she added. 'She has quite a conceptual eye, which I like.

'We want to make something different without making it overly complicated. I just want it to feel real for me.'

And it seems that Mrs Beckham's plans don't start and finish in London. According to reports in British Vogue, the designer also plans to open an office in New York.

The new space, in the Big Apple's elegant Chelsea district, will open next month to cater to the needs of American clients, Beckham's biggest market after the UK.

She added: 'I'm taking my business very seriously... To take it to the next level, I need a team on the ground living and breathing everything here in America.'
