Police have confirmed that the body found in a river near York is that of missing student Megan Roberts, who disappeared on a night out.

A member of the public discovered the body on a muddy river bank, five weeks after she disappeared.

Miss Roberts, 20, had been out with friends in York on the evening of January 23 and it was feared that she fell into the River Ouse which runs through the city, without them noticing.

Police launched a massive hunt for the student, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, but could find no trace of her.

It
 was then feared that she had fallen in the river near the city's Lendal
 Bridge after leaving the Popworld club with her friends.

The banks of the river were searched and divers were used to try and find her.

A
 body was found on Sunday afternoon at Acaster Malbis, five miles from 
where she disappeared and it was confirmed today, that it was that of 
Miss Roberts.

It had earlier been announced that a woman's body has been recovered from the River Ouse near the Ship Inn in Acaster Malbis, pictured

Superintendent
 Phil Cain, Safer Neighbourhood Commander for York , said: 'Our thoughts
 and sympathies are with Megan's family at this extremely difficult and 
very sad time.

'Her family are receiving support from specially trained officers as they come to terms with what has happened.

She was described as an intelligent, talented and beautiful person whose kindness and sense of humour will be greatly missed by everyone

'This
 tragedy has touched many people including Megan's friends, fellow 
students at York St John University and the people of York and we extend
 our sympathies to them at this time.

'I
 hope that a small measure of comfort can be taken from the fact that 
Megan has now been found, albeit in the most tragic of circumstances, 
putting an end to the uncertainty about where she is and allowing her 
family and friends to grieve properly for her.

'I
 would like to thank the Missing People charity for their invaluable 
help and support during the investigation, and to members of the public 
and the residents of York who have phoned into the enquiry with 
information, their support is greatly appreciated.'

After
 her daughter's body was identified Miss Roberts's mother, Jackie, said 
in a statement: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service, and 
the public that have been involved in the search for Megan.

'We would 
also like to thank everyone who has offered support and comfort during 
this painful time.

'Megan 
was an intelligent, talented and beautiful person whose kindness and 
sense of humour will be greatly missed by everyone who knew and loved 
her.'

The student's father 
Jason Roberts said: 'We would like to thank the police, fire service and
 the public who have been involved in the search for Megan.

'Megan was a wonderful, kind and loving daughter who will be missed by many.'
