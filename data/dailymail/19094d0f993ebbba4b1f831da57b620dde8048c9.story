Jeff Knight could be accused of straying from home - but things are actually going great with his girlfriend. 

Knight, the director of connected clients and a 'founding engineer' of Facebook dating service Zoosk, met Google employee Sara Pelosi on rival site OKCupid.

As their romance blossomed she detailed their courtship on her blog.

Social-network-crossed lovers: Jeff Knight, an executive of dating site Zoosk, started dating his current girlfriend Sara Pelosi, pictured above, after meeting her on competition site OkCupid

Before going steady with Knight, Pelosi wrote a blog about online dating called 'Looking for Love in Online Places'.

She ended the blog earlier this month with a post about making it 'Facebook official' with Knight.

In the post she recounts how the two met on OKCupid, even though Knight works for Zoosk.

When they were first corresponding on OKCupid, she asked him which social network he worked at.

When Jeff met Sara: Knight was upfront with Pelosi about where he worked, and assured her he was not using the site to do research on the competition

'That's actually a very funny story' he wrote before admitting he worked for another dating site.

'He was completely upfront about it so I asked if he was doing research or actually supporting a competitor,' Pelosi said. 'To this he replied, he was actually using OKCupid for its intended purpose.'

She says she was skeptical about the story, but agreed to a date anyway figuring she could get a blog post out of it.

The following eight dates were a success and now the two are officially dating.

Zoosk has since issued a statement about their employee policy. Apparently Knight is one of the few employees not allowed to use the site because he has access to user data. This policy was enacted to protect members.

According to Gawker's Valleywag blog, the company has raised millions in  venture capitol but still hasn't risen to the 'heights' of OKCupid, Match or eHarmony.

However, Zoosk does have the number one rated dating app.
