Royal Mail boss Moya Greene suffered a humiliating blow after a watchdog rubbished claims that Britain’s six-day-a-week postal service was under threat.

Ofcom said evidence failed to support ‘pessimistic’ claims by Royal Mail that increased competition from rivals would put the national delivery service at risk.

The regulator refused to restrict competitors, and instead turned the tables, announcing a review into Royal Mail’s efficiency. Shares in the firm fell 3 per cent within hours of yesterday’s announcement.

It revealed it would not impose new conditions on Royal Mail's  competitors like Amazon and TNT, in a blow to the postal service.

Royal Mail was dealt a fresh blow after regulator Ofcom said it would not impose new conditions on the firm's direct-delivery competitors

Business Secretary Vince Cable hit back at claims from Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, that the the universal delivery service was being threatened by rival firms taking lucrative work in big cities

It came after Vince Cable last week warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering'.

The Business Secretary said the firm - part-owned by the taxpayer - must stop 'whinging' about competition from rival companies 'cherry-picking' the delivery of letters and parcels in high density areas.

It comes after Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, told MPs that the 'precious' universal service obligation is under threat with competitors undermining her firm's economics.

Last month profits in Royal Mail slumped after Amazon shook up the parcels market by setting up its own delivery network. Royal Mail profits fell from £353 million to £279 million.

The universal service obligation cost £7.2 billion a year because of the high cost of delivering post to rural and remote areas of the UK.

Giving evidence to the business select committee, Ms Greene said: 'The universal service is a precious service. It its essential for most people in Britain and it has a fixed cost.'

She said: 'It requires a number of internal subsidies in order to make the economics work.

'So for example, the low cost urban areas are needed - and mail that's high density and high volume mail are needed - to cross-subsidise the suburban and rural areas which are much higher cost.

'If you allow cherry-picking in urban areas you undermine the economics. It siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue. It makes the universal service uneconomic.

'Unlike many universal services in the world, we do not require or rely on government subsidy.'

But Ofcom said that competition from rivals will make the postal service more efficient.

Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said today: ‘Ofcom's board has considered all the evidence in the postal market carefully over the past few months. We have concluded that there is no present risk to the financial sustainability of the universal service.’

Rivals Whistl and UK Mail deny they are cherry-picking work, or that they threaten the universal service. 

Business Secretary Vince Cable last week warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering' over its same-price delivery obligation

Royal Mail was part privatised last year in a controversial sell-off which critics claimed saw shares bought on the cheap.

Royal Mail has lost 50,000 staff in the last decade, and is shedding 2-3,000 jobs a year.

Letter deliveries are falling by around 4-6 per cent a year and competitors taking business off the Royal Mail in urban areas was making the universal service 'uneconomic'.

As well as competition, postal workers were delivering to more and more addresses, while the number of letters was declining.

As the UK's 'universal service' provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access to competitors such as TNT for final mile deliveries.

Postal regulator Ofcom is investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors.
