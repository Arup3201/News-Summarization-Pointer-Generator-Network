One ambitious young man has snagged himself one of 1,000 Olive Garden pasta passes and is now using the $100 all-you-can eat card in a quest to try every combination of noodles, sauce and meat that the restaurant has to offer.

The 26-year-old Fargo, North Dakota resident who calls himself 'Vino', is chronicling his edible journey on a hilarious blog called All of the Garden.

In just the first week, Vino has already faced heartache, indigestion and the questionable pairing of fried shrimp and alfredo sauce. 

One week down, six more to go.

Challenge accepted! Vino, a 26-year-old in Fargo, North Dakota, is one of 1,000 Olive Garden customers who won a $100 all-you-can-eat pasta card. The card entitles to all the pasta his heart desires for the remaining six weeks

All of the pasta: Vino is blogging is journey trying out the more than 150 different combinations of Olive Garden pasta, sauce and meat on a website called 'All of the Garden'

Vino explained to MailOnline that he won one of the coveted pasta passes by enlisting the help of his friends, who all tried to buy the pass when it recently went on sale. One of the four friends lucked out and now Vino is on a strict all-carb diet. 

'I'm not looking to become famous or anything. I'm just a dude who loves to eat and to write,' he told MailOnline. 

Now for the 49 days his card is valid, Vino, who works in a laboratory, plans to try the more than 150 combinations of pasta, sauce and toppings the restaurant offers. 

'On this site, I will document my journey - the friendships I create and destroy, the changes my body goes through as it adjusts to a purely carbohydrate-based diet,' Vino writes on the blog. 

'Spaghetti & An Entire Sausage' has probably been Vino's least creative name for a pasta dish so far. It consists of spaghetti with marinara  'superbly covered in Italian Sausage'  (Calorie count: 765)

Appetizing? Vino ate this combination of angel hair pasta, alfredo sauce and two meatballs he calls 'Stouffer's' on day two of the project (Calorie count: 1,300)

So much cheese: This colorful monstrosity is nicknamed 'Cheesetube Extreme' by Vino, and consists of penne topped with a rich five cheese marinara sauce (Calorie count: 760)

'On the lighter side': Vino's 'Asian Buffet' of fettuccine, marinara and two meatballs has been one of his 'healthiest' meals yet (Calorie count: 740)

While his body didn't initially take well to the severe increase in sodium, Vino says the challenge is now going 'surprisingly well' as he balances out the empty calories of his pasta meals with servings of salad.

'Things looked grim at first - I had pretty severe side effects from all the food and sodium. But as I found my balance of portion control and eating salad alongside the pasta, those effects subsided and now I feel healthy and alert!' he said.

Those problems surfaced as early as day three, when Vino wrote that 'there are certain things man was not meant to eat.' 

'Today, my body made it quite clear to me that "Nothing but pasta, forever," is near the top of that list. I will spare you the details, but suffice to say it will take some time for equilibrium to be re-established and for me to restore order among the bacterial fauna of my gut,' he wrote. 

While Vino eats a bowl of pasta for lunch, and orders three for dinner, he insists that he doesn't actually lick the plates clean. 

Rather, he eats a small portion for lunch, two full bowls for dinner and just a small helping of the fourth and final bowl. The rest he kindly takes home to share with his sister. 

'So far I haven't gotten bored. There's a surprising amount of subtle differences amongst the menu items once you start looking for them,' Vino said. 

At the end of each day, Vino posts pictures of the day's meals along with reviews of the different combinations, which he gives clever names like 'Asian Buffet', 'Regret', and 'Cheesetube Extreme' which described a plate of penne drenched in cheese marinara sauce. 

The pasta pass project has already been rife with drama, after just one week. 

On day six, Vino had to explain to the new manager of his Olive Garden, that the pasta pass entitles card holders to unlimited to go orders. That matter was eventually cleared up. 

And on day five, Vino brought a  date to dinner and she seemed less than impressed by his pasta pass status. 

But at the end of day seven, Vino is filled with enthusiasm for the weeks ahead.  

'Life seems full of color, the future seems full of possibility, and I seem full of pasta,' Vino writes.
