Just days after Christmas, supermarkets are already beginning their sales on Easter goodies.

Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer are battling with special offers on hot cross buns and Easter eggs - but with more than 80 days until Good Friday, shoppers criticised their thirst for commercial success.

Marks & Spencer in Eltham, south London, was selling Luxury Hot Cross Buns in packs of four at £1.45 - and they were on special offer at two packs for £2. Regular packs of six were going for £1.25.

To compete with this, Sainsbury’s 
four-pack of Taste the Difference Hot Cross Buns were on sale for £1.25 
and their Hot Cross Buns prepared in-store were 50p for a pack of four.

Meanwhile, the Sainsbury’s store in Eltham already had Lindor Mini Eggs on sale alongside Cadbury Caramel Bunnies and MaltEasters Mini Bunnies.

Marks & Spencer was also selling packs of Hide and Seek Chocolate Eggs, Chocolate Origami Hens and packets of Chicky Choccy Speckled Mini Eggs - in a whole aisle dedicated to Easter.

Many Twitter users were shocked to see the Easter chocolate on sale so early in supermarkets.

Richard Martin, of Southampton, Hampshire, said: ‘Why are Sainsbury’s putting out Easter stuff already... just why?’

And Andy Oakley, of Bath, Somerset, added: ‘Spotted Creme Eggs in Sainsbury’s. There really are only three seasons now... Christmas, Easter and Summer.’

A Sainsbury’s spokesman said hot cross buns were on sale all year and there is early demand for Easter goods. Marks & Spencer said customers like to buy Easter eggs early to help spread the cost.
