Sean Abbott is poised to make a brave and emotional return to cricket when he plays for New South Wales against Queensland on Tuesday at the same Sydney Cricket Ground where he bowled the bouncer that fatally injured Phillip Hughes.

Abbott has be named in an enlarged New South Wales squad on Monday after telling team-mates that he wants to return to action but no final decision on his comeback will be made until the morning of the Sheffield Shield match.

The 22-year-old all-rounder has been strengthened by the support of the cricket world since his pivotal role in the tragic accident, not least that of the Hughes family who have comforted Abbott and offered him their full support.

Now it seems that Abbott, who many feared would not be able to play again, will return at the first possible first-class opportunity while the Australian team prepare to also return to action in the rearranged first Test against India.

Abbott has impressed his team-mates with his courage since the incident two weeks ago with New South Wales all-rounder Moises Henriques saying: ‘He is coping pretty well and I guess from our point of view we are trying to expel his name from the tragedy a little bit.

‘I don’t think he was any more at fault than any fast bowler who has ever bowled a bouncer in his career.and we have been treating him just the same as any other player. 

'That’s how Sean wants to be treated.’

Meanwhile every Australian player in Tuesday's first Test at Adelaide will wear a shirt emblazoned with Hughes Test number of 408 and there will be 63 seconds of applause to commemorate the batsman’s score when he was struck.
