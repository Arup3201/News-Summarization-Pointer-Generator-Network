Luis Suarez is not worried after his goalless start to life at Barcelona and insists that his partnership with Lionel Messi and Neymar will work.

The striker has played in two La Liga games since his move from Liverpool this summer but Barcelona have lost both, away against arch-rivals Real Madrid and at home against Celta Vigo.

Suarez, speaking on the eve of his return to face his former side Ajax in the Champions League, says he had always dreamed of playing at Barcelona and will fit in at the club.

He hailed Messi the best player in the world, over Cristiano Ronaldo, and insists that he knows what he has to do to improve and find his feet with Luis Enrique's side.

'It's not just Leo, it's all the other players in the team too. For anyone that has any doubt, I'm completely proud and completely relaxed to have him as a team-mate,' said the Uruguayan.

'All the players learn from each other. Leo learns from us and we learn from him, that way we get on really well. I don't doubt Messi is the best in the world, he can't be compared with anybody.

'I know my colleagues on the pitch now. I felt a little strange at first, but that feeling has passed. Now I feel good, and I thank them because they make me feel part of a whole, it helps me to be more comfortable in the field.'

Suarez admitted that he wasn't yet at his best but is aware of what changes he needs to make to get back to the form that saw him share the European Golden Shoe with Ronaldo last season.

'You always have to win when you play for FC Barcelona. The two losses were certainly tough and now we have to show that we are able to rectify the situation.

'I know what I have to do to improve. Losing these games consecutively is not normal at a club like Barca but I'm happy to be able to come back and play.'

He had plenty of kind words for Ajax and also Liverpool, whom he wished well in their clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday night.

Suarez said: 'All the love that I received at Liverpool was spectacular. Liverpool made me grow and become the Luis Suarez that I am today. Obviously I want them to do well tonight.'

Suarez signed for Ajax after a bitter split with another Dutch side, Gronigen, in 2007.

He took them to court because they rejected an offer from his suitors, and although he lost the case Ajax upped their bid and Gronigen finally accepted it.

The striker became a legend at Ajax, netting an incredible 111 goals in 159 games, eventually earning the captaincy.

He said that he wouldn't celebrate if he scored his first Barcelona goal at the Amsterdam ArenA.

'Obviously I would love to scream and shout with excitement, but out of respect for Ajax I would not,' explained Suarez.

'Playing for Ajax was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. They taught me how to do a lot of things that I couldn't before. I also played in my first Champions League game with them, a dream I have had since I was a boy in South America.

'I really love not just the club, but also the city, because of the way they treated me over the years.

'The people were great to me and I would love to come back and play here. There will surely be an opportunity to come back and play in the future.'  

The former Liverpool striker hopes the Reds do well against Real Madrid in their Champions League clash

Suarez is likely to be given a warm reception from Ajax fans after scoring 111 goals for the Eredivisie side

In November 2010 Suarez bit PSV's Otman Bakkal during a bad tempered goalless draw, eventually being suspended for seven games.

He only turned out twice more for Ajax after that, in the Champions League, before sealing his transfer to Liverpool, and the rest is history.

Despite the incident and his departure, Suarez is still loved by Ajax fans who sang 'You'll never walk alone' to him during a farewell lap of the pitch.

He will be in for a warm reception on Wednesday night as Amsterdam welcomes back home one of its favourite sons.
