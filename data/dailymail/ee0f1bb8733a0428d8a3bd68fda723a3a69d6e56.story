As well as moving Aston Villa up one place in the Premier League table on Tuesday night, Christian Benteke's hat-trick against QPR was also a triumph for the top-flight's Belgian contingent.

The 24-year-old's treble accounted for the 46th, 47th and 48th goals scored by players from Belgium this season, making them the third most prolific nation in the division.

Benteke's goals - which arrived in a memorable 3-3 draw at Villa Park - moved Belgium above France (46 goals) and within 19 of second-placed Spain (67 goals).

Spain have the likes of Chelsea's Diego Costa (19 goals) and Manchester City playmaker David Silva (11 goals) to thank for their tally, although they still sit miles behind runaway leaders England.
