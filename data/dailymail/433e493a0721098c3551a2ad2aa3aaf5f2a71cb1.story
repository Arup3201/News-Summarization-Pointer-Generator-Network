Sold stories: Former Surrey PC Alan Tierney admitted two counts of misconduct in public office

A policeman and a prison officer yesterday pleaded guilty to selling stories about a celebrity and a high-profile inmate to The Sun.

Former Surrey PC Alan  Tierney admitted two counts of misconduct in public office after telling the paper about the arrest of Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood for beating up his girlfriend, and that of former England captain John Terry’s mother for shoplifting.

Prison officer Richard  Trunkfield, 31, of Moulton,  Northamptonshire, pleaded guilty to the same offence for  selling information to journalists about a prisoner.

A second ex-policeman, who cannot be named for legal  reasons, also pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office.

Another public official, who again cannot be named, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office  during the hearings at the Old Bailey.

Tierney and Trunkfield were arrested as part of Operation Elveden, which was set up to investigate allegations of newspapers paying police officers and public officials for information.

Tierney, 40, of Hayling Island, Hampshire, sold the newspaper details about Sue Terry and Sue Poole, the mother and mother-in-law of Premier League star Terry, being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in Surrey in 2009.

The women both accepted cautions over the incident.

Alan Tierney also sold information about the arrest of John Terry's mother and mother-in-law

He also sold details about the arrest of guitarist Wood, 65, on suspicion of assaulting his  Russian lover Ekaterina Ivanova during a drunken brawl. Wood also accepted a caution.

Tierney, who was paid £1,750 by the newspaper, will be sentenced later this month.

Mr Justice Fulford warned him that ‘all options remain open’.

Court: Rebekah Brooks arrives yesterday arriving in at the Old Bailey yesterday in relation to a separate case

Trunkfield, a former prison operational support officer at HMP Woodhill, in Milton  Keynes, Buckinghamshire, admitted leaking information about a prisoner to The Sun in 2009.

He was paid £3,350 for the revelations, the court heard.

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 44, also appeared at the Old Bailey yesterday in relation to a separate case.

The matter was adjourned until next month.

Past News of the World editor and government spin doctor Andy Coulson appeared in the dock as well, in connection with an alleged conspiracy to bribe public officials for information.

The 45-year-old is accused with former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman of requesting and authorising  payments to public officials in exchange for information.

The information referred to is believed to include a royal phone directory known as the ‘Green Book’.

The pair face two counts of  conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office – one from between August 31, 2002 and January 31, 2003, and the other dating from between January 31 and June 3, 2005.

Their case was adjourned until next month.

In a separate hearing, Sun chief reporter John Kay, 69, from north-west London, entered a not guilty plea to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.
