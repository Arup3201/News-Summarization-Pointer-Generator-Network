From Harajuku girls to Cosplay, Japan's fashionistas are famous for their love of colour, quirky sense of style and penchant for dressing up the frilliest ensembles they can lay their hands on.

Now Tokyo's famously eccentric style scene is the subject of a new book, Tokyo Adorned, which shows off the wonderfully girly Kawaii style in all its colourful glory.

One of the most creative Tokyo style tribes, Kawaii girls dress to show off their individuality with takes on the look ranging from the Lolita (sweet and girly) to Gotchi (Gothic).

Pastel explosion: Tokyo women take sweet and girly dressing to the extreme and it seems they have no fear of over accessorising

Think pink: Kawaii girls love the colour and covert pale skin and clothes with frills, bows and lace

'There’s this aspiration to be cute, and they find that to be incredibly empowering and strong,' explained author and photographer, Thomas Card, in an interview with the Daily Beast.

'For these girls, it’s this process of dressing that allows you to see them for who they are. They're constantly changing themselves... If you were to go tomorrow, they would be different again.'

The antithesis of fake-tanned hair-extensioned TOWIE chic, Kawaii girls like pink, kitsch, tutus, delicate dabs of glitter, enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin.

The most common Kawaii style is named the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible.

Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats.

Dare to scare: Gothic is another of the favoured looks, known as Gotchi

Too cute: The women think such an appearance is empowering and looking girly and pretty is known as the 'classic Lolita', right

Style fusion: Some women combine the pastels with the gothic while others create looks of their own like this military inspired outfit with hints of Minnie Mouse, right

Victorian homage: The girls are fond of lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats

Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels.

Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up.

Unsurprisingly, the look has also proved a hit with British teens, some of whom take part in the annual Kawaii fashion show at Hyper Japan, an annual celebration of all things Japanese held at London's Earl's Court each July.

Constantly changing: One day the women could go for a vintage ladylike style, while the next, a gas mask is on trend

One girl who took part in last year's
 show is Grace St. John, a fan of the 'Sweet Lolita' style of Kawaii 
dressing, which includes piling on the lace, bows and frills in order to
 appear as sweet and girly as possible.

But while she loves wearing the look, she does admit it can cause the odd raised eyebrow while out and about in London.

'Sometimes
 being a Kawaii girl can be hard as a lot of people don't understand the
 fashion, and will shout at you in the street,' she reveals.

'But
 I do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they 
like my style too. I went from loving Kawaii things to being a bit of a 
kawaii-aholic!'

 Adorned, the first book from acclaimed New York-based photographer and
