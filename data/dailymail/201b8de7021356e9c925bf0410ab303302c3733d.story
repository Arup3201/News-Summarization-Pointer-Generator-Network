He may be out until the end of September through injury, but Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo still had reason to be cheerful as he celebrated his birthday on Wednesday.

The Spaniard was pictured alongside some of his Manchester City team-mates, as well as friends and family as they gathered for his 29th birthday.

Among those in attendane were Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri, Fernandinho, Pablo Zabaleta and Jesus Nevas.

Negredo is not expected to return to action until the end of September after breaking a metatarsal, as he looks to replicate the same kind of form he showed for the Champions last term - notching 23 goals in all competitions.

However, he may yet be on the move despite this injury setback, with Valencia very keen on striking a deal with City, although they would have to cough up a reported £25million to land the experienced forward.

Manuel Pellegrini's side started the season in positive vein with a 2-0 win at Newcastle, with Liverpool their next opponents in a repeat of last season's top two at the Etihad on Monday night.
