From mysterious disappearances to rape allegations and even murder, cruise ships are no stranger to crime.

But until recently, operators have been reluctant to reveal details of incidents for fear that the revelations will damage their standing among travellers.

Now three of the largest US-based cruise lines have come clean on crime at sea and released data that reveal the extent and nature of onboard incidents in full.

While crime levels at sea remain low, the data released by Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line show that more onboard incidents have happened than previously believed.

Although the US Coastguard, to whom serious crimes at sea are reported, has logged just 31 allegations since January 2011, figures released by Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line reveal a total of 114 alleged incidents since October 2010.

Most of the complaints focused on allegations of rape and sexual assault, followed by thefts.

"We are doing this voluntarily to remove all doubt about the relatively low level of crime on cruise ships, especially when compared with comparable land-based crimes," Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell told CBS News.

"The majority of these are never substantiated as actual crimes after the initial investigation."

Crimes at sea are unusual, although there have been a spate of disappearances in recent years. Among them was John Halford, 63, who vanished during a Red Sea cruise in 2011 and Rebecca Coriam, 24, who went missing during a cruise from Mexico to Los Angeles the same year.

Full disclosure: Carnival will reveal details of incidents in the hope that it will erase doubts about crime at sea

Although figures offered by Dr. Ross Klein of CruiseJunkie.com reveal that 200 people have vanished at sea since 2000, they represent a tiny fraction of the 1.7 million cruise passengers who embark each year.

Nevertheless, bodies such as the International Cruise Victims group have long campaigned for greater transparency from the cruise industry over incidents at sea.

Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims group, said: "I think it's a step in the right direction.

"The question is, is it accurate or is it a public relations move? This is something they have resisted forever.

"If they really are serious, then they will support the new law [the USA recently implemented the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act] so that everybody does it on a consistent basis."
