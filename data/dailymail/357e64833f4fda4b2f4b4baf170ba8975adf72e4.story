England's World Cup team have arrived in South America under the watchful eye of a heavily armed guard stationed outside their hotel.

The team touched down in Rio de Janeiro, and were met by a 40 strong line of Brazilian Army Police guarding 
their beachfront hotel.

The line of troops – some carrying
 riot shields, semi-automatic weapons and pistols – stood at the front 
of the Royal Tulip hotel in the Sao Conrado district of the city.

The team has arrived in Rio amid a storm over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.

It comes after members of the Argentinian team unfurled a politically charged banner before their warm up friendly against Slovenia which claimed sovereignty of the islands they call Las Malvina.

Before the 
game began members of the squad unfurled a banner which read: ‘ Las 
Malvinas Son Argentinas (The Malvinas are Argentine).’

Players were reportedly accosted by a female journalist while on their way into their hotel on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro.

The woman, believed to be Argentinian,  could be heard shouting at midfielder and vice-captain Frank Lampard as he emerged from the team bus: 'What do you think about the Falklands – or Las Malvinas?’

Lampard ignored the question as he and other members of the 23-strong squad entered their five star hotel.

The
 simmering row over the Falklands is still evident decades after the 
islands were invaded by Argentinian forces in 1982 before being 
reclaimed by British forces during a brief but intense conflict.

Islanders voted by 1,513 to three in 
favour of remaining British in a referendum last year, which Prime 
Minister David Cameron claimed ‘could not have sent a clearer message.’

The ‘ring of steel’ provided by the authorities was ordered after a bus carrying Brazil’s national team was attacked two weeks ago in the city by a 200 strong mob of angry teachers protesting at the rising costs of hosting the 2014 World Cup.

During England’s stay at the 418 room and 17 floor hotel the ‘Three Lions’ contingent will occupy two floors of the building with security provided by both the FA and the Brazilian authorities.

Outside the building a total of 24 Army Police will be posted on 24-hour duty while nine officers will accompany the team when they travel to their training ground which is a thirty minute drive from their hotel base.
