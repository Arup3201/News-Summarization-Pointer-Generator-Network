Labour health supremo Andy Burnham has clashed with Ed Miliband over a plan for ‘drunk tanks’ in Accident and Emergency units which would give priority to sober people with injuries.

Burnham wants to pledge that a crackdown on drunks in A&E departments will be introduced if Labour wins next year’s Election.

But the Labour leader has refused to let him announce the move for fear it could backfire.

Last year, more than a million people were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries – double the number in 2002/3

The friction between them comes amid growing reports that Burnham is favourite to succeed the embattled Opposition leader. Allies of Miliband have accused Burnham, 44, of running a covert campaign to promote his leadership credentials, including meetings with key Labour activists and union leaders who will have a big say in who succeeds Miliband.

Health chiefs say waiting times for treatment in A&E units have been exacerbated by the growing number of drunk people who turn up demanding help. At present, hospitals treat all A&E patients equally, regardless of whether they are drunk or sober.

It means elderly patients, children and others who need urgent care are forced to wait while a person whose injury is caused by their own drunkenness is treated first.

If ‘drunk tanks’ are introduced, drunk people would join a separate queue, though there would be safeguards to protect those with life-threatening injuries.

Labour supporters of the idea see it as a good way to counter Tory claims that if Miliband becomes Prime Minister, he would ‘throw money’ at the NHS – with much of it wasted.

The call comes amid mounting concern over the rising cost of treating people under the influence.

Last year, more than a million people were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries – double the number in 2002/3.

Earlier this summer, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, called for drunk tanks in hospitals where there are enough staff to make sure that those with head injuries were not left untreated.

He said: ‘They say there was a time when this was a Friday or Saturday phenomenon but is now round-the-week. There’s hardly a time when there isn’t someone with an alcohol problem in an A&E department.’

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb has called for drunk people to be forced to pay a fee for A&E treatment.

Studies show one in three who go to A&E because of alcohol are admitted, costing about £3 billion a year.
