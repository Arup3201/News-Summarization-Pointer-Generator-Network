Barcelona have announced that Ibrahim Afellay will join Greek champions Olympiacos on a season-long loan. 

The midfielder's deal is initially just for a year, but the club have the option of extending it by a further two. 

The Dutchman joined Barcelona from PSV in 2010, but a series of leg injuries have limited him to 35 appearances for the Catalan club.

Olympiacos, managed by former Real Madrid midfielder Michel, loaned Joel Campbell from Arsenal last season.  

Transfer: Ibrahim Afellay has moved to Greek champions Olympiacos on a season-long loan

Option: Michel's side may extend the Dutch midfielder's deal by a further two years should they wish to

But, after the Costa Rican's performances at the World Cup, Arsene Wenger decided to give him a chance at his parent club, forcing the Greek side to look for reinforcements.

Afellay will now become Campbell's replacement. The midfielder will join up with another former Barcelona player - Javier Saviola, who joined the club last summer from Malaga 

The 28-year-old Afellay played just two games for Barcelona last season, but even before such a disappointing campaign it had become clear his future lay elsewhere.

Afellay has 44 caps for the Netherlands, and has scored five international goals. His Barcelona contract expires next June.

Disappointment: Afellay signed for Barcelona in 2010, but he only made 35 appearances for the club

Problems: A series of injuries hampered the midfielder's Barcelona career, and he will not play for them again
