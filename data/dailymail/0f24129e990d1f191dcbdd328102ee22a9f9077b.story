Overdose: Ana Hernandez, pictured, was found dead with a huge amount of painkillers in her system

The death of a Spanish lawyer who died from a huge overdose of painkillers has been left a mystery after an inquest failed to reach a conclusion.

Ana Hernandez, 32, was found dead on 28 June 2012 with a cocktail of drugs in her system, which exceeded recommended levels more than 100 times.

She had moved to Barbburgh in Yorkshire to live with her fiancé, lecturer Darren Stott, and was found by friends in the house they shared.

The inquest, held in Doncaster, heard that Mr Stott was a controlling partner, but that he was away at the time she died.

As well as the drugs in her system, it was found that Miss Hernandez had also eaten a heavily-spiced stew shortly before she died.

There was a suggestion that the tablets could have been ground up and added to her meal, but the coroner decided there was not enough evidence to justify a verdict of unlawful killing.

Miss Hernandez had met Mr Stott, a 42-year-old who taught English at Leeds Metropolitan University, while he was on holiday in Gran Canaria in Marh 2011.

The two fell in love and moved back to Mr Stott's home in England just under a year later. They got engaged and Miss Hernandez became pregnant around the time of the move.

The inquest heard from friends of Miss Hernandez that she was a healthy and upbeat person who usually avoided taking any sort of medicine.

It was also said that Mr Stott was a 'control freak' who followed Miss Hernandez's every move, and also that she allegedly confided to friends that she thought he might be trying to kill her with drugs.

Ana’s semi-naked body was found on a bed in the three-bedroom bungalow next to a packed suitcase by family friends Carolyn and Geoffrey Telford.

Prescription drugs, which Mr Stott had taken for his whole adult life, were found all over the house. The inquest heard that Mr Stott was in London on a course at the time the body was found.

Toxicologist Dr Stephen Morley said 
he could not say definitively that the tablets were taken at the same 
time as the stew Miss Hernandez had eaten, but that it was possible they had been ground up.

He said the concentrations of codeine,
tramadol and cyclizine alone could have killed her but in combination 
they were 'very likely' to have caused her death.

The inquest opened in December 2012, but was adjourned so that police could make further enquiries.

In the wake of Ana's death, Mr Stott moved back to Gran Canaria, but fell ill there and collapsed in the street.

He has since returned and is in a 
hospital neurology unit in a 'very poorly state' with 'physical and 
neurological difficulties' and was unable to evidence at today's 
inquest.

Speaking at an earlier hearing in December, Mrs Telford, 47, told the inquest: 'Ana told me Darren kept telling her to take the tablets and she said “he’s trying to kill me.”

At the resumed hearing today, she added: 'She was looking forward to her 
pregnancy and she refused even to take paracetamol for a headache. Her 
attitude was not to take tablets when you are pregnant.

'She was close to her mum. I can’t think she would take her own life and do that to her mum.'

She also said that Miss Hernandez had been complaining about her fiancé's drinking.

Mr Telford, 56, said: 'Ana was 
taking paracetamol and she felt Darren was trying to kill her. She told 
me "Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs."

He said Mr Stott followed her everywhere - even to the toilet - and compared the treatment to domestic abuse.

Mrs Telford said at the resumed 
hearing that Ana had complained to her about Mr Stott’s drinking and 
that he used her as a taxi service.

Miss Hernandez's brother Rafael, 42, told the
inquest: 'She was always positive and buzzing. In the week before she 
died she was going on and on to mother that she had a big headache.

'I 
was told it was due to her pregnancy and would pass.

'She was as fit as a fiddle and never 
smoked or drank and was scared of medication. She didn’t like it at all.
You had to tie her down to give her anything.'

He claimed Mr Stott was a 'control 
freak' and wanted to know Ana’s every movement - but that she seemed 
happy and had no problems.

Mr Stott said in a statement she was not enjoying her pregnancy and could not go to the gym which she enjoyed.

She was reluctant to take any medication during her pregnancy 'She was fearful of harming the baby,' he said.

New life: Ms Hernandez moved to the village of Barnburgh (pictured), South Yorkshire, to live with Mr Stott whom she met in Gran Canaria.

Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said Miss 
Hernandez had died within two to four hours of taking the tablets which 
he thought may have been ground up.

Det Sgt David Robertson, who led the police inquiry told the inquest: 'I’m unable to say beyond any reasonable doubt that he had anything to do with her death. He was in London at the time.'

Coroner Nicola Mundy recorded an open verdict saying she had considered unlawful killing but there was not enough proof.

Det Sgt Roberstson said: 'The question remains, how did high levels of medication get into Ana’s body?'

He told the hearing that two previous partners of Mr Stott both described him as 'unusual', controlling and dishonest at times.

He once sprayed a substance in the mouth of his then partner which left her sick on a plane after she complained of a migraine and he injected another partner in the leg with a pain killer when she too said she had a headache.

Det Sgt Robertson said he would have liked to have talked to Mr Stott to have 'clarified certain points' but added: 'There was no evidence to suggest he would want to wish any harm to Ana.'

Ms Mundy said she had discounted Ana accidentally taking too many tablets and she did not believe it was a deliberate act.

Of unlawful killing she said: 'It has not been possible for the reasons told to me by Det Sgt Robertson for him to complete the investigations.

'It is unlikely that he is going to be able to interview potential key witnesses to shed more light on what might have happened.

'Becauase it is such a high burden of proof I need to have more evidence.'

After the hearing Rafael Hernandez said: 'I don’t understand really. I don’t know whether Mr Stott is responsible.'
