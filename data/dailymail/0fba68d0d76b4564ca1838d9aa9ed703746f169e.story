Red Bull customers who expected to get a $10 refund from Red Bull because they didn't automatically grow wings will be getting something more like $3 or less after the company's site crashed from having too many visitors.

Energy drink Red Bull GmbH settled two class-action lawsuits this week, agreeing to pay $13million because their famous slogan 'Red Bull gives you wings' isn't true.

It was originally reported that anyone who bought a drink from January 1, 2002 to October 3, 2014 would be eligible to receive either a $10 cash payment of $15 in Red Bull product -regardless of whether there was a receipt for proof as long as they applied online before March 2 2015.

Pay up: Red Bull settled two class-action lawsuit this week, agreeing to pay $13million for false advertising

The Drum reports that the site was was visited 4.6 million times in the last 24 hours and that many of the claims are most likely fraudulent. 

Due to the mass amount of claims the settlement is likely to offer applicants just $3.

Even though the amount is small, claimants are likely to get the money in as soon as 150 days. 

According to the terms of the lawsuit, the company agreed to pay customers up to $13million, not $10 in cash to anyone who filed a claim by the deadline 

Flase claims: Above, grabs from a 2000 advertisement for Red Bull in which it claims to give drinkers 'wiiings' 

The offer only applies to customers in the U.S. 

In one of the lawsuits, a consumer who had been drinking the product for years wrote that they had experienced no increase in performance, concentration of reaction speed.

'Such deceptive conduct and practices mean that [Red Bull's] advertising and marketing is not just "puffery," but is instead deceptive and fraudulent and is therefore actionable,' the suit says. 

'Even though there is a lack of genuine scientific support for a claim that Red Bull branded energy drinks provide any more benefit to a consumer than a cup of coffee, the Red Bull defendants persistently and pervasively market their product as a superior source of "energy" worthy of a premium price over a cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine,' the suit says

Red Bull has agreed to change their marketing campaign, but insists their advertising was never misleading to begin with. 

'Red Bull settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. However, Red Bull maintains that its marketing and labeling have always been truthful and accurate, and denies any and all wrongdoing or liability,' the company said in a statement.  

The settlement could be approved by May with payments being sent out withing 150 days of the final approval.
