Police have said the kidnapping of a couple from a New York street in broad daylight last week could have been a hoax between friends.

The alleged abduction of a man and a woman at gunpoint occurred at 6.55 pm on Friday near 173rd Street and Haven Avenue, 
in Washington Heights, New York.

After the kidnapping, the NYPD released video surveillance 
footage of the incident in the hope that a member of the public would be able to identify the masked abductors and help the investigation.

But on Sunday night, the department's Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne voiced doubts over the veracity of the incident.

A hoax? Men were seen sprinting away from the scene after allegedly kidnapping a couple at gunpoint on Friday afternoon. Police have now suggested it could have been a joke

He said it 'may have been a hoax staged amongst friends to celebrate one of their birthdays'.

While he would not provide further details, he did say that no one filed a missing persons report since the alleged kidnapping, CNN reported.

New York police had originally said 
they were hunting for at least three suspects who were thought to have 
snatched a couple off a street at gunpoint and hustled them into a black
minivan.

The video appears to show two men, dressed in black, fleeing the scene, quickly followed by a speeding van with tinted windows.

Police said: 'Several persons 
notified members of the 33rd precinct Detective Squad after hearing a 
woman scream and observing two unidentified males force the victims into
a vehicle at gunpoint.'

According to the New York Post, two of the eyewitnesses were ten-year-old girls who then called 911.

The Post described the female victim as white or a light-skinned Hispanic woman who was carrying two backpacks or a large duffel bag.

Authorities said the male victim was wearing all-dark clothing.

An NYPD helicopter was dispatched to help officers with the search.

Police have not said whether the people involved will face charges if the incident was indeed a hoax. The investigation is ongoing.
