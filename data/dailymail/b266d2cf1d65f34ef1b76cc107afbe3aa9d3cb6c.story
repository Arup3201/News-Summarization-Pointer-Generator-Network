The Commons could sit in the Olympic Park or Birmingham while MPs are made homeless to allow major building work to be carried out on the Houses of Parliament.

At least £1bn of maintenance is needed to remove asbestos, repair brickwork and upgrade water and electricity supplies.

Commons officials claim trying to do the work in parts while MPs and peers are on holiday could take years, and cost billions more.

Hitting the road: MPs will have to leave the House of Parliament for £1 billion of work to be carried out

Today MPs lined up to back the idea of hitting the road, and suggested alternative sites.

John Thurso, speaking for the House of Commons Commission, said ‘all options can be placed on the table’.

He added: ‘From my experience I have found it is usually better to leave for two years, or whatever, and get the job done, than be inconvenienced and unable to work properly for 10 years.’

It had been thought that if MPs did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby, possibly in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower or across the road the QE2 conference centre.

But Mr Thurso said he was willing to consider ideas from MPs that they look further afield.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who left government in last week’s reshuffle, said made a ‘shameless bid that if Parliament is going to decant, it decants to Birmingham’.

The MP for nearby Lichfield added: ‘Why not, it's our second city?’But Labour Meg Hillier made a rival bid for her part of London, claiming the Olympic media centre in Hackneym, where she is MP, could be a ‘fantastic facility’

‘While awaiting a tenant (it) could happily house Parliament in the interim while the work is done, with a seven-minute shuttle to St Pancras, City Airport on the doorstep, excellent transport links, 20 minutes to Westminster.

‘Would the House of Commons Commission consider a temporary relocation of Parliament to 'eastminster'?’

A report into what work needs to be done – and how long it will take – is being finalised.

Parliamentary officials are struggling to find a cost effective way of carrying out the repairs while Parliament continues to function on site.

In the Commons today no MP spoke against the idea of a shipping out of Westminster.

Asked about the final bill for the building work, Mr Thurso admitted it is ‘difficult at this stage to make a proper assessment of cost’.

Major work has not been carried out on the building's interior since it was bombed in 1941.

He added: ‘What the commission will do is ensure it pursues the best value for money, being the combination of the lowest cost option with keeping Parliament functioning properly.’

The Houses of Parliament in Westminster cost about £30m a year to run.

Each month the European Parliament relocates from its Brussels base to sit in Strasbourg. But many British politicians have criticised the £200m annual cost of the rotation.
