Valentine's Day - the most romantic day of the year - falls on Thursday and many will seize the opportunity to go down on one knee.

But for one UK woman romance is more than a day - it's a year round job. Jewellery designer and business owner Harriet Kelsall finds herself at the heart of hundreds of romantic and unusual proposals every year. Loved up couples flock to her studios in Hertfordshire and Cambridge to share their love stories and get advice on how to create the engagement ring of their dreams.

So Harriet, 41, who launched Harriet Kelsall Bespoke Jewellery 13 years ago, seemed the perfect person to tell MailOnline about some of the unique proposals she has encountered over the years.

Each of the couples has visited her for an entirely bespoke ring that tells the story of their love...

Underwater love: Daniel proposed to Zoe by writing a message on a sea bed in Thailand

Daniel
Kurk, 30, proposed to Zoe Church, 35, on the bottom of the ocean. The 
couple, from Watford in Hertfordshire, are planning a beach wedding this
year…

Daniel said: I 
planned to pop the question in Thailand on our second joint holiday 
there. I'd spent over a month on the island of Koh Tao when I'd been 
travelling a few years back. It is where I qualified for my open water 
and advanced diving licenses and I had become firm friends with one of 
the dive shop owners.

When I
returned to Koh Tao with Zoe I arranged for my friend to supply us with
snorkel gear and a dive bag and I told him my plans.

I
booked a night's stay on the tiny island of Koh Nang Yuan about a mile 
off shore and the following morning I got up at sunrise and snuck off 
into the bay while Zoe slept.

In joke: Kurt's 'wife me, LOL' message referred to an episode of Come Dine With Me the pair had enjoyed

Thumbs up: A snorkeling Zoe signals her assent

I
collected a dive bag full of dead coral that had washed up at the foot 
of the beach and then swam out into the bay to write a message on the 
sea bed. I managed to get back to our villa just as Zoe was waking up.

Ring to reflect the proposal: It's shaped like a wave and the topaz gem is the colour of the sea

I
tempted Zoe into the water by pretending to have seen a turtle. We swam
into the bay and I kept making her swim further and further out. When 
she finally saw the message she did a double take and started laughing 
bubbles. She thought someone else had left the message.

Then
she looked at me, looked back at the message, more bubbles and then 
nearly drowned as she forgot to breath! We made it back to shore after a
few happy tears on her part.

The
message itself is very silly.  Zoe's favourite TV show is Come Dine 
With Me and during a WAG special, the wives talked about their 
proposals. Emile Hesky's wife said Emile had proposed via a text message
and the narrator, Dave Lamb, screamed, 'What did it say, Wife Me LOL?'.

It turned into one of Zoe’s favourite jokes for about the next six 
months, so I didn’t really have much choice but to write that as my 
proposal.

Our ring needed 
to be just as special as the proposal so Harriet's team designed one around the themes of water and the ocean.

The ring was designed to look like the crest of a wave and the central 
stone is blue topaz, to reflect the colour of the ocean. A perfect 
symbol of our future lives together.

Graham, 45, and Angela Gunn, 43, both have a special place in their hearts for Sylvester - their 1967 VW Beetle. The couple, from northern Scotland, tied the knot three months ago

Graham said: It has always been the three of us and we've had so many adventures together, travelling to car shows across Britain and even entering Sylvester into events.

Drive of their life: The Gunns had to get engaged in the presence of their beloved VW Beetle Sylvester

I proposed to Angela in March 2012 on a beautiful beach in a Scottish village called Melvich. Everything was perfect, the sun was shining and the breeze was warm. Sylvester was all spruced up for the event and I'm even sure I could see him smiling for the photos.

Perfect fit: The ring was designed to look like a VW headlight

I wanted Angela to be involved in her engagement ring so, when she said yes, our creative side went into overdrive. We wanted a ring that had features of Sylvester so we trawled through photos and chose headlights as our inspiration.

This model of Beetle has a distinct, sloping headlight, so we took our photos and ideas to the designer and together created something stunning. Look at the ring and you'll see that the diamond represents a headlight and the setting is its holder. If you look closely you’ll even see how the headlight slopes but the actual light inside is vertical.

Seeing our VW inspired ring come to life was amazing and made our engagement even more special.

We got married last October and Sylvester was, of course, a key part. He took Angela to the church and was even the inspiration behind our wedding cake design.

My mum made Angela’s dress and a friend embroidered Sylvester's registration number and sloping headlights on to her train. It was a day to remember.

Aviation loving Alex Hockley, 27, took to the skies to propose to girlfriend Hayley Faithfull, 27. The couple, from Chandler’s Ford in Hampshire, are due to wed in April

Alex said: When I decided to propose I knew I wanted an utterly unique location and a ring which would have real meaning and which couldn’t be bought over the counter by anyone else.

I wanted to propose in the sky but the first thing I needed to do was create a ring to match the occasion. I was brought up in aviation and flying is practically my life so I wanted to give Hayley a ring that either looked like, or represented, an aircraft.

On the wings of love: Alex Hockley took to the skies to propose to Hayley in an RAF Bulldog aircraft

The largest aircraft I have ever flown is a Bechcraft Kingair so I took this as my inspiration and asked the designer to use a propeller to inspire a twisted shape in the ring.

The cone of the aircraft is where the diamond sits and three stones were added at either side to create a shading effect, something similar to the look you get when a propeller spins around. I chose the blue stones to match the colour of Hayley’s eyes.

Personal: The ring style was inspired by an airplane propeller and includes gems in the colour of Hayley's eyes

For the proposal itself I flew Hayley in an RAF Bulldog aircraft to Garmi, the boundary point between England and France, which is where I popped the question. But I couldn't get down on bended knees since I was flying! Hayley said 'yes' and when we landed I presented her with the ring.

We are getting married in two months and, with an aviation inspired ring firmly on Hayley's finger, I know that flying will be in our lives forever.

Graham
Finney proposed to his wife Caroline, both 30, with a ring inspired by 
their first holiday together. They have now been married for six months 
and live in Belfast

Graham says: Caroline
was learning to scuba dive when I met her. She convinced me to learn 
too and we fell in love in the water and have been diving buddies since.

Diving in: Graham and Caroline share a love of the water sport

Caroline had dreamed of having an octopus ring for years, ever since seeing one at a diver’s show.

Holiday memory: Caroline's ring is made to look as though an octopus is clasping the diamond

Using an octopus as inspiration for 
our engagement ring seemed an obvious choice, especially since it 
reminded me of our first diving holiday together when the octopus we 
spotted under water took one look at us and immediately hid itself in a 
hole.

Our guide managed to tempt it out by using the metal strap on 
Caroline’s watch to catch the sun.

It turns out octopus love anything 
sparkly so it seemed perfect that an octopus should hold the sparkling 
diamond in Caroline’s ring.

I submitted sketches to Harriet and 
the designer made exactly what I wanted. After having it commissioned I 
hid our engagement ring for a whole year and waited until we were on our
cruise on the Nile, where I proposed at sunset on the captain's deck.

Although we got engaged on dry land our diving buddies joined in to celebrate. It was perfect.
