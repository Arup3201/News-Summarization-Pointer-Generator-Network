Hayley Brown, 41, from Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, who was sentenced for her Turkish property scam that targeted British investors

A con woman who stole hundreds of thousands of pounds out of British investors in a Turkish property scam has been jailed.

Hayley Brown, 41, of Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire, conned her victims into shelling out large amounts of money, with one losing around £600,000 as a result of the scam.

One 80-year-old farmer who was seduced by Brown's scheme claimed that he would have to work for the rest of his life as a result.

Brown denied the ten offences of fraud, three of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and two of using a false document with the intent to deceive, between March 2006 and July 2009.

She was jailed for four years after being convicted at Leeds Crown Court.

An investigation found that £1.2 million was allegedly paid to Brown in the belief that property investment would follow.

In a separate case, she was jailed for
 five years after admitting two accounts of firearms offences, including
 the possession of a disguised firearm in the form of a taser made to 
look like a mobile phone, and the possession of a canister of 'CS type 
gas', a prohibited weapon.

Paul
 Reid, prosecuting, said Brown's activities were 'thoroughly dishonest' 
and that she promised potential investors excellent returns on 
properties in the Bodrum area of Turkey.

Hayley Brown would convince people that she was investing money that they gave her in rental properties in Bodrum, Turkey

She would take her 'investors' on all expenses paid tours of their rental properties, but would not allow them inside, claiming that people were living there

The investors were seduced by the incredibly low investment prices, thinking they were getting a great deal on investments

Investors were 'seduced into parting with their money' by low purchase prices.

They paid her and she told them she had bought properties in their name.

They would receive rent income and, after three years, would have the option of renewing the arrangement, selling them, living in the properties or continuing to rent them out.

Brown often paid for them and their families to stay in expensive hotels in Turkey and took them on tours of properties.

They were told they could not go inside the actual properties because they were occupied by people paying rent, people came away feeling reassured.

However, when rental income began irregular and they did not receive the returns they had been promised, investors instructed Brown to sell the properties, they were given excuses about why the proceeds had not materialised.

They were shown false bank statements and forged official documents claiming to show money had been received by her, ready to be passed on.

Mr Reid said: 'Many have received little or none of the original outlay, let alone the promised returns by way of rental income.

'Some are owed tens of thousands or, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of pounds.

'Throughout, this defendant has acted thoroughly dishonestly, to the extent of falsifying a number of documents.

'Hayley Brown has never been given permission to work in Turkey. She has never paid tax in Turkey.

'There are no properties we are aware of registered in her name in Turkey.

'She has produced forged documentation. She has lied consistently and persuasively.

'She has paid money to some people but that's a facade to keep the thing going.

'What she has been doing is financing her personal lifestyle.'

Brown claimed after she was arrested in November 2009 she had millions of pounds invested in Turkish bonds and earned between £300,000 and £400,000 a year.

Brown was sentenced before a jury at Leeds Crown Court, for two separate cases that were heard at different times

She was handed four years for her charges involving the investment scam at Leeds Combined Courts centre, as well as a further five years for breaking weapon laws

She 'dreamed up' millions of pounds supposedly invested in banks, including in Cyprus, but 'none of that money ever materialised'.

Brown also forged e-mails between her and bank officials about transfers of large sums of money.

Mr Reid said: 'There is a web of duplicity and fraud and straightforward dishonesty running through everything this defendant does.'

Sentencing her to nine years in prison, Judge Guy Kearl QC said: 'You deceived investors into thinking they owned properties and they were receiving rent.

'You attacked the counsel throughout the trial and accused them of lying in the witness stand.

You know particularly well who was lying in this case.

Brown was from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, and had, according to the prosecutor, never worked or paid taxes in Turkey

'The effect you have had on others ought not to be under-estimated. The fraud you've committed is breathtaking.'

Dc Graham Duncan, of Humberside Police, said: 'Victims invested large sums of money in the anticipation of purchasing property.

'Several investors were taken on all expense paid trips to Turkey where they would be shown, from a distance, various properties which they believed they had purchased.

'The Humberside Police investigation involved extensive enquiries throughout the United Kingdom and overseas with the assistance of the Turkish authorities.

'Brown clearly used the funds to support her lifestyle with no consideration as to how her selfish actions would impact on other people, who put their trust in her.

'The financial and emotional impact on the victims in this case has been considerable and i hope that this sentence brings some closure to them.'
