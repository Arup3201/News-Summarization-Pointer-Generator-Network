At least 30 people have been killed another 100 missing and feared dead after torrential rains triggered a massive landslide that buried a remote village in western India.

Authorities said the chances of survival were slim for anyone still trapped under the mud in Malin - a village of 700 people in Pune district of Maharashtra state.

Rescue workers were finally able to use earth-moving equipment to dig through heavy mud and debris today - more than 24 hours after the disaster hit the remote village.

Two days of torrential rains triggered the disaster and continued to pound the area as rescuers brought bodies covered in soaked white sheets to waiting ambulances.

Bad communications, dangerous roads and debris delayed national rescue personnel from the stricken area for several hours yesterday.

The disaster only came to light when a bus driver passed by and saw that the village had disappeared under masses of mud and earth.

'The driver returned to a nearby city and alerted authorities,' Jadhav said. "Everything on the mountain came down.'

30 bodies have been recovered and eight people fond alive, rescue official Sachin Tambol said.

 Dhonde, who was working in another town when the landslide ripped 
through his village, said only two people managed to get out alive. 'The other six are buried under the mud,' he added.

Digging: Rescue workers were finally able to use earth-moving equipment to dig through heavy mud and debris today - more than 24 hours after the disaster hit the remote village

Crowds of people from nearby areas were helping rescuers, using their bare hands to move fallen trees and rocks.

About 250 disaster response workers and at least 100 ambulances were involved in the rescue effort, officials said.

Overnight, emergency workers used flood lights mounted on jeeps to illuminate the disaster area, where the tangled roofs of homes poked up through thick mud.

Rescuers expected the death toll to 
rise in the village at the foothills of the Sahyadri Mountains.

Sandeep 
Rai Rathore, a top official of the National Disaster Response Force, 
estimated that around 100 people were missing and feared dead.

Prime
 Minister Narendra Modi mourned the loss of lives and said all possible 
efforts must be made to help the victims, according to a statement from 
his office.

He sent Home Minister Rajnath Singh to the disaster area.

Landslides
 are common in the area during the monsoon season, which runs from June 
to September.

The area around the village has been deforested 
extensively, increasing the risk of landslides. Similar 
environmental damage have caused floods and landslides
 in other parts of India.

Pune district is about 95 miles south-east of Mumbai, India's commercial capital.

This morning, heavy rains hit a remote mountainous village in northern 
India and six members of a family were feared dead, said police officer 
Pravin Tamta.

Police have recovered two bodies and were searching for 
four others in Tehri district in the hilly Uttarakhand state, Tamta 
said. The village is 200 miles north of New Delhi.

Last
 year, more than 6,000 people were killed as floods and landslides swept
 through Uttarakhand state during the monsoon season.
