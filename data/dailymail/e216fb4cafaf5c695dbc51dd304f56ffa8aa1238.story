More than 11,000 amendments have been proposed in U.S. congressional history, but only 17 have been added to the Constitution.

If some of the thousands of amendments had been approved, life as we know it in America would change radically: There would be no president, Americans would declare their allegiance to the United States of Earth, and it would be illegal to get a divorce.

As numbers show, though Congress and the states can change the U.S. Constitution through the amendment process, it's very rare.  

The U.S. Constitution (left) was created in 1787 and went into effect in 1789. The Bill of Rights (right) and its first ten amendments went into effect in 1791. Since then, 17 amendments have been added

One failed proposal, for example, came in 1893 from U.S. Representative Lucas Miller from Wisconsin, who said that America should change its name to 'the United States of Earth', according to Yahoo.

'It is possible for the Republic to grow through the admission of new States into the Union until every Nation on Earth has become part of it,' Miller, who wasn't nominated for a second term, suggested.

1876: A three-person, Roman-style triumvirate should replace role of president

1876: Eliminate the Senate and Presidency 

1876: Forbid religious leaders from occupying a governmental office or receiving federal funding

1893: Rename America the 'United States of the Earth'

1893: Abolish the U.S. Army and Navy

1894: Acknowledge that the Constitution recognizes God and Jesus Christ as supreme leaders in human affairs 

1912: Marriage between races should be illegal

1921: Divorce should be illegal

1916: Put all acts of war to a national vote. Any 'yes' voter has to register as a volunteer for service in the U.S. Army 

1933: Limit income to $1million - all excess goes toward lowering national debt 

1936: Allow American people to vote on whether or not country should go to war 

1938: Forbid drunkenness in all states and U.S. territories

1947: Income tax for individuals should not exceed 25 per cent

1948: Give the right of citizens to segregate themselves from others

1971: American citizens should have the alienable right to an environment free of pollution

An amendment, first proposed in the 1880s, that would regulate marriage and divorce was introduced to Congress every year for about 60 years. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, too, lobbed to give Congress power over divorces without passing an amendment. 

And one 1921 amendment tried to eliminate the idea of divorce entirely. 

'Congress shall have power to establish and enforce by appropriate legislation uniform laws as to marriage and divorce: Provided that every state may by law exclude, as to its citizens duly domiciled therein, any or all causes for absolute divorce in such laws mentioned,' the proposal read. 

In 1876, a citizen named Augustus Wilson proposed to Congress that the role of the president be eliminated and replaced with a three-person, Roman-style triumvirate. 

That same year, residents of Potter County, Pennsylvania, suggested an amendment that would eliminate the Senate and Presidency. 

National Archives records show that they were upset because the Senate 'always advanced the interest of the money, railroad and manufacturing speculators to the prejudice of the common welfare'. 

And in 1933, U.S. Representative Wesley Lloyd, from Washington, proposed that excess income for millionaires making more than $1million per year be put toward lowering the national debt.

A 2005 proposal - the Flag Desecration Amendment - came within one vote of passing Senate in 2006 after the House had approved it.

The Corwin Amendment, which guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep 'persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State', was approved by Congress in 1861, but it was not ratified by the states.

To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be proposed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives or by two-thirds of the state legislatures in what's called a constitutional convention.

For the proposed amendment to then be approved, three-quarters of the state legislatures have to vote to ratify it.

Lucas Miller (left) proposed that America change its name to 'the United States of Earth' in 1893 because he believed the nation could take over every nation on Earth. Though Theodore Roosevelt (right) never proposed an amendment to make divorce illegal like many others did, he lobbied to give Congress power over the subject

For an amendment to become part of the constitution, it must be first proposed by two-thirds the Senate and House or two-thirds of state legislatures. It then is up to the states to approve the proposal. Three-quarters of the states must vote to ratify it for the amendment to become valid

U.S. House of Representatives member Thomas Corwin proposed an amendment that guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep 'persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State'. It was passed by Congress in 1861 but failed to ratify

A few proposed amendments came close to ratification, including the Titles of Nobility Amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment. 

But since the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments passed in 1791, 99 per cent of the amendments haven't made it through the congressional approval or constitutional convention,

Of the 17 that have made it through the process, one has already been repealed – the 18th Amendment, which established Prohibition.

The 27th Amendment established in 1992, the last to be passed, barred Congress from giving itself a pay raise during the current season.

In today's 113th Congress, many proposed amendments focus on balancing the governmental budget and allowing campaign financing. 

Others include outlawing same-sex marriages nationally, imposing limits on Senate and House terms, repealing the 22nd amendment that limits the presidency term and eliminating the 16th amendment and income taxes.
