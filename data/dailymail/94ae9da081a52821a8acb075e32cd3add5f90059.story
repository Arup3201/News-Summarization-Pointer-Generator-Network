President Barack Obama is slapping back at a former longtime top adviser who writes in a new book that he lied for years about his position on gay marriage so he could get elected president in 2008.

David Axelrod 'is mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue,' the president said Tuesday, in a startling admission that his public stance on the divisive social issue wasn't always in sync with what he actually believed.

'I always felt that same-sex couples should be able to enjoy the same rights, legally, as anybody else,' Obama told Buzzfeed, and so it was frustrating to me not to, I think, be able to square that with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there.'

Documents reveal wild swings in the Chicago politician's stated positions as his career developed in the 1990s and beyond. But on Tuesday the president claimed his true feelings never wavered.

HE LIED: Obama misled the public about his views on gay marriage in order to get to the White House, according to his longtime close adviser David Axelrod (center, pictured in the Oval Office in 2010)

By the year 2000, as an Illinois state senator, Obama already been through a flip-flop on same-sex marriage, one that wouldn't come full circle for more than another decade 

The president responded to a questionnaire in 1996 from the Chicago-based Outlines newspaper, as he was making his first run for the state Senate in Illinois, saying that he strongly believed in legalizing same-sex unions.

'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages,' Obama wrote then.

Two years later, as his political future began to take shape, he told the same newspaper that he was 'undecided.'

Obama said Tuesday that 'the old questionnaire, you know, is an example of struggling with what was a real issue at the time, which is how do you make sure that people’s rights are enjoyed and these religious sensitivities were taken into account?'

'You know, these are the kinds of things you learn as you ... move forward in public life: that sometimes you can’t split the difference. That sometimes you just have to be very clear that this is what’s right.'

It took the president more than a decade to take that advice.

By 2008, under the glare of a presidential campaign and the weight of history, his public rhetoric swung to a position that America's Bible belt could embrace – support for only a traditional definition of marriage.

But as president in 2010 he returned publicly to his original position 14 years after he first articulated it. 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday about the timeline that brought Obama to his eventual public awakening on the issue, which came after a series of court rulings made it less politically risky to support gay marriage rights.   

Axelrod writes in 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics' that he told the future president in 2008 that he should hide the ball and deceive the American public for political purposes.

'Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church,' the former Obama insider writes, 'and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a "sacred union".' 

In 1996 when Barack Obama ran for statewide office in Illinois for the first time, he told a Chicago newspaper called Outlines that 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages'

By 1998 Obama's transformation into a more cautious – and electable – politician had begun; he told the same paper that he was 'undecided' about marriage rights for gays and lesbians

That duplicity reached its apex during a 2008 appearance at Pastor Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, a wellspring of American evangelical Christian thought. 

'I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman,' he said then. 'Now, for me as a Christian – for me – for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God's in the mix.'

And just two days before he would be elected president, he told an interview on MTV that 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.'

Six months into his first term as president, Obama would ask Congress to repeal the Defense Of Marriage Act, an anti-gay-unions law. THe following year he told a group of liberal bloggers that he was having a change of heart.

'Attitudes evolve, including mine,' Obama said then.

On Tuesday he repositioned his personal slipstream of policy shifts as a much narrower matter of semantics driven by hurt feelings.

'Where my evolution took place,' Obama said in his Buzzfeed interview, 'was not in my attitude toward same-sex couples. It was in understanding the pain and the sense of stigma that was being placed on same-sex couples who are friends of mine, where they’d say, "You know what, if you’re not calling it marriage, it doesn’t feel like the same thing. Even if you gave me the same rights, the fact that I’m being treated differently or the love that we feel is somehow segmented off, that hurts".'

'It was because of those conversations that I ended up shifting positions,' he explained – 'that civil unions, in fact, were not sufficient rather than marriage.'

'But I think the notion that somehow I was always in favor of marriage per se isn’t quite accurate.'

If he was having a change of heart, Axelrod writes, it was in the process of returning to his true feelings.

'If Obama's views were "evolving" publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors,' he relates in his book. 

'The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed – and having watched him struggle with this issue for years, I was ready, too.'

HIDE THE BALL: Two days before his first presidential election, he told an MTV audience that 'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.'

Time magazine got the first sneak peek at the section of the book, released Tuesday, that deals with Obama's on-again, off-again relationship with the gay marriage issue. 

Axelrod's recollections pair a picture of Obama as a tortured soul, unable to square his self-image as a tgruth teller with the reality of his political lie.

'Having prided himself on forthrightness, though, Obama never felt comfortable with his compromise and, no doubt, compromised position,' he writes. 'He routinely stumbled over the question when it came up in debates or interviews.' 

Axelrod writes that he recalls Obama telling him: 'I'm just not very good at bulls****ing' – a claim that Republicans would dispute.

Ultimately it was Vice President Joe Biden who flushed his boss out, saying on the Sunday morning 'Meet the Press' talk show that he was 'absolutely comfortable' with the idea of gay marriage.

WIth that, Obama had to come forward.

'Every single American – gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender – every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our society,' he said at an annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, America's leading gay-rights group.

FULL CIRCLE: Obama publicly said in 2012 what he had believed for years – that he backed marriage rights for homosexuals

And on May 9, 2012 in an interview with ABC News, he said: 'I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.'

Last month during an interview with a YouTube celebrity, the president said he hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will issue a ruling this year that would prevent states from banning gay marriage.

'I'm hopeful the Supreme Court comes to the right decision,' he said.

Axelrod's recollections might be taken with a grain of salt, since the first published excerpt from his book focused on a story that was later labeled 'ridiculous' and a 'lie.'

BELIEVABLE? Axelrod's book has already stirred controversy with a story about Mitt Romney that the former Republican nominee's closest personal aide says is a 'lie'

He claimed that during a post-election concession phone call in 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hinted to Obama that he won primarily on the strength of black voter turnout in inner cities. 

'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee,' Romney told the president, according to Axelrod's version of events.

But Romney's personal aide Garrett Jackson said he was in the room, listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and nothing like that conversation ever occurred.

The revelation appeared timed to affect the public standing of Romney if he had decided to run for president again in 2016. Ultimately, the former Massachusetts governor opted to stay on the sidelines.

'I just hope this lie is the work of David Axelrod and not the president,' Jackson told CBS. 'It's ridiculous. I was very disappointed they would make that up.'

Obama's sit-down with Buzzfeed is the latest in a series of occasions where the White House has given liberals in nontraditional media outlets rare access to the leader of the free world.

Last month three YouTube celebrities interviewed Obama, including one comedienne best known for eating Fruit Loops while sitting in a bathtub filled with milk and the cereal.

The folllowing day the president spoke with Vox, a newish left-wing website known for 'Voxsplaining' news concepts – and attracting digital slaps from people eager to correct its mistakes.

Buzzfeed's interview also covered topics related to Russia, the 2016 elections, the death of ISIS hostage Mayle Mueller, and companies' reactions to restrictions placed on them by the Affordable Care Act.
