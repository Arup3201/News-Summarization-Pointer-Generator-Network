La Liga are coming after the Premier League - with the Spanish top divison's president saying he wants the world's 500 best players.

The last two summers have seen top Premier League stars Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale depart for sunnier climes, and La Liga chief Javier Tebas says they're not finished.

'We are not going to stop. We want the best 500 players,' joked Tebas.

4. James Rodriguez - Monaco to Real Madrid - £60m

5. Kaka - AC Milan to Real Madrid - £56m

'We want to make sure we have the biggest clubs and also the best players from the whole world in our league.'

Real Madrid have added to their considerable firepower by spending big 
on James Rodriguez and Manchester United's long-term target Toni Kroos.

Other stars on English sides' wanted lists were France winger Antoine 
Greizmann and Mario Mandzukic - both snapped up by last year's champions
 Atletico Madrid. 

In Real and Sevilla, La Liga boasts both the Champions League and Europa League winners - and the big spending this summer shows the clubs have no intention of stopping in their quest for a period of domination.

While some sides have suffered from huge debts and financial problems it doesn't seem to be stopping them pushing towards what president Tebas wants. Even Valencia, whose money issues have long caused issues - splashed out £15million on Benfica's Andre Gomes.

The Premier League has got a lot of work on its hands to make up on lost ground.
