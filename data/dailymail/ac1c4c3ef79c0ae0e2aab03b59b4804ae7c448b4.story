The average British adult has just seven years of complete financial freedom to look forward to, a report revealed yesterday.

Researchers found the majority of us will only enjoy a brief ‘window of wealth’ between the ages of 58 and 65.

This is the point at which debts have been cleared, kids have left home and a full-time wage still lands in the bank every month.

'Wealth window': The average Briton has just seven years of complete financial freedom and it is not before the children have left home and while they are still earning a full-time wage

But just seven years later regular income ceases and we will be forced to live on a reduced retirement income.

The figures emerged in a detailed study carried out by Skipton Building Society.

Skipton’s Head of Corporate Communications, Tracy Fletcher, said: 'This study offers a glimmer of hope for those hard-working young people who are currently strapped for cash and can’t see light at the end of the tunnel.

'As an adult there will be financial commitments throughout your working life, but you can get to the point, albeit potentially quite brief, where things ease up and you finally have a little money to spend on yourself.

'The mid to late 50s can be the point where you stop forking out for your children’s education, cars, weddings and rent.

'If you are tied into a 25 year mortgage this might also be the time when you’ve cleared the balance.

'But our findings also highlight the fact that, particularly in the current climate, it’s more important than ever for people to get on top of their finances when they are younger, in order to boost their chances of achieving more comfortable later years.'

Three quarters of the 1,000 people over the age of 55 who were polled claimed they had very little disposable income during their 20s, 30s and 40s.

Little disposable income: During people's 20s, 30s and 40s most most money went towards paying the bills, supporting the children, payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans

During this time, most money went towards paying the bills, supporting the children, payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans.

But four in 10 anticipate being richer towards the tail end of their career as they finally start to enjoy their hard-earned cash.

The study shows the average 55-year-old embarked on their first full time job at age 18, settled down with a partner by 24 and started a family two years later.

A house was purchased at age 27 and the mortgage finally cleared by age 53.

By the age of 52 the children finally flew the nest for good and most parents stopped supporting them a year later.

Healthy savings: The average person was able to save £20,335 by the age of 50 but 61 per cent wished they had saved more

The average respondent believes all 
their debts - loans, credit cards and store cards - will be cleared by 
age 58, and they intend to retire at 65.

When
asked how they intend to spend their money during their ‘window of 
wealth’, six in 10 plan to go on holiday, while 45 per cent will spend 
more money on doing up the house.

A further three in 10 would like to eat out more, while 22 per cent will socialise with friends.

The survey shows that more than half of those polled did save during their 20s, 30s and 40s despite other financial commitments.

The average person managed to save a healthy £20,335 by the age of 50, but 61 per cent still wish they had saved more by this point.

Only three per cent of people over the age of 55 are currently supporting elderly relatives, and those who are helping out financially anticipate doing so until they turn 65.

Tracy Fletcher added: 'The 1,000 adults we polled have been relatively sensible with the spending and savings habits over the past 30 or 40 years, but despite this are left with just a small window of spending at the end of it all.

'There is a clear message that regardless of there being a time at which you might not have so many financial commitments, it is imperative that you start saving as early as possible to help prepare for a more comfortable future.

'And there is always the chance that by making sensible financial decisions, this window of wealth can be extended into the retirement years.'
