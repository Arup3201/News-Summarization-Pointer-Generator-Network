Rest in peace: Senior Airman Nick Alden was killed last year in Frankfurt; his two-year-old son William died Saturday

The two-year-old son of an American airman has died almost exactly a year after his father was killed by an Islamic terrorist.

Two-year-old William Alden was trying to reach something at the top of a dresser in the family’s Anderson, South Carolina home when it fell and crushed him.

The boy's father was Senior Airman Nick Alden of Williamston, who was killed in March 2011 outside an airport in Frankfurt, Germany, by Arid Uka - a Kosovan Albanian who shouted 'God is great' as he fired a handgun into the bus carrying Alden and other troops.

The family was preparing to leave for vacation when the boy died – the first time they would have gone on holiday since Alden was killed.

Don McCown, the deputy coroner for Anderson County, says William was trying to reach something on top of the dresser when it fell on him Saturday. 

He told the Associated Press that the boy lived at the home with his mother, Patricia Brooks Alden, and his five-year-old sister.

William died of asphyxiation, Mr MrCown said.

Sgt David Creamer told the Anderson Independent Mail: ‘This poor lady has suffered so much, it’s unbearable. I do hate it for her.’

He said authorities had ruled the boy’s death an accident after performing a recreation, and no one will be charged.

‘My heart goes out to the family,’ he said. ‘It is so sad, there’s not much else to say.’

be wearing protective clothing and would be OK but when he was shot he,

Arid Uka, an Islamic extremist born in Kosovo, was convicted of murdering both Alden, who was 25, and 21-year-old Airman Zachary Cuddeback at Frankfurt Airport last March.

Uka confessed he was targeting the U.S. military when he opened fire on a U.S. military bus at the airport.

Eyewitnesses to the attack said he yelled out Islamist slogans before firing the weapon.

The Kosovo Albanian who admitted killing two U.S. airmen at Frankfurt airport said he carried out the attack after watching a clip of a Muslim woman being raped by American soldiers, which he mistakenly thought was real.

Uki, said the night before the attack he had watched the video posted on Facebook, which turned out to be a scene from the 2007 Brian De Palma film 'Redacted'.

He said he then decided he should do anything possible to prevent more American soldiers from going to Afghanistan.

'I thought what I saw in that video these people would do in Afghanistan,' he told the court last year.

Alden was flown back to South Carolina and buried at M.J. ‘Dolly’ Cooper Veterans Cemetery in Anderson.

Prior to his death, he lived in England with his wife, Trish, and children, Lily and William. He was stationed at Lakenheath air field.

The airman, who graduated Palmetto High School in 2003, had been in Germany to train for deployment in Afghanistan.

At the Frankfurt airport, Uka approached the bus carrying the U.S. servicemen, asking in English if the bus was carrying Americans.

When answered in the affirmative, he boarded the bus and fatally shot Alden, and 21-year-old Airman First Class Zachary Cuddeback.

Two others were wounded in the attack.
