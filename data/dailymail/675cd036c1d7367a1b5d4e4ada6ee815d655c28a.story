Tuttosport list Destro (Roma), Dani Osvaldo (Inter Milan, on loan from Southampton), Simone Zaza (Sassuolo), Sebastian Giovinco (who is now unavailable after signing for Toronto from Juventus), Giampaolo Pazzini (currently at the club) and Stefano Okaka (Sampdoria) as the potential strikers to take the mantle at Milan. 

Destro though, has also been linked with a move to the Premier League. Reports have stated that Tottenham are in talks with Roma regarding a swap deal including defender Vlad Chiriches, while their north London rivals Arsenal are also said to be in the chase.  

La Gazzetta dello Sport also run with Milan's striker shortage as their main story, questioning Inzaghi's position as manager of the struggling Serie A club.

They also ask whether Paul Pogba is really worth €100million as Premier League clubs continue to keep a close eye on his situation.

In Spain, AS lead with Real Madrid's signing of Lucas Silva from Brazilian side Cruzeiro. The 21-year-old midfielder, who spoke of his desire to follow in the footsteps of Toni Kroos, claimed in a press conference that he is 'at more than 80 per cent' after a week in pre-season with his former club.

He was presented at Los Blancos on Monday and after training with the team that evening, hopes to be able to play on Saturday.
