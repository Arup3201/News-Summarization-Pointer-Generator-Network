Scottish lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has vowed to move to England if Scotland votes for independence following last night's bruising TV debate.

Ms Mone said she would take her business to London in the event of a 'Yes' vote in next month's referendum.

Following last night's debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, Ms Mone took to Twitter to slam the dangers of walking away from the UK.

She said an independent Scotland's deficit would be too high and was concerned about losing the pound. Ms Mone also attacked the divisive impact of the independence debate after receiving a barrage of abuse from nationalists online.

Ms Mone said she was worried about the size of the deficit, jobs, oil and the pound in an independent Scotland

Ms Mone's remarks came after Mr Salmond last night crushed Mr Darling in the second independence debate - just three weeks before the country goes to the polls on September 18.

Mr Salmond easily won the contest according to a snap poll. Some 71 per cent of voters said the SNP leader was the victor. Just 29 per cent thought Mr Darling had won the contest.

But asked by a follower on Twitter if she would stay in Scotland if voters chose independence, the mother-of-three replied: ‘I'm off if it is.’ 

She added: ‘I said 2 years ago that I would leave if it was a Yes.’

She said: ‘Last point. We are stronger as a nation together. We don't own the £1, oil etc. Deficit is too high, bad for biz/jobs.’

After receiving a stream of Twitter abuse in response, Ms Mone added: ‘Can't believe the amount of hatred this vote is causing. It's extremely sad & will no doubt cause damage either way to the country I love.’

One follower wrote: ‘The quicker we vote yes, the quicker u get to f*** ya tramp!"

Ms Mone replied: ‘Why are you "Yes" voters so angry & abusive? Be professional.’

Two years ago Ms Mone said she felt Scotland could not survive on its own as ‘everything would go up’.

First Minister Alex Salmond has said that under independence business tax would be lowered.

He also pointed out then to the BBC's Andrew Marr show that Ms Mone had made a similar threat before the 2007 Scottish elections.

Ms Mone's remarks come after Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond clashed over independence in last night's second and final debate

Ms Mone, co-owner of MJM International and creator of lingerie brand Ultimo said previously: ‘I will move my business and I will move personally.

‘I don't think we can survive on our own and I think it would be really bad for business.

‘Everything would go up and I really don't think we need it at the moment.’

Ms Mone, from Glasgow, who was awarded an OBE in 2010, ranks among the UK's most successful businesswomen.
