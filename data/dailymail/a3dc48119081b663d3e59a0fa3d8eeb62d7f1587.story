Police stopped the train minutes later and detained Whitington, ABC reported.

The suspect has been charged with one count of robbery and placed in custody with a bond of $5,000.

However, he was more than happy to comply with proceedings - and gave a toothy grin after hearing his charge.

He will appear before a judge at Denver County Court on Tuesday.

Whitington is not the only detainee to appear happy in the face of a potential conviction.
