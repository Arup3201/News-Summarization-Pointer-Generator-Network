From tomorrow, travellers in the UK will be able to stay at Britain's newest quirky holiday experience: 'the Hotel VW California'.

The Hotel VW California promises to give Brits an unusual holiday. Comprised of six VW California Camper Vans instead of traditional hotel rooms, the hotel launches in Henley this weekend.

Guests will get the first ever chance to sleep on the beautiful Temple Island - made famous by the Henley Royal Regatta and its ornamental folly - for just £35 a night, with all proceeds going to charity.

The innovative hotel chain has been 
created in a bid to encourage more British families to embrace UK 
adventure holidays with a partnership between Volkswagen and 
LateRooms.com. 

The Hotel VW California will be situated around some of the UK's most beautiful and bold locations this summer. 

The temple boasts, among other features, wall paintings thought to be the earliest surviving Etruscan works in Britain, possibly dating back to the 7th century.

Each California provides sleeping for up to four adults and features a pop-up roof, kitchen with fridge, twin-burner cooker and sink with running water.

Discreet, integrated blinds on windows in the living area provide privacy while LED spotlights provide atmospheric illumination.

The vans also have an awning with table and two chairs to allow guests to enjoy the sun and riverside view.

Volkswagen claim the Hotel VW California offers fantastic value as 'most private islands will set you back in the region of £18,000 a night'.

The company adds: 'A lockable glove compartment is a more than a capable replacement for the traditional hotel safe.

'Meanwhile, the Thatcham Category 1 Alarm and immobiliser with tow away protection ensures guests' belongings are safe when they're out exploring the local area.'

The vans have been set up to offer free wifi and iPod docking as well as 'Climatronic' three-zone automatic air-conditioning, heated seats and programmable central heating.

Guests will also benefit from private boat transfers to ensure exploration of the surrounding mainland is also an option.

'Private island retreats are the epitome of luxury accommodation,' said Nicola Burnside, of Volkswagen.

'Hotel VW California provides a truly unique experience with all of the luxury and none of the expense. It is the perfect demonstration of the getaway you can enjoy with a bit of imagination and creativity.

Martin Solly from LateRooms.com, added: 'We're very proud to offer a supremely diverse range of hotels and it doesn't get much more unique than Hotel VW California.

'The location provides the ultimate island getaway. Combined with stunning views and nearby attractions this is a genuinely brilliant offer...There can't be another island in the world that offers such great value."

The VW Island offering will be available to book from July 24 for a limited time, and the six vans will then go on a tour of the UK, offering similar accommodation in other locations.
