Costly change: A move to ban councils from putting street lights on electricity poles could cost town halls 'millions of pounds'

Villages and towns across the country face reductions in street lighting because of a health and safety ruling.

For years, councils have fixed street lights to poles belonging to electricity firms, saving money and reducing street clutter. Phone companies used them too, combining three services in one pole.

However, the practice is under threat following the death of a BT engineer who was electrocuted while working on an electricity network pole.

Councils may have to erect their own poles for street lights, at a cost of around £1,000 each.

Parish and town councils are saying they just don’t have the money, so street lights will have to be turned off instead.

The National Association for Local 
Councils is seeking urgent talks with the Government over the 
policy which it estimates will cost authorities 'millions of pounds.'

A spokesman said: 'The National Association is extremely worried about the situation which arisen from this policy.

'The cost to local councils to maintain 
existing lighting with new types of poles is going to be 
disproportionate to the overall budgets of these councils.

'We know that in a small rural parish 
council in Cumbria that the costs could amount to £65,000; which is 
greater than its total annual budget.

'There is a risk that in some areas of 
the country there will be darkness which then is a risk to the 
vulnerable in our society and this is not right.'

Dan McLean of the Campaign to Protect 
Rural England (CPRE) said: 'It’s daft really. What we don’t want is more
infrastructure such as 'street furniture' being put up.

'There is no point having three poles next to each other, each carrying one service, when one pole will do.

'Surely people can be trained in the 
necessary safety procedures and the electricity, local authorities and 
communications services can collaborate with each other. That is the 
sensible option.'

Catalyst: The policy follows the death of a BT engineer

The ban on hosting street lights was revealed by Electricity North West's chief executive, Steve Johnson. He says other companies are taking the same action.

Mr Johnson says other electricity companies across the UK are taking the same action.

Street lights are thought to deter crime and there are fears the move could lead to an upsurge in muggings, thefts and burglaries.

The move has horrified the parish of Beetham in Cumbria, which has just 1,724 residents and about 40 lamps fitted to electricity poles.

The council estimates it would cost £40,000 to replace them, twice its total annual expenditure.

Councillor Pru Jupe said: 'The Government is doing nothing at all to help. There is just no money to do this work and we will have to turn off all lights affected in this way if nothing is done to help.'

She said town and parish councils would be saddled with massive debt due to the change in health and safety policy.

'I appreciate that it is very sad that someone died after climbing an electric wire pole,' she said.

'However, we don’t have chapter and verse as to the exact circumstances and it seems to me that the key issue is training.

'We don’t close all roads, or stop people driving on them because of one single accident. The response has surely to be proportionate.'

A spokesman for Electricity North West said councils were alerted of this safety requirement two years ago to allow time to plan for the change.

'We have not sought to remove all such equipment immediately, rather we have phased the work over several years as part of our routine refurbishment work on electricity poles.

'We will continue to give councils six months notice when we will be removing the lighting from our poles.'

Tim Field of Energy Networks Association said: 'There is no obligation within the standard for a network provider to allow any attachments from third parties on their equipment, and each network operator will make decisions based on their own risk assessment.'
