Oakland firefighter Keith Jones was off-duty and with his sons at the firehouse when a cop confronted them with his weapon drawn

A new video has revealed the terrifying moment that a police officer drew his weapon at a black firefighter and his two young sons at a firehouse.

Oakland firefighter Keith Jones was off-duty and with his boys, aged nine and 12, when he passed a station house and noticed that the garage doors were lying open on August 15.

As he went to close the doors at Station 29, an Oakland police officer confronted the family.

Video from the police officer's chest camera was published by KPIX on Wednesday.

On the footage, which is almost entirely dark, the cop can be heard telling Jones to put his hands up.

Mr Jones, 43, responded: 'I'm an Oakland firefighter. That's my truck right there.'

The father also told the police officer: 'I respect what you’re doing... It’s not a problem.'

The father told KPIX that he thought the officer was going to shoot him, saying the officer was in a crouched position ready to fire his gun.

Mr Jones, a 16-year veteran with the city's fire department, added: 'If we were white, I truly believe he would not have approached my kids that way.'

On the video, the firefighter can be heard trying to calm one of his sons who is crying during the frightening interaction. 

Later on the tape, once the firefighter has handed over his ID, the officer, who has not been identified, can be heard apologizing for his mistake.

 'It's not a problem,' Mr Jones responds.

Mr Jones, pictured with his nine and 12-year-old sons, told KPIX that he believed the police officer would not have confronted him in that way if they were white

The incident happened close to 11pm as the father and sons headed home from an Oakland Raiders game. 

As they passed the fire house, where Mr Jones does not work, he noticed the garage doors were open and stopped his car to close them. 

SFGate reported that Oakland police said the Fire Department called them to ask if an officer could check on the doors at Station 29 because they had accidentally been left open by a crew who rushed out to a call. 

The Oakland chief of police told CBS that the officer acted within policy after reviewing the tape. Mr Jones had requested an internal affairs investigation at the police department. 

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Oakland Police Department.
