A bank worker tried to murder his topless masseuse girlfriend after he quit his job to start a business with her but then became jealous when a man smiled at her in a club.

Amish Kansagra opened a massage parlour with his Polish lover Anna Imporowicz, but he was angry that she attracted interest from other men, including her ex-boyfriend.

The couple fell out when a man smiled at Miss Imporowicz in a salsa club - and the next day Kansagra turned up at her home and stabbed her in the throat, saying: 'You will die today.'

He was today convicted of attempted murder at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, after a jury heard he had 'eyes like the devil' during his violent rampage.

Judge Susan Tapping said that Kansagra, 28, would face a 'lengthy sentence' for the crime after being found guilty.

The couple first started dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Miss Imporowicz, 35, who would give massages to naked customers while she was topless or wearing skimpy underwear.

He left his job at a bank and opened a massage parlour with her in Ealing, west London, but their relationship fell apart last June after the incident in a Holborn salsa club.

The court heard that the pair went home together that night, but Kansagra shoved Miss Imporowicz against a fridge, destroyed her phone and laptop and posted a picture of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.'

The next day, he turned up at her house in nearby Brentford armed with a knife which he had taken from the massage parlour.

Victim: Miss Imporowicz met the defendant because he was a massage customer of hers

Prosecutor Julian Jones told the jury: 'She saw Amish with the knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said, "You've made the wrong decision. You will die today."

'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying, "I love you. Don't do this."

'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes like the devil, and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.'

Miss Imporowicz tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant, Mr Jones continued. 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side.

'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.'

A retired nurse came to her aid, and as Kansagra fled the scene he told witnesses that Miss Imporowicz had inflicted the horrific injuries on himself.

The defendant initially ran away to Manchester, but he later turned himself in to police and claimed not to remember anything thanks to a three-day vodka binge.

'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him,' the prosecutor said. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.'

Kansagra was convicted by the jury of one count of attempted murder, but was found not guilty of assaulting Miss Imporowicz.

Before the trial he pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.

Kansagra was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 19.
