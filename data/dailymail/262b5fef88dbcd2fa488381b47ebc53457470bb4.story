An astonishing suggestion was put forward today that the four French hostages freed this week could have been ‘Islamised' during their time in captivity.

The claim emerged during an interview with far-right politician Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front.

Pierre Legrand, 28, Thierry Dol, 32, Daniel Larribe, 62, and Marc Feret, 46 were all captured in September 2010 during raids on a uranium mine near Arlit, northern Niger, where they were working for nuclear giant Areva.

The four men, who were held in Niger four more than three years, looked uncomfortably Islamic when they got back to France on Wednesday.

Ms Le Pen said 
she was ‘uneasy’ about the look the four men who were photographed arriving back on France soil.

Asked
on French radio to explain exactly what she meant, Ms Le Pen said: ‘You
understand perfectly well what I’m saying, because I think many French 
people felt the same way.

Overjoyed: Daniel Larribe is greeted by family members after being held in captivity for three years

Unanswered questions: The reunion came amid claims that more than £17million was paid for their release

Extreme: French far-right FN party president Marine Le Pen made the claims in an interview

‘They appeared very hesitant and reserved. Two had their beards trimmed in an astonishing way. And their clothes were very strange.’

Ms
Le Pen pointed to one of the men wearing an Arab scarf over his face, 
saying ‘All of this deserves a few explanations from them.’

Asked
directly if she thought the men – who had all been working for nuclear 
giant Areva – had been ‘Islamized’, Ms Le Pen said: ‘No, look, I’m not a
psychiatrist. I’m just expressing to you how I felt, and I think it was
shared by a certain number of French people.

‘I’m not going to go as far as coming up with theories, that wouldn’t be my place.’

Her
suggestion draws comparisons with American television show Homeland in 
which English actor Damian Lewis plays a US soldier who spends so long 
in Al Qaeda captivity that he returns to America as an Islamic 
terrorist.

It
came as Mr Hollande’s government continued to insist that no ransom was
paid, while a well-placed source told Le Monde that more than 17 
million pounds worth of cash came from ‘secret funds allocated to the 
intelligence services’.

Suggestions: In Homeland, English actor Damian Lewis plays a US soldier who spends so long in Al Qaeda captivity that he returns to America as an Islamic terrorist

Britain and America  have repeatedly warned against paying ransoms, saying it will encourage terrorism.

G8
leaders who met in Northern Ireland in June signed an agreement to 
‘unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists’ but did not 
impose a formal ban.

British
officials said at the time that Al-Qaeda-linked groups around the world
had made some 70 million dollars from hostages over the last two years.

Fearing for their lives: This image from September last year shows the men appearing in videos uploaded to the Mauritanian news website Sahara Medias when they were held in captivity by Al Qaeda

Vicki
Huddleston, the former US ambassador to Mali, said ransom payments were
‘helping AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb – the group which 
captured and held the Frenchmen) to grow strong, buy weapons and 
recruit.’

And Raffaello 
Pantucci, a senior research fellow in counter-terrorism at the Royal 
United Services Institute, said: ‘The US gets very angry about this... 
Some of the European governments have been seen as softer on this 
issue.’

Mr Pantucci added: 
‘The long-term effects of this are that, first, the groups will probably
do it again and second, it gives the organisation money.’

PR dream: Their release is a welcome boost for Francois Hollande, a day after a poll showed he is the most unpopular president in French history

Supporting them to the very end: Families, friends and activists demonstrating in Aix en Provence, southern France, in June to mark 1,000 days since the four French hostages were kidnapped
