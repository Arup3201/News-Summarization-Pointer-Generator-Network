Javier Zanetti marked his final Inter Milan appearance at the San Siro on a high as they beat Lazio 4-1 on Saturday.

The 40-year-old, who will retire at the end of season, replaced Brazilian right-back Jonathan in the 52nd minute to a rapturous applause from the Inter supporters.

Tributes to Zanetti were evident throughout the game. The Nerazzuri legend came on to Europe's 'Final Countdown' during the second-half as he wore a commemorative armband sporting every Inter Milan player's name that he had ever played with.

In addition, his teammates wore jackets 
bearing his number and after the match the defender was treated to a 
montage of his career as the home fans gave him a standing ovation 
during his farewell presentation.

In his 
863rd appeareance for the San Siro outfit the former Argentina 
international ended the match on the winning side as a first-half brace 
from Rodrigo Palacio and a Mauro Icardi strike cancelled out Lazio's 
opener scored by Giuseppe Biava.

Brazil
 international Hernanes completed the rout against his former club late 
in the second-half as Inter stengthened their grip on qualification for 
the Europa League next season.

The emotion of the occasion was too much for one Inter fan who ran onto the pitch during injury time to hug the defender, who returned the favour whilst ushering to the side off the pitch.
