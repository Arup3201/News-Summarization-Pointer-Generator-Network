Skype has stepped up its attempts to corner the smartphone conference call market as competition grows from Apple, Google and Facebook.

The internet phone firm has agreed to buy GroupMe, which runs a phone application for users to text and make conference calls with others.

New York-based GroupMe, which has existed for just a year, was expected to be bought by the Luxembourg company for $80million on Monday.

‘We think the mobile group messaging space is very important,’ Skype chief executive Tony Bates said. ‘It means furthering the breaking down of barriers to global communications.’

Some entrepreneurs said it’s a good time to sell the firm, which has raised $11.5million from investors, reported the Wall Street Journal.

‘There was perfect alignment,’ said GroupMe co-founder Steve Martocci. ‘There are a lot of different areas where we can integrate.’

It comes as huge technology firms such as Apple, Google and Facebook are launching their own smartphone messaging services.

Changing hands: Microsoft is still trying to get the approval of European Commission regulators to complete an $8.5billion purchase of Skype

The firm was founded last year and its app allows friends or colleagues to communicate in private groups on their mobile phones.

The service currently sends around 100 million messages per month.

GroupMe could be a great asset for the software company on its Windows-based mobile operating system, reported the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved Microsoft’s purchase of Skype in June.

Internet companies are trying to get into the mobile market as they look for an alternative to texting and the BlackBerry Messenger app.

Group Me’s applications will continue to exist separately for now but all of the firm's 20 employees will eventually be joining Skype.
