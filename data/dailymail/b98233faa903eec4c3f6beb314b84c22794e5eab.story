Several major U.S. museums have banned selfie sticks - extendable smartphone devices which allow photos to be taken from up to a meter away - on the grounds of safety concerns.

Despite the growing army of selfie-obsessed tourists and locals alike who trudge through the world brandishing their pole-equipped camera phones, many establishments feel they pose multiple hazards.

'I am pro-selfie, just not pro-selfie stick,' the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's chief digital officer Sree Sreenivasan tells Mashable. 'I'm worried about visitor safety and protecting our art.'

Museums to have already banned the space-invading gadgets include New York's Museum of Modern Art and Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and 'enclosed spaces' in California's Getty Center.

The Met is still pondering whether a ban might be necessary, while the MoMA claims it has 'never' permitted visitors to take photos using camera-extension devices.

These safety concerns are not unfounded, even in the days before selfie sticks.

The Met suffered a mishap in 2010 when a woman fell and slashed a six-inch tear into Pablo Picasso’s The Actor painting, for example.

In 2006, a visitor at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, had a similar fall, this time 'demolishing' three Chinese Qing vases; and the same year, at the Milwaukee Art Museum, Gaston Lachaise's bronze Standing Woman statue was 'groped and vomited upon' during an after-hours museum party.

Mere humans, it appears, can pose quite enough of a risk on their own, without introducing long metal poles into the equation.

The selfie stick trend first emerged in Asia several years ago, before spreading worldwide and cementing its popularity over Christmas, when the gadgets became one of the bestselling gifts of the season.

With all its fans, however, the selfie stick has plenty of bans, extending far beyond museum walls.

Britain’s largest indoor venue, London’s O2 arena, recently banned them on health and safety grounds; as did the whole of South Korea, which has imposed steep fines for people using them due to the possible side effects of 'Bluetooth interference'.
