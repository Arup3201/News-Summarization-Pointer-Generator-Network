They insisted they would remain friends following their split in January, but things haven't exactly been cosy between exes Tulisa Contostavlos and Richard 'Fazer' Rawson.

Just two weeks ago, Tulisa was subjected to Twitter abuse from N-Dubz fans after she refused to offer her former bandmate and lover support as he released his debut solo single Killer.

So no doubt it was the awkward presence of both Tulisa and Fazer that was the big talking point at the MOBO Awards nominations party.

The exes joined a host of stars at the bash to announce this year's nominees of the Music Of Black Origin Awards, which will take place in Liverpool on November 3.

The X Factor judge, 24, showed off her curves in a tight dress with her blonde curls swept to the side.

She admitted it was strange to be up for an award without her N-Dubz bandmates, Dappy and Fazer.

She
said: 'It feels amazing. But pretty scary. It feels strange knowing all
the past years I've been here it's been with N-Dubz, so it's a weird 
experience.'

While Tulisa ended up with one nomination for Best Female, her ex-boyfriend missed out on one because he's only just launched his solo career.

However, it was newcomer Rita Ora and rapper Labrinth who scored the most nominations.

Following her three nods at the MTV EMAs earlier on Monday, the 21-year-old singer picked up four MOBO nominations, including Best Female, Best Video for RIP featuring Tinie Tempah, Best Album for Ora and Best Newcomer.

But in the Best Female category, the Hot Right Now hitmaker looks set to go head to head against pals Tulisa Contostavlos and Jessie J.

In a battle of the pop princesses, the trio will also face stiff competition from Rebecca Ferguson, Emeli Sande and Jessie Ware.

The
Next To Me singer is up for a prize in five categories - Best Female, 
Best R&B/Soul Act, Best Video, Best Song and Best Album - while the 
Ill Manors rapper is also up for Best Video, Best Song and Best Album as
well as Best Male and Best Hip Hop/Grime Act.

Singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran, whose 
music is considered guitar pop, was a surprise artist on the list with 
an impressive three nods.
