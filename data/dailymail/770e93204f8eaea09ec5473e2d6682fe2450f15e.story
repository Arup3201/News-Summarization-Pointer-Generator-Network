A 13-year-old girl was killed on Staten Island, New York, when the massive storm surge from Hurricane Sandy reduced her house to splinters.

Angela Dresch was found dead, her mother is in critical condition and her father is still missing after the small house was washed away.

Only the foundation, splintered debris and two shrubs were left at her home near the water’s edge in the Tottenville neighborhood.

The Staten Island Advance reports that Angela’s family was one of the few on her street to stay in their homes and try to weather the storm.

Their house was in one of the city’s mandatory evacuation zones.

Neighbors say they left for Tropical Storm Irene last year and returned only to find their house had been looted.

They did not want a repeat of that experience, the Advance reported.

Friends and relatives of the middle school student were devastated.

‘Seeing this makes me sick. Baby please come home to us. You were my everything,’ Tiffani Cropley wrote on a Facebook memorial page for the girl.

Tiffani’s mother Denise Elizabeth revealed that her daughter had been planning to go trick-or-treating with Angela on Halloween on Wednesday.

‘She's heartbroken and is numb. We will forever love and miss you. Ur smile we will never forget . RIP Angela Rose may god hold you in his arms,’ Ms Elizabeth wrote.

Another friend of Angela's, Alessia Randa, posted that the teenager's favourite colour was purple and that schoolmates should dress in the colour in tribute to her on their return to class.

Several homes on Yetman Avenue, where the Dreschs lived, were completely wiped away by the storm.

The neighborhood sit in a low-laying part of Staten Island, just feet from the shore.  It was no match for the 13-foot storm surge that the superstorm brought to New York City.
