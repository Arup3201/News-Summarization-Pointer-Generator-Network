A Rwandan woman hacked her husband to death with a machete for fear that he would infect her with HIV, local media reports.

Annonciata Kampororo, said to be middle aged, hatched a plot with her son and sister to kill her husband Anaclet Majyambere, 48, after he inherited his brother’s HIV-positive wife.

It is a tradition in some rural communities in Rwanda for a man to ‘inherit’ the widow of a family member in order to provide for them.

Murder: Annonciata Kampororo, said to be middle 
aged, hatched a plot with her son and sister to hack to death her 
husband Anaclet Majyambere, 48, with machetes after he inherited his 
brother's HIV-positive wife

It is believed the brother of Mr Majyambere, a resident in Gisagara in southern Rwanda, died of AIDS.

His wife, a local liquor seller, feared that the widow would also be infected and refused to sleep with Mr Majyambere until he took an HIV test.

When he refused to do so, she ‘withheld his conjugal rights’ and began planning the murder, Sowetanlive reported.

Downtown in the Rwandan capital, Kigali: Just 
over 3 per cent of the Rwandan population - between 180,000 and 250,000 
people - live with HIV. More than half are women and children, according
 to UNICEF statistics

One night, Kampororo, her son and her sister attacked Mr Majyambere with machetes and pestles and killed him.

It is estimated that just over 3 per cent of the Rwandan population - between 180,000 and 250,000 people - live with HIV.

More than half are women and children, according to UNICEF statistics, and in 2011 a reported 170,000 children were orphans as a result of AIDS.
