A taxi driver has been accused of appalling behaviour after posting secret reviews of his passengers online based on how generous they are.

Richard Evans had been taking pictures of his fares and posted them online with a rating based on how much they left as a tip.

The father-of-two of Llanelli, west Wales, even included the customer's name and address with a comment about if they left any gratuity.

Taxi driver Richard Evans snapped these secret pictures of his passengers and posted them on Twitter along with a review based on if they left a tip

But the 44-year-old has been slammed by other drivers because he is so scathing about the passengers who only pay the standard fare.

In one of the reviews, which he shared with his 1,800 followers on Twitter he wrote: 'No tip - tight a***' while in another he described as another passenger as 'Shrek' due to his bulky appearance.

In another he praises one of his passengers saying: '50p tip, keep the change, nice guy.'

The tweets, which were shared with other taxi drivers in the town have now been deleted. 

Posting this picture of one of his passengers online, he wrote the caption, '50p tip #keepthechange nice lady 

In his online reviews he wrote about the female passenger, left saying, '50p tip #keepthechange' and for the male fare right he said: 'keepthechange niceguy' 

But some have called for him to be barred from picking up passengers in his white seven-set Renault Scenic.

Llanelli councillor John Jenkins said: “It sounds like it has quite a disturbing side to it.

'I’m pretty sure the licensing department would take a very dim view of it.'

However, Mr Evans, who was retweeted more than 5,000 times, today defended the reviews, saying they were just meant to be a joke.

He said: 'It was just meant to be a bit of fun and I didn't want to offend anyone. 

'Yes I took pictures of four or five customers with my comments for my friends to see. It was all just a joke.

'I apologise if anyone has been upset and I will take them down. I value all my customers and I want them to be happy.'

Mr Evans, who was retweeted more than 5,000 times, today said they were just meant to be a joke.

Mr Evans has since apologised for posting the reviews on Twitter  and will apologise to anyone who is upset

However, Peter Eglitis, who runs Eastside Cabs in nearby Swansea said: 'That is appalling.

'Such behaviour is very much frowned upon in the taxi community and when something like this happens it is very poor for the trade.”

'This guy does not sound like a fit and proper person and should not be granted his licence.

'If that happened at my company we would suspend him straight away - it is very, very bad.

'Our priority is the safety of the customer and confidentiality is paramount.'
