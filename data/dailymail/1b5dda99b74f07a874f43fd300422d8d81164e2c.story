A cash-strapped council has angered residents by spending £1,000 of public money on a spoof Frank Sinatra music video about potholes.

The video was intended to promote Worcestershire County Council's highways department and its work.

However, with road damage in Worcestershire at record levels, locals were left wondering why the council was taking time out to make a parody of Sinatra's classic 'My Way'.

Sinatra parody: Worcestershire Highways Manager Jon Fraser donned a dinner jacket to recreate some Rat Pack magic

Raising awareness: Worcestershire Council argued that it was an efficient way to get their pothole awareness message attention

In the four-minute clip, which took 36 hours to edit, Highways Manager Jon Fraser takes a starring role as Old Blue Eyes wearing a dinner jacket while he croons along country roads and an office.

The lyrics to  'Right Here in Highways' include the seemingly inappropriate line: 'At work, our days our full'.

Fraser gives David Brent a run for his money, singing lines like 'Complaints, we get a few/But those we do, we're glad you mention.'

He goes on: 'We'll fill the holes, without exemption/We'll lay, each tarmac course/Not when it's wet, but on a dry day'

Hard work: The comedy cover took almost £1,000 and 36 hours to edit

Hoping for a hit: Jon Fraser, Worcestershire Highways Manager, said that he hoped it would be as popular as Torfaen Council's 'In The Depot'

Some £113million was spent last year filling in the pot-holes but the spending is barely keeping pace with the maintenance backlog across England and Wales.

Worcestershire Council had hoped to emulate the popularity of Wales' Torfaen Council which a viral hit with an Elvis-inspired ode to its gritters called 'In The Depot'.

Fraser explained: 'Torfaen Council's video, which has had over 470,000 views on YouTube, is a brilliant way to raise awareness of the tough job councils do to support residents and businesses through maintaining the roads throughout Winter.' 

Fraser said he was 'inspired' by 'In The Depot' and he hoped that his video 'broadcasts a serious and important message about the value of reporting potholes in an enjoyable way'.

However the council, which is looking to slash £100m from its budget, was criticised by residents and campaigners for wasting public money. 

'Drivel': Worcestershire residents complained on YouTube when the video went up, wondering why the Council were not just fixing the potholes rather than singing about them

Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the 
TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Worcestershire County Council should worry 
more about fixing the roads than singing about them.

'An amusing video will be zero comfort to motorists dodging potholes on the highways.'

'This idea should never have got off the drawing board and instead transport chiefs should have spent their time and taxpayers' money doing something useful.'

The video drew abuse when it was uploaded to Youtube yesterday.

Leon Smy wrote: 'Looks to me like far too much time and effort creating this total waste of time instead of actually doing what you promise to do.

'This is a really poor show. Far more important things for the council to spend the funding on than uploading drivel like this to Youtube.'

'Bad timing': Derek Jones from near Worcester said of the pothole crisis, 'it's almost as though the only answer they've got is to make an embarrassing video'

User Rh3na added: 'So you think it's a good idea to blow council tax payers money on making a video? how much have we paid for this while Worcester services are cut.'

'What purpose does this serve apart from a back slapping exercise for people who should be working for us not exercising egos.

'Pathetic truly pathetic you should be ashamed of yourselves.'

Belt-tightening: The Council was seen to be splurging money on a publicity video when taxpayers are demanding better value for money from all their services

Derek Jones, 54, of Norton, near Worcester, suffered £165 damage to his car on the county's roads last week.

Mr Jones, who had a compensation claim rejected, said: 'I think it's stupid and sums up their mentality.'

'It's terribly bad timing, it's almost as though the only answer they've got is to make an embarrassing video with all those blokes in the background, it's disgusting.'

It was reported last week workers 
from the council are repairing a 200 potholes a day, and have 
filled in almost 5,000 since the start of the year.
