The US government has released new satellite pictures which it said showed Russian forces were still near the Ukrainian border in recent days, contradicting Russian assertions they had been withdrawn.

President Vladimir Putin announced last Wednesday that the troops had moved, but NATO and the US both said they had seen no sign of a Russian withdrawal from the frontier.

NATO officials have previously estimated Russia has around 40,000 soldiers close to Ukraine's border, exacerbating the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War.

The photos showed what appeared to be about 20 Russian helicopters at Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border, on May 9. Alongside it, the US government published another image of the same area on March 26, also showing helicopters. An earlier photograph, from March 22, showed no helicopters in the area

The commercial satellite photos, published by the US State Department and on the US Mission to NATO's Twitter account, showed what appeared to be about 20 Russian helicopters at Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border, on May 9.

Alongside it, the US government published another image of the same area on March 26, also showing helicopters. An earlier photograph, from March 22, showed no helicopters in the area.

A second satellite photograph, taken in the Rostov area on May 12, within 75 km (50 miles) of the Ukraine border, showed what the U.S. government said was a group of Russian armoured vehicles.

The vehicles were also there in an earlier picture of the same area, dated March 23.

Colonel Martin Downie, spokesman for Allied Command Operations at NATO, said recent comments by Russia's leadership on a troop withdrawal did not reflect realities on the ground.

'The reality is that Russia continues to have 40,000 high-readiness troops massed on Ukraine's border and another 25,000 troops in Crimea. The units on the latest satellite pictures show mechanised infantry, armoured vehicles and combat helicopters,' he said in a statement.

'These units are there to intimidate Ukraine's government and they could be used for an invasion of Ukraine, if ordered by Moscow. We will continue to keep a close eye on Russia's actions near our borders,' he said.

The two-week exercises in rescuing submarine crews, held in the Gulf of Gdansk in Poland, involves 14 ships, including three submarines, airplanes, helicopters, diving and medical crews from 18 countries

When NATO published similar satellite photographs in April showing a Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border, a Russian official disputed their authenticity, saying the images were from August last year.

The allegation was denied by NATO officials, who said the photographs were recent.

Ukraine is not a member of NATO and NATO officials have said the alliance will not get involved there militarily.

NATO countries have sent planes, ships and some soldiers to reinforce eastern European members of NATO concerned about their security following Russia's annexation of Crimea.

'Combat helicopter with UN markings' spotted in East Ukraine

Video has emerged of a combat helicopter with UN markings in East Ukraine where it was allegedly used against pro-Russian separatists.

The Mi-24 chopper was one of four such helicopters spotted near the Donetsk Oblast city of Kramatorsk by Russia's Life News.

A spokesperson for UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said any use of peacekeeping 
equipment, bearing the name of the UN, for non-peacekeeping purposes, 
would contravene UN rules.

His office stressed that equipment marked with UN logos could only be used for UN-sanctioned tasks.

'It is the responsibility of Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) that provide Contingent Owned Equipment to peacekeeping missions to remove all logos and signage bearing the UN's name once such equipment has been repatriated to the home country or is no longer being used for official UN purposes,' Ban's office said.

The footage has yet to be verified.

Roadmap for peace? Ukraine reluctantly agrees to talks

The Ukrainian government reluctantly agreed to launch talks on decentralising power today as part of a European-backed peace plan, but did not invite its main foes, the pro-Russia insurgents who have declared independence in the east.

That deliberate oversight left it unclear what the negotiations might accomplish.

Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, was to chair the first in a series of round tables with national lawmakers, government figures and regional officials as part of a peace plan drafted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

The trans-Atlantic security and rights group also includes Russia and the United States.

Even as Yatsenyuk launched the talks he was dismissive of them, thanking the OSCE for its efforts but saying Ukraine has its own plan to end the crisis. He gave no details of that plan.

The road map aims to halt fighting between government forces and pro-Russia separatists who have taken over government buildings in the east and de-escalate tensions ahead of Ukraine's May 25 presidential vote. It lets the Ukrainian government decide specifics of the talks.

Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said the talks would involve 'regional elites' - expected to include former Ukrainian presidents, officials and lawmakers.

But he said the government would not stop its offensive to retake eastern cities now under the control of the separatists who declared independence on Monday.

'The government will act against those who are terrorising the region with arms in hand in line with the law, by continuing an anti-terrorist operation against them,' Turchynov said.

Insurgents in the east shrugged off the round table as meaningless.

'We haven't received any offers to join a round table and dialogue,' said Denis Pushilin, an insurgent leader in Donetsk.

'If the authorities in Kiev want a dialogue, they must come here. If we go to Kiev, they will arrest us.'

Even so, European officials applauded the start of the talks.
