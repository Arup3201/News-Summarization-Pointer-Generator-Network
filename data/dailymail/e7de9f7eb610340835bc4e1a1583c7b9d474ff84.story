It is less a holiday resort and more an enormous city by the beach.

The Bahamas is gearing up for a grand opening of grand proportions as the Caribbean's biggest mega-resort opens this month.

Costing a staggering $3.5billion, the super-development Baha Mar - The New Riviera will include five fully-distinct resort hotels and will stretch across 3,000ft of Nassau's pristine Cable Beach.

At a staggering $3.5 billion, the Baha Mar - The New Riviera, is the Caribbean's largest luxury resort project

Tourism, especially in the Bahamas, will never be the same again.

The integrated gaming resort will include a 100,000 square foot casino - the largest in the country - alongside 40 restaurants and bars, plenty of shops in its Waterside Palace promenade, the first-ever Tournament PlayersClub 18-hole golf course in the Bahamas, and The Racquet Club, a world-class tennis facility.

The Baha Mar Casino & Hotel will be the mega-resort's most impressive stand-alone property, offering 1,000 rooms and 105 suites and villas.

Of particular note is the VIP Villa Roxie, with interiors designed by singer Lenny Kravitz's design firm, boasting a private fitness room, massage room, media room and gaming room. 

The integrated gaming resort will feature five hotels, including The Baha Mar Casino & Hotel (pictured)

The 1000-room stand-alone property will be the largest of the mega-resort and also include 105 suites 

The hotel's 100,000 square foot casino is not to be missed - it's the largest in the country

Not to be outdone, there will also be a 700-room Grand Hyatt outfitted in traditional Bahamian colors and designs, an all-inclusive Melia resort, a Rosewood property and an SLS Lux hotel, known for its Las Vegas and Beverly Hills outposts.

All together, there will be over 3,000 rooms available to book, along with countless other timeshare and private rental home options. 

The Rosewood, with just 200 rooms and five beachfront villas, however, will be the smallest.

The Grand Hyatt will be the second largest hotel on site, with 700 rooms, a spa and plenty of pool space

The entire hotel will be decorated in traditional Bahamian style, including many bright colours

The rooms, some of which overlook the azure water, are outfitted in relaxing hues of white and pink

Guests are encouraged to meander through the property's extensive nature preserve, outfitted with boardwalks, as well as to take advantage of the opportunities for sea-kayaking through the mangrove forests and lagoons.

For those looking for a bit of pampering, the super-resort's 30,000 square foot ESPA is just the place, complete with breathtaking ocean views.

Of course, each of the individual hotels will have their own smaller spa, as well.

Another of the hotels to choose from will be the SLS Hotel, which is known for its Beverly Hills property

At the SLS LUX at Baha Mar, there will be 300 well-appointed rooms, including 107 private residences

The smallest of the five hotels that make up the mega-resort is the 200-room Rosewood Hotel

As well as the refined elegance of the Rosewood's spa, there will also be a 30,000 square foot ESPA 

For those looking for a bit more opulence, the hotel will also offer five beachfront villas

The sprawling grounds will also play host to a wide range of restaurants, bars and lounges, such as Japanese eatery Katsuya, a nightclub designed by rocker Lenny Kravitz, and the second location of Atlanta-based Bone's steakhouse. 

But what really sets this mega-resort apart from its Las Vegas counterparts is the stunning beachfront.

There's over half a mile of sandy oceanfront, as well as 'The Sanctuary,' which offers 20 acres worth of beach and pool experiences, including lagoon pools and streams.
