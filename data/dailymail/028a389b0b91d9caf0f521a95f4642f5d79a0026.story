Former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis has been questioned by Swiss police after her estranged husband said he was attacked by the tennis star and her family.

Thibault Hutin, a French equestrian athlete who married Miss Hingis in 2010, accused the 33-year-old and her mother of beating and scratching him before taking his valuables.

He also claimed that the mother’s boyfriend hit him with a DVD player during the alleged assault on September 23.

A police spokesman said the tennis star, her mother Melanie Molitor and her mother’s boyfriend Mario Widmer were interviewed last week.

The local justice department will decide possible further action, but no timetable has been set for a decision.

Mr Hutin, 26, spoke to the Swiss press last month about the alleged attack.

He claimed he was ‘beaten and scratched’ by Hingis and her mother, and then ‘whacked’ on the head with a DVD player by the mother’s boyfriend.

He said that he was so ‘terrified’ he had moved into a hotel and plans to return to his native France.

He added: ‘Naturally, my upbringing forbids me to hit women.’

Mr Hutin said that after fleeing he realised his wallet and credit cards were missing, and then returned with police to reclaim them.

‘I was shocked. I would never have thought it could go so far. I’m really afraid,’ he said.

The private life of the couple, who wed in 2010, had hit the headlines in July after Mr Hutin claimed Miss Hingis had destroyed their marriage with repeated infidelity.

Miss Hingis responded only by saying that the couple had separated at the start of the year.

Although she is still only 33, Hingis effectively retired from top-level tennis six years ago, following a series of injuries.

She had been a child prodigy who became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time when she won the Wimbledon doubles title in 1996, aged 15 years and nine months.

She was still 16 when she won Wimbledon in 1997, one of her five Grand Slam singles titles.

Ligament injuries in her ankles meant she stopped playing tennis in 2002, aged just 22. She returned to the game in 2006, but retired the following year.

She came out of retirement this year to play doubles with Daniela Hantuchova at tournaments including the U.S. Open, although it is not thought this was the beginning of a full-time return to the game.

Miss Hingis has declined to comment on the allegations.
