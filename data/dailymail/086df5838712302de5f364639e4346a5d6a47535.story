Blast: Da Bomb's Final Answer hot sauce is described as 'radioactive' in strength

A high school prank backfired after a 15-year-old boy was arrested for allegedly spiking a batch of marinara sauce with Da Bomb hot sauce.

Three canteen workers had to be taken to hospital, and other students and staff at the public school in Chicago reported rashes and trouble breathing after inhaling fumes from the sauce last month.

The teenager was charged as a juvenile for five counts of misdemeanor battery - and also ruined future pranks for his classmates after the school installed security cameras.

According to ABC News, the teenager 
allegedly sneaked into the canteen before the first lunch break and 
added the Da Bomb sauce to the food.Â 

'A student then went through the 
food line and purchased spaghetti with marinara sauce, and after sitting
down and taking his first bite, found it intolerably hot,' Highland Park Police Deputy 
Chief George Pfutzenreuter said.

Canteen staff removed the sauce, but 
when a couple of them tasted it they started to feel the side effects of
the super-hot sauce.

'Several staff and students reported 
reactions to the sauce, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of 
breath and skin rashes,' school spokesman Natalie 
Kaplan told ABC News.

Tests have not yet indicated which strength of Da Bomb was added to the sauce, but the hottest - Da Bomb Final Answer - is about the same strength as some self-defense pepper sprays.

It measures 1,500,000 on the Scoville Scale. Police grade pepper spray is about 5.3 million on the scale.

The Da Bomb sauce is so hot that the company sells it in a locked box. Before purchasing it online, consumers must read a waiver that reiterates the strength of the sauce, said to be more than 100 times hotter than a jalapeno pepper.

Da Bomb also warns against using the potent sauce near children or pets.

The website describes Final Answer as the hottest sauce in its line, adding that is radioactive in strength.

It also says it should be used as a food additive, one drop at a time, before warning: 'Do NOT eat this sauce straight out of the jar! You will die.'

For the canteen staff who sampled the spiked marinara sauce, that must have been similar to how they felt. They had to be taken to hospital after just breathing in the fumes from the sauce.

The Final Answer sauce measures 1,500,000 on the Scoville scale. The scale for measuring the heat from peppers was invented by Wilbur Scoville in 1912.

When he first started using the scale, he used people to taste peppers and chiles and then measure how many parts of sugar water it took to stop the burning sensation.

The system has become more refined since, using a system to test for capsaicin in the peppers.

Feel the heat: Chicago's Highland Park School has installed security cameras after lunch was spiked

The student said to be behind the prank has not been named. He was arrested and charged after the school contacted a poison control department.

In an email sent to staff and students the school said that a hot sauce was 'inappropriately and deliberately' put into the marinara sauce, affecting several students and staff, according to NBC Chicago.

To prevent further high school japes, the school has installed a security camera in the canteen.
