In the end an entire season of blood, sweat and tears was decided by one man sitting in a lorry in a Twickenham car park.

This unimaginably tense game - taken to extra-time by two magnificently committed and professional teams - came down to the wire.

As Northampton desperately hurled themselves at Saracens’ battered, bruised and exhausted defenders it looked as if the north London side were going hold on for two more seconds to claim the Aviva Premiership title they so desperately craved.

But out of the gloom at the bottom of the ruck, a pair of hands - belonging to Alex Waller - reached out, inches from the line, and Northampton’s forwards celebrated.

Referee: JP Doyle (RFU)

Not for the first time in the game, 
referee JP Doyle was unsure whether to award the try and asked 
television match official Graham Hughes - sat in a broadcaster’s trailer
 behind the North Stand - for guidance. He had the Aviva  Premiership 
title in his hands and he immediately knew the magnitude of the call as a
 wry smile crossed his face.

‘I’m not sure if that was a try,’ Doyle said.

Nobody
 in the ground was. Eventually, after countless replays on the big 
screen, Hughes decided in Northampton’s favour. They had won their first
 Premiership title. Saracens players dropped to their knees, knowing 
their richly promising season had seen them finish empty-handed yet 
again.

The irony was, if 
fly-half Stephen Myler - or anyone else for that matter - had kicked a 
simple drop-goal attempt in the build-up to Waller’s contested try, with
 Saints having scored two tries to Saracens one, a final scoreline of 
20-20 at the end of extra-time would have handed the Midlanders the 
trophy anyway.

But they bet the house and won the lot.

‘I
 was sure I’d scored it but I just wasn’t sure if the cameras had seen 
it,’ said Waller, sporting a black eye from an earlier collision which 
had left him needing extensive treatment on the floor.

So close: Charlie Hodgson could have won the final for Saracens in normal time but his conversion hit the post

On the mark: Fly-half Owen Farrell kicked Saracens into an early 6-0 lead at Twickenham

‘Thankfully,
 it did. It was one of the most ferocious games I’ve  ever played in and
 the extra- time took its toll fitness-wise. It was an incredibly tough 
game.’

Technically, 
probably, awarding Waller’s try was the right decision. But it was also 
almost unimaginably cruel for a Saracens side who  finished the regular 
season nine points clear at the top of the table and are, on balance, 
the best side and deepest squad in England.

To
 compound the Londoner’s agony, they believed Owen Farrell had scored a 
legitimate try after 63 minutes only for Doyle to again defer to Hughes 
while the Saracens fly-half had treatment on the floor for a lower leg 
injury he sustained kicking the ball into the crowd in celebration.

With
 Alex Goode lining up the conversion, Hughes — who moments earlier had 
declined to refer a blatant forward pass from Luther Burrell to George 
North in the lead-up to George Pisi’s 58th-minute try — prompted Doyle 
by asking him ‘is there anything you’d like to check?’ and upon review 
he decided that Saracens full-back Alex Goode’s flicked pass to Chris 
Wyles was marginally forward and the ‘try’ was chalked off.

It prompted a furious response from chief executive Edward Griffiths after the game.

‘Most
 teams in the Premiership would say the protocol has become a shambles, 
it’s almost “make it up as you go along”,’ said Griffiths.

‘Some
 referees use the TMO as a kind of video operator, “show me that again 
please”, others take instruction, others take guidance.

‘This sounds like sour grapes but it isn’t, because this would be the case had that final try not been given.

‘The TMO process is a shambles.’

False dawn: Farrell (centre) thought he had scored Saracens' first try of the game but it was disallowed

Distraught: Farrell was replaced after injuring himself celebrating his disallowed try in the second-half

After
 last week’s crushing defeat to Toulon in the Heineken Cup final at the 
Millennium Stadium, it was astonishing to see the Saracens players 
flinging themselves into every contact as if it were the first game of 
the season.

The courage on display from both sides was remarkable, even by modern rugby’s standards.

In
 keeping with the warrior spirit which has served them so well all 
season, and led superbly by Steve Borthwick in his 265th and final 
Premiership appearance, Saracens refused to accept they were out of the 
match at 14-9 down with seven minutes to play and continued to press 
until Marcelo Bosch squeezed over in the corner to level proceedings.

Fly-half
 Charlie Hodgson — another player fortunate to still be on the pitch 
after being knocked into next week, seconds after replacing Farrell, by a
 thunderous hit from Courtney Lawes — hit the right-hand upright from 
the tightest of angles and match entered its extra time drama.

Up for grabs: Saracens and Northampton were competing for the Aviva Premiership trophy on Saturday

Passionate following: Northampton supporters were out in full force for their team at Twickenham

There are so many ‘what ifs?’ for Saracens.

What
 if Billy Vunipola, so desperate to win he was almost combusting, had 
not been penalised for crossing seven minutes into added time, leading 
to Jackson Wray’s effort being disallowed?

What if TMO Hughes had spotted Burrell’s earlier forward pass in the lead up to Pisi’s second-half try?

What if Hodgson had kicked that conversion?

But
 in the end this group of arch pragmatists, coached expertly by 
Ulsterman Mark McCall, will know there are no prizes for second place.

‘It
 was a strange game and a strange finish,’ said Myler. ‘We probably 
didn’t deserve to win because in a game like that it’s a shame either 
side has to lose.’

The 
debate on whether an entire season should be decided by one man watching
 a television screen in a truck will rage on. But this was high drama, 
no doubt.
