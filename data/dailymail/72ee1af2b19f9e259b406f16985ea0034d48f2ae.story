A sham wedding couple used crib sheets to memorise facts about each other before tying the knot in a bogus ceremony set up by a fixer, a court heard.

Moroccan Zakaria Azzouzi married Petra Tatalova, from Slovakia, in an attempt to stay in Britain after his visa expired.

The fraud went undetected for eight months - until police raided the house of the fixer who had arranged the fake marriage and found the notes used by the couple to learn their lines.

The crib sheet reminded them that the bride's star sign is scorpio, the groom's favourite food is couscous and they supposedly met in a coffee shop.

Happy couple? Petra Tatalova and Zakaria Azzouzi entered into a sham marriage to help him stay in Britain

Jailed: Azzouzi has been given a 21-month prison sentence while Tatalova was jailed for 12 months

Student Azzouzi, 24, was yesterday 
jailed for 21 months for his part in the scam, while Tatalova, 32, an 
events manager, was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

The 'couple' wed at Barnet registry 
office in north London in March 2011, because Azzouzi needed to marry an
 EU citizen to avoid being deported from the UK when his visa expired.

They claimed that had met in a coffee shop on Oxford Street in June 2010 and had been living together for six months before the wedding.

But in fact, they were introduced by 'fixer' Mourad Nabil, 43, who was described by a judge at St Albans Crown Court as having a 'Svengali-like malign influence' over the bride.

When police raided Nabil's home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire they discovered notes helping Azzouzi and Tatalova learn facts about each other in order to convince officials that their marriage was genuine.

At the bottom of the crib sheet, Nabil had written: 'That is about it honey.. try memorising these information sweety,, just in case.. you know me I am always thourough.. [sic]'.

Crib sheet: The pair were discovered when police found this sheet telling them facts about each other

Nabil, 43, who was earlier convicted of an £18,500 benefit fraud, was sentenced to two years in prison.

Laura
 Blackband, prosecuting, told the couple that the three defendants went 
to the registry office a month before the wedding to answer questions 
about their relationship, with Nabil claiming to act as their 
interpreter.

However, 
when the crib sheets were discovered later that year it became clear 
that the wedding was in fact 'a sham, bogus marriage', she continued.

'Mr
 Azzouzi's mother organised with Mr Nabil that he would secure a fake 
marriage so he could stay here as the husband of an EU national,' Ms 
Blackband said. 'It was an entire put-up job planned for Mr Azzouzi to 
stay in this country when his visa ran out in May 2011.'

She said that Tatalova, who first came to Britain in 2000, had previously been in a relationship with Nabil.

When
 he was questioned by police, Nabil said he had been 'intimate' with the
 bride but said that she had introduced Azzouzi to him as her boyfriend,
 adding that he did not get on with the groom.

'He
 accepted they were an odd couple,' Ms Blackband said. 'Mr Azzouzi was 
eight years younger and a Muslim from Morocco, and she was a Christian 
from Slovakia.

'He said it was a genuine marriage and that he had assisted with the preparations because Mr Azzouzi had a terrible memory.'

Tatalova told the police she met Azzouzi in Cafe Nero or Costa Coffee and that he had proposed to her on her birthday, sending her a card with the words 'Will you marry me?' written inside.

She also said it was a genuine marriage, but said he had 'upped and gone' and she did not know where he was.

Azzouzi had been arrested in Manchester for an unrelated offence around the time of the raid on Nabil's house - he originally stuck to the story, but once he was shown the crib sheet he confessed it was a sham marriage.

Tatalova, Azzouzi and and Nabil all pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration laws by arranging a bogus marriage, but were convicted by a jury.

An earlier trial began in December 2012, but was stopped when Azzouzi's mother was denied a visa to enter Britain and testify as a defence witness.

Azzouzi is set to be deported to Morocco immediately owing to the time he has already spent in jail and on an electronic tag.

Tatalova's lawyer said yesterday: 'It is a sad and desperate case for her. There was no gain in financial terms. The only explanation is that it was a misguided attempt by Miss Tatalova to assist. She paid the wedding expenses.

'She is ashamed to be here and is ashamed by the finding of the jury. She has always worked and never claimed benefit.'

Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'The sole purpose of the sham marriage was to allow Azzouzi to remain in the UK through his marriage to an EU national. This was a family-organised wedding orchestrated by Nabil.'

He told Tatalova: 'Why you became involved only you know. You have put all you have achieved in complete jeopardy by agreeing to go through this sham marriage. '

Paul Whitehead, from the Home Office's Criminal and Financial Investigations Team, said:  'Our discovery of the crib sheet was crucial to the investigation, blowing a hole in any claims to credibility that the defendants may have had.

'Couples who are in genuine relationships do not need aide-memoires to help them recall their partner's age, address and even name.'
