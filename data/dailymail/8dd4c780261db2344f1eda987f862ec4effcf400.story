Tom Ince believes goals should not be a problem for Hull City — despite manager Steve Bruce’s striker pursuit.

The Tigers remain in discussion with Blackburn over Jordan Rhodes, who scored his 54th goal in 100 games for Rovers on Saturday as they beat Bournemouth 3-2.

An initial bid of £8million was rejected though it is thought a fee of around £10m plus players could be agreed.

Bruce sold frontman Shane Long for £12m to Southampton earlier this month, then lost his £7m summer signing Robert Snodgrass to a knee injury for at least six months.

Ince, though, feels he and his attacking colleagues carry enough firepower to keep the opposition worried.

‘There is enough capability in this team to score goals,’ he said. ‘We are creating chances, it would be a worry if we weren’t. We would sit and say “how did we lose that game?” added the former Palace loanee.’

Hull were beaten 1-0 by Sporting Lokeren in Thursday’s Europa League play-off first leg, but opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory at QPR.

No value: Stoke manager Mark Hughes refuses to spend money in the transfer market just for the sake of it

Their next opponents Stoke, meanwhile, lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa but their manager Mark Hughes has insisted he had millions to spend this transfer window but simply could not find the right deals.

Summer recruitment has seen six players arrive and three go out for a net loss of just £1m — but Hughes doubts there will be any further arrivals.

‘We are in a position where we are quite happy with what we’ve got,’ the Welshman said. ‘We can’t guarantee we can have a transfer window like this every time but the chairman understands that.

‘We’re trying to make the club better and get good players here, which I think we are doing.

‘We wanted to spend the money but it has to be the right deal. If there are other opportunities we will pursue them.’
