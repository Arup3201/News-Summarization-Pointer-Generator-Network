Bell ringing, roast beef for Sunday lunch and watching the Red Arrows are among the things that define  Britain – at least according to the great and good.

In a special issue, Country Life magazine has created a comprehensive list of the ‘Best of Britain’ recruiting contributors from James Dyson to Jools Holland and from John Major to Princess Anne.

In a special issue entitled ‘our nation’s greatest glories’, the upmarket bible of rural Britain has enlisted the help of the great and the good in an attempt to define our nation.

Defining the nation: A traditional Sunday roast features on the 'Best of Britain' list compiled by Country Life magazine

The countryside and outdoor activities feature heavily throughout the list.

Thatched roofs and country cottages are included, as are Wellington boots – which are ‘an essential for fashionistas as farmers’.

The 1,000-year-old English oak, described as ‘an enduring symbol of Britain itself’, and grass lawns, described as ‘something of an obsession for British men’, both feature.

Our obsession with dog breeds is noted, particularly Jack Russells, lurchers, springer spaniels, setters and beagles which all have British origins.

However, the magazine admits that the nation’s favourite dog – the labrador – is in fact an import.

Explorers also make the list – from Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated race to the South Pole to Sir Ranulph Fiennes becoming the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest at the age of 65.

On the gastronomic side, stilton, apples, condiments such as HP Sauce and Branston Pickle, Scotch whisky and traditional afternoon tea are all key ingredients of Britain.

There is also a nod to the English language which is ‘not an easy tongue to master as it continues to grow and evolve at a rapid rate’, the magazine says.

Country Life also highlights the importance of the Queen, particularly with regard to the state opening of parliament, which she has done every session since she was crowned, except for in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant.

Former Prime Minister John Major said: ‘The Queen has been a constant, moving with the times – and indeed, often ahead of public opinion.

‘Time and again, she has instinctively gauged the pulse of our nation.

'For our country, the monarchy is a focus no politician can match.’
