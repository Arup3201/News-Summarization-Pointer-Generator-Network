The official paperwork formally announcing that George Clooney and his British fiancee Amal Alamuddin are getting married has been revealed.

The couple posted their official wedding banns in London, with the 53-year-old actor and his lawyer fiancee each paying £35 before signing the document at Chelsea Town Hall.

The legal notice of their intention to marry has to be displayed in public for 16 days before they are allowed to tie the knot.

The document lists the Oscar-winning star’s full name as George Timothy Clooney and his profession as ‘actor and director’.

Miss Alamuddin, 36, is described as a barrister. The banns, which went up a fortnight ago, describe Miss Alamuddin as single. Mr Clooney’s status is listed as ‘previous marriage dissolved’.

The banns also confirm that the couple will get married in Italy.

The couple met at a charity event and began dating in September last year. Mr Clooney proposed to Miss Alamuddin in April, presenting her with a seven-carat diamond engagement ring.

His Oxford-educated fiancee has a high-profile client list – she has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and is an advisor to former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.

The ceremony is thought to be taking place next month at Mr Clooney’s exclusive £25million holiday home by Lake Como.

It was revealed last month that Mr Clooney had persuaded the mayor to bring in laws to guarantee his privacy.

Local authorities will hit swimmers with a £450 fine if they are caught in the water within 100 metres of his mansion.

Pedestrians are also to be banned from stopping on the road outside the property.

The laws announced by Laglio Council will stay in operation 24 hours a day until September 30.

Laglio mayor Roberto Pozzi said at the time: ‘We have to guarantee privacy and security for George Clooney and his guests.’

Mr Clooney split from his former wife Talia Balsam in 1993, describing himself as a ‘lousy husband’.
