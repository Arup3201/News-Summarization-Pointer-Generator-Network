A teenage girl who went on her first ever sea fishing trip caught a yellow fin tuna weighing 250lb, despite being more interested in sunbathing than catching fish.

Five ft four Anna Meaden, had only ever been fly fishing for trout on a lake before she hooked the monster fish while visiting her father Paul on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic.

The 16-year-old was more interested in topping up her tan while on a day trip on a charter boat when she was persuaded to try her hand.

But Anna, who keeps fit playing rugby, was astounded when she hooked the giant fish within 20 minutes of putting a baited line into the ocean around 400 yards offshore.

It was then an hour and 15 minutes of hard slog as she battled to reel in her monster catch as the fish fought to get away.

The tuna was so big that it had to be lifted off the boat at Ascension Island capital Georgetown and placed on to a jetty by a US military crane.

Anna of Campsea Ashe near Woodbridge, Suffolk, arranged for the fish to be filleted and divided up into hundreds of portions to be shared out among the islanders.

She insisted that she had no interest in fishing before she was finally persuaded to take a trip out to sea with her father’s friends Colin Chester and Craig Hall, who own a charter boat.

Anna who is on Ascension Island with her friend Georgina Paterson, 20, for a five week summer holiday, said: 'I came out here to see dad for a bit of a break.

'To be honest we weren’t that interested in fishing. We were just on the front of the boat sunbathing when Craig started calling and saying that we were going through some fish. So we went over and gave it a go.

'There were three rods set up and we got bites on two of them. Craig tried to reel in one and it cut loose after five minutes.

'A tiny American woman took the other rod to reel it in, but she was struggling and wore herself out after a couple of minutes. She said it was more difficult than giving birth to two children.

'I then took over and strapped myself into the harness with the rod in a holster in metal plate in front of me. The fish took out around 400m of line and I kept having to heave the rod back and then reel it in when there was a bit of slack.

'It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It took me an hour and 15 minutes to reel it in. I’ve got bruises up my arm from banging against the reel and bruises on my legs from the metal plates.

'It was quite a struggle and a lot harder than you think. Craig caught a similar sized one as well but it only took him 15 minutes.

'Finally, I got the fish close enough to the boat for the crew to gaff it and drag it on board.

'Then I finished it off by clubbing it on the head. I got quite aggressive with it because I was so exhausted at fighting it for so long.'

Anna who is 5ft 4ins tall and plays as a tight head prop at Woodbridge Rugby Club, added: 'I have to keep fit to play rugby and I do a lot of training, so I am quite strong. I am sure that helped me.

'I’ve definitely got a taste for it - not normal fishing but definitely charter as I think that’s a lot more interesting.

'I’m coming out again at Christmas and I’d like to catch a marlin. Because this is such a small place and the tuna was so big we were able to give a bag of the meat to almost everyone on the island.'

Anna’s father Paul, who moved to the British overseas territory last May to work with the local police force after serving as a detective inspector with the Metropolitan Police in London, added: 'Unfortunately I wasn’t on the boat at the time.

'I was feeling quite proud and smug having recently caught a 231lb tuna, but Craig tells me that Anna made far less of a fuss about the fight than I did and that she’s a better fisherman all round.'

Anna’s mother Helen who is also on Ascension Island said: 'She did incredibly well catching the fish. The locals were very excited because two big tuna had been caught by the same boat.

'Everyone here is impressed with her. She has appeared in the local newsletter and she is being treated like a celebrity. Her fish has been spread around freezers all over the island.'
