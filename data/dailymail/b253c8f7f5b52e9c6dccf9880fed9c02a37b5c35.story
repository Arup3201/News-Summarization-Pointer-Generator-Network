A mother has described the terrifying moment when her daughter had a potentially fatal allergic reaction while they were stuck in rush-hour traffic before a Good Samaritan came to the rescue.

Jill Fowler's two-year-old daughter Mia has a nut allergy which flared up while they were on their way home from a play date last week.

Mrs Fowler, who is eight months' pregnant was driving her daughter home in Charlotte, North Carolina when she had an adverse reaction to a cookie.

The little girl began to have trouble breathing while the mother and daughter were stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Interstate 277.

Mrs Fowler told the Charlotte Observer: 'She started saying that the cookie was 
spicy. She was talking funny a little and acting a little
weird.

'Mia started crying, and I looked back, and she was drooling. You
could tell she was struggling breathing. And she started throwing up.'

Mrs Fowler pulled her SUV over immediately and slammed on the hazard lights.

However in a panic, the mother found she was shaking so much that she could not inject her daughter with the life-saving EpiPen which is used to treat anaphylactic shock.

It was then that a woman came out of the traffic to help them. After failing to inject Mia with the first pen, she succeeded in giving the little girl her medication with the second dose.

Mia began to show signs of improvement and was taken by ambulance to hospital to be checked over.

Her mother now desperately wants to thank the woman who came to their rescue, adding: 'I want her to understand that she helped save Miaâ€™s life.'
