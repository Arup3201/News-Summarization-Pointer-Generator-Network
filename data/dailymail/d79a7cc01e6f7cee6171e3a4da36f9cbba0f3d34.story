A woman brought in for questioning for sexually stalking and propositioning her preacher suddenly, without prompting, admitted to a ruthless 2004 murder.

Clara Rector is now charged in the killing of Tommy Hope of Camdenton, Missouri.

Police were first called about Rector last month when Jerry Sousley alerted them that his parishioner had been sending hem messages ‘regarding inappropriate matters of a sexual nature.’

Surprise: Clara Jean Rector, while being questioned for stalking the pastor of her Baptist church, suddenly told police she killed a man with a butcher knife in 2004

Basically, the pastor at Camdenton Bible Baptist Church said Rector, 36, was stalking him, reports the Kansas City Star.

Sousley said he found a notebook in which Rector had documented her fantasies with imaginary depictions of their shared sexual activities.

Sousley, who is married, says Rector also made advances, but when he turned her down she only came on stronger. He even says he began finding the notes on his car windshield.

In court documents, Sousley alleges Rector, who is also married, turned on him when he wouldn’t have sex and that she threatened to ‘destroy’ him.

Infatuation: Pastor Jerry Sousley of the Camdenton Bible Baptist Church in Missouri first alerted police to Rector, but for stalking and threatening him

Married: Clara, left, is married to Jason Rector, right. Jason was also implicated for allegedly helping his wife hide evidence of her stalking when he disposed of a notebook Clara used to document her sexual fantasies of Sousley

Fearing for his safety and that of his family, Sousley turned to police and Rector was arrested.

But while questioning her in the matter, Rector shocked cops by admitting to the murder of Tommy Hope.

Hope was found dead in his home in April 2004. Rector was questioned in the case but neither she nor anyone else was ever charged and the file had become a cold case.

Rector told police she’d had an affair with Hope and that she’d gone to his house that day to buy drugs.

When he told her he didn’t have any, she 
said she freaked out and with a butcher knife in hand ‘jumped on his 
back and cut his throat.’

Shock: No one, including Camden County Sheriff Dwight Franklin saw the admission coming, though Rector had been questioned in the crime

‘I was high,’ she told them, ‘and not thinking.’

Before her spontaneous admission, Rector documented her previous highs and lows on a blog called PrayReadLive.

Identifying herself as ‘CJ,’ Rector describes her sad and drug addled past.

However, she writes, ‘NOTHING, was able to fill the God-shaped hole in my heart.’

Despite her professed salvation, Rector is now charged with first degree murder, armed criminal action, and aggravated stalking.

She is joined by husband Jason Rector, who police say aided his wife by disposing of her sexual fantasy notebook at the Hillbilly Fairgrounds in Laurie, Missouri.

Mrs. Spector was denied a bond request. She is expected back in court May 28.
