After winning a two-hour battle with their biggest catch yet – the two fishermen released a 100kg grouper back in to the sea at Hervey Bay in Queensland.

The exciting scene attracted a crowd of 100 spectators as fishermen Chad Runnalls and Dylan Brooking hauled in a massive fish which finished up 1km from where the struggle began at the Urangan Pier on Sunday.

But a sign of respect for the sea animal the two men spent five minutes removing four old hooks from its body before setting it free which was met with a loud cheer from the group of impressed onlookers.

At least 100 people watched on as Chad Runnalls (left with rod) and Dylan Brooking (far right) took on the mammoth fish which they finally caught 1km away from where they hooked the grouper

Mr Runnalls said he and Mr Brooking mostly aimed to catch big mackerel and tuna when they went fishing most days.

’It's a phenomenal fish - it's a big beautiful girl of a fish,’ he told the Warwick Daily News. ‘They are living legends those fish and you would never in a million years do anything (to harm them).’

‘We patted her a bit and had a little bit of a moment with the fish, said go on old girl and she took off back into the water, no problem,’ he said.

Mr Runnalls said it was a good lesson for children to observe the moment

‘There's maybe about 10 local kids there most of the time and they were all there and they all got a chance to touch it, have photos with it - it was a really "bringing people together" moment,’ he said.

‘I spoke to an 80-year-old that's lived her all her life and she said it was the nicest thing she had ever seen.’

The groper was caught using a Tiagra 50-wide rod and reel and half a catfish for bait.

It took them five minutes to remove the four old hooks from its body before releasing it back into the water
