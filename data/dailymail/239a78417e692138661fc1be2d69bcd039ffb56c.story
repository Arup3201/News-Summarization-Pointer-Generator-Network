NFL star: Eli Manning arrives for his appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman last night in New York after leading the Giants to Super Bowl victory

Super Bowl hero Eli Manning told the David Letterman show last night he was dedicating the Giants' championship to his team-mates.

The two-time MVP made an appearance on the 'Late Show with David Letterman' just 24 hours after leading the New York Giants to a 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots for their second title in five years.

He was given a standing ovation as he emerged into the Ed Sullivan Theater to the sound of Queen's 'We Are The Champions'.

The quarterback had been in Disney World Florida for a victory parade only four hours before the interview as his team-mates landed triumphantly at Newark airport in the afternoon.

Manning told Letterman: 'When you win a championship, it's a team. It's a team coming together, and that's exactly what we did, and so I was happy for a lot of the guys.

'This is their first Super Bowl, so I think when you have one, that second one, you really do it for the other guys who've never had that experience.

'The first one just is wild.'

Big Blue's narrow win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI is their second over the same opponents in the last five years.

Eli Manning now has two Super Bowl MVP awards to go with this winner's rings - one more than his brother Peyton, quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts.

But the quarterback was coy on whether his older brother would return to action in the NFL next season.

Peyton Manning missed this entire season with a neck injury.

He said: 'He got a good report from his doctor, said "hey, you know, if you were my own son, I'd give you the ok to play", and so he'll be ready.

'He's healthy, now it's just about getting to 100 per cent where he can physically make all the throws.'

Appearance: Manning was given a standing ovation by the New York audience

The Giants won their fourth Super Bowl after coming from behind to win it in the final quarter.

Ahmad Bradshaw scored the winning touchdown, inadvertently, with less than a minute to go. The running back had intended to stop on the one yard line, but as the Patriots backed off to let him score, his forward momentum saw him fall over the line.

It was a different story for defeated 
quarterback Tom Brady, with usually dependable receiver Wes Welker 
dropping a pass late in the game that could have won it for the 
Patriots.

While the team refrained from pointing fingers for their loss, it wasn't the same for Brady's wife - supermodel Gisele Bundchen.

She was caught on camera swearing and complaining that dropped catches had doomed the team to defeat.

TheInsider.com quoted her as saying: 'My husband cannot f****** throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time.'

Up to a million fans are expected to line the streets of New York today for a ticker-tape parade through Wall Street district.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg will also 
present the team with the keys to the city. He said the parade would 
generate up to $38million for the city and that 50,000 people had 
entered a lottery for 500 tickets to the City Hall ceremony.

A third of those taking part in the victory parade, which goes from Battery Park to City Hall, will be from outside the city.
