Carer: Tanya Vasileva looked after her friend Gertrude Stanley before she died in 2009

The carer of a Holocaust survivor has won her right to an inheritance following a court battle against a TV 'heir hunter' who claimed she was a 'trespasser'. 

Tanya Vasileva looked after her friend Gertrude Stanley who had made London her home after fleeing Vienna just before the start of the Second World War.

Mrs Stanley died aged 89 believing she had no living relatives. 

Her sister had died in a concentration camp.

Mrs Stanley promised to leave her Hampstead flat to Miss Vasileva in return for the years of care she had selflessly given her.

However, she made no will and a legal wrangle ensued after professional genealogist, Peter Birchwood - who has appeared on the BBC series, Heir Hunters - traced two distant cousins of Mrs Stanley.

During a hearing in London, the court heard Mrs Stanley had experienced the horror of fleeing from Vienna and arrived in London in May 1939, when she was just 19. 

She and her husband, Lawrence, lived together in their flat, in Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, north London, for 48 years, until his death in 1994.

The couple never had any children and her sister, who also tried to escape Vienna but was captured, was dead. Mrs Stanley believed she had no blood relatives left alive.

The court heard that despite her sizeable fortune, most of which was discovered in bank accounts and shares following her death, the widow lived a humble existence and often worried she would run out of money.

She was also a hoarder and her obsession with keeping everything meant she still had the suitcases her sister had packed for her escape bid as well as her husband’s wartime army uniform.

Miss Vasileva cared part-time for the widow since 2005 while also holding down two jobs and moved into her flat. Mrs Stanley died in December 2009. 

Acting on behalf of Mrs Stanley’s estate, Mr Birchwood argued Miss Vasileva was a ‘trespasser’ who should be ousted from the property and made to pay £50,000 for her years of rent-free occupation.

However, a judge ruled Mrs Stanley did promise the flat to her carer and said Miss Vasileva had ‘done her best’ to look after the widow in her final years.

Judge Mark Raeside QC awarded Miss Vasileva £20,000 from the estate and dismissed Mr Birchwood’s financial claim against her.

But the judge also ruled that the ‘value’ of the free care provided by Miss Vasileva was only £70,000 - not the £160,000 value of the flat - and said she would have to leave her home in December so it could go back to the estate.

Speaking after the case Miss Vasileva said: 'I looked after her but we weren’t just friends, we were more like grandmother and granddaughter, we were very close.

'She was an extremely intelligent woman and I have some lovely memories of our time together. She will always be in my heart.'

The court heard that Mrs Stanley met Miss Vasileva who had moved to the UK from Bulgaria in 2002 at her local supermarket where the younger woman worked.

The 39-year-old described the touching friendship they struck up after she began helping the pensioner by delivering her shopping.

The two would regularly go to a hotel near her flat where the pensioner - a classically-trained pianist - would entertain guests by playing.

Miss Vasileva said: 'Gertrude loved music and she was an incredible pianist, she played by ear. She could play anything, things she heard on the radio, and she loved to play. 

'She had arthritis in her hands and she struggled with them, but when she played it was like she forgot all of her pain.'

However, she also suffered from anxiety and had an ‘obsessive’ personality, which led to her hoarding vast amounts of clutter, leaving her home in a squalid state.

Miss Vasileva, who has a masters degree in computing, helped her to clear the flat and would also take her to hospital and doctors’ appointments.

The court heard that in May 2005, following a two-month stay in hospital, Mrs Stanley phoned Miss Vasileva and asked if she could come and collect her from hospital because she had no-one else.

The widow was adamant she did not want any professional carers and asked her young friend if she would help her so she could stay in her own flat.

Miss Vasileva told the court: 'She said she was capable of doing things herself and she knew what she wanted - she was very strong-minded.'

According to Miss Vasileva, it was at this time that Mrs Stanley first said she wanted her to have the flat when she died. 

She said Mrs Stanley repeated the promise may more times. Her barrister, Gavin Hamilton, said: 'Miss Vasileva was the only person she knew who was young, female and willing to care for her.'

He said while she continued working at the supermarket and had a cleaning job, she also provided daily care to Mrs Stanley from then onwards - with the level of care increasing as the pensioner’s health deteriorated.

Miss Vasileva would cook and clean for her, bathe her, change her bedding and get her out of bed on a morning - which she could not do on her own - and continued to do so until Mrs Stanley went into a care home in April 2009.

Arguing that the pensioner’s promise to her should be honoured, Miss Vasileva told the court: 'The fact is she wanted to leave me the flat - what else should I have considered; that was her wish.

'There was a high level of trust in the relationship we had and she was a person who honoured her word, she never lied to me.

'She said I should not worry about it, everything is going to be arranged for.'

 'I am, in all the circumstances, satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to Miss Vasileva on the day on which she was discharged from hospital'

Judge Raeside

Mr Birchwood denied she was entitled to the flat and argued she should have to pay rent for the time she had lived there.

Ruling in Miss Vasileva’s favour, Judge Raeside found Mrs Stanley did promise her the flat, but said the £160,000 property was ‘disproportionate’ for the part-time care she had provided.

He concluded that, based on the level of care and the length of time it was given, she was entitled to £70,000.

The judge said the time she had already spent living in the flat was worth about £50,000 and therefore the estate should pay the other £20,000.

He also awarded Miss Vasileva all of her legal costs out of the estate.

The judge said: 'I am, in all the circumstances, satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to Miss Vasileva on the day on which she was discharged from hospital.

'I am also satisfied there is a sufficient nexus between the promise made by the deceased and the activities carried out by Miss Vasileva thereafter.'

Giving her six months before she has to leave the flat, he added: 'I am not going to force this lady out of this flat, this has been her home for some time and this is what the deceased asked should happen.

'I have decided that she should get a sum of money instead of two more years in the property, but to force her out of her home under pressure strikes me as quite wrong - this is her home.'
