A schoolboy is raising eyebrows each morning by cycling through busy streets on a unicycle. 

Cameron Peacock makes the three-and-a-half mile round trip to his school every day on just one wheel.

And despite using this unusual method of transport for the past two years, he still gets passers-by shouting at him: 'Think you've lost a wheel, mate.'

Daredevil: Cameron Peacock, 14, travels more than ten miles a week getting to lessons on his unicycle

The 14-year-old schoolboy, who lives in Roseworth, Stockton-on-Tees, says he likes to be different, and considers the strange looks he gets as he travels to his lessons every morning as part of the fun.

He said: 'I still get sarcastic comments from some people, who shout 'You've lost half your bike' or 'Give us a wheelie'.

'Lots of car drivers beep their horns when they see me, and most make a joke, but if it is an old person they tend to shout a bit.'

Cameron says he is used to motorists shouting at him as he cycles to school

Cameron, a pupil at Bishopsgarth School in Stockton-on-Tees, learnt his unusual skill at JUST (Juggling Unicycling Stockton-on-Tees), and says he likes to be different.

He said: 'I like to be unique and it keeps me fit and healthy.

'Obviously, riding a unicycle is more tricky than riding a conventional bike but it is not as difficult as people think: everyone can do it if they put their mind to it.

'It took me about two-and-a-half hours of practice before I was able to cycle five metres, and a week of practice before I could cycle constantly.

'I love doing trialling on my unicycles, which means I do tricks like jumping on ramps.

'I don't know exactly what I want to do in the future, but at the moment I would like to be the best I possibly can be at unicycling. I want to be number one in the UK.'

Cameron has eight unicycles and spends his free time doing stunts on them, as well as taking them on cross-country tracks.

His mother, Claire Peacock, 42, is used to her son's preferred mode of transport, but says she worries about the reactions of others.

She said: 'I'm surprised he hasn't ever caused a crash, as motorists stare at him open-mouthed.

'I was quite worried when Cameron first started riding his unicycle to school, but I worry less now, and am just very proud of him.

'He had more accidents on his normal bike than he's ever had on his unicycle, and he is in complete control of it.'

Off to school: Cameron Peacock has been going to lessons on his unicycle for two years

Mrs Peacock said Cameron was never into football like other boys, and got into unicycling at 11.  He now spends all his pocket money on unicycles, and is the sixth best trial rider in the country.

Later this year Cameron, who lives with his mother, father Jeffrey, 46, a self-employed haulage contractor, and brother Matthew, 18, will be taking part in various competitions at the British Juggling Convention, and he hopes to be named the best trial unicyclist in the country.

Bishopsgarth School headteacher Sue Cain said: 'Cameron has shared his skills and talents with his year group in assemblies, and we have all been wowed by his expertise in using the unicycle.

'We strive to see all of our students develop a wide range of skills and knowledge both in and out of the classroom, and Cameron has shown that we can all be the best we can be in our chosen field.'
