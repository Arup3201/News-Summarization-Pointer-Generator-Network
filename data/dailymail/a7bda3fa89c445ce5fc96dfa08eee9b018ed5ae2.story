Nearly every team which reached the last eight of this remarkable World Cup had nervous moments. But none came as close to elimination as Holland.

Only five minutes remained in the Fortaleza oven against Mexico last weekend when Wesley Sneijder’s right foot kicked new life into the Dutch challenge and ripped a hole in the hearts of the Central Americans.

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s penalty a few minutes later completed the Dutch revival but that afternoon led to some introspection within Louis van Gaal’s squad. So we may see a slightly different approach to Saturday’s meeting with Costa Rica.

Arjen Robben reflected: ‘I thought during the first half we weren’t good when Mexico had possession and that will have to improve against Costa Rica.

‘In general, I think we were stronger when we had the ball, so that’s a plus. We have to do that more. We let Mexico play a bit too much. In the second half I was on the ball more and I could threaten the opposition going forward. That’s a much nicer feeling.’ 

Van Gaal’s approach to this tournament has been interesting. Recognising, perhaps, that his squad is not blessed with quality throughout, the incoming Manchester United manager has set Holland up to soak up pressure and use the pace of Robben and the intelligence of Wesley Sneijder and Manchester United's Robin van Persie on the counter-attack.

At times it has worked spectacularly, as it did in their opening demolition of Spain. At others - against Australia and then Mexico - it has almost been their undoing.

At home, question marks are asked constantly of Van Gaal’s approach and it says much for his players’ faith in him that they adhere slavishly to his instructions.

It would appear, though, that Holland are preparing to be more proactive at Arena Fonte Nova on Saturday.

‘Of course in Holland we’re used to playing 4-3-3; attacking football with two wingers,’ agreed Robben. ‘But I think you also have to look at the quality of the squad. That’s what we did and what the manager did.

‘We spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system. I think it’s very functional, maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing, but still very good.

‘And we’ve played four games and scored 12 goals, so that’s pretty positive.

‘I think we are on a mission together and when you come to a World Cup it’s not to enjoy the weather and enjoy the beach in Rio. You’re here to win matches and to go as far as possible.

‘I don’t think the expectations were that high before the tournament and as a result we can be very proud of where we are.’

Certainly there is a sense of purpose among the Dutch that has not always been apparent in previous tournaments. They do, though, occasionally look as if they are a step away from implosion.Costa Rica will have precious little fear on Saturday.

They have already shown the ability to take down superior opposition and victories against Uruguay and Italy were as deserved as they were unexpected.

The Dutch will suffer from the absence of the injured Nigel de Jong and it will be interesting to see how they line up. Against Mexico, the Dutch back three looked uncomfortable at times without the former Manchester City midfielder to shield them.

With Robben in the team and in such prime form, however, Holland will continue to be dangerous. Few in Holland can remember seeing him play better.

‘I just feel very strong,’ he said. ‘I feel good, I feel fit and I think that’s the most important thing because I can transfer everything onto the pitch. I’m having a lot of fun and really enjoying it here. Mentally, I feel really good and, physically, I feel very strong. 

‘I can play my football and I’m really happy that I can help the team. I think we (the senior players) also have the responsibility for the younger guys.

‘We try to take them along and I think we’ve got a good mixture of experience and youth at the moment. Again, everything we do, we do together and it was beautiful to turn the Mexico game around as a team.’
