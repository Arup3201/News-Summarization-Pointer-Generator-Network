Richard Kilty dressed up as Superman to power into the 60 metres semi-finals at the European Indoor Championships in Prague - and then set his sights on winning a domestic duel for gold with Great Britain team-mate Chijindu Ujah on Sunday.

Kilty, the surprise world indoor champion 12 months ago, and Ujah were the fastest two qualifiers from Saturday's heats at the O2 Arena, both clocking 6.57 seconds and looking easy doing so.

The 25-year-old was clad in an all-in-one bodysuit for the race and said: 'It's Superman this look. I told my little niece I would dress up for her as Superman in the heats.'

Kilty had a quick spar with the event mascot, a mole called Krtek, after the race, but will have Ujah firmly in his sights on Sunday.

The 21-year-old also wears a bodysuit to race in which has helped him earn the nickname Spiderman.

'Superman can beat Spiderman, so it'll be a great battle tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it,' said Kilty.

Ujah went into the championships as the fastest man in the field, having run 6.53secs this year, but Kilty said he had plenty more to give.

'I wanted to remind people a little bit, but I thought that would be 6.60s with the effort I put into it,' he said.

'I've come here in great shape. There are still a few technical things - when I looked at the replay I wasn't quite standing low enough in the blocks - but there are massive improvements to come as long as I keep enjoying myself and keep the same mentality.

'I think I've got something to prove coming out here.'

Sean Safo-Antwi was the third Briton to reach the semi-final stage of the event

The third Briton in the field, Sean Safo-Antwi, also booked his place in the semi-finals, clocking 6.67.

Less than 24 hours after finishing an essay assessing American historian Natalie Zemon Davis' 1983 book 'The Return of Martin Guerre', Dina Asher-Smith showed she was in the form to break the British 60m record by storming into the semi-finals in the women's event.

The 19-year-old history student clocked 7.10, a personal best, to win her heat with ease.

That she eased down well before the line indicated Jeanette Kwakye's mark of 7.08 would be under serious threat in the semi-finals and final on Sunday.

Asher-Smith was the joint second fastest qualifier, with Dutch gold medal favourite Dafne Schippers leading the way with 7.07.

Germany's Verena Sailor also clocked 7.10 and the medals look set to be shared among the trio.

'It was a heat so I did try and control it so I could get into the semi-finals, but at the same time I'm really shocked by the time,' Asher-Smith said. 'I'm over the moon. I really wasn't expecting to run so quickly.

'Dafne was amazing and I saw Verena as well so I knew the track was quick. Obviously it wasn't going to change my race, but I did have that at the back of my mind that maybe if I put in a bit less effort I could still get a quick time.

'Hopefully I've got lots to improve on and there's more to come in the semis.'

Kwakye is ready for the record to go, tweeting: 'Someone in Prague please tell @dinaashersmith that my British 60m record is gift wrapped and ready to give to her! Aftercare advice inc!' p'::

Rachel Johncock also went through in 7.26.
