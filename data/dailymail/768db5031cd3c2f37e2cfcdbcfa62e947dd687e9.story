Bolton manager Neil Lennon has revealed that new Manchester United signing Andy Kellett refused to believe him when he told him he was going on loan to Old Trafford.

United produced perhaps the shock of a generally unremarkable transfer deadline day on Monday when they plucked Kellett from Bolton's reserves at 10.55pm on a deal until the end of the season.

It is understood that United will use the 21-year-old – who only has four first-team appearances for Bolton – in their Under 21 squad after allowing Belgian Marnick Vermijl to move to Sheffield Wednesday earlier in the day.

Kellett spent time on loan at Plymouth Argyle earlier this season

But Lennon revealed the morning after that he will always remember the reaction of the youngster when he was called in to be told the news on Monday night.

'He thought he was going to Plymouth but we told him he was going to United,' said Lennon.

'He didn't believe us. He was like: "No way".

'He rang his dad and I think his dad had to have a sit down.

'His mate came in with him at the same time and he was actually wearing a Man United track suit.

'But it's an opportunity of a life time for him.

Bolton manager Neil Lennon described the move as an opportunity of a lifetime for Kellett

'I have known [United reserve coach] Warren Joyce has liked Andy for a while.

'We have been looking for pace in the team so [chairman] Phil Gartside got on the phone to United and asked if we could take Saidy Janko and they said we could if they could take Andy.

'It's a good move for us and a fantastic opportunity for Andy.'

Kellett's last game for Bolton was in the 4-2 defeat at Rotherham that followed the club's goalless draw at Liverpool in the FA Cup. The defender was taken off after 50 minutes with the score at 3-0.

'We used Andy the other week at Rotherham, and it was a difficult game to come into after Liverpool and didn't play as well as we had hoped,' added Lennon.

As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way

'But he has been in the first-team squad since he came back from Plymouth [where he had been on loan] and they were very keen to take him back again.

'But then this came up.'

Bolton face Liverpool in the FA Cup replay at their own Macron Stadium on Tuesday night after a transfer deadline day that saw them complete a number of deals.

'It was a good day for us,' added Lennon. 'It was good to get home at midnight and have a lie down.'

Who?

Exactly. When Jim White reported the signing on Sky Sports News' Deadline Day coverage, Twitter went into meltdown. Surely this was some mistake? This was not a Mats Hummels or a Marco Reus. Across the country, bemused United fans rewound their TVs and wnt straight to Google. Sure enough, abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from United's official account to their 4.35m followers. The club had brought in Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season with Under 21 right back Saidy Janko going the other way.

But why?

It's a good question. Some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan. But there is method in the madness. United are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men's football. They want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the Under 21 league. Officials will hope Janko's footballing education will be furthered in the Championship. Departures like this, however, leave their own Under 21 side short of numbers. Manager Warren Joyce is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues. He is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not. This would appear to be the case with Kellett.

So what's his pedigree?

He's Bolton-born , 21 and a left back. A product of the club's academy he has made four first-team appearances and earned a loan move to Plymouth Argyle in October. While at the League Two Devon side he scored a wonder goal at Northampton Town and was described as a solid performer by fans.

How did the move come about?

United had to fight off interest from Plymouth (not a sentence you often write) to bring him to Old Trafford. The Bolton News spoke to first-team coach Garry Parker who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster.

'Sit down,' he said, before adding that they had some 'good news and bad news'. Kellett opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to Home Park.

Presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was.

'You're going to Manchester United,' was the response.

What can we expect?

In an interview with fans site Vital Bolton, Kellett says he models himself on Jordi Alba and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing. Former Wanderers boss Dougie Freedman was impressed and made him the first Bolton-born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the Scot described as off-the-field attitude issues. Joyce has seen him in action and is impressed, and with Louis van Gaal's history of giving youth a chance, who knows what will happen next?
