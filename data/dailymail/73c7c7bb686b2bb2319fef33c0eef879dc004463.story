The last remnants of Baroness Thatcher’s life have been wrapped in brown paper and removed from the house in which she lived for the final 22 years of her life.

Removal men packed paintings, desk, chairs and other furniture into a van on Monday outside the former prime minister’s four-storey former home in Belgravia, central London.

The property has not been sold since the death of Lady Thatcher aged 87 at the Ritz hotel in April and it is believed that her belongings were being put into storage.

On the move: The removal comes one month after it was revealed Lady Thatcher's funeral cost £1.2million

Last month it was revealed that her funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral cost £1.2million - just two pence for every person in Britain - far less than the figure of £10million originally suggested by critics.

More than 2,300 mourners were at the ceremony. The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former prime minister for the first time since Winston Churchill.

She was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the 'courage and perseverance' of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

Surrounded by the people who cared for her, the Iron Lady died 'peacefully' in her Ritz suite following a stroke, as she sat up and quietly read.

Lady Thatcher, who had suffered a series 
of mini-strokes over the past decade, recognised the symptoms as she 
fell ill in the luxurious room, 'but this was the one that killed her', a
friend said.

The suite, which would cost up to £3,660 a night, boasts 24 carat gold leaf and antique Louis XVI furnishings. Her body was removed by private ambulance almost 13 hours after her death.

She was sighted on a park bench in London enjoying the sunshine in March last year with her carer Kate. Gone were her high heels, replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking stick.

Then, at Christmas, she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question.

So she moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz - one of her favourite places - and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future. She never left.
