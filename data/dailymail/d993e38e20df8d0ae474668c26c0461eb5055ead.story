Risk: James McCormick made £50million and put thousands of lives at risk by selling fake bomb detectors

A conman who put thousand of lives at risks by selling fake bomb detectors was given advice on how to market the devices to United Nations agencies by British Government officials, it has emerged.

James McCormick made £50million by selling the plastic objects based on £13 novelty 'golf ball finders' to security forces - particularly in Iraq, where they were used at virtually every checkpoint in 
Baghdad and Basra from 2006 and are still in use today.

The 57-year-old touted the ‘completely ineffectual’ gadgets for up to £27,000 each to police forces and armies around the world.

And it has now been revealed that he attended a seminar on 'how to sell to the UN' organised by UK Trade & Investment in March 2008, where he met with officials responsible for promoting British business abroad.

Although there is no evidence that staff at the seminar knew the devices were useless, the Department for Business was warned about the dangers of fake detectors in 2008.

A whistleblower sent a dossier entitled 'Dowsing rods endanger lives' to business minister Ian Pearson in November that year, saying: 'Somebody is going to be seriously hurt or killed using or relying on these devices to detect explosives, if they haven't already.'

The gadgets are essentially just hand-held aerials fixed to plastic hinges.

But,
 incredibly, McCormick persuaded governments and military chiefs that 
they could detect tiny traces of explosives, drugs, ivory and even 
humans at a distance of up to three miles.

Yesterday the ‘morally bankrupt’ businessman was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey.

Senior British and Iraqi security officials believe his scam allowed suicide bombers to kill and maim thousands.

On
 one occasion terrorists drove a vehicle laden with rockets and missiles
 through 23 checkpoints in Baghdad where the device was used.

McCormick, a former trainee policeman, used the millions he was paid to fund a lavish lifestyle.

He owned a £5million Regency townhouse
 in Bath, a £1.5million farmhouse near Taunton, Somerset, a £250,000 
holiday home in Florida and a £350,000 villa in Cyprus.

The conman also spent £630,000 on a 
Sunseeker yacht and £210,000 on three horses for one of his two 
daughters who wants to compete in the British dressage team at the 2016 
Olympics.

Although police have frozen £15million
 of his assets, investigators believe he has laundered at least another 
£15million through Cyprus, Belize and Beirut.

The Iraqi government spent £56million on the fake bomb detectors, some of which was paid as bribes to senior figures.

These
 included General Jihad al-Jabiri, head of the Baghdad bomb squad, who 
helped McCormick win the massive contract.

He and two other Iraqi 
officials are now serving jail terms for corruption.

McCormick
 based the fake detector on a novelty golf ball finder called a 
Golfinder.

He imported large shipments of them from the US from 2005.

He claimed they worked by using 
electrostatic energy from the human body, coming to life after the user 
has shuffled their feet or walked a few steps. Users were given a 
variety of cards supposedly programmed to detect different substances.

At first he simply attached stickers 
bearing the words ‘International Association of Bomb Technicians’ to the
 golf ball finders to make them look authentic.

Glossy brochures marketing the devices promised that they could pick up substances up to 100ft underwater or 30ft underground.

The conman said they could also detect fluids and human beings.

Later versions of the device were modified slightly, but still closely resembled the golf ball finders.

McCormick reeled in clients by 
embarking on a series of sales talks in which he purported to explain 
the science behind his system.

He even claimed to have a doctorate – despite leaving school in Liverpool with just three O-levels.

During the trial, Professor David 
Last, from the University of Wales, said: ‘To me it was a jumble of 
technical phrases and disconnected sentences. In my judgment it had no 
scientific validity whatsoever.’

As well as Iraq and Afghanistan, the detectors were sold to Niger, Georgia, Romania, Thailand and Saudi Arabia.

Attempts were made to supply them to United Nations security forces in Lebanon, but the deal was never done.

Prosecutor Richard Whittam, QC, said 
the devices did not work ‘in accordance with the known laws of physics’.
 They were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’ 
and were no better at identifying bombs then trying to detect them by 
random chance.

‘The devices did not work and 
McCormick knew they did not work. But he had manufactured them so they 
could be sold despite the fact they did not work.’

When police raided McCormick’s 
properties in July 2010 they found invoices for hundreds of golf ball 
finders. A leaflet about the Golfinders discovered at his home said: 
‘It’s a great novelty item that you should have fun with.’

After the trial Detective 
Superintendent Nigel Rock, of Avon and Somerset police, said: ‘I find 
what he did quite incredible and diabolical.

‘He knew what he was doing – he was 
selling something that was useless. His device doesn’t work and can 
never work and McCormick knows that.’ McCormick will be sentenced on May
 2.
