Georgia May Jagger is well known for her distinctive looks and on-camera presence so it comes as no surprise to see her posing on a throne for her latest campaign.

Sunglass Hut have enlisted the 22-year-old as their brand ambassador for autumn, featuring her as the star of their new advertisements 'Modern Royalty.'

The campaign aims to spotlight designers and premium shades as a modern interpretation of the crown, the ultimate power accessory.

Despite the fact that many of us have packed our sunglasses away for the autumn the brand insists they are still required for those moments of winter sun and says that they 'complete a September wardrobe.'

The glossy images were shot in Los Angeles guaranteeing a healthy dose of sun to complement the campaign. 

The tagline that accompanies the image is 'Make it Reign', an ironic slogan maybe for an accessory that tries to avoid the rain, but Georgia says that she was fond of the theme and the twist that the brand had put on the classic notion of the crown. 

'I think it's a fun idea to make sunglasses the modern day crown. It's taking everything we know about good old-fashioned royalty and spinning it on its head.'

Georgia posed alongside 22-year-old Brazilian model Marlon Teixeira.

Georgia's shoot took place in a garden in Los Angeles surrounded by topiary 

Queen Georgia is not alone in the pictures, posing alongside 22-year-old Brazilian model Marlon Teixeira. The pair are see sitting for their royal portrait in an embellished throne set against a garden filled with whimsical topiary.

The concept is built around the idea that anyone can be a king or queen these days by adding opulence through what they wear, including majestic-looking eyewear.. 

A spokesman for Luxottica, the company behind Sunglass Hut, says that sunglasses are as much a part of the modern day wardrobe as footwear: 'Sunglasses are like shoes, it's a guilty pleasure accessory that you can never have too many of.'
