She is the perfect person to ask to come and sing at a New Year party due to her love of all things festive.

So it’s no surprise that Mariah Carey was invited to come and end the year on a high note at a party which was believed to be hosted by one of the Sultan of Brunei’s sons on Tuesday evening.

Her performance has however raised eyebrows as it comes just a couple of weeks after she came under fire for being paid $1 million to perform for Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos.

Diva: Mariah wore a glamorous white gown emblazoned with rhinestones, and a pair of long white gloves

In early December her decision to put on a two hour show for the dictator angered human rights groups who allege Dos Santos has murdered many and exploited the country's resources to his own gain.

That concert came five years after Mariah apologized after performing for notorious dictator Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was toppled and killed during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. A spokesperson for Mariah has been contacted about her decision.

But joined by her husband Nick Cannon and gorgeous twins Monroe and Morocco, the 43-year-old pulled out all the stops wearing a low-cut silver frock at the lavish event held at the Dorchester Hotel, unconcerned about ruffling any feathers.

And it seems the look went down particularly well with 33-year-old Nick who was well and truly sprung when he was captured on film looking captivated by Mariah's more than ample assets as the couple waited to ring in the new year.

The singer shared the picture on Instagram captioning it: 'Happy New Year!!!! "You like this and you know it.'''

The dress was embellished with silver studs and making it even more Hollywood glam, the Hero singer added a pair of long sparkly opera gloves.

Making sure to draw even more attention to her ample bosom, the star wore a stunning diamond necklace that came to a point at the end just at the top of her cleavage.

Mariah was able to get away from her husband long enough to enjoy a hug from the other special man in her life - son Moroccan.

The two-year-old, who was dressed up in an adorable - and very dapper - tux, gave his mother a big kiss.

While the little boy dressed like his father, Mariah's daughter showed she too had a passion for glam fashion like her mother

Monroe also wore an all white ensemble featuring a glittery dress with pink bow and a white fur jacket.

The well-dressed family looked right at home amongst the impressive guestlist which included the likes of Jerry Hall, Bianca Jagger and A-list actor John Travolta.

Brrrr! The four were bundled up substantially as they braved the cold

Amid free-flowing champagne and specially-sourced foods the guest mingled before being entertained by Mariah and Diana Ross who capped the evening with a live show on either side on the midnight countdown.

Mariah, who performed a number of tracks as part of her headline set which was described as 'rousing', was preceded by former Supremes star Diana Ross, who performed a rendition if I Will Survive.

Following the extravagant bash Mariah emerged on Wednesday evening alongside husband Nick, daughter Monroe, and record producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri.

The four were bundled up substantially as they braved the cold.  Mariah
 was very fashionable and colour-coordinated in a light brown knit 
sweater, dark brown knit scarf, brown suede high-heeled boots, and brown
 leggings.

Nick was of course much more casual in a bright orange snow jacket, a gray hoodie
 with the hood up, gray sweatpants, and black sneakers as he smiled at the camera.

Mariah
 carried two-year-old Monroe in her arms and appeared to have styled her
 little girl with care - pinning white flower ribbons in her hair and 
dressing her in a chic little coat and brown boots. 

Prior
 to London, Mariah enjoyed an extended stay in Aspen, Colorado with 
Nick, Monroe, and Monroe's fraternal twin brother, Moroccan.
