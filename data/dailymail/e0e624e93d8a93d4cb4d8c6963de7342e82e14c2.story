The mother and brother of the man nickname the 'Maimi Cannibal' said he would 'never' be capable of attacking another person and chewing his face off.

Ruth Charles does not believe police accounts that her son Rudy Eugene assaulted Ronald Poppo and tore 70 percent of his face off with his teeth -- despite watching the horrifying surveillance video of the attack.

Poppo, a homeless 65-year-old, survived the attack with little left of his face 'but a goatee.' Plastic surgery experts warn doctors will have to remove even more tissue before they can begin the lengthy, arduous process of rebuilding his face.

'NEVER': Ruth Charles, Eugene's mother, refused to show her face on camera, but said her son is the victim in the cannibalism case

Ronald Poppo's daughter was shocked to learn it was her father the Miami cannibal had attacked.

Janice Poppo DiBello told the NY Daily News that she was abandoned by her dad as a child.

'I’m really upset because I haven’t met my father,' the 44-year-old said.

'Since I was 2 years old, him and my 
mum got divorced and there was no - like how normal divorces are, where 
you see your father,' she said.

'Nobody ever heard anything 
from him, so I’ve never met him.

'I didn’t know if he was alive or dead.'

Poppo DiBello doesn't know whether she will travel from her home in New Jersey to Florida to visit her father in hospital.

'I’m still in shock about everything,' she said.

'It was a complete shock, because 
like I said, I’ve never had a relationship with my biological father. I have never heard from him. I have no idea what 
happened to him.

'Nothing ever came up, so I thought he was dead,' she said.

'I knew my son. Rudy will never, never do something like that,' Ms Charles told WPLG.

'He was a good kid. He gave me a nice
 card on Mother’s Day. Everyone says he was a zombie. He was no zombie. 
That was my son,' she told WFOR.

She, along with Eugene's girlfriend 
and his brother have painted a radically different picture of the 
31-year-old than the naked man seen using his teeth to tear flesh from 
another man's face for 18 minutes.

Police say they were forced to shoot 
Eugene multiple times after he growled at them and refused to stop 
gnawing on Poppo's flesh.

Ms Charles said she thinks her son was drugged and dumped along the MacArthur Causeway near Miami Beach.

Confused and frightened in the 90-degree heat, Eugene only attacked Poppo after he felt threatened, Ms Charles claims.

Police have a different story: They 
believe he went into a rage-filled frenzy after snorting 'bath salts,' a
 new synthetic drug.

He walked several miles along the highway -- gradually stripping off his clothes -- after his car broke down, they say.

Plastic surgery experts told ABC News
 that Poppo, a New York City native who once went to a prestigious high 
school and was a member of the Latin club, is still in dangerous 
territory for his recovery.

They warned that human bite wounds often become infected and doctors must work now to ensure his injuries don't turn deadly.

Poppo is currently in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Once he is out of the danger zone, doctors will likely need to cut out even more of his face.

From there, doctors must begin evaluating how best to replace his eyes, nose and mouth, all of which were bitten off, along with the skin covering his face.

Dr Song said surgeons could take a 
'microsurgical flap' from his belly or his thigh and attach the skin and
 blood vessels to his face to reform new tissue -- which can take months
 or years to complete.

Dr Song said Poppo might be a candidate for facial transplant, as well, but he cautioned that option is more complicate than it might seem.

'Although the face transplant patients may look good the downside is they will have to be on expensive immune suppressive medications so that his body does not reject another person's face for the rest of his life,' he said.

'The cost can be hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Someone is going to have to give him medication. He would also have to have good social support, psychiatric support. It's a huge production.'
