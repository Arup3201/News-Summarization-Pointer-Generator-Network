This is the incredible moment that Oliver Frost shaved more than eight seconds off his own world record for solving a 4x4 Rubik's Cube whilst blindfolded.

The 21-year-old neuroscience student from the University of Westminster shortened his own best time for completing the conundrum to 2 minutes 10.47 seconds.

He smashed his previous record of 2 minutes 18.65 seconds to retain the title for a fourth time during a competition at the University of Edinburgh.

To tackle the riddle that has stumped avid-gamers for years, Oliver practices extensively to hone his memory skills.

'It always feels great to break a world record, especially if you've worked hard for it for as long as I have to develop my memory and methods,' he said.

The University of Westminster student used to practice his skills every night

'But ultimately the reason I compete is to meet up with some of my best friends, travel around the UK and even abroad and to keep my brain sharp.

'To get to my speed it did take quite a lot of practice.

'I used to practice for a few hours a day, until I got a bit older and started to focus on university and jobs.'

The challenge was one of several World Cube Association events contested by participants from 14 countries.

Oliver added: 'The techniques for memorizing something like a Rubik's Cube or even other things like packs of cards or numbers have stayed the same for thousands of years.

'Everyone is capable - it just requires a bit of patience.'

The Rubik's cube was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974.

He created the puzzle because he wanted a working model to help explain three-dimensional geometry. 

It won Toy of the Year in the UK in both 1980 and 1981, despite the fact most people could not solve the riddle. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband is a fan of the toy and once boasted that he can do a Rubik's cube in 90 seconds.
