Lone agent: WWII MI5 agent 'Jack King' is today unmasked as humble bank clerk Eric Roberts

A lone MI5 agent who neutralised hundreds of Nazis during the Second World War is today unmasked as a modest suburban bank clerk whose civilian bosses had considered him nothing ‘special’.

The ‘genius’ undercover operative managed to infiltrate and control Nazi sympathisers living in England – preventing them from passing intelligence to Berlin.

Information he prevented ever reaching Hitler’s henchmen included the need for a ‘renewed Blitz, with more bomb damage aimed at undermining public morale’.

Until today, the agent had been known only by his pseudonym, Jack King. But Security Service files reveal his real identity was Eric Arthur Roberts, a father-of-two from Epsom.

Born in 1907 and educated in Penzance, he spent 15 years working for Westminster Bank without managers noticing anything remarkable about his skills. Indeed, senior staff expressed surprise when the Security Service requested Roberts’ release in 1940.

Assistant controller RW Jones wrote: ‘What we would like to know here is – what are the particular and especial qualifications of Mr Roberts – which we have not been able to perceive?’

In fact, he had been identified by Maxwell Knight – MI5’s top agent runner – as a potentially huge asset. One MI5 officer described Roberts as ‘thoroughly familiar with everything connected with the various pro-Nazi organisations in this country’.

According to his personal record sheet, he had only a ‘slight’ knowledge of German, although he had twice visited the country on holidays in the 1930s. He had, however, somehow acquired a knowledge of the pro-Nazi groups operating in Britain in the period before the outbreak of the Second World War – although how he came to do so is not disclosed in the documents.

He was also a ju-jitsu enthusiast – having been a member of the Anglo Japanese Judo Club – which may have proved handy for a secret agent. Upon being liberated from the bank’s Euston Road branch in London, Roberts was deployed to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Hitler in some parts of England.

By posing as an undercover Gestapo officer, Roberts was able to control groups of ‘Fifth Columnists’ who were trying to aid the Fascist cause.

The Nazi sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to Berlin – but all the while the information was being handed straight to MI5. By the end of the war, Roberts had monitored and controlled the activities of hundreds of would-be traitors.

The Nazi sympathisers, based mainly in London and the south of England, used messages written in invisible ink and other ruses to pass details of Home Guard operations and intelligence on jet propulsion and radar systems. Had the network not been penetrated, it could have done significant harm, MI5 said.

The traitors were never prosecuted, to avoid blowing future operations, and went to their graves believing they had helped Hitler. The files contain numerous accounts of King’s meetings with Nazi sympathisers, including one from April 1943 with three women who were discussing a recent German air raid.

He wrote: ‘A nearby school clinic was hit and Nancy Brown said with a grin that one expectant mother was killed, two girls badly injured, a clerk and two children killed.

‘I looked in vain at the faces of these three women for signs of contrition. Nancy Brown looked a fine, healthy specimen of an Englishwoman, but it was obvious the deaths of these people meant absolutely nothing to her.’

Some of ‘Jack King’s’ exploits first came to light in February, when an initial batch of MI5 papers relating to his courage were declassified.

The files do not disclose what happened to Roberts after the war.
