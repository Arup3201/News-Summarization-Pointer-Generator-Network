Dapper in a navy suit, red and blue striped tie and a pair of polished dress shoes, the Duke of Cambridge was every inch the prince as he met well-wishers in Coventry today.

But there was one part of his ensemble that wasn't quite so princely - the turquoise and black loom band that peeped out from beneath his cuff.

He was given the bracelet while chatting to young well-wishers, and as he put it on, even revealed he already had a stash of 200 at home.

Loom band fan: Prince William greets crowds in Coventry while wearing his turquoise and purple loom band

Prince William isn't the only royal 
to succumb to the loom band craze. The Duchess of Cambridge is also a 
fan, after being given a red and pink band by a little girl during the 
tour of Australia and New Zealand in April, as is the Duchess of Cornwall.

Since the Duchess appeared in one, loom bands have become one of this summer's biggest trends, with sales rocketing by 300 per cent over the past three months - thanks in part to the Kate effect.

But it wasn't all loom bands, with William using his visit to the War Memorial Park in Coventry to call for more protection from councils for memorial parks.

On his 
first public engagement as president of the Fields in Trust (FiT) 
charity, the prince highlighted the charity's Centenary
 Fields programme which is run in partnership with the Royal British Legion.

William, who placed a wreath at the garden’s centrepiece memorial during 
his visit, said these green spaces should not be taken for granted, 
describing them as 'a vital part of our national heritage'.

Ahead of his visit to Coventry, the prince had also penned an op-ed run in local publications around the country, in which he spoke of his admiration for the deeds of the soldiers whose sacrifice the parks honour.

'World War One continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten,' he wrote.

'Each moment of play or use that takes place on a memorial field is, in a way, an act of remembrance.'

During his visit to the park, he also found time to speak to ex-paratroopers Lonnie Downes and Mick Murtagh who fought in Borneo in the 1960s.

Afterwards, William helped a class from the city's Howes Primary School to plant poppy seeds near the park's play area.

But it was the royal embrace of loom bands that left well-wishers agog - a trend also picked up by A-listers such as David Beckham and Harry Styles.

Also getting involved with the trend is the Middleton family which is selling the bands on their Party Pieces website.

The bands have also proved lucrative for their inventor, US father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng, who came up with the idea last year.

Since then, his company, Rainbow 
Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, 
crochet hook and bands – worldwide.

'The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon,' commented Anna Protherough, senior buyer for kids at Hobbycraft.

'We began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been flying off our shelves.

'The options for what you can create are endless and these kits really can keep children entertained for hours, perfect for the summer holidays.’

With yet another royal happy to show off his love 
for the plastic bracelets, it seems the loom band craze could well be here to 
stay. 

'World War One continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten.

One of the most obvious manifestations of remembrance which continue to touch us today is the countless war memorials up and down the country.

Most are typical: stone crosses or statues, surrounded by the names of the young men who never returned home. But some were more ambitious, and none more so than the plots of land which were set aside by communities as spaces of remembrance. 

These spaces were designed to encourage both stillness and movement, inward reflection and outward play. In short, places where freedom may be expressed with such ease.

This War Memorial Park in Coventry has to be one of the most extraordinary examples of this. The stunning war memorial, and the many other memorials around the park, are dotted between places where children play football and throw frisbees, families picnic together, or walk the dog.

It is a beautiful place – Coventry City Council and the people it serves have every right to be immensely proud of it.

The Centenary Fields project, which I am privileged to launch today, aims to save in perpetuity scores of memorial spaces around the country.  Most will not be as large as this, but every one is valued by its community.

Each moment of play or leisure that takes place on a Memorial Field is, in a way, an act of remembrance.

I am delighted that Fields in Trust have identified these Centenary Fields as a vital part of our national heritage and well-being, which we cannot take for granted. 

Working with The Royal British Legion, Fields in Trust will encourage and cajole Local Authorities all across the country to follow Coventry’s lead to safeguard Centenary Fields in their area. I have no doubt that they will succeed, but only if they have help.

I encourage Local Authorities to support this cause and to safeguard these living spaces of remembrance for generations to come.

Thank you.'
