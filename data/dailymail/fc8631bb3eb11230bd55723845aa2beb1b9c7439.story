Critics of Uber have attempted to crash the taxi app in any way they can, one of which is getting drivers to rate passengers just one star and thereby making the rating system meritless.

A Daily Dot journalist named Nimrod Kamer was fed up with Uber's privacy issues, their desire to dig up dirt on journalists, and their assault allegations.

Kamer decided to shake Uber's rating based system so that he could cause chaos for the popular app and fuel the anti Uber revolution.

Amused: When drivers heard journalist Nimrod Kamer's request for them to rate him one star they were very hesitant because they didn't one a low rating for themselves

Disbelieving: This Uber driver laughs in disbelief when Nimrod Kamer asks him for just one star 

The man with the plan: Journalist Nimrod Kamer believes that by asking for a one star rating he inspire others to take suit who will then overthrow Uber's rating based system 

Uber demands that both drivers and passengers rate each other anywhere between one and five stars with five being the best and one being the worst.

Kamer believes that if passengers ask drivers to rate those, just one star that it, 'will throw the drivers off-guard, mixing up the system, and sparking total anarchy.'

Kamer explains that since drivers need high scores to stay employed that they might be afraid to give a passenger one star in fear of getting one themselves. 

When Kamer visited New York in November he got 15 different drivers to rate him one star and ended up with an average rating of 1.8.  

Kamer told Business Insider that he 'is the first one to get a 1-star average, but it doesn't mean I'm a bad passenger, it just means I convinced fifteen drivers to give me a low rating.

An Uber driver with a rating below four stars runs the risk of losing his position with the company.
