CHILTON PITS... AT THE WRONG TIME!

Britain’s Max Chilton was penalised after he rather embarrassingly took to the pit-lane while the race was red flagged.

Chilton required a new front wing after an errant tyre hit his Marussia following Kimi Raikkonen’s first-lap smash.

But it is against the rules to enter the pits while the race is suspended and Chilton (right) was subsequently hit with a  drive-through penalty.

Of the accident itself, Chilton said: ‘It was like an explosion.’

HARRY'S HOME FROM HOME

Prince Harry was in the paddock with Sir Jackie Stewart, the three-time World Champion, his tour guide.

They started, quite notably, at Bernie Ecclestone’s motorhome. After a five-minute date with the Formula One ringmaster, they then headed for the homes of Mercedes and McLaren and were spotted in Williams’ sparkly new motorhome, too.

In talks: Prince Harry having an in-depth discussion with Sir Jackie Stewart in the paddock at Silverstone

RICCIARDO GETS BETTER OF VETTEL AGAIN

Daniel Ricciardo secured another podium finish in what has been an impressive campaign for the Red Bull man.

Incredibly, in the five races that he and team-mate Sebastian Vettel have both finished this season, Vettel, the four-time World Champion, is yet to get the better of his junior team-mate.

In contrast, Felipe Massa’s 200th grand prix lasted just four corners after he smashed into Raikkonen.

DELAY WAS A TURN-OFF, SAYS LAUDA

Niki Lauda expressed his fury at the one-hour delay as repairs were made to the guardrail on the Wellington Straight following Kimi Raikkonen’s shunt in the opening lap.

‘It’s all crazy,’ the predictably outspoken  three-time World Champion said. ‘To stop the race for one hour because one of the barriers is damaged is ridiculous.

‘The chances of it happening again are zero. A lot of people will switch the TV off.’
