Australian jihadist widow Zehra Duman is believed to be using social media to try and recruit other young women to join the Islamic State and become Jihadi brides in Syria.

The 21-year-old woman fled to Syria from Melbourne and married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif - known as ‘The Playboy Jihadi - who was killed five weeks later.

The young woman is using website ask.fm to speak candidly and answer anonymous questions about herself; including her grief over her dead husband, life as a Jihadi Bride and her parents’ reaction to her decision to flee to Syria.

Vanished: Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif, married 

A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France

When asked how her parents reacted when she left for Syria, Duman opened up about her parents’ anguish.

‘They were shocked, as I never have been public with my Jihadi views,’ she wrote.

‘But also heartbroken, as my mum was very close to me… and she knows she will never see me again.’  

The 21-year-old also describes her grief for her husband, to whom she was married for five weeks as ‘we got married in December, and he got Shahada in January’.

‘Every day, there’s not a moment I don’t think of (my husband),’ she writes.

‘He was the perfect husband. Had such a beautiful heart, and character.

‘Allah didn’t want to keep him here in filthy Dunya.’

The young recruiter, who also calls herself ‘Umm Abdullatif’, gives a glowing review of and tells curious people posing questions ‘you need to come and see for yourself’.

One minute, she is gushing that: ‘the lifestyle here is amazing, it is something you need to see for yourself’.

The next, Duman states that she is well-armed with ‘a klash, a pistol, a few knives, also a bunch of grenades’.

She says she is ‘more than happy’ to look for husbands for people, and then urges them to continue the conversation with her using another app, such as Kik or Surespot.

When asked ‘what do you miss about Australia?’ she responds ‘0’, confirming her intention to never return.

Worse still, the Jihadi Bride explains that although women are currently not allowed to fight, she eagerly awaits the moment she can enter the conflict in the hope of becoming a martyr.

‘They dont need sisters to fight… we have our lions ♡ but maybe one day soon, it just might happen... which i cannot wait for (sic),’ she wrote. 

Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he '

Vile caption: The former Melbourne woman sprayed a series of hateful messages on social media on 

Despite confessing that she expects to die, the young woman is adamant that is not fearful.

‘Whats there to be scared of? We have Allah,’ she wrote.

However, Duman appears to threaten one user when one user says: 'Imagine one day the Yazedis take all Muhajirat as Slaves.' 

The Melbourne jihadi bride retaliates by saying: 'Imagine one day the Muhajirat take you as a slave...' 

The brazen 21-year-old also confirms that she is in contact with other Melbourne women who have already fled to Syria, writing: ‘I do know a few Melbourne sisters.’ 

Duman is now renowned for being provocative and confrontation on social media, particularly through her Twitter use. 

In a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen.

In March photographs were posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to the former Melbourne woman, depicting several women standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress.

In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?'

Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' 

Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. 

It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'.

Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 

'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr.

The identities of the jihadist women in Ms Duman's pictures are unclear. 

However, the BMW bears resemblance to the same vehicle Australian jihadist and former underworld figure Mohammed Elomar was pictured smirking and wielding a Glock next to in September 2014.

Defensive: Zehra Duman justified boasting about her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - but was then forced to defend the posts, telling her followers to 'chill n stop jujjing'

Shortly after boasting about the expensive vehicle, Duman became defensive on social media and said 'no one is trying to be flashy'

'The m5 was driven here from france (sic) and is meant to be sold here. Chill n stop (judging). No one is trying to be flashy in sham (Syria).'  

Duman fled Australia late last year, leaving behind a distraught family, who told reporters she had been 'brainwashed'. 

The tweets, pictured here, have since been deleted

The Herald Sun quoted her father, Duvat Duman, saying: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' 

Khaled Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton is among the Australian females who have joined the Islamic State.

Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reported dead in a suicide bombing in Ramadi, Iraq, last week.
