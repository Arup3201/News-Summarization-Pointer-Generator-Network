Nigel Pearson’s tenure at Leicester City descended into farce on Sunday night with the club forced to release a statement insisting they had not sacked him.

Members of Pearson’s backroom staff had been told he had left, 24 hours after he grabbed Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur by the throat. 

But Leicester, after more than three hours of silence despite his ‘sacking’ being widely reported, eventually confirmed that he will be staying — for now.

6.30PM The story breaks that Nigel Pearson has been sacked by Leicester

8.00PM Fans and ex-players react, with Gary Lineker tweeting: ‘Not surprised Pearson has been fired.’

9.45PM After hours of silence from the club, reports begin to leak that Pearson may still be in charge.

10.07PM Leicester finally release a statement saying that Pearson has NOT been sacked...

10.12PM ... but too late to stop ITV News reporting that he has gone.

‘Contrary to media speculation on Sunday evening, Nigel remains the club’s first team manager,’ said the statement. ‘Reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation. Nigel, his staff and the first-team squad are focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.’

That was in stark contrast to what Pearson and his staff believed earlier on Sunday. In the morning Pearson feared the worst after chief executive Susan Wheeler had been summoned to Thailand to see the club’s owners the Srivaddhanaprabha family.

And news of Pearson’s ‘sacking’ even made ITV’s 10pm news at the same time Leicester released their statement.

His job had been in the spotlight after he put his hands around McArthur’s throat while the Palace man was lying down on the touchline during Saturday’s home defeat which left Leicester rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table. McArthur cried out ‘get off me’, but the Leicester boss dismissed the incident as a playful confrontation.

Pearson and McArthur have history after Leicester agreed a fee to sign the player from Wigan last summer only for the deal to collapse at the last minute.

‘I have no problem with the lad,’ said Pearson after Saturday’s incident. ‘He’s a likeable lad. I’m as disappointed as he was with how things (his transfer) panned out. But it’s the other club (Wigan) who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn’t quite right. And a certain manager (then Wigan boss Uwe Rosler), who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut.’

Pearson was at the centre of controversy earlier in the season after arguing with Leicester fans. Footage emerged in December showing him telling a fan to ‘**** off and die’ during the 3-1 home defeat against Liverpool. But the 51-year-old offered a relaxed interpretation of events and refused to apologise.
