A dying man ended up living in poverty after his 'good Samaritan' neighbour stole his savings to buy scratchcards and designer clothes, a court heard.

Carlos Machado, 55, was supposedly caring for Brian 
Farlow, who lived in the same apartment block, but instead plundered his bank account, transferring more than £25,000 to himself.

Cancer patient Mr Farlow, 63 was left living in squalor with rotting food in
 his kitchen, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

Mr Farlowe's living situation was uncovered by his family when they visited his flat in Whitham, Essex, in 2011.

Mr Farlow died from lung and bone cancer in November, two months after his family found out what was happening, the court heard.

Machado was able to take advantage of the 63-year-old after Mr Farlow had signed an authorisation 
form allowing Machado to withdraw money from his account with his permission.

The court heard £25,255 belonging to Mr Farlow had passed through Machado's bank account, all of which had been spent.

Prosecutors alleged Machado stole £45,000 from Mr Farlow and spent it on scratchcards, gambling and designer clothing.

Machado claimed the amount involved was £15,000 and it was always his intention to pay it back.

He told the court one way he was going
 to return the money was to take part in the TV quiz show Deal or No 
Deal, but show bosses said he never applied.

Richard Conley, mitigating, told the court Machado had serious mental health problems, adding that Machado's condition had worsened in the past year.

Judge Charles Gratwicke said Machado's actions were a serious breach of trust, as he sentenced him to two years suspended prison sentence, 200 hours of unpaid work and imposed a mental health treatment order.

Machado has no assets that can be seized but if his financial circumstances improve, the authorities can pursue him in a bid to recoup the money at a later date.

Machado had denied stealing £45,000 and a jury could not agree on a verdict after a trial in January.

He was found guilty of fraud by abusing his position, but was cleared of seven other fraud and theft charges.
