Tickling, over-eating and drinking wedding leftovers from a chamber pot are all marriage-related rituals that make the tradition of saving tier of wedding cake seem completely mundane.

An interactive collection of wedding traditions from around the world highlights some very strange practices from the past and the present - including organised weeping before the big day in China, to negotiating the price of a bride in pigs in Papua New Guinea.

However, the infographic also serves to highlight the cost of a ceremony and the plight of child brides around the world.

You may now spit at the bride: An interactive collection of wedding traditions from around the world highlights some very strange practices from the past and the present, including organised weeping before the big day in China and spitting at the bride, to negotiating the price of a bride in pigs in Papua New Guinea

In Chinese Inner Mongolia, the bride and groom in the Daur community have to kill a baby chick together in order to set a date for their wedding.

There is one parallel with the cutting of the cake in Western wedding ceremonies as the couple have to kill the animal with the same knife – grasping it together.

They then inspect the innards of the chick until they locate the liver and if it is in good condition, they can start organising their nuptials.

While many Western brides try to shed a few pounds before their big day, the opposite is true in Mauritania, where obesity is traditionally regarded as desirable.

Girls as young as five are ‘force-fed’ a diet of rich, fatty foods and older women force brides-to-be to consume enormous amounts in order to make them as attractive as possible to potential suitors.

The practice of force feeding or ‘Leblouh’ dates from the 11th century when being overweight was a sign of wealth and is still relevant today, according to the PurelyDiamonds.co.uk, the British company that produced the infographic.

The father of the bride spits on the breasts and face of his daughter for luck before she is wed in Kenya and members of the Tidong tribe in the city of Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia are forbidden to go to the toilet for three days before the wedding because they believe that the ritual brings the couple luck and will prevent infidelity and the death of their children.

While most weddings are happy occasions, the Tujia people in Sichuan, China cry in advance of a wedding.

The bride cries for an hour a day one whole month before she is due to wed and is later joined by her mother and grandmother in her weeping. The tradition is said to stem from the time when a mother of a Chinese princess sobbed profusely at her daughter’s wedding.

The big day can also include strange traditions. In India at a certain astrological time, ‘maglik’ women have to marry a banana or peepal tree, or an idol of the Hindu god Visnu in a ceremony known as ‘kumbh vivah’.

Once the ceremony has taken place, the tree is destroyed and the ceremony is intended to break any potential curse over the bride and groom.

Centuries ago in France, a married couple were sent to bed while the bridal party cleaned up the mess from a raucous reception and collected all the leftover food and drink in a chamber pot – which the happy couple were forced to drink together.

It was meant to give them strength and vitality for their wedding night and while the ritual no longer exists, sometimes chocolate and champagne is served out of a vessel that looks like a chamber pot.

As well as unusual marriage preparations, the big day can also include strange traditions. In India at a certain astrological time, 'maglik' women have to marry a banana or peepal tree, or an idol of the Hindu god Visnu in a ceremony known as 'kumbh vivah'

Before couples can tie the knot, men have to get their girl. In Niger, if a young man is interested in a girl, he will sneak up to the home which she shares with her parents and tickle her ear.

Later, a goat is sacrificed at the wedding, which takes place during a full moon, and afterwards, a camel is made to dance for guests to drum beats at a reception.

People in remote parts of Papua New Guinea have to negotiate the price of a bride with her parents, which is measured in pigs and shells. ‘Low quality’ brides fetch just one or two pigs, while beauties can be worth more than 30. These pigs are often eaten as part of a wedding feast.

A fishy tradition: From negotiating the price of a bride in pigs to crying for days on end, there are many traditions in preparation for the big day but after the main event, some people in Korea beat the soles of the groom's feet with fish to make him stronger for life ahead with his wife

Despite the legal age of consent being 21, Papua New Guinea has the 5th highest rate of child marriages in the world.

The infographic includes serious information, such as that one in seven girls is married off before they reach their 15th birthday.

In Malaysia, 16,000 girls are married before the age of 15 and in Niger, over one third are married by the same age.

The infographic also talks about countries where polygamist marriages are legal and outlines the average cost of weddings in different countries.
