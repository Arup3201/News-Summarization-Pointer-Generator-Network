The lawyer for one of the two 18-year-olds charged with circulating rape pictures of a teenage girl who later hanged herself says his client is being persecuted by a 'cyber-lynch mob.'

The tragic suicide in April of Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year-old high school student from Nova Scotia, Canada, brought international attention to her claims that she was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex.

Much of the bullying was a result of a photo the circulated at her school that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a window.

The two 18-year-olds are charged with child pornography. One is accused of taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it. Because the alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed. 

'Victim': She was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010

Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place

They were both in court today with their parents for a brief appearance. The judge set a trial for September 19. 

Josh Arnold, the attorney for one of the men, told CTV News that his client has already been convicted in the court of public opinion.

'The Internet mavens and some members of the media have acted like a lynch mob in relation to this matter. They've tried and convicted this person without any due process whatsoever,' he said.

Rehtaeh's heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying and torment at school.

Her uncle was furious about the attorney's allegations.

'This man's saying that these boys have been prosecuted in the media.That hasn't been the case. That's not true,' Michael Parsons said.

A handful of protestors turned out to the courthouse where the suspects in the Rehtaeh case were due to appear

'This case has been brought forward in the media. Because, it was only through the media participation that this case is even being looked at today.'

He also said he is praying for the two accused.

'I have to pray for these boys. I have to pray for them to become good men. That's the hardest thing for me to do. But it's something I have to do. That's what's hard. If you want to know the truth that's the hardest thing to do,' he told the CBC.

'I have absolutely no faith in the RCMP or the Halifax city police or the Crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case, they totally dropped the ball.'

Retaeh's death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying.

Tragedy: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, took her life in April after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape

Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged 
16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with 
alcohol, she told her mother days after.

Her
mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her 
daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window.

Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cpl Scott MacRae said they arrested two 
males today. 

Investigators said they are being questioned and no 
further information will be released at this time.

'Due to the sensitive nature around this investigation, the 
investigators do want to ensure that no court process is affected,' 
MacRae said.

The arrests came after someone came 
forward in April and provided new information and said they were willing
to verify who the suspects are.

'We're just hopeful there's charges laid and others to arrest, hoping 
that they're finally willing to tell their side of the story,' Leah 
Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, said.

'A sense of relief came over me that at least they're going to be questioned.'

Last month Leah and her husband spoke to People magazine about their daughter's tragic death. 

'When Rehtaeh was born, I promised her the world. Now my beautiful girl is gone,' Leah said.

She started smoking pot to 'numb her emotions' and deal with Facebook messages and texts that came through by the dozen.

They read things like: 'Sluts are not welcome here' and 'everyone knew exactly what you have done'.

Rehtaeh
eventually closed down her Facebook page because there were so many men
asking her to have sex with them. They would say: ‘You had sex with my 
friend, so why not me?’

The response from the school was, apparently, to do very little. Halifax school board spokesman Doug Hadley has said that none of the boys were spoken to.

Her father, Glen Canning, told People: 'My 
daughter wasn't bullied to death, she was disappointed to death. 
Disappointed in people she thought she could trust, her school, and the 
police.'

Left behind: Her father said she killed herself out of disappointment in her
school, her former friends and law enforcement officers who failed to 
help her

Rehtaeh's death prompted the Nova Scotia government to launch reviews of
the RCMP's original investigation and the school board's handling of 
the matter.

An 
independent review released in June concluded the Halifax Regional 
School Board could have done a better job, but it was hindered by the 
fact that Rehtaeh was often absent from class.
