The trend for trying to take a good selfie is nothing new but with the evolution of the selfie stick or monopod people are trying so much harder to get that perfect photo. 

It's a regular site at tourist attractions like the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, people with their selfie sticks out trying to get that shot they will post Facebook, Twitter or Instragram. 

Despite the help of a three-foot metal stick people are still getting it wrong and end up with the stick actually in the photo. 

Sydney Fashion Blogger posted this selfie on Instragram and its had thousands of likes, but she forgot to leave the stick out of her posy picture

The selfie stick is becoming a regular fixture among normal social activities like BBQs, holidays, sports events and parties. 

The trend for cameras on sticks, also known as monopods, isn’t new and a number of sticks are already available for digital cameras from companies including Opteka and XShot.

But monopods designed especially for smartphones, however, were unveiled at this year’s Mobile World Congress, including a Samsung version from Chinese firm Winners’ Sun Plastic Electronics.

This amazing backdrop would have looked much better if the photographer had left out the 'selfie stick'

1. Don't have the stick in the picture.  

2. Capture the best angle, try turning your head a few degrees to the right or left, your features will appear less flat 

3. Show off something new in your selfie like haircut or new item of clothing

4. Enhance one of your features e.g. wear lots of mascara or a bright lipstick and keep the rest natural 

5. You need good lighting for the best selfies. 

6. Use the phone's back camera because it will take a higher resolution picture. 

7. Think about what background you want, the best selfies have something interesting behind the subject. 

It is a trend that's especially popular in Asia, including Indonesia.

Soulaya Lestary, 20, from Indonesia, told The Huffington Post: 'We use social media all the time and because we’re shy to ask someone, [to] take picture of us,’ it’s easier to do it ourselves.'

Meanwhile, a number of existing monopods can be used with iPhones, from companies including Interfit.

They work by holding the camera in landscape mode, with the screen facing the photographer and using the front-facing camera.

Buttons on the handle of the stick are used to control the device.

Depending on the model, some monopods will manually press the shutter button on the side of phone using an arm, or similar, while others connect remotely via Bluetooth and take the photo using software controls.

Makati City in the Philippines is the selfie capital of the World, reported time.com in March this year.
