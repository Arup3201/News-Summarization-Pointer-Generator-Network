Alex Salmond's bank account was accessed by a reporter working for the Observer newspaper, he told the Leveson Inquiry.

Scotland's First Minister claims a former journalist from the paper told him they were intrigued by a payment made in 1999 to a shop called 'Fun and Games'.

He inferred that journalists at the Sunday paper had hoped that the purchase was of an adult nature and would reveal something salacious about his private life.

But in reality he had gone to a toy shop to buy a gift for his young nieces, he told Lord Justice Leveson's Inquiry into media standards.

'Account accessed': Mr Salmond claimed The Observer accessed his bank records in 1999, a claim the newspaper have denied

Mr Salmond claimed the paper accessed his account in the run-up to the 1999 Scottish election.

However, the Observer have denied Mr Salmond's claims.

He said: 'My bank account was accessed by the 
Observer newspaper some time ago, in 1999, and my reason for believing 
that is I was informed by a former Observer journalist.'

The revelation has 'coloured his view' of press standards, he said. Mr Salmond said the journalist gave him details of what was in his account.

He added: 'I had
bought some toys for my then at that time young nieces in a toy shop which was called Fun and Games.

'The person 
who informed me told me that this caused great anticipation and hope in 
the Observer investigation unit because they believed that perhaps Fun 
and Games was more than a conventional toy shop..

He continued: 'The point I'm making is the person 
concerned had detail which could only have been known by somebody who 
had full access to my bank account at that stage.'

Courting Murdoch: Alex Salmond told the Leveson Inquiry today that he has met Rupert Murdoch five times in the last five years

Separately, the First Minister said there was no evidence that he had been a victim of phone-hacking.

This afternoon the Guardian Media Group denied Mr Salmond's claims and said they had investigated them fully.

A spokesman said: 'Mr Salmond first raised the matter of an alleged unauthorised access of his bank account with the Observer's Editor last year.

'The allegation was that a journalist working for the Observer had accessed his bank details in 1999.

'As we explained to him last year, on the basis of the information he had given us, we have been unable to find any evidence to substantiate his allegation.

'As our response to him at the time made clear, we take this allegation very seriously and if he is able to provide us with any more information we will investigate further.'

Bank claims: The Observer, the sister paper of the Guardian who are based in Kings Place, London, said there was no evidence they had accessed Mr Salmond's account

Mr Salmond has repeatedly refused to 
answer questions at the Scottish Parliament on whether he had been the 
victim of phone hacking, leading to accusations he has treated Holyrood 
with contempt.

The First Minister always insisted the Leveson Inquiry was the correct place to air the issues.

On wider Scottish press behaviour, he said: 'More recently I think we'd have to accept, given the information which has now been into the hands of the police in Scotland, there are a significant, perhaps proportionally less but significant Scottish examples of possible criminality.'

A number of Scots have been informed by police over the past year that people may have been victims of 'illegality'.

He criticised the Metropolitan Police for not handing over information quickly about possible criminal acts to Scottish police.

'It's only in the last few months that Strathclyde Police have examined all of that information and informed the potential victims of the possibility of criminal acts against them,' he said.

'That seems to me a highly undesirable situation and something similar applies to possible breaches of data protection as well.'

The Scottish National Party leader has also faced pressure from his opponents about his relationship with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, whose News of the World tabloid was closed amid the phone hacking scandal.

Mr Salmond told the inquiry he had been in favour of the Murdoch's BSkyB bid.

'I was in favour of what benefited the Scottish economy,' he said.

'Remember I have no responsibility for broadcasting policy, I have no responsibility for plurality in the press but I do have a responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland.'

He added: 'I would tend to put an emphasis on the jobs and investment aspects of this. It was for others to consider other matters.'

Mr Salmond said he was prepared to argue the case for jobs and investment with Vince Cable, then Jeremy Hunt, but never got the chance.

He said the issue of the BSkyB bid was never brought up in discussions about newspaper support.

'If for example I'd believed that the merger of the consolidation of ownership of BSkyB would have resulted in the diminution of Scottish jobs then I would have been perfectly prepared to argue against it,' he said.

Also, he said he never got a direct answer on potential support from Mr Murdoch for the SNP.

Mr Salmond said: 'I wouldn't explicitly raise it at meetings necessarily because they'd always say "go to the editors".

'That certainly was Rupert Murdoch's practice, and I can't even remember, it may have cropped up in a James Murdoch meeting, but if so, he would say 'go to the editors. and go to the editors I did, as I say, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.'

The Sun newspaper famously depicted Scotland in a noose in a warning against voting SNP in the 2007 Scottish election. The paper changed its position to back Mr Salmond for a second term as First Minister in 2011.

Mr Salmond said he had five meetings with Mr Murdoch over five years.'It's perfectly reasonable,' he argued. 'It's not in the same league, if I may say, as Mr Blair or Mr Brown or Mr Cameron, but nonetheless, that's five times in five years.

'I saw Murdoch's evidence. I don't demur from that at all. He said he didn't know me well, and that's fair.

'Often we were discussing Scotland and his Scottish ancestry. The fact that his grandfather was the Church of Scotland minister in my old constituency of Banff and Buchan in Cruden Bay, for example, so there were a range of things for discussion.'
