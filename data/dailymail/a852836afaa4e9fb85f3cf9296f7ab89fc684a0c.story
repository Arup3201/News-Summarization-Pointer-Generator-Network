Ten of thousands of birds flying over California are being scorched to death each year by powerful sun beams from the world's largest solar plant.

The birds have been dubbed 'streamers' by workers at the plant in the Mojave Desert, for the smoke plume that comes from them as they ignite in midair.

Federal wildlife investigators visited the BrightSource Energy plant last year and watched as birds burned and fell, reporting an average of one 'streamer' every two minutes.

Body count: Some experts estimate the Ivanpah Dry Lake solar plant in California scorches around 30,000 birds per year in mid-air

They are now are urging California officials to halt the operator's application to build a still-bigger version of the plant.

Estimates per year now range from a low of about a thousand by BrightSource to 28,000 by an expert for the Center for Biological Diversity environmental group.

The deaths are 'alarming. It's hard to say whether that's the location or the technology,' said Garry George, renewable-energy director for the California chapter of the Audubon Society. 'There needs to be some caution.'

The bird deaths mark the latest instance in which the quest for clean energy sometimes has inadvertent environmental harm.

Debate: Plant officials dispute that all the streamers are caused by birds.

Solar farms have been criticised for their impacts on desert tortoises, and wind farms have killed birds, including numerous raptors.

'We take this issue very seriously,' said Jeff Holland, a spokesman for NRG Solar of Carlsbad, California, the second of the three companies behind the plant.

The third, Google, deferred comment to its partners.

Wildlife officials who witnessed the phenomena say many of the clouds of smoke were too big to come from anything but a bird, and they add that they saw the 'birds entering the solar flux and igniting, consequently become a streamer.'

 The $2.2 billion (£1.32 billion) plant, which launched 
in February, is at Ivanpah Dry Lake near the California-Nevada border. 
The operator says it is the world's biggest plant to employ so-called 
power towers.

More than 
300,000 mirrors, each the size of a garage door, reflect solar rays onto
 three boiler towers each looming up to 40 stories high. The water 
inside is heated to produce steam, which turns turbines that generate 
enough electricity for 140,000 homes.

Sun rays sent up by the field of mirrors are bright enough to dazzle pilots flying in and out of Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

Federal wildlife officials 
said Ivanpah might act as a 'mega-trap' for wildlife, with the bright 
light of the plant attracting insects, which in turn attract 
insect-eating birds that fly to their death in the intensely focused 
light rays.

Federal and 
state biologists call the number of deaths significant, based on 
sightings of birds getting singed and falling, and on retrieval of 
carcasses with feathers charred too severely for flight.

Ivanpah
 officials dispute the source of the so-called streamers, saying at 
least some of the puffs of smoke mark insects and bits of airborne trash
 being ignited by the solar rays.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials say they want a death toll for a full year of operation.

Given the apparent scale of bird deaths at Ivanpah, authorities should thoroughly track bird kills there for a year, including during annual migratory seasons, before granting any more permits for that kind of solar technology, said Mr George, of the Audubon Society.

The toll on birds has been surprising, said Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission. 'We didn't see a lot of impact' on birds at the first, smaller power towers in the U.S. and Europe, Weisenmiller said.

The commission is now considering the application from Oakland-based BrightSource to build a mirror field and a 75-story power tower that would reach above the sand dunes and creek washes between Joshua Tree National Park and the California-Arizona border.

The proposed plant is on a flight path for birds between the Colorado River and California's largest lake, the Salton Sea — an area, experts say, is richer in avian life than the Ivanpah plant, with protected golden eagles and peregrine falcons and more than 100 other species of birds recorded there.

Unsettling: Authorities at the plant call the trails of smoke left by scorched birds 'streamers'

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials warned California this month that the power-tower style of solar technology holds 'the highest lethality potential' of the many solar projects burgeoning in the deserts of California.

The commission's staff estimates the proposed new tower would be almost four times as dangerous to birds as the Ivanpah plant. The agency is expected to decide this autumn on the proposal.

While biologists say there is no known feasible way to curb the number of birds killed, the companies behind the projects say they are hoping to find one — studying whether lights, sounds or some other technology would scare them away, said Joseph Desmond, senior vice president at BrightSource Energy.

BrightSource also is offering $1.8 (£1.08) million in compensation for anticipated bird deaths at Palen, Desmond said.

The company is proposing the money for programs such as those to spay and neuter domestic cats, which a government study found kill over 1.4 billion birds a year.

Opponents say that would do nothing to help the desert birds at the proposed site.

Power-tower proponents are fighting to keep the deaths from forcing a pause in the building of new plants when they see the technology on the verge of becoming more affordable and accessible, said Thomas Conroy, a renewable-energy expert.

When it comes to powering the country's grids, 'diversity of technology ... is critical,' Mr Conroy said.

'Nobody should be arguing let's be all coal, all solar,' all wind, or all nuclear. 'And every one of those technologies has a long list of pros and cons.'
