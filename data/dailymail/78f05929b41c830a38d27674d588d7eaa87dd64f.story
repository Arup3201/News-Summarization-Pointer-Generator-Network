A baby gorilla born less than a month ago at the Milwaukee County Zoo has unexpectedly died, the zoo said Thursday.

The western lowland gorilla, named Kassiu, which is pronounced CASH'-yoo, was born March 19 to 13-year-old mother Naku and 27-year-old father Cassius.

Zookeepers reported the baby girl and mother appeared normal Wednesday morning. But by the afternoon, Kassiu appeared weak and stopped holding onto her mother, as newborn gorillas do, the zoo said in a statement.

The zoo's medical staff examined the baby and gave her fluids, glucose and antibiotics. A neonatologist and pediatrician were also called in, but Kassiu died Wednesday evening.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine was expected to perform a complete necropsy, or animal autopsy.

Preliminary results were expected within a few days but a complete report might take several months, depending on the cause of death.

The last gorilla birth at the zoo was in 1992.

Kassiu was the first offspring for both her mother and father. Rafert said Naku is being consoled by the baby's father.

'She knows,' Rafert told CBS 58. 'You don't have a baby and lose it and not know.'

Staff at the zoo are heartbroken by the loss of the tiny primate.

'The
 worst is not knowing. Is it something we could have done?' Jan W. 
Rafert, the zoo's curator of primates and small mammals told JS Online.

Unexpected death: Up until Wednesday, Kassiu appeared to be in perfect health, and Naku was a capable mother, say zoo staff

'The first week was the most critical and we got through that. Everything's looking good and then all of sudden, out of the blue, this happens.'

Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, but are more common than their relatives, the mountain gorillas.

Western lowland gorillas live in heavy rain forests, and it's difficult for scientists to accurately estimate how many survive in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Gabon, Angola, and possibly the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the zoo.
