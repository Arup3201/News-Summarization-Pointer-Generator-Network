Terry Ditrich had her first car - a Corvette Stingray - stolen from the parking lot of her work six months after she bought it in Duluth, Georgia, in 1972.

At the time police said the car was a likely stripped of its parts and dumped in the Chattahoochee River.

But the cops recently called her saying it had been found, 42 years after it was taken from her.

The only problem is that she no longer actually owns it. 

Finally found: This Corvette Stingray was stolen from its owner in 1972, but has now turned up, thanks to the smarts of a car restorer who recently bought it

Well-kept: The car is in exceptional condition, the only problem is that the original owner no longer owns it

Impounded: Owner Terry Dietrich now needs a court order to get her car back after 42 years

The new owner, car restorer Gary Green, bought it from a widow in North Carolina.

Green checked the vehicle identification number (VIN) and realized it matched a 1969 Corvette convertible and thought something was amiss.

He the realized there was another VIN stamped into the frame and engine.

Green called police, who verified the car was stolen in November 1972.

The car was impounded and Dietrich was told it had been found, all these years later.

However, Dietrich had financed and insured the car through Allstate, who paid out the title when it was stolen.

That gave Allstate legal ownership of the car.

Now, neither Allstate nor the state of Georgia can provide a title to Dietrich.

'If I could get that car back, it could roll back up the same driveway, pull back into the same carport it left 11-14-72. How awesome is that?' Dietrich told 11 Alive.

Great condition: The car was looked after very well by its former owner

Slick: Interestingly, owner Terry Dietrich lives in the same place she did when the car was stolen

Reunion: Dietrich hopes the car will finally be returned to her after all this time

Flashback: This is a photo of Terry Dietrich taken around the time the car was stolen in 1972

Dietrich now needs a court order in order to get the car released to her.

However she says she can't afford to get one.

Without a court order the car will stay impounded and eventually be auctioned off.

'If I cannot have the car back, I do not want to see it,' Dietrich told 11 Alive.

'And I will have to get over (losing it) all again.'

Hot rod: Unless a court order allows her car be released, it’ll head off to police auction for the highest bidder
