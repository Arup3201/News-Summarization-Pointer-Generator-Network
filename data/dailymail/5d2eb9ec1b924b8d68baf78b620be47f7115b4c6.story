Tim Cahill faced up to the end of his World Cup dream after scoring one of the greatest goals in the tournament's history.

The 34-year-old Australia striker evoked memories of Marco van Basten's wondergoal at Euro '88 with a stunning volley against Holland on Wednesday.

Cahill crashed a fantastic 20-metre volley into the roof of the net in the 21st minute of the Group B clash in Porto Alegre.

TV presenter and Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted: 'I'm calling it, best World Cup goal of all time.'

It was his fifth goal in three World Cups.

But 20 minutes later, Cahill then showed his bad side with a late challenge on Bruno Martins Indi, who was taken off on a stretcher, to earn a booking which sees the Australia talisman suspended for the final group game with Spain.

Martins Indi was taken to a hospital for tests after suffering a suspected concussion.

Holland coach Louis van Gaal says that if tests confirm a concussion, the Feyenoord defender will be sidelined for a week and miss the last Group B match against Chile.

Cahill had said this World Cup would be his swansong and Australia's elimination was confirmed when Chile later beat Spain 2-0.
