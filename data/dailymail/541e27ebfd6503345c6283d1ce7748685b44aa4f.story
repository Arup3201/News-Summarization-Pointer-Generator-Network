A northeast Florida high school has barred a student from saying 'God bless America' while delivering morning announcements on campus after complaints from two atheist students.

And the decision has seen locals - mostly parents and church-goers - come together in protest.

The atheist students at Yulee High in Nassau County took their complaints to the Appignani Humanist Association - a Washington-based firm - before telling the school and the group's lawyers sent a letter threatening the school with a lawsuit.

First Coast News reported that the group said it is 'inappropriate and unlawful' for a public school to use God in an official statement.  

Not happy: Demonstrators form outside Yulee High School on Friday after a student was told he can no longer say 'God Bless America' during his morning announcements

'We do not have the right to remain silent': The protesters say they are standing up for the student

Yulee High School received a letter from the American Humanist Organization over the phrase 'God Bless America', which a student had been saying each morning

They said that even though they were the words of a student, they were being made on behalf of the school because it was an announcement.

In response, the school district said students were free to express their beliefs all day long, but not during school announcements. 

That caused demonstrators to form outside the school on Friday.

They say they want to stand up for the student who was reprimanded, believing he did nothing wrong.

'We want to let him know he should not be ashamed, that he did the right thing,' local Kathy Parker told News4Jax. 

'I don't see what this young man has done wrong.

'We need to stand out here and stand up for him.

'I think everyone has the right of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. 

'I hope he does it again.'

Complaint: This is the first page of the letter the American Humanist Association sent a letter to the school's principal, threatening legal action if the school did not respond within seven days

The principal, Natasha Drake, hit back at reports the school had ok-ed the 'God Bless America' part of his speech. 

'The student on his own accord made the statement,' Drake wrote to the Appignani Humanist Association, according to News4Jax.

'I have called the student in this morning and directed him that at no time is he to add or take away from announcements that have been pre-approved and that if he did it again, he would no longer have the privilege of making the morning announcements. 

'I am disappointed that the students who filed the complaint did not do so with me first, as I would have addressed it immediately.'

A district representative stressed the student at the center of the issue is not in trouble and has not been removed from the announcements - but he was told not to say 'God Bless America.
