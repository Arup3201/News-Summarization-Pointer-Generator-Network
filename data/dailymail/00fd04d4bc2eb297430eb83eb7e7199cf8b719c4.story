Clinically obese Chris Dune, who weighed in at 310lb, or just over 22st, deployed his passion for technology in his quest to lose weight, tracking all aspects of his food intake, activities and excursions.

Chris, 45, is an independent consultant based in Denver and works extensively with technology. As part of his job, he is connected up to hundreds of data-tracking tools, leading his nickname as 'the most quantified human on earth'.

Chris eventually realised he could use these tools to lose weight: ‘Looking at that data brings up an 
amazing array of life hacks that you can use. I like to think of it as 
fast-track enlightenment.’

Chris admits he used to smoke, drink and eat too much and felt his job allowed him to continue his bad habits

Chris knew his weight was an issue and 
dangerous for his health, but had previously struggled to stick to any 
diet that saw him lose significant amounts in the long-term.

‘I never had a good relationship with food even as a child - I was a little bit heavy and you get made fun of you say “OK that’s what this is like".'

Using his own high-tech method, Chris managed to lose over 9st in a year and a half, dropping from 22st (left) to 13st 9lb (right)

Then came a moment of enlightenment, when he realised he could use his passion for data and technology to tackle his weight.

‘Everyone needs to understand that the average person touches between 100 to 400 systems a day, whether it’s swiping a credit card or going past a speed camera or using the phone,' he says.

‘When you start to think about what we could do with that information it opens up a world of possibilities .

‘I just put that same paradigm onto everything else, like if I’m tracking my calories I can dig into that data and find out what causes me to eat extra calories. It lets me look at what I did that day, who I saw, how I slept, what I watched, what I listened to.'

Chris used his love of data collecting gadgets (left) to help him see where he was going wrong in his diet and began to record (right) and analyse all aspects of his body and eating habits 

Chris maintained bad eating habits developed in childhood, and felt his success at his job allowed him to justify his bad habits

Chris says he knew he was overweight and hated to look at pictures of himself

Chris has earned the nickname of the most quantified human in the world through his job which allows him to test apps and gadgets that collect personal data

Chris began by taking pictures of his meals and posting them on Instagram to get a clearer picture of  where and what he was eating as well as activating geo-tagging on his credit card so he could see where he  was splurging on food.

Using his various gadgets Chris is still continuing to lose weight

He also tracked his eating, sleeping and activity patterns, and began setting geographic limits on his credit cards, blocking him from spending at his favourite fast food restaurants or places near his home and work.

‘Often if you are overweight like I was, the most profound thing you can do is to look at your life in a quantified way. I think all men like puzzles and the more we can understand about ourselves through having a relationship with our own data the more powerful it becomes.

‘A good example is that I use systems in my home to track the temperatures and the lighting and what I’ve noticed with my own data is that the cooler it is the less I eat.

Chris’s realisations saw him shed nearly 9st from his 5ft 11in frame, dropping from 22st 1lb to 13st 9lb in a year and a half.

‘I am still losing weigh pretty fast but I am also going to the gym now. In the beginning I said I didn’t want to do the gym so I used to walk to McDonalds which was 1.1 mile and then it was kind of a fast walk to Subway which is 2.2 miles than it was running and then biking.’

Chris says that his high-tech method of weight loss can work for anyone.

‘Just start with very simple things like being aware of what you are spending on food is often more than enough.

‘A lot of grocery stores will offer you club cards and you can ask for the data.

‘There is no magic that is going to happen. You are probably not going to wake up tomorrow and start this amazing data journey. What you can do is make a choice that you are okay right now. You can help you - you are your best coach, so just be nice to that person.’
