Prince Harry is set to seal his romance with girlfriend Cressida Bonas when she introduces him to her family at a wedding in South Africa.

The third in line to the throne, who was yesterday pictured for the first time in a loving embrace with the 24-year-old dance student during a ski holiday in Switzerland, is understood to have been invited to attend the lavish nuptials of her half-sister Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, to tycoon Sir Richard Branson’s son, Sam, at his private game reserve near the Kruger National Park in two weeks’ time.

Harry, 28, is already due to fly out to Africa next week on a three day-visit to Lesotho with his charity, Sentebale. He will also be guest of honour at a black tie fundraising dinner in Johannesburg on the way home.

Sources say he is considering staying on afterwards to join ‘Cressie’ and the rest of her family for the event, which is set to be the wedding of the year.

His cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, who are close to Sam and his sister, Holly, and are holidaying with Harry this week, are also expected to attend.

The prince is said to be ‘smitten’ with the beautiful blonde, whom he began dating last summer before he was dispatched to the frontline in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter pilot.

Embrace: Harry is rumored to be meeting Cressida's parents at the wedding of Richard Branson's son

He reportedly bombarded her with 
letters, emails and calls while he was away and the pair have rekindle 
their fledging relationship on his return.

Yesterday the Mail published pictures of them openly embracing on the slopes of upmarket ski resort Verbier in front of other holidaymakers and told how they had passionately kissed at a dinner to celebrate the birthday of the prince’s uncle, Prince Andrew, the night before.

Sources say the couple partied until the early hours in a private booth at the Casbah nightclub afterwards, barely able to keep their hands off each other.

After partying until 3.30am on Tuesday a shirtless - and apparently very drunk - Harry climbed through a small rear window in order to avoid waiting photographers spotting him with his girlfriend.‘He was off his face by the time he even arrived here,’ said a member of staff. 

‘The kept him in a booth in the nightclub and pulled a curtain around it but he kept trying to escape. He even took his shirt off.

‘We had to take them [Harry and Cressida] through the window afterwards because all the paps were outside.’

Cressida is the daughter of Lady Mary Gaye Georgina Lorna Curzon, a banking heiress who was the most celebrated socialite of her day with a complicated marital history.

The daughter of the 6th Earl Howe, and a godson of King Edward V11, she has been married and divorced four times and has five children with three of her husbands. 

Cressida was the product of her third marriage to Old Harrovian entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas, which ended in divorce after six years in 1994.

His divorce proceedings resulted in him paying his ex-wife £1.2million.

For a time after her mother's fourth 
marriage to multi-millionaire financier Christopher Shaw, Cressida lived
at the National Trust-owned stately home Hinton Ampner, in Hampshire, 
where Shaw held the lease.

Lady Mary was one of the original ‘Birds of Britain’, a group of legendary Sixties cover girls who featured in a daring glossy coffee table cook by John D Green.

She posed half naked and covered in engine oil as a nod to her grand-father’s motor racing past - and subsequently admitted had to write letters of apology to her horrified aristocratic family.

She enjoyed It girl status in the sixties, and London's exclusive Claridges hotel named a cocktail mother.

Isabella is one of three children by 
her second marriage to banking magnate John Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe 
(whose family owns most of Birmingham), and was once – erroneously – 
romantically linked with Prince William.

When asked by the Daily Mail if her daughter and Prince Harry were in love yesterday, she smiled but said:  ‘I’m really sorry, I cannot say anything.’
