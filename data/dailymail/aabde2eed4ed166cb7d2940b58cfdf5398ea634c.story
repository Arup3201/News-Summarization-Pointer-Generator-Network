This is the terrifying moment a small store in Ferguson, Missouri, was looted on a night of riots over the shooting of teenager Michael Brown.

Gangs of masked thugs kick in a glass door and slide under a metal bar before fanning out to smash and steal from the business.

The footage, passed to Fox News' Sean Hannity Show, shows at least a dozen people pour in though the smashed door.

They are then pictured grabbing from fridge units and marching out again, leaving flames in their wake.

Ferguson was torn apart by riots and arson after a grand jury last week decided not to indict police officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead 18-year-old Michael Brown. 

Several businesses were looked and burned last week in the unrest.
