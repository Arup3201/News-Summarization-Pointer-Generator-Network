Brussels are set to impose a maximum power limit on gas and electric ovens next month which could threaten the Sunday roast. 

An EU ruling will require 'new energy efficiency requirements for ovens, hobs and range hoods' by next month. 

Officials insist it will cut waste and improve value for money, but critics fear it will take longer to warm up ovens to cook the Sunday joint. 

New measures will be brought on February 26 for electric and gas-fired ovens. Shops will still be able to sell existing models, but an eco-design directive will be introduced over several years.

Critics fear the planned maximum power limit on ovens mean it will take longer to cook the Sunday roast

Eurocrats say all changes will save an average household about £32 a year. 

But the measures have been criticised by some MEPs who say it is further evidence of EU chiefs meddling in our everyday lives. 

Tory MEP Daniel Hannan told the Sun on Sunday: 'If people want a low or high-powered oven, they're quite capable of deciding for themselves.

'If we banned all household appliances in Europe, it would still only cut carbon emissions by 0.5 per cent.' 

The planned changes follow a string of controversial energy-saving measures brought in by the EU and aim to cut costs, improve competitiveness and reduce carbon emissions.

Energy efficiency limit for cavities of domestic ovens:

Within one year - less than 146

Within two years - less than 121

Within five years - less than 96

For domestic (electric) hobs:

Within one year - 210 Watt-Hour 

Within three years - 200 Watt-Hour

Within five years - 195 Watt-Hour 

New measures came into effect on January 1 which demand that everything from computer modems to 'smart' televisions must have the ability to go into standby mode if no task is performed for several minutes. 

Although coffee machines bought at Christmas are likely to be exempt from the ruling, new ones must meet the stringent EU energy regulations.  

But it could prompt another retail frenzy as people rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes.

The European Commission says the changes will save consumers money on their electricity bills and be better for the environment, but critics say it will leave people with cold coffee.

The new rules state that drip filter coffee machines that have insulated jugs to keep the drink warm must power down their heated plate or element five minutes after brewing.

Those with non-insulated jugs must go on standby within 40 minutes of use. Espresso machines should turn off after half an hour.

UK Independence Party MEP Roger Helmer told the Daily Express: 'This is another example of how we are losing control over the smallest details of our affairs.

'The EU should really find something better to do. All consumers want more efficiency from household appliances to cut their energy bills but there is already enormous pressure from the market on firms to provide that. 

'EU officials apply these blanket regulations from Brussels without looking into the problems.

'This really should be a matter for the industry, the market and, perhaps, national legislation rather than yet more interference from Brussels.'

Elsewhere, traditional lightbulbs have been axed and Europe barred powerful vacuum cleaners in September in what was later dubbed 'Hoovergate' and which sparked a stampede to buy high-power models in the UK.

The directive banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and this will be further reduced to 900 watts by 2017. 

The EU is also expected to impose limits on high-power hairdryers, irons, kettles, toasters and even lawn mowers. 

A spokesman for the European Commission said: 'These policies save money, help tackle climate change and reduce energy imports from Russia and the Middle East.'
