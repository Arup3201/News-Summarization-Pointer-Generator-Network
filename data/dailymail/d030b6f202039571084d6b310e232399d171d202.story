A Denver, Colorado dispatcher has been fired after failing to relay key information to officers responding to a call from a woman who was killed 12 minutes into a 911 call.

Police say the dispatcher didn't tell officers that the woman's husband was getting a gun from a safe.

Kristine Kirk, a mother of three, was allegedly shot dead by her husband Richard while she was on the phone to 911 in April.

Mother of three: Kristine Kirk was shot dead while she was on the phone to a 911 dispatcher who police say did not update them when Kirk's situation escalated

Public safety department spokeswoman Daelene Mix said Monday the dispatcher was fired Friday. The person was not identified.

Police have said Kirk pleaded in the April 14 call for authorities to hurry and send officers because her husband had asked her to get a gun and shoot him.

Kirk said Richard Kirk was hallucinating, after having marijuana-infused candy and possibly pain pills.

When police finally arrived, officers discovered Kristine Kirk on a floor inside the home with a bullet wound to the head. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Drugs: Kristine Kirk told the dispatcher that her husband had eaten marijuana candy and was hallucinating

According to the probable cause statement, he admitted to police that he shot his wife at their home. Jackson would not say whether a gun or drugs were recovered from the home.

The couple's children may have witnessed the crime.

Police were seen escorting a little boy to a patrol car outside the home.

In a May press conference, police said that while the dispatcher was documenting what Kris Kirk was telling her and entering the information into a computer, he or she was not providing verbal updates to officers but forwarding notes to officers' laptops.

The dispatcher didn't provide police with a verbal update for 13 minutes.

According to NBC 9 News, the community has criticized the 12 to 13 minutes response time it took officers to arrive at the Kirks' home.

Charged: Richard Kirk has been charged with his wife's murder

However, the Denver Department of Public Safety found no wrongdoing on the part of responding officers.

In a reports, the department wrote, 'the response of the patrol officers was found to be reasonable and appropriate, given the limited information that was aired by dispatch.'

If the information had been relayed from the dispatcher to police verbally, an emergency response would have been prompted, but at the time, officers believed they were responding to a routine domestic call.

Forty-seven year-old Richard Kirk has been charged with first-degree murder. He has not yet entered a plea.

He had no prior criminal record.
