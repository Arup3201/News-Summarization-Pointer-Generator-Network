Apple products don't have the best track record when it comes to battery life, so it's no surprise the firm is said to be looking at alternative ways to power future devices - especially its iWatch.

Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases.

Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge.

Apple is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much-rumoured iWatch, concept pictured, to remove the need for wires and chargers. Reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly, while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy

Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. 

Further
 reports in September claimed Apple was struggling to make a number of 
iWatch components, meaning the release date would be pushed back. 

Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy. 

Casio,
 for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of 
watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to 
recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch.

This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise.

Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8.

All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011.

The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist.

It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.'

'An accessory device designed to be worn 
on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power 
generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the
 application continued.

Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 
detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of
 an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. 

The
 curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded
 last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery 
into future products.

Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. 

The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life.

Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8

Some analysts claimed the device was 
rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating 
Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. 

Whereas
 Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much 
about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version.

Since
 the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of 
artists have created concept images of what it may look like.

Many resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy 
Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device.

Hamilton
 took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and 
functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something
 Apple would actually produce.'

The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen.

Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch

Samsung beat Apple to the smartwatch market when it released its Android-powered Galaxy Gear, pictured, in September. However, its design, functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe Apple may have delayed its iWatch release to learn more about what customers like, and don't like
