A woman whose brother was killed by a former Power Ranger  has disputed his claims that he stabbed the man in self defense.

Ricardo Medina Jr., who played the Red Ranger, was released from jail on Tuesday after authorities said there was not enough evidence to prove he murdered his roommate, Joshua Sutter.

Instead, they said they believed Medina stabbed Sutter in self defense after the man forced his way into his room at their Palmdale, California home on Saturday afternoon.

'You have an individual here that was the victim of a beating in the kitchen area before he went to the bedroom and closed and locked the door,' Medina's attorney, Allen Bell, said.

But Sutter's sister isn't buying it.

Proof of murder? An image of Ricardo Medina Jr.'s bedroom door shows no damage, even though he claims his roommate Joshua Sutter broke in before Medina stabbed him, Sutter's sister has said

'I just don't feel he would go and attack someone that he knows could take him down,' Rachel Kennedy told ABC News.

She said that a photograph taken by a company she employed to clean up the crime scene shows Medina's undamaged bedroom door - suggesting Sutter did not force his way inside.

'I think that Josh probably opened the door trying to talk to him and I think he probably snapped,' she said, adding that she knew Sutter, 36, and Medina, 36, had been having problems.

But on Tuesday, Medina was released following three days in jail after authorities said they did not have enough evidence to prove he committed a murder.

'I want to say I'm very, very, very sorry for what occurred,' he told reporters outside the jail. 'I'm very happy to be out of jail. My heart goes out to the Sutter Family.'

His lawyer said his client's story was backed up by his girlfriend's account.

'He was not only defending himself, but a young lady who was an independent witness, who observed the entire incident,' Allen said.

Sutter was said to have been angry that Medina's girlfriend was spending too much time at their home when Medina was not there,TMZ reported.

The roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm on Saturday before Medina went into his room with his girlfriend.

Sutter then reportedly followed him and burst into the room. Medina grabbed a sword from behind his door and stabbed the man in the abdomen.

Medina called 911 and was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, while Sutter was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.   

Star: Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai (right). He has since appeared on shows including CSI
