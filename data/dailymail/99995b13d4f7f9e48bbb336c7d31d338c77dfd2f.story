The 31-year-old accused of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder after going on a devastating hit and run rampage in Cardiff has been named as Matthew Tvrdon.

An angry crowd yelled abuse at his 
police van as he arrived to appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court accused of murdering Karina Menzies, 31, who was killed when 
she was hit by a white Iveco van outside Ely Fire Station in the city on Friday.

Tvrdon, who was only named this morning, is also charged with four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving - making a total of 19 charges.

He looked relaxed as he was released from his handcuffs and brought into the courtroom at just after 10am.

Unshaven and wearing a black jumper, he was asked to confirm that he had no home address, 'Unfortunately, at the moment I was between moving out,' he told the court in a calm voice.

In a soft Cardiff accent he confirmed his date of birth as November 13, 1980, before he was remanded in custody and told he will appear at Newport Crown Court tomorrow.

Catrin Evans, prosecuting, said Tvrdon is charged with murder, 13 counts of attempted murder, four counts of actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving.

'They should be sent to the Crown Court along with the dangerous driving, which was the first incident that occurred,' she said.

She argued against granting him bail and said there had been 'concerns' about his mental health and that since his arrest he had been to the Caswell Clinic in Bridgend for psychological assessment.

More than a dozen people were injured in
 the crashes after the first incident was reported in Crossways Road, Ely, at 
3.30pm on Friday.

Two of the injured adults were left in a critical condition and five children also received treatment after the driver of the white van brought bloodshed to the streets of the Welsh capital.

Catrin Evans, head of complex casework unit for the Crown Prosecution Service, Wales said yesterday: 'With legal proceedings now under way, I would like to stress that the defendant retains the right to a fair trial.

'It is important that the criminal justice process is allowed to run its course without hindrance and I would therefore ask that nothing is placed in the public domain that may undermine this.'

Last night it was revealed that mother Karina Menzies, who saved her children from a terrifying hit-and-run rampage, suffered from a crippling disease which meant she could not save herself.

The 32-year-old managed to throw her daughters to safety before she was hit by a van and killed in an unprovoked attack on Friday.

The mother-of-three could not run away from the vehicle because her legs had been severely weakened by a progressive nerve condition.

She was one of 14 pedestrians, including seven children, hit in the 30-minute spree of horror as a driver sped through suburban streets, mowing down families on their way home from school.

Last night, Miss Menzies’ brother Craig paid tribute to his ‘hero’ sister, saying: ‘She died saving her kids.

'She’s got them out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her.

‘She would have done this instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe she’s gone.’

The tragic death of hit-and-run victim
 Karina Menzies is the second tragedy for her family - because her 
mother was strangled eight years ago.

Mother-of-five Sharon Menzies (right) was just 45 when she was killed by her boyfriend after a work romance turned sour.

Her
 family say Karina 'went off the rails for a while' after the death of 
her mum - but was getting her life back together before she was killed.

A family friend said: 'How could tragedy strike twice for a family like this? They are heartbroken.

'It really hit them hard after their mother died. Karina 
mixed with some of the wrong people, got into drugs and got into 
trouble. But she was determined to get back on track for the sake of her kids. She was doing so well and now she is gone.'

Security
 guard Brian James, 63, left his wife to move in with Sharon after a romance at the YMCA in Cardiff where both worked in 2004.

But after six weeks the relationship turned sour and Mrs Menzies asked him to leave her house.

Cardiff
 Crown Court heard James tried to make amends with wife Carol - but she 
too refused to have him back. James then went back to Mrs Menzies and 
grabbed her by the neck during a bitter row.

Mr Menzies addressed more than 200 friends and relatives who gathered yesterday to lay flowers and stage a vigil at the spot where his sister was hit.

While Miss Menzies reacted quickly to save her daughters, she could not escape the vehicle because her legs were weakened by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, friends revealed.

The condition, which damages nerves outside the spine and brain, meant she would not have been able to get away from the oncoming van fast enough.

Friend Julie Crook said: ‘Karina 
saved her kids but she couldn’t run. She had CMT and it affected her 
hands and feet. She found it really hard to run. She was very unstable 
on her feet. She wouldn’t have been able to run away. She would have 
just fallen if she tried.’

Mrs Crook insisted her friend would not have thought of herself as a hero for saving her children.

‘She was very humble,’ she added. ‘She would have said: “I did what any mother would do.”’

Police officers are investigating the theory that the driver may have deliberately targeted mothers and children because he was angry after a row with his wife.

He dumped his van and fled on foot but was arrested outside the Merrie Harrier pub in Llandough just minutes later.

There have been claims that the man reversed back over some of the people he hit and reports that he was carrying a weapon, thought to be a crook lock, which he allegedly used to batter some of those who had been knocked down.

While Miss Menzies is the only fatality, two others are in a critical condition in hospital and five children are receiving treatment.

Others hit include two schoolgirls aged 
around ten, who moments before had been browsing birthday cards in a 
shop; a mother and her son, who was riding a bike; and a couple who were
 seen on CCTV pushing their two-year-old in her pram moments before the 
van swerved across four lanes of traffic and mounted the pavement.

Murder suspect Matthew Tvrdon (right) grew up in a respectable family - but had an obsession for cars, it was revealed today.

Tvrdon is the eldest of three sons to his nurse mother Mary and Slovakian-born father Milan. Neighbours say he moved out about two years ago from his family home in a four-bed semi-detached house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Roath, Cardiff.

'He was obsessed with cars and had different cars all the time,' one neighbour said.

'He had an enormous American car at one time which took up three spaces.

'He also had a big 4x4 at one stage but he was always in different cars.'

Matthew grew up in the quiet cul-de-sac just half a mile from Cardiff magistrates court where he yesterday appeared accused of murder and 13 attempted murders.

His mother Mary, 62, and father Milan, 66, were yesterday away from their home which was being guarded by police. The couple have two other sons David, 28, and Josef, 23.

The neighbour said: 'They are a lovely family. I’ve lived her for 25 years and there have never been any problems.

'Their mum Mary is a nurse and dad Milan is very polite and lovely. He was in business but has retired.

'Mary is very caring and thoughtful and I know I could get any help from them at any time.

'I remember Matthew pushing his brother in his pram and playing football in the street outside. It is hard to believe any of this.

'I had seen him come and go in the last year and a half.

'I don’t like the word strange but it is fair to say he was different. But he was always polite and friendly.'

Other neighbours said Tvrdon was believed to have left home to move in with a woman.

One said: 'All we know is that she was a good few years older than him but he seemed very happy at the time.'
