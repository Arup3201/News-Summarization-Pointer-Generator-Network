A woman has been taken into custody after allegedly becoming enraged over a missing cell phone and setting a fire that ripped through a New York apartment, injuring four people.

The blaze was lit just after 1am Friday morning in an eighth-floor apartment in the DeWitt Clinton Houses on Lexington Ave near 109th St in East Harlem.

A 21-year-old man was taken to hospital with severe burns, smoke inhalation and cuts after breaking a window to get fresh air.

ABC reports that a one-year-old girl, a 28-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Authorities told NBC they believe the incident was the result of a dispute between the injured man and a female friend over a missing cell phone.Â 

Twitter pictures taken of the scene show a burnt and blackened window frame on the eighth floor of the building.

According to the New York Daily News, the woman poured gasoline over a pile of clothes then lit them on fire in a rage over a cell phone.

'I heard like an explosion sound - boom - and then people yelling,' neighbor Phillip Young, 15, told the New York Daily News.

Police told DNA Info that a woman has been taken into custody and is awaiting charges.

She was not among those injured in the blaze.

Neighbors saw a young woman being led out of the apartment building in handcuffs.

'The girl in cuffs was saying "sorry" in Spanish... One of the women said, "That stupid b****h set my house on fire,"' neighbor Tiffany Lawson said told the Daily News.

'Then they brought down a guy on a gurney. He was covered in really bad burns,' Lawson said.
