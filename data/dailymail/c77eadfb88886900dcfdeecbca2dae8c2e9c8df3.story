Criminally boastful: Wellington 'Jamal' Brown, 25, shared images of $100 bill stacks and designer goods on his Instagram account before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges 

Judging by accused sex trafficker Wellington Brown’s Instagram account, it is not that hard out there for a pimp after all.

Mr Brown, 25, from Hartford, Connecticut, was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on sex trafficking charges involving five underage girls.

Brown, a Jamaican citizen, and his suspected accomplice, 21-year-old Sheena Dume, were arrested by FBI in Maryland last month.

The male suspect, known to his friends as 'Jamal,' arguably has made the job easier for federal investigators thanks to his Instagram account documenting his high-flying lifestyle, complete with thick stacks of $100 bills, bottles of Dom Perignon and designer accessories, as The Smoking Gun first reported. 

The shady entrepreneur spared no detail in his frequent online postings, splashing photos of Fendi and Louis Vuitton bags, rings and watches encrusted with diamonds, sumptuous surf and turf lunches and over-the-op lobster dinners.

Many of Brown’s Instagram photos were accompanied by captions bragging about his charmed life.

'I'm way too young to be living like this but I love it,' he gushed in a post uploaded two months ago along with a snapshot of five Dom Perignon bottles resting in an ice bucket. 'I f****** love it!'

About a week before his arrest, Brown shared a photo of a money fan with the description: 'that money triple up when u get it out of state.'

Brown also may have been using his social media account as a kind of recruitment tool.

Spreading the wealth: Brown and his female accomplice are accused of pimping out five girls between the ages of 15 to 17, one of whom told the FBI that the sex traffickers kept all the money but gave them presents 

Making it too easy: Brown did nothing to hide his allegedly misbegotten wealth 

In one shot, he photographed two women is skimpy outfits touting oversize Louis Vuitton shopping bags.

The telling caption read: 'Show me loyalty and I treat u like royalty.'

On a similar note, the 25-year-old suspected pimp put up on his social media account a receipt from Louis Vuitton for more than $6,000 in purchases, writing next to it: 'Once you get the privilege to meet me your life will never be the same babygirl.'

Mr Brown's account has been dormant since his arrest July 30 in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The FBI sting also netted his alleged business partner, Ms Dume.

The two have been charged with conspiring to recruit, entice, harbor and transport the victims for sex acts from June 2013 to last February.

Lap of luxury: Judging by his social media postings, Mr Brown 25, has been a loyal customer of Louis Vuitton 

Sumptuous feast: Like most Instagram accounts, Brown's features many shots of over-the-top meals

Humble brag: The 25-year-old Jamaican citizen gushed how he was too young to lead this Dom Perignon-drenched lifestyle  

According to an arrest affidavit, the pair prostituted girls between the ages of 15 and 17, who were given monikers like Chocolate, China, Delicious and Desire

One of the victims told FBI agents that she was recruited by Brown straight out of high school.

The teenager said Brown and Dume would routinely take the girls' personal property when they would go to meet johns to make sure they will return with the money.

The teenage prostitute also revealed that the 25-year-old never paid her or the other young women money, but instead bought them presents and took them to beauty salons.

The charges against Brown and Dume carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and up to life in prison.
