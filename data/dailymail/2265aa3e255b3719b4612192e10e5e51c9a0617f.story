Space probes have found a hitherto unknown third Van Allen radiation belt around Earth, which could help them understand how and when solar storms will wreak havoc on Earth.

The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet.

They can often swell dramatically in response to solar storms and other space weather, posing serious dangers to communications and GPS satellites, as well as humans in space.

It was previously believed there were two Van Allen belts, but particle detection instruments aboard twin probes launched last summer have revealed the existence of a third, transient radiation belt.

Scientists were able to observe the formation of the third belt, which persisted for four weeks before a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the Sun annihilated it.

'After decades of studying the radiation belts, this was a completely new phenomenon,' said Harlan Spence of the University of New Hampshire, who is part of the team which operates the probes.

'With the Van Allen Probes' instruments we now have the "eyes" capable of seeing such remarkable phenomena.

'We look forward eagerly to the rest of the mission in order to establish how often such extreme radiation belt structures and dynamics may occur.'

The Van Allen belts were the first major discovery of the Space Age.

Data sent back from NASA's Pioneer 3 and Explorer IV spacecraft, both launched in 1958 and both carrying instruments built by James Van Allen, showed the presence of two distinct rings of high-energy electrons.

At the time of their discovery, they were thought to be relatively stable structures, but subsequent observations have shown they are in fact dynamic and mysterious.

On August 30 last year, NASA launched the Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission, later renamed the Van Allen Probes mission, to learn more about the belts.

They are known to be hazardous to satellites, astronauts and technological systems on Earth, so increasing our understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space-based technology.

A better understanding of belt formation, including the number of belts, will also help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on Earth.

The discovery of the third belt came somewhat serendipitously, however, as the instrument which spotted it, the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT), was turned on earlier than originally planned.

'It was a lucky decision,' Nasa said in a release. 'Shortly before REPT turned on, solar activity on the sun had sent energy toward Earth that caused the radiation belts to swell.'

The data sent back to Earth from the REPT instruments during the month of September initially showed two Van Allen belts, as expected.

But after a few days, the outer ring appeared to compress into an intense, tightly packed electron band and a third, less compact belt of electrons formed further out, creating a total of three rings.

'By the fifth day REPT was on, we could plot out our observations and watch the formation of a third radiation belt,' said Shri Kanekal, deputy mission scientist for the Van Allen Probes.

'We started wondering if there was something wrong with our instruments. We checked everything, but there was nothing wrong with them. The third belt persisted beautifully, day after day, week after week, for four weeks.'

Energetic electron data gathered by the probes: It shows three discrete energy channels. The third belt region and second slot are highlighted, and exist until a coronal mass ejection destroys them on October 1

Dan Baker of the University of Colorado at Boulder, whose lab designed and built REPT, added: 'It was so odd looking, I thought there must be something wrong with the instrument.

'But we saw things identically on each of the spacecraft. We had to come to the conclusion that this was real.'

Harlan Spence, an astrophysicist at the University of New Hampshire, principal investigator for the Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma instrument suite, of which REPT is a part, said it was a eureka moment.

'We watched in amazement as the outer radiation belt disappeared rapidly, but not completely; a small sliver of very energetic electrons remained at its inner edge, which we dubbed the "storage ring",' he said.

'When the main outer electron belt reformed over subsequent days, it did so at a greater distance than where the storage ring was located, thus creating the transient, three-belt structure.

'The textbook was being rewritten right before our eyes.'

Solar flare: On August 31 a giant prominence on the Sun erupted, sending out particles and a shock wave that traveled near Earth. This event may have been one of the causes of the third radiation belt

The middle 'storage ring' persisted as the belt furthest away from Earth began to decay away in the third week of September, until, finally, a powerful interplanetary shockwave traveling from the sun virtually annihilated both the storage ring and the rest of the outer belt.

Scientists have known that the outer Van Allen belt can fluctuate wildly, at times swelling with charged particles before letting them slip away again, depending on space weather.

However, this type of dynamic three-belt structure has never been seen before, or even theoretically considered.

In the months since the storage belt and the outer belt virtually disappeared, the Van Allen radiation zones have re-formed into the originally expected two-belt structure.

'We have no idea how often this sort of thing happens,' said Professor Baker. 'This may occur fairly frequently but we didn't have the tools to see it.'

He added: 'This is the first time we have had such high-resolution instruments look at time, space and energy together in the outer belt.

'Previous observations of the outer radiation belt only resolved it as a single blurry element. When we turned REPT on just two days after launch, a powerful electron acceleration event was already in progress, and we clearly saw the new belt and new slot between it and the outer belt.'

Danger: The Van Allen belts known to be hazardous to satellites, astronauts and technological systems on Earth, so increasing understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space-based technology

The Van Allen Probes are two identical spacecraft with a mission to map out the radiation belts, cataloguing the wide range of energies and particles, and tracking the zoo of magnetic waves that pulse through the area.

The two probes, which are flying around Earth in an elliptical orbit, are able to send back observations for the first time from the heart of the two belts as each probe passes through.

Each carries an identical set of five instrument suites that allow scientists to gather data on the belts in unprecedented detail.

The information sent back by the twin, octagonal spacecraft will help researchers better understand how space weather affects near-Earth phenomena by interacting with, feeding and stripping away the Van Allen belts.

A better understanding of belt formation, including the number of belts, will help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on Earth.

'These events we've recorded are extraordinary and are already allowing us to refine and confirm our theories of belt dynamics in a way that will lead to predictability of their behavior,' said Professor Spence.

'[That's] important for understanding space weather and ultimately for the safety of astronauts and spacecraft that operate within such a hazardous region of geospace.'

The scientists detailed their findings in a paper published yesterday in the journal Science.Â
