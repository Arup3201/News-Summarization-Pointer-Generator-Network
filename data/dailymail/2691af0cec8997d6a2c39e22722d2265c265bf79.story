Four drunken holidaymakers have been forced to write grovelling apology letters to the people of Newquay after being caught throwing empty alcohol bottles into the sea.

Residents in the Cornwall resort watched from their windows as the gang, who had come to the town for the Boardmasters festival, lurched drunkenly and cheered as they hurled bottles from the cliff top at the Lusty Glaze beauty spot.

Furious calls went through to the police and Sergeant Regie Butler caught up with the gang, in their early twenties, who were lurching unsteadily back to their holiday campsite.

He said 'I decided there and then to make them write letters of apology to the residents.

'What they did was just idiotic and unbelievable, really.

'They thought it would be fun and hadn't even thought of the possible consequences.

'So we were sat there thinking what we could do them for, and checked to see if anything had landed on the beach, because if it had we could have got them to clean the beach.

'We found bottles out in the sea, so it was a minor offence for littering.

'We thought the most appropriate thing would be for the lads to write letters of apology.

'So we sent them away with the bits of paper and told them to drop them into the police station by 3pm the next day, which they did.

'We told them we'd be out hunting for them if they didn't.'

Grovelling: Sergeant Regie Butler decided to ask the drunken holidaymakers to write apology letters

'Inconsiderate behaviour': One letter writer claimed to be dearly sorry for disturbing the peace

One letter read: 'I am sorry for all of our actions and it was also very inconsiderate, we will be sure to never act so stupid again and I regret what happened.'

Another said 'To whom this may concern, I am extremely sorry the incident occoured (sic). It was just a moment of madness.'

A third man wrote 'All apologies go to all residents around the area for disturbing them.'

One acknowledged that he would not have committed the offence in his own local area.

'It is something I would not have done in my own town and I am genuinely deeply sorry for bottles being thrown in the sea while sitting on the local cliffs,' he said.

Apologies: One letter writer even thanks the police for being 'polite' and 'genuine' when speaking to him

Sergeant Butler said he stressed to them the dangers of what they'd done.

'Actions like this can have a huge impact. In the first instance it's ruining the coast, which is a beautiful part of the world where we don't want rubbish,' he said.

'Secondly, there's the danger side, when the bottles wash up and people can tread on them and suffer serious injury.

'Then there is the danger to the marine wildlife.

'Hopefully it made them think about everything we told them and will have had more of an impact than anything else we could have done.'

Newquay has already issued a warning that parents who give their children alcohol will be named and shamed

Newquay has already issued a summer season warning that parents who fuel their youngsters with booze for a 'no holds barred' holiday in the resort will be named and shamed.

The Newquay Safe campaign group says naming and shaming could stop what they call 'parent dealing' where mums and dads are happy to let their offspring have alcohol for summer breaks.

Rob Andrew, from Newquay Safe, said that existing laws might not be adequate for dealing with parents who supply children with large amounts of alcohol before sending them on holiday.

Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Hogg said: 'Parental buying is a problem, but you have to give credit to retailers,
 they can detect this sort of buying and try and prevent it.'

'We
 believe we now have evidence that the 24-hour licensing actually 
enables pre-loading.

'There's now a feeling that you can drink as long as
 you want. It allows you to purchase cheap booze, go home, and get 
tanked up. Then you know you have plenty more time in the night to enjoy
 drinking.

'For
 me it's a no-brainer to try and limit some of this licensing during the
 night. It's not working, 24-hour licensing has enabled a mentality of 
pre-loading.'

'We
 are seventh in the league table of 43 policing areas on violent crime, 
we are fourth on rape, and we have been searching for the reasons behind
 this and we have come down heavily on the issue of misuse of alcohol.'
