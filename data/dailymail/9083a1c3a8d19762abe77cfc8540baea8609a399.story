Soaring numbers of students are smoking shishas - but experts are warning that the Middle Eastern water pipe is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.

A study carried out by University of California San Francisco has found that whilst smoking a shisha exposes you to different chemicals, they are still harmful.

Research chemist Peyton Jacob said: 
‘People want to know if it is a lesser health risk if they switch from 
cigarettes to smoking a water-pipe on a daily basis. 

'We found that 
water-pipe smoking is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking, nor 
is it likely to be an effective harm-reduction strategy.’

Trendy: Enjoying a fruit-flavoured shisha has become very popular with students

By measuring the levels of toxins in the blood, breath and urine after smoking, scientists found that those who smoked shisha exposed themselves to high levels of carbon monoxide - especially dangerous to those who suffer with heart or lung problems -  and benzene, which has strong links to leukaemia.

The amount of bars and cafes offering the exotic pipe have rocketed in in recent years, with the number of people enjoying a smoking session increasing by 210 per cent in just half a decade.

Smoking shisha is 
common in many Middle Eastern countries and is growing in popularity in the UK and U.S. in particular.

But
a 2009 survey found that almost a third of university students had 
smoked tobacco from a water-pipe on at least one occasion, with its use being disproportionately popular among white students, males, and 
fraternity and sorority members.

Last year the World Health Organisation warned that a one-hour shisha session can be as harmful as smoking 100 cigarettes.

A cigarette smoker typically takes between eight and 12 puffs, inhaling 0.5 to 0.6 litres of smoke. But during a typical hour-long shisha session, smokers may take up to 200 drags, ranging from 0.15 to 1 litre of smoke each.

Tradition: Shisha has been enjoyed for generations in the Middle East

The new study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, followed eight men and five women, all of whom had smoked both cigarettes and shisha in the past.  

Individuals vary in how their bodies metabolize and excrete toxic substances, so for the most accurate results, the researchers had the same person smoke cigarettes and a water-pipe on different days.

The volunteers then smoked an average of three water-pipe sessions or 11 cigarettes per day.

The results found that a benzene 
byproduct doubled in the urine of volunteers after using a shisha in 
comparison to after smoking cigarettes.

Occupational exposure to benzene
has been shown to increase the risk of developing leukemia.

Furthermore, the researchers measured carbon monoxide in the breath over 24 hours and found levels 2.5 higher after water-pipe use in comparison to cigarette smoking.

Contrary to the idea that shisha is purer or less toxic than cigarettes, Neal
Benowitz, a tobacco researcher who carry out the study, said: ‘You’re 
basically burning a charcoal briquette on top of the tobacco. And most 
of what you’re smoking is a moist fruit preparation, which is mixed with
the tobacco. It smells good and it tastes good.’

The American study has shown that shisha is no less damaging than smoking

However, Jacob added: ‘In addition to delivering toxic substances from the charcoal and tobacco, the heat causes chemical reactions which produce toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some PAHs are highly carcinogenic and can cause lung cancer.’

And compared to non-smokers, Benowitz said: ‘If you are smoking shisha daily, you are likely to be at increased risk for cancer.’

The good news is that shisha is less addictive because it contains lower levels of nicotine.

Among those not yet addicted, the most common pattern of shisha use in the United States – about once per week – is not likely to cause addiction, Benowitz said.
