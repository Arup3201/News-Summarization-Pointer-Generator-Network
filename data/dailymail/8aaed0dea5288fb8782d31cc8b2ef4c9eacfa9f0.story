Walmart has been fined $82 million for failing to deal with hazardous waste in two US states.

The retail giant pleaded guilty to seven counts of violating environmental laws in California and Missouri, ending a ten-year legal battle.

Authorities discovered that Walmart staff disposed products such as bleach and fertiliser by pouring it out in the sink or throwing it in the bin.

Down the drain: Wal-Mart has been fined $82million for violating environmental laws when not properly disposing of hazardous waste

The retailer was charged with six 
counts of violating the Clean Water Act in California and one count of 
violating a federal law related to pesticide disposal in Missouri.

However the $82million fine is not set to make a massive hole in Walmart's pocket as the company made  $128 billion 
in revenues last year.

The problems began in 2003 when the 
improper waste disposal procedures were uncovered and a new education 
programme was put in to place in 2006 urging staff to use chemical bags 
for items such as bleach or nail polish.

‘Retailers like Walmart that generate 
hazardous waste have a duty to legally and safely dispose of that 
hazardous waste, and dumping it down the sink was neither legal nor 
safe,’ André Birotte Jr., the United States attorney for the Central 
District of California, told the New York Times.

Walmart ‘put the public and the 
environment at risk and gained an unfair economic advantage over other 
companies,’ Ignacia Moreno, assistant attorney general for the 
Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division in Missouri, said in a statement.

The retailer pleaded guilty to all charges, but noted in a 
statement that the firm has not been accused of any specific 
environmental damage as a result of the way staff disposed hazardous 
material.

Walmart has now revised its disposal 
rules and is training staff to properly get rid of hazardous waste, 
spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan told the New York Times.

 ‘Once we learned of these 
allegations, we looked into it, investigated it, and decided to put this
program in place, so they know if something is determined as hazardous 
waste.’

Walmart has already settled twice with
California and Missouri in 2010 and 2012 on the same charges, with the 
total fines paid now tallying up to $110 million.

Walmart stores is the world’s third largest public corporation and is the biggest private employer in the world.

It was founded in 1962 and has 8,500 stores wordwide, including Asda in the United Kingdom.
