Jan Vertonghen insists he will not go cap in hand to Tottenham for a new contract, but instead wait for the club to 'take the first step'.

The Belgian's current deal doesn't expire until 2018 - but discussions over an improved contract started earlier this year before being shelved.

And Vertonghen says he will not go crawling to the club to re-open talks.

'We are not talking about a new contract. The club has to  take the first step,' he said.

'We are now in a busy period, with a lot of games. Talks are often held in periods where there are less games.'

Vertonghen has nurtured a reputation as one of the Premier League's best defenders since his arrival from Ajax in 2012.

However, he had endured an inconsistent start to this season.

He's been left out of Mauricio Pochettino's starting XI at various junctures, leading to question marks being raised over his future at White Hart Lane.

However, Vertonghen insists he feels comfortable with his role under Pochettino.

'I'm not focused on a transfer. I really like it over here, he said.

'I have the feeling that, when everyone's fit, I have my place in the team and I also feel I understand better what the manager expects from me.

'It's getting better and better with the team. Our start was difficult. A new manager, lots of first team players at the World Cup. But I feel we understand what he wants now.

'That I play less games than last season is not a problem. The manager wants to keep everyone fit, also with the Europa League campaign. No problem for me.

'But I feel a regular, even when everyone's fit.'
