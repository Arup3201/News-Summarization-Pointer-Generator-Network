David Beckham has hailed new Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney as the ‘most respected player in the England team’ and says leading his country will be the greatest honour he’ll ever have in football.

Beckham, who skippered England on 59 occasions to become the country’s most iconic football captain since Bobby Moore, gave his blessing of the changing of the guard from Steve Gerrard to Rooney on a visit to The FA’s training base at St George’s Park.

Ahead of England’s first Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday, Beckham said: ‘It’s no surprise to me at all that Wayne has been made captain. He is one of the most experienced players in the team and the most respected player in the team.

‘Young players will look up to him for inspiration; he’s a player who wears his heart on his sleeve.

‘People want to see that passion; you fight for every ball and celebrate every goal you score, or every goal you set up. That’s what Wayne’s all about. Wayne’ s such a great talent, such a great player, people love him, fans love him and it’s great to see him with the armband. It’s something I know he’ll cherish.’

Beckham played with a young Rooney at Euro 2004 and advises the Manchester United striker to enjoy being England captain, admitting it’s the thing he misses most since retiring from football.

The former United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star, who was capped 115 times by England and was at one time the most famous sportsman on the planet, said: ‘Being captain means more in England than any other country. You really know how important it is when you are part of the squad.

‘As a kid I was a Manchester United fan but my dream like like every kid was to play for England.

‘I got the opportunity and to be captain 59 times was incredible. When I look back at my career since retiring, playing for England was the thing I’ve really missed. It was my proudest moment to get the armband.’

Beckham, now 39, popped into St George’s Park on a family trip at the weekend and admitted he was stunned by the facilities to all England squads, from women’ s and junior teams to the senior side under Roy Hodgson.

‘It is really amazing, I’m so impressed, ‘ he said. ‘It’s peaceful, and you can feel it respects the history of our game even though this particular facility has only been open for two years.

‘It’s nice to hear rooms are named after certain players and the fans have voted for like the ‘Paul Gascoigne Room’ or the ‘Bobby Moore Room’. It’s special.

‘Obviously we always played on nice pitches, but to have pitch like this to train on every day is incredible. I’ve not been to many facilities around the world as good as this.

“For our players, it’s place where you can rest and prepare. It’s great for young players to come and aspire to be great England players in the future.’

What's next? Beckham, ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids, has not ruled out a management career

Beckham is busy trying to build a new MLS franchise in Miami but hasn’t ruled out trying to coach one day in the future.

‘At the moment I am happy doing what I am doing, but you never know, in a few years I might change my mind,’ he said.

‘It is great for coaches to get the chance to come to St George’s and do their qualifications. For young coaches, it is a chance to become Premier League and England managers of the future.
