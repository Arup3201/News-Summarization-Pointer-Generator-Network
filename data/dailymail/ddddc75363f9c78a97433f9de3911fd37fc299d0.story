David Cameron was the butt of jokes around the world yesterday for the ridiculous photo he tweeted of himself looking serious on the phone to Barack Obama.

Where Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart had already boldly gone in mocking the Prime Minister’s attempt to look statesmanlike, countless others followed.

Sir Patrick had tweeted a picture of himself holding a tub of Wet Ones instead of a phone and saying: ‘I’m now patched in as well. Sorry for the delay.’

David Cameron posted this picture of himself online on Wednesday with the caption: ¿I¿ve been speaking to @BarackObama about the  situation in Ukraine. We are united in  condemnation of Russia¿s actions'

Twitter users then flooded the site with images of themselves holding random objects to their ear.

They included bananas, air fresheners, Lego characters, toy animals and a variety of household objects.

Mr Cameron had tweeted his picture on Wednesday evening, writing: ‘I’ve been speaking to @BarackObama about the  situation in Ukraine. We are united in  condemnation of Russia’s actions.’

Now the joke has gone viral - with Twitter users across the world joining in on the fun

This picture of Putin with an ostrich was also posted online as part of the craze as was a dog on a phone

Sir Patrick followed with his tweet  before Twitter user Michael Moreno held  up a dog to his ear and tweeted: ‘Ok, guys, thanks for holding.’

The teasing from British actor Sir Patrick, 73, prompted the Prime Minister into a good-humoured response yesterday.

He posted a second photo, this time  showing him meeting Bill Clinton in  Downing Street, with a tweet to Sir Patrick saying: ‘Talking to another US President, this time face to face, not on the phone.’

US  comic Rob Delaney soon 
posted a picture  of himself holding a toothpaste tube and telling Mr 
Obama and Mr Cameron: ‘Hi  guys, I’m on the line now too. Get me up  to 
speed.’
