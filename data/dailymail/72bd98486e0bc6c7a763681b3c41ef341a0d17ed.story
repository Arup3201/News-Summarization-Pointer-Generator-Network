Margaret Thatcher promoted male MPs based on whether they were good-looking or not, a former minister said yesterday.

Jonathan Aitken, who published a biography of the former Prime Minister last year, said she as a ‘surprisingly insecure’ woman who was ‘very influenced by male good looks’.

He claimed that the fact that men like Cecil Parkinson - who he said was attractive - did so well in her Cabinet proved his thesis to be true.

Preference: Mr Aitken said attractive men like Cecil Parkinson (left) and John Moore (right) 'made it'

The former MP, who went out with Baroness Thatcher’s daughter Carol for three years, said she also preferred better-looking foreign leaders, such as Francois Mitterand.

Mr Aitken told the Independent Bath Literature Festival: ‘If you look closely at some of her promotions in the Cabinet there are quite a few who made it because they were good-looking.

'Cecil Parkinson was one. John Moore. Humphrey Atkins. She liked handsome men.’ 

Lord Parkinson served as Tory chairman and Trade Secretary before being forced to resign after a sex scandal.

Jonathan Aitken said his failed three-year relationship with Mrs Thatcher's daughter Carol meant he did not benefit from the Tory leader's policy

Despite this, she brought him back in 1987 as Energy and then Transport Secretary.

Mr Moore was a former Health Secretary once seen as a future leader.

Mr Atkinson was Northern Ireland Secretary.

Baroness Thatcher’s eye also influenced her foreign policy, said Mr Aitken.

‘She did not like the reptilian [former French President] Giscard d’Estaing but she liked François Mitterrand, who looked like a film star,’ he said.

Similarly, her relationship with Ronald Reagan was helped by his appearance.

Asked why he had not benefited from 
Baroness Thatcher’s policy himself, Mr Aitken cited his failed 
three-year relationship with Carol Thatcher.

It was not, he said, his ‘greatest career move’ to date the Prime Minister’s daughter.

‘But when you’re young you make all kinds
 of mistakes,’ he said. ‘She was definitely angry with me for quite a 
long time. But I was also far too cocky for my own good.’

Mr Aitken said that his book, Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality, covers the period when ‘she goes off the rails’ after her resignation.

He described the leader as bullying, insufferably rude, hubristic and a bigot who never recovered from leaving 10 Downing Street.

‘She remained pretty bitter for the rest of her life,’ he added.
