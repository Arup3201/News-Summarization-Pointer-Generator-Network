A single dose of ecstasy can reset the drug user’s internal clock and cause weeks of interrupted sleep, a new study claims.

Researchers at Monash University in Australia report that the drug is a stimulant, and causes users to lose their ability to sleep peacefully and resets the body’s internal clock.

Dr Ogeil said the drug – often taken in pill or powder form – leaves ‘lasting effects and that the body clock is involved.’

Sleepless nights? A new study claims that using ecstasy only once or twice can reset the body's internal clock at the wrong time

The study, published in a recent issue of Psychopharmacology, springboards on past research endeavours that have found up to 70 per cent of ecstasy users reported sleep disturbance.

Dr Ogeil said that most ecstasy users partake of the drug recreationally. ‘They take one or two pills once a month or less,’ he said.

In his study – the first of its kind, ABC Science in Australia notes – Dr Ogeil and his colleagues injected 72 lab rats with the equivalence of one to doses of MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy.

The scientists then examined the effect of the drug on the rat’s ‘internal clocks’ – the parts of the body that regulate sleep.

Sleepless nights: Researchers said those taking MDMA sometimes reported weeks of restless nights

Researchers found that ecstasy in their systems modified two specific genes – the Per1 and Per2.

 MDMA, also known as 3,4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine is a psychoactive drug that releases serotonin in the brain – the chemical that is responsible for affecting mood, sexual activity, and sensitivity to pain.

Often taken in pill, capsule, or tablet, MDMA evokes feelings of euphoria, intense feelings of love and emotional warmth, and an increase in tactile sensitivity.

However, the drug can also produce confusion, depression, and sleep problems. Other symptoms include nausea, blurred vision, chills, sweating, and teeth clenching.

Dehydration is a serious risk to those who have taken the drug.

Both are directly involved in maintaining the body’s natural cadence, including sleep cycles.

Dr Ogeil said: ‘MDMA was able to induce these genes, or turn them on when they should be off.’

While external factors such as light and caffeine constantly keep internal clocks in flux, Dr Ogeil noted that taking ecstasy resets the body’s natural rhythm at the wrong time.

He said that some users suffer from irregular sleep or poor quality of sleep for months after they take MDMA.

In another study published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, Dr Ogeil and his team of researchers looked into how taking ecstasy disturbed sleep patterns.

The study asked for the help from flatmates and partners in monitoring the sleep patterns. Most reported obnoxious snoring and leg twitching.

Both, Dr Ogeil said, ecstasy users may not be aware of.

In another report by Frédéric N. Brière, from the Université of Montréal, the study found that teens who used methamphetamine and MDMA were more likely to show depressive symptoms in the future.
