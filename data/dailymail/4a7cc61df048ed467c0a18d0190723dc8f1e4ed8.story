Christian Benteke made a scoring return to action after six months out by converting a penalty as Aston Villa’s Under 21 side beat Bolton.

The Belgium striker completed 63 minutes in a match for the first time since he ruptured his achilles on April 3.

He was named from the start by coach Gordon Cowans with manager Paul Lambert keen to witness his star player in action before Manchester City visit Villa Park on Saturday.

Benteke sent Ross Fitzsimons the wrong way from the spot in the 33rd minute to mark his comeback with a goal and then set up Jores Okore for a shot that was saved two minutes after the interval.

The 23-year-old was replaced by Thomas Strain just after the hour and could be set for a place in Lambert’s squad for City.

Joe Cole boosted his selection chances with a curling effort in the 56th minute to make it 2-0 and Strain added a third seven minutes from time.

After the match, Lambert said: 'Christian played for about an hour today (Monday) and we’ re delighted with how he came through the game. It was great to see him back out there and he played well in the time he was on the pitch.

'He scored a goal, which is great for him, and his general play was good, too, considering how long he’s been away from it.

'We’ll see how he feels tomorrow and how he recovers but it was a good, positive step for him today. It will have given him a lift to get out there and play and score a goal and that’s great for him.’

Lambert will be glad to have his top striker back despite their impressive start to the league campaign

Speaking ahead of the defeat by Chelsea at the weekend, the Villa boss said of Benteke: 'He's getting closer. Next week we will see how he is for the Man City game. I'm not saying he'll start, or anything, but he's certainly getting close.

'The injury is totally fine, I'm not worried about that. He's taken a couple of little kicks in training and has come through them. He's an athlete.

'It's just his lack of practice. You've got to watch he doesn't break down after too much too soon.

'Everybody is happy to see him come back. It's been a long road for him after he missed the World Cup. Him coming back has been great. It will give everyone a lift, supporters included.’
