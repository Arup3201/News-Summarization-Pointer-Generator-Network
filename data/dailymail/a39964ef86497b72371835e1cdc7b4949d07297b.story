Cristiano Ronaldo has apologised to Cordoba defender Edimar for the kick that saw the Portuguese sent-off for the ninth time in his career on Saturday.

The three-time World Player of the Year kicked out in frustration at Edimar in the 83rd minute but he was bailed out by Gareth Bale's last-gasp penalty.

Afterwards he tweeted: 'I apologise to everyone and especially Edimar for my thoughtless action in today's game.'

It was a miserable afternoon for Ronaldo in which he was overshadowed by former Manchester United winger Bebe for much of the game.

His frustration got the better of him in the second half but when he was given his marching orders for kicking Edimar and striking Jose Angel Crespo it meant Bale was allowed to take both free-kicks and penalties. He won a spot-kick with a free-kick that was handled by Fede Cartabia - who was also subsequently sent off - and he stepped up in Ronaldo’s place to score from the spot.

Ronaldo could face a three-match ban for violent conduct but Bale looks more than capable of picking up the baton. The former Tottenham winger ended up deciding the match but for a long time it seemed another winger might grab the headlines.

It was five years ago that Sir Alex Ferguson signed 19-year-old Bebe from Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal without having seen play. Many hoped he would be the next Ronaldo signed three years earlier from Sporting aged 18 but beyond nationality and position there turned out to be few similarities.

Bebe played seven games for United and four for Besiktas on loan before heading back to Portugal to rebuld his career on loan first at Rio Ave and then at Pazos Ferreira. It looked as if he’d bounced back when he signed permanently for Benfica in the summer but after one appearance he was sent out on loan again, this time to Cordoba who were 14th in La Liga going into this weekend’s fixtures.

He was back on the same pitch as Ronaldo and in the battle of the former Manchester United wingers Bebe was winning hands down at the end of the first half. He crucially won the spot-kick that gave Cordoba the lead.

His shot from the right smashed against Sergio Ramos and referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez gave a penalty and booked the Real Madrid defender. After a slow, straight run-up Nabi Ghilas beat Iker Casillas for his sixth goal of the season.

Bebe had only just started, however. He raced away down the Cordoba right and crossed for Florin Andone but his centre was just behind the Romanian striker.

He burned up Marcelo again only to his time over-hit his cross, sending it behind the goal. The quality of the final ball left a lot to be desired but the threat was most definitely there with a pace, power and purpose missing in most of Real Madrid’s lethargic attacking play.

Bebe’s next effort was a shot that shaved Casillas’ far post and he then tried his luck from distance with the keeper this time making the save. Ronaldo finally responded with a free-kick at the other end but the set-piece was high and wild never troubling Juan Carlos in the home side’s goal.

As players from both teams prepare for a set piece, Ronaldo has other, more violent, ideas on his mind

When Real Madrid finally got back into the game it was the other two parts of their front-three that produced the goal. Karim Benzema turning in James Rodriguez's corner after Gareth Bale had flicked the kick on.

There was no sign of any Cordoba players looking for shirt swaps when the half-time whistle went. Much had been made before the game of striker Andone admitting – like Cambridge United’s players – that Cordoba would have to pay to replace any shirts they swapped with Madrid.

The home side had shown the visitors no deference in the first half. Madrid had not played at Cordoba’s stadium in 43 years but Real’s record here has never been great, losing one and drawing four of the eight games played. Now they were at 1-1 at half time struggling to look anything like league leaders.

It had been such a trying first half that Carlo Ancelotti had finished it arguing with the fourth official. He sent the same players out for the second half but there was no real change in the pattern of the game and Bebe continued his one man show with the winger going on another mazy run only to disappoint with a weak shot. Ronaldo had the chance to respond from another free-kick at the other end but again his range was off.

On minute 68 Cordoba should have taken the lead when Varane dithered with a header back to Casillas that Andone intercepted and headed over the goalkeeper. Time seemed to standstill in the Nuevo Archangel as the ball looped goalwards only to come back off the bar.

With the clock ticking down Ronaldo stung Juan Carlos’ hands from distance with a long shot and he then saved a Benzema shot from the edge of the area. Ramos headed the resulting corner over the bar as Ronaldo swung wildly at Crespo and was lucky the referee never saw the swipe. When he did it again moments later everyone saw it.

Another corner came over from the right and he caught Crespo again and was shown a straight red. It was not the last red of the match though.

Cartabia was sent off for a second yellow when he handballed Bale’s free-kick and, in Ronaldo’s absence, the Welshman scored from the spot to give Real Madrid the points.
