The Taliban beheaded 17 people in a remote corner of southern Afghanistan – apparently for attending a party.

Two of the victims were women and all were described as ‘civilians’.

Local officials said they were killed because they were at a music event, were dancing and both sexes were present, all of which are against Taliban law.

However, other reports claimed that 
those who died – who may have been shot before being decapitated – were 
victims of a crackdown on government informers, or even that they were 
killed as a result of two Taliban leaders arguing over the women.

The executions were carried out on Sunday night in Helmand province’s Musa Qala district in an area controlled by the Taliban.

District government chief 
Neyamatullah Khan said the victims were part of a large group that had 
gathered for a celebration involving music and dancing.

He said the Taliban slaughtered them 
to show their disapproval of the event and added that information was 
trickling out only slowly because the area is completely under the 
Taliban’s control.

However, his version was disputed by a
Helmand police official who said there was a possibility that those who
were killed were suspected of being informants.

Yet another offical put the killings 
down to a dispute between two Taliban leaders. Afghan President Hamid 
Karzai condemned the atrocity and said the killings were against Sharia 
law.

‘The killing of innocent civilians by the Taliban is an unforgivable crime,’ he said.

Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan is an area said to be completely
under the control of insurgents

However, the Taliban denied that they were involved.

Spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said: 
‘No Taliban have killed any civilians. Neither were Taliban commanders 
fighting each other. We don’t know about this thing. Whether it happened
or not, we were not involved.’

The deaths contradict the Taliban 
leadership’s orders for their fighters to avoid killing ordinary 
Afghans, suggesting a breakdown in discipline and a further fracturing 
of the insurgency.

Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar 
urged his commanders earlier this month to ‘employ tactics that do not 
cause harm to the life and property of the common countrymen’.

The insurgents’ supreme leader has 
issued such edicts from hiding before, perhaps trying to soften the 
extremist movement’s image, but the order appears to have been widely 
ignored.

A UN report last month said 1,145 
civilians were killed and 1,954 others were injured in the first half of
the year, 80 per cent of them by militants.

In fact, while the Taliban seek to 
soften their image, the beheadings recall the days of public executions 
during their rule in the five years before the US-led invasion in 
October 2001.

British soldiers are seen on patrol in Musa Qala in 2007. In a separate incident 10 Afghan soldiers were killed and two Nato troops shot dead in what has been described as an 'insider attack'

The deaths heralded a violent 24 
hours in Afghanistan. More than 200 insurgents took part in an attack on
a checkpoint in the same region yesterday in which ten Afghan soldiers 
were killed and six more seized.

There are fears that the Taliban will
again control southern Afghanistan and impose their strict 
interpretation of Islamic law on the region as foreign troops gradually 
withdraw in the next two years.

Nearly all foreign troops are to 
leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and the US-led Nato coalition hopes
that Afghan security forces will be strong enough to take control. As 
the drawdown progresses, there has been a surge in attacks by Afghan 
forces against their allies.

An Afghan soldier killed two US 
troops in eastern Afghanistan’s Laghman province yesterday, bringing to 
12 the number of foreign soldiers who have died this month.

The Afghan soldier is said to have 
used a rocket-propelled grenade and was himself killed as he fled by 
forces called in by the Americans to help deal with an attack by 
insurgents.

The chief spokesman for Nato forces in
Afghanistan said coalition forces were not pulling back from 
collaborating with the Afghans despite such incidents.
