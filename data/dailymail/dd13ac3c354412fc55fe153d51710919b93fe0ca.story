A couple were told that their five children could be taken away by social services – because the father left their two-year-old alone in a car for just five minutes.

Julie and Tim Haines came within a 'hair's breadth' of losing their children after he left their daughter while he popped in to buy Calpol at a chemist's.

Mr Haines, 50, returned to be confronted by two police officers who told him he should not have left his toddler in the car.

The Haines family were nearly torn apart after Tim left his two-year-old daughter Iset (second right) now 11, in the car for less than ten minutes in 2004. Also pictured, his wife Julie and his daughter Kiya, 13 (second left) 

The family law advocate was subsequently charged with child neglect and his five children placed on a protection register.

His wife Julie lost her job as head of music at a private school in Worcester as a result of the proceedings. 

And the couple spent a year fighting to lift the threat of having the children removed by social services – in what they now describe as a 'life-changing and horrible experience'. 

Mrs Haines said: 'We won, but we came within a hair's breadth of losing our children.

A few weeks after the incident officers came to Mr Haines' house to arrest him for 'wilful exposure of a child to risk of significant harm'. His five children, pictured, were put on the child protection register

'We are a respectable middle-class family. It makes you think, if this can happen to us, what child is safe? This could happen to anyone. It has been a nightmare I've struggled to shake off for the past ten years of my life.'

The family decided to speak out following the case of Birmingham mother Joan, who was given a criminal record for 'child cruelty' after leaving her six-year-old son alone at home for 45 minutes.

The Government is facing calls to pass new laws that will clarify how long children can be left unattended before parents are prosecuted for neglect. Earlier this month John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, tabled a Parliamentary question seeking clarity.

He said yesterday: 'State intervention is actually doing a lot of harm and it might be doing some good as well, but sometimes it's hard to see the good in all the harm. Every family should be interested in this as it could happen to anyone.'

When Mr Haines parked on Evesham High Street in Worcestershire back in October 2004, he could not have imagined the 'nightmare' that was to follow. Returning from the school run, he remembered that the family had run out of children's medicine Calpol.

Iset's father left her in the car seat, but said he could 'keep an eye on her from the chemist' 

He made the snap decision to leave his youngest daughter Iset in her car seat while he went to the chemist's – because he could 'keep an eye on her' from the shop as he queued. When he returned to his car, he was confronted by police.

He said: 'I thought that was the end of it but a few weeks later they showed up at my house, arrested me and sent social workers in to search my house.'

Mr Haines was prosecuted for 'wilful exposure of a child to risk of significant harm' and all the couple's children – who are now aged 11, 13, 14, 20 and 22 – were placed on the child protection register.

It took the family nearly a year to have their children's names removed from the register. And in the summer of 2005, Mr Haines finally had his conviction overturned on appeal.

He said: 'The prosecution offered no evidence and the court struck the matter out. Hearing what I had done, the judge said: 'Is that supposed to be a crime?'

His wife added: 'We were so close to losing everything. It's been a very harrowing experience. I am in a constant state of nervousness now – always looking over my shoulder, wondering what social services could be saying about us.

'All of us have left children unless you happen to have a full-time nanny. I'm sure most parents have left children in the car while they've paid for petrol or gone to the school gates.'

The Department for Education said: 'Parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury.' West Mercia Police said it had a duty to investigate all concerns regarding the care of children.
