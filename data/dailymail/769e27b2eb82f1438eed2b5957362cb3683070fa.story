The NHS will pay to remove breast implants at the centre of a global health scare.

For the 3,000 patients who had the PIP implants fitted on the NHS, anxiety about them will be enough to qualify for an operation to replace them with high-quality alternatives.

But last night Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also cleared the way for up to 47,000 private patients to have the PIP implants removed at taxpayers' expense – if there is a clinical need.

Helpful: The NHS will pay for its patients who were fitted with the controversial PIP implants to have them removed, it emerged today

He said there was no evidence to 
recommend routine removal, but private clinics had a 'moral duty' to 
take them out, and if they would not, the NHS would step in.

The Government would then try to claw back the money from the clinics at a later date.

Asked if women would be able to have 
implants removed by the NHS even if they were fitted privately, Mr 
Lansley replied: 'Of course it remains true – as it is for all patients –
 that if they have a clinical need the NHS is there to support them.'

Announcement: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the data available to experts has not been good enough to give them a clear idea of the risk posed by the controversial PIP implants

The definition of clinical need 
includes women whose implants are intact but are overwhelmed with 
anxiety. The Government expects most private clinics to absorb the cost 
but has pledged no women will 'be abandoned'.

It is estimated that if the NHS funded
 the removal of all 50,000 of the implants believed to be fitted in 
British women, the total bill would reach £150million.

Paying for a third would cost 
£50million, the amount clinics are estimated to have made by choosing 
cut-price PIP implants over better-quality ones.

Most of those fitted with the implants
 on the NHS will be breast cancer survivors, while private patients are 
likely to have them for cosmetic reasons.

A number of private clinics have said 
they will go under if they have to fund surgery, while others are 
charging women thousands of pounds to have the substandard implants 
taken out.

Women treated at a private clinic that has since gone out of business will also be entitled to NHS care.

Concerns about the safety of the PIP 
implants were first raised in France when surgeons noticed they were 
rupturing more easily than other brands.

The failure rate there has been cited 
as 5-10 per cent and tests show they are filled with industrial-grade 
silicone contaminated with fuel additives and window sealant.

'nothing to say' to his victims

Sixteen cases of cancer, one fatal, 
have since been linked to the implants and the French government has 
agreed to fund routine removal for the 30,000 women affected there.

Germany and the Czech Republic are also recommending removal of the implants.

Last night, after a review ordered by 
Mr Lansley, the Department of Health said its experts had concluded 
there was no link between the implants and cancer.

However, the review panel could not 
establish if the rupture rate for the PIP implants was higher than 
others – and could not rule out the possibility that some are toxic.

Mark Harvey, a partner at Hugh James 
solicitors, which is representing more than 250 women, accused the 
Government of making a 'tacit admission' that it could not compel 
clinics to act.

He added: 'What they have done is put 
the ball firmly in the court of the clinics, and we expect the clinics 
to meet that challenge and to follow the NHS's lead. If they do not, we 
will be asking the courts to compel them to act.'

It emerged yesterday that former Poly 
Implant Prosthese owner Jean-Claude Mas, 72, scornfully dismissed 
women's fears about the implants in a statement to French police in 
October 2010, shortly after his factory was closed down.

He said of women taking legal action 
against him: 'These are people who are psychologically fragile or are 
doing it for the money.'

He also admitted he used illegally 
obtained low-cost silicone gel never tested on humans to manufacture the
 implants but insisted they posed no threat to health.

Laurent Gaudon, a lawyer with a French
 implant victims' association, said of the remarks: 'This displays the 
shocking greed and cynicism of Jean-Claude Mas.'
