A 19-year-old man was killed trying to stop his drunk friend from getting behind the wheel of a high-performance car after a country concert.

Joe Ianzano, 19, from Florida, was clinging to the rear spoiler of his friend's car when it slammed into a palm tree on Saturday at around 11pm, sending him flying.

He suffered a severe head trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Coconut Creek police sergeant, Henry Cabrera.

His grandmother Barbara Ianzano said: 'It was a courageous act, but Joey was like that. He would put himself on the line. He would do things like that. This time, he was too courageous.'

She said her grandson had been trying to block the car, but his friend — who has been identified by sources as Patricio Javier Arias — managed to get in.

'Joey was saying - you can't drive. You can't drive. You are too drunk,' said Mrs Ianzano.

'I think he was trying to stop Pat, but he peeled off and took off.'

After it hit the tree on the 5300 block of Flamingo Place, the car drove across a driveway and hit another three cars before it came to a stop.

The teenager was about to start school to become a firefighter.

His family said he was a hunter and athlete who loved his big truck and was willing to give his life to do the right thing. 

Cousin Alisha Lynne said: 'The night of the accident he went to a country concert with his friends, which he had been looking forward to for months. When it was over, Joey drove his back to his house and one of his friends jumped in his car with the intention to drive home.

'Joey could tell that he was too drunk to drive and begged him not to but his friend wouldn't listen. So in a last ditch effort to save his friends Joey grabbed on to the car desperately trying to get him to stop.

'He was the most genuine and selfless person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He was my little cousin but I looked up to him like he was my older brother.

'My whole life I have always tried to imitate the ways that he was able to brighten up an entire room with nothing more than his presence.

'His trick was that no matter who and no matter what he always put the needs of others before his own. This is sadly the reasoning behind his death.'

A Joseph Ianzano Memorial Fund has been started and it has raised $1,410 so far.
