A father allegedly tried to attack his daughter's uncle in court who was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing the 12-year-old in 1999.

Karl Roberts was facing a competency hearing Monday when Andi Brewer's father Greg Brewer allegedly tried to get to Roberts in the Polk County Circuit Court.

He did not manage to attack the convicted murderer before he was tackled to the ground by Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies, according to a representative from the courthouse, reports KFSM.

In 1999 Roberts, who was a relative by marriage, was sentenced to death row for the murder in Hatfield.

Andi was the daughter of Rebecca Petty, the Rogers Republican who won the state House District 94 seat in the November general elections.

Petty told KFSM, that Brewer jumped the partition after Roberts looked back and said, 'Greg, it's all going to be okay.'

'I think he had just kind of had it,' Petty said.

 'We're just overwhelmed right now.'

According to THV11, Brewer was reportedly so distraught and uncooperative that he was put into a cell to calm down before being booked in.

Chief Deputy Sawyer said Greg Brewer's charges are pending.

The competency evaluation was to determine if Roberts could waive his post-conviction rights, following his previous murder conviction.

In a confession read to jurors during the trial, Roberts said that, after eating dinner at his in-laws' house in Hatfield, it occurred to him that his niece was home alone babysitting her younger siblings.

He told police in the confession that his niece begged him several times to take her home, but, instead, he ordered her out of the truck in a densely wooded area and raped her, then choked her. 

During the trial a defense witness, Dr. Lee Archer, testified that Roberts knows right from wrong but cannot conform his behavior to the law.

Archer told jurors that Roberts is missing a portion of the frontal lobe of his brain because he was struck by a gravel truck when he was 12. 

The frontal lobe enables people to understand consequences and reason, Archer said.

Roberts was originally sentenced to die on May 24, 2000.
