Southampton have seen their first-team squad ripped apart this summer and the feeding frenzy looks set to continue.

Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren have joined Liverpool, Luke Shaw has signed for Manchester United and Calum Chambers has moved to Arsenal.

Morgan Schneiderlin is another target for the Gunners, while Jay Rodriguez is another being courted by Premier League rivals.

Pricey: Luke Shaw became the world's most expensive teenager when he signed for Manchester United

Left-back: Matt Targett has told fans that he is capable of filling Luke Shaw's shoes this season

And all of this, of course, came in the wake of manager Mauricio Pochettino’s departure to Spurs.

Ronald
 Koeman has replaced him at St Mary’s, but who are the next set of 
academy graduates set to fill the boots of Lallana, Shaw and Co?

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at five of the next generation…

POSITION: Left-back

AGE: 18

Gareth Bale. Luke Shaw. Matt Targett? It’s an easy assumption to make but Southampton could well have a ready-made replacement for Shaw in the shape of 18-year-old Targett. The Saints fan – who joined the club at the age of eight – is already an England Under-19 international and it is thought Koeman is ready to hand him a starting role when the season kicks off.

Central midfield: Harrison Reed recently signed a new long-term deal with the club until 2018

Left wing: Sam McQueen in action for Southampton during their pre-season friendly against KSK Hasselt

POSITION: Central midfield

AGE: 19

The
 flame-haired midfielder already has seven senior appearances to his 
name and penned a new four-year contract last month. His diminutive 
stature – 5ft 6in – has led to comparisons with Paul Scholes and Reed is 
another set to start the campaign in and around the first XI.

POSITION: Left winger

AGE: 19

A ball-playing left winger with an eye for goal, McQueen made his senior bow as replacement for Adam Lallana in an FA Cup tie at Sunderland last season. The Saints moved to secure his future with a new four-year deal this summer having originally signed him as an eight-year-old.

Central midfield: Dominic Gape battles Arsenal's Jon Toral, the 19-year-old was promoted to the U21s last year

Striker: Sam Gallagher is capped at U19 level for both England and Scotland and has scored for both

POSITION: Central midfield

AGE: 19

A former captain of the Under-18 side, Gape is a tenacious midfielder who has been at the club for more than a decade. He was an unused substitute in the League Cup last season but is certain to make his debut this time around. Were Schneiderlin to exit, then Gape could well get his chance.

POSITION: Striker

AGE: 18

The pacey front-man is the most experienced of those academy graduates having already appeared 20 times for the senior side, scoring one goal. He only joined the club from Plymouth Argyle in 2012 but won a new deal until 2018 at the end of last season. He has now switched his international allegiance from Scotland to England and will be a key component of Koeman’s senior squad this season.
