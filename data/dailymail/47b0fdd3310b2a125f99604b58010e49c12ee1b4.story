These lizards may be young but they already know how to strike a pose.

The Chinese water dragons stayed incredibly still for the family portrait, showing off their beautiful bright green skin.

The six-month-old babies even showed off their playful sides by climbing up to sit on their parents' heads.

Five of the six-month-olds cuddled up for the camera but it wasn't long before they wanted something a little higher

The six Chinese water dragon siblings posed together for this family photograph

The father's red neck was on show as the youngsters clambered over his head

In one picture the father of the group proudly reveals his vibrant red neck while three of his babies use him as a bench.

The mother's neck is a lighter pink and she sits calmly with two of the youngsters atop her head.

The breed is known for liking heights and climbing tree branches - so it's no wonder they clambered over their parents.

Jordan Cadiot, 17, who owns the reptiles, took the pictures at his home in north-west France.

He said: 'I originally saw a set of pictures of different reptiles and decided to stage my own photo shoot with a white background.

'I was delighted with the results as the clear background allows you to really see the colour of the lizards.

'The photos were taken at home, the luminosity is very good when the sun is shining there.'

The father is 75cms long, while the mother is slightly shorter at 65cms.

Mum stayed calm while two of her babies climbed up her body to sit on her head

Pile on! The breed loves to climb wherever possible, even if it's only a few centimetres above the floor

Mr Cadiot added: 'The younger ones were playing when they climbed on the adult's head - they prefer being up high.

'I like showing how nature is beautiful and interesting.

'It was great that I got to spend even more time with my animals, I love to watch them play and act natural.'
