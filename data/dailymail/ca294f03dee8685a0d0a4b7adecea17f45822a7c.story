A mother-of-three who vanished as she headed to the Talladega Superspeedway alone nine days ago has still not been found - and police say they have few clues.

Theresa Benn's husband Kevin told police he dropped her off near the racetrack early on Sunday October 19, Lincoln Police Investigator Amanda Crow said.

She was last seen on Speedway Industrial Drive in Lincoln, which is more than three miles from the track. Authorities do not know if she ever made it to the track, which opened at 5am.

Kevin Dulaney, who said he left his wife to walk to the track alone because he did not want to join her at the race weekend, alerted police that she was missing at 7.30pm that day.

Authorities are looking into reports that she was carrying a purse and a cell phone at the time and they are checking her cell phone records to see if they can determine her location, Crow said.

So far multiple tips from people have turned up nothing, she said.

'There's really not a whole lot to go on,' she said. 'We have searched the area and have been responding to tips but we really don't have a small enough area to search yet.'

She added that police have interviewed people known to Benn but would not identify them.

Crow would not say whether or not foul play is suspected and that it is being treated as a missing person's case for now. 

Benn, who has two adult children and a 15-year-old, also goes by the name Theresa Andrews Dulaney. Police say they believe she has been married before and Andrews is her maiden name. 

She was wearing blue jeans, pink cowboy boots, a black tank top and a large, diamond-covered belt and buckle at the time of her disappearance.

Concerns: Theresa, with family, was heading to the track alone because her husband did not want to go

Did she make it? She had been heading to the Geico 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday October 19 (pictured) but authorities are unsure whether or not she made it there

She is described as being 5 ft 5, weighing 108 lbs and having blonde hair. 

She is the second person to go missing at Talladega in the last 18 months.

In May 2013, Nicholas Bower of Georgia disappeared the night before the Cup race at the track. His body was found 10 days later in a nearby creek, but authorities said foul play was not involved.

Anyone with information on Theresa's whereabouts is asked to call 205-763-4063.
