Malcolm Glazer's death at the age of 85 has, among other things, prompted the question, 'What role will his children now play at Manchester United?'

While Glazer Snr led the takeover of the club in 2005, since 2006 he has left the day-to-day running of the club to his sons - indeed, he has never set foot in Old Trafford.

Avram, Joel and Bryan Glazer are regularly seen at the ground but the other three, Kevin and Edward and their sister Darcie Glazer Kassewitz follow their father's 'lesser spotted' policy.

The Glazer family own 90 per cent of United - all split equally with 10 per cent listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

That means Kevin, Edward and Darcie could have more involvement at Old Trafford now - indeed, they could have the future of the club in their hands. It is unlikely they would want to sell their shares, given the strong family bond.

United are insisting it is business as usual but the death of the family head could affect how the sextet run the club.

The two most high-profile Glazers are Avram and Joel, the executive co-chairmen.

Avram is the oldest of the six children and headed 
the United takeover in 2005.

He and his brother Joel have been prominent figures ever since, taking 
over the day-to-day running of the club in 2006 after their father had a
 stroke.

They had the final say on the appointment of new 
manager Louis van Gaal.

Joel is also actively 
involved in the running of United, speaking to Ed Woodward up to three 
times a day about all aspects of the club.

Of the other powerbrokers at United, Woodward is the most prominent. He joined Manchester United in 
2005 when he acted as an adviser in the Glazer family’s controversial £790million takeover and was invited to join the club soon afterwards.

Woodward was initially involved in United’s financial planning before being handed responsibility for the club’s commercial and media operations in 2007.

Woodward became a director in 2012 and 
played a key role in United’s £1.37billion flotation on the New York 
Stock Exchange in August of that year.

It was no surprise therefore that
 he was chosen to replace chief executive David Gill when he stood down 
in June, although Woodward retained his existing title of executive 
vice-chairman and remains based at the club’s London corporate 
headquarters.

Sir Alex Ferguson will always be an iconic figure at United and
was instrumental in choosing David Moyes as his 
successor as manager and was part of the panel which picked Van Gaal.

The most successful boss in United's history was a frequent presence at matches last season as the club recorded their worst Premier League finish.

It will be interesting to see whether he is spotted at Old Trafford as regularly now Van Gaal is in charge.

Ferguson's close ally David Gill is United’s former chief executive and remains an influential figure on the 
club’s football board.

It is
 thought by some observers that United made a mistake by letting him 
leave the same summer as Ferguson and it has turned out that way.

Gill was also consulted about Van Gaal's appointment.

The legend: Long-serving boss Sir Alex Ferguson still holds power at Old Trafford despite his retirement

Richard Arnold, the group managing director, was promoted from commercial director in the shake-up 
that saw Woodward replace Gill in 2013.

He is the most senior figure at Old 
Trafford on a day-to-day basis and together with Woodward, has trebled United’s commercial revenue over the course of the
 next seven years, closing deals with major sponsors all over the globe.

Sir Bobby Charlton is, of course, a Manchester United legend, who became a director in 1984.

Charlton was a key figure in Ferguson’s appointment in 1986 
and continues to be a respected voice on team-related affairs.
