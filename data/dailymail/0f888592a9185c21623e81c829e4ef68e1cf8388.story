The killing of a Masonic leader in front a Detroit lodge in broad daylight has left detectives baffled.

Grand Master Jerry Sears was shot once in the neck while he was cleaning outside the building, located on Detroit's west side in Fenkell.

The 56-year-old was the leader of the Mt. Olive Grand Lodge Ancient York Masons. His body was found by another Mason on the lawn shortly after 3.30pm on Saturday.

It is believed the gunman came from around the corner of the building before shooting Mr Sears.

His death has stunned those who know him, who have described Mr Sears as being intelligent, articulate and logical.

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press, Barry Short, state grand financial secretary of the lodge, said: 'Who could do such a heinous thing to such a nice person? He would help everybody.'

Mr Sears was cleaning in front of the building ahead of a convention which was due to start yesterday.

More than 200 Masons from 11 states and Canada were expected to head to the event.

The lodge's grand junior warden Charles Vaughn said Sears was pleased that plans for the convention were all coming together.

He said that he had never known Mr Sears have an angry word with anyone and that he was not robbed during the shooting.

'What could that man have done to anybody to make you want to do that?' he added.

A memorial service at the convention will pay tribute to Mr Sears. A flag has been flying at half-mast since yesterday outside the lodge.

Police have not released much information about the killing. A police spokesman said they had not received any leads and says there were no witnesses.
