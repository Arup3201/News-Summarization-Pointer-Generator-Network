You're never too old to play  Nintendo Wii-Fit – because it helps keep older people on their feet, claim researchers.

Those prone to falling have most to gain from the popular computer game console, which simulates sports such as tennis, bowling and boxing.

A study shows it benefits those too frail to take part in conventional physiotherapy because they are not strong or fit enough.

They tried to make me go to rehab: Playing a Nintendo Wii Fit takes 30 per cent less energy than physio, while improving balance and coordination

Playing Wii-Fit games uses 30 per cent less energy than physio treatment, but improves the balance and co-ordination needed to avoid falls.

Researchers Dr Murray Griffin and Dr Matt Taylor, from the School of Biological Sciences at Essex University, studied 20 pensioners who had suffered heart problems.

Keeping active: Nintento Wii

In the study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the volunteers used a Wii-Fit balance board to play co-ordination and ski jump games.

Talking about the finding that the volunteers used less energy, Dr Griffin said: ‘This offers a real hope to some of the most vulnerable and elderly people in society whose frailty seriously impacts on their quality of life.’

Recurrent fallers cost the NHS nearly £1.7billion a year in hospital admissions and long-term care costs.

Not only can it cause broken bones and other physical damage, fallers are often left feeling anxious and less likely to move about.

This can have a negative effect on their quality of life and lead to depression.

It is thought the effect of Wii exercise on the brain may be similar to real exercise, which can boost levels of the feelgood chemical dopamine.
