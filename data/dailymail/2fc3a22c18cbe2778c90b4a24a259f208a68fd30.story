Israel today carried out bombing raids on the Gaza Strip in revenge for a rocket attack on a factory by Islamic militants Hamas.

The country's foreign minister also suggested it might be necessary to re-occupy the territory in a bid to stop the continuous low-level attacks from Palestinian militias.

The latest airstrikes come at a time of high tensions in the region, after three Israeli teenagers were apparently kidnapped by Hamas.

Target: The Israeli military claimed to have bombed a dozen sites linked to militant Islamists

This month alone, there have been 60 rockets fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip and 80 strikes on Gaza by the Israeli military, according to officials from the two territories.

Yesterday evening, a paint factory in the border town of Sderot was hit by two rockets fired from Gaza, setting it alight.

Israel retaliated early this morning, targeting 12 sites in Gaza believed to be linked to militant activity.

Among the targets of the airstrikes were weapons factories and concealed rocket launchers, according to Israeli officials.

Aftermath: A Palestinian militant inspects the damage today after the Israeli airstrikes

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet today: 'Over the weekend, the Israel Defense Forces attacked multiple targets in response to firing at Israel from the Gaza Strip.

'We are ready to expand this operation, if necessary.'

However, hardline foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested that small-scale operations in Gaza might make Hamas stronger and that the only way to pacify the territory would be to occupy it again.

'The alternative is clear,' he said on Army Radio. 'Either with each round we attack terror infrastructure and they shoot, or we go to full occupation.'

Revenge: Israel's airstrikes came after a paint factory in the town of Sderot was hit by rockets from Gaza

Destruction: The factory saw much of its supply rendered unusable after the rocket attack

Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but it has since become a haven for Hamas and a flashpoint for violence.

Earlier this month, tensions between Israel and the Palestinians increased when three boys were kidnapped from the West Bank settlement where they live.

Troops have been combing Palestinian neighbourhoods aggressively in an attempt to find the teenagers.
