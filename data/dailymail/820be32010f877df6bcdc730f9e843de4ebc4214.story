Louis van Gaal described his victory as 'one of the most important moments in my career' as Manchester United moved five points clear of arch-rivals Liverpool in the race for a Champions League place.

Van Gaal refused to write off Liverpool's chances of finishing in the top-four but could not under-estimate the value of a 2-1 victory after Juan Mata struck twice. It was Liverpool's first Premier League defeat in 13 games since they lost 3-0 at Old Trafford in December.

'We beat Liverpool again,' said Van Gaal. 'They were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons – with the pressure on the ball in the first half.

'Now we are five points ahead of Liverpool, and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton. To win in this moment is very important – one of the most important moments in my career.

'But there are still eight matches to go. That's 24 points. Liverpool can still be champions. When you are a top manager, or player or club – and Liverpool are – you have to deal with defeats.

'We have also dealt with defeats. We lost at home to Arsenal and then we had to play against Tottenham and Liverpool, and you have to manage that. Liverpool can do that also because they have a great manager, great club, great fans.'

Van Gaal claimed that United had 'played Liverpool off the pitch' in a one-sided first half, but struggled after Steven Gerrard was sent of seconds after coming off the bench.

He added: 'It was the best first 45 minutes because in the second half we were not so good and that's a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10. It should be easier than the first half but it was not.

'I know in a sense that Liverpool should press us and they did but we played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away.

'I came in the dressing-room and gave all my compliments because I was so happy, but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card. Then we weren't playing like a team anymore. We were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily. When we didn't have the ball we didn't press the opponent. That was different in the first half.

'Nevertheless, we didn't give many chances away. David de Gea has saved us a lot of times this season but I couldn't remember one save in this match.'

Mata, scorer of both United goals, was happy with his performance after the game, and admitted that the last few months have been difficult.

Steven Gerrard was sent off soon after coming on, but Van Gaal says it was harder to play against 10 men

'I think it's my best game in a United shirt, yes. It's a massive game, probably the biggest in English football, so to score two goals is great for me,' Mata told Sky Sports.

'The second goal has to be up there with my best. After Steven Gerrard was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end.

'It was important for me. The last few months I've not had the best moment. It is the manager who decides but I'm happy today.'

Van Gaal was sufficiently impressed, but like Mourinho at Chelsea who preferred Oscar, Willian and Eden Hazard in the three creative positions behind the lone striker, said Mata did not always fit into his formation.

'Now he is playing as a false right winger and the communication with (Ander) Herrera and (Antonio) Valencia gives him more opportunities,' Van Gaal told reporters.

'I think he was one of my most consistent players. I am not amazed, but I am very happy for him.'

Mata's second goal of the afternoon was a stunning bicycle kick to put United 2-0 up at Anfield

Brendan Rodgers struck on a new 4-3-3 formation when Liverpool lost at United, and Van Gaal revealed that he had given his players the option to change from 4-3-3 and revert to a three-man defence as well.

He said: 'Liverpool changed their system against us in the home match and then we played with three defenders at that time. We won 3-0. The coach continued with this system and they have won everything. They never lost. And then we came again. We stayed with the system that we've had the last four or five weeks.

'We had to prove it against the system we usually play. I asked the players that we can play with three defenders or shall we continue with 4-3-3? But then you have to play like a team, and that I have seen in the first half. That was marvellous to see.'
