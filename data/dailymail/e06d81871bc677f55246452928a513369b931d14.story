Egypt says it will recall its ambassador from Israel in protest over the deaths of Egyptian troops reportedly killed by Israeli soldiers.

Israel has pledged to investigate the incident and this afternoon its defence minister Ehud Barak said it deeply regretted the deaths.

Today crowds have gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo in protest.

The deaths occurred on Thursday when militants from Gaza crossed 
into southern Israel through the Egyptian desert and launched a deadly 
attack that killed eight Israelis.

At least three Egyptian troops were
killed in a subsequent shootout in the Red Sea resort of Eilat between Israeli soldiers pursuing the 
militants along the Israeli-Egypt border.

Officials in Egypt have demanded an apology saying the country was 'politically and legally responsible' for the deaths.

The decision to recall envoy Yasser Reda has escalated tensions between the two neighbouring countries.

Their landmark 1979 peace treaty is being tested by the fall of Egypt's longtime autocratic leader, Hosni Mubarak.

Egypt's interim government accused 
Israel of violating that treaty with its raid that killed the Egyptian 
troops in the Sinai Peninsula.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Israeli government was holding consultations on the Egyptian move.

While relations between the two countries have been chilly since Egypt became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel in 1979, Israel valued Mubarak as a source of stability with shared interests in containing Iran and its radical Islamic proxies in the region - including Hamas.

Several political parties issued statements condemning the Israeli raid and calling for changes to the peace treaty, which regulates the number of Egyptian troops allowed in the Sinai Peninsula.

The Muslim Brotherhood, which is Egypt's best-organized political force, said 'this crime should be dealt with in an appropriate way,' adding that 'what was possible before the revolution, will not be tolerated to continue after the revolution.'

Israeli officials insisted the peace treaty was 'stable' despite the rocky developments. The agreement called for Israel to return the captured Sinai to Egypt. In return, Egypt agreed to certain restrictions on the number of troops placed in Sinai.

'No one had any intention to harm Egyptian security personnel,' Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli Defence Ministry official who works closely with Egypt, told Israel Radio. 'The question is what happened in the field and that is what is being investigated.'

The cross-border attack has raised concerns about the increasingly lawless northern Sinai Peninsula, whose borders with both Israel and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip make it an attractive staging ground for Palestinian militant attacks on Israel.

Egypt last week moved thousands of troops into the Sinai Peninsula as part of a major operation against al-Qaeda inspired militants who have been increasingly active since Mubarak's ouster.

A security official said 22 Islamic militants have been arrested.

Israel says Gaza militants armed with guns, explosives, mortars and an anti-tank missile, killed eight Israelis in a roadside ambush after infiltrating Israel through Sinai.

The Egyptian troops were killed as Israeli soldiers went after suspected militants who fled back into Egypt.

Israel has offered conflicting accounts about how the Egyptians were killed. But the Egyptian Cabinet, in a strongly worded statement, held Israel 'politically and legally responsible for this incident,' saying lax security on its side allowed the ambush to take place.

'The Egyptian ambassador to Israel will be withdrawn until we are notified about the results of an investigation by the Israeli authorities,' the Cabinet statement said, demanding an immediate probe.

It said Egypt would take all measures and send reinforcements to protect its borders and 'to respond to any Israeli military activity at the Egyptian borders.'

It was the first time in nearly 11 years that Egypt decided to withdraw its ambassador from Israel. The last time was in November 2000 when the Egyptians protested what they called excessive use of violence during the second Palestinian uprising.
