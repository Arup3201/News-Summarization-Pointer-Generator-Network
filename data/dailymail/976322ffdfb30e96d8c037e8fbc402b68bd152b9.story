It was the picture that broke the nation's heart - Hawkeye the Labrador lying longingly by his master's coffin as the Navy SEAL's emotional funeral was conducted.

But Hawkeye will not be alone for long as the deceased soldier's best human friend has stepped in to offer the dog a home.

It has been revealed that Scott Nichols, a close friend of Petty Officer Jon Tumilson, who was killed in the major U.S. helicopter crash in Afghanistan this month, will care for Hawkeye.

Sadness: Navy SEAL Jon Tumilson's Labrador retriever Hawkeye was loyal to the end, as he refused to leave his master's side during an emotional funeral

Man's best friend: Mr Tumilson's family members followed Hawkeye into the service before he lay down

Nikki Virgilio, a friend of Mr 
Tumilson (known as J.T.) who was at the funeral, said Hawkeye was a 
personal pet rather than a military dog.

'I
 can happily report to you that Hawkeye was willed to one of J.T.'s good
 friends, the same one that took care of him whenever J.T. was deployed 
overseas,' she wrote on Facebook.

The Des Moines Register revealed this close friend to be Scott Nichols, who said at the funeral that the fallen SEAL was more scared of his parents dying than being killed himself.

‘J.T. was going to be a Navy SEAL come hell or high water,’ Mr Nichols said. ‘He wasn't afraid of dying.’

Ms Virgilio 
wrote on Facebook that Mr Nicols had previously taken care Hawkeye while Mr Tumlinson was deployed abroad.

Hawkeye captured the public’s emotions when a photo taken by
 Mr Tumilson’s cousin, Lisa Pembleton, and showed the Labrador retriever refusing to leave his master's side.

Mr Tumilson, of San Diego, California, was one of 38 killed on August 6 when a rocket-propelled grenade took out a U.S. Chinook helicopter.

Pride: Mr Tumilson's mother and father were told they helped raise an 'outstanding man - a hero'

His funeral was held on Friday in his hometown of Rockford, Iowa, at the Rudd-Rockford-Marble Rock Community School.

Ms Pembleton said: ‘I felt compelled 
to take one photo to share with family members that couldn't make it or 
couldn't see what I could from the aisle.

'To
 say that he was an amazing man doesn't do him justice. The loss of Jon 
to his family, military family and friends is immeasurable.'

During the service, U.S. Navy Lieutenant
 Robert Bradshaw told Mr Tumilson's parents that they helped raise an 
‘outstanding man - a hero’.

Family, friends and servicemen, along 
with Iowa Governor Terry Branstad and U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, 
packed the school's gymnasium.

Mr Tumilson, who joined the Navy in 1995, was known to friends as J.T.

‘If J.T. had known he was going to be 
shot down when going to the aid of others, he would have went anyway,’ 
friend and soldier Boe Nankivel said.

Mr Tumilson's sister, Kristie Pohlman, said he always dreamed of joining the military's elite special forces unit.

‘Your dreams were big and seemed impossible to nearly everyone on the outside,’ she said. ‘I always knew you'd somehow do what you wanted.’

Family members followed Hawkeye into the service. Mr Tumilson is survived by two sisters and his parents, George and Kathleen.
