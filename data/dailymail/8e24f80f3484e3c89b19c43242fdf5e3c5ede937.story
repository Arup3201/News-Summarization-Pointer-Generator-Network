Around 30 people gathered in San Francisco on Saturday to take part in the sixth annual World Naked Bike Ride by pedaling through city streets completely in the nude.

Along with  rides in cities across the globe, the cyclists were demonstrating in protest of the world's dependence on oil.

To ensure their message was heard, the freewheeling demonstrators whizzed past such tourist hot spots as Fisherman's Wharf, the Marina, Embarcadero and the Haight.

'Tens of thousands of naked bike riders are protesting the global dependency of our society and economies at the hands of the oil cartels,' reads the announcement on the World Naked Bike Ride Facebook.

'We want to emphasize the harm this dependency causes to our environment, businesses and social lives.'

According to the page, the group rode in solidarity with Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and other cities across the Southern Hemisphere.

It was the first of four such naked rides held each naked bike riding season.

'We want to endorse more bike riding and our nudity expresses our vulnerability to these matters. It also draws attention to our cause,' reads the group's Facebook.

The post also counseled that, despite 2015 marking two years since San Francisco's controversial nudity ban, no one has been cited during a naked ride.

That appeared to have remained the case with Saturday's ride. 

However, the same wasn't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the Castro District was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law, which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits.

Play it cool: The group assured riders that no citations had been issued for any of their several rides per year under the new anti-nudity laws

Nobody got a permit for the protest, and officers arrested two men and a woman who ignored officers' warning that they were violating the ordinance.

Officers said the trio had to be taken into custody instead of being cited because they did not have identification.

The newspaper said those arrested were George Davis, a veteran nudity protester, and Gypsy Taub and her husband Jimmy Smith, who held a nude wedding on the steps of City Hall in 2013.
