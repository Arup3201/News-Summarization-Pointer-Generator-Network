There is no escaping police dog Troy who managed to sniff out a suspect after tracking him for two miles. 

The German Shepherd was called into action after a Mercedes was stolen from a house in the village of Winscombe, in Somerset.

Police lost sight of the car but later found it abandoned in nearby Brockley Combe, a wooded beauty spot.

Scent: Police dog handler Jim Hampson with Troy who tracked a suspect for two-miles

It is believed the thieves fled the scene twenty minutes before Troy arrived with his handler PC Jim Hampson to see if he could pick up a scent. 

The keen-nosed canine detected a trail and followed it through woods and across fields leading them straight to the suspect close to the entrance of Bristol Airport - two miles from where the car was found abandoned.

The pair turned up as the wanted man was being quizzed by another police team who had seen him acting suspiciously at the side of a main road. 

A 28-year-old man was later charged with theft and four-year-old Troy got a public pat of the back from Chief Constable Nick Gargan.

He tweeted: 'More great police dog work overnight. This time, our canine colleague Troy tracked for over two miles before finding a suspected burglar.'

PC Hampson, who has had Troy for three years, said: 'I'm very proud of his drive and determination.'Tracking is his best skill and he'll go on and on.

'We went over a fence and through wood and over fields and it's a real challenge keeping hold of him.'
