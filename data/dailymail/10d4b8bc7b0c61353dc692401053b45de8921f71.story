It's been a long wait but after Fifty Shades of Grey premiered in at the Berlin Film Festival last night, and so far the hotly-anticipated film has been given a  bit of a spanking.

Many reviewers who caught a New York screening the day before lamented the lack of sex in the the film adaptation of EL James's erotic novels.

And now critics have dismissed it as 'bleak', 'gloomy' and reminiscent of a 'teen romance' although Dakota Johnson has been singled out as the clear star of the kinky flick.

Talk about method acting!  Dakota Johnson walks the Berlin Film Premiere in a both demure and seductive Dior gown just as Anastasia Steele would have.  The long sleeves hide the rope burns while the plunging neckline draw the eye to her pretty porcelain decolletage.

Raf Simmons has directed the house of Dior into a new minimal, edgier direction but at the core of all his designs is the feminine aspect of a lady of Christian Dior.

Whether it's on the red carpet, a charity benefit bash or prom, this kind of dress is impeccably proper for all formal occasions.  The long sleeve and length elongates the body while the sharp slice of skin keeps the dress from becoming dowdy.

Bleak: Critics have slammed Fifty Shades of Grey calling the film 'bleak' and criticising Jamie Dornan's performance as Christian Grey

The film, which follows the romance between bondage-loving businessman Christian Grey and hapless student journalist Anastasia Steele has been one of the most talked about releases of the year.

However, it seems to have fallen far short of expectations, with the only person singled out for praise being film ingenue  Dakota, 25, in her first major role.

Kaleem Aftab of the Independent bemoaned the film's, 'obvious,' visual metaphors and claimed the plotting of the film would have seemed, 'light in a teen romance.' 

He says of the first section of the film: '[It] plays like the opening of a porn movie in which a washing machine repairman will turn up at a house and be met by a bored housewife.'

However, he says: 'The daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson is notable for more than having her mother’s good looks, as she jumps from being naive to forthright with aplomb.'

Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and author EL James hit the red carpet in Berlin last night, Taylor-Johnson has said she is not reading any criticism

Disappointment? Some critics have pointed out that there are no shots of genitalia in the film 

Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian said: '“I don’t make love. I f**k. Hard.” With these bold but very misleading words we are introduced to what is the most purely tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history.' 

Bradshaw goes on - like many other critics - to point out that there is a noticeable dearth of genitalia in the film. Indeed, for a movie which is predominantly about sex, it is reported that you barely see Mr Grey below the belt.

He jokes: 'There are no glimpses of a penis in this film, not in any state. It’s primly off-camera. Or maybe the smoulderingly sado-obsessed hero does not have a penis.' 

Too many clothes? Movie critics remarked on how little sex there was in the film version of Fifty Shades of Grey

The Sydney Morning Herald refers to it as 'bleak', with film critic Philippa Hawker saying: 'Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel have turned EL James' overheated, annoying first-person narrative (the first novel of a trilogy) into a somewhat gloomy vision of expectations and desires, the story of a man's will for control and a woman's resistance.'

However, at New York Magazine, David Edelstein was pleasantly surprised. 'It’s elegantly made, and Dakota Johnson is so good at navigating the heroine’s emotional zigs and zags that you want to buy into the whole cobwebbed premise. 

In fact, he describes it as 'Jane Eyre with ropes'.

But the hero comes in for some criticism and he says Jamie Dornan, 'cuts a less commanding figure than you’d hope, so the first look between Anastasia and Grey is a non-event. 

'With his fluffed-up hair and pert, pretty little face, Dornan’s Grey looks more like a natural bottom than a top. He’s a bantamweight. Although I did grow to appreciate his modest, unshowy acting, it’s clear he’s not sending much heat her way and that she’s having to work herself up in a vacuum.'

Pants on: One writer noted that Dornan spent much of the raunchy film with only his shirt off

And although she again praises Dakota's performance she notes that Jamie has a more difficult time making Mr Grey's character believable. 

Similarly the New York Times questioned Jamie's role in the film. A.O.Scott said: 'Mr. Dornan has the bland affect of a model, by which I mean a figure made of balsa wood or Lego. 

'What vitality “Fifty Shades of Grey” possesses belongs to Ms. Johnson, who is a champion lip-biter and no slouch at blushing, eye-rolling and trembling on the verge of tears.'

However Scott says that there is something to be said for the film in that there is a shared enjoyment of its viewing, however awful it may be. 

He said: '“Fifty Shades of Grey” might not be a good movie — O.K., it’s a terrible movie — but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment.' 

Sam Taylor-Johnson has revealed that she doesn't read the criticism saying: 'I don't read anything. It's a golden rule to live by I think.  

'Otherwise if you read all the good things and then one bad thing it's the one bad thing that you will remember and it haunts you so it's better to not read anything. 

'But people do keep telling me little bits and I'm like, "shhh,' I don't need to hear.'
