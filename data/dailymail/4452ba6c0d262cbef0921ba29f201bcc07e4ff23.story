Animal lovers are being given the chance to own their own zoo, complete with 200 different species of animal, for less than the price of a house in London.

Blackbrook Zoo, near Leek in Staffordshire has gone on sale for £350,000, almost half the price of the average London house (around £603,000) because of low visitor numbers causing the tourist attraction to go into administration. 

The owners are even throwing in the animals, which include penguins, emus, flamingos and meekats.

The meerkats are some of the animals that owners of the zoo are keen to keep in the enclosures, hoping  to make the tourist attraction profitable again

For the 'bargain' price of £350,000 buyers would get the land, 40 enclosures and 30 aviaries as well as a visitor centre and cafe

The 40-acre zoo is also home to over 200 different types of birds, as well as a reptile house with 32 species of lizards and snakes.

For £350,000 buyers get the land, 40 enclosures and 30 aviaries as well as a visitor centre and cafe.

Negotiations would have to be made with the third party owners of other animals but they are said to be keen to keep them all at the site in a bid to resurrect the failing business.

John Hinson, the agent from chartered surveyors Hinson Parry and Co., said: 'It is quite an usual sale but we have already had interest from three series parties.

'It has been a zoo for so long it is a great site to take on and we hope to see it thriving again soon with the right owner.

'It really has great potential. The site is in pretty good condition and only needs a few upgrades here and there and the retail and commercial opportunities are huge.

The 40-acre site is also home to over 200 different types of birds, including endangered ones

Because of the odd nature of the sale, it is likely that a person hoping to re-invigorate the business will become the buyer

'There is a functioning tea-room and two barns - one which has a bed-sit for security as well as incubators while the other is a visitor centre. It really is quite a pleasant setting already.

'This is an attractive proposition for somebody with the right entrepreneurial spirit and for the price of only £350,000 it is very cheap for what you get for your money.'

The zoo is home to rare, endangered and even critically endangered birds - including Humboldt Penguins, Pelicans, Flamingos, Storks, Cranes, Emus, and owls.

It also has meerkat, lemurs wild boar, goats, chipmunks and spiders.

Since it opened in 1991 the attraction has regularly introduced more animals and attractions, such as footpaths, water features, a tea room and a picnic area.

The attraction reported a record high of 55,000 visitors in 2012, but it has since struggled attract that many again, and liquidators were called in last month.

Administrator Phil Wood, from Barringtons Charted Accountants, said: 'It’s a great shame this situation has occurred, particularly as the site is so well known to so many families in the area and a valuable educational tool for our schools.

'This is one of the best known visitor attractions within a district which depends heavily on tourism, and we are very keen to find a buyer to take it on.

'The Zoological Park needs to be taken to the next level of appeal and enjoyment.

The zoo went on the market because of low tourism numbers, and its owners are hoping it will sell for up to £350,000 including the animals

'We think there is huge potential for business growth, through the retail and catering opportunity on site and to maximise the extensive level of capital investment that has been injected by the directors over the last two decades.

'Visitor numbers have declined of late, but in the right hands, they can quickly return.

'A consortium of staff members are prepared to take it on as a going concern, but they need outside investment, so there is a real opportunity for someone with an entrepreneurial flair to get involved.'

Staffordshire Moorlands MP Karen Bradley added: 'It really is brilliant and a place I often go when we have visitors to entertain.

The park also comes complete with a visitor centre and cafe, which are both fully functioning

The visitor centre houses all the information necessary about the zoo's animals, and its hoped that it will be kept intact as a zoo rather than being bought for land

'It is the jewel of the Staffordshire Moorlands and a place that has something on offer for all the family.

'I really hope somebody will step in to save it.'
