In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Anne Hammond awoke to a peculiar shrieking sound.

It was vaguely familiar but it wasn't until she turned to her husband that she was able to put her finger on it.

'It's a frog,' he said. 'A frog's cry for help.'

Indeed it was. But much to the couple's surprise, there was another creature waiting for them outside their Millner home - a northern suburb in Darwin.

A frog was found under the eaves of a Darwin house up on its side while a snake was pulling it from the other side

Anne Hammond says she was woken my a screeching noise coming from the frog at 4am on Tuesday

Ms Hammond, who was sleeping with her windows open during the warm night, was woken to the strange screeching noise at 4am.

'I've definitely heard it before - kind of like what a cat would sound like if it catches a frog,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

She jumped out of bed and grabbed her torch to investigate the source of the sound.

'We spotted the frog under the eaves of the house up on its side and then realised there was also a snake,' she said.

Ms Hammond used her broomstick to give the creatures a nudge and helped the frog escape to safety

'The two were stuck in a stalemate - the snake was inside the roof mesh wire while the frog was outside.

'The poor frog had its leg caught in the snake's mouth and it wouldn't let go.'

Ms Hammond gave the green tailless amphibian a nudge with a broomstick, which freed the frog as it quickly hopped away.

As for the serpentine, it slithered away into darkness.

'I couldn't sleep that night because all I could think about was that snake in my roof,' Ms Hammond said.

'I've lived here for 30 years but I was more shocked to see that rather than the frog - we've got them everywhere.'
