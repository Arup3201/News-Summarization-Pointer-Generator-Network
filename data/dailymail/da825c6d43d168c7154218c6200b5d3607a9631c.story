Gareth Chip cut off half of his neighbour's ear for turning down the oven in their communal kitchen when he realised something was burning

A thug who chopped off half of his neighbour’s ear for tampering with his food in their communal kitchen has been jailed.

Steven Brown had turned down the gas when he realised something was burning in the shared oven and opened a window to let out the smoke.

Newcastle Crown Court heard when Gareth Chip, 31, realised the cooking temperature had been adjusted on his supper, he threatened to stab Mr Brown before slicing off a large chunk of his left ear.

The court heard the wound left blood 'streaming down like a tap'.

Medics were able to re-attach the severed flesh back on to Mr Brown’s ear.

Chip was jailed for six years for the attack at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Simon Hickey told him: 'You brought a knife to the scene and cut off a person’s ear, or part of it.

'Fortunately, he had his ear sewed back on with 13 stitches.

'He was simply cooking in his kitchen, in an area shared by you and you took umbrage.'

At the time of the attack Chip was on bail for punching a vulnerable man and stealing his rucksack in what the judge described as a 'mean' offence. 

Chip was given a further ten months behind bars for theft and common assault, which he admitted.

The court heard Chip still denies he was the knifeman who attacked Mr Brown, who had to relive his ordeal from the witness box.

Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court: 'The defendant was cross about the temperature being turned down on the oven.

'He swung a knife at his head and cut his ear.

'He cut off part of the ear. It was stitched back on.'

Chip, of Hylton Castle, Sunderland, denied he knew anything about the attack.

He was tried by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court who found him guilty of wounding with intent.

Glen Gatland, defending, said Chip started using cannabis at the age of around 13 to cope with his brother’s death.

Mr Gatland said Chip does not lead a 'pro-criminal lifestyle' and is capable of hard work.

The court heard during the trial the men had lived in next-door flats at in Sunderland, last September 7, and had a shared kitchen.

Shortly before midnight, Mr Brown realised something was burning in the oven and went to sort it out.

Mr Hodson said: 'The defendant came into the kitchen, he was drunk and agitated. He began to be aggressive and threatened Mr Brown. Mr Brown walked out of the kitchen.

'The defendant followed Mr Brown with a kitchen knife and made a threat he was going to "stick this into you". Mr Brown tried to calm the situation down. The defendant lunged with the knife at his head.

'He moved his head quick enough to avoid a head injury and the blade caught and cut right through his left ear. The defendant said "I will take the rest of your ear off and I will stab you. Luckily, he didn’t.'
