An ambitious British project to drill two miles under the Antarctic ice to look for signs of life has been abandoned.

Researchers said they were unable to create a large underwater cavity needed to circulate water to the team's drill.

It follows a last minute dash to send a spare part for the drill from Britain - which had allowed them to restart drilling.

The team's test drill hole. They now face a race against time to drill 2 miles into the ice to try and reach a frozen lake where they will look for signs of microbial life

The team's 12 scientists have been working around the clock to try and save the mission

The malfunction could mean that the project, which took 16 years to plan, would have to be abandoned

The first borehole was drilled to a depth of 300m and then left at that 
depth for 12 hours to create a cavity.

The second, main borehole 
(located 2m away from the first) was then drilled to 300m depth and 
should have immediately connected with the first cavity. 

This main borehole 
would then continue through the cavity and down to the lake while the 
first borehole would be used to recirculate water back to the surface 
using a submersible pump. 

In this way, the ice cavity can be used to 
balance the level of water in the boreholes and hence balance the 
pressure from the lake upon breakthrough. 

For reasons that are yet to be determined the team could not establish a
link between the two boreholes at 300m depth, despite trying for over 
20 hours. 

During this process, hot water seeped into the porous surface
layers of ice and was lost. 

The team attempted to replenish this water
loss by digging and melting more snow, but their efforts could not 
compensate.  

The additional time taken to attempt to establish the 
cavity link significantly depleted the fuel stocks to such a level as to
render the remaining operation unviable.

Reluctantly the team had no 
option but to discontinue the programme for this season.

'In the early hours of Christmas Day 
Professor Martin Siegert, Principal Investigator of the Subglacial Lake 
Ellsworth experiment, confirmed that the mission to drill into the lake 
has been called off for this Antarctic season,' The British Antarctic Survey said.

Drilling was proceeding 
well during the weekend after a replacement part was fitted to the 
boiler used to heat water for drilling.  

However, Drilling stopped after the team was unable to form properly the 
water-filled cavity 300 metres beneath the ice.

This cavity was to link
the main borehole with a secondary borehole used to recirculate 
drilling water back to the surface.

'On Christmas Eve we took the decision to cease our efforts to directly 
measure and sample Subglacial Lake Ellsworth,' said Professor Siegert.

'Although circumstances 
have not worked out as we would have wished, I am confident that through
the huge efforts of the field team, and our colleagues in the UK, we 
have done as much as we possibly could have done, and I sincerely thank 
them all.

'I am also hugely grateful to the UK Natural Environment 
Research Council for making it possible for us to attempt the direct 
exploration of subglacial Antarctica.

'Sixteen years ago, we hypothesised
that deep-water subglacial lakes are viable habitats for life, and 
contain important records of ice and climate history. For now, these 
hypotheses remain untested.

Once back in the UK I will gather our 
consortium to seek ways in which our research efforts may continue. I 
remain confident that we will unlock the secrets of Lake Ellsworth in 
coming seasons.'

The project was also hit by mechanical problems.

The drill is powered by 
hot water, but was halted when the resister inside a boiler burned out.

A spare was sent from Britain via Chile to the remote camp in West Antarctica.

Twelve 
scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have worked around the 
clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice-locked Lake 
Ellsworth to collect samples of water and sediment.

The 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt

They
hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated
for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer.

However, the team has vowed to return.

This is of course, hugely frustrating for us, but we have learned a lot
this year,' said Professor Siegert.

'By the end the equipment was working well, and much of it 
has now been fully field tested. 

'A full report on the field season will
be compiled when the engineers and programme manager return to UK.

The
BAS team have been trying to melt their way down to Ellsworth using a 2
mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water 
heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch.

The £7million project to drill beneath two miles of Antarctic ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure.

The Lake Ellsworth drill site on the West Antarctic ice sheet: Four British scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice

For Queen and country: The mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent

One of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes
in Antarctica, Ellsworth is equivalent in size to the UK's Lake 
Windermere, measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and nearly 500ft
deep.

Completely cut off from any light from
the Sun, any life lurking beneath its waters must endure complete 
darkness, intense pressure and subzero temperatures.

It is only geothermal heat from the 
Earth's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice 
above that has kept it liquid.

Should any organisms be found living 
in its icy depths, they could offer tantalising clues as to how life 
might look elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the ice-covered 
oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa.

Expedition leader Chris Hill confirmed they were past the point of no return and feared the water would re-freeze in the pipes and borehole, halting the programme.

The BAS team planned first to bore 
down to 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second 
borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way 
down to the lake.

The cavity is what controls the 
pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of 
prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and 
spilling out over the surface of the ice.

Once they reach the waters, they will 
have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense UV
light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before 
the hole refreezes again.

Technology: The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch

Lake Ellsworth is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the Antarctic: Equivalent in size to the UK's Lake Windermere, it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and is nearly 500ft deep

Chris Hill, a British Antarctic Survey
engineer who is heading the programme, spoke earlier this month to the 
Guardian by phone from his tent on the West Antarctic ice sheet.

'It's bloody cold,' he said.

The team will spent six weeks at the 
site, where temperatures, according to the BAS, are -25C, with winds of 
20 knots. For much of that time they will work around the clock.'

Lake Ellsworth Principal Investigator 
Martin Siegert from the University of Bristol said: 'This British 
mission is part of an international effort to discover and explore 
subglacial lake environments. 

Team effort: The 12-man team have been working around the clock to shovel snow to feed their hot-water drill - until the boiler frustratingly malfunctioned

Inhospitable: The team have been battling against freezing cold weather to complete their mission

Ambitious: Intrepid engineers and scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have been trying to drill two miles to an ice-locked lake deep beneath the glaciers of the western Antarctic

'We are about to explore the unknown 
and I am very excited that our mission will advance our scientific 
understanding of Antarctica’s hidden world. 

'Right now we are working round the 
clock in a cold, demanding and extreme location – it’s testing our own 
personal endurance, but it is entirely worth it.

'The technical difficulties are something that are not unfamiliar in Antarctica - it's a hostile environment and very difficult to do things smoothly.

'The good news is that we found the fault relatively early on in our deployment system and so we have quite a lot of fuel that is left remaining.

'If we didn't have that of course we wouldn't be able to continue any further.'
