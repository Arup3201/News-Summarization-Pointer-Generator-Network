Tragic: Leila Fowler was stabbed to death in her home

California police searching for the murderer of an eight-year-old girl who was stabbed to death in her home believe they may have collected finger prints and DNA from the crime scene.

As the manhunt continues for the man who killed Leila Fowler in Valley Springs, authorities are also still talking to the victim's 12-year-old brother who found his sister slain in the family home on Saturday afternoon. 

According to police, the boy encountered the intruder who immediately fled leaving the bloody evidence of his crime for the terrified child to find.

He called 911 and she was later pronounced dead at hospital.

Captain Jim Macedo told reporters that the victim's brother is not being treated as a suspect at this time, but that police 'are continuing to talk to him which is normal because he was the last person with the child.'

He added that police expect to have lab results of the prints and DNA findings in a week.

Residents in Calveras County have 
been ordered to lock their doors as deputies search for the suspected 
killer, who is described as a white or Hispanic male with long gray 
hair.

He is believed to be at least six feet tall and was last seen wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants.

A neighbor said he spotted the suspect fleeing shortly after the 911 call.

Police officers from neighboring areas have been called in to help as authorities hunt down the suspect.

While door-to door searches are proving fruitless, the residents are still reeling shock that in such a quiet, rural area, such a thing could happen.

'This is way too close to home,' Julia Poland, who took her 13-year-old daughter to an afternoon news conference on the search, told the Modesto Bee. 'This kind of thing does not happen here.'

A neighbour, Roger Ballew told the Associated Press: 'I was working on my tractor and a CHP copter kept flying over my house.' After a SWAT team showed up at his house Saturday night and told him to stay inside, he admitted: 'It was nerve-wracking, I didn't sleep well.'

Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs around noon on Saturday when he encountered the intruder, who immediately fled

Immediately after the 911 call was 
reported, a quarter-mile perimeter was set up around the house as police
conduct the house-to-house search.

'We were doing a house-to-house search 
and in some cases we're searching extensively into attics and storage 
sheds,' Calveras County officer Jim Macedo told CBS Sacramento. He added: 'It’s a 
difficult area to search. It’s rural, it’s remote.'

Macedo said the girl was suffering from severe injuries and her death has been ruled a homicide. He urged residents to keep their doors locked until they find the suspect.

Leila would have turned nine-years-old in June.
