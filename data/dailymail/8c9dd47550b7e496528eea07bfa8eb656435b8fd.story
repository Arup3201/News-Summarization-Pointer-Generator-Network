Ricky Burns will move up to light welterweight after confirming he will take on Argentinian Leonardo Esteban Gonzalez in Leeds next month.

The Coatbridge fighter has failed to win any of his last three fights at 135lbs - including the loss to American Terence Crawford in March which cost him his WBO world lightweight title.

He was also involved in a controversial draw with Raymundo Beltran 12 months ago but Burns admits it was his split decision loss to Dejan Zlaticanin in June which convinced him it was time to move up a division.

Now the former two-weight world champion will set about resurrecting his career against Gonzalez, 32, over 10 rounds at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on October 4.

Burns claimed his first world crown four years ago when he beat Roman Martinez to win the WBO Super Featherweight title and the 31-year-old believes he can bring back those glory days up after moving up to 140lbs.

'I believe that the move up in weight will really benefit me,' said Burns, 'The Lightweight limit was proving tougher to make in my last few fights so that's now behind me and I can concentrate on working on my boxing in the gym with Tony Sims.

'It has been a tough year following the Raymundo Beltran fight but I'm feeling great in the gym and the fire and desire is still there to achieve big things.

'I'm looking to show in Leeds that I've still got the goods to challenge for major belts and ultimately, win another world title.'
