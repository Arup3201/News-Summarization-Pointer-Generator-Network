A super-slimming bride has  lost over seven stone in time for her wedding day. 

The hairdresser finally decided to lose weight when she was ordered off a ride at Walt Disney World in Florida for being too fat.

Becky Hames, 25, from Cannock in Staffordshire piled on the pounds after gorging on an unhealthy diet of McDonald's, crisps and chocolate bars since childhood.

At her heaviest, Becky tipped the scales at 17st 4Ibs and ballooned to a hefty size 24.

Her bulging waistline of 39in meant she was unable to bring herself to try on wedding dresses after her fiancé Stephen, 27, proposed to her in 2011.

But the final straw came the following summer when her family took a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.

While queuing for a ride at the Aquatica water park, Becky was horrified when lifeguards told her she could not go down the slide in case she got stuck. 

She was then left in tears as she was forced to embarrassingly walk back down the steps in front of dozens of other people.

Yet the incident inspired her to take drastic action and lose weight in time for her wedding day, so after returning from holiday, she joined her local Slimming World in Cannock

Becky says: 'I didn't want to be a fat bride but the incident at Disney World just tipped me over the edge. That is when I felt the most down.

'They stopped me from going on a water slide because they said I was too big. It was horrible and so embarrassing having to walk back down in front of all those people. 

'In the end none of my family went on it because they didn't want to leave me behind.

'It's one of the worst things to ever happen to me and just left me feeling rubbish. It was then I knew I had to do something about my weight in time for my wedding.'

Incredibly within 18 months she had lost more than seven stone and weighed a trim 10st 2Ibs. 

Becky managed to slim down for her big day by transforming her diet and now eats at least 10 fruit and veg portions a day.

She explains: 'We had been engaged a year and had set a date but I couldn't bring myself to try on any dresses because I just felt so awful about my weight.

'Stephen always said he loved me whatever size but I had to do this for me.

'Now I am just two pounds off my personal ideal weight and have gone from a size 24 to a size 12.

'My wedding dress even had to be taken in, I was beyond chuffed.

'I felt amazing, I had never experienced feeling good in clothes and the first time I ever wore a dress was for my hen party.

'When I saw the wedding picture I knew all the hard work was worth it. I still can't believe it is me.'

Last month, the blushing bride tied the knot with Stephen, an IT worker, in a lavish ceremony at Moor Hall Hotel in Sutton Coldfield. 

Now the couple are planning to head back to Orlando for a two week honeymoon, so Becky can finally experience the slide she was banned from.

She added: 'I am really looking forward to going to water parks and wearing a swimming costume without having to wear extra clothes to try to cover myself up.

'I feel as confident as ever and I'm going back there so I can finally ride this slide - it better be a good one.'
