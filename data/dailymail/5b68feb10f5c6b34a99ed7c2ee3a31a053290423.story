A racist yob, who gave a white supremacist salute outside court, has admitted uploading a YouTube video showing a life-size golliwog doll being hanged by a person in a Klu Klux Klan costume.

Christopher Philips made the offensive gesture to photographers outside Wolverhampton Crown Court last week.

The 23-year-old, formerly known as Darren Clifft, was told at a hearing today he could face prison for trying to 'stir up racial hatred'.

He was arrested by Counter-Terrorism police in March after 
posting the footage of a mock-execution onto the internet.

Philips pleaded guilty to distributing and recording visual images, which were shot at an extreme right-wing concert held in West Wales.

But he denied wearing the Ku Klux Klan outfit, which the prosecution accepted, and the charge of using threatening or insulting behaviour intended to stir up racial hatred was ordered to lie on file.

The court heard his father had committed suicide shortly after Philips was arrested and interviewed about the racist crime.

Adjourning sentence until December, so a psychiatric report can be carried out, Judge John Warner told Philips: 'The fact that I’ve allowed your bail to continue is not in any way at all tying my hands.

'The overwhelming likelihood is that you will receive a period in custody.'

Judge Warner said the mock-execution videos had caused 'strong feelings'.

He
added: 'It’s the sort of material that will attract very strong 
feelings in certain sections of the community and I think there is a 
real risk here of violence and retribution.'

Defending Philips, Mohammed Ramzan said: 'His father committed suicide, one of the reasons was this case.'

The court heard Philips, who had a 'huge online presence' and called himself ‘Clansman of the West Midlands infidels’ on Twitter, had received death threats from anti-racist groups.

Mr Ramzan said: 'His life was threatened. People did attend the gym where he coaches kick-boxing, fortunately for him he was ill that day so not there.

'It was a gathering of quite a few people with weapons. His mother is very anxious for the address not to be revealed because she fears for her safety.'

As well as being bailed to live and sleep at his mother's address in Wolverhampton, Philips was given an electronic tag and told to keep to a 9pm-7am curfew.

He was also ordered not to access any social media websites.

Philips, who wore a grey suit with a white shirt and striped tie, left court quietly with several members of his family and friends after yesterday’s 45-minute hearing.
