A school has joined the trend for excavating basements, and has opened underground classrooms after it ran out of space.

The underground learning area at Finton House School, in Tooting, south London, features a glass-lined stairwell decorated with trees, which directs natural light into classrooms.

Architects dug underneath the playground to accommodate 320 pupils in a glass-sided extension which is 80 per cent of the size of the building above ground.

It took a year to build the 400sq m teaching space, which houses 320 pupils aged four to 11

Lucy Wheeler, registrar at the private school, for children aged four to 11, in Tooting, south London, said: 'It has been designed to go under the playground to maximise the amount of space for children at the school in terms of classroom sizes and not take away any playground space.

'We had to do some very careful investigations to make sure the water table would not be affected.

'While the building development has allowed to make more space, there will be no increase of pupils.'

The Emma Thornton Building was named after a former headmistress and school governor who died of cancer in 2011.

The development is the latest  in a growing trend for ‘iceberg’ homes and developments where projects dig down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions.

Planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea have soared from 13 in 2001 to 307 last year.

It fell to architects Dinwiddie MacLaren to find a solution by creating specialist classrooms 85 per cent below ground level.

The £3,000-a-term private school was expanded by an additional 400sq m to include new science, design and technology and music classrooms

The new building features a glass-lined stairwell decorated with trees, which directs natural light into classrooms.

It also features a 'light well' which the glass-sided classrooms 'look out' on to - with some teachers saying they actually have better lit classes underground, than above it.

A spokesman for Dinwiddie MacLaren said: 'The building was created in response to the desperate need for extra space within a tight urban site in south London.

Some teachers say they actually found the underground classrooms were better lit that the above ground areas

'The key to the success of this building below ground was to create an illusion of being at ground level. 

'The light-filled stairwell is lined on all sides with frameless glass with a bespoke digital design inspired by the surrounding lime trees.'

Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool.

Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street. 

His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park.

Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house.
