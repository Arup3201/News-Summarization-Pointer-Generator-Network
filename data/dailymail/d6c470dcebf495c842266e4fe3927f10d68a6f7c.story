Students at a college in Vermont have been warned to tread lightly after a four-foot-long snake mysteriously disappeared from a science lab.

Castleton State College sent out a campus-wide email reporting that Brazilian rainbow boa constrictor had gone missing but it was non-venomous and trained to only eat frozen dead mice.

Officials at the school believe the orange-colored reptile was stolen and did not escape as its cage  had a weighted lid.

The door to the classroom it inhabited was also locked shut.

'We’re treating this like a larceny,' Keith Molinari, director of public safety, told the Rutland Herald.

'It’s under investigation the same way any other theft would be.'

A California-based reptile store pegs the value of the snake at around $200.

According to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the Brazilian Rainbow Boa can grow up to six feet in length and live up to 20 years in captivity.

In the wild its diet consist of rodents, birds, and possibly some forms of aquatic life and lizards. They are widespread throughout much of South America.

Castleton State College's snake went missing over the weekend, sometime between Friday afternoon and Tuesday morning while classes were postponed due to snow.

It apparently has orange-colored skin with black markings. Anyone with information is asked to contact the school.
