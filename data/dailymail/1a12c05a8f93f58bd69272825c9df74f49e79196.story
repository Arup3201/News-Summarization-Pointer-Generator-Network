A juror has been released from high-profile Jodi Arias murder trial, the third member of the panel to be dismissed this month.

Juror No. 8. was released from the case after being arrested last Saturday on a DUI charge.

The 52-year-old man apparently got so 
drunk that he blabbed to police about how he had spent the past four 
months as a member of the Jodi Arias jury.

One week to go: The trial of Jodi Arias is about to reach its conclusion, however the jury seems to be having it's own dramas. A third juror has been dismissed from the case after being arrested for 'extreme DUI'

John Lyle, from the Gilbert Police Department in Arizona told RadarOnline.com 'On April 20, Daniel Gibb was arrested for extreme DUI.

During the arrest Mr. Gibb claimed that he was a juror currently sitting on the Jodi Arias trial, and the arresting officer was called to the court to speak in a sealed meeting with the judge, the prosecutor and the defense attorneys handling the trial.'

The police explained that the 'extreme' classification meant that he was suspected of being at a certain level of intoxication after the arresting officer did a series of tests.

Accused: Arias is on trial for the killing of her boyfriend, Travis Alexander, in Mesa, Arizona in 2008. If convicted, Arias faces a potential death sentence

Although the contents of the secret meeting at the Maricopa County Courtroom remains confidential, just two days later the man was dismissed by Judge Sherry Stephens for no apparent reason.

Juror No. 11 — another man — was excused because of health reasons on April 12, and a woman who was Juror No. 5 was dismissed on April 2, reportedly for making statements that showed a bias.

Closing stages: Dr. Kevin Horn is one of the final witnesses on the case which is expected to conclude towards the end of next week

That now leaves the jury with 15 people - nine men and six women who will deliberate whether Jodi Arias, 32, goes free, spends the rest of her life behind bars, or is executed by lethal injection for the murder of Travis Alexander.

Twelve jurors eventually will be selected at random to decide the fate of Arias, who claims she killed her 30-year-old lover in self-defense at his suburban Phoenix home in 2008.

Prosecutors say Arias, 32, planned the attack in a jealous rage. She could face the death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder.

Arias initially denied involvement then later blamed the attack on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense.

Almost five months into the trial, the prosecution has now presented its final witness.

A medical examiner testified about the wounds of victim Travis Alexander.

Dr. Kevin Horn, who performed the autopsy, said a gunshot injury through Alexander's brain would have rendered him unconscious and unable to defend himself.

Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Mesa home in June 2008. Authorities also said his throat was slashed.

'Again because of the injury to the brain, the information processing part of the brain would have rendered him unable to raise his hands to offer any sort of purposeful action or to verbalize anything,' Horn said.

Arias wept during part of Horn's testimony and members of Alexander's family averted their eyes when monitors showed autopsy photos.

The trial, which began January 2nd, resumes on Wednesday with a final defense witness. Closing arguments are then expected before the case goes to the jury.
