A four-year-old boy who was killed as he slept alongside his twin brother is pictured here for the first time.

The victim has been named locally as Riley Turner, while his brother is called Kenzie.

The youngster was carried out of the house by his distraught stepfather as he screamed: 'Somebody please help.'

The boy, whose twin brother was not hurt in the incident, was said by a neighbour to have been stabbed in the neck and body as he slept alongside his identical twin brother.

A manhunt was launched and seven hours
later police in Keighley, West Yorkshire, arrested a 32-year-old man in
a railway tunnel on suspicion of murder.

The ambulance service was called to 
the house in Harewood Road, Oakworth, Keighley, at 4.40am yesterday and 
the youngster was pronounced dead at Airedale General Hospital later.

Mother
Sharon Smith lived at the 
address with twins Riley and Kenzie and her 22-year-old partner Guy 
Earwaker, who is not the children's father. The couple also have a 
two-month-old baby.

Memorial: Tributes to Riley were left outside the home where the boys lived with their mother and stepfather

The twin's uncle Peter Smith, 49, a 
local DJ, said: 'I spoke to Sharon this morning and she was distraught. 
She could only tell me that she'd been asleep in bed and there had been a
horrible incident. It's tragic what happened.'

Neighbour Audrey Currie, 40, said she heard screaming during the early hours 'but didn't realise it was anything.'

She said: 'I just thought it was a lot of drunk people.

'I
could hear a man and I could definitely heard a lady screaming. A 
friend of mine actually saw the little boy, she saw the man come out 
with the boy in his arms.'

see police with machine guns walking up the road, lots of police.'

Police said the man in custody was arrested at 11.30 am. According to 
locals he was seized in a tunnel on the historic Keighley and Worth 
Valley Railway.

Steam trains were cancelled for more than three hours after police with dogs traced the suspect.
