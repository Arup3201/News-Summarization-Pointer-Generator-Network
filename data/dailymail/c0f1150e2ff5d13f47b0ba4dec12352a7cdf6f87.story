A woman who claims she was involved in Prince Harry's infamous naked party antics in Las Vegas claims to have been gifted his underpants which she will today use as part of a strip-tease act.

British-born Carrie Reichert is to perform a routine involving her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she says she met the Prince in 2012. It is thought her act will involve twirling what she says are his undergarments.

Miss Reichert, under the stage name Carrie Royale, will perform the act at the Harry Mohney Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas.

 Carrie Reichert, who was supposedly involved in Prince Harry's infamous naked party antics in Las Vegas claims to have been gifted his underpants which she will today use as part of a strip-tease act

Prince Harry, pictured above in Las Vegas in 2012, was said to have invited 10 women to party with him at his VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel, including Miss Reichert

The 40-year-old is then going to donate the underpants, along with a bathing suit she wore, to the museum, the Las Vegas Review Journal reports.

Kensington Palace has previously denied Miss Reichert was one of the women invited back to the Prince's VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel and dismissed her story as 'untrue'.

It is not known exactly how Miss Reichert intends to use the underpants in her act. She claims he gave them to her in the VIP suite where another female guest took an infamous naked photo of him which was later published.

Miss Reichert, the only woman to have ever spoken out about the prince's wild night in Vegas, claims she was one of 10 women picked to party with him. She also claims to have kissed Prince Harry while he was naked.

Of the night in question, Miss Reichert has previously claimed that he was already naked when she entered the room and was playing air guitar with a pool cue.

She claimed he was giving 'random naked hugs' and was being 'really friendly'. 

Miss Reichert has also previously claimed that she spent 15-20 minutes kissing Prince Harry before he told that she was 'beautiful and gorgeous' and returned to the party.

Just weeks later Miss Reichert spent a month in Harrison County Jail in Mississippi after being arrested for cheque fraud.
