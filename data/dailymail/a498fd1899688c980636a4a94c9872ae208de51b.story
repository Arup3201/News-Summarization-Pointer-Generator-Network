A woman has tragically run over and killed her own mother on New Year’s Eve after the pair watched a fireworks display together.

The 79-year-old woman was hit in the carpark of Club Banora leisure centre in the small community of Banora, in Tweed Shire, north NSW, at around 9.30pm.

It’s believed the elderly woman was standing on a kerb in the car park when she was seen to fall.

Her 54-year-old daughter’s vehicle then allegedly crushed her after the driver hit the accelerator instead of the brake.

Local woman Julie Myles, who runs a video store nearby, spoke about the community’s distress over what happened.

‘I’m sure everyone will understand that it is just one of those tragedies.’
