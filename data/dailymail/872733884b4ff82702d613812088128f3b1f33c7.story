Fay Hand, 37, has taken phone giant EE to a tribunal because she claims she was unfairly dismissed

A call centre manager is suing mobile phone giant EE after claiming she was sacked because a member of her team kicked another employee until they were unconscious.

Fay Hand, 37, was dismissed from the firm's Darlington-based centre because she was said not to have done enough to tackle bullying and harassment among employees under her.

The mother-of-two has now taken EE to a tribunal, claiming unfair dismissal after working at the company for 17 years.

The hearing was told an investigation was launched after one of the 100 staff under the operations manager kicked a colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious last October.

In mitigation after the event, the employee told bosses he lashed out because he had been provoked, and said the month previously colleagues had pinched his car keys and removed a Fifa computer game from his car.

He claimed he had been harassed at work, that the game was held to ransom and that there had been a fake disciplinary hearing about it.

The call centre staff were skilled members of the EE team with a higher technical knowledge of the network system, and better paid than regular call handlers, the hearing heard.

Mrs Hand, from Teesside, knew about the incident with the game being taken from the car, and delegated it to a junior manager to deal with.

EE claimed she should have followed up the incident as a senior manager, and made sure it was properly dealt with, as it had an 'almost zero' tolerance of harassment and bullying.

Seven employees were sacked as a result of the incident - including the man who kicked his colleague, the victim and their team leader.

John Mitton, representing the claimant, told the tribunal at Teesside Magistrates' Court: 'We believe that the punishment being summary dismissal is completely disproportionate for someone with this amount of service and an exemplary record.

'At the very worst, a final warning should have been issued.'

Damian Robson, for EE, told the hearing: 'The respondent has identified banter as a dangerous pastime for the business.

'However, no decent employer would want a sterile environment to work within. However, that must be clearly managed.

'The claimant is the person tasked with carefully managing that. She did not.'

The tribunal at Teesside Magistrates' Court (above) was told how an investigation into Mrs Hand was launched after one of the 100 staff under her kicked a colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious last October

EE was a company which had to protect its brand and public image 'to a strenuous, sensitive degree,' he argued.

The tribunal judge Gerald Johnson reserved judgment for two weeks.

After the hearing, Mrs Hand wept as she recalled her time with the firm, which she said had made her a 'scapegoat'.

She said: 'I put an awful lot of time and effort into that job. I loved it and everyone who worked with me would vouch for that.'

She said EE had sacked seven other people before she was fired, adding: 'I think they considered it would be fair to issue the same treatment. I would argue it is not.'
