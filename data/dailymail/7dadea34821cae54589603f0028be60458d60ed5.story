Accused: Richard De Wit, 43, from Ridderkerk, in the Netherlands, is charged with the murder of 24-year-old Sarah Groves, from Guernsey, UK, during a backpacking trip in India

The Ducthman today appeared at the Lower Court in Srinagar, Kashmir, wearing a khaki coloured t-shirt and beige trousers.

During the brief hearing, a version of his 100-page charge sheet translated from Urdu to English was handed over to his defence team.

The translation had been requested by De Wit's defence lawyer, Indian Supreme Court Advocate Shilpi Jain, during the previous hearing.

De Wit, from Ridderkerk, Netherlands, was charged with the murder when he was found 45 miles from the scene.

He is believed to have fled in a 
small boat which capsized, forcing him to swim to shore. The accused was
 wearing wet clothes, without shoes and carrying a passport on the night
 of the murder.

Miss Groves, from Guernsey was found 
by the houseboat owner's son in the early hours of the morning on April 6
 after he heard screams coming from her cabin.

She had suffered 45 knife wounds, most on her fingers, hands and arms, indicating she had fought ferociously for her life.

Police said the 24-year-old (pictured left) was 
found inside the boat and had defensive wounds to her wrists and arms. 
Richard De Wit was seen running from the scene and was captured by 
police 45 miles away

De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three days before the killing, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves.

They were the only two tourists 
staying on the boat. Miss Groves had been there with her 25-year-old 
boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda since February.

A Kashmir police source claimed that De Wit had smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned to his cabin on the night.

He reportedly became paranoid that 
Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and
 allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife.

‘He has confessed to killing the girl but at this time he is not giving any further detail.’

Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered.

He is said to have confessed to killing her after smoking cannabis, triggering delusions that she was a Dutch spy.

Detectives are also probing claims that Miss Groves, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was conned out of money before her death.

De Wit is being held in the region's central jail having received treatment in a government-run psychiatric hospital.

Miss Groves was born in Manchester in 1988, moving to Guernsey when she was four with her parents.

She and her older half-brothers, Ben, 26, and Tom, 31, grew up in a large manor house on the island.

Miss
 Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools, 
first at Blanchelande College in Guernsey, then as a boarder at the 
£30,000-a-year St Mary’s College in Ascot, Berkshire.

She
 studied at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London before returning
 to Guernsey, having decided to become a fitness instructor.

After
 qualifying, she worked for two years at the five-star Old Government 
House Hotel, leaving last August after deciding to go travelling.
