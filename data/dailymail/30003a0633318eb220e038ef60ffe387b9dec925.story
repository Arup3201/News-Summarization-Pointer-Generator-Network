A disgraced doctor who failed to notify authorities of his 'severely impaired vision' before running over and killing a pensioner in his £80,000 sports car has been struck off.

Dr Aloke Basu had cataracts in both eyes when his Porsche 911 Carrera hit great grandmother Shirley Watkins, 74, as she crossed the road in Southend, Essex, in February 2010.

The 67-year-old told Basildon Crown Court he 'didn’t see' the widowed mother-of-two and was jailed for two years for causing death by dangerous driving in May last year 2011.

Disgraced GP Aloke Basu (left) has been struck off the medical register after running over and killing pensioner Shirley Watkins (right) in his Porsche. A tribunal heard he had failed to inform the DVLA of his poor eyesight.

A medical tribunal has now banned Basu from practising medicine in the UK following a two-day hearing in Manchester.

The
tribunal heard how Basu had ignored advice from two eye specialists 
stating he must make the DVLA aware of his chronic glaucoma and 
short-sightedness.

His
eyesight had deteriorated to such an extent that one of his eyes could 
not read the top line of a standard eye test chart from just 20 feet 
away.

A person with normal eyesight can read the line from ten times that distance - 200ft.

Basu, from Thorpe Bay, Essex, did 
not attend the tribunal but argued that he felt his condition was 
'stable' and denied evidence that eye specialists had advised him not to
drive.

In a letter, the discredited doctor said: 'As far as my knowledge is concerned my condition was stable and I was never advised by my consultant not to drive.

'If I felt that my eyesight fell below the legal standards on the day of the accident, I wouldn’t have got behind the wheel of my car.'

Basu had been a well-respected GP at Shoebury Medical Centre before the fatal crash but on Wednesday the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service ruled he must be struck off the General Medical Council register.

Dr Harvey Marcovitch, who chaired the panel, ruled Basu’s actions had brought the profession into disrepute.

He said: 'The panel is satisfied the matters underlying Dr Basu’s conviction involved a serious departure from the standards of behaviour which the public is entitled to expect from a doctor and diminish the public’s trust in the profession.

'In the panel’s judgment, Dr Basu’s conduct was fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to be a registered medical practitioner.'

Basu has 28-days to appeal the panel’s decision before his name is permanently removed from the GMC register.
