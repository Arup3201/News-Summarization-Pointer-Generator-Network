Police investigating the murder of a popular hunting TV host in Montana do not believe the man was having an affair with the woman he was visiting when he was shot dead by her husband.

Gregory Rodriguez, the host of The 
Sportsman Channel show 'A Rifleman's Journal', was shot and killed on Thursday night in Whitefish, Montana, where he was on a business trip.

After firing the fatal shots, the shooter, Wayne Bengston, 41, brutally beat 
his wife, took his two-year-old son to a relative's house, and drove to 
his home in West Glacier, Montana, where he turned the gun on himself.

Despite the belief that Bengston shot Rodriguez in a jealous rage, police said that it does not appear that Rodriguez was having an affair with the woman.

Whitefish Police Chief Bill Dial said that Rodriguez and the woman, who works for a firearms manufacturer in the Flathead Valley, met at a trade show and struck up a casual relationship that officers do not believe was romantic.

Rodriguez, a married father of two, was in Montana on a business trip, his family said in a statement on Saturday.

The family said: 'Greg 
was a wonderful husband, father, son, brother and friend. We love him 
and will miss him dearly. Please respect the family in their time of 
mourning and allow them to grieve in peace.'

An outpouring on social media has followed the death of Rodriguez, who combined his comfort in front of the camera and travels to exotic locations with his hunting and shooting expertise into a popular program.

The Sportsman Channel said that in January 'A Rifleman's Journal' won 'Best Instructional/Educational Program' at the Sportsman Channel's Sportsman Choice Awards.

'We're all in a state of shock and disbelief right now,' said David Kelly, a spokesman for the Houston Safari Club, of which Rodriguez was a member.

After the shooting at Bengston's mother-in-law's home, Flathead County sheriff's deputies responded to Bengston's West Glacier home and found Bengston's truck in the driveway.

The SWAT 
team also responded, but they were unable to make contact with the man.

When they entered the home, they found Bengston dead inside of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said.

Rodriguez, 
from Sugar Land, Texas, leaves behind his wife Lisa and two children, 
including a 13-year-old son who is frequently featured shooting animals 
with him on theÂ Rifleman's Journal Facebook page.

Zebras,
wild boar, sheep, leopards and brown bears are among the gun-down 
animals he is pictured showing off. He hunted in 21 countries and killed
140 species of big game, according to his website.

He
had repeatedly defended the Second Amendment on the Facebook page in 
recent weeks, posting pictures to counter the government's bid for gun 
control.

Besides appearing
on TV, he's the CEO of Global Adventure Outfitters, which helps hunters
book 'some of the finest trophy hunting and wing shooting outfitters 
around the world', according to its website.

According to the site, he was also an
editor at Shooting Times Magazine and a contributing editor at 
Petersen's Hunting, Guns & Ammo and Dangerous Game.

Rodriguez was the founder and CEO of Global Adventure Outfitters. That company declined to comment.

According to the company's website, Rodriguez was a mortgage banker before a trip to Africa led him to alter course in the 1990s and start pursuing hunting for a living.

He eventually traveled to 21 countries on six continents on that quest, the company said.
