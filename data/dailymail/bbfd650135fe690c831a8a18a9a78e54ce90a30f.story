Karen Culverwell fell for a smooth-talking serial conman who went on to swindle her out of 200,000 pounds

Despite spending a year in jail for duping four women out of their savings, Roy Moyse had not changed his ways.

Within months of his release he  was trawling bars and nightclubs  for more lonely, vulnerable women  to fleece.

So when he met Karen Culverwell, a divorcee who was about to receive a £245,000 settlement for her broken marriage, she made the perfect target.

Pretending to be a successful businessman, the jobless gambling addict wormed his way into Mrs Culverwell’s affections, and soon the couple were living together.

Thinking of him as her ‘rock’, she told Moyse all about her lucrative divorce settlement following the sale of the six-bedroom marital home she used to share with her company director ex-husband.

Moyse, 45, persuaded her to let him set up an online bank account for her, and help handle her bills. In reality, the only person he helped was himself – to her cash. 

He swindled her out of £200,000 in two months, including £70,000 in one particularly lucrative week, blowing much of it in betting shops.

Mrs Culverwell, 50, a housewife throughout her marriage who had limited computer skills, said: ‘I wish I had looked him up on the internet before I started a relationship with him, but it’s not something you think to do straight away. 

‘I wasn’t that good on a computer at the start, I could just about write emails – nowadays I have much more knowledge.

‘Even when he set up my online banking I was reluctant because I didn’t know how to use it, which is why he organised the bills and had access to my accounts.’

She could have discovered the fraudster’s past online in seconds, as his previous crimes had been widely reported. 

A web search would have shown that Moyse was sentenced to three years in March 2008 for a string of similar scams dating back six years, including conning three women out of tens of thousands of pounds – and that he had even tricked a fourth woman by pretending to be a barrister while awaiting trial. He was released after 12 months.

Mother of two Mrs Culverwell only discovered the fraud when she tried to buy a new home and was told by her bank that she had no money left. 

Every morning she had watched as Moyse walked out the door in a smart suit, thinking he was heading to business meetings. 

In fact, he had spent his days blowing her money in betting shops.

The conman was jailed again for two years this week at Bournemouth Crown Court. Yesterday Mrs Culverwell, of Christchurch, Dorset,  branded him ‘completely heartless and disgusting with no conscience’.

‘You read about this sort of thing happening to other people and your first reaction is to think “what a stupid person”, and “what a fool to believe all that”,’ she said.

‘He was a calculating, professional conman and I don’t believe I had a chance. He has fooled people cleverer than me and lived in a fantasy life full of compulsive lies.’ 

Mrs Culverwell met Moyse in a bar, where they bonded over their appreciation of soul music. She had separated from her husband Robert amicably after 20 years in 2010. She moved out of the former marital home in June 2011, and shortly afterwards Moyse moved in with her.

‘He would leave the house suited and booted, telling me he was interviewing or having meetings. I had no reason to disbelieve him,’ she said. ‘I had no idea about the gambling. In fact, when I wanted to put a bet on the Grand National he told me he had never put a bet on anything.’ 

When she confronted him after discovering her account had been drained, Moyse kept lying, claiming he used the money to pay for work-related bills – and that he would reimburse her with a loan. When that never materialised, she contacted police.

Moyse was charged with six counts of fraud. Earlier this month he admitted one count relating to unauthorised bank transfers. The others, which involved credit cards, were left on file.

Moyse, of Poole, Dorset, admitted swindling Mrs Culverwell out of £150,000, but he is thought to have benefited from more than £200,000 including loans she gave him that were never repaid. 

Mrs Culverwell, who has had to take a job as a sales manager, said: ‘Some days  I have no idea how I managed to stand up, let alone  work full time and care for  my family.

‘I loved and trusted this man and to think I allowed him to not only be in my life, but my daughters’ lives too, it makes me feel sick.

‘I am determined to make sure that no other woman falls into his trap. He has no right to destroy people’s lives and he has to be stopped once and for all.

‘I found the strength to come forward with the support of my family and friends and I hope other people who may have been affected by him will go to the police.’ 

Mrs Culverwell has complained to her bank over the irregular transactions, and the matter has since been referred to the financial ombudsman.
