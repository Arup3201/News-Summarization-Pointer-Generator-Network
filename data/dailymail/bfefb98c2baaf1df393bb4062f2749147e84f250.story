Armed police officers had to be called to calm down furious passengers who confronted British Airways staff during a 10-hour flight delay at Heathrow Airport on Monday.

The New York-bound passengers were unhappy with the handling of the situation and demanded to know when their flight to JFK Airport would depart after they were stranded by a mechanical fault on a BA plane.

The ugly confrontation occurred after they spent three hours in stifling conditions on a packed Boeing 747 before being allowed to disembark and return to the terminal until a replacement aircraft was ready.

But some of the passengers became enraged as time passed and surrounded BA staff at a boarding gate desk inside Terminal 5 to find out what was happening. 

Passenger Brenda Baxter, 59, said: ‘It was very scary. My first thought was that there had been a terrorist attack.

‘It was awful. There was a big crowd up by the desk and people were getting really irate. The next thing, about ten armed police turned up. 

The Nottingham woman added: ‘Six of them took up positions behind the desk and others stood amongst the seated passengers. It was very intimidating.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that officers were called at 3:30pm to ‘reports of a disturbance’ at Gate 33 in Terminal 5.

There were no arrests and officers left the location around 50 minutes later, the spokesman added. 

Passenger Brenda Baxter, from Nottingham, said the sight of armed police officers was 'intimidating'

British Airways said in a statement: 'We apologise to customers for the delay to their flight. Our crew and gate team cared for customers, provided refreshments and as much information as possible, before the flight departed.

'We appreciate that this was a frustrating experience for customers but their safety will always be our highest priority.' 

A Heathrow Airport spokesperson declined to comment, saying the airport does not comment on security matters.

Mrs Baxter, an art festival organiser, was travelling with her 26-year-old daughter Meghan to celebrate her 60th birthday.

Tempers flared after passengers spent three hours in stifling conditions on a packed plane

But the dream trip turned into a miserable experience when the mechanical fault was discovered and passengers were held on the plane while engineers attempted to fix the problem.

She said: ‘It was awful. We were told there was a fault with the hydraulics and they switched off the air condition.

‘Parents were stripping off little kids because it was so hot. A guy next to us was in a bad way. They were using face wipes to cool him down.

‘It was only after two hours that they gave us refreshments – water and orange juice.’

Passengers were given food vouchers and allowed to return to the terminal, where an hour later and announcement informed them that the plane would be ready to board in a matter of minutes.

But passengers were soon informed that the crew could no longer fly because they were ‘out of hours’, adding to the delay.

Mrs Baxter said: ‘There was a big cheer when they said we would be boarding in five minutes. An hour later they said it was all off.

‘It was awful. Children were in tears and there was a lot of argument going on.’
