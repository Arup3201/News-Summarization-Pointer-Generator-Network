A cameraman was scratched and burned by a ghost while filming a possessed Pennsylvania property, the homeowners claim.

Deanna and Tom Simpson have lived at the Maple Avenue, Hanover, home for seven years even though they say more than five ghosts and a demon constantly harass them.

The couple also said a supernatural being scratches people inside the house.

In a bizarre twist, FOX 43's Nick Petrillo claims he was scratched and felt his hand burning during just minutes into filming an interview with Deanna Simpson.

'Because you’re telling the story. 
Because you’re putting it out there ... right now that is their way of a
 warning,' Deanna Simpson said while putting holy water on Petrillo's 
arm.

The Simpsons said they encounter terrifying apparitions every day.

Deanna Simpson said it started when she dreamed two men were standing over her. When she opened her eyes, they were beside her bed staring at her.

Another time, she looked into the bathroom mirror and saw the reflection of a dead, blonde girl lying on the floor.

'It's beyond anyone's belief, it's horrible,' Deanna Simpson told The Evening Sun.

'It started with small things like the sound of footsteps, doors closing on their own and crying or sobbing coming from empty rooms. I was desperate to calm the house down and kept asking God to heal this home.'

The Simpsons also said a demon roams the house. It appears in photographs as a seven-foot-tall 
shadowy figure.

'I have some here (supernatural beings) that are protecting 
me, some women here that are protecting me, but the majority are bad, 
dark forces, inhuman,' Deanna Simpson said.

The couple said they found out their house was haunted after moving in.

They can't find a buyer, or rid the home of demons despite visits from priests, mediums and paranormal investigators.

'This house is not like the haunting people talk about with a drawer opening on its own,' Deanna Simpson told YDR. 'That's mild, that's wonderful. This is hell.'
