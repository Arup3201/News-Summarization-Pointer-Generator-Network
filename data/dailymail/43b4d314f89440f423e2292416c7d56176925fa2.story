After 80 astounding years, Tom and Jean Cheetham are yet to have grown  sick of each other - in fact - they are as adorably affectionate as the day they first met on a blind date.

They may be Australia's oldest couple but Tom, 103, and Jean, 100, still act like love-struck teenagers - holding hands, constantly complimenting one another and saying the 'L' word as much as possible.

With Valentine's Day just around the corner, Daily Mail Australia thought it only made sense to ask the country's cutest centenarians the secret to their relationship success.

Tom, 103, and Jean 100, Cheetham have been together for 80 years and counting

The country's cutest centenarians got married 76 years ago in 1938 and have never looked back

The loved-up pair hold hands as much as possible - while walking, sitting and even watching TV

A new survey released by Groupon for Valentine's Day reveals that 65 per cent of Aussies believe their relationship will last over 50 years, despite the average marriage lasting just 12 years. 

And these enduring love birds know just how to make that happen.

The first handy love tip the couple offered was to never turn down the offer of a blind date. 

The pair met eight decades ago when Tom's mate was dating Jean's sister - the foursome took a row boat out from The Spit to Roseville and back in Sydney's north shore - and they have been inseparable ever since.

They got married four years later in 1938  and bought a home two days before the wedding for about 1,000 pounds in the now affluent north shore suburb of Mosman.

The family home, that had barely changed since they purchased it, was just sold in December for a tidy $1.62million.

The fiercely independent couple reluctantly moved into a retirement home in October after Tom fractured his pelvis and shoulder.

Daughter-in-law Anne Cheetham, who is married to their only son Kevin, said they didn't think Tom was going to pull through after the bad fall.

'We didn't think he would make it but he bounced back to the way he used to be - it's incredible,' she said told Daily Mail Australia.

'Until then Tom used to walk up the street to do the shopping everyday but Jean is a bit unsteady on her feet so he would do everything  - he had just recently bought a new mower,' she said. 

'We would get in cleaners and people to mow the lawns but he would dismiss them because they never did a good enough job.' 

The first handy love tip they offered was to never turn down the offer of a blind date which is how they met

The couple have two children, Pam, 74, and Kevin, 70, four grandchildren, nine great grandchildren and three great great grandchildren.

Tom worked at what is now Australia Post for 49 years and ten months and Jean started out as a milliner but then worked as a florist for more than half a century. 

The strength of their relationship has required a commitment of hard work from the delightful duo.

'They are willing to listen to each other - they have similar ideas anyway - they have a strong sense of loyalty and they treat each other nicely,' Anne said. 

'They are like two peas in a pod - of course they get cross with each other from time to time but they are always together.' 

'It sounds cliche but they don't take each other for granted.' 

The cute couple are naturally very affectionate with each other and their loved ones and think people should to hold hands as much as they can.

'They always do that when walking along the street and even hold hands while they are sitting down watching TV,' Anne laughs.

Another golden rule that the charming couple abide by is to never break promises

 Tom and Jean say its best to regularly tell your partner you love them and what it is that you love about them

Another golden rule that the couple abide by is to never break promises.

'They have strong views about that - maybe it was their upbringing and they learnt by example,' Anne said.

'They did it tough when they were young that can keep you together.

'It's simple things like never competing with one another - there is no competition between them.'

As one in four Australians say they need help when communicating with their partner - Tom and Jean advise to regularly tell your partner that you love them and what it is that you love about them. 

'Jean loves Tom's blue eyes and is always telling everybody she loves him,' Anne said. 'She's always telling us she loves us too.' 

Anne is not sure why the pair have lived such long and healthy lives.

'They liked to do a lot of walking and neither of them are on any medication,' she said.

'They are not big drinkers and don't smoke - they were never party people.'

So, how long will this endearing pair kick on for - can they make another decade? 

'Well we've written them into our will,' the 71 year-old joked. 

'I think it will be a case of when one goes so will the other.'
