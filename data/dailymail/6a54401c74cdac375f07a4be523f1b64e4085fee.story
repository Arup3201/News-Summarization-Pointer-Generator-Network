Accused killer Jodi Arias kissed her new love interest and laughed with his friends just 24 hours after she stabbed and shot her ex-boyfriend to death in his shower, the man testified in court today.

Ryan Burns testified in her murder trial in Phoenix on Wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and phone calls with Arias after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008.

He invited her to his home in West Jordan, Utah in June 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned, telling Burns she had got lost, driven the wrong way and slept in her car for a while, he said.

In fact, she had spent the previous day with her former boyfriend, motivational speaker and insurance salesman Travis Alexander, at his Mesa, Arizona home as they had continued to have a sexual relationship.

Five days later, Alexander was found stabbed 27 times, his throat sliced and with a gun wound in his head. The prosecution has alleged that Arias, 32, was obsessed with Alexander and killed him after he revealed he wanted to start dating another girl.

While at first denying that she had even seen him that day, Arias eventually claimed that she killed him in self defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their relationship.

Yet when she visited Burns the day after the murder, she never once mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day, he said in court.

When she arrived at his home, Burns noticed that she had bandaged hands, but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job, he said.

Testimony: Burns said they kissed and laughed with his friends soon after she arrived at his home in June 2008

They settled down to watch a film together - and soon got physical, he told the court.

'At some point we were talking and we kissed,' he said. 'Every time we started kissing it got a little more escalated. At some point she was kissing my neck, I was kissing hers, but our clothes never came off.'

Burns said they resumed their kissing later that night when she climbed on top of him, but they stopped as he did not want her to regret the visit due to her Mormon beliefs about sex.

Burns, who is also a Mormon, was unaware that just 24 hours earlier, she had been posing provocatively for photographs later found on her murdered ex-boyfriend's camera.

Suspect: Travis Alexander's friend and roommate who found his body in June 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that Jodi Arias had been stalking and threatening the man

While she was confident with Burns, he said she became 'shy' and a 'little awkward' around his friends, but that she never acted as if anything more significant was wrong.

'She was fine, she was laughing about simple little things like any other person,' he said. I never once felt like anything was wrong during the day.'

Burns said he did not know Arias was still seeing Alexander when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other,Â ABC News reported.

The prosecution showed parts of their online conversations to the court, including a message where Arias told Burns she had 'trust issues' with Alexander and had been cheated on twice in the past.

Burns' testimony, which continues on Wednesday afternoon, comes one day after Arias sobbed as prosecutors displayed images of the horrendous wounds she inflicted on Alexander.

Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's'

She wiped away tears as the  Maricopa County 
medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty.

If
she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a
'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona.

Yet the medical examiner said he could 
not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the 
body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the 
killing.

With the delicate brain tissue also 
decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or 
how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander
was still alive.

The prosecution also showed images of Alexander's bloody bathroom and bedroom after the killing.

Others showed defensive slash wounds on
Alexander's hands, sustained when he tried to fight back, and grazes on
his legs, suggesting his body was later dragged.

They also displayed images found on 
Alexander's camera, which included sexually explicit images of the pair,
photos of him in the shower moments before his death.

In a bizarre twist, the camera also contained images of Alexander after the murder and a picture of Arias dragging his body - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped.

Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days.

Arias originally claimed she had not 
seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two 
men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense.

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.
