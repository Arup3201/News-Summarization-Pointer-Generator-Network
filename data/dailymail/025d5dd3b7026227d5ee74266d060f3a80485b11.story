26-year-old Seattle woman Chantae Gilman is facing rape charges after a man alleged he woke up to find her on top of him in his apartment, pinning his arms down

Gilman has prior felon convictions for attempted robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle, The Smoking Gun reports.

According the the police report, on the night of the attack the man had attended a birthday party for a neighbor known to Gilman. 

'Once arriving home he fell asleep on his bed,' reported Detective Roger Ishimitsu. 'Victim slept very hard due to a long day.'

He woke at 2 a.m. to find the 5'7''. 240-pound Gilman on top of him with his erect penis inside of her.

His hands had been 'pinned down over his head,' according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

DNA taken off the victim's body at Harborview Medical Center matched a sample of Gilman's DNA

He told her to get off of him but Gilman ignored him. Finally he was 'able to work his way out from underneath' her.

He was then able to eject her from the apartment before going to the Harborview Medical Center for a sexual assault examination. 

It's still unclear how she was able to get into the apartment.

Gilman denied knowing the man to police and said she did not remember being at his house or having sex with him.

Detective Ishimitsu wrote: 'She said that she has a mental illness and suffers from Bipolar disorder and Psychosis.'

A sample of her DNA matched female DNA recovered from the sexual assault kit.

She has since been charged with second-degree rape for assaulting a victim 'incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse by reason of being physically helpless.'

The victim told police he woke up in apartment to find the 5'7''. 240-pound Gilman on top of him with his erect penis inside of her

According to recent Facebook posts, she said she was '2months sober and I'm 31 weeks pregnant.'

She is the mother of two other young children. 

Detectives agreed it was unusual to have female charged with such a crime.

'From a statistical standpoint, yes, it is atypical to have a female 
aggressor,' Detective Drew Fowler, told KOMO, 'but we work to hold all people responsible for their 
actions. The law is specifically written to be gender-equitable and we 
will charge anybody with a crime that they've committed.'
