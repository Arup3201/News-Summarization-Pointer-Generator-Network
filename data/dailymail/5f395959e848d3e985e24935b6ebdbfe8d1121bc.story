Introducing the world's highest car showroom.

On the 112th floor of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, bosses of the Ford motor company showed off their new model - a yellow Mustang.  

A team of six engineers travelled with the special Mustang from Ford's world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, in the United States, to Dubai aboard an Emirates Airlines flight.

Once the car arrived in Dubai, it was transported to the base of Burj Khalifa and carefully separated into six sections that could be transported to the 112th level via the building's lifts. 

The team re-assembled the vehicle over approximately 12 hours. The Burj Khalifa measures 2,717ft.

The re-assembling was complete when Ford executive chairman Bill Ford placed the pony badge on the Mustang on the 112th floor.

It's a city full of tall buildings, yet they are small in comparison to the Burj Khalifa which was graced with a Ford Mustang

At the ceremony in Dubai Mr Ford recalled how, in 1965, the company had placed a 1965 Mustang Convertible atop what was then the world's tallest building - the Empire State Building in New York.

Building on the Burj Khalifa - which includes a hotel, the world's highest nightclub, restaurants and office space - started in September 2004.

It was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the same architecture firm behind the Willis Tower in Chicago and the new One World Trade Center in New York.

After delays the building, surrounded by 27 acres of landscaped gardens, opened on January 4 2010.
