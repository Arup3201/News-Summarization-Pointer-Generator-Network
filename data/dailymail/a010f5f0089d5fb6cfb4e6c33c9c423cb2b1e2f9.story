Distress: Janet Milliken was left 'disturbed' after learning her home was the site of a murder-suicide

A woman has appealed to the state Supreme Court after a home seller and real estate agent allegedly failed to tell her a murder-suicide had taken place in the home they sold her.

When Janet Milliken, 59, moved from California to Thornton, Pennsylvania in 2007, she was unaware that the new house she had bought for $610,000 had been the site of two deaths a year earlier.

Only when she moved in and began chatting to the neighbours did she learn of her new home's grisly past - and the discovery left her disturbed, according to the lawsuit.

She sued the sellers, Joseph and Kathleen Jacono,  and the real estate agent, Re/Max, for fraud and misrepresentation, claiming they deliberately hid what had occurred at the home.

But the trial judge ruled in favour 
of the defendants, saying state law does not require agents to disclose 
such facts, ABC News reported. Last month, the state appeals court agreed with the 
decision.

According to the 
opinion penned by President Judge Emeritus Kate Ford Elliot, sellers are
 only required to identify structural, hazardous and legal impairments 
to a property.

The opinion 
noted the Jaconos and their Realtors sought advice from the Pennsylvania
 Real Estate Commission and were told they did not need to disclose the 
murder-suicide.

'If 
psychological defects must be disclosed, then we are not far from 
requiring sellers to reveal that a next-door neighbor is loud and 
obnoxious, or on some days you can smell a nearby sewage plant, or that 
the house was built on an old Indian burial ground,' the opinion said.

Scene: The Thornton, Pennsylvania home where a man shot his wife before turning the gun on himself

Now Milliken has filed a petition to the Supreme Court of
 Pennsylvania to continue her battle.

Her
 attorney Tim Rayne told ABC News that they want to make the state 
realise 'that having a horrific event occur within a property can be 
just as damaging and troubling to a future homeowner as a physical 
defect, or perhaps even more so.'

He added: 'Having a gunshot 
murder-suicide committed within the home is much more devastating than 
having a small leak concealed by the previous homeowner.

'Physical defects can be fixed. Troubling events that could and did 
occur in this home could never go away.'

The battle stems from February 11, 2006, when Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his wife, then shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the Pickering Trail home, which they owned.

Their three young children were at home at the time, but were not harmed.

On February 11, 2006, 50-year-old Konstantinos Koumboulis shot and killed his 34-year-old wife, Georgia.

He then turned the gun on himself and shot himself dead in the master bedroom of the home, which they owned.

Their three children, aged seven to 13, were at home at the time, but were not harmed.

Police said the eldest child called 911 and the bodies were found around 8.30 a.m.

After authorities arrived on the scene, the children were taken to state police barracks, where they were met by family.

Their home went to auction.

Eight months later the Jaconos, who knew about the killings, bought the home for $450,000 and later sold it to Milliken. She moved in with her two teenage children after her husband's death.

Rayne said Milliken, 59, was 'disturbed' when she found out the history of the home. As she wondered how to tell her children, they learned of the deaths from their friends.

'They were very upset upon learning about it and disturbed about the whole situation,' Rayne said.

'They were dealing with the death of a 
father and husband and wanted to move closer to family, and then this 
happened to them. It was a tragedy all around.'

The family is still living at the home as they cannot afford to move out.

If they were to leave, they would have to tell the new buyers about the home's history 'through good conscience', which would affect the value, Rayne said.

As
 he dissented to December's Superior Court decision, Judge John T. 
Bender acknowledged the massive loss the family had suffered.

'The financial 
penalty Mrs. Milliken has suffered was entirely avoidable had the 
sellers whom she bought her home merely exercised a little more 
integrity and a little less greed,' he said.

But Abraham Reich, the attorney for the Jaconos, said: 'The majority, en banc [full-court] opinion of the Superior Court was well reasoned and consistent with years of industry practice in Pennsylvania.

'The Superior Court opinion provides guidance for any real estate transaction in the future and puts to rest the uncertainty of whether a seller has a duty to disclose a murder-suicide or any other type "psychological damage". In my opinion, the result is a good one.'
