Fashion house Lanvin has called upon some of fashion's most iconic style stars for its latest womenswear campaign, which sees the industry veterans posing alongside their equally-photogenic offspring.

The Spring 2015 campaign stars the likes of former Karl Lagerfeld muse Pat Cleveland, 62, who poses with her lookalike daughter Anna, 80s fashion icon Violetta Sanchez and her daughter Luz Godin, and Prada model Kirsten Owen, 44, who is featured alongside her daughter Billie Rose.

'I like that the campaign doesn't only have images, it has a story,' Lanvin creative director Alber Elbaz told WWD.com of his decision to feature the fashion-focused family members in his campaign. 

Like mother, like daughter: 80s fashion icon turned actress Violetta Sanchez poses alongside her 15-year-old daughter Luz 

Blonde bombshells: 44-year-old Kirsten Owen and her daughter Billie Rose are the only mother daughter duo not to be featured in all-black ensembles

Spot the difference: Both Pat Cleveland and her daughter Anna have the same high cheekbones

'Every time we do a family shoot, it feels like we're going to their place; we feel like visitors.'

In each of the ad campaigns, the mother and daughter duos are dressed in near-identical ensembles, modeling a variety of bold hairstyles and posing with the kind of intimate familiarity that can only be found among close-knit family members.

Speaking to AnOthermag.com, model turned actress Violetta, who also walked in Alber Elbaz's Lanvin 125th anniversary show, explained that her career has been as much a part of her 15-year-old daughter Luz's life as it has her own.

'She has seen me all my life modelling and acting and curating,' she said. 

'She knows modelling doesn’t have to be restrictive. She knows it is something she wants to do but not only. It’s also how you survive.'

Family ties: Pat and Anna have modeled together in the past when they starred alongside one another in Zac Posen's Resort 2014 lookbook

In good hands: The campaign was shot by renowned fashion photographer Tim Walker

And while this campaign is thought to be Luz's first fashion campaign, the other two young women featured have both tried their hands at modeling in the past - both with and without their mothers. 

In Spring 2013, Billie Rose posed in a series of stunning images, some of which featured her mother Kirsten, while others featured her alone, for Flare magazine.

Meanwhile Pat and her daughter Anna, 25, starred together in Zac Posen's Resort 2014 lookbook in June 2013.

And Lanvin continues its exploration of familial bonds in its menswear campaign, calling on the talents of sibling style stars Callum and Haydn Rockall, as well as DJ partners Joshua Quinton and Andy Bradin.

The four men feature both as a group and in a variety on separate ads, which sees them posing as pairs. 

Let's hear it for the boys! Lanvin's new menswear campaign also explores the idea of family bonds and features sibling style stars Callum and Haydn Rockall, as well as DJ partners Joshua Quinton and Andy Bradin

Music maestros: Josh, 24, and Andy, 22, have previously performed for the likes of Kate Moss, Miley Cyrus and Riccardo Tisci

Budding style stars: Josh and Andy (L) have appeared in a number of high profile fashion publications in the past, while Callum and Haydn are known as some of the industry's hottest up-and-comers

Josh, 24, and Andy, 22, who DJ together under the name Disco Smack, showcase their infamous orange-red hairstyles while modeling a collection of smartly-tailored jackets and trousers. 

While the duo, who have performed at a number of celebrity events, from Riccardo Tisci's recent birthday party in Ibiza to Kate Moss' 40th, are not thought to have worked on any other fashion campaigns in the past, they boast an impressive amount of posing experience thanks to a series of high-profile spreads in the world's top magazines.

Callum and Haydn meanwhile, are thought of as two of the industry's hottest up-and-comers, a label which has no doubt been cemented thanks to their appearance in this campaign. 

Shot by renowned fashion photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with the likes of Cara Delevingne for Mulberry, and siblings Dakota and Elle Fanning for W Magazine, the campaign is set to debut in print in March.
