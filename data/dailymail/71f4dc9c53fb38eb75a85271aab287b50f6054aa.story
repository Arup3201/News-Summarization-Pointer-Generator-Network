This horrifying footage serves as a reminder of the deadly potential of one of the world's fastest sports cars.

Three people died when a Ferrari 599 GTO ploughed into the side of a taxi while speeding across a city centre junction in Singapore.

The Ferrari driver was killed instantly, while the cab driver and his passenger died a short time later.

High speed: The Ferrari 599 GTO appears as little more than a red blur as it ploughs into the side of a blue taxi

Horror: The violent force of the red supercar sends the two vehicles flying out of shot

Father of three: Taxi driver Cheng Teck Hock, 52, died

A passenger in the rare red supercar survived and was taken to hospital, as did a motorcyclist who was also involved.

Police gave no official estimate as to how fast the Ferrari was moving, but the extremely high speed of the collision is plain to see from the video.

Officers are investigating the crash but, as Motor Authority reports, witnesses claim 31-year-old businessman Ma Chi ran a red light before slamming into the blue taxi.

The smash was captured by the dash camera of another car at the point where Rochor Road meets Victoria Street, said to be an accident blackspot in the centre of the southeast Asian city-state.

A 20-year-old female passenger died in the taxi, with the Straits Times naming her driver as 52-year-old father of three Cheng Teck Hock.

He suffered major brain injuries and died in intensive care at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital earlier this month.
