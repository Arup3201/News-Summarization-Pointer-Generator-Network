Chelsea's £200million men were sunk by a supermarket shelf stacker who was plucked from non-League obscurity for the princely sum of £7,500.

James Hanson was the only member of the Bradford City squad at Stamford Bridge to cost a fee, decided in a tribunal, after his move from Guiseley in 2009.

The rest of Phil Parkinson’s parade of heroes were stitched together by a mixture of free transfers and low-key loan deals.

In contrast the total cost of Jose Mourinho’s shocked stars clanged the £200m mark.

Even £99m of talent on the bench alone could not rescue Mourinho from the most embarrassing moment of his managerial career as the Bantams proved worth their weight in gold.

The thrilling win sent Bradford’s 6,000 travelling fans at Stamford Bridge into dreamland and Parkinson hopes another glamorous tie awaits.

‘If Man United get through against Cambridge, I’d love to have a go at them,’ he said.

‘I’m sure if we went to Old Trafford, we’d have 15,000 fans there. It was like a home game in the second-half and I’m just so pleased for every one of them.’
