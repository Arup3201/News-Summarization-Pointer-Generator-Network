Unemployed mother-of-two Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, last year caused uproar by saying she felt taxpayers should give her more benefits to eat healthily. But she now admits she got it wrong 

Last year, an obese mother-of-two on benefits caused a media storm after claiming she needed more taxpayers money in order to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle. 

Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, told This Morning in September that she hated being 25 stone but she couldn't do anything about it because she can only afford junk food and doesn't have enough cash for a gym membership. 

But after spending three weeks with a dietitian, Christina has done a complete U-turn and now admits that she was 'stupid' to think that it is expensive to eat well. 

After overhauling her diet by limiting processed foods and loading up on with fresh fruit and vegetables, Christina  has both lost 1st 5lbs and saved cash.

Now weighing 23st 9lbs, Christina returned to the ITV programme earlier today to show off her weight loss. 

She said: 'I feel a lot healthier. My back doesn't hurt anymore when I walk.

'I'm really determined now. 

'I've bought myself a FitBit and I go out for a walk each morning and evening.'

Christina, who is unemployed, rarely left the house until recently, but she now walks around 20,000 steps a day. 

Her improved lifestyle isn't hurting her bank balance either - she revealed today that she often walks out of the supermarket with change from her £40 weekly food budget.

Christina confessed: 'I was stupid thinking it's expensive when it's not.'

'At first I did find it hard but the more I get into it, I'm finding it easier and easier.

'The kids love the food. They love coming to help in the kitchen, especially my daughter Helena.

Christina was given three weeks personalised advice from expert dietitian Evelyn Toner (pictured right)

After Christina appeared on This Morning, the show's producers arranged for dietitian Evelyn Toner to visit her Wigan home to analyse her weekly shop. 

Christina's weekly haul of crisps, biscuits, white bread and microwave meals totalled just £35 and she is seen telling Evelyn: 'This is what the government don't understand. Unhealthy food is actually a lot cheaper.'

Christina then tries a healthy supermarket shop; but she ends up with a bill of £140, drastically over budget.

However, dietitian Evelyn then shows Christina how to do a shop for her family of four for just £38, by planning meals ahead and bulk cooking.

Evelyn provided a list of meals for Christina to chose from, including pizza using wholemeal pitta bread, homemade spaghetti Bolognese and homemade chicken in breadcrumbs with oven baked potato wedges

Christina also enrolled in a 'Food Positive' programme to help her learn how to cook from scratch. She said: 'I've learnt that by budgeting healthy food, you can do it. I didn't need all that food in my trolley every week.'

Christina lost 10lbs in the three-week experiment and has continued to follow Evelyn's diet plan, losing a further 10lbs so far.

Tips like being taught the correct portion control have helped Christina lose over a stone

Her new attitude is a marked change to her first appearance on This Morning when she claimed she needed more money from the government in order to improve her health. 

Weighing 25st and at a size 26, the single mother told Closer Magazine: 'It's not easy being overweight and on benefits. If I was well off, I'd be able to buy fresh food and afford a gym membership.

'I tried swimming but it cost £22 a month and it meant I had to cut back on my favourite pizza and Chinese takeaways.'

Unemployed Christina gets £20,000 in benefits a year and lives in a council house with her two children by different fathers, Helena, 10, and Robert, two.
