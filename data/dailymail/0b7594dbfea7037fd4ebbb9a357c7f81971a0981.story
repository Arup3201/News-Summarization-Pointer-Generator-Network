Hollywood is going back to tried and tested formulas after a series of major film flops at the box office.

A record 31 sequels and 17 reboots are being lined up in 2013 as producers and studios play it safe with cinema audiences.

There will be a a sixth X-men movie, Fast and Furious 6, Die Hard 5, Scary Movie 5, and Paranormal Activity 5, it was reported in the Daily Telegraph.

For Hangover and Iron Man fans there are third instalments while Bad Santa, The Smurfs and GI Joe are all  expected back on the big screen.

The Superman franchise gets a reboot in Man of Steel with new versions of The Evil Dead, Mad Max and another Star Trek movie, Into The Darkness, featuring the young Captain Kirk and Mr Spock again.

A series of box office disasters in 2012 has prompted the caution by the moneymen in Hollywood. 

John Carter, based on the book A princess of Mars, bombed with Disney taking a £123 million write-off, forcing the resignation of studio chairman Rich Ross.

Universal Picture's $200 million science fiction film Battleship starring singer Rihanna flopped as did another sci-fi movie Cloud Atlas with the usually bankable Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.

A $20 million budgeted children's film, The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure, recouped just $1 million.

Keith Simanton, managing editor of Internet Movie Database told the Telegraph's Nick Allen: 'At the end of the day you go with what you know because the audience seems to go with what they know.

'There were a lot of big gambles this year that didn't come off. It was almost like the public is making them pay the price for that. It's not a new lesson but it's a more costly lesson.'

Franchise movies have led the way this year with Avengers - an ensemble of cartoon characters like Iron Man, Thor and Captain America - proving a massive hit with cinema fans.

Liam Neeson's Taken 2 was condemned as 'ham-handed and laughable' by one critic, but reportedly took $365 million with a budget of $45 million. Hangover 2 grossed $580 million more than the first saucy comedy.
