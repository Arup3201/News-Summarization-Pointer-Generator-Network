Young pupils at an exclusive prep school have been told they must improve their manners after failing their headteacher's 'Politeness Challenge'.

Boys at Wetherby Prep School in Notting Hill, London, were sent home for their Easter holidays with a ticking off by headmaster Nick Baker, who wrote in his his blog to parents that some pupils had 'lost focus' when it came to being polite.

The children at the private school, formed as a sister school to Wetherby Pre-Prep where Princes William and Harry were pupils, were set the challenge of improving their manners after Mr Baker spotted two students being rude.

Minding their manners: Young pupils at exclusive Wetherby Prep School have been told they must improve their manners after failing their headteacher's 'Politeness Challenge'

'I witnessed some pretty poor behaviour from a couple of normally
 incredibly polite and considerate boys this week,' he had written in January.

'It was not directed 
at a teacher or another boy in the school, but directed towards their 
driver and nanny, respectively. 

'I really was taken aback by the way 
that these boys spoke and their lack of respect towards an adult.'

Mr Baker said the incident had prompted him to set up the Politeness Challenge at the £16,935 a year school, telling parents they had his full support when it came to disciplining their children if they were rude to family members.

In his latest letter to parents, Mr Baker said that his initiative had improved standards of manners and courtesy in the school, and that both visitors and staff had been impressed with the politeness exhibited by pupils, who are aged between four and eight.

But he said that the boys had not fully met the criteria of the challenge, and therefore it would continue into the summer term.

'The 
instantaneous improvement that we witnessed earlier in the school year 
has dissipated somewhat,' he wrote. 

'Therefore, we are rolling over to next term. 

'I
 hate ending the term on a low point but I am sure you will agree that 
this is an important area that we cannot simply cave into or one in 
which we should be too liberal with our praise.'

In February, Education secretary Michael Gove claimed the Thomas Jones primary school in West London, where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language offers a better education than Wetherby.

In a speech to the London Academy of 
Excellence, Mr Gove said the evidence shows ‘beyond any reasonable 
doubt’ that English state education is starting to show a ‘sustained and
 significant improvement’.

He
 said state schools could become the best in the world by tapping into 
the expertise of the independent sector, claiming that Wetherby school 
in particular may already have been overtaken by nearby state schools 
teaching much poorer pupils.

He said: ‘There are state primary schools every bit as ambitious, as supportive, as exciting, as the smartest of private prep schools.

‘Like, for example, Thomas Jones primary in West London – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years, a majority coming from homes where English is not their first language – which is just as good, if not better, than the pre-eminent London prep - Wetherby school - just a mile or so away.

‘Under the changes we're making, it’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools.

‘Instead of reinforcing the Berlin Wall between state and private, as the current Labour leadership appear to want, we should break it down.’

Responding to Mr Gove's comments in his blog, Mr Baker said: 'I have no knowledge of the school they referred to but I am delighted 
that it is doing so well and is thriving.  

'The Education Secretary 
often makes many newsworthy comments and, at the very least, it gets 
people discussing education. 

William and Harry both attended the pre-prep school in Notting Hill in the 1980s before taking up places at Ludgrove School in Berkshire and later Eton.

Other former Wetherby pre-prep pupils include Downing Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, composer Lord Lloyd Webber and actor Hugh Grant.
