Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 

1. Santi Cazorla was unquestionably man of the match in Arsenal’s 2-0 win at Manchester City, but the Gunners’ unsung hero was centre-forward Olivier Giroud.

The Frenchman’s work rate set the tone for his team, harrying City’s defenders and making himself available as an outlet when Arsenal broke.

Giroud ran 7.4 miles, the furthest of any player on the Etihad Stadium pitch – and in marked contrast to opposing front man Sergio Aguero’s total of 5.8 miles.

For good measure he also headed home the second goal that clinched the game – his seventh of an injury hit season in which he was starting for only the eighth time.

2. West Ham will feel more and more confident of regularly selling the 54,000 seats in their new Olympic Stadium home.

Sunday’s official gate of 34,914 for the 3-0 romp over Hull was just 102 below Upton Park’s official capacity, a significant crowd for a game that was live on TV and against one of the Premier League’s less glamorous clubs.

The Hammers, who move to Stratford in 2016, have sold out all 11 of their Premier League home games so far.

3. Angel Di Maria is unquestionably a brilliant wide man but he can’t play as a central striker in the way Louis van Gaal tried to use him in the first half at Queens Park Rangers.

The slightly built Argentine didn’t have the strength to hold the ball up. He gave it away 22 times at Loftus Road and won only three of 14 duels against defenders.

4. Southampton’s astonishing production line of academy talent never seems to stop producing players – the latest is 19-year-old Harrison Reed who helped manager Ronald Koeman make light of the absence of his key midfield pair Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin.

Worthing-born Reed gave the ball away only eight times in 90 minutes at Newcastle, and came out on top in every one of the four tackles he contested.

It helped Koeman’s side wrap up three away wins in a week – taking them to 10 wins on their travels in all this season, the most the club have ever achieved in a Premier League campaign.

5. Aston Villa are hoping that new Spanish midfielder Carles Gil can provide the attacking verve from midfield they need – and that his debut was a sign of things to come.

The 22-year-old livened up another drab Villa display after replacing Tom Cleverley with half an hour to go.

In his time on the pitch he played more passes, won more tackles and made more chances than on-loan Manchester United and former England star Cleverley had managed in the previous 60 minutes. He also ran 2.8 miles – two thirds of the total distance covered in half the time compared to Cleverley.

6. Glenn Whelan, who celebrated his 31st birthday last week, is out of contract in the summer and has yet to agree a new deal at Stoke because the club prefer not to give more than 12 months to players in their thirties.

The Republic of Ireland midfielder is making a strong case to be treated as an exception to the rule, though.

He made the team tick in the 1-0 win at Leicester, completing more passes (64) than anybody else, with two thirds of them in the attacking half. Steven N’ Zonzi and Bojan were the only two Stoke players who ran further than his 6.9 miles.

7. Perhaps Whelan could give a call for some support to his Irish team-mate John O’Shea, who will be 34 in April but signed in October a contract that keeps him at Sunderland until the summer of 2017.

The central defender is proof that age need be no barrier to playing in the Premier League.

After Whelan’s team-mate Ryan Shawcross was ruled out by injury on Saturday, O’Shea is now the only top flight outfield player this season to have appeared for every minute of every game in every competition.

8. Welsh international midfielder Dave Edwards was one of the few players to survive the massive clearout undertaken by Kenny Jackett when he took over at Wolves – and is beginning to look a key figure in the club’s ambition to return to the Premier League.

The 28-year-old scored his fourth goal in three games in the 2-0 win over Blackpool that moved the Molineux club to within a point of the Championship play-offs.

9. Swindon, where manager Mark Cooper insists on expansive passing football, are establishing a reputation as the destination of choice for Premier League clubs to send their most promising youngsters for loan spells.

The latest to arrive at the Country Ground is Chelsea’s 19-year-old John Swift, a Portsmouth born midfielder whose goal-scoring at youth level has led to him being dubbed the next Frank Lampard.

He lived up to the reputation, scoring one and making another as the Robins beat Chesterfield 3-1 to stay top of the League One table.

10. Cameron McGeehan is a name that Manchester United will need to be aware of before they arrive at Cambridge on Friday night for a potentially tricky FA Cup fourth round tie.

The 19-year-old, who started out at Fulham and then Chelsea before being let go, has just signed for Richard Money’s team on a loan from his current club Norwich.

The Northern Ireland Under 21 international has been cleared to play against Louis van Gaal’s side – and warmed up with two goals on his Abbey Stadium debut in a 4-0 romp against Newport.
