‘The person who is helping him was from the club while the detectives were helping as well. The prince is smiling and he looked very happy and as he had a very good time out with friends.’

Earlier, Harry had paid tribute along with his brother William to their childhood friend Henry van Straubenzee, who died aged 18 in a car crash 12 years ago, at a carol service.

The service, held in front of 800 guests at St Luke's and Christ Church in Chelsea - just a short walk from Raffles - took place last night to raise money for a memorial fund set up in their friend’s name.

Harry, who was in the same class at school as Mr van Straubenzee, entertained the congregation yesterday as he described sharing childhood escapades during his teenage years.
