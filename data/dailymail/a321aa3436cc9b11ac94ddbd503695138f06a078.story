A pair of teenage vandals were literally caught red-handed - using red spray paint to deface a New York war memorial. 

Police stopped 17-year-old Mike Kushnir and his 15-year-old female friend in the act and cuffed them both - despite Kushnir trying to escape on his skateboard.

The pair had scrawled lewd graffiti all over the 114-year-old Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Monument on Riverside Drive and West 89th Street, including swear words, crude faces and their own names.

Officers patrolling the area were able to respond quickly to a 911 call at at about 3.20am on Thursday, and the vandals were caught by Sgt. Nathaniel Herman and Officer Carmen Ledesma. 

'When responding to a graffiti call, the suspects are usually long gone when you get there,' Sgt. Herman told New York Daily News. 'But this time we got them, literally, red-handed.'

As Kushnir tried to flee from the officers, Sgt. Herman noticed the tell-tale red paint on his skateboard, and the same paint was also found on his friend's left arm.

Crude: The two teenagers were arrested and charged for scrawling their names and strange designs

Both were arrested and charged with multiple counts of felony and criminal mischief, and were also linked to and charged for previous instances of graffiti. The girl was charged as a juvenile.

Kushnir was charged with scrawling the word 'trap' on a lamppost at the corner of Riverside Drive and West 88th Street in May, while the girl was charged with writing her initials on a mailbox back in March.

Some of the graffiti was very high up the monument, and could have only been done by climbing up it.

It included spirals, smiley faces and the words: 'In God we don't trust'.

Building on the marble Civil War memorial began in 1900 and the structure was officially unveiled on Memorial Day in 1902 at a ceremony officiated by President Theodore Roosevelt.

The Greek-style, columned monument is around 29 metres tall and has a bronze door at the base, which used to be open to the public.

It was named a city landmark in 1976 and a state landmark in 2001. 

Police say there has been a four per cent rise in graffiti crime since this time last year, up from 1,042 to 1,080 incidents.
