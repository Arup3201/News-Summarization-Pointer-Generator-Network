Jimmy Savile's former personal assistant has likened the predatory paedophile to 'Peter Pan', saying he was 'forever surrounding himself with youngsters'.

After claiming earlier this week that Savile's alleged victims were 'jumping on the bandwagon' for money, she has now admitted she could have been duped by the star.

Janet Cope, 70, was the former TV 
presenter's PA for 32 years, until she was suddenly sacked by him in 
2001. The pair were so close he even gave her away at her wedding in 
1990.

In a turnaround, she told the Daily Mirror: 'He was eccentric, manipulative, controlling. I was frightened to death of him and I wasn’t the only one. He loved the power he had over people.'

'He thought he was untouchable because he was hand in glove with the hospitals, royalty and the Prime Minister.'

She added: 'He was like Peter Pan, forever surrounding himself with youngsters. It was his elixir.'

Savile cruelly fired Mrs Cope without her warning during a meeting with doctors and administrators at Stoke Mandeville hospital in 2001.

Originally, after hearing the claims he was a child abuser, she stuck by her friend, claiming that people had become 'fanciful' and suggested victims had made the claims up.

She suggested that Savile was often pictured with young women because it helped preserve his youthful image.

Mrs Cope spoke out after another one of the Jim'll Fix It presenter's victims came forward.

His former paperboy said he was 15-years-old when Savile invited him into his flat to give a £40 Christmas bonus and told him, 'Now you've got to really earn it'.

The man, who does not want to be named, told The Sun that Savile pulled down his jeans and molested him, before the presenter then pulled down his own trousers and underpants.

Luckily, he managed to escape from his apartment block in Roundhay, Leeds. He said: 'He would have raped me if I hadn't got out of there.'

He had been delivering papers to Savile's block for almost a year when the attack happened in Christmas 1975.

He said: 'He started kissing the back of my neck and said, "You've got to earn this," and pressed me against the door and tried to have sex with me'. The boy quit his round the following month.

He is the fourth male victim to come forward in the wake of the scandal.

The news comes as it was announced that former High Court 
judge Dame Janet Smith and ex-Sky News executive Nick Pollard are to 
lead the BBC’s independent reviews stemming from the sex abuse 
allegations surrounding the late DJ.

Dame
Janet, who led the inquiry into mass killer Harold Shipman, will lead 
the examination of the 'culture and practices of the BBC' during the 
years Savile worked there.

Mr Pollard, a former head of Sky News, will look into whether there were any 'failings' in the way a Newsnight investigation into claims against Savile was handled.

The planned news report was dropped late last year and there have been repeated suggestions the decision was made because the BBC was already planning to do more favourable programmes, claims which the BBC has repeatedly denied.

Dame Janet's review will include evidence from people who have made allegations about being sexually abused by Savile on BBC premises or while on location for the corporation.

Police believe the DJ and television presenter’s alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades and included about 60 victims.
