Thousands of families whose homes were damaged in the storms that battered Britain in January have yet to receive insurance payouts, with many still in temporary accommodation.

In February, Prime Minister David Cameron put insurers on notice that they needed to ‘pay up the money fast’.

Yet 7,480 households – 40 per cent of those who made claims – are still waiting for compensation, according to Association of British Insurers (ABI) figures. These also show that 2,600 will still be waiting at Christmas. On the Somerset Levels, an estimated 100 families are still in temporary accommodation – often campers and caravans.

Angela Bidmead, 64, and Den Cox, 67, have just started sleeping back at their house but still have to cook and wash in a caravan. Miss Bidmead said: ‘It has been horrendous. For ages I woke each morning crying.’

Mother-of-two Bryony Sadler, 39, hopes to return to her Victorian rectory in the Levels next month. ‘There are so many undecided issues and nobody will take a decision,’ she said. ‘Mr Cameron may have told insurers to pay up fast but obviously they weren’t listening.’

Gillie Bolton, 66, and her husband Jim Wanamaker, 69, have had to move temporary homes three times since being evacuated from their bungalow in Windsor.

She said: ‘We had refurbished the whole house before the floods. We are resilient people but this has almost destroyed us. My husband is suffering from cancer and we’re both on anti-depressants.’

Windsor MP Adam Afriyie said: ‘Insurance companies must settle claims quickly.’

The ABI admits it does not know the exact number living in temporary accommodation.

Insurers say not all outstanding claims are disputed and many involve residents who have already returned home.

They believe 85 per cent of the 18,700 claims submitted will be settled by the New Year.
