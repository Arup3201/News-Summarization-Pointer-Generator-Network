A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point' experts have today warned, as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target.

A new report by the Nuffield Trust said an 'undue' focus on the national target can 'distort' behaviour inside hospitals 'in ways that are not in the interests of patients or staff'.

Focus on the target can mean a significant amount of time is spent by staff reporting up the chain to those who commission healthcare, and regulators, with a potentially detrimental impact on the quality of care. 

The think tank's critique  What's Behind The A&E 'Crisis'? comes as NHS England reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in England since July 2013.

It comes as the latest figures, published today, show performance is getting worse.

In the week ending March 1, 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target.

It marks a slight fall from the previous week, when performance was 92 per cent. 

But authors of the Nuffield Trust report argue that while the four-hour target has 'played an important part in improving patients' experiences', it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care. 

The report argues a set of 'richer performance indicators' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures.

Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, and the report's co-author, warned: 'England's A&E system is near crisis.

'With the financial squeeze set to continue, there is no relief in sight if we keep up the current approach. 

'We need to rethink our assumptions as many of the "magic bullet" solutions suggested miss the point.

'It's not about more people turning up, but about a system with a squeeze on hospital space and staff, which needs to get better at discharging people safely and on time.'  

Every minute of every day, an average of 40 patients arrive at emergency departments in England.

The speed with which people move through A&E 'has come to be regarded as a sentinel marker of the health care system'.

The chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Mark Porter, agreed, adding the four-hour wait has become 'disproportionate'.

Responding to the Nuffield Trust briefing, he said: 'Doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need, rather than an arbitrary target. 

'Moving away from a system that prioritises targets above all else to one which takes a wider view of how services are performing would improve the quality of patient care by preventing rushed admissions, or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment.

95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital.

92 per cent – average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014.

Three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E.

Two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E.

More than one hour, four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75.

'By fixating on one narrow measurement, we risk focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes of rising pressure on A&Es, which are linked to wider pressures across the NHS and social care sector.

'Cuts to social care mean hospitals have become a holding place for many older patients who can’t be discharged because there is simply nowhere for them to go. 

'This ‘exit block’ leads to bed shortages and patients waiting for hours on trolleys to be admitted. Outside of hospitals investment in general practice is declining while demand is on the rise and more care is moved into the community - this simply isn’t sustainable.

'We can only get to grips with pressure on A&Es if we look at health and social care in the round, and ensure every part of the system is fully resourced and working well.' 

Focus on A&E performance has intensified since the start of the year, as 'unprecedented' winter pressures saw medics face a worsening situation.

In January figures revealed A&E waiting times had plummeted to the lowest level in a decade.

But the authors of the Nuffield Trust report point out A&E is only part of a broader urgent care system.

GP practices, out-of-hours services and the telephone service NHS 111 all have key parts to play. 

The four-hour target counts the patients who spend a total of less than 240 minutes between arrival and leaving the department, having been either discharged or admitted to an inpatient bed in another part of the hospital.

The authors said: 'The target has played an important part in improving patients' experiences of care at A&E.

'Before the target was introduced, 12-hour waits were not uncommon.'

When the benchmark was first introduced in 2004, performance began to rise.

In 2005-06 the target, then of seeing 98 per cent of patients within four hours, was met for the first time.

In 2010, the expectation was relaxed slightly, with the target lowered to 95 per cent of patients who should be treated and discharged or admitted within four hours. 

The report notes a range of pressures placed on A&E departments, but states the most significant issue  'is not the numbers of people presenting at A&E, but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole'

The pressure on the urgent care system is caused by high bed occupancy rates, tight resources and staff facing increasing strain, the report states.

'There is no doubt that the system is near breaking point,' they wrote.

But there are other signs of the impending crisis, which will be accelerated by the 'continued financial squeeze'.

The number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours before being admitted to hospital has almost trebled, and delayed ambulance handovers at the doors of A&E have risen by more than 70 per cent.

The think tank highlight the latest problems in A&E 'are part of a well-established decline since 2012'.

But they argue the picture is not as straightforward.

A&E ‘waiting’ time 

The length of time a patient spends in the A&E department between being seen by A&E staff and either being admitted or discharged. Unlike other NHS waiting times, this is not the length of time a person waits before they are treated.

Attendance

Any visit to A&E, whether it results in an admission or discharge. The average cost to the NHS is £124 per attendance.

Admission

What happens to a patient who is transferred from A&E into another ward within the hospital for further treatment. The average cost to the NHS: £1,657 per admission.

Discharge

What happens when a patient leaves A&E to go either home or to an outpatient clinic.

Traditional arguments have blamed the pressure on A&E with a rising tide of patients arriving at the doors of emergency departments.

The report however, noted 'attendance has not risen much beyond what we would expect because of population change'. 

Furthermore fingers have been pointed at the impact of the NHS 111 phone line, cuts to social care and changes to the GP contract in 2004, which gave family doctors the option to opt out of providing out-of-hours care.

Instead, the most significant issue facing A&E units across the country 'is not the numbers of people presenting at A&E, but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole'.

That, the authors argue, is stemming the flow of patients through the hospital system from the front door back to their homes, or rehabilitation in the community. 

The briefing recommends that many answers to the current situation already exist.

The authors recommend policy makers should take a longer-term and broader view of performance in A&E, introducing a more complex set of indicators to sit alongside the four-hour waiting target.

'The complexity of the system and the highly politicised nature of the A&E have impeded progress,' the authors said.

'Problems will not be solved if policy-makers, political leaders and regulators continue to micro-manage A&E.

'With change so urgently needed, it is imperative that there is a cross-party consensus on how to move forward and that action is not postponed or delayed for political reasons.'  

A spokesman for NHS England said: 'This report makes some important suggestions about how the NHS could respond to winter pressures.

'We are already undertaking a number of the actions that the Nuffield Trust suggest - for example improving access to care outside hospitals, encouraging local health leaders to identify where to focus investment and using a richer range of different data indicators so we better understand how pressures are affecting different parts of the system.

'We also recognise the need for more fundamental change, so we welcome contributions such as this that will help us to identify how we can work more efficiently and drive up standards of care across the country.'
