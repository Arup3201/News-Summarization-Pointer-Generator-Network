The Imitation Game star, 29, who is currently expecting her first child with husband James Righton, has beaten Kate, 33, to the top spot in a vote for the most stylish mother-to-be.

Keira took more than a quarter of votes in the poll by carried out by My1stYears.com.

Women voted for Keira after she's impressively dressed her baby bump on the red carpet recently in a number of designer gowns.  

The Oscar-nominated actress, whose pregnancy has fallen during the busy awards season, admitted her blossoming baby bump has meant she's had to ditch her usual slim-fitting dresses in favour of floaty gowns.

The actress said of the Chanel gown she wore to the Golden Globes: 'The waistline goes up somewhat. There is no waist any more, so it's risen.'

One woman who took part in the survey said: 'I love Keira's designer maternity wear, she always looks really stylish. I'm sure she is the envy of pregnant women everywhere - who wouldn't want to wear Chanel everyday?'

In the poll of 600 women, Kate came in a close second place with 20 per cent of the vote.

She's due to give birth to her second child with Prince William this April and has attended a number of public events recently thanks to her morning sickness abating.

The Duchess drew admiration for her maternity style during her first pregnancy with Prince George when she favoured clothes from High Street store Seraphine.

Staying stylish while pregnant is no easy task. And as much as you may want to be on trend and put together, sometimes the need for comfort just overtakes the desire to work an edgy look.

If you're expecting and need a bit of inspiration for how to dress your bump then look no further than the Duchess of Cambridge. This is one woman who somehow manages to remain completely herself and look chic despite her changing shape.

Last week Kate was spotted in a dress by one of her favourite high street labels, Hobbs, but today she stuck to specialist maternity wear with this very pretty pale blue coat by Seraphine. It's a brand she's worn before, both before and after the birth of Prince George and this candy colored confection is perfect for lightening up her wardrobe on a dark wintry day.

Her £95 floral dress is also by the brand who have been a favourite of hers during both her pregnancies

She's stuck to wearing clothing from the brand during her second pregnancy, most recently by wearing a pale blue £195 coat over a £95 floral dress by the brand to a visit to a leisure centre in Kensington. 

She also wore a purple coat from Seraphine as she wrapped her baby bump during her visit to New York with William at the end of last year.

'All of the mums-to-be who made the top ten pull off maternity wear very well so we're looking forward to seeing their stylish offspring's outfits too.'
