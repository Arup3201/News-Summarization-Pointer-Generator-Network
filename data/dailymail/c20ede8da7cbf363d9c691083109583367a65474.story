This is the shocking moment paramedics were called to treat a Chinese man after a thick metal bar impaled his head while he was carrying out DIY work at his former home.

The man, identified only as Mr Ho, was dismantling the property in Leye County, Guangxi Province, when a large metal bar fell from above - impaling the right side of his forehead and exiting through the left side of his jaw.

Miraculously Mr Ho, 50, survived his dramatic injury and, following successful emergency surgery at a nearby hospital, is now expected to make a full recovery.

Horrific: Paramedics were called to treat Mr Ho after a thick metal bar impaled the right side of his forehead and exited through the left side of his jaw while he was carrying out DIY work at his former home

Lucky: X-rays taken before surgery showed how the solid metal bar, which was at least an inch thick, passed through the right side of his forehead and behind his left eye socket

Paramedics called to treat Mr Ho were shocked to discover the nature of his gruesome injury - but were more amazed by the fact he was not only alive, but also fully conscious and relatively lucid.

Mr Ho was rushed to the nearby Leye County Hospital, where doctors were forced to called in firefighters with specialist cutting equipment to remove the bulk of the metal bar.

They were then able to transfer him to a larger hospital where complex emergency surgery was carried out to remove the section of metal still embedded deep inside his head.

Hospital staff say Mr Ho is now recovering well and is considered to be out of danger.

X-rays taken before surgery showed 
how the solid metal bar, which was at least an inch thick, passed 
through the right side of his forehead and behind his left eye socket, 
before eventually exiting through the lower section of his left cheek, 
close to his jawline.

Rescue: Had the thick metal bar entered at a fractionally different angle, it would have almost certainly penetrated Mr Ho's brain or eyeball, causing serious injury or death

Miraculous: Mr Ho, 50, survived his dramatic injury. Following successful emergency surgery at nearby Leigh County Hospital (pictured), he is now expected to make a full recovery

Drama: The metal bar had fallen from above Mr Ho while he was dismantling his former property in Leye County in China's southern Guangxi Province

Had 
the bar entered at a fractionally different angle, it would have almost 
certainly penetrated Mr Ho's brain or eyeball, causing serious injury or
 death.

The news comes as, elsewhere in southern China, a driver chatting on her mobile phone decapitated her mother in a freak accident when she smashed into a motorway crash barrier.

Horrified Wang Wei watched as the barrier entered through the grille of her car, passed through the dashboard and then went straight into her mother's head as she sat in the front passenger seat.

Witness Fai Yao said: 'The car was impaled on the barrier prong like a kebab... It hit the poor woman straight in the head at very high speed. She didn't have a chance.'

Police say victim Wang Chiu, 68, died instantly in the crash in Chongqing city in south-west China.
