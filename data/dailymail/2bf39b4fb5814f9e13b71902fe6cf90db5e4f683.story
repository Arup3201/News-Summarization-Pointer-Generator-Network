Normally the drama happens on the stage, not in the wings.

Not so in Covent Garden, where opera director Laurent Pelly has swapped the leading lady in his production of Giacomo Meyerbeer's epic opera Robert le diable just three days before opening night.

American singer Jennifer Rowley has been dismissed in favour of Italian soprano Patrizia Ciofi, who flew in to London from Paris only yesterday to take over the role of Princess Isabelle.

The decision was made during the final rehearsals, and an official ROH statement explained it was based on a 'mutual' belief that  the role of Isabelle would 'not be right' for Rowley's Covent Garden debut.

The last minute swap follows a spate of disruptive cast changes: Rowley was herself a replacement for original casting of Isabelle, German soprano Diana Damrau, who was forced to leave the production in June when she fell pregnant.

The role of Princess Isablelle will now be played by Patrizia Ciofi, right, on all nights in Covent Garden apart from the final two, 18 and 21 Decmber, when Russian singer Sofia Romina will take over part

The opera is a supernatural romance set within the courts of medieval France.

Ciofi will play Isablle on all 
performances apart from 18 and 21 December when he role will be 
performed by Russian Sofia Romina, herself a newcomer to the Royal Opera House.

The Royal Opera House explained: 
'After much deliberation and consultation following the final rehearsals
 of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, it has been agreed between The Royal 
Opera and soprano Jennifer Rowley that the role of Isabelle would not be
 the right part for her debut at Covent Garden. 

'The Royal Opera considers Jennifer Rowley an important voice of the 
future, and we are keen to build a continued relationship with her.

'However, voices do develop, and we have to recognize that this role is 
not ideally suited for her now more dramatic voice.

'Despite all efforts 
until the last minute by all parties to make it work as well as 
possible, it has been mutually agreed that Jennifer Rowley will not 
appear in Robert le diable and will postpone her Covent Garden debut.

'The Royal Opera is proud to announce that it has been agreed that she 
will return in 2015 in her celebrated role of Musetta in La bohème, and 
another important role is under discussion for the future.'

As well as the commotion surrounding the role of Isabelle, Marina Poplavskaya withdrew from her part as Alice due to a medical condition, returning later when no alternative could be found.

After a number of unhappy people commented on the website about then change, specifically asking why Ciofi had not been chosen to replace Damrau back in June, the ROH added: 'We are sorry that the cast change causes disappointment.

'Patrizia Ciofi wasn't originally available to replace Diana Damrau, as she was not available for the rehearsal period, but we are extremely grateful to her for having jumped in with such short notice immediately after ending her last engagement in Avignon.

'We do of course take full responsibility for believing wholeheartedly in this casting six months ago, and I am sorry that the change now has caused disappointment and irritation.

'We still are very excited about Jennifer Rowley's voice, and we look very much forward to presenting Jennifer Rowley as Musetta - a role she has received much deserved acclaim for - and are discussing another significant role with her, as stated above.

'As for ROH having many last minute cast changes, I do agree that we have been particularly unlucky in the last year with too many cast changes, most of them due to illness or other circumstances beyond our control.

'We are very sorry for this, and I do assure you it is something that we never announce with a light heart. We will do all we can to prevent this and hopefully will have fewer cast changes in the future.'

Comments on the Royal Opera House website reveal that fans have mixed feelings about the last-minute cast change...

'I am shocked and very disappointed. This is a very big mistake. It is 
sad that people of London and around the world will not hear Miss Rowley
 in this roll [sic] this year at your house!!' Mike

'I hope all this annoying cast changing will not influence the planned 
future DVD release that is announced on the website. This fantastic 
opera needs more attention and more respect during preparation!' Sgett

'This is very sad news to me...I have heard Jennifer Rowley sing and am 
very sorry the people of London will not have that opportunity.' Wyona Mitchell
