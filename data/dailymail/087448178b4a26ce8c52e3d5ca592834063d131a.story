A man whose dangerous driving caused the death of a pregnant woman as he tried to outrun pursuing police has been jailed for a total of 10 years.

Javad Malik, 26, killed newlywed Ahtia Tabasim, 28, when his Renault Laguna ploughed into the back of her car in the Saltley area of Birmingham in the middle of the afternoon in January.

Malik, of Yardley Fields Road, had undertaken other cars, driven towards oncoming traffic and raced at speeds of up to 105mph in the moments before the crash as he sought to evade police.

Horror: Pregnant Ahtia Tabasim, left, was killed when Javad Malik's car ploughed into the back of her vehicle when he was on the run from the police. He has been jailed for 10 years today.

He was carrying drugs in a tin on the back seat of his car worth Â£12,580.

In his victim impact statement, her husband, Badar Zaman, said: 'All the things I always wanted in life or have been interested in mean nothing to me now, without Ahtia.

'I'm just waiting for my time to come so that God can reunite us.'

Reading aloud the statement at Birmingham Crown Court, His Honour Judge William Davis QC concluded by telling Malik: 'That is what you did (to her family).'

He added that the sentence he imposed 'will not begin to bring back' Mrs Tabasim, who was a carer.

For causing death by dangerous driving, Malik was jailed for seven years, with a further three years to be served consecutively for two counts of possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.

There was no separate penalty for possession of cannabis, driving without insurance or a licence.
