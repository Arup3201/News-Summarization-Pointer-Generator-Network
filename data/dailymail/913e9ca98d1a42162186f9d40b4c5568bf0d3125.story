It's about bloomin’ time! After weeks of snow and freezing weather, spring is expected to arrive at the weekend bringing temperatures of up to 20C (68F). 

The South East and East Anglia will experience the warmest conditions on Sunday and Monday, and temperatures in Scotland and northern England will also venture into double-figures.

The Jetstream, which governs most weather in the northern hemisphere, has been positioned to the south of the UK for the last month, leading to the bitter weather.

But forecasters said that it will 
finally start to move north over the weekend, leading  to more 
spring-like conditions.

Despite the weekend forecast, parts of England  
and Scotland were still covered in snow  yesterday as temperatures 
remained unseasonably low – between 4C (39F) and 7C (45F) – following 
one of the coldest Marches on record.

And we won’t be able to ditch our 
winter coats just yet, as forecasters warned that bitter Scandinavian 
winds will keep temperatures freezing for the next three days.

But daytime temperatures across the 
country will begin to pick up today, with highs of 11C (52F) to 12C 
(54F) in the South and South West and 8C (46F) in the South East.

Forecast: Tomorrow is due to be cloudy across the country, while Thursday will see rain before some sun starts to appear on Friday

Change coming: The snow in Teesdale, County Durham, might still remain, but temperatures are expected to leap to 20C in parts of the country after Sunday

Met 
Office forecaster Emma Sharples warned that not all areas will 
experience higher temperatures on Sunday but added: ‘Without a doubt 
it’s going to start to feel very different.

‘There was a lot of sun in some parts last weekend but it was still very chilly.

‘But on Saturday, London could see 
temperatures of around 15C (59F) and on Sunday, when the winds aren’t so
strong, we could even hit 18C (64F).’

Miss Sharples said that a split could
develop next week with the South and East experiencing warm and bright 
conditions and northern parts seeing the ‘lion’s share of the rain’.

Billy Payne, a forecaster at 
Meteogroup, said: ‘Cold easterly winds have continued to cause snow in 
the North of England and Scotland, with a quite brisk wind coming from 
Scandinavia still affecting large parts of the country.

‘Tonight will be wintry again with accumulations of snow on the high ground.

‘But we are seeing change on the way 
through Thursday, with heavy rain pushing north and bringing 
temperatures up with milder air before things get warmer next week.

‘By Sunday and into Monday 
temperatures should be driving towards 20C in the South East and East 
Anglia, and double digits in Scotland and the North of England.’
