A mother who searched high and low for her son's beloved lost dog was devastated to find that a rescue agency had taken in the animal... only to refuse to give her back.

Instead of reuniting the pet and her owner, the agency said it was too late because they had already arranged an adoption to a 'better' home.

Rosa Torres searched her Panorama City neighborhood, posted on Craigslist and started a Facebook page when Raffiki, her Rhodesian ridgeback puppy, went missing on February 13, the LA Times reports.

After a week's search, a volunteer saw that Raffiki's image was up on a website for shelter Karma Rescue, listing her for adoption under the name Kami. Karma Rescue is 10 miles from Torres' home.

Daniel Torres, 4, cries whenever he looks at pictures of Raffiki -- who was adopted by a new family under the name 'Kami'

Rosa Torres, the dog's original owner, claimed her application to own her own dog back was rejected because she 'lives in a bad neighborhood'

Torres told the paper that she has fought to get Raffiki back -- but was told by the shelter she could not do anything after another family paid a $300 'adoption contribution' and took her home on February 21.

'I'll do whatever it takes,' she said. 'She's not just an animal, she's a part of our family. My 4-year-old son [Daniel] cries whenever he looks at her picture. We just want her back.'

Torres said she even applied on Karma Rescue's website to adopt her own dog back and called the shelter but did not receive a response.

Raffiki, seen playing with Daniel, 4, is 'part of our family,' mother Rosa Torres says. 'We just want her back'

Though Torres' application was reportedly rejected because Raffiki had not been microchipped or spayed, the dog was scheduled to do so three days before it went missing

When pressed by the paper, Karma Rescue said that Torres' application did not meet its qualifications for pet owners. As Torres' pet, the dog reportedly was not microchipped, spayed, or have ID tags.

A lawyer for Karma Rescue, Susan 
Willis, also told The Times that 'had [Rosa Torres] been a little more 
diligent, we would have spoken with her.'

The dog was scheduled to be spayed and microchipped on February 16, CBS Los Angeles reports. Torres believes she was not considered because she lives in a 'bad part of town.'

The decision to place the dog with a new family has even caused a rift inside Karma Rescue. Jessica Gary, a volunteer with the shelter, reportedly resigned over the 'elitism' she saw.

Torres' call to the shelter to get the dog back was placed over an hour before her new owners submitted an online application

Today, Karma Rescue published a statement on its Facebook page, defending its decision to place the dog with a new family. The letter confirms that Torres contacted the shelter before the dog's adoption and that it did not check its voicemail messages before the adoption.

'On February 21 at 6:03 p.m., Karma received, and approved, an adoption application for Kami, and requested the applicant family have an in-person meet-and-greet with her,' it reads. 'That family met Kami at NKLA and took her home that day.'

'At 6:54 p.m. that evening, Karma Rescue received an e-mail containing a second application for Kami from "Rosa Torres." However, this application was not reviewed until after the adoption was complete. Karma received a voicemail at 4:57 p.m. from "Rosa Torres" in which she claimed to be the dog's owner. Karma had not been aware of this voicemail until after the adoption had taken place.'

Meanwhile, Torres is continuing to look for signatures for her online petition, asking for the new owners to return the dog

The shelter, however, says that Torres should have contacted them 'sooner.'

'At 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 22, Karma contacted "Rosa Torres" to let her know Kami had already been adopted. She was also informed that had she contacted the organization sooner, Karma would have been in a better position to reunite her with the dog.'

The shelter also says that a woman named 'Lexi Quinn' has launched a social media assault against Karma Rescue.

'There have been inflammatory, misleading, outright false onling postings regarding Karma Rescue and and the events surrounding Kami's adoption,' it says.

The shelter also says the $300 may be waived when new owners have 'limited resources.'

Meanwhile, Torres has set up an online petition asking for the dog to be returned by its new owners.
