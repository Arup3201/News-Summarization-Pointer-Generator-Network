A new cap on pension charges will save average earners £100,000 over their lifetimes, ministers said last night.

The plans, aimed at stamping out high and unclear charges, are designed to boost the value of pension pots when people retire.

It is expected the new rules will transfer some £200million from the pensions industry to savers over the next ten years.

From April, people who are placed into a workplace pension as part of automatic enrolment will see their charges capped at 0.75 per cent. The average earner currently pays into a fund charging 1.5 per cent.

The plans were laid before Parliament in draft regulations yesterday.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the changes would ensure people would not see their money ‘disappear in opaque charging structures’.

He said: ‘There is an understandable buzz around what April will bring for those retiring now, with the unprecedented pension freedoms coming in. But these reforms show we are also determined to help the pensioners of tomorrow.’

Ministers said the new cap could save around £100,000 for an average earner who was currently paying into a fund charging 1.5 per cent, over the course of their working life.

Mr Webb told The Daily Telegraph: ‘With pension charges the devil is in the compounduing, because the numbers look very small and innocent but quickly mount up.

‘People saving into a pension today can have the confidence they will get good value for money throughout their working lives.’

The charge cap applies to the default pension options that people are placed into as a result of auto-enrolment into workplace pensions, to protect them against unwittingly having large chunks of their pots eaten up by high costs.

Savers can still choose to be in a pension with more expensive costs if they want to, because the saver will be making an active decision to shop around after weighing up the costs against the benefits.

The updated draft regulations will mainly come into force on April 6.

This is just as the Government’s retirement revolution is put into action, meaning that people aged over 55 will have much greater freedom over how they take their pension pot and they will no longer be herded towards buying a retirement annuity. 

More than five million people have been automatically enrolled into workplace pensions so far as part of the drive to encourage stronger savings habits as the population lives for longer.

By 2018, as many as nine million will be newly saving into a pension or saving more. Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority also set out new rules that will require firms to set up independent governance committees for workplace personal pension schemes.

These committees will act in savers’ interests by assessing the value of pension schemes and challenging providers to make changes where necessary. The rules will also come into force on April 6.

The move follows recommendations by the FCA’s predecessor body the Office of Fair Trading, which highlighted problems in 2013, when it said that the buyer side of the market was ‘one of the weakest’ it had analysed in recent years.

The OFT found that neither employers nor employees could be expected to drive effective competition between firms.

Around £30billion of savers’ money in older defined contribution workplace pension schemes was considered by the OFT to be at risk of delivering poor value, by modern standards, because of potentially high charges.
