A Nazi stalker obsessed with a woman who turned him down, sent his victim bullets in the post during a four-year reign of terror.

Daniel Coleman made a mocked-up video of the woman and her sister being beheaded with an axe and shot in the head, then sent it to their mother.

Coleman, from Derby, also threw a brick at the woman's window with a note tied to it saying he would 'slaughter her like a pig'.

Photographs were found of the 28-year-old dressed in a Nazi uniform and holding a gun when police raided his home.

Derby Crown Court heard that Coleman had 'a preoccupation with Germany, Austria and National Socialism'.

Coleman began the terrifying harassment after the girl rejected his advances and told him she did not want a relationship with him. In return he daubed the victim's name across the Odeon cinema, where she worked in Derby, and her house, calling her 'a dirty whore'.

Coleman was discharged by the army following a court conviction when he was a teenager.

Judge John Aucott handed Coleman a four-and-a-half year sentence after he pleaded guilty to harassment and gave him a lifelong restraining order banning him from contacting the girl and her family.

The judge said: 'You are not mad, you are bad. You did this for your own satisfaction and gratification.

'You subjected this poor girl and her family to persistent harassment for a number of years leaving her in a state of fear and constant nervousness.

'It says a lot for their character, and not yours, that they were able to function as a family at all. In 14 years this is the first time I have handed anyone who has come before me the maximum sentence I am allowed to.'

In 2006, Daniel Coleman was jailed for smashing headstones in Derby's Jewish Cemetery

Coleman was discharged by the Army following a court conviction when he was a teenager.David Outterside, prosecuting, said Coleman was jailed in 2006, along with another defendant, after smashing headstones at Derby's Jewish Cemetery.

On his release, in 2008, he met the woman, who was in her early 20s at the time.

Mr Outterside said: 'He told her he 
wanted a relationship with her but she said she didn't want to. The 
following day a brick was thrown at the window of the rented property 
where she lived with two friends.

'It
smashed one part of the double-glazed window and the brick was found on
the lawn of the front garden with a note tied around it. It said "I 
will slaughter you all like pigs."

'A
week later an envelope was found in the garden of the same property 
with a rifle bullet inside. On the envelope was written "I have a bullet
for each of you."'

Five days later Coleman set up a fake Facebook account under the name Theodore Robert Cowell, which Mr Outterside said was the real name of the American serial killer Ted Bundy.

Coleman was arrested and sent back to prison to serve the remaining half of his sentence for the criminal damage to the headstones.

On his release in March 2010 he began terrorising the victim again.

At Derby Crown Court, Judge John Aucott handed Coleman a four-and-a-half year sentence and gave him a lifelong restraining order banning him from contacting the woman and her family

In May 2010 he daubed the name of the
woman, calling her 'a dead bitch', in three feet high writing at the 
Odeon cinema and at the house where she lived.

She left the property, which belonged to her mother, and new tenants moved in.

A letter addressed by Coleman to his victim was delivered to the house. It read: 'Get out or I will firebomb your house.'

Then, in January last year, they were sent two DVDs containing photographs of the victim and her sister altered to make it appear as if they had suffered gun and knife wounds.

Mr Outterside said: 'He has a preoccupation with Germany, Austria and National Socialism.

'One photograph the police found showed him wearing an army uniform and holding a firearm.'

Julia King, for Coleman, said: 'It is an appalling catalogue of incidents but there was no actual violence.'

Speaking after the hearing DC Andy Hulland, who worked on the investigation, said: 'The family are absolutely overjoyed at the length of the sentence the judge has handed out.

'They have been through a dramatic ordeal and it is a testament to them that they have handled themselves with such dignity during this time. I don't think anyone who has come across Coleman sees him as anything other than a nasty piece of work.'
