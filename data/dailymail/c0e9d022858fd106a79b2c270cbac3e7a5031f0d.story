A diabetic Brooklyn man says was escorted out of a movie theater Sunday for eating strawberries.

Michael Kass, of Park Slope, was told by multiple employees he could not bring the berries into the theater but did so anyway.

Kass, a type 2 diabetic, was at the Pavillion Theater to see ‘Divergent’ when the incident occurred.

The guilty party: Michael Kass was escorted out of the theater by police for refusing to throw away strawberries

The berries were first spotted by a ticket collector who said he had to throw them out, Kass explained to NBC.

He pleaded his case to a theater manager and then asked for a refund but was told no.

‘I probably thought I was calling her bluff,’ he said. ‘I didn't in a million years think they would actually call the cops on me for bringing strawberries into a movie theater.’

Kass walked into the theater with the berries and the police arrived soon after.

The man told NBC that he hopes this will convince theaters to add healthier snacks than the usual tooth-rotting and gut-busting fare.

‘I'm fully hoping to get gouged on strawberries,’ he joked. ‘I hope they charge me up the wazoo for them.’

The theater did not return a message left for comment.
