Victory: 'Godfather of retail' Tony Shiret outside The East London Employment Tribunal building, where he won his unfair dismissal case against Credit Suisse

A City big-hitter nicknamed the 'Godfather of retail' could be handed a £1million payout because he was unfairly dismissed at 55, a tribunal has ruled.

Expert analyst Tony Shiret also successfully argued he was the victim of age discrimination after banking giant Credit Suisse made him redundant in favour of younger staff.

After 18 years there he lost his job in June 2011 but said the process was 'preselected without any consultation, weighted against me and inherently unfair'.

Mr Shiret said the points system set-up to decide who would stay was 'fixed' in favour of a colleague in his thirties.

'It is apparent that I was targeted for redundancy whilst my younger subordinate was given some form of assurance that he would progress in his career. It will be seen these scores were inherently unfair and were tainted by age discrimination,' he told a London tribunal.

He added that Credit Suisse 'merely went through the motions' of a redundancy process but had already decided he must go.

The bank 'vigorously denied' his claims but was found to have acted in a 'discriminatory and unfair way' when judging their former employee.

Employment Judge Brown criticised  Steven East, co-head of the pan-European equity department, and told of emails which referred to 'knifing' Mr Shiret.

'The tribunal finds that Mr East was not a credible witness when talking about these emails. He did not make eye contact. He gave brief answers and appeared to be uncomfortable,' she added.

Mr Shiret said he was thrilled Credit Suisse would be 'held to account', and could receive a seven-figure pay-off.

'I think that you have to give people a chance to demonstrate that they can still do a job and not assume that, once they reach a certain age, they cannot do a job for you,' he told The Times.

'The other side can argue that, in this case, it was a screw-up. But if you read the judge's ruling, it looks more systemic.'

A spokesman for the banking giant said: 'We are disappointed by the decision. Credit Suisse is an equal opportunities employer and does not condone discrimination on any basis.

'Having had an opportunity to review and consider the judgment, we have decided to appeal.'
