Upsetting: Solomon Davis, the father of death row inmate Brian Darrell Davis, wipes his tears away after appealing for the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to recommended clemency for his son

They are the tears of a desperate father, fighting to keep his condemned son alive.

Solomon Davis had just given a heartbreaking plea to a board which has the power to help prevent his death row inmate son from being executed in less than three weeks.

Brian Darrell Davis, 39, raped and murdered his girlfriend's mother in 2001.

But with his execution date set for June 25, Davis - with the support of his devoted parents - has asked for clemency from The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board.

As these pictures show, the emotion became to much for his father, who broke down in tears following his appeal to the five-member board.

The killer's mother, Yvonne, also begged for the life of her son.

Despite his reputation as a murderer, she showed the board pictures of her son as a baby, being cradled in the arms of his loving father.

The appeal appears to have worked. Yesterday, the board voted 4-1 to grant clemency to Davis.

It voted to recommend that the death sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole.

The recommendation will now go to the Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin for approval or rejection.

Davis was convicted of rape and first-degree murder in the November 2001 death of 52-year-old Jody Sanford.

The victim's daughter, Stacey Sanford, found her mother dead in the Ponca City apartment she shared with Davis.

Prosecutors say the victim had six stab 
wounds, a broken jaw and marks around her neck. DNA evidence showed she 
had also been raped.
