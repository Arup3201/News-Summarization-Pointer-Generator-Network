Prisoners have been handed £41million in benefits they are not entitled to, it has emerged.

For six years Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, sickness benefits and other state hand outs have been incorrectly paid to criminals behind bars. 

And the taxpayer is still owed £21million because the Department for Work and Pensions has only managed to claw back £19.7million.

Hapless: For six years Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, sickness benefits and other state handouts have been incorrectly paid to criminals behind bars

Labour MP Grahame Morris called for an investigation into the payment blunders.

He told the Daily Mirror: ‘This is just wrong. How can prisoners be overpaid £41million in benefits they are not entitled to? 

Iain Duncan Smith's Department for Work and Pensions has only clawed back £19.7million of the incorrect benefit payments

‘Benefits should be there for people who need them. 

‘This money could have been used so much better, for example, to make good the shortage of midwives in the NHS or pay for 2,500 more nurses.

'It shouldn’t be given in overpayments to men and women in jail.’

The benefits payments, covering six years since 2007, were disclosed following freedom of information requests.

In that first year prisoners were overpaid £8.8million in benefits.

A further £8.7million was wrongly handed out in 2008-09, £7.7million a year later, £14million from 2010-2012 and £2million last year.

A DWP spokesman said: ‘In law there is no entitlement to benefit when a person is in prison, therefore any benefit that is paid is recorded as an overpayment.’

'It is not possible to say what percentage of payments made to prisoners in any particular year is recovered, as some of the amount recovered could relate to overpayments recorded in earlier years.'

Some prisoners in certain circumstances are still entitled to Child Benefit and Housing Benefit.
