Adorable seven-month-old Grace has beaten more than 180,000 other little ones to become the new Gerber Baby.

Resting her head on her hands and sporting a cute smile, perhaps it's unsurprising this was the winning photo in baby food brand Gerber's 5th Annual Be Our Baby Photo Search. 

Grace and her parents, from East Petersburg, Pennsylvania, will now receive $50,000, one year of Gerber Baby Food, and the opportunity to appear in a Gerber ad as official 2015 'spokesbaby'. 

Gerber announced its newest star and winning entry in the 5th annual Gerber Be Our Baby Photo Search 2014 as Grace from East Petersburg, Pennsylvania (pictured)

Explaining how she captured the winning photograph, Grace's mother Gabrielle said: 'The photo that won was taken only five photos from when I started taking pictures of her that day.

'She must have taken her hands out of her mouth and posed them like that for a split second because I didn't even realize how cute she was posing until after I was completely done taking pictures and looking back at what I had just taken,' added Gabrielle in a press release, who has asked Gerber to keep family’s last name out of the press because of privacy concerns.

Cassie Savage, Marketing Specialist at Gerber added: 'While many of the entry photos this year met our criteria, Grace's captivating charm stole the judges' hearts. The Gerber Photo Search is celebrating its fifth year with this sweet new face!' 

The annual photo competition for find the new face of Gerber has been running for around five years, but for more than eight decades the baby food  featured the same iconic sketch on all its products.

Ann Turner Cook, now 87, became the first Gerber model in 1928, and her trademarked portrait has appeared on millions of jars, cartons and tubs of the baby food over the years.

Ann Turner Cook was just a few months old in 1928 when a charcoal sketch of her (pictured held by Mrs Cook) was selected in a contest to represent Gerber baby food

Mother-of-four, Mrs Cook, who lives in Tampa, Florida, got her modeling start in 1927, when family friend and artist Dorothy Hope Smith asked her mother if she could use Ann as a model.

And just like this year's search winner, the charcoal sketch of Ann was entered into, and won, a nationwide contest.

She became the first Gerber baby in 1928, and three years later the U.S. company decided to trademark her portrait. It has been used on every Gerber product ever since.

However it wasn't until 1978 that her identity was revealed, and guesses ranged from from movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor to former Senator Bob Dole.

Retired English teacher and mystery novelist, Mrs Cook said she felt very proud to have been known worldwide as the Gerber baby.

'I always had that expression with my mouth hanging open,' she told CBS News. 'Kind of a quizzical expression.

'I can't think of anything nicer than to be a symbol for babies. And that's what I think I became.'
