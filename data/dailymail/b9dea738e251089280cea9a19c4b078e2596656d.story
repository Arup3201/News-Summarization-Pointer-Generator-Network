Nazakat Ali was jailed for six years today. The immigration lawyer arranged sham marriages

A corrupt lawyer boasted of using 'b*******' European human rights laws to keep immigrants in the UK illegally.

Nazakat Ali, 38, said he would use the controversial legislation to stop clients being deported while they waited for a sham marriage.

The father-of-four helped broker deals in which desperate Pakistani and Indian men paid up to £10,000 to marry Eastern Europeans.

But he was secretly recorded gloating that he also used human rights laws to help his 'clients' evade the authorities.

Asked what he put on official paperwork claiming removal from the UK would breach their right to a family life, he replied: 'Just b*******.'

Yesterday, Ali was branded a disgrace to his profession and jailed for six years for his role in the sophisticated and lucrative scam.

Judge Mark Bishop said he was an arrogant man who traded on his reputation as someone who could 'get around' immigration controls.

He said: 'As an officer of the court you have a duty to maintain the rule of law and uphold the integrity of the legal system - by your actions you were doing the exact opposite.

'You were demonstrating a deep cynicism for the principles you plainly saw as expendable to get the result for your client that you wanted.' Ali posed as a wealthy and successful self-made lawyer, running his own firm from offices in East London's Upton Park.

He was a well-known as a generous member of the congregation at his local mosque and was urged to stand for election as a local councillor as a 'role model' for others.

But Inner London Crown Court heard he was secretly profiting from the misery of women smuggled into the UK and desperate immigrants on short-term visas.

The scam revolved around 'certificates of approval', in which non-European nationals had to ask border officials for permission to marry before applying for residency.

Ali charged up to £600 to complete the paperwork and 'set the ball rolling' for people who had exhausted every other route into the country.

The documentation was designed to convince officials at the UK Border Agency that the couple had met and fallen in love with the women.

Ali conned the Border Agency into believing that his Pakistani clients had met the women and had fallen in love with them

In fact, the women were flown in especially for the weddings and had only met their 'husbands' a few days earlier at Ali's office.

Ali's law firm processed a thousand certificates of approval over three years, but he was only convicted of acting unlawfully over three.

Detectives suspect the lawyer, who one victim said 'lived like a prince', is probably linked to dozens of other illicit marriages.

In 2010 Ali was caught red-handed by an undercover reporter posing as a concerned relative who wanted his nephew to stay after his student visa expired.

The lawyer kicked out the husband-to-be after his first 'bride' asked too many questions, but offered to arrange another deal if they found another candidate.

He was then filmed telling the relative in Punjabi that he must not discuss the sham marriage in front of his staff or the woman.

The judge said secretly recorded footage gave a 'bird's eye view' of how the confident and composed lawyer brokered the deal.

The case is being heard by Judge Mark Bishop at Inner London Crown Court in Southwark

He added: 'You advised that you would make a human rights application alongside the certificate of approval application, which would give appeal rights if it was refused.

'It would prevent the nephew being deported before the marriage took place. When asked what was put on this application you dismissively and cynically replied, "just b*******"

The court heard that some of the 'brides' were trafficked into the UK from the Czech Republic and Slovakia with the promise of legitimate work.

But once here they were forced into prostitution by a crime gang before being forced to marry Indian or Pakistani men.

One Czech woman said she was forced to have sex with Ali and up to four other men before handing over her passport for the marriage con.

In another case a man claimed he had met his bride at a party in 2008 but she had applied for an emergency passport to travel to the UK just two days earlier.

Forged utility bills also appeared showing the man had been living with the woman for some time to bolster their application.

Ali's barrister Matthew Ryder said Ali's crimes were the result of a 'misreading and misunderstanding of how a solicitor should act.' He said his wife, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, is now likely to return to her native Denmark with their four young children.

'He has lost everything, his business, his reputation and his good name. It has been a very traumatic process for him,' he said.

Ali's high street company, which he started with a loan from his father in 2004, was shut down last week (April 17) and all staff made redundant.

The lawyer, of Forest Gate, East London, was convicted of two counts of assisting unlawful immigration and a further count of assisting an offence after an eight-week trial.

The crimes took place between July 2009 and December 2010. A further hearing will take place to strip him of the profits he made.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: 'We are clamping down on the criminals who seek to abuse the marriage system for their own gain.

'This sort of criminality is often linked to serious organised crime and preys on some of society’s most vulnerable people'.
