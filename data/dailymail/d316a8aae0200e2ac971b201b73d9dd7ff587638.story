His nephew may be about the jet off to the West Indies, but Prince Edward nonetheless did his bit for the royal family when he made an appearance at a seaside attraction closer to home.

The Earl of Wessex today found himself part of a less conventional royal photocall when he was pictured with SpongeBob Squarepants and Dora the Explorer at Nickelodeon Land in Blackpool, Lancashire.

The 47-year-old met the children's TV favourites during his visit to the seaside attraction, where he unveiled a plaque to mark his visit to Nickelodeon Land.

Prince Edward is taking part in a two-day tour of Lancashire which started yesterday.

The £10.3million Nickelodeon Land was officially opened by former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff in 2011 on the resort's Pleasure Beach.

The attraction has 12 rollercoaster and other fairground rides featuring characters that appear on the children's TV channel.

During his tour of Blackpool to make 
the Queen's Diamond jubilee year, the Prince also visited the 'Comedy 
Carpet' featuring comedy catchphrases of top comics etched in granite 
and concrete.

In slightly 
sunnier climes meanwhile, Prince Harry will jet to Jamaica next month 
during his diamond jubilee tour of the Caribbean and Central America.

While Prince Edward today met SpongeBob Squarepants, Harry will chat to Usain Bolt when he meets the Jamaican sprinter in Kingston as part of his visit.

It is expected that Bolt, who defends his Olympic 100-metre title at London 2012 this summer, will give Harry a few pointers about starting a sprint but - luckily for the royal - not actually race him.

The second-in-line to the throne is said to be ‘bouncing’ in anticipation of his first solo overseas tour on behalf of the Queen to mark the monarch's 60-year reign.
