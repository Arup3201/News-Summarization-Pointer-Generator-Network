Britain has a ‘hideous’ attitude to success, the chairman of a literary prize warned yesterday as she announced that double Booker prize winner Hilary Mantel had been shortlisted for yet another award.

She warned that far from praise, Miss Mantel was at risk of ‘vitriolic’ criticism.

Actress Miranda Richardson, the chairman of judges for the Women’s Prize for Fiction, felt she had to defend the decision to honour Mantel.

She said the 60-year-old writer deserved to be on the shortlist of six female authors, regardless of her previous success. But she feared the author could become the victim of ‘tall poppy syndrome’, and be viliﬁed for having ‘too much success'.

Richardson, known for her role as Queenie in Blackadder, also said she was ‘very keen’ to see Mantel make the ﬁnal cut for the prize.

Richardson said yesterday it would be unfair to expect those who had been ‘lauded’ before to miss out on further recognition.

She said: ‘I was very keen to keep a balanced approach about Hilary Mantel because I’ve heard what we call the “tall poppy syndrome”, particularly in Britain.’

‘People have been quite vitriolic in 
some cases. I think it’s disgusting, quite frankly. “You’ve already had
too much you can’t have any more. Go away and die now”.’

Richardson, who having won two Golden 
Globes and a Bafta and been twice nominated for Academy Awards, has 
perhaps experienced the phenomenon she described.

She called such disdain for success a
‘hideous’ British trait.

Mantel has previously won the Man Booker Prize
and Costa Book Award for her best-selling Bring Up the Bodies, the 
sequel to her novel Wolf Hall, which also claimed the Booker.

If she wins the Women’s Prize for Fiction she would become the ﬁrst novelist to receive all three.

She is joined on the shortlist by two 
previous winners – Zadie Smith, who triumphed in 2006 with On Beauty; 
and Barbara Kingsolver,  whose novel The Lacuna won the prize in 2010.

Mantel, who sparked a furore when she
described the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’, has 
previously acknowledged criticism of her success.

She said: ‘I’m not sorry, I’m happy and I shall make it my business to try to write more books that will be worth more prizes.’

American author A M Homes, who said 
she was ‘thrilled’ to be nominated, said American literary awards did 
not suffer from the same anti-success sentiment.

She said: ‘I don’t think somebody 
should be punished because her work is so good. Hilary Mantel is clearly
a wonderful writer and should not be exempt from winning prizes.’

Author Kate Mosse, the co-founder of the prize, said the shortlist was ‘exceptional”.

The winner of the £30,000 prize will be announced on June 5.
