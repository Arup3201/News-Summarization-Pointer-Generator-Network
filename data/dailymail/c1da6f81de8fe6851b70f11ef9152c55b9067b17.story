General Sir Peter Hall warned British Army does not yet know full strengths and abilities of Islamic State 

Britain should not enter a conflict with Islamic State fighters as we do not know the full scope of their strengths, an army chief has warned. 

General Sir Peter Wall, Outgoing Chief of General Staff for the British Army, said the Government should not rush to intervene in the ongoing brutality being carried out by the 'grotesque' militants as it does not yet have a full understanding of the group's 'capabilities'. 

Likening the situation to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, he added the only thing worse than reacting too quickly would be to not react at all.  

'Isil has committed grotesque acts of terrorism, but I am not what kind of understanding we have of their strength and capabilities,' he told the Telegraph. 

'We have to be very careful that we do not get sucked into an international conflict without having a proper understanding of the situation on the ground... we were found wanting in these respects in Iraq and Afghanistan and it took some time to get things right.'

David Cameron has shied away from offering any definitive plans but has dismissed notions of sending British troops to fight in the war-torn Syria and Iraq. 

Sir Peter's comments come as a branch of the extremist militants publicised the beheading of a Lebanese soldier this weekend, posting photographs on Twitter which are believed to depict the murder. 

Abbas Medlej, 20, was among at least 19 Lebanese soldiers kidnapped by Sunni militants when they stormed a border town in Syria last month. 

The soldier, a Shiite Muslim, is thought to have been killed after trying to escape captivity. 

American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were both slaughtered by the extremist group, with footage of their murders circulated around the world. 

They were both kidnapped earlier in Syria while reporting the ongoing conflict.  

At least 29 people were killed in the Syrian city of Raqqa on Saturday as a result of government airstrikes. 

Comments come after the believed beheading of a Lebanese soldier at the hands of IS militants. Abbas Medlej was reportedly murdered by the group after trying to escape captivity. If verified, photographs of the beheading would be the third circulated on social media by the organisation 

An IS fighter carries the group's sinister flag - its motto translating from Arabic as 'There is only one god' 

President Assad's army has sought to regain control of the region since it was taken by IS militants earlier this year. 

At least 20 civilians died alongside nine extremists when eight blasts tore through the city which has a population of around 500,000. 

In a separate incident, Iraq's airforce killed at least 22 following airstrikes on a hospital. 

The attack near Kirkuk city is one of a series of raids by war aircraft in the area according to witnesses.
