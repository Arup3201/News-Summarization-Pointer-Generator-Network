Three-day old Melako the zebra makes a wobbly attempt to show off for visitors at an Australian zoo in Melbourne, Victoria.

Although Melako seems to suffer an unstable start, the adorable foal was soon galloping across his enclosure under the watchful eye of his mother Shani.

Melako is the latest addition to the zebra herd at Werribee Open Range Zoo, which is the largest in Australasia.

The male foal will soon join the 
18-strong herd and but is being kept separate by his protective mother 
until he has steadied his step.

‘Mum is very protective,’ zoo spokeswoman Kym Carter told the Herald Sun.

‘She doesn't let him out of her sight, she's a good mum.’

Melako was named after a Kenyan conservation park which the zoo supports through a programme called Beads for Wildlife.

Beadwork made by local women living in
Melako are sold through Werribee Zoo to support them and their children
through their craft.

Beads for Wildlife also funds wildlife monitoring, security and anti-poaching patrols in the park, located in northern Kenya.
