The watching world were treated to a celebration of colour, dance and music as Brazil officially unleashed the 2014 World Cup.

The location? Arena de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The reason? Kick-starting the world's greatest tournament, and in some style too.

Much was debated as to whether Brazil would be up to hosting the World Cup but, judging by this opening ceremony, they seem to be off to a fairly good start.

The World Cup has had its fair share of memorable opening ceremony moments - none more so than Diana Ross fluffing her lines by missing a penalty with an open goal in 1994.

But
 there were few of that in these Samba celebrations, as Brazil 
showed it was up to the task ahead of the clash against Croatia.

It all centred around a giant luminous Brazuca ball - a fitting focal point given the journey it was about to embark upon.

The ball, then, split into segments and opened up towards the climax to reveal Claudia Leitte. Then, Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull, wearing a Brazil top, rose to the platform as well.

There was an awkward moment when the elevating platform seemed to get stuck and Pitbull had to help J-LO up before the pair performed the official World Cup song 'We Are One (Ola Ola)'.

The
 opening ceremony gave youngsters from dance groups, schools and 
training academies in Sao Paulo the chance to be part of the 
celebrations, too.
