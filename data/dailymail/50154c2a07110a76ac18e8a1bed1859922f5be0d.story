St. Paul Saints fans were in no rush to get into Thursday night's game once they realized the ticket checker was Bill Murray.

The Academy Award nominee, comedy legend, and master of the random public appearance greeted fans at the main gate, took pictures, and even threw the first pitch out into the stand's for a lucky fan.

Upproxx reports that Murray is co-owner of the minor league team and wanted to help say goodbye to Midway Stadium, which closed its doors after the game.

Murray even threw the first pitch out the fans

He was joined at the stadium by fellow Saturday Night Live alum, Minnesota Sen. Al Franken.

Coincidentally, Murray's 1984 classic Ghostbusters is getting a 30th anniversary re-release this weekend, but the star has a history of popping up in the most unlikely places whether he has a movie coming out or not.

Back in 2010, Vulture reported Murray started bartending in Texas after one night of tequila shots during the SXSW festival.

Murray has became famous for random public appearances such as giving a speech at a bachelor party and bartending in Texas

And this year alone, Gawker reported that he posed in a random couple's engagement photos while visiting South Carolina.

Later this summer, as Gawker also reported, he imparted years of hard-earned wisdom on matrimony to a stunned bachelor party.
