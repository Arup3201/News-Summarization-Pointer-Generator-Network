The public sector has labelled Treasurer Joe Hockey's first federal budget a 'wrecking ball' after he announced 16,500 public servants will lose their jobs over the next four years.

Mr Hockey says the job losses, which are 4500 more than the coalition promised would be cut at the 2013 federal election, will make the bureaucracy more efficient and accountable.

The job cuts are only 2000 more than the 14,500 bequeathed by the previous Labor government.

Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey has announced thousands of public sector job cuts in his first budget in Canberra on Tuesday

The Australian Tax Office will carry the largest reduction, with 4700 jobs to go in the next four years.

National broadcasters ABC and SBS will also take a hit, losing $43.5 million in funding over four years.

The coalition at the election promised not to cut funding to two broadcasters.

But the 2014/15 budget includes a one per cent cut in their base funding, described as a 'down payment' on an efficiency study completed earlier this year.

Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood said the 16,500 figure doesn't include the 'many further job losses' that will flow from the government's program of privatisation and outsourcing.

The ABC will lose $35.5 million in funding, a move the Community and Public Sector Union says 'will do enormous damage to our public broadcaster'

'Not one single job loss that will come from those [privatisation or outsourcing] efforts is counted in this budget,' Ms Flood said.

'We could see tens of thousands of jobs go over these next few years.

''Tony Abbott's Budget is a wrecking ball that smashes jobs and services... It's a myth you can cut this many jobs and not affect services.'

Ms Flood was critical of the cuts to the ABC, SBS, ATO and the announcement that the CSIRO would lose $111.4 million over the next four years.

'Ripping $35.5 million out of the ABC, closing the Australia Network and cutting $8 million from SBS will do enormous damage to our public broadcasters,' she said.

The Australian Tax Office will carry the largest staff reduction, with 4700 jobs to go in the next four years

'Cutting 2300 tax workers is not going to help us collect the revenue Australia needs for essential services.

'Cutting 500 CSIRO staff will not help us come up with world-class innovations we need for globally competitive industries.

'And cutting civilian staff in Defence simply means taking soldiers out of the frontline and putting them behind desks.'

Ms Flood also said the assertion the previous Labor government had bequeathed 14,500 job cuts was 'a myth'.

'Worst year of Labor cuts was 2,500 jobs. Now we're facing triple that number,' she said.

Six-hundred public service jobs in the defence department are set to go in the next financial year.

In total, more than 2000 positions will be lost by 2017/18 through natural attrition and changes to recruitment practices.

The CPSU has labelled Mr Hockey's first federal budget a 'wrecking ball'

But defence will get an extra $800 million to make $29.2 billion in 2014/15 and will benefit from almost $33 billion in 2017/18, the budget papers show.

The public sector union had feared losses of more than 25,000, saying 6000 announced before the budget had already stretched government services to breaking point.

The Budget outlined the government's plan to further shrink the number of assets owned by the federal, state and territory governments to achieve it.

Private health fund Medibank has already been slated for a hoped-for $4 billion sale.

The SBS will lose $8 million in funding

Among other assets the federal government said it was investigating selling were the Royal Australian Mint; the registry services of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, plus Defence Housing Australia and Australian Hearing.

'The government is transforming its role to be smaller and as efficient and well-targeted as possible, with some changes informed by the National Commission of Audit's recommendations,' it said in the budget papers. States and territories would be encouraged to sell assets and develop infrastructure too.

They would receive 15 per cent of the price of an asset sold if the sale proceeds go to new infrastructure investment.
