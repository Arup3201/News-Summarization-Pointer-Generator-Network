One pizza restaurant has introduced the ultimate divisive dining policy - banning unruly children from the premises.

Grant Central Pizza tacked a notice on to the bottom of the menu, asking that parents remove their children if they cause a scene and interrupt the meals of other patrons.

The decision was made at the restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia after the owner saw negative reviews that past diners posted online about their meals being ruined by misbehaving children. 

Polite reminder: Grant Central Pizza in Atlanta, Georgia has added a message to its menu asking parents to take unruly children outside to deal with them

Donnie Parmer insists that they are still a family establishment and welcome parents who bring their children along for dinner.

Mr Parmer told Fox Atlanta: 'There have been some comments about crying children.

'But beyond that, we had a child hit a customer in the head with a toy... that was not the customer's child... or toy.'

The written request on the menu states: 'Dear all present and future patrons: GCP is proud of its reputation as a
family restaurant, a title that we will work to keep.

'Unfortunately a 
number of our diners have posted unpleasant experiences because of 
crying and unsupervised children.

Making a stand: Donnie Parmer, co-owner of the pizza restaurant, made the decision after a customer was hit on the head by a flying toy

Take it outside: Grant Central Pizzeria has been applauded by many customers for their decision

'To ensure that all diners have an 
enjoyable lunch or dinner with us we respectfully ask that parents tend 
to their crying tots outside.'

The response has been mostly positive from customers.

On Yelp, which lists more than 50 reviews for the pizza joint, one customer wrote: 'I read your rule about banning crying children and may I say 'IT'S ABOUT TIME'! 

'I am so tired of spending my hard earned money to listen to kids scream.'
