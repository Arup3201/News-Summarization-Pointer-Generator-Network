Letters may take up to three days to arrive in the mailbox unless customers pay more for a priority service as part of an Australia Post plan to cut costs.

The price of a stamp will reflect the speed of delivery, with customers being able to choose from three options - regular, priority and express.

Priority delivery, which will come at a higher fee, will be delivered five times a week and regular mail delivery will take place one to two days after the priority service.

The proposed cuts to delivery services were announced as Australia Post's managing director Ahmed Fahour revealed the company's mail section lost $328.4 million in the last year financial year.

Mr Fahour said the new priority service would reflect the cost of delivery, with the current 70 cent cost of a stamp not covering the service, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would need to approve the price of a priority stamp before it could be implemented and Communication Minister Malcolm Turnbull would have the right to appeal the decision, according to his spokesman.

Australia Post's dwindling mail service is delivering a third fewer letters than five years ago and Mr Fahour said the letter division could post a $6.6 billion loss in the next 10 years unless cuts were made.

'Unfortunately without significant and urgent reform of our community service obligations, the loss in the regulated mail business will overwhelm the entire company and result in the enterprise making a loss in the near future,' Mr Fahour said in a statement.

'Profit growth in parcels has covered the growing losses in letters again in this full year but possibly for the last time. These results are a stark illustration of the urgent need for changes to the regulations governing our letters service.

Australia Post said profit growth in parcels covered the growing losses in letters again last financial year

'Without these, a government-commissioned external report estimates that we will incur $12.1 billion cumulative losses in letters, and $6.6 billion for the enterprise over the next 10 years.'

Australia Post announced on Thursday a full-year profit of $116.2 million, down 34.5 percent from the previous year.
