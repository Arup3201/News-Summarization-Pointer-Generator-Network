Bottles of liquid egg whites, often used by bodybuilders and bakers, have been recalled after they were linked to salmonella.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the pasteurised product had been associated with seven cases of the food poisoning.

The infection causes diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever.

Bottles of Myprotein liquid egg white have been recalled after they were linked to cases of salmonella

The Food Standards Agency is trying to trace the source 
of the eggs used in the product.

The products were sold through the 
Myprotein and Nutri Centre stores and website.

The L232203 batch of Myprotein Free Range Liquid Egg Whites has been recalled

The L232203 batch of Myprotein Free
Range Liquid Egg Whites, with an expiry date of February 2013, was 
recalled on October 10 by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

No other Myprotein products are known to be affected.

Dr Bob Adak, the head of gastrointestinal diseases at the HPA said: 'This egg product has been subject to a recall and so we hope that now it is no longer in circulation that this will stop people becoming unwell.

'If anyone has any of this batch of product at home then they should dispose of it.'

He added: 'Although there has been no
increase in the number of cases of this type of salmonella over recent 
weeks we are still investigating whether newly identified cases might be
related to this egg product.'

This
is the second case of Salmonella linked to liquid egg whites, in 2007 a
similar outbreak affected 70 people in England, Wales and the Chanel 
Islands.

Customer 
notices are being displayed on both stockists' websites. Anyone who has bought the affected product is advised to to phone Myprotein customer 
services on 0845 094 9889.
