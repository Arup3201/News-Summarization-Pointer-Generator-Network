A new language has been discovered in a small outback Australian town.Â 

The language, now known as Light Warlpir, is used in Lajamanu, a tiny desert community located half-way between Darwin and Alice Springs, on the edge of the Tanami Desert.

The isolated village has a population of about 700 and is populated mostly by the descendants of Aborigines forcibly resettled by the Australian government.

All residents speak traditional 'strong' Warlpiri and some speak Kriol, an English-based creole developed in the late 19th century, reported Australia's Daily Telegraph.

Only about 350 young locals speak the Light Warlpir - and none of them are over 35.

Carmel O'Shannessy, a professor in the department of linguistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor documented the discovery of Light Warlpiri in a study published online in the journal Language reported LiveScience.

O'Shannessy first discovered the 
language when she began working in a school in the Northern Territory 
where traditional Warlpiri was being taught to children.

She noticed that some of the students appeared to switch between several languages in conversation.

'After a while, I realised this switching took place in every sentence, and I decided to investigate it," O'Shannessy said.

'Once
I recorded children speaking, I looked at the patterns and I could see 
that there were very striking systematic patterns. It was then that I 
realised this was a system of its own,' she told the website.

'The striking thing about Light Warlpiri
is that most of the verbs come from English or Kriol, but most of the 
other grammatical elements in the sentence come from Warlpiri,' 
O'Shannessy told the website.

In the Warlpiri language words can be placed in any order, and grammatical interpretations are based on suffixes that are attached to the nouns.

Another interesting facet is a word form that refers to both the present and past time, but not the future.

According to O'Shannessy it is likely Light Warlpiri emerged in the 1970s and 1980s.

She believes it was when children went from switching between English, Kriol and Warlpiri to speaking the mixed Light Warlpiri language on a primary basis.

The news, which has excited linguists across the world is not the first time the tiny town has hit the headlines.

In 2010, residents were left speechless after fish began falling from the sky.

Hundreds
of spangled perch bombarded residents of Lajamanu, shocking 
local Christine Balmer, who was walking home when the strange 'weather' 
started.

She said: 'These fish fell in their hundreds and hundreds
all over the place. The locals were running around everywhere picking 
them up.

Meterologists say the incident was probably caused by a tornado. It is common for tornados to suck up water and fish from rivers and drop them hundreds of miles away.
