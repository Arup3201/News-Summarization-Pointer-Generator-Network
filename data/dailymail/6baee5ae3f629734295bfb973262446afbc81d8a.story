These spectacular photos show peregrine falcons hunting pigeons in the skies over British cities.

The birds, some of the world's fastest creatures, were captured snatching the vermin above Bristol and London.

They can be seen soaring through the air with speeds of up to 240mph, before swiping the pigeons in their sharp talons.

Speedy: Peregrine falcons are some of the world's fastest creatures - and are also widely distributed globally

Peregrine falcons are the most widely distributed birds in the world - inhabiting all continents, except Antarctica.

However, in Britain, they are usually spotted in the skies above  mountain ranges, wild cliffs and other remote spaces.

Photographer Sam Hobson, 34, said it was 'amazing' to capture the birds hunting above the bustling cities.

'There is something amazing about seeing one of the world's fastest animals perched on a building you see every day,' he said. 'There are
 plenty of tall buildings in cities for the birds to perch on.'

Incredible: Photographer Sam Hobson, who has been tracking and photographing urban falcons for the past two years, said it was 'amazing' to capture the birds in Britain. Above, a peregrine falcon flies over Bristol

'Perfect habitat': 'We have unwittingly created the perfect habitat for the falcons in Britain,' said the 34-year-old

Mr Hobson, who has been tracking and photographing urban falcons in Bristol and London for the past two years, said the birds had been attracted to the cities because of their large number of pigeons and other migratory birds.

'I have seen falcons doing things they don't do in the countryside,' he said. 'For example, I witnessed them hunting at night.

'The
 falcons were using the city lights to spot other birds and then 
swooping on them.

Perching: Mr Hobson said March was a good month for picturing the birds. Above, a falcon on a perch

'We are used to seeing nocturnal hunting behavior in 
owls, but not peregrines.

'They were hunting different birds as well, not just pigeons. They preyed on a lot of migratory birds.'

He added that March was a good month for photographing the birds - saying: 'We are coming up to the time when falcons lay their first eggs of the year.

'Males are particularly territorial during this time, and attack other birds like seagulls which come anywhere near their nests.

'A couple of years ago two falcons in Bristol only managed to lay one egg, and a seagull knocked it into the floating harbour. Some workmen managed to fish it out with an umbrella, and it was saved.'

Mr Hobson said he had captured the falcons from vantage points on high buildings - while carefully observing their nesting habits to determine where they will appear.

'I stood on top of a car park all day, waiting for something to happen,' he said.

'From the pictures you would think these are really active birds, but often I sit there watching them perched on a ledge, digesting their food all day.'

Ben Hoare, features editor at BBC Wildlife Magazine, said peregrines have undergone a 'spectacular renaissance' in Britain - and have been attracted to cities because of their 'suitable prey'.

'There is plenty of suitable prey here, especially pigeons, and lots of nest sites too - a high ledge or flat roof is a perfect substitute for a cliff,' he said.

'The falcons have even learned to hunt after dark using the glow from streetlights, targeting the migratory birds that fly over our cities at night.

Suitable location: 'There is plenty of suitable prey here, especially pigeons, and lots of nest sites too,' he said

'When I started birdwatching in the 1980s, peregrine falcons were at a low ebb after decades of decline. But, today these fabulous birds of prey nest in full view in many British cities, often on cathedral towers or other tall landmarks.

'I see a pair of peregrines most days in central Bristol on my walk to work, and delighted local office workers love to follow the birds' progress as they raise a family.

'The birds seem remarkably tolerant of all the noise going on around them - once I saw the male peregrine perched on the end of a tower crane on a building site, completely oblivious as it swung through 90 degrees.'
