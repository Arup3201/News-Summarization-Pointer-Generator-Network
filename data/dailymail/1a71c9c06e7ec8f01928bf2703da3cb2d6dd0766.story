Australian brothers Liam and Chris Hemsworth have appeared on-screen together for a mock sequel to the viral YouTube clip Charlie Bit My Finger.

The skit, filmed exclusively for US talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, features the Hemsworth siblings in an action-packed spoof sequel to the original video - set 30 years later.

Hollywood A-listers Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks also feature in the two-minute dark clip, directed by Batman's Christopher Nolan.

Hollywood actor Tom Hanks stars as the Hemsworth's father, and warns Liam's character that his brother is 'coming for him'

The original Charlie Bit My Finger video, which shows a young boy squealing hilariously as his baby brother painfully chomps on his index finger, has more than 670 million views on YouTube.

The viral clip generated hundreds of copycat videos, with many trying to recreate the scene with their own siblings and friends.

Nolan's 'Bitman Begins' clip, which aired in the US two days ago, has already got almost 700,000 views.

The spoof video starts with Chris Hemsworth sitting in an armchair, still devastated over the imagined incident from 30 years ago.

'He was my brother...and we were inseparable,' he said, before comparing the two to Biblical characters Cain and Abel.

'His teeth were like razors.'

A British accented Meryl Streep, playing Hemsworth's mother, pleads for Chris to 'let it go'.

But Chris retorts: 'I will find him...and I will destroy him.'

A hooded Tom Hanks holding a flaming torch is then shown warning Liam that Chris is 'coming for him' while dramatic music plays.

The music escalates and the video then cuts to the brothers chasing each other on top of a city rooftop.

When they come to a stop, Liam pleads that 'he was only a child' when the incident occurred - but Chris angrily replies that his younger brother was 'an animal', before holding up his mutilated left hand.

After lunging at each other the pair then end up on the ground below in a pool of blood - with Chris delivering a hilarious line that people who have watched the original clip will understand before the credits roll.
