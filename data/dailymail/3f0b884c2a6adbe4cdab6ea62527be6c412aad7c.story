Britain and Germany will work together on hi-tech new household goods that can talk to each other over the internet, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister met German Chancellor at a trade fair in Hanover to launch what he called a 'new industrial revolution'.

He pledged £45million for new research to help scientists develop a new ideal known as the 'internet of things'.

This would put low-cost chips into household goods to allow, for example, electricity meters to hunt out the best deals, or water pipes to keep an eye on pressure.

The two leaders had dinner at which they discussed the Ukraine crisis and Mr Cameron's hopes for powers to be repatriated from Brussels to London.

The Prime Minister's call for a digital revolution on Sunday echo Harold Wilson's speech 51 years ago in which he called for Britain to be at the forefront of the 'white heat' of technology.

He and Mrs Merkel opened one of the biggest IT events in the annual business calendar, the CeBIT 2014 trade fair.

The UK is the event's official partner country, and Mr Cameron used the event to promote Britain to more than 2,500 industry representatives and set out how the UK and Germany should partner to lead the next digital revolution.

Mr Cameron said that strengthening the innovation sector will help to create a new wave of jobs and provide a more financially secure future for Britain,  for hardworking people and their families.

'This is a world on fast forward,' he said. 'A world of permanent technological revolution. And in this world, countries like the UK and Germany will only succeed if we have a relentless drive for new ideas and innovations.

'The UK tech scene today is dynamic. Relentlessly ambitious. Leading the way. It is our ambition to make the UK the most digital nation in the G8 and it is my mission to show the world that we’re getting there'

The two countries will work together on 5G broadband, enabling faster internet that would be quick enough to download a full length feature film in less than a second.

And they will also collaborate on the 'internet of things' – getting everyday objects talking to one another to simplify daily life.

This will be backed up by £45million of research funding.

Don't forget to tip: The trade fair featured thousands of innovations... including pole-dancing robots

The Prime Minister said: 'These are developments that could allow literally billions of everyday objects to talk to each other over the internet – using low-cost, low-power chips. And this has enormous potential to change our lives.

'Electricity meters that talk to the grid to get you the best deals. Health monitors that keep an eye on your heart rate. Water pipes that warn of a fall in pressure.

'I see the Internet of Things as a huge transformative development - a way of boosting productivity, of keeping us healthier, making transport more efficient, reducing energy needs, tackling climate change.

'We are on the brink of a new industrial revolution and I want us – the UK and Germany – to lead it. Take British ingenuity in software, services and design, add German excellence in engineering and industrial manufacturing and together we can lead in this new revolution.'
