Coventry councillors were  briefed on Monday night about the details of Wasps’ proposed takeover of the Ricoh Arena, before voting on the issue on Tuesday.

If approved, the club’s £30million investment would secure a 90 per cent stake in the venue’s operating company, ACL.

The Coventry Telegraph reported that council officers are likely to recommend a vote in favour of the takeover at 2pm on Tuesday.

If the attempt is successful, Wasps plan to move to a purpose-built training ground in Coventry and establish strong community links. 

Concerns have been expressed about the impact on Coventry RFC and Coventry City FC, who play at the Ricoh Arena. 

And many supporters of Wasps, who have been based in High Wycombe for years, are angry about the prospect of a move from London.
