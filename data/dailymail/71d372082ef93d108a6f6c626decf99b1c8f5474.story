Tim Sherwood has taken a step closer to being appointed Queens Park Rangers manager after Real Madrid coach Paul Clement ruled himself out of the running.

However, an agreement over personal terms for Sherwood is still to be reached - though the ex-Tottenham manager is still understood to be on course to replace Harry Redknapp, who left Loftus Road earlier this week.

Chairman Tony Fernandes, who still has to pay Redknapp the remaining six months of his contract, would prefer to offer his next boss a heavily-incentivised deal, which could yet be a stumbling block towards Sherwood’s appointment.

Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job

Fernandes has revealed he wants to to interview three candidates for the role; Sherwood, Clement and Steve McClaren.

However, Derby manager McClaren has no interest in returning to QPR, where he spent a spell as a coach last season, instead committing his efforts to the Rams’ promotion push.

And Clement has paved the way for Sherwood to take control after revealing he does not want the job either.

‘I’m very flattered to be linked with Queens Park Rangers, a club I supported as a young boy and for whom my Dad played,’ said Carlo Ancelott’s right-hand man.

‘It would be a real honour to manage that club at some point in the future. But, at this time, I’ve got no intention of leaving Real Madrid in mid-season.’

And unless there is a major twist, Sherwood, whose chances of landing the role improved significantly after close pal Les Ferdinand’s appointment as director of football, now looks en route for his first managerial job since being sacked by Tottenham in the summer.

It is understood no decision will be made until after tomorrow’s clash against Southampton.

Meanwhile, it is understood Kevin Bond is keen to staying on at QPR under the new regime.

The coach, one of Redknapp’s closest confidants, has remained at Loftus Road despite the 67-year-old’s departure.

And after a meeting with Ferdinand on Tuesday night, it is understood Bond, who is popular with the players, is open to staying at the club in some capacity once the new manager is installed.
