It's the classic scenario in a high school reunion movie - a character lies about their life to appear more impressive to old friends.

But it seems that stretching of the truth is not confined to fiction.

We are so desperate to impress that one in five of us lie to old friends - about things such as jobs and cars - in a bid to appear more successful, a study has revealed.

The research found 21 per cent of Brits admit fibbing when they get together with friends from school or university.

One in five of us lie about what job we are doing or what car we have in order to sounds more successful to old school friends

Men are most desperate to appear successful, with 55 per cent who tell tall tales exaggerating how much they earn.

The research, to mark the first National Reunion Week on September 10, found 8 per cent of the men also pretend to drive a much flasher car.

Meanwhile, of the women who stretch the truth, 45 per cent claim to have a far more glamorous job than the one they actually do.

Many (12 per cent) also lie to make it seem that they live in a much nicer area.

Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos 
said: 'We live in a time when everyone is desperate for everyone else to
 see them in the best possible light.

'People’s use of Facebook shows we are increasingly aware of how we can use certain information to manipulate what others think of us.

'And people don’t necessarily see why they should stick to the truth.

'So we tell people the postcode we have - or would like to have - or the car we have - or wish we had - to impress others.

'School reunions or gatherings of old college friends can be full of boastful untruths.

'All of those old feelings about whether you’re cool and "do I fit in?" seem to resurface.

High achievers? 42 per cent of us admit we would be loathe to go to a reunion, like American Pie crew (pictured), as we fear people showing off about what they've done with their lives

'Childhood insecurities rear their heads again when all these people get together and people increasingly resort to lies to impress each other.'

At such gatherings, boasting about the stamps in their passport is also a favourite, with 26 per cent of the braggards claiming to be much better travelled than in reality.

One in six Brits - 17 per cent - confess they would lie about their relationship status, perhaps in the hope of hooking up with an old flame.

And one in 17 men (6 per cent) admit they have been to a school reunion just to boast about their achievements.

Perhaps tellingly, 42 per cent of us admit we would be loathe to go to a reunion as we fear it would be full of people showing off about what they’d achieved.
