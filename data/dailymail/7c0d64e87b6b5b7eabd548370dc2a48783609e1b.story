A naked hairdresser stopped traffic on a residential street at the weekend by performing a sex act in front of a couple's car then climbing on top of it and throwing a tantrum when the police arrived.

Police were called to the intersection of East Par Street and Formosa Avenue in Orlando, Florida, home to two churches, at 11.15pm on Sunday night.

Amie Carter, 31, was seen by drivers walking down Formosa Avenue with no clothes on.

Amie Carter, 31, was charged with criminal mischief and exposure of sexual organs after masturbating naked in an Orlando street before climbing on top of a car and throwing a tantrum when police arrived

Carter kicked her legs into the air and threw a tantrum when cops showed up and tried to take her away

She then approached a white 2008 Lexus occupied by Eric and Sarah Carlson and was seen to 'fondle herself in front of the car' according to the arrest report.

Carter then climbed onto the hood of the car and stomped on it causing multiple dents to the hood and roof.

She then threw a cellphone at the vehicle behind, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The report stated that when police officers arrived they observed that Carter 'appeared to be under the influence [of] a heavy unknown substance'.

'She appeared in an altered mental state, displaying extremely irrational and volatile behavior.'

Carter appeared to be under the influence of 'heavy drugs,' according to cops

When Carter was asked to get out of the street, she refused.

Officers then tried to remove her from the roadway, but she resisted by 'by pulling and kicking her legs in the air'.

Once the officers had wrestled Carter to the side of the road, they placed her in handcuffs and covered her in a blanket.

Orlando Fire Department responded to the scene for medical assistance and Carter was transported to Florida Hospital South for observation. 

She was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and exposure of sexual organs and detained at Orange County Jail where she remains on a $1,100 bond.

She caused approximately $1,500 in damage to the Lexus and the Carlsons intend to press charges.
