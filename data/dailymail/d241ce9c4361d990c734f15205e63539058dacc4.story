Barack Obama has been accused of being disrespectful after being caught chewing gum during the Republic Day parade in India.

A photo of the President removing the gum from his mouth before popping it back in, has been shared across Twitter. At the time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be trying to explain something to the president.

'In an ungainly sight, cameras caught US President Brack Obama chewing gum during the Republic Day parade on Monday. In the picture captured by cameras and posted on Twitter by some users, Obama was spotted removing his chewing gum while PM Modi was seen trying to explain something to the US president,' the Times of India wrote.

U.S. President Barack Obama has been accused of being disrespectful, after being caught chewing gum during the Republic Day parade in India

Twitter user Shobhaa De was critical of the president saying 'seriously - gum during a formal parade'.

White House Correspondent Peter Baker speculated that Obama was most probably chewing Nicorette

Twitter user Shobhaa De wrote: 'Barack bhai working his jaws overtime and chewing gum! At least it's isn't gutka. But seriously - gum during a formal parade?' 

American media speculated that Mr Obama was most probably chewing Nicorette.

Peter Baker, a White House correspondent, tweeted, 'Obama appears to be enjoying parade, shown on Indian television bobbing his head with the music. Seems to be chewing gum, probably Nicorette.'

David B Cohen tweeted: 'That's his 21-gum salute RT @Vamsee9002: Just now saw Prez Obama chewing something.'

In November The Washington Post reported that Mr Obama was using the Nicorette to try and beat his cigarette cravings. 

Its report said: 'For Obama, gum isn't about vanity' and said his aides had described the president's quest to kick cigarettes as a 'lifelong struggle'. 

This isn't the first time Obama has been caught chewing gum.

He was lambasted on social media for doing so at the APEC summit in Beijing and at a Second World War ceremony in France.

Mr Obama was honored as the chief guest at India's annual parade and took in grand displays of Indian military hardware, marching bands, elaborately dressed camels and acrobatic feats. Along with first lady Michelle Obama, the president was greeted with rapturous applause as he joined the parade in New Delhi as part of a three-day visit to India. 

The visit is aimed at strengthening a relationship between the world's largest democracies that has at times been fraught with tension and suspicion. 

Mr Obama's attendance at the Republic Day celebrations was unlike any other event he has participated in during his overseas travel as president. He spent about two hours on an outdoor viewing platform, an unusual amount of time given Secret Service security concerns. Mr Obama nodded in approval as Indian tanks and rocket launchers, some of them Russian-made, rolled down the parade route and air force jets sped by overhead.

Republic Day marks the anniversary of India's democratic constitution taking force in 1950. Beyond the show of military power, the parade included ornate floats highlighting India's cultural diversity. Obama gave a thumbs-up to the acrobatic balancing act of several groups of men on motorbikes, while Mrs Obama smiled broadly at dance performance by young children.

Following the parade, the Obamas were to attend a reception with dignitaries at Rashtrapati Bhawan, the sprawling presidential palace.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation for Mr Obama to attend the parade surprised White House officials. After some internal deliberation, Mr Obama ultimately decided to attend and has sought to use the visit to turn his burgeoning personal friendship with Modi into policy breakthroughs.
