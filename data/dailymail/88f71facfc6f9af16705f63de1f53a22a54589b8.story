Congratulations to Amber Heard and Johnny Depp who are now officially married! Our collective hearts are broken but we'll do our best to be happy for them.

Amber is, of course, a beauty and this picture of the happy couple in January gives us some idea of how she might have looked on their wedding day. This dress is vintage Dior and we love the draped neckline and ivory silk.

Cut on the bias, this dress skims the body beautifully but is unforgiving in its clinginess. Yet Amber pulls it off in style, looking ethereal and angelic, accessorizing with a diamond bracelet, red nails and slick of deep red lipstick. Gorgeous!

Recreating this look is easier than you might think with our edit of floor-sweeping frocks below including picks from ASOS, Urban Outfitters and Missguided.

Another source reported by E! recently revealed that Johnny couldn't wait to make Amber, 28, his wife.

The source said: 'He's completely in love and can't wait!'.

Despite their 14-year relationship and two children, Johnny never married French singer Vanessa Paradis.

However, it is not the first marriage for the actor, who was wed to make-up artist Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985.

Johnny was just 20-years-old while Lori was 25, when they married at a small family ceremony in Florida.  

Second time's the charm? Johnny married first wife, make-up artist Lori Anne Allison, in 1983 when he was just 20 and she was 25, in a small family ceremony in Florida 

Johnny spoke to Extra in 2010 about why he hadn't got married to his longterm partner and mother of his two kids, Vanessa.

'I never found myself needing that piece of paper,' he revealed.

'Marriage is really from soul to soul, heart to heart. You don't need somebody to say, okay you're married.'

He added: 'If Vanessa wanted to get hitched, why not. But the thing is, I'd be so scared of ruining her last name! She's got such a good last name.'

Johnny has previously dated supermodel Kate Moss for four years, and has been engaged to Winona Ryder, Jennifer Grey and actress Sherilyn Fenn.

Hitched: It seems it was love at first sight for the pair on the set of their 2011 movie The Rum Diary
