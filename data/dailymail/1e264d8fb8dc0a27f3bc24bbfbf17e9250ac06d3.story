Police are hunting for a woman who went missing after a Valentine's Day date with her boyfriend - and the unidentified couple she was last seen with.

Erica Alonso, 27, and her date went to Sutra Lounge nightclub in Costa Mesa, Los Angeles, on February 14, where they befriended another couple.

At 1.30am the couple gave them a lift back to Alonso's boyfriend's Irvine apartment in their red Toyota Scion FRS and all four went inside.

The couple stayed for two hours until Alonso and her boyfriend had an argument, police said.

At 3.45am, Alonso stormed out and drove off in her Honda Civic.

Police have not been able to locate her, her car, or the couple she befriended.

There is no sign of cell phone or credit card activity on her accounts.

In an emotional appeal for help, Alonso's brother Issac told KTLA: 'We're all very worried. We just want her to come home safe.'

Alonso, who has five siblings, lives with her mother and sister.

She is described as petite, 5'3", Hispanic, 110 pounds, with long brown hair and brown eyes.

Her four-door, white Honda Civic bears the license plate number 7FSS563.

'She’s just not like the kind of person to just take off and leave and not come back,' Isaac added.

Detectives have interviewed Alonso's boyfriend, who has not been named, and have appealed for the unidentified couple to come forward.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Orange County Sheriff's Department at 714-647-7000.
