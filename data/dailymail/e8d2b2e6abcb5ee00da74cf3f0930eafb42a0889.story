Firing improvised explosives with a range of around a mile, this is the homemade weapon of choice of the Free Syrian Army known as the 'hell cannon'.

The cannon has been widely used during the conflict in besieged cities such as Aleppo and usually fires out highly modified propane gas cylinders.

The improvised launcher is often used by the rebels as they only have access to small arms such as machine guns and have to make their own weapons and ammunition.

Before firing the cannon, the rebels wheeled the launcher into the street so they could put it in place before firing it

But the rebel group are said to take great pride in the cannon, with resistance fighters watching online videos and given a fact sheet on how to fire it.

The conflict in Syria began in 2011 in an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, which gradually descended into civil war after a fierce crackdown.

Now the country also face the threat from the Islamic State, who are occupying several cities in Syria including Raqqa.

Yesterday, pictures emerged of an ISIS terrorist in the Syrian border town of Kobane firing a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window.

The fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets, far larger than the standard size.

The picture emerged after a show of force from al Qaeda's Nusra Front, a rival group. They toured in a convoy around villages they said they had captured from Syrian rebels.

The cannon usually fires out propane gas cylinders, that have been highly modified, with the weapon having a range of about one mile

The U.S. have led airstrikes against ISIS fighters since September in a bid to harm the terror group's fighting capabilities.

But in a new interview published in a French magazine on Thursday, President Assad said his troops have noticed no difference since the strikes began and also dismissed the idea Syria had allowed ISIS to flourish.

He told Paris Match: 'You can’t end terrorism with aerial strikes.

The Syrian border town of Kobane has been left in ruins following fighting lasting for two months between ISIS militants and Kurdish militants, who are defending the tow 

Striking back against ISIS are Kurdish fighters, which include many women. They have played a major role in helping to defend the Syrian town

There are fears that ISIS has spread to Africa after the U.S. military confirmed they are closely monitoring reports that they are now training fighters in eastern Libya.

Army General David Rodriguez, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said it was not yet clear how closely aligned the trainees were with ISIS.

'We're watching it very carefully to see how it develops,' Mr Rodriguez told reporters at the Pentagon.

'Right now it's just small and very nascent and we just have to see how it goes.'

'Troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential. That is why there haven’t been any tangible results in the two months of strikes led by the coalition.

'In reality, Islamic State was created in Iraq in 2006. It was the United States which occupied Iraq, not Syria,' he said, adding the group's leader was jailed in a U.S.-run prison there. 'So who created Islamic State? Syria or the United States?'

In the interview he also vowed to remain in power and said the war against the Free Syrian Army and ISIS would be long and difficult.

The interview came as Islamic State militants launched an overnight attack against the last major Syrian military air base in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour.

The Local Coordination Committees activist collective and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights both reported the fighting for the airfield, which is just outside of the city of Deir el-Zour on the Euphrates River.

The Islamic State group already controls almost the entire surrounding province as part of its self-declared state in Syria and Iraq.

The heavy clashes began with a suicide bombing on a Syrian military position near the air base, the Observatory said, adding that at least 19 government troops and seven ISIS militants have been killed in the fighting.
