Peter Lewis channels his income in a way that potentially allows him to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in income tax and national insurance

Britain's highest earning council boss is paid £318,500 a year for a four-day week – but uses his own company in a scheme that reduces tax bills, it has emerged.

Peter Lewis channels his income in a way that potentially allows him to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in income tax and national insurance.

The 60-year-old works as  director of children’s services at Somerset County Council.

A recruitment agency takes a fee – typically 10 per cent. But even after their cut is deducted Mr Lewis would still be left with an annual income of £286,650 – more than double the £142,500 paid to the Prime Minister.

It has now been revealed the council pays the executive through his own private company, StubbsStorey Ltd, which is registered in Hampshire and is co-owned by his wife Lynn.

Unlike council employees, Mr Lewis can choose how much pay to take from the business and minimise the tax he pays. Using such an arrangement typically allows recipients to avoid paying income tax at 45 per cent and 12 per cent national insurance.

If Mr Lewis pays himself by dividends, he faces only flat-rate corporation tax – possibly as low as 21 per cent. As the company is also in his wife’s name, he could also pay her an annual dividend and they could utilise both of their personal tax allowances. There is no suggestion of any wrong-doing.

Last night Mr Lewis refused to comment on allegations he was behaving ‘unethically’ when approached at his Southampton bungalow. Asked why he wasn’t paying income tax in the usual way he replied: ‘How do you know I’m not?’

The tax avoidance scheme was criticised by MPs in 2012 after it emerged it was exploited by thousands of civil servants. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, called it ‘totally wrong’.

Tessa Munt, the Lib Dem MP for Wells in Somerset, said she wanted it to be made illegal for local authority employees to avoid tax in such a way.

She told the Sunday Times: ‘This sort of arrangement is exactly what drives the voters to despair about politics.’

Mr Lewis, who replaced  disgraced Sharon Shoesmith at London’s Haringey council over the Baby P scandal, was hired by Somerset last year.

The council, which is trying to save £18million, admitted the cost was ‘substantial’ but claimed there is a shortage of children’s services directors.
