A movie fan has renovated one of the most famous buildings in Star Wars after it was in danger of being lost forever.

Terry Cooper led a team which has repaired the desert home of young hero Luke Skywalker featured in the first film of the series.

The 'igloo' was built in the Tunisian desert where many of the scenes were shot near the remote village of Tataouine.

Sci-fi fan Terry, 42, visited the desert to see the Skywalker house - but was horrified to see it was crumbling.

Terry said: 'It's such an iconic building to fantasy fans.

'It was going to waste for the sake of a relatively small amount of money and effort to save it.'

Terry raised cash to preserve the iconic building - and other film fans said: 'May the force be with you.'

Hut nut: Mr Cooper (pictured), a keen sci-fi writer, sought help from fellow Star Wars fans to return the igloo to its original condition

Terry recruited other Star Wars fans to return the igloo to its original condition before it falls to pieces.

The fans from Europe and the US have re-plastered and repaired the plywood and chicken wire building working in blistering 115F heat.

Director George Lucas named the planet in a 'far far away galaxy' Tatooine after the dusty village in the Sahara.

He was one of millions across the world who watched the 1977 Star Wars movie - the first film in the original trilogy.

Striking back: Cardiff man Mr Cooper said the degradation of the site was 'quite dramatic' and without work could have been lost forever

A New Hope: Proud Mr Copper outside the finished igloo, which in the film was destroyed by stormtroopers from the Galactic Empire

The igloo home of Luke and his foster family was destroyed by stormtroopers from the Galactic Empire.

Terry, of Cardiff, said: 'I last visited the set three years ago and it was sad to see the structure falling into disrepair.

'The degradation of the site was quite dramatic and without work on it could be lost forever.'

Terry is a keen sci-fi writer who has penned the Kangazang! novels - and his first book was narrated for audio by former Dr Who star Colin Baker.
