Disfigured: Naomi Oni of Dagenham, East London, 
was permanently scarred after she was attacked on her way home from work
 at Victoria's Secret

A student who allegedly threw acid in her friend’s face said she wanted to have her raped, a court was told yesterday.

Mary Konye, 21, is also said to have asked Muslim students about where to buy a niqab, or Islamic veil, telling them she had to go to a Muslim relative’s funeral.

The court heard that Konye told a friend she planned to disfigure Naomi Oni, saying: ‘I’m going to mess up the one thing that girl has – her looks.’

Omolola Vincent, 20, told Snaresbrook Crown Court in North-East London: ‘She said she was going to throw acid on her. She told me she had acid. She bought it online.’

Miss Oni, 21, of Dagenham, East London, was attacked on December 30 on her way home from work. The Victoria’s Secret shop assistant suffered permanent scarring all over her body and her face.

She also nearly lost the sight in both eyes.

Konye is accused of following her home dressed in a niqab and throwing acid in her face as she got off at her bus stop.

Konye’s college friend Miss Vincent also said that Konye posted a picture of Freddy Krueger, the disfigured character from the Nightmare on Elm Street horror film, online.

She then changed her written status to: ‘That’s what you’re going to look like when I’m finished with you.’

Miss Vincent, a student, added: ‘As soon as I saw it I messaged her and I said "Oh my gosh, did you actually do it?"

‘She replied that even if she did do it she wouldn’t tell anybody.’

Miss Vincent, who had studied chemistry at college, told the court that Konye had quizzed her about the laboratory and had asked whether there was acid.

She added: ‘She told me she had acid. She said she bought it online. She said the acid was in her house.

‘It was [from] one of those dodgy websites. It was dodgy countries like Chinese type of places. When she was saying it she was kind of laughing it off so it wasn’t really taken serious.

‘Even when she was saying she had acid, she was saying it in not a serious way so we didn’t take her seriously.’

'Even if she did do it she wouldn’t tell anybody': CCTV Mary Konye wearing a niqab following Miss Oni as she walks through a tube station. Konye denies throwing acid in the face of her former friend

Konye, of Canning Town, East London, denies throwing or casting a corrosive fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure, disable or do grievous bodily harm.

She admits following Miss Oni and to being the person wearing a niqab.

The case continues.
