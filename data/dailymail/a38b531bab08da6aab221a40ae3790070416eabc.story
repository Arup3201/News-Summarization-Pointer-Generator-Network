Gabriele Angella must be getting tired of his visits to Dean Court being cut short after a dubious sending off within 32 seconds put paid to Watford's chances of overcoming Bournemouth.

A first-half penalty from Yann Kermorgant and Matt Ritchie’s second-half strike moved Bournemouth three points clear at the top of the Championship having played a game more than Derby in second.

One year ago in this same fixture Angella was sent off in a case of mistaken identity when his defensive partner Fitz Hall pulled Lewis Grabban’s shirt when he was through on goal.

Subs not used: Camp, Stanislas, Fraser, Ward.

Scorers: Kermorgant, Ritchie.

Booked: Cook, Arter, Elphick.

Watford (3-5-2): Gomes, Cathcart, Angella, Hoban, Layun, Watson, Tozser, Munari (Pudil 46), Anya, Deeney (Mensah 93), Ighalo (Vydra 68). 

Subs not used: Doyley, Savic, Bond, Byers.

Sent off: Angella. 

Referee: Lee Probert

Watford got the offence overturned and manager Slavisa Jokanovic is considering appealing again this time around as their was a man covering and Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson was far from goal when he was scythed down by the defender and Lee Probert produced the red card.

Jokanovic joked afterwards that he could not comment on the decision for risk of incurring a fine when he is paid little by Watford, but on a serious note added: ‘It’s simple; it’s wrong and strange. It’s not good for them and it’s not good for us. It’s not good for our supporters or their supporters. It was a joke.’

The visitors faced 89 minutes and 28 seconds – plus stoppage time – against the Championship’s top scorers who had already netted 57 times this season - and one of the leading strikers in the league in Wilson.

It was he who cleverly won the 34th-minute penalty, stroked in by Kermorgant, by turning into Watford’s Craig Cathcart to draw a foul.

Bournemouth deserved their first-half lead and it could’ve been more, but Kermorgant crashed an effort off the crossbar in the 26th minute after controlling Charlie Daniels’ left-wing cross and shooting with his second touch.

Watford were restricted to half chances. Ikechi Anya shot low, hard and wide across goal and Ben Watson poked an effort agonisingly wide.

As the second half drifted onwards Watford increased the pressure on their opponents and the game felt like one in which Bournemouth would need at least a second to seal it.

Ritchie duly obliged in the 57th minute by rattling a shot past Heurelho Gomes in Watford’s goal from a tight angle on the right to double their lead.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe admitted: ‘I’d be disappointed if I was the Watford manager. The timing of the red card makes it a bitter pill to swallow. The game had just started. Both teams were looking forward to a battle.

‘It’s a difficult one for the ref. He had to make big call. The decision changed the game.’
