Despite their physical and at times heated exchanges during the Champions League clash catching the eye, David Luiz has revealed that Chelsea star Diego Costa is a good friend of his and a 'top guy.'

The former Chelsea defender scored the equaliser for the 10 men of Paris Saint-Germain to send the tie into extra-time before Thiago Silva scored late on to send the French side through.

The Costa and Luiz duel was highly talked about but the Brazilian has played down the intent of their clashes.

He said: 'It is normal, Diego is an amazing player, a top guy and we have a lot of physical [battles]. We are friends and were together after the match. We know each other from before.'

Luiz has also attempted to make peace with the Chelsea fans and apologised after breaking his promise of not celebrating if he was to score.

'I respect everyone here and I was very happy here,' he added. 'I said I wouldn't celebrate if I scored but the emotion of the moment meant I couldn't keep [to that].

'The fact I don't score many goals means it is always special for me. I am happy with my team as we showed spirit and character.'
