'I would like to thank Louis van Gaal and the club for allowing me to do my rehabilitation and to train with the team at the Aon Training Complex.

'From my short time here I can already see this is a very special club. 

'The first day when I came here to the Aon Training Complex, I saw the big red letters of Manchester United. 

'For me, it is like a dream. I played for Barca for a lot of years and that is also a big club, I have loved the club all my life. 

'I think this is the same. It is a big club around the world with a lot of fans. 

'I worked with Louis van Gaal during my time at FC Barcelona and to have the opportunity to work with him here at Manchester United is a dream come true.

'United and everybody around United saved me and they looked after me, so I am very grateful for everybody around the world and for the manager for giving me the chance to be a United player.' 

Valdes has lavished praise on De Gea by insisting his new team-mate is the 'best goalkeeper in the world'.

He added: 'His performance every day and in every game shows everybody that his level is very high. He has had a great year and it is very nice. Now I think he is the best goalkeeper in the world.' 

Van Gaal, who handed a 20-year-old Valdes his Barcelona debut in 2002, has assured Manchester United fans that his latest signing has joined the club as an understudy to De Gea.

'I am delighted Victor has signed for the club,' said Van Gaal. 

'Victor is a very experienced goalkeeper and his record speaks for itself.

'I have said on many occasions that Manchester United will always be interested in the best players. 

'Victor has remained very professional throughout his rehabilitation from injury and has been very impressive during his training sessions with the first team over the past weeks. 

'He joins the club as the No 2 goalkeeper and is a great addition to the first team.'

Valdes played a major role in Barcelona's success during his 12-year stint at the Catalan giants, winning six La Liga titles and the Champions League on three occasions during his time at the club.

The Spaniard starred in two Champions League final wins against his new side in 2009 and 2011.

He will join compatriots De Gea, Ander Herrera and Juan Mata at the Premier League outfit and will add to the large contingent of Spanish speakers in United's dressing room.

The signing of Valdes could bring an end to Anders Lindegaard and Ben Amos' Manchester United careers as the goalkeeping duo have been told they can leave the club. 

United are now expected to focus their attention on tying Real Madrid target De Gea down to a new long-term contract as his current deal is due to expire in 2016.
