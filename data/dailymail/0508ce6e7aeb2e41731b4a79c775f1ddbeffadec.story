Fraudster: Juliet Clarke swindled two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by pretending to suffer from serious illnesses

A fraudster tricked two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by making up elaborate lies about her personal life.

Juliet Clarke told one man she was terminally ill in an attempt to make him give her money, and later pretended she had died after they broke up.

She pretended to another lover, a serving soldier, that she was suffering from cancer, borrowed money for a fictional uncle's funeral and told him she had had his children.

Clarke, 31, pleaded guilty to fraud at Plymouth Magistrates' Court in Devon yesterday.

Magistrates heard that Clarke dated her first victim for six months in 2011.

She convinced him she was terminally ill, and said that she was about to inherit £250,000 from her grandmother.

But after the couple split up, he noticed that she had taken more than £1,800 from his bank account - including £259 that she spent on a holiday.

When he tried to contact her, she sent him a string of messages pretending to be her father and claiming she had died.

Clarke met her second victim over the internet when he was serving with the military in Afghanistan.

She said she was suffering from both ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, and asked to borrow money for the funeral of an uncle who never existed.

When he broke up with her, she tried to get money from him by saying she was pregnant with twins.

She took a picture out of a pregnancy guide and pretended it showed her swollen stomach.

When her ex-boyfriend started to grow suspicious, she claimed to have had their children prematurely and sent him updates on their condition as well as photographs of them.

However, it later emerged that Clarke had never been pregnant at all - and had in fact been sterilised years before.

'This is confidence fraud characterised by a degree of planning,' prosecutor Jenny Cater said.

Clarke admitted three counts of fraud by false representation, and will return to court next month for sentencing.
