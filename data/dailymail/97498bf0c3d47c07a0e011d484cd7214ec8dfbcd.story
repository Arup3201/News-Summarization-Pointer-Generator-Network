A nasty car crash involving three cars in Pennsylvania was captured on video by a cellphone after a man noticed the erratic driving of a woman in front of him.

The offending driver, who was behind the wheel of a white SUV, was swerving all over the road on Route 21 in Uniontown, Fayette County, on Monday.

The man who filmed the incident, Kaecieo Bass, was returning from a delivery for their rental company with a colleague when he noticed the suspicious driving happening up ahead.

'I don’t know if she’s drunk or what’s going on,' Bass can be heard saying in the video, which was obtained by WPXI News.

Erratic: Video taken of the incident in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, first shows the car veering to the wrong side of the road, narrowly avoiding a crash

Dangerous: This is the moment the car makes an improper left turn, steering straight into the path of an oncoming car

Smash: The black truck traveling in the opposite direction smashes straight into the white car

Incoming: After smashing past the other car, the truck ricochets straight toward the men filming

Crash: The truck and the third car hit head-on, however there were no serious injuries

'They need to get their mind right.

'I hope nothing happens to them.'

At one ominous point, Bass asks his colleague to keep a good distance between them and the woman because he 'doesn't want to have an accident'.

However seconds later, the woman makes an improper left-hand turn.

As the two men start yelling, knowing what is to come, she is t-boned another car, which then collides head-on with the men.

Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.

However the female driver was transported to hospital.

Police have confirmed they are investigating the crash, which occurred between 7.30am and 8am.

According to WPXI, some have questioned why Bass didn't just call 911 when he saw the woman start swerving, rather than start filming.

'I was trying to get her license plate because we were going to call 911 right then and there, but we couldn't get close enough to see,' he said.
