Jodie Williams roared into the women's 200 metres final at the Commonwealth Games as the second fastest qualifier at Hampden Park.

The 20-year-old, a prodigious junior who now looks ready to win her maiden senior major championship medal, was very strong down the home straight as she came home in 22.64 seconds, taking second place behind Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare, the 100m champion and favourite to do the double.

Williams, who enjoyed a 151-race unbeaten streak over five years from 2005 but was cruelly ruled out of London 2012 with a hamstring injury, is helping lead the resurgence of British women's sprinting.

England team-mates Bianca Williams and Anyika Onuora joined her in tonight's final, the former winning her semi-final in 23.17secs, with the latter coming home second in hers in 23.02s.

In the men's event, Danny Talbot, who beat Adam Gemili to the British 200m title, qualified for the men's final in 20.47.

James Ellington and Chris Clarke went out in the semi-finals.

Jessica Judd, the 19-year-old from Essex, produced a fine display of front-running in the pouring rain to win her 800m semi-final in 2:02.26.

Home favourite Lynsey Sharp and England's Jenny Meadows also made it through to Saturday's final as fastest losers after finishing fourth and fifth in the other semi.

Wales' Brett Morse finished fifth in the discus with 60.48.
