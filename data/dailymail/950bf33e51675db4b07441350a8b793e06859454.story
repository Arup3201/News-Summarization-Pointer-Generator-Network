She may be recognisable across the globe as the face of the 'Chinese Girl' but Monika Pon has revealed she made no money from being in one of the most famous artworks ever.

Vladimir Tretchikoff's piece is one of the most reproduced art prints in the world and is expected to sell for up to £500,000 when it goes under the hammer next month.

However, despite earning the artist a fortune, Ms Pon said she was paid a tiny sum to sit for Tretchikoff and made nothing from its huge sales.

The Chinese Girl made artist Vladimir Tretchikoff very rich and was one of the most popular paintings of the 20th Century but Monika Pon, right, said she made no money from its enormous popularity

Her face has appeared on everything from mugs to wallpaper, as well as various pieces of Chinese Girl paraphernalia.

The South African, whose parents emigrated from China, told The Observer said: 'I've got no money from the painting.

'I was so stupid, so young. What did I know about business.'

Tretchikoff approached Ms Pon, who lives in Johannesburg, when she was 17 and working in her uncle’s laundry in Cape Town in the early 1950s.

He told Ms Pon, who was known locally for her beauty, that he wanted to paint her and despite being nervous, she said she felt she could not say no.

He gave her £6 for six weeks of sittings in front of his art students.

The original artwork was sold to a woman in Chicago and Tretchikoff claimed to have sold half a million large-format reproductions of the painting across the world.

Ms Pon, who is now in her 80s, was only revealed to be the Green Lady in 2011.

She recalled how she was told she was beautiful by friends and family but never felt pretty because, living in Apartheid-era South Africa, she was often subjected to racist remarks.

She described Tretchikoff, who died in 2006, as 'handsome and attractive' and that he made her laugh.

She enjoyed sitting for him but was less than happy with the end result.

Ms Pon said in 2011: 'To be honest, I didn’t like that green face. I thought it made me look ill.’

She went on to marry and divorce commercial traveller Pon Su-Suan and have five children. She has been with the same partner for the past 40 years.

Meanwhile
 Tretchikoff made millions selling cheap reproductions of his work directly to the public and although he was loathed by the critics, his art remained perennially popular.

While
 acknowledging he painted an early version of the picture in Cape Town, 
Tretchikoff claimed it had been destroyed by vandals and maintained 
until his death in 2006 that his model came from the U.S.

Experts think that he concealed its true origin through misguided fear of being sued for a portion of its earnings.

She said in 2011 : ‘I’m not boasting but it was my portrait that made Tretchikoff 
rich. The Chinese Girl was the best thing that ever happened to me in my
 not-so-nice life.’

The painting will be auctioned at Bonhams in London in March by the original buyer's granddaughter.

It is also touring New York and Johannesburg.

In his autobiography Pigeon's Luck, Tretchikoff wrote: 'In painting Chinese Girl I had a lot of experience to 
draw on. My mind and soul went into this painting, and perhaps there 
lies the explanation for its success. Somehow perhaps I caught the 
essence of Chinese womanhood.'

Giles Peppiatt, director of South
 African Art at Bonhams, said: 'The iridescent hues of Chinese 
Girl reflect Tretchikoff's experimentation with the possibilities of 
his colour palette: the green-blue patina-like effect of the sitter's 
face is uncanny, heightening the red of her lips and framed by her 
lustrous dark hair.'

Tretchikoff biographer Boris Gorelik said the painting is 'one of the most important pop culture icons in Britain and the Commonwealth in the 1950s to early 1960s.

'Today, even prints of the "Green Lady" in mint condition, which went for a couple of pounds in 
their day, change hands for hundreds of pounds.'
