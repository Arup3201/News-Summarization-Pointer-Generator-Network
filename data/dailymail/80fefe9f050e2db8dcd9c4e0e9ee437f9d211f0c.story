They're jean-ious! Spanx, who are famed for their super slimming shapewear, are launching a range of jeans this autumn

They're every curvy girl's secret when it comes to slipping into figure-hugging dresses and skin-tight skirts.

And now Spanx has expanded its slimming empire by unveiling skinny jeans complete with their secret shaping technology.

The brand - loved by Kim Kardashian and Princess Beatrice - claim to have combined the ease of a legging, the classic look of jeans and the shaping power of Spanx to create 'revolutionary denim leggings that keep you slim and on trend'.

The full-coverage denims have been 
designed with a wide, slimming waistband and a side zipper for a flat 
fit, smooth silhouette and comfortable shaping. 

The
jeans have been created with faux front pockets to make thighs appear 
slimmer, while carefully-placed back pockets have been added to create a
more pert looking rear.

Spanx
have curated the £91 jeans using Real Lean Denim, which uses dual-core 
technology that claims to keep its shape wear after wear, helping to 
avoided the dreaded bag and bottom sag or droopy knees.

'While
denim has always had a place in women’s wardrobes, it hasn’t always fit
or flattered the places we want,' said Spanx Founder Sara Blakely.

'We
combined your dream denim with our shaping know-how and invented a 
solution. No more squeezing into skinny jeans…we put the skinny in the 
jeans!' 

The Spanx Denim 
Legging Collection will be available in a number of washes and fabrications, 
such as classic indigo to rock star wax denim.

Priced between £60 ($98) and £66.50 ($108), each pair will be available in sizes small up to extra large when they are unveiled in the UK this autumn.

Don't sweat it! Spanx recently 
unveiled their Skinny Britches range in time for summer to help 
women look slim and stay cool at the same time

Famous fans: Princess Beatrice and Kourtney Kardashian are both fans of shapewear

  Over 36,000 body-shapers are manufactured each day

To date, more than 5.4 million Spanx Power Panties have been sold 
worldwide – when Oprah announced she’d 'given up panties' and only wore 
Spanx, more than 20,000 pairs were sold that day alone

Founded in 2000, Spanx is headquartered in Atlanta

During the eight-hour manufacturing process of Spanx hosiery products, more than 40 women touch each pair

After
kickstarting a shapewear revolution, the company now makes more than 
200 figure-fixing products – from back-fat busting bras to bum-boosting 
bodysuits
