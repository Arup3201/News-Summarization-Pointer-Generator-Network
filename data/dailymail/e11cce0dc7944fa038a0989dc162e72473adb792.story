The Royal College of Nursing last night accused NHS bosses of ‘sleepwalking into a crisis’, claiming that more than 60,000 health jobs will disappear as a result of budget cuts.

The NHS workforce in England has already fallen by 28,500 posts since May 2010, and another 32,700 jobs are at risk of being cut, the RCN claimed.

The number of qualified nurses alone had fallen by more than 6,000 between May 2010 and July this year, the union said.

A member of Royal College of Nursing protests against budget cuts on a march in London in October. The RCN say 60,000 staff could go

A report for the organisation’s Frontline First campaign said the cuts come at the worst possible time for the country, with a soaring demand for care because of an ageing population and more patients with long-term conditions.

‘The RCN believes that the NHS is sleepwalking into a nursing crisis in England that is drawing closer as the size of the cuts increase,’ the report says.

‘If the Government continues on its current path it will find itself stranded in a perfect storm of an ageing population with increasing healthcare demands, but without the adequate nursing workforce to deal with it.’

Local NHS trusts are responsible for making decisions about staffing levels, but the RCN said there was a lack of national oversight staff numbers.

The organisation is calling on ministers to prevent NHS trusts from ‘continuing with this damaging agenda of cuts’ that ‘impact on patient care’.

Cuts to nursing could have an 'impact' on patient care, says the RCN

RCN’s head of policy Howard Catton said: ‘The cumulative effect of those local decisions means that we are heading towards a crisis as far as the supply of nursing is concerned which will have an impact on patient care.

‘There has to be national oversight to make sure that we are getting the right numbers of healthcare professionals across the system.

‘If attention isn’t paid to this warning from us we are very, very concerned about what the impact on care will be.’

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the RCN, said a reduction in nursing training places meant the supply line of nurses was ‘being choked’.But health minister Dan Poulter accused the RCN of ‘scaremongering’.

He said: ‘NHS performance is strong - waiting times and infection rates are at record low levels.

‘To say that the NHS is in crisis is scaremongering and doesn’t reflect reality.

‘This Government fully supports the NHS and will put an extra £12.5 billion into the health services by 2015.’
