Willy Wonka eat your heart out, these marshmallow creations may be the most bizarre and inventive sweets we've seen all year. 

Including flavours such as strawberry with rose champagne and bacon with bourbon, these gourmet marshmallows are not your everyday sweet.

The posh treats are created by Vivéltre, an independent sweet maker, and hand-made using 100% natural ingredients.

A boutique sweet shop in Florida have created a range of inventive flavoured marshmallows 

The flavour combinations are certainly not what you would expect to see in your local corner shop with 14 different varieties ranging from the Nutella to the luxurious 'French Riviera', flavoured with rose champagne and fresh strawberries.

There is even a sweet treat inspired by the heated marshmallow, chocolate and cracker combination- the s'more. Made using vanilla marshmallow infused with chocolate chips and biscuits, it is all the flavour of the real deal minus the mess while camping.

Irina Bromberry is the creative mind behind Vivéltre who started making the inventive marshmallows after she was encouraged to by her son.

The unusual flavours include Nutella, the popular hazelnut spread

Two years after he asked her to make the fluffy sweets, Irina started Vivéltre from her home in Miami, Florida and she has been overwhelmed with the demand.

Irina says that coming up with the different varieties is something very personal and can take up a lot of her time. 

'I come up with the different flavours in all sorts of ways. Sometimes it's based on things that have sentimental value in my life - like the caramel and Nutella flavours - so I look for ways to integrate them into marshmallows.'

Irina Bromberry (pictured) says that people refer to her as the dessert alchemist 

Irina began creating the marshmallows for her son two years ago and has since turned her creativity into a successful business, pictured here- Chocolate ganache flavour 

Once Irina has an idea for a new type of sweet she has a meticulous method of constructing the marshmallow, making sure the flavour balance is perfect. 

'But other times I think of a flavour first and use complicated algorithms to find the perfect ratio of ingredients like I did with the Ultimate S'mores.

'They call me dessert alchemist around here.' 

Four months ago the company raised enough cash to launch via Kickstarter and hope to use their success to expand in to different treats.
