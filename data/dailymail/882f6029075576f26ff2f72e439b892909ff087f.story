An overly excited fisherman has filmed the moment a great white shark came within a metre of him while he was fishing off a jetty.

Clinton Bambach was fishing at Murrays Beach, south of Newcastle, on Thursday morning when the 2.5 metre shark started circling in the shallow water for an hour. 

'It was doing loops and chasing baits,' Mr Bambach told the Newcastle Herald.

'A bloke saw how excited I was getting as I filmed so he came over and slapped the water and the thing wheeled around...You could have stepped on it, it came in so close, in just two foot of water.' 

He filmed the shark, believed to be a juvenile, pacing the water about 50 metres from the jetty before his excitement took hold as it started coming closer.

'Wow, it's a great white, it's a great white... yeah,' he can be heard yelling.

'That was insane, a big great white.'

Clinton Bambach, who is a keen fisherman, said the shark was doing loops as it chased bait fish

Mr Bambach said the shark was drawn into the area due to the large amount of bait fish but reacted when another man started splashing the water.

'In my eyes, the shark has heard the splashing and come back to have a look at what was all the commotion, like a bait fish splashing the surface,' he said.

'But when he saw the human hand, it wasn't a food source so he didn't aggressively tail kick and attack that food source.

'Sharks are hungry and they will eat, but they won't just eat a human hand because he sees it splashing.'  

'Wow, it's a great white, it's a great white... yeah,' he can be heard yelling
