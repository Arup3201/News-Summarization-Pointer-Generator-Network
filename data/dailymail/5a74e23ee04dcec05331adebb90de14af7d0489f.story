James DeGale called Carl Froch ‘yesterday’s man’ as he was given an April date to fight for the IBF world super middleweight title which the Nottingham Cobra has just vacated.

DeGale, given the April 25 engagement at London’s O2 Arena as a 29th birthday present by promoter Eddie Hearn, says: ‘I would’ve preferred to challenge Carl for the title in the ring but it’s time to move on. He is the past now. I’m not fussed about Carl any longer.’

DeGale has found himself in the same situation as Froch when he was hounding Joe Calzaghe for a world title shot. Calzaghe retired undefeated without fighting Froch.

Hearn and DeGale's trainer, Jim McDonnell, refused to association themselves with that remark. 

Froch, meanwhile, is negotiating for two major defences of his WBA world title against Bernard Hopkins at the City Ground and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in Las Vegas.

Hearn confirmed also that George Groves is declining the possible opportunity of being the opponent for DeGale in the fight for the vacant IBF title.

Groves, who narrowly defeated DeGale in their first grudge match, was second in line behind No 2 contender, Andre Dirrell.

Negotiations with Dirrell to meet DeGale have already commenced, although the American is wary of returning to England after believing he was robbed of a decision against Froch in Nottingham. 

Hearn says: 'We will get a decision on Dirrell quickly by pressing for purse bids if he wants this agreement.

Froch has vacated his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May
