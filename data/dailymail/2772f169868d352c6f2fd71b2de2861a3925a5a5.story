A British tourist who lost her lower leg after a New York taxi ploughed into her, has revealed she was 'ready to give up' moments after the crash.

Sian Green, 25, from Blaby, Leicestershire, was sightseeing in Manhattan during a dream holiday, when she was hit by a cab and was later forced to have her lower leg amputated.

A year on from her ordeal, Miss Green, a fashion student at De Montfort University, has spoken of the harrowing moment she learned of a possible amputation as she was being rushed to hospital.

Miss Green was at West 49th Street last August when she was hit by the taxi, which severed her foot resulting in the amputation.

The Leicester beauty queen said the first she knew about her injuries was in the ambulance when a paramedic said to a colleague 'we have a possible amputee here'.

Miss Green said: 'When I heard the word "amputation", at that point I thought my life was over. I was ready to give up on everything.'

'When I first woke up after my leg had been amputated, I thought of my boyfriend. I worried whether he would still find me attractive and want to stay with me.

'And I worried about how my friends and family would cope.'

Miss Green was eating a hot dog outside the Rockefeller Center when a cab driven by Faysal Himon jumped the kerb.

Mr Himon claimed at the time that he was cutoff by a man on a bicycle, 41-year-old Kenneth Olivo, and then sped up to try and get around him, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle.

One year on from the incident Miss Green has gone on to complete her second year of university

One year on from the incident Miss Green has gone on to complete her second year of university and is now engaged to her boyfriend, William Lord.

She said: 'My family and friends have been fantastic. Some days I do feel a bit down but everyone is so positive.

'The way I look at it, I've lost a limb, not my life,'

'I tell myself every day that could have been so much worse. I'm so grateful to still be here.' 

Miss Green has revealed she still struggles to deal with the memories of the incident.

She said: 'I can't use certain perfumes, or body cream because they take me back to when it happened. The trauma is still there.

'But I'm shocked with how far I've come, I'm proud of myself.'

Sian received a prosthetic leg in November 2013 which enabled her to go back to University and live her life.

She said: 'The clinic was so supportive and the staff made it seem like what they could do was limitless.'

The sports fan now has three prosthetic legs, one for everyday life, one for swimming and her 'active leg'.

'The staff at the clinic have become like my second family, they made what happened so much easier.'

Incredibly Miss Green took her first footsteps in November, just three months after the incident.

She said: 'I remember thinking, "wow, I'm actually walking" and I broke down with relief.'

Now she wants to help other amputees by setting up her own charity.

'In my opinion, there is no such word as can't and I want to prove that to other people in my position who have lost a limb,' she said.

'I really want to help amputees by raising money for those who need specialist care.

'I want to help people who have lost a limb realise they can live their life again, and get some normality back. It doesn't have to be the end of the world.'

'Not everybody gets the help I had and that's why I want to set up a charity.'

Her sister, Stacey Green, 29, of Leicester, said: 'I'm extremely proud of Sian but not shocked. The last year she has been trying to concentrate on recovering and adapting to life as an amputee.

'We knew she would always be positive though. That's her, she dust's herself off and gets on with it. She has done so well.'

In December last year it was reported that Miss Green was pursuing a $27.5 million lawsuit against Mr Himon and the City of New York - a lawsuit she filed after law enforcement officials announced that Mr Himon would not face any criminal charges.

Miss Green's lawsuit against the city focused on the fact that Mr Himon's hack license should have been suspended before the August 20 accident because of prior driving violations.

Prosecutors told Miss Green in November that there was not enough evidence to demonstrate that Mr Himon intended to hit her. 

Passersby rushed to help Miss Green immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg. 

They were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office.

Mr Himon later told reporters he was so horrified by the incident that he didn't want to be a cab driver anymore.
