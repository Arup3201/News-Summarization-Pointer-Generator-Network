Two Illinois college students have been arrested and charged with the murder of a 20-year-old man last month, in what police say was a minor drug deal gone wrong.

Vicente Mundo, 20, a University of Illinois student, was shot dead inside the garage of his own apartment complex in Champaign on the night of January 25.

His body was found dumped by the side of the road about 16 miles away in Tolono.

On Monday police arrested Reginald James Scott, 21, and Daniel Gonzalez, 21 - both Parkland College students - and charged them with the first-degree murder of Mundo on Tuesday, according to The News-Gazette.

Murdered: Vincente Mundo, 20, was shot dead in the garage of his apartment complex on January 25

Champaign County Sheriff Dan Walsh said at a press conference that the murder was 'part of a pre-planned armed robbery involving small amounts of marijuana and cash'.

The pair wanted to rob Mundo of cash and three bags of cannabis, police said.  

However investigators believe the young man was shot in the head as he tried to flee Gonzalez's car in the parking garage of his own apartment complex in the 300 block of East Chalmers Street.

Mundo went to meet the two after receiving a call while at his friend's apartment about half a block up the road.

State’s Attorney Julia Rietz said it was Scott who shot Mundo dead, with Gonzalez behind the wheel. 

Gonzalez and Scott then allegedly drove to dump Mundo's body.

Mundo's family reported him missing two days later, on January 27. 

His body was then found near the intersection of county roads 1000 E and 900 N in Tolono on Saturday by a woman walking her dog.

'Great guy': The murder of Mundo has devastated his family and friends, who said he was a lovely person

Gonzalez's car, a Plymouth Neon, and the gun police believe that was used to shoot Mr. Mundo have also been recovered.

The death of Mundo has understandably devastated his family. 

 

'I don’t understand,' Mundo's sister, Julieta LaMalfa, told the News-Gazette.

'My brother was such a great guy.'

On Monday, family and friends remembered held a vigil outside Mundo's home in Chicago.

A second vigil was also held at La Casa Cultural Latino, a center for Hispanic students on the University of Illinois campus.

Tribute: Vigils for Mundo have been held in Chicago - his home - and at the University of Illinois 

'It's hard to believe,' Viviana Mundo, another sister, said.

'It's not fair what happened to him. I want justice for my brother.'

If convicted, Scott faces up to natural life, while Gonzalez faces a maximum 75 years in prison
