If Kim Kardashian has proven anything, it's that big bums are big business.

Kim, who was officially crowned 'world's best bottom', sparked a new trend for 'bacials' - that's bottom facials - and caused a 45 per cent increase in bottom enhancing procedures over the last 12 months.

And now, one high street store have created a pair of bottom-boosting jeans that promise to give you a derriere to rival the reality TV star.

Debenhams has unveiled a £45 pair of bottom-boosting jeans designed by Jasper Conran. MailOnline's Hanna Flint pitted the enhancing jeans, right, against her regular jeans, left

Debenhams has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all-important asset with a pair of £45 jeans.

The new denims, designed by Jasper Conran, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high-street chain.

According to the store, the Shape Enhancing Jeans are said to be flying off the shelves, purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure. 

FEMAIL put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a la Kim or whether it's all just a clever gimmick.

The secret to the new jeans' success? A clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve, promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year.

Control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect, while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect.

Debenhams also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear.

Speaking about the jeans, a spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Pictures of curvy famous women, from Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, to Pippa Middleton and Carol Vorderman, have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise, rather than minimise.

'Of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer, straight up and down silhouette. The only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out, but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful, instant booty boost.'

The jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear, which Bianca London, 25, tested out (left: regular jeans, right: bottom-boosting jeans)

So what did our testers think? Jenny Kershaw and Bianca London were impressed. 

Jenny said: 'I can't say I'm now the proud owner of a behind to rival Kim Kardashian but I like the lift that the jeans give. Everything is more defined and pert - and for £45, that's money well spent.'

Bianca added: 'The quality was really impressive and much more fitted and comfortable than my regular jeans, I think these would make a good investment piece and staple item in anyone's wardrobe.' 

Hanna Flint, however, wouldn't waste her money. ‘I actually think my bum looks better in the first pair of jeans!', she said.

'The darker colour and shape seems to give my rear more definition and lift while the other pair seems to flatten it.'
