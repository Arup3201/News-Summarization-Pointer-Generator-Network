What's the absolute worst thing a new partner can do in bed the first time you share one with them and are trying to get to sleep?

Surprisingly, most of us would rank being too liberal with the cuddles as more irksome than either having dirty sheets or even breaking wind, according to research.

Hogging the duvet and snoring also sat high on the list of biggest turn-offs for first-time mattress mates, and the results have now been developed into a guide to bed-sharing etiquette.

Too much cuddling has been voted worse than breaking wind, snoring or having dirty sheets when sharing a bed with someone for the first time

Participants in the study were also asked about the weirdest bed-sharing habits they had ever encountered, which included finding a third party's knickers beneath the sheets, having to share the bed with 30 cuddly toys, and being shown to a yoga mat and sleeping bag instead of a bed.

According to research from memory foam mattress specialist Ergoflex, 41 per cent of respondents said excessive cuddling was the biggest turn-off for a first-time sheet-sharer.

Second worst was dirty sheets, which 36 per cent of people found the most horrifying thing to encounter in the bedroom of a new partner.

And of the 2,003 men and women aged 18 and over from across the UK surveyed, 33 per cent said snoring was the biggest bedtime no-no.

Hogging the sheets or duvet rankled 28 per cent of those quizzed, while only 26 per cent said unwelcome bodily functions such as flatulence and burping were their biggest pet peeve with a new bed partner.

Snoring was voted the third most irritating thing a new partner could do in bed

Of those who selected too much cuddling as a turn-off when sharing a bed, 61 per cent were female, while the majority of those who found unwanted bodily functions a turn-off (51 per cent) were male respondents.

In addition, respondents were asked to name what they felt were the best things a partner could do when sharing a bed with a partner for the first time.

The most desired was finding clean sheets (40 per cent), followed by breakfast in bed for 35 per cent.

Thirty per cent of respondents also explained they'd like a new partner to give them plenty of personal space when sharing a bed for the first time.

People were also asked to share unusual anecdotes they'd encountered when sharing a bed for the first time with a partner....

A 23-year-old man in Newcastle was perturbed when he found that he had to share a bed with a girl's entire cuddly toy collection; totalling over 30 in total.

A 30-year-old woman from London said her relationship hit troubled waters when she stayed over at her boyfriend's house for the first time and discovered a pair of ladies' knickers in his bed... which weren't hers.

A 28-year-old man from Birmingham said he once stayed the night at a female acquaintance's house, but had to go into the spare room in the middle of the night as her flatulence got too much to bear.

A 40-year-old woman from Cardiff said one man slept on yoga mats and a sleeping bad instead of a bed, and a 36-year-old man from Brighton claimed he once suffered a night of no sleep when sharing a bed with a woman who insisted on falling asleep to the Glee soundtrack every night.

Ergoflex have used the results of the survey to produce a bed-sharing etiquette guide

Jed MacEwan of Ergoflex UK commented on the findings: 'Good sleep requires a few ingredients, not least a comfortable, quiet and disturbance-free bedroom environment, so it was no surprise to find that the most irritating new partner habits were the ones that disrupted sleep.

'Sleep deprivation as a result of a partner's night-time irritations it can often spell the beginning of the end for a relationship.

'We hope our bed-sharing etiquette guide will help couples avoid this fate, and encourage everyone to be a little more considerate when it comes to bedtime.

'After all, when you both sleep well you're far more likely to have a healthy and happy relationship.'
