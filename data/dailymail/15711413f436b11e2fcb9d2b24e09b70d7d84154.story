Naming Downton Abbey's beloved Labrador after the goddess Isis seemed like a good idea at the time.

But there are claims the pet could be on her way out - after she was dogged by comparisons to the brutal wave of Islamist violence of the same name.

Tonight's episode raises questions for the first time over Isis' health as she approaches a grand old age of between eight and ten, or 56 to 70 in dog years.

Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham, is seen looking at a morose-looking pet splayed on the ground and remarks: 'She’s terribly listless. I don’t know that she hasn’t picked up a germ.'

Lady Mary Crawley adds: 'She’ll have eaten a dead squirrel or something equally foul'.

Hugh Bonneville's Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham, then chimes in and says he will have the pet looked at by a vet.

To most it would seem like an innocuous point of conversation. Critics and devoted fans, of course, know the ITV drama's writers seldom raise a topic for no reason.

Isis made her first appearance in the period drama in its second series in 2011, replacing the earl's previous pet Pharaoh.

As the first series tailed off in 1914 and the second began in 1916, Isis - now appearing in 1924 - is likely to be between eight and ten years old, hardly immune to the ills of old age.

The yellow Labrador was named after the Egyptian goddess Isis, whose name means 'throne' and became one of the most important deities of ancient Egypt.

But the name prompted grim comparisons after the rise of militants branding themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as IS and ISIL.

One Downton fan account, Lady Mary's Eyebrows, tweeted: 'Is there a TV dog more unfortunately named than Downton's Isis?'

Jasper Goodheart said: 'You're gonna have to somehow change the name of the dog, Downton . Not sure Isis is currently a world favorite.'

Daily Mail feature writer Guy Adams chimed in: 'I fear that recent events in the Middle East have rendered the name of Lord Grantham's dog Isis deeply inappropriate.'

ITV has insisted the whole issue is a coincidence, adding that most of the current series was filmed before fans began pointing out the similarity in names.

The broadcaster does not comment on future plot twists, but a spokesman said: 'Isis has been the Crawley's family pet since Series 2 (2011) and was named after the Egyptian Goddess.

'Series 1 saw the family pet Pharaoh, with the same themed name.

'At the time the dog was named and up to and including the majority of filming of Series 5, no one was using that acronym to describe a terror group. It is an unfortunate coincidence.’

Many things other than the dog are named after the Egyptian goddess - including a U.S. metal band, a range of Ann Summers underwear, Oxford's student magazine and the International Student Internship Scheme.
