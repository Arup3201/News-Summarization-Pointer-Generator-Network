A fraudster paid for his sandwich using a 100 Euro note from the Early Learning Centre.

The fake note, which had the logo of the famous children's shop emblazoned cross its front, was handed over by the customer at a fast food shop in Newry, County Down. 

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers were asked to investigate the counterfeit currency after the owner, who initially thought the note was real,  was left out of pocket.

A real version of the 100 Euro note. Police in Northern Ireland have asked shopkeepers to be vigilant when checking currency 

Posting a photo of the note on their Newry and Mourne Facebook page, the PSNI said: 'Yep you are right you know, it's a pretend 100 euro note from a leading kiddies toy store.

'So why do we have it in an evidence bag I hear you query? Well it's in an evidence bag because it's evidence. Evidence of the offence of tendering counterfeit currency.

'I know, I know a kids play note counterfeit currency?? Well believe it or not this was actually accepted as payment recently in business premises in Newry. Actually!'

Newry is a city near to the Irish border where many businesses accept cash in both sterling and euro.

Police have now issued fresh advice for businesses to thoroughly check all notes thoroughly before accepting them. 

The PSNI posted an image of the counterfeit note on the Newry and Mourne Facebook page 

The PSNI added: 'If you work in a cash handling job please take 5 seconds to check all notes you are accepting, the first check would be look at the thing! The second would be to swipe a counterfeit detector pen across it, you can buy these online for pennies.

'Then consider the feel of the note. Clearly no checks were done on this note and that business is now 100 euro down plus the value of the goods it was used to 'pay' for!

'Isn't it as well the £ is pretty strong against the euro?'
