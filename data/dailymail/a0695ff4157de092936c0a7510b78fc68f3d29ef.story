A married mother-of-two has been charged with multiple counts of rape after admitting to having a sexual relationship with one of her teenage daughter's male friends.

Heather Salines, 38, has entered a not guilty plea to the six counts of aggravated rape after she admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old boy.

She also sent the boy, whose name has not been revealed because of the nature of the crimes, nude selfies which ended up leading to her arrest.

The investigation into the case began when a student at Belmonte Middle School in Saugus, Massachusetts reported that the boy was showing off the naked pictures that Salines had sent him.

The Boston Herald reports that the boy told police he had previously had sex with Salines and they had exchanged naked photos.

She was later questioned by authorities and admitted that they had sex on a number of occasions but the exact number of sexual encounters has not been revealed.

Salines said she had met the boy two months before they became intimate, and he had told her about the personal turmoil he went through after 'he lost his mother at a young age'.

'When I looked at him, he did not act like a 15-year-old... he acted like a grown man,' she said.

At one point early in the illegal 
relationship, he was alone at her house and they 'were kissing and that 
she was touching him over his clothing'.

'Things spiraled out of control,' Salem News reports, citing the charging documents.

They first had sex in a car in the parking lot of a Saugus-area park on March 17.

The Boston Herald reports that she pointed the finger at the boy for taking the trysts to the next level, saying that he was the one to suggest they get a hotel room since there was always the threat that her daughter could walk in on them when they were at the house.

The boy was friends with Salines' teenage daughter but the age and sex of her other child are unknown.

Salines and the boy booked a room at the local DoubleTree hotel on March 19, two days after their coupling.

'She said they became close, and she developed feelings that she was not proud of,' the police report states, according to the Salem News.

'She said she tried to renege but that one thing led to another.'

Salines now faces six counts of aggravated rape and abuse of a child, one charge of child enticement and one charge of disseminating obscene material to a minor.

The aggravated rape charges are by far the most serious, as the mandatory minimum for each count carries a 10 year prison sentence, meaning that she could face 60 years behind bars if she is found guilty.

She has been indicted by a grand jury and appeared in court on Thursday in Salem to enter her not guilty plea.

Salines was accompanied by her lawyer and a man that would only identify himself as a family member.

That relative told the Salem News that she 'has the full support of her family'.
