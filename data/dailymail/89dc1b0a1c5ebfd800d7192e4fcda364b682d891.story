Pictured: Paul Anthony Ciancia, pictured at right in his mugshot, is the 23-year-old man who opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday morning, killing one TSA agent and injuring three others

The motive for the Friday morning shooting at Los Angeles International Airport has not been confirmed, but a note thought to be written by the gunman is shedding some light on his thought process.

Shooter Paul Anthony Ciancia had 'anti-government' leanings and was reportedly carrying a note which said that he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs'.

The note was found in a bag that he was carrying- which was likely the same bag that he used to bring a semi-automatic rifle into Terminal 3.

Multiple sources have added that the note was signed with the letters 'NWO' which stands for 'New World Order'.

The conspiracy theory of a 'new world
 order' asserts that there is a secret group of powerful individuals who
 used their money and global influence to eventually gain control of the
 world.

The concept of
 the New World Order has many different strains that have evolved over 
time, and has come to include mysterious elite groups like the 
Illuminati and the Freemasons.

Some
 of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret 
members of the New World Order will order a coordinated coup d'etat in 
the United States and other powerful countries using black helicopters 
and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world.

Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory

Warning signs: In recent days, Ciancia sent multiple rambling text messages about his hatred and disgust with the government. His last text to his brother hinted that he was suicidal, so relatives called the police

The Los Angeles Times
 reported that in a note found in his bag, he wrote about his 
'disappointment with government' and how he did not intend to injure any
 civilians, only federal employees.

In
 addition to the note found at the scene, investigators are using some 
other writings of Ciancia’s to help build a case for what drove him to 
kill a TSA agent on Friday morning.

CNN reports that the suicidal text he sent to his brother just hours before the shooting was not the first one that scared family members.

In others, which were sent to his brother and father, Ciancia was said to have rambled about his negative outlook on life, his disgust with the government and his disappointment with his life in Los Angeles.

A federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff.  

'This was clearly a suicide mission... he did not expect to walk away from this,' the official told USA Today.

Such hatred of the federal government would explain why witnesses say he was clearly targeting TSA agents, as multiple survivors have said that the gunman asked them if they were members of the agency. When they said no, he calmly continued walking looking for his next victims.

Witness Stephanie Rosemeyer told the paper that she was waiting to board a flight and was walking near the food court in Terminal 3 when she saw a man carrying a gun walking around while wearing a bulletproof vest. 

Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim)

She said that she locked eyes with the man, who did not appear to be a police officer.

'He looked back at me and said "I don't like this." I took a step toward him,' she told The LA Times.

The man, who is presumably Ciancia, then shouted an expletive about the TSA.

'I decided to walk away, and then I heard gun shots and so I walked faster,' Ms Rosemeyer said.

A similar story was told my traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper.

'I was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr Saryan told CNN.

Lock down: Police are now searching his family's home in Pennsville, New Jersey (pictured) as well as the apartment where the 23-year-old was living in Los Angeles

He said that while he was going to get his shoes taht were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit it seemed to be a grazing wound.'

At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner- right when the gunman came up to him.

'(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said "TSA?" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 

'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon.

'If I had a TSA uniform I wouldn't be here talking to you.'
