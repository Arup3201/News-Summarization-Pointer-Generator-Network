Swiss star Stanislas Wawrinka has become the fourth player to cement his place at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.

Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are already certain to compete, and now the Australian Open champion has joined them.

Speaking to Sky, the 29-year-old said: 'It was my dream and goal to qualify again this year after the great experience in 2013. It's only my second time at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals and being part of this great event remains a childhood dream for me.

'The atmosphere in London is one of a kind and it means a lot to me to be there together with the very best players of the world.'

There are now four places remaining at the event and Andy Murray is desperate to secure himself a place in London.

The 27-year-old entered the ATP Tour 500-level event in Valencia to try to edge himself into contention for November’s finals.
