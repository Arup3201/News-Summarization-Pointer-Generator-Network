A bigamist married by the Archbishop of York was jailed yesterday over a £150,000 welfare scam.

Ugandan Rebecca Muwonge married three times under different identities to remain illegally in the UK and claim benefits.

In 1996 John Sentamu, who became archbishop nine years later, married Muwonge to Samuel Bisaso at Holy Trinity, in Tulse Hill, south London.

Two years later Muwonge, 47, married Bisaso again – this time in the name of a niece whose identity she had already used to enter the UK without permission.

And in 1999, despite never divorcing Bisaso, she married Crispine Atessa, a Swiss national.

Bisaso was later ordained by the archbishop, who is Ugandan, in that country’s Anglican church.

Both Muwonge and Bisaso were jailed for 18 months in 2011 for immigration offences involving sham marriages.

Muwonge was pregnant and gave birth to the  youngest of her five children behind bars.

But she was hauled back before the courts following an inquiry by Newham and Enfield councils into benefit fraud.

It also emerged she had pretended to be homeless to secure a London council house which she then bought cut-price under right to buy.

Although she had never worked she was given a mortgage by Santander after saying she worked in data input.

Three years later she sold the house back to the council for a profit of £70,500.

Muwonge, who lives in Grimsby, admitted false accounting, a benefit offence and obtaining property by deception.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the fraud totalled at least £147,000 and she was jailed for two and a half years.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Samuel Bisaso was a chaplain for the Mission to Seafarers church charity in Immingham, near Grimsby. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case.
