Flop: Engelbert Humperdinck performs 'Love Will Set You Free' during the Eurovision Song Contest in Azerbaijan

BBC bosses have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after spending £310,000 on entering another disastrous Eurovision Song Contest.

76-year-old veteran singer Engelbert Humperdinck opened the show in Baku, Azerbaijan on May 26, but gained a paltry 12 points and came in second last.

The BBC admitted today the failure cost them the equivalent of £45,000 an hour or 2,130 TV licences at £145.50 a pop, according to data released under the Freedom of Information act.

Out of 42 countries taking part, only Ireland, Latvia, Belgium and 
Estonia awarded Humperdinck's Love Will Set You Free any points.

Some critics are also shocked that the nations involved had to each pay hundreds of thousands to enter.

'The BBC paid £310,000 for the entry into the Eurovision Song Contest in 2012,' a corporation spokesman said.

'It is worth noting that as other broadcasters contribute to the Eurovision Song Contest the BBC is able to deliver a massive, live spectacle for a small fraction of the overall cost.

'The contest provides BBC viewers with over seven hours of programming across BBC One and BBC Three, making it extremely cost effective for a prime time entertainment programme.'

The cash is not believed to include the thousands more the corporation spent on hotel and spending money for its staff, Humperdinck and his entourage.

After Engelbert crashed to failure 
humiliated music fans called on the BBC to pull out of the Eurovision 
Song Contest after Britain's entry limped to a poor finish again.

British viewers flooded the web with calls for the BBC to quit the contest.

TV presenter Philip Schofield led the charge, announcing on Twitter: 'It's time to pull out.

'Not even Robbie [Williams] could win it for us, it's too political.'

Hundreds of viewers bombarded the BBC's Eurovision website, with many calling on the UK to withdraw from the 'biased' contest.

One said: 'It doesn't matter who we have represent us things will always be the same and that's political PULL OUT AND DON'T BOTHER WASTING ANYMORE TIME OR MONEY!'

Another said: 'Once again the voting has been political, when will we in the UK learn we are not liked and no matter what song or who sings it we will not get anywhere.

'It is time for the UK to pull out of this biased contest so we are not humiliated year after year.'

Swedish singer Loreen won the title for the Scandinavian country with dance track Euphoria, which romped home with a landslide 372 points.

Despite the low placing, Humperdinck insisted Eurovision was 'a wonderful experience'.

He said afterwards: 'I want to thank everybody, especially my fans around the world for their words of support. I did the best for my country, the rest was out of my hands.'
