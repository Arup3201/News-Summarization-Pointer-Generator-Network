Cristiano Ronaldo will battle Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, PETE JENSON argues why the Real Madrid and Portugal superstar should be crowned the world's best player.

The greatest individual feat in football in 2014 was Cristiano Ronaldo’s 17 Champions League goal-haul that smashed the scoring record for one season in the competition and helped Real Madrid finally land the their 10th European Cup.

For so long Ruud van Nistelrooy’s 12 goal-campaign for Manchester United in 2003 had set the bar but then first Messi with 15 and Ronaldo with 17 took the standard to new levels.

Ronaldo did so in a year when Real Madrid finally became the first side in football to win 10 European Cups. He did it when the pressure and expectation were on him and that’s why the Portuguese should win the Ballon d’Or.

FIFA seem to want the award to be a further glorification of their World Cup and would prefer a German won the prize because they won the World Cup in Brazil last summer.

But the World Cup is a team event won by the best team, this is an individual honour and just as in 2010 when there was no one Spaniard who stood out above all others in their brilliant World Cup-winning side, the Germans also had no one outstanding individual.

Manuel Neuer wasn’t even the best goalkeeper in the tournament so his place on the podium is contestable. If you want to pick a German player why not the irrepressible Thomas Muller or the impeccable Phillip Lahm in what was his final major tournament? Or even Toni Kroos, who has just been voted German player of the year in his homeland.

Neuer was also in goal the night his club side Bayern Munich were beaten 4-0 on their own ground with Ronaldo scoring twice in the Champions League semi-final. That was arguably the club performance of the year and Ronaldo was at the heart of it with Neuer the victim.

Ronaldo also shared the Golden Shoe with Luis Suarez for his 31 goals and if concerns over his fitness had not meant he had to sit out several key games towards the end of the season he would have scored more and even kept Real Madrid in the Spanish title race.

It wasn’t just his goals in 2014. He showed leadership and sacrifice working for the side and fully taking on board coach Carlo Ancelotti’s demand for team-ethic to override all striving for personal spotlight. 

He let that super-sized ego get the better of him when he scored the last goal in the 4-1 Champions League final win over Atletico Madrid, ripping off his shirt and posing by the corner flag as if he had baked the cake and not just been the one who put the cherry on the top.

But we should forgive him that – the emotion of winning the club’s most sought-after piece of silverware on home soil would have got to anyone.

It’s true after the rigours of the season he ran out of gas before the World Cup and the fitness issues and general circus that surrounded him while he was at Portugal’s Caminos training base in Sao Paulo state stayed in the memory longer than his performances.

A topless stalker, the Brazilian former ‘Miss bumbum’ beauty contest winner Andressa Urach had to be given a restraining order to stay away from him after trying to get to him while he was training and that all made for a very bizarre end to his season, especially when he was unable to let the football take centre-stage once he was back on the pitch.

But once recovered from the World Cup he has hit the ground running this season, racing to the 20-goal mark before most players have worn their new boots in.

No-one had the perfect year. Messi won no major honours with Barcelona and is perhaps fortunate to make the podium ahead of Diego Godin, who led Atletico Madrid to La Liga glory, scoring the winner in the match that made them champions, and scoring in the World Cup for Uruguay against Italy as his country qualified from Group D ahead of the Azzurri and England.

Angel di Maria, who was man of the match in the Champions League final and a scorer in both the Spanish Cup final and the World Cup quarter-finals, could also argue he had a better year than Messi.

This is not a ‘who is the greatest player in the world?’ competition. If it was, Ronaldo might also win it although it would be much harder to separate him and Messi. 

This is an achievement award for a calendar year in football and Ronaldo’s Champions League campaign is what should see him scoop his second FIFA Ballon d’Or.
