The much-criticised Trent Bridge pitch for the drawn first Investec Test has been rated as "poor" by the International Cricket Council.

Match referee David Boon made his judgment on the ultra-slow surface, which resulted in a stalemate between England and India.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has 14 days to provide its response to Boon's judgement.

Not good: The Trent Bridge surface has been described as 'poor' by the International Cricket Council

After the ECB has submitted its response, the council, will consider all the evidence, including studying video footage of the match, before reaching their decision on whether or not the pitch was 'poor'.

Twenty nine wickets eventually fell over an almost uninterrupted full five days in Nottingham, where there were two century 10th-wicket stands - including James Anderson and Joe Root's world-record 198 for England

A press release from the world governing body read: 'The International Cricket Council today announced that David Boon of the Emirates elite panel of ICC match referees, who was the match referee for the first Test between England and India in Nottingham, has rated the pitch used at Trent Bridge as 'poor'.

Clinical: Despite the reservations over the pitch, Joe Root - pictured alongside Alastair Cook - hit a record-breaking 198 runs combined with James Anderson

'In accordance with Clause 3 of the ICC pitch monitoring process, Mr Boon submitted his report to the ICC expressing his concerns over the quality of the pitch.

'This report has been forwarded to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which now has 14 days to provide its response.'

ICC's general manager Geoff Allardice and chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle will then consider the response and evidence before a final decision is made on whether the pitch was 'poor' and if so what penalty is in order.

If they were to reach that verdict, they will then decide if a penalty should be imposed in accordance with Clause 4 of the Pitch Monitoring Process.
