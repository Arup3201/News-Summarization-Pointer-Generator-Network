Gerard Pique is a target for his former side Manchester United and two other English clubs, according to reports in Spain.

Barcelona-based Sport claim that Chelsea and both Manchester teams have submitted offers ranging from £20-£24million for the Spain star.

The paper say that Jose Mourinho is hoping to replace John Terry, and believes he can bring the Spaniard to London in the same way he lured Cesc Fabregas this summer.

Manchester City, meanwhile, are desperate to sign the Barca defender as early as January, Sport claim, having missed out on his signature last summer. 

Mundo Deportivo also focus on Barcelona, claiming that Luis Enrique is set to try a new formation with both Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano in central midfield.

The tactical switch is intended to free the front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, in a style similar to Brazil in 2002 and Spain in 2010, claim the paper.

Elsewhere in Spain AS lead on claims from the La Liga president Javier Tebas that Cristiano Ronaldo would not have won the league's player of the year award if the voting was public.

'If it wasn’t private a Barca player would never vote for him,' Tebas told the Madrid-based paper, after the Ballon d'Or winner added another award to his personal haul.

Meanwhile, in Italy the focus is on Juventus' recent drop-off in form, after the Italian champions won just one of their last four games.

La Gazzetta dello Sport splash on 'Juve alert' and highlight 'away form, midfielders and the decline of Carlos Tevez' as manager Massimiliano Allegri's biggest issues.
