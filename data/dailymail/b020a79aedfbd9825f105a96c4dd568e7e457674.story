A New York father is celebrating New Year’s for a different reason than anyone else – his son kidnapped for 18 months to France has been returned.

Larry Hummel’s four-year-old son has finally been returned after his mother kidnapped him to France for 18 months, and he couldn’t be happier.

He told the New York Daily News that having young Sasha back in his life is ‘magical.’

‘It's beyond great. I was worried because we hadn't seen each other for so long, but all my fears about him not recognizing me are over. It's the best, like he never left,’ the overjoyed father told the paper.

The father’s wishes finally came true last week after the FBI told him they had found Sasha and his older brother living in France under false names, he told the paper.

Mother Maria Pfeifer had taken them from Los Angeles to a court-approved vacation in eastern Europe but never returned, he further explained.

‘She was basically on the run, paying for everything in wads of cash and forcing the boys to live like refugees in Slovakia, Germany, Switzerland and France,’ said Mr Hummel.

The feds tracked her down after an anonymous tip shifted their focus to France, and then to a town on the border with Switzerland.

The boys’ fugitive mother had grown out their hair and changed their names. Mr Hummel believed she was also turning tricks as a prostitute to make ends meet, something she had a history of in the past, he said.

Court records cited by the Daily News revealed Ms Pfeiefer was acquitted in 2010 of escorting without a license and a second count of prostitution was dropped.

Together again: Mr Hummel and his son look as happy as ever

Both Mr Hummel and Robert Pfeifer, the father of the older boy, worked to bring the children home – and last week they finally had success.

Both father arrived Saturday back in Los Angeles with their children.

‘I was really nervous about how much Sasha would remember because he was only three when he was taken, and I knew he'd be seeing me for the first time totally out of context in France,’ Mr Hummel recalled to the paper.

‘Within 10 minutes, we were playing together like old chums,’ he added.

Both men were married to the supposed prostitute for less than year, he explained.

The two fathers plan to keep the children close and allow them to see each other often.

Their mother is out on bail in France and faces extradition to the US to face charges of abduction.

Despite her facing jail time, Mr Hummel expressed hopes to the paper that she would ‘face the music’ so she could eventually ‘get back in Sasha's life.’
