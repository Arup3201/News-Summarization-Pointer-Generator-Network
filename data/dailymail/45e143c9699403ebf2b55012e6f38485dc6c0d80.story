Laurent Koscielny was sent home from the France squad with an achilles problem in a fresh injury scare for Arsene Wenger

Arsenal are the most injury-prone club in the Premier League – with Mesut Ozil's knee ligament damage the 890th separate injury they have had since 2002.

In research that won't surprise long-suffering Gunners fans, specialist website premierinjuries.com have gone through every pulled muscle and broken leg over the past dozen years and revealed that Arsene Wenger's men have suffered an injury nearly every five days and 100 more different knocks than their closest 'challengers', Manchester United.

Ozil, a World Cup winner with Germany, has been ruled out for up to 12 weeks with a partial knee ligament tear sustained in Sunday's 2-0 defeat against Chelsea.

Arsene Wenger has often bemoaned that his side are unlucky with injuries... but something has to change

Arsenal 891

Manchester United 794 

Tottenham 788

Newcastle 777 

Everton 666 

Chelsea 622

Manchester City 596

Aston Villa 578 

Liverpool 553 

He is one of eight Arsenal players currently unavailable for the first-team alongside Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and David Ospina. 

Laurent Koscielny was on Thursday sent home by France following an injury scare and may also be unavailabe for Arsenal's game against Hull on October. 

Wenger has ordered an investigation into the number of injuries his side have had recently. There was particular bewilderment how influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey could have sustained a hamstring problem after last month's draw with Spurs having been trained lightly and rested from other games.

The Arsenal manager revealed: 'We are getting things together, getting a report on all the different opinions – what happened to him, because it’s a real concern.'

THEO WALCOTT 

Called into the England squad at 17, Walcott's career has been dogged by injuries since. He hasn't played since January after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee against Tottenham, and missed the World Cup in Brazil.

TOMAS ROSICKY 

Averaged fewer than 20 games a season for Arsenal since signing in 2006 with ankle and hamstring problems a major factor. 

His worse spell out came when he limped off against Newcastle with a hamstring tear in January 2008 and didn't play again until the September of the following year.

JACK WILSHERE

Had a stop-start career at Arsenal due to injuries despite making his debut for the club at 16. Missed the entire 2011-12 season after a stress fracture ankle injury sustained in a pre-season friendly against New York Red Bulls.

AARON RAMSEY 

Arsene Wenger claimed it took Ramsey three years to fully get over the double-break of his leg after a challenge by Ryan Shawcross of Stoke City in 2010. 

The fall-out caused bad blood between the two clubs with Stoke arguing that Shawcross had become a scapegoat when it was an honest challenge for the ball.

EDUARDO  

Suffered a sickening broken leg against Birmingham City in 2008 that ended Arsenal's title challenge that season and effectively Eduardo's career at Arsenal. 

Although the Brazilian-born Croatia forward did return to play for the first-team, he never reached his previous heights and was sold in 2010.

ABOU DIABY

Supposed to be the long-term successor to Patrick Vieira, Diaby's career was damaged when he broke his ankle after a bad tackle on him by Sunderland's Dan Smith in 2006. 

Still to make his 100th Premier League start for the club despite being the club's longest-serving player.

But the underlying statistics hint at a longer-term problem at the club. Since they won the Double in 2002, Arsenal have picked up nearly two fresh injuries a week during season-time with some of their stars particularly affected, notably Walcott, Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky and Abou Diaby.

Their total number of injuries, 890, compares unfavourably to other clubs over the same time period. Manchester United have had 794, Tottenham 788, Everton 666, Chelsea 622, Manchester City 596, Aston Villa 578 and Liverpool 553.

Newcastle United have had 777 injuries in the Premier League over the period since 2002 and that doesn't include their one season in the Championship in that time.

Mathieu Debuchy has been missing for Arsenal since picking up an injury against Manchester City last month

While Wenger is keen to improve the injury situation, he and Arsenal would argue that some of the more serious problems have been unavoidable.

Ramsey didn't play again for the Gunners for 13 months after infamously breaking his leg against Stoke City in February 2010.

Diaby's problems seemed to start when a bad tackle by Sunderland's Dan Smith caused a broken ankle that kept him out of Premier League action for nine months. 

Now Ozil is out and the bad luck continues.
