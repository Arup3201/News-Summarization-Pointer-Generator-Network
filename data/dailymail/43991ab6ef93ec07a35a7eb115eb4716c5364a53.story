The wife of hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin is demanding $300,000 a month to pay for around-the-clock access to a private jet, according to a recent court filing in their contentious divorce.

Even though Griffin says he has already given his wife Anne Dias $35 million as outlined in their pre-nup, she is demanding $1 million a month for 'child-related expenses', he claims.

He outlined her most recent alleged demands in a brief filed in court in Cook County, Illinois on Thursday as he seeks a definite trial date to resolve the divorce, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

As part of the extra $1 million a month, the mother of three is demanding $160,000 a month for vacation rentals, and $60,000 for an office space and staff for the children, according to his filing.

He said she is demanding such high figures because she realizes 'that she might have to start spending some of her own substantial wealth to support herself in the opulent lifestyle she desires'.

Dias has already accrued $35 million from the divorce and has a reported net worth of $50 million, according to the Chicago Tribune.

But a spokesperson for Diaz insisted that the filing was 'riddled with falsehoods'.

It is 'just another vindictive attempt by Ken Griffin - Illinois' richest billionaire - to punish his family and avoid his clear responsibility under Illinois law to maintain his children's lifestyle,' they said.

The spokesperson added that the children are being 'penalized' by failing to receive what is theirs.  

In the pre-nup, Griffin, the CEO of $20 billion Chicago-based investment giant Citadel LLC, agreed to pay his wife $25 million plus $1 million for each year they were married, leaving her with $35 million.

Dias Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003.

She has argued that the settlement leaves her with no real estate titles or any of the couple's costly possessions, including an extensive art collection.

Last year, Griffin hired a lawyer to represent his three children, aged two, four and six, in the settlement.

He is trying to ensure his family remain in Chicago, while his wife, who is seeking full-time custody, intends to move to New York. 

In earlier court papers, Dias claimed she has been banned from the marital residences in New York City, Aspen and Miami, and that she will not longer have control over the Chicago home she was promised half of in their prenup.

Among the real estate holdings Dias does not have any claim to, according to the prenup, are a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, four Palm Beach properties worth $130 million, and a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17 million. 

Furthermore, she says he husband will commit to no financial support 'on paper' but will give her money 'off paper' as long as she is a 'good girl'.

Dias claimed that she has been shouldering all the expenses for the couple's three children.

'Kenneth should be required to pay monthly child support to cover all of the children's expenses, fixed overhead expenses for the household, as well as child care, security, household and administrative staff, who should be reporting to Anne and under her control, not Kenneth's,' Dias Griffin said in her filing.

A rep for Griffin said the money man 'focused on the well-being of his children, and that has guided his every decision.' 

They then added: 'He has willingly paid all reasonable, and frankly, many unreasonable expenses throughout the separation, including millions in cash to Anne and a $10 million gift to Harvard in Anne's name. But when Anne takes things to a ridiculous level of extravagance and demands things like a $450,000 vacation to St. Bart's, enough is enough.' 

Griffin's worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion. He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990. 

Mrs. Dias-Griffin was a prominent name in the financial world herself, starting Aragon Global Management, LLC in 2001, but she left in 2009 to focus on her family. 

Their wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and  Donna Summer.

The couple separated in February 2012 and Griffin filed for divorce in July 2014 while his wife was on vacation in London with the children.
