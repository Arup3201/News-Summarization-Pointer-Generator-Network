More than $11,000 (£7,000) has been raised by a crowdfunding website for a Vietnamese tourist who endured humiliation at the hands of shop staff after they tried to charge him £940 on an iPhone 6.

Pham Van Thoai had saved up for months to buy the phone for his girlfriend and went to the notorious Sim Lim Square to make his purchase.

However, when he went into the Mobile Air shop, he was told the original deal of $950 (£595) had now become $1,500 (£940) due to the addition of an extended warranty.

Pham Van Thoa was distraught when he was presented a bill for an iPhone that was much higher than planned

Believing the warranty to be complimentary, he agreed, only to be told the higher price and that he had no option but to take it.

When he instead asked for a refund, it was refused, even when he cried and got down on his knees to beg for his money back - with one person filming the scene. 

Since the video of Mr Pham, believed to earn $200 (£125) a month as a factory worker, was posted online, donations have come in from all over the world.

People touched by his plight have raised $11,713 (£7,340) on a crowdfunding website.

A website was set up to help Mr Pham out, and it has raised almost £8,000 which will definitely be able to buy him an iPhone 6

After the police became involved in the in-store dispute, Mr Pham was forced to accept a $400 (£250) refund, and left empty handed, depsite originally spending £595.

The resulting crowdfunding campaign, started by Singaporean Gabriel Kang,set a target of $1,350 (£846), but after only being open for two days, reached $11,713 (£7,340).

On his indiegog.com page, Kang writes: 'This is NOT "ok", This is NOT right. We are NOT a nation of thieves and cheats. This kind of scam should NOT be allowed to continue here, much less prosper like it has. 

'But while I, as an individual can do very little to change this, together as a community we can put pressure on the lawmakers that allows scams like these to thrive over the last few years.'

'In the meantime, I feel that Mr Pham was dealt a great injustice by the legal system and while we cannot undo those traumatic and humiliating scenes he has had to endure, we can try to make things right. Let's give the man an iphone 6!' 

Kang adds: 'We have raised more than the required amount. With the extra money I would like to give Mr Pham and his girlfriend an all expenses paid holiday back to Singapore to enjoy the dream holiday that was stolen from them. 

'There is also another incident at Sim Lim Square where an international student was scammed, I would also be diverting resources to help her.'
