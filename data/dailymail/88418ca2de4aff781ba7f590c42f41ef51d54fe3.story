For those whose worlds have been torn apart by the raging conflict in war-torn Syria, a rare blanket of snow provided some much needed comic relief as residents took to playing snowballs and building snowmen in the shelled streets.

Members of the Syrian Free Army were pictured in high spirits today as they dressed a snowman in combat uniform, even fixing a weapon in its twiglet arms, in the streets of Aleppo.

Elsewhere resources were replenished for the first time after much of the Middle East was brought to a standstill by the storm which saw the first snow fall on the region in 100 years.
