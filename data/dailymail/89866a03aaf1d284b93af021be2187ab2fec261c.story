Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe Bob Geldof’s comeback tour as coming out of retirement.

The 62-year-old Boomtown Rats frontman looked exhausted – frankly as though he was in urgent need of a cup of cocoa and an early night – as he performed with his band to sell-out crowds at the weekend. 

Not that his shiny snakeskin suit can have helped his bedraggled appearance – probably making him perspire even more.

Dishevelled: Geldof looked exhausted during his performance at the Vicar Street venue in Dublin

Geldof previously described the bespoke suit as a personal favourite. He told an interviewer: ‘[The suit] I can delightedly reveal cost just £350 to have made.

‘What else is a budget-conscious sex god rock star going to wear?’

Fans of the not-so-gracefully aging star watched on in dismay as Mr Geldof danced in white shoes and a creased black shirt.

The
frail star shook his sweaty silver hair as he jerked his limbs around a
microphone stand in front of the Irish New wave band.

The Boomtown Rats, who had hits between 1977 and 1985, reformed this year and performed in Dublin as part of a comeback tour.

Worth the cash? Geldof revealed one of the benefits of the tour is helping out his less affluent bandmates

Sweaty shuffle: Geldof looked bedraggled in his shiny snakeskin suit - a bargain at £350, apparently

Speaking
about the reunion tour which was prompted following a performance at 
the Isle of Wight festival this year, Mr Geldof said: ‘It will be good 
money-wise for a couple of the guys who haven’t done as well as myself.

‘Seeing
Hendrix and The Who and The Doors and Leonard Cohen in one hit there, 
it was a formative moment for me. I needed that in my belt.’

Geldof was performing with bandmates Pete Briquette, Simon Crowe and Garry Roberts.
