David Cameron has decided to send his daughter Nancy to a state secondary school as his wife is ‘very keen’ to give her children a ‘normal’ education, friends of the couple have claimed.

Nancy Cameron is now ten years old and her parents will have to submit their choice of schools in November.

Samantha Cameron is said to want her daughter to meet people outside their usual circle, claiming she wants her children to be judged ‘for who they are’ rather than being defined by their rarefied social status or their father’s job.

One friend told the Mail: ‘She’s very keen on a normal education for her children. Her children’s lives are abnormal enough. They have a strange existence as it is.

‘Being in a state school is a nice antidote to that. You get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers don’t go off and spend the weekend with Angela Merkel. The children can be socially fluid.’

The Prime Minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel that his education at Eton College makes him ill-equipped to speak for ordinary voters. 

And Mrs Cameron is the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield – a landowner descended from Charles II. She attended the fee-paying Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where the Duchess of Cambridge was also educated.

But her time studying fine arts at the University of the West of England in Bristol convinced Mrs Cameron that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds.

Her friend explained: ‘At Bristol she loved the fact that no one discussed which school they were from. It was all about what you were doing then and there.

'You were judged by who you were, not who your parents were or where you went to school.’

They added: ‘Sam’s very non-judgmental. She takes people at face value and makes up her own mind about people.

‘She wants a school where people don’t make assumptions about you based on the frame of your life, as that stereotypes people in a way that is genuinely unfair.’

The decision means that Mr Cameron is set to become the first Conservative Prime Minister ever to entrust his children to the state sector while in Downing Street.

Details of the couple’s thinking emerged a week after Education Secretary Michael Gove became the first Tory in that post to opt for state school for his daughter Beatrice, who won a place at Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster.

Beatrice Gove and Nancy Cameron, as well as her brother Elwen, currently attend one of London’s most sought-after state primary schools in Kensington.

Mrs Cameron, 42, is expected to visit Grey Coats but friends say the school might be too close to Westminster for Mrs Cameron’s taste. Other options are thought to include St Marylebone School in central London and Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, west London. Holland Park School – one of the first comprehensives in the UK – is also an option, although it is more usually associated with Labour grandees like Tony Benn.

Sources say the Prime Minister was ‘very behind’ sending his children to a state primary school and the couple are ‘now working towards’ choosing a state secondary school for Nancy. His allies say there is ‘no reason’ why they won’t make the same choice for their son Elwen, now eight.

Downing Street declined to comment but a source said: ‘The decision is still some way off. Nothing has changed since the answer the Prime Minister gave in November 2012.’

On that occasion, Mr Cameron said: ‘I would like my children to go to state schools, that’s my intention, and I think what’s happening in the state school system is really exciting.

‘What we’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice, more competition, more diversity and crucially higher standards. I want my children to be part of that and I’m very heartened by what is happening.’
