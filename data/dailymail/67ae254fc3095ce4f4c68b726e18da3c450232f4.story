Harry Redknapp endured plenty of frustrating days as Queens Park Rangers manager but his final one in charge was among the most challenging.

The 67-year-old quit after being told he needs knee replacements but maybe the decision would have been even harder had transfer deadline day at Loftus Road been more productive.

Redknapp knew his squad needed bolstering to drag themselves out of the relegation zone. It is why he wanted to sign Tottenham’s Emmanuel Adebayor, the striker he worked with in his previous job at Spurs.

QPR’s transfer spend since Redknapp took the managerial reins - at least £12million more than any other club outside the Premier League’s current top seven teams.

Rangers were so desperate to land the Togolese on loan they offered to pay three-quarters of his £100,000-per-week salary. But Adebayor made it clear on Monday morning that he had no intention of swapping life at White Hart Lane for a relegation battle.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was happy to do a deal with QPR but when Adebayor turned down the move Rangers, Levy then refused to let him go to West Ham, who offered to pay only 50 per cent of his salary.

QPR then turned their attentions to a swap deal that would have seen Mauro Zarate, only recently signed on loan from West Ham, return to Upton Park with Matt Jarvis heading in the other direction. Redknapp was excited about signing Jarvis, telling Sky Sports News of his desire to do the swap.

A deal was agreed but it collapsed minutes before the deadline because of a rule that stipulates a club cannot send back a loan player in the same window.

The fact club officials, led by head of football operations Les Ferdinand, dedicated a considerable amount of time to the deal is believed to have understandably infuriated Redknapp, who found it hard to comprehend that QPR’s deal-makers were unaware of the rule.

It meant Rangers’ only signing January signing was Zarate, a player Redknapp no longer wanted.

Since his arrival in January, Zarate played just 14 minutes of football.

And despite the club’s efforts to strengthen the squad, their lack of money – due to self-imposed financial constraints as they look to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations – meant Redknapp was left with a virtually identical squad.

Redknapp’s relationship with co-owner Tony Fernandes - who has been forced to spend considerable time away from the club in recent weeks due to the recent Air Asia tragedy - has always been amicable, but the businessman was not willing to spend much money on Monday, tweeting: ‘No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all players the manager asked for in summer. Our players are not mercenaries. Good guys. If something interesting comes up we will look at it. But I’m not optimistic. Given the right motivation, tactics and coaching we can achieve much more.’.

The arrival of Ferdinand, now one of the frontrunners for the job, is also said to have altered the atmosphere and dynamic at the club’s Harlington HQ.

Players arrived at the club’s west London HQ on Tuesday unaware of what was to come, despite the fact Redknapp had already made his decision and told those closest to him in the morning.

As is often the case, Redknapp didn’t take the session because of his health, leaving that task to his trusted right-hand man Kevin Bond.

But Redknapp was there, overseeing training – having his say at regular intervals.

After the ball-work session, players made their way into gym for a 45 minute weights session, before heading into the showers. Then Redknapp was gone. His assistants Glenn Hoddle and Joe Jordan followed last night.

As players emerged from the showers they were confronted with whispers. Many of them didn’t believe it at first given Redknapp’s normal demeanour earlier in the morning.

The players were shocked but they knew his knees had been troubling him.

Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey have been handed the reins for the time being, but who will be entrusted with replacing Redknapp on a permanent basis?

Tim Sherwood seems the logical choice. His old Spurs pals Ferdinand and Ramsey would certainly vouch for him.

Likewise, the feeling amongst the QPR squad is that it is Sherwood’s job to turn down.
