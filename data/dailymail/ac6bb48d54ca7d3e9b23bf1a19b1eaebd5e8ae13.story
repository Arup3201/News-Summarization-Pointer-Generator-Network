A foolhardy walker has been pictured nearly being swept into the ocean after getting too close to 40ft waves.

The reckless thrill-seeker risked his life on Wednesday by clambering over a craggy headland to get a better view of the ocean in Cornwall's Newquay resort.

Within seconds he was forced to cling on to the rocks, cowering as walls of water weighing thousands of tonnes smashed into the coast.

Terror: A walker was nearly swept into the sea in Cornwall when trying to get close to the waves

Close shave: The walker escaped unharmed, but coastguards have used the images to warn others about the dangers of the sea during stormy weather

Coastguards have used the images to warn other locals and visitors about the dangers of spending time on the coastline during stormy weather.

Witnesses to the shocking spectacle told how they feared the man was about to be swept out to sea.

They described him desperately hanging on until the waves subsided.

Officials said the pictures should remind those looking to get a glimpse of severe weather that they should be cautious about how close they get to the action.

Matt Pavitt, coastguard sector manager for North Cornwall, said people failed to realise that a single cubic metre of water weighs a tonne.

'I doubt anyone would like a one-tonne bag of water swung at them,' he commented. 'It's incredibly dangerous.

'We don't want to be the fun police, we just want to instil a bit of common sense. It's incredibly impressive to watch the power of the ocean but you have to treat it with respect.

'Less than a foot of water will knock you off your feet, so at the height we're talking about here you've got no chance of trying to stand up against it if it breaks over you.

'Our advice is to watch the waves from a safe distance, otherwise you're putting yourself in danger - and those who come out to rescue you.'

Danger: Many thrill-seekers enjoy watching large waves, but they should beware of the power of the sea

The images were captured by Paul Terry, who was on his way to beach to take photos of surfers riding the monster waves.

The photographer said: 'There were two people sat up by the headland, quite a way back, watching the spray.

'Then the guy in the green jacket decided to try and get as close as he could. All of a sudden a huge wave came in and he had to duck out of the way behind the rocks.

'It's pretty dangerous and a lot of people seem to do it. If people get swept off then it can be a huge drain on resources, the coastguards and the RNLI.

'People need to be careful. It's a buzz watching it - it's exciting, but you can still do it from a safe distance. There's a lot of power in that spray when it comes down.'
