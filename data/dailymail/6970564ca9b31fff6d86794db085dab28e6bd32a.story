She made headlines around the world and was branded a stalker when she was jailed for trying to sneak into a polo club where Prince Harry was playing in a charity match.

But China native Wen Qi, who lives in Toronto, insists she is simply an inexperienced journalist who wanted an interview, despite admitting it's not the first time she has tried to get close to the Royal.

The 36-year-old said she is nothing like she has been portrayed in the media, and claims she simply wanted pictures for the Christian webcast she produces.

'I feel sorry about what happened,' she told theÂ Toronto Sun. 'I want to say sorry 
to the Royal Family and the British Embassy and especially Prince 
Harry.'

Tell that to police, who have put her on an 'international watch-list' of people protection officers keep an eye out for at Harry's public events.

Local police spotted her near the polo grounds in Connecticut where the prince was playing in aid of his charity, Sentebale.

Despite being told the event was invitation only, officers later found her walking round the perimeter of the club.

Qi was taken into custody and charged
with third-degree criminal trespass and held on $1,000 bail.

When she 
couldn't pay this she had to spend the night in a cell but was taken to hospital after suffering from a panic attack.

The next day the charge was reduced to a minor infraction and she paid a $50 fine.

But while Qi claims to simply be an 
inexperienced journalist who didn't know any better, this is not the 
first time she has tried to get close to the Prince.

In February, she flew to South Africa
while Harry was in Johannesburg. When she tried to get in she was told 
it was impossible without a media pass and security clearance, which 
should have been arranged months in advance.

Not to be deterred, she then went to 
Washington D.C in May to try and get close to the young Royal but was 
turned away again because she did not have a media pass.

When she learned about the Greenwich 
polo match, she thought it would be her best chance to get some pictures
and maybe even an interview.

On the day of the Sentebale Royal Salute Polo Cup, she was once again turned away from the event without either a media pass or invitation.

She told the Toronto Sun that she was 
about to leave when the taxi driver told her to try and get in through 
the woods outside the polo grounds.

As soon as she did and proceeded to take out her camera, she was swarmed by police and promptly arrested.

Since her return to Toronto, Qi said 
she is ashamed and embarrassed about the way she has been portrayed as 
some kind of deranged stalker.

But still this has not deterred her.

'I want to say sorry to Prince Harry and the Royal Family,' she said 
sweetly. 'I wish they could forgive me and give me a chance to interview
him.'
