A rock which rested inconspicuously on the doorstep of a house for at least 80 years has been revealed as the biggest meteorite ever found to have landed in Britain.

The 200lb space rock, which is 1.6ft long, had been sitting by the front door of Lake House, a stately home near Wilsford-cum-Lake, Wiltshire, since the early 1900s. It is thought to have landed on Earth 30,000 years ago.

It had been thought that the rock landed in another part of the world before being brought to England by a collector.

But researchers now believe that it 
actually landed here some 30,000 years ago - making it four times bigger
than any other meteorite found in Britain.

Massive: The meteorite from Lake House which, at 1.6ft long and a weight of 200lb, is believed to be the biggest ever discovered to have fallen on Britain

Colin Pillinger, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the Open University, said he was '99.9 per cent' certain that the rock had landed in the UK.

'It's very unusual to find a meteorite this big in Britain,' he said. 'They are very unstable, they contain a lot of metallic iron which oxidises and the meteorite falls to pieces.

'So the only logical explanation of how such a big meteorite may have survived being on Earth for 30,000 years is that it fell on or near a glacier and was in a deep freeze for 20,000 years.'

The rock's significance first became apparent in 1991 when the family of the previous owner of Lake House decided to sell the property.

They took the specimen - which they called 'grandfather's meteorite' - to the Natural History Museum, but experts could not verify if it had been found in the UK.

The family had always assumed that their grandfather had collected the rock on his travels abroad.

But Professor Pillinger, who has been 
investigating the meteorite's history for more than a year, has now 
found photos showing the rock on the steps of the house before the 
family owned it.

The expert,
famed for his work on the Beagle II Mars explorer, believes the rock 
could have landed on Salisbury Plain 30,000 years ago before being 
picked up by druids.

They 
might have used it in the construction of a chalk mound - such as 
Silbury Hill near Avebury, Wiltshire, - which would have protected it 
from decay, he explained.

Professor Pillinger said: 'Along came some druids, scavenging on Salisbury Plain for strange or interesting stones, and it was picked up and used in a chalk mound.

'And the reducing environment of chalk - the anaerobic environment - would have prevented the iron from oxidising.'

He believes the giant fragment of asteroid was then unearthed by a previous occupant of Lake House, who added it to his collection of curios.

The meteorite, known as a common chondrite, is set to go on display at the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum in the autumn.

Adrian Green, director of the museum, said: 'It's not uncommon for exotic rocks to be built into burial mounds. And it's still covered in chalk which is the bedrock of the landscape.

'And it's colossal - it would take four people to lift it - and it's not aesthetically pleasing, so common sense dictates that this has not been shipped from abroad at ridiculous cost and significant effort, but that it came from the UK.'

The rock is on display at the Royal Society in London as part of the Objects in Space exhibition until March 31
