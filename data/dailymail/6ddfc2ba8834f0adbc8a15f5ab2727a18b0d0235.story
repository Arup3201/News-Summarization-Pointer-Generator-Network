Innovative: Tim Waterstone is reintroducing serialised novels to readers in the form of e-books

The serialised novel, made famous by Victorian authors such as Charles Dickens, could be about to make an unlikely comeback - in digital form.

The founder of Waterstones is capitalising on the success of e-books to launch a new company offering short stories, journalism and extracts from longer books, aimed at users of mobile devices.

Read Petite will use a subscription-based model to attract customers, prompting comparisons to Spotify, but unlike the music streaming service it will be heavily curated in a bid to avoid a 'slush pile' of mediocre material.

Tim Waterstone, 73, has already revolutionised the High Street by introducing a national chain of high-quality bookshops for the discerning reader.

Now he hopes to do the same for the online world as well, re-introducing the art of the serialised novel and other neglected forms.

As paperback books became increasingly common and affordable throughout the 20th century, short stories and long-form journalism fell in popularity.

But now many people are believed to do most of their reading on tablets and e-readers while commuting on public transport, leading to a new hunger for more easily digestible reading material.

'It worked for Dickens and it worked for us,' Mr Waterstone told the Daily Telegraph. 'If you are going to read on a laptop or a smartphone or a tablet, it is about as much as you want.'

Venture: Read Petite, which is launching in the autumn, will offer a curated service of short-form literature

Dickens and his peers, such as Anthony Trollope, published most of their novels in serialised form via monthly magazines before issuing the complete hardback versions.

The opportunities for cliffhangers provided by serialisation provoked intense public interest - famously, New Yorkers flocked to the city's harbour to meet the boat carrying the final chapters of The Old Curiosity Shop in order to find out whether the novel's heroine Little Nell would survive.

The material published by Read Petite will be closely scrutinised by Mr Waterstone and his partners in order to ensure a high level of literary quality.

'The whole point is to avoid a slush pile of material,' he told the Guardian. 'What we'll guarantee is quality writing.'

They hope to attract established authors with a pre-existing fanbase, but will largely publish new works which have not appeared elsewhere.

The service, which will open to subscribers in the autumn, is likely to cost around £5-12 per month.

Mr Waterstone, who founded the company that bears his name in 1982 and left in 2001, has previously attempted to sell short fiction, but found it too difficult in the pre-digital era.

His is not the only bid to reinvigorate the book industry in the face of competition from Amazon and the supermarket giants.

Last month, Waterstones announced plans to include an extra chapter in the paperback edition of Joanne Harris' Peaches for Monsieur le Curé, the sequel to her best-seller Chocolat.

They hope the bonus offering will entice readers away from e-books and cheaper retailers.
