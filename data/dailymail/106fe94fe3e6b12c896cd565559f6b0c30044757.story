Host commentator

It's all over! Argentina are into the final 16 of the 2014 World Cup. Lionel Messi stepped up once again to hand his team three points with a stunning late goal. 

Iran had battled valiantly and deserved a draw, but you just cannot give Messi an inch. 

92mins: Di Maria makes way for Biglia. Iran have a throw-in deep inside Argentina's half but they look shell shocked. 

They've done it! He's done it! Messi the match-winner strikes again.  The little magician finds himself in space from 25-yards out, shifts the ball onto his left foot and curls the ball brilliantly past a helpless Haghighi. Wow!  

89mins: Iran now look like they are going to secure their second 0-0 draw of the tournament. 

Credit to Carlos Queiroz. Iran have been so well-drilled this afternoon. 

Argentina are pressing down the left with Di Maria. 

86mins: Chance for Iran to take the lead once again after a brilliant counter attack. Ghoochannejad was played through brilliantly and was running through on goal before just running out of legs and seeing his tame shot saved. Unlucky. 

82mins: Superb tackle from Sadeghi stops Lavezzi in his tracks and puts the ball out for an Argentina corner.

Alejandro Sabella's side have looked a lot more positive since the changes as Rojo fires a 30-yard strike just wide.

80mins: Di Maria's corner is turned away and it's Iran back on the attack.  Heydari crossed from the right but Argentina clear easily. 

The game is getting stretched now. 

74mins: Several changes now as Shojaei makes way for Heydari,  Palacio comes on for Higuain and Lavezzi enters the action at the expense of Aguero.

72mins: Shojaei is shown a yellow card for a foul on Di Maria on the edge of Iran's box. 

Messi stands over the ball...and hits the side netting!

71mins: Dejagah takes yet another corner for Iran which lands at the feet of Nekounam but he's adjudged to have fouled Garay. Let off for Argentina. 

67mins: Dejagah almost puts Iran in the lead! The Fulham star drives into the box before heading towards goal.

Romero is forced into a fingertip save. Iran are on top!  

64mins: Iran are really putting Argentina under pressure here as Reza almost capitalises on some sloppy defender inside the six-yard box.

Iran have looked just as likely to score as Argentina in this half. 

56mins: Replays shows that Zabaleta didn't get a touch to the ball and Dejagah was right to be so angry. Iran should have had a penalty there. 

55mins: Dejagah is absolutely furious after being tackled by Zabaleta inside the Argentina box.

The City defender looked to just get the ball before bringing down the Fulham star.    

52mins: Best chance of the game for Iran Nekounam meets the ball with a diving header. The attempt is saved by the feet of Haghighi. 

51mins: Aguero misses another chance as he fails to get on the end of another Rojo cross.

This time the ball was perfect and just needed a touch but Aguero completely miss-timed his header. 

49mins: Rojo attacks down the left before crossing for Aguero but the ball is too high for the City striker.

Argentina may have all the talent in the world in the front three but they lack any real height. 

46mins: Argentina start on the attack as a Zabaleta win a corner.  Timotian does well to clear.   

We're back underway in Belo Horizonte and Argentina take the ball. 

It's 0-0 at the break and it's no more than Iran deserve. Carlos Queiroz's side have been energetic and dangerous from set pieces while Argentina have struggled to carve the Iran defence open.

Chances fell to Higuain and Aguero but both were wasted. Can Iran really do this? No reason why not... 

47mins: Iran win another free-kick as Gago needlessly fouls Haji Safi on the left. Dejagah whips it in but Argentina clear.

45mins: Just two added minutes to play here and Argentina seemed to have lost their rhythm. Iran have battled well and had their chances from set pieces.  

42mins: Iran come close with a corner as Hosseini heads just over. It's a good run from Hosseini but he just seems to dip his head at the vital moment.

Iran are looking dangerous from those set pieces.   

36mins: Messi lofts in another free-kick and Garay is up to meet it, but he just can't hit the target with his header. Iran were lucky to get away with that. Garay was in acres of space.

32mins: Referee Milorad Mazic gets his vanishing foam out and that can mean only one thing. Messi takes the free-kick but hits it well over the bar. Disappointing effort. 

29mins: Iran are still hanging in there as Argentina keep looking for an opening. Chances have been few and far between for both sides.

Messi has just been fouled by Timotian on the edge of the box...  

24mins: Rojo heads just wide from an Argentina corner. The last thing Iran will want to do is gift their opponents a goal from a set piece. 

21 mins: Chance for Argentina as Higuain feeds Aguero inside the Iran box. The Manchester City forward looks to curl one past Haghighi left hand but the keeper is equal to the strike.   

Argentina in complete control here.

17mins: Iran take a corner but the ball is well cleared by Fernandez.

Argentina race towards the other end and find themselves with four against three but Higuain lacks the composure to make the numbers count.   

14mins: An excellent ball into the box from Gago puts Higuain one-on-one with the Iran goalkeeper but Haghighi saves well.

Haghighi has injured himself in the process and is currently receiving treatment.  

11mins: Messi cuts inside and gets away his first shot of the afternoon. Unfortunately for the Argentine faithful, his shot is easily blocked and sent out for a throw-in. 

9mins: Argentina have had 82 per cent of possession so far, but have struggled to carve out any real openings.

Di Maria bombs down the left before being halted by Hosseini 

5mins: Argentina have their first chance of the game as Aguero swivels in the area before seeing his shot blocked. 

4mins: Free-kick to Iran in a dangerous position after a Zabaleta handball.

Dejagah crosses, but the ball drifts out of play after a flick-on. If Iran are to have any joy this afternoon, they need to get those set pieces right. 

1min: Early free-kick to Argentina as Reza takes down Gago. Nothing comes of it as Di Maria lays crumpled in a heap and Iran regain possession. 

Here we go! Iran, all in red, get us underway. 

Matt Lawton: Respect to the women among Iran’s supporters here.

Read today that they’re not allowed to attend football matches at home.

It's Argentina first. The fans are making a lot of noise, but the players remain calm and silent.

The Iran players on the other hand, arm in arm and belting out every word.

1-0 to Iran in the national anthem stakes. 

Iran are the first team to enter the tunnel as they go through a few last stretches while waiting for Argentina.

The Iranian players were told to keep their shirts after the Nigeria game. Surely Messi's shirt will be a popular one after the final whistle. Got, got...NEED!

Matt Lawton: Seems Argentina players are getting their way again today after the controversy over Alejandro Sabella’s team selection for their opening game.

Messi wants 4-3-3 and 4-3-3 it is.

This will be the first time Argentina and Iran face each other at a World Cup. 

The two teams have only met once before and the match ended 1-1 in 1977. 

Those Iran defenders will have been having sleepless nights worrying about how they are going to deal with Argentina's front three.

The underdogs will be able to take heart from their hard-earned 0-0 against Nigeria last week but it might be slightly more difficult this afternoon.

A stunning effort from Lionel Messi secured three points for Argentina as the Barcelona star curled a left-footed shot past Alireza Haghighi in the Iran goal.

Iran will feel they deserved more, particularly after Pablo Zabaleta brought down Ashkan Dejagah inside the Argentina box. The referee decided to wave play on despite the tackle looking like a foul.
