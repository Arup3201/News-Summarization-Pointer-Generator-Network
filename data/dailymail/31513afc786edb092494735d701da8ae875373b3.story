A devoted husband has built what could well be Britain's smallest chapel in his back garden for his wife who only realised it wasn't a shed when he installed the stained glass windows. 

Jon Richards, 69, told his wife Muriel, 68, that he needed a proper shed in their garden in Studley, Warwickshire, with enough space to practise his wood work.

However, he was actually building a  private chapel complete with stained glass windows, antique pews and prayer books.

Mr Richards has built a private chapel in their back garden in Studley, Warwickshire, complete with stained glass windows, antique pews and prayer books

The couple now hold regular services at the miniature chapel, which seats just 12 worshippers and could be Britain's smallest.

'It was a surprise for Muriel and at the beginning I just told her I was building a bigger shed,' said Mr Richards. 

'But the game was up when we started fitting the gothic windows.'

Mr Richards spent two and a half years perfecting the Chapel of the Crosses - which measures just 12ft by 8ft

Mr Richards spent two and a half years perfecting the Chapel of the Crosses - which measures just 12ft by 8ft and did not need planning permission - in his back garden, pretending it was to be a shed with 'space for a radio'.

Instead he was building a replica of their parish place of worship, the Church of Holy Ascension in Mappleborough Green.

'It was a gift for my wife - I wanted somewhere sacred and special for her,' he said.

Once the building work was complete, the couple toured the country's reclamation yards and scrap dealers to source original artefacts for their own private holy place.

The couple have travelled around the country to find artefacts to fill their chapel, including this bronze statue of Jesus (left) and a stone font (right) - which is too large to fit inside

'As the project progressed, we started travelling around the country to reclamation yards to find appropriate pieces,' said Mr Richards. 

'Finding all the ornaments was the hardest bit.

'Everything in the chapel was previously used in a church and that’s what makes it special.'

The centrepiece of the altar is bronze statue of Jesus they purchased at a reclamation yard in Bristol. 

'We discovered the bronze centrepiece at a reclamation yard in Bristol,' said Mr Richards.

The chapel is named after a ceremony which takes place in the village every Easter, when three crosses are placed on the hill where the couple live

Mr Richards says filling the chapel with artefacts was the most difficult part of his task

'Never realising the price of solid bronze, we were shocked that he wanted so much for it and so we left it there thinking we’d be able to find something else for the altar.

'But in all our travelling around we never found anything that was suited and so we went back to the dealer in Bristol.

'When we told him what we were doing he was so touched that he knocked lots off the price.

'He said that a small chapel was where a statue of Christ deserved to be.' 

The couple also rescued full-length pews from a church in Leominster which was having a refurbishment, but had to cut them down to just 3ft by 6ft so they fitted into the tiny building - seating two worshippers apiece.

Space was also an issue when it came to a church organ. 

Mr Richards had considered a scaled down instrument, but decided against it as it would have cut the capacity of the chapel by two.   

Instead built-in speakers play hymns from a CD player operated by Mrs Richards at the back of the church.

Mr Richards, who owns a number of holiday cottages, says he has no idea about the exact total cost of the project, but believes he has spent no more than £10,000 on his miniature place of worship.

However, he admitted that he probably would not have started the building work if he had known how much it would come to.

Once the chapel was completed, Mr Richards invited  local clergyman, the Reverend Andy Shearn to see the finished product.

He was overwhelmed when Rev Shearn suggested they hold occasional services there, and the vicar now hosts a mid-week service in the chapel four or five times a year, as well as Christmas and Easter services. 

'People are sometimes overwhelmed by their reaction when they enter,' said Mr Richards, who described his chapel as 'the most calming place'.

'At Easter there is a procession though the village and we place three crosses on the hill where we live - that’s why we named it the Chapel of the Crosses.'

'It’s nearly always standing room only.'
