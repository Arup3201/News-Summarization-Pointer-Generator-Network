More than 24,000 children are skipping school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes.

Official figures reveal a sharp drop in the number of schools giving permission for term-time holidays following a crackdown by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

But growing numbers of parents are taking children on ‘unauthorised’ family breaks, despite the threat of £120 fines and even court action.

So-called ‘middle-class truancy’ is linked to inflated prices imposed by travel companies during half-term, Christmas, Easter and summer school holidays.

Prices can be double normal rates and savings on the holidays often outweigh the cost of any fines.

Mr Gove tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children’s education.

Heads were previously able to grant up to ten days holiday a year.

But changes to the regulations remove references to the ten-day threshold and make clear heads ‘may not grant any leave of absence during term-time unless there are exceptional circumstances’, such as a family bereavement.

Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term last year despite the crackdown.

About three-quarters of these had been taken out of school without the permission of the head.Parents who fail to gain the consent of the head teacher risk truancy fines of £120 – or £60 if paid within 28 days.

The true figures for pupils missing lessons could be higher since the Department for Education realised late yesterday some schools had not been counted.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘We do not expect the error to have a significant impact on the rates of absence.’

DfE figures showed the percentage of school sessions missed due to family holidays dropped from 0.5 per cent in autumn 2012 to 0.4 per cent.

It followed a decline in the number of schools authorising holidays. At primary level, approved family holidays were cut by around half. They accounted for 4.6 per cent of absence in autumn 2013 – down from 9.1 per cent the previous year.

But unauthorised holidays made up 7.4 per cent of overall – up from 4.6 per cent for the same term last year.

The overall truancy rate at primary level crept up from 0.7 per cent of sessions missed to 0.8 per cent. Similar, but less marked, trends were seen at secondary level, where parents tend to take fewer term-time holidays.

In total, the equivalent of 258,700 pupils missed school every day between September and December last year through illness, holidays or truancy – some 4.3 per cent of lesson time.

This marked a decline from 5.2 per cent – 323,600 pupils – over the same period in 2012.

It meant school attendance levels have reached an eight-year high. At the same time, the number of children classed as ‘persistent absentees’ – those missing 15 per cent of lesson time or 18 months over a school career – also dropped, from 6.4 to 4.6 per cent.

It meant 278,305 pupils were deemed persistent absentees, down from 396,450 in 2012.Schools are issuing record numbers of truancy fines, up more than a quarter last year to 52,370 but four in ten parents – more than 21,600 – failed to pay.

Now Mr Gove is drawing up plans to claw back truancy fines directly from child benefit to ‘send a clear signal that children have to turn up to school and there’s a price to pay if they don’t’.

Education minister Elizabeth Truss said: ‘There is still more to do and we are determined to further help schools reduce absence and improve behaviour.’
