A 33-year-old man has spent five years and $100,000 in an effort to look like his hero - teenaged pop idol Justin Bieber.

Toby Sheldon is a songwriter from Los Angeles who has used Bieber's youthful features as the inspiration for numerous surgeries, including face fillers, a chin reduction and eyelid surgery.

Sheldon's obsession with his appearance began when he started having treatments to prevent his hair thinning at the age of 23, but really took off when a pre-pubescent Justin Bieber hit the big-time in 2008.

Sheldon, along with hordes of preteen girls, became enamored of the pop star.

'Once Justin shot to fame his face was everywhere and I all I kept 
thinking when I saw his picture was, "I want to look like him,"' Sheldon says.

Sheldon had already spent $8,000 on hair transplants to supplement his thinning blond locks, but he wasn't happy with the results.

He took a picture of Bieber to his plastic surgeon to demonstrate exactly how he wanted his hair to look.

'It took three transplants and a total of $21,000 to accurately lower my hair line, close off my temples and grow back my bangs,' he says.

Once he had perfected his Bieber-style hair, Sheldon, who admits to a phobia of aging, decided he wasn't finished.

Teen idol: 33-year-old Toby Sheldon wants his face to resemble Justin Bieber's

'By using Justin’s charming baby face as my 
inspiration, I’ve been able to restructure my entire look to maintain a 
much more youthful appearance through plastic surgery.'

Sheldon says he admires Bieber for his youthful good looks, if not his musical output.

'I
 didn’t necessarily listen to his music or fawn over him as a celebrity,
 but his face was just so flawless every change I made was modeled after
 him.'

In this quest, Sheldon has remodeled his features so that he bears little resemblance to the fair-haired, pleasant-featured man he was before his surgeries.

After his successful hair refurbishment, Sheldon had his face and lips plumped up with filler to look more youthful. 

Next, he had Botox and Aquamid injections in his forehead and temples.

In 2012, he spent $4,850 on eye surgery to lift his upper eyelids.

'But
 it took going to eight different surgeons before anyone would agree to 
operate on me as everyone thought I was crazy to be obsessing over such a
 tiny detail,' he says.

His most recent procedure, a three-part 
smile surgery, has literally turned his frown upside down in an effort 
to emulate his 19-year-old idol’s boyish smile.

Popular in South Korea, smile surgery has doubled in the U.S. in the past year.

'When I first sought out to look like Justin I only paid attention to 
specific aspects of his boyish look like his hair and the structure of 
his face,' says Sheldon.

Resemblance? Toby Sheldon acknowledges that he needs a few more procedures before he'll be considered Bieber's 'doppelganger'

'But the more I started studying Justin 
and young people in general it’s really their smile that gives them 
their youthful glow. If you look closely, you’ll notice that 
when younger people just barely have their mouths open they naturally 
show their top teeth, giving them a sort of natural and effortless 
smile.'

For $30,000 Sheldon's Beverly Hills plastic surgeon 
lifted his upper lip, turned out his bottom lip and turned up the 
corners of his mouth to give him a 'perma-smile.'

He also had 
liposuction on his chin to smooth out his smile and had the fat from his
 chin transferred to his hands, lips and under his eyes.

Even after a total of $100,000 worth of plastic surgery to look like his baby-faced idol, Toby says he still hasn’t achieved his dream look.

'I know there is more work to be done in order to make a full transformation into Justin Bieber’s doppelganger like a nose job and jaw reduction, which my surgeon has suggested.'

Sheldon proudly relates a story about being turned away from a liquor store recently because the staff didn't believe he is 33.

Although Sheldon's similarity to his teen idol isn't immediately obvious even after spending $100,000 worth of surgical procedures, he says he does get mistaken for Bieber.

'Between our similar hairstyles, baby faced smile and overall youthful appearance I finally look like Justin Bieber and I couldn’t be happier about it,' he says.
