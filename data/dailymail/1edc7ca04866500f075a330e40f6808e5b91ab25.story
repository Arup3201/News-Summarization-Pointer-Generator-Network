BBC pundit Steve McManaman does not believe that Manchester City will retain their Premier League title should Chelsea defeat Manchester United on Sunday.

The reigning champions were surprisingly beaten 2-1 by West Ham despite a second half onslaught that came close to earning the Blues a result at Upton Park.

Although McManaman insists that City are not playing poorly, he doubts that they will be able to catch Chelsea if Jose Mourinho's side open up an eight-point lead at Old Trafford.

Speaking on BT Sport, he said: 'No, I don't think they will bridge the gap if Chelsea take an eight-point lead. Everybody knows they are the team to beat.

'City played well but just didn't convert the chances at the right time.

'That was all that was missing, this was not a poor performance like other teams have had.'

First half goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho put the Hammers into a commanding position before an improved performance from City after the interval, including a stunning solo strike from David Silva, set up a tense finish.

Despite the result, McManaman claims the highlight of the game was Silva's individual strike.

'My moment of the match was Silva's goal. He's got great control, dancing feet, shapes one way and turns the other before finding the composure to curl it in.'

Fellow pundit Ian Wright added: 'When you can score goals like that - he has to get into that position more often'.
