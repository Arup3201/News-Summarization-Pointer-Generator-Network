A top university has been criticised by students for spending £1.4m on famous artwork while raking in £9,000 tuition fees and paying staff less than the living wage.

Durham University spent the money while kitting out their new £50m Palatine Centre with works by Picasso and Andy Warhol.

The building, which opened in October last year, now features a collection of work by 20th Century greats and pieces by north-east artists.

However, the decision to spend the money on the university's new building has been criticised, with the students' union calling the spending a 'total disgrace', while trade union Unison said it was 'appalling'.

Archie Dallas, president of Durham Students' Union, said: 'I cannot believe that the university thinks it is appropriate to blow that much money on art.

'Art is crucial. But this amount of money could be spent on student facilities, bursaries or, in fact, almost anything more worthwhile. In short, it is a total disgrace.'

Durham University has said developing its collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an 'essential' ingredient of the concept for the Palatine Centre, which houses key student services and the University’s headquarters.

The spokesman said: 'Durham University is a custodian of many fine treasures and developing our collections of graphic art and sculpture for public display was an essential part of the original concept for the Palatine Centre.

'Some of the artwork was specially commissioned and reflects the university’s academic strengths and the heritage of our region.

'The works that can now be viewed in the Centre, in the adjacent Law School and nearby public spaces represent a rich and varied presentation of 20th and 21st century art.

'The university organises free guided tours of the collection and staff, students and members of the public are encouraged to come and enjoy it.

'The Palatine Centre was part of the 
wider £60m Gateway Programme, funded through a mixture of capital grants
from the Higher Education Funding Council, university reserves, 
property disposals and bank borrowing.

'£294k was provided within the original project budget under the “per cent for art” scheme; the balance was funded from savings in the capital programme as a whole.'

Durham University student newspaper Palatinate fought to obtain figures as to how much the artwork costs after university chiefs hailed the quality of the art on display, but no costs were disclosed.

Its Freedom of Information (FOI) request was initially refused for 'security reasons', as University officials claimed they were worried that announcing the value of the works would increase the risk of them being stolen.

In April last year, thieves broke into the university's Oriental Museum and stole Chinese artefacts worth about £2m.

An internal review found the FOI refusal was overly cautious.

Because there was strong public interest in knowing how public money was spent, the decision was overturned.

The university said £294,000 was originally budgeted for art but the 'marvellous spaces' at the Palatine Centre led to a decision to buy more artworks.

John McDade, of the Unison union, said the university had 555 staff earning less than the living wage of £7.45 an hour.

He said: 'It is appalling that Durham University blatantly refuses to treat their lowest paid employees with some dignity... but are able and willing to spend a fortune on works of art.'

The university said the average hourly rate of its lowest paid staff was above the living wage once overtime, shift allowances and other supplements were taken into account.

The university said most of the art was freely accessible during normal opening hours and that all the items can be seen during free weekly tours.
