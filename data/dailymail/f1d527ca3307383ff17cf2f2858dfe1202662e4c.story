David Moyes has appointed Billy McKinlay as his assistant coach at Real Sociedad.

The former Watford manager held discussions with Motherwell and Crystal Palace about managerial and coaching positions but was keen to link up with Moyes on his Spanish adventure.

McKinlay, who was in charge at Vicarage Road for eight days, was in Spain on Tuesday to have a look at the Sociedad facilities and held talks over what job Moyes has in mind.

Moyes started off his Sociedad reign with a 0-0 draw at Deportivo and has been amiably assisted by the Spanish staff as he finds his feet.

He has started Spanish lessons but wanted a good coach who he can trust to implement his ideals and fellow Scot McKinlay is well regarded within the game.

McKinlay completes the technical team with coach, Asier Santana, physical trainer Karla Larburu and goalkeeping coach Roberto, while 27-year-old Xabier Ruiz de Ocenda has also been brought in.

Sociedad face Elche on Friday in Moyes' first home match.
