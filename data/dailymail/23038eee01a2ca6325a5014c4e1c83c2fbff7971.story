The family of a California girl declared brain dead after complications from tonsil surgery was running out of time Sunday to find a new facility to take her in and keep her on a ventilator.

A judge's ruling will allow Children's Hospital Oakland to remove 13-year-old Jahi McMath from life support at 5pm Monday unless her family appeals.

The family is now pinning its hopes on a New York facility after two California care homes withdrew offers to accept the teen.

Next steps: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal. Her parents now must find a nursing home to take her and a doctor willing to perform the procedures she'll need for transfer

Chris Dolan, the family's attorney, said he was waiting to hear from the New York hospital after its facility director and medical director speak. He wouldn't provide the hospital's name, saying the media attention could hurt Jahi's chance of being transferred there.

'The family is together, and today everybody is praying and being together,' Dolan told The Associated Press Sunday. He said no decisions had been made about legal options for Monday, and would not comment on progress with the New York facility.

The hospital said it had not heard from the New York, or any other, facility about a transfer.

'We need to be able to talk to the other facility to understand what it is they are capable of doing,' Cynthia Chiarappa, a hospital spokeswoman, said Sunday.

The hospital also said it would need to confirm there is 'lawful transportation' included in any plan to transfer Jahi, and written permission from the coroner.

'This is not transferring an individual in a vegetative state, but a dead body.'

Unexpected: After coming out of surgery, Jahi started bleeding for the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl on life support

Still hope? Last week, Jahi's family released this picture of Nailah Wakefield holding her daughter's hand. The family has until January 7 to get the girl transferred to a facility that will take her or face pulling her plug

Jahi underwent a tonsillectomy at the hospital on December 9 to treat sleep apnea. After she awoke from the operation, her family said, she started bleeding heavily from her mouth and went into cardiac arrest.

Doctors at Children's Hospital and an independent pediatric neurologist from Stanford University have concluded the girl is brain dead.

The hospital wants to remove her from life support, but the family said they believe she is still alive.

Before Jahi can be transferred, she must undergo two more medical procedures - the insertion of a breathing tube and a feeding tube, both of which would be necessary for her long-term care but which a nursing home is not equipped to perform.

The hospital has refused to perform the procedures.

'Children's Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice,' David Durand, its chief of pediatrics, said in a statement Thursday.

Douglas Straus, a lawyer for the hospital, said in a letter made public Friday that before the hospital would comply with the family's request to move Jahi, it would need to speak directly with officials at any nursing home to make sure they understand her condition, 'including the fact that Jahi is brain dead' - and to discuss needed preparations, including transportation.

'Children's Hospital will of course continue to do everything legally and ethically permissible to support the family of Jahi McMath. In that regard, Children's will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children's can legally do so,' Straus wrote in the letter.

He also said the Alameda County coroner needed to sign off on the move 'since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead.'

The letter was sent to Dolan after Dolan said he was preparing a federal civil rights lawsuit to force the hospital to outfit Jahi with breathing and feeding tubes. He said the hospital's refusal to cooperate violated her family's religious, due process rights and privacy rights.

Another hospital spokesman, Sam Singer, said Sunday in an interview with KRON-TV that Children's Hospital will facilitate a transfer if the family finds an outside physician to insert the breathing and feeding tubes needed to make it happen.

'We'll do our best, if it is within the confines of things that are legal and medically correct, to be of assistance to them,' Singer said.

'At a certain point, they have to be able to look themselves in the eye and realize that this young lady is dead and is not coming back under any circumstances.'
