A baby reindeer looked set to miss out on all the reindeer games this Christmas when her antlers failed to grow.

But luckily for six-month-old Kate, her inventive owner fashioned her a unique toupee.

Now she will proudly lead the annual procession - wearing a stylish antler wig made with fake fur.

I'll join in all the reindeer games! Kate looked set to have a miserable first Christmas until her clever owner crafted her a nifty antler wig to wear for the festivities

Faking it: Kate will lead a procession of 14 reindeers in Christmas performances in front of thousands of excited children

You'll go down in history! The little antlers look so natural on Kate that no one would know they weren't real

Kind-hearted Trevor Hill, 47, painstakingly crafted the fancy headpiece out of fake fur and old antlers so that Kate could appear at Santa's grotto.

Her antlers should have grown in time for her to lead the procession of 14 reindeers in Christmas performances in front of thousands of excited children.

Rather than disappoint anyone, Mr Hill spent hours in his workshop perfecting the special wig.

Mr Hill said: 'People don't even notice that she's got anything other than real antlers which is the mark of how good the toupee is.

'No-one knows when she is out and about during the shows - you can't tell the difference. She looks a lot happier now, at first she really looked like the odd one out.

'But I didn't want to disappoint the kids and she can now proudly lead the group as the head of the procession and leads the male reindeers around who pull the sleigh.

'We have got 14 reindeers and we use them for Santa's grottoes, special appearances and things like that.'

The unusual wig was made from old antlers belonging to fellow reindeer Will before being attached onto a metal frame and secured with a leather strap.

Mr Hill runs an animal sanctuary from his home in Bromyard, Herefordshire, where he lives with his wife Julia, 40, and two boys Stephen, 17, and Christopher, 12.

The sanctuary also houses wild birds and reptiles.

Mr Hill revealed how Kate was named after The Duchess of Cambridge after being born on the anniversary of the Royal Wedding.

Kate's fake antlers come from those shed by fellow reindeer Will, named after Prince William, who was born the morning of April 29, 2011 - they day the Royal couple got hitched.

Mr Hill added: 'I guess its quite fitting that out of 14 reindeer it was Will who gave up his antlers for Kate.

'Will was born at 8.30am on the morning of the Royal Wedding.

'But we couldn't believe it when we had another born on the anniversary this year - we just had to call her Kate. They are brother and sister though.'

Some of Mr Hill's other reindeer are named after Scooby Doo characters - his son's favourite cartoon.

He added: 'We had Scooby and Shaggy imported from Sweden six years ago. We eventually got the entire cast with Daphinie, Velma and Fred.

'It's great for the kids as they all can identify with cartoon characters.

'There is another member of the team who is white so the boys called him Casper. But most of the girls are named after flowers such as Lilly, Poppy and Rosie.'
