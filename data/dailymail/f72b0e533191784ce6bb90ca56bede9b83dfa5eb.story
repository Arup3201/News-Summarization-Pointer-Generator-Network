A successful researcher and science writer was asked to contribute to an obscure blog, but when she turned down the offer she was accused of being a 'whore.'

Dr. Danielle Lee, a post-doctoral fellow in zoology at Oklahoma State University, was asked via email on Friday to write a science blog for biology-online.com by an editor who went only by 'Ofek.'

Dr. Lee, who already blogs for the well-known site Scientific American, turned down the unpaid offer from a site she'd never heard of and was subsequently asked 'Are you an urban scientist or an urban whore?'

Weasely: Dr. Danielle N. Lee turned down an unpaid blogging gig at an obscure science site and was ridiculed for it by the editor

Understandably taken aback, Lee replied: 'DID YOU JUST CALL ME A WHORE?'

Ofek apparently did not know who he was messing with. Lee has since posted lengthy written and video responses to Ofek on the widely read Scientific American site, including screen grabs of her email interactions with the blog editor.

The interaction with goes pleasantly enough at first.

Ofek asked Lee to contribute to 'one of the largest biology websites' in order to gain exposure.

Then Lee inquires about compensation and Ofek informs her that biology-online.org doesn't pay its contributors.

Lee, whose blog
 is dubbed 'The Urban Scientist: A hip hop maven blogs on urban ecology,
 evolutionary biology & diversity in the sciences' wasn't specific 
in her reasons for not wanting to work with Ofek. Nor was she soliciting
 another email from him.

But she got one anyway.

‘Because we don’t pay for blog entries,’ asked Ofek. ‘Are you an urban scientist or an urban whore?’

Lee's response was quick and the wide internet exposure was immediate.

'DID YOU JUST CALL ME A WHORE?': Lee blogs on the widely read Scientific American site. She turned down the unpaid job and an editor named Ofek asked 'Are you an urban scientist or an urban whore?'

'Thank you very much for your reply,' wrote Lee in response. 'But I will have to decline your offer. Have a great day.'

Offended: Lee's blog, called The Urban Scientist is focused on urban science outreach. As a black woman, she took particular offense to 'Ofek's' accusations and created a widely viewed online response

'If you¿re a woman, a person of color, or from a lower socio-economic status, folks think they can get you, your talent, your expertise, and your energy for free,' said Lee. 'That¿s not available. So I hope you know that from now on.'

'I pimp game,' Lee said in her video response. 'I know how this works.'

She was referring to the game of scientific research and blogging. But she could have just as easily meant the internet revenge game.

'If you’re a woman, a person of color, or from a lower socio-economic status, folks think they can get you, your talent, your expertise, and your energy for free,' said Lee. 'That’s not available. So I hope you know that from now on.'

Unfortunately for Ofek, he won't have a chance to put his lesson into practice. Since the email exchange and Lee's widely seen and read responses, Ofek has been fired from biology-online.org.

Lee ended her video to biology-online and Ofek with a smirk:

'Ya’ll have a good day.'

'Ya'll have a good day!': Lee ended her indignant response with a sarcastic adieu, but Ofek will definitely not be having a good day. Since his comments and Lee's viral response, the blog editor has been fired from biology-online.com

A blog editor referred to as 'Ofek' responded by insinuating Lee, whose own blog is called The Urban Scientist, is an 'urban whore'
