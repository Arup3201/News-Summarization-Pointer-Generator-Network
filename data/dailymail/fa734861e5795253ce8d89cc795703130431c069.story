An eastern Ohio elementary school official will perform community service related to rape awareness in exchange for prosecutors dropping a charge that she failed to report rumors of a teenage sex and drinking party, state Attorney General Mike DeWine announced Wednesday.

Lynnett Gorman had faced a misdemeanor charge of failure to report child abuse or neglect related to the April 2012 party.

The accusation against Gorman arose from an investigation into other crimes associated with the  the notorious Steubenville rape case of a 16-year-old girl after a different party in August 2012, but it was not related to that case.

Gorman, a principal in the Steubenville city schools, must perform 40 hours of community service at a rape crisis or victim assistance center and talk to teachers and administrators in Steubenville about the importance of reporting child abuse and neglect, DeWine said.

She must also encourage the school system to host a speaker from the Ohio Alliance Against Sexual Violence during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April.

If she completes those activities, the charge will be dropped by June 1, DeWine said.

The attorney general said more can be accomplished through community service than jail time had Gorman been convicted.

'The interests of the community are served by having the principal acknowledge that she should have done things differently,'  DeWine said in a statement, adding:

'This is about the long-term healing of the community.'

A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Gorman’s attorney, Dennis McNamara, who previously said Gorman was accused of failing to report possible child abuse, apparently involving a teen sex and drinking party in April 2012 unrelated to the rape of the West Virginia girl later that year.

McNamara said Gorman learned about the party second- or third-hand while checking to see if her son had been involved.

Because parents of the teens knew of the party’s circumstances, 'I don’t think she had an obligation' to report it, McNamara said last month.

Last month the members school staff - including Gorman - indicted by a grand jury investigating the notorious Steubenville rape case and another claim from a second girl in the town were allowed to return to work on full pay, to the shock of the victims' lawyer.

Trial by social media: The messages over 
Twitter, Instagram and texts that were exchanged ona night of back to back parties in  August 2012 and the next 
day were central to the original case - and to the outrage it caused 
nationwide

Steubenville City Schools Superintendent Mike McVey, wrestling coach Seth Fluharty and Lynnett Gorman, Principal of Pugliese Elementary School, had been placed on paid administrative leave since November 25 when Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced their indictments.

But a meeting of the Board of Education of Steubenville City has seen them reinstated in their positions pending trial – a decision described by attorney Bob Fitzsimmons as ‘surprising’ and which he admitted has left him ‘shocked.’

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Fitzsimmons who represented the 16-year-old victim, raped by Ma’lik Richmond, 17, and Trent Mays, then 16, in August 2012 said: ‘I am surprised that the Board of Education put them back at this stage.

'Members of the community, of the grand jury, found that there is at least probable cause to support indictments on several felonies. I’m actually quite shocked.’

Mr McVey has been indicted on five counts: one of tampering with evidence, two counts of obstruction of justice, one of falsification and one of obstructing official business. Several of the charges he faces relate to a second ‘rape’ alleged to have taken place in April 2012.

The ‘victim’ of this alleged assault, four months earlier than the now infamous rape case, was a 14-year-old girl now also represented by Mr Fitzsimmons.

Mrs Gorman’s indictment, on the charge of failure to report child abuse or neglect when she had ‘reasonable cause to suspect’ that a child under 18 had been a victim of it, also links to a date on or about 12 April 2012.

Torn apart: Steubenvillle, Ohio, was thrown into turmoil by the high profile rape which brought with it allegations of cover up and corruption and public protests on the steps of the court

Mr Fluharty was charged with failing to report possible child abuse in August 2012.

Assistant coach Matt Belardine, in whose house one of the parties which culminated in the rape was held in August on four misdemeanors, inclduing allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and contributing to unruliness or delinquency of a child.

Steubenville Schools IT technician William Rhinaman has been charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction and perjury. His daughter Hannah Rhinaman have also been indicted on theft and receiving stolen property charges.

Mr McVey, Mrs Gorman and Mr Fluharty were all expected to return to work on Monday December 9.

All of those charged deny the charges.
