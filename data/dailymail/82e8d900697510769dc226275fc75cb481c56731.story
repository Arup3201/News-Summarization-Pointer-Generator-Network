Morrissey last night sensationally claimed the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge did not care about the death of her hospital nurse found dead after being tricked by two DJs in the hoax call scandal.

The 53-year-old singer, whose hatred of the British monarchy is well known, claimed Kate ‘feels no shame about the death of this poor woman’ after Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found dead last Friday.

Morrissey blasted the ‘dictatorship’ royal family for its ‘absolutely staggering’ arrogance and claimed he was ‘sure’ that Clarence House had ‘put maximum pressure on this poor receptionist and nurse’.

Kate, 30, has not spoken out directly about the mother-of-two’s death after the hoax call by Mel Greig and Michael Christian of 2Day FM in Australia, but Clarence House issued a statement last week.

A spokesman said last Friday that the Duke and Duchess were ‘deeply saddened’ to learn of Ms Saldanha’s death - and their ‘thoughts and prayers’ were with her family, friends and colleagues.

But Morrissey told 3News: ‘There’s no blame placed on Kate Middleton, who was in the hospital as far as I could see for absolutely no reason. She feels no shame about the death of this woman.

‘She’s saying nothing about the death of this poor woman,’ he told the New Zealand TV station. ‘The arrogance of the British royals is absolutely staggering. Why it’s allowed to be I really don’t know.

‘I’m sure the Palace and Clarence 
House put maximum pressure on this poor receptionist and nurse, and of 
course that’s kept away from the press. By this time next week, she’ll 
be forgotten.’

He claimed 
that Miss Greig, 30, and Mr Christian, 25, are scapegoats to distract away 
from the royal family and said: ‘It wasn’t because of two DJs in 
Australia that this woman took her own life.’

A Clarence House spokesman told MailOnline it would not be making any response to Morrissey’s remarks over the King Edward VII Hospital nurse and reiterated its statement issued last Friday.

'There’s no blame placed on Kate 
Middleton, who was in the hospital as far as I could see for absolutely 
no reason. She feels no shame about the death of this woman'

Morrissey

Earlier this year Morrissey, who lives in Los Angeles, slammed the ‘blustering jingoism’ of London 2012 and even compared the support of athletes to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s.

The Manchester-born star said: ‘I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. The spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand Britain.’

The result of a post-mortem examination on the nurse will be released at the inquest into her death at Westminster Coroner's Court tomorrow morning. The death is not being treated as suspicious.

Meanwhile, the family of Ms Saldanha are set to receive more than £300,000 from Southern Cross Austereo, the parent company of 2Day FM, through a memorial fund established in her memory.

SCA chief executive Rhys Holleran said: ‘We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund, we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time.’

Labour MP Keith Vaz has been campaigning on behalf of the nurse's husband Benedict Barboza, daughter Lisha, 14, and son Junal, 16.

'She clearly loved her job, loved her work (and) cared deeply about the health of the patients, and what has happened is a complete tragedy'

Prime Minister David Cameron

He has called on King Edward VII Hospital to hold a full inquiry and offer further support to her loved ones. It has been reported that the family did not know about the hoax call until after Ms Saldanha's death.

David Cameron paid tribute to Ms Saldanha and told the Commons that MPs' sympathies and condolences would be with her family.

Speaking at Prime Minister's questions, he said: ‘She clearly loved her job, loved her work (and) cared deeply about the health of the patients, and what has happened is a complete tragedy.’

Mr Vaz has also written to Mr Holleran claiming that his company has yet to make any direct contact 
with Ms Saldanha's family.

'I am concerned and disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any steps to assist the family'

Labour MP Keith Vaz

The MP, who is chairman of the House 
of Commons Home Affairs Committee, conceded there had been a public 
apology for the incident and its consequences through the media.

But he wrote: ‘I am concerned and 
disappointed that Southern Cross Austereo appears to have not taken any 
steps to assist the family.

‘There has been no written apology, no
 request for a meeting with the family and no attempt to travel to the 
United Kingdom to express contrition.’
