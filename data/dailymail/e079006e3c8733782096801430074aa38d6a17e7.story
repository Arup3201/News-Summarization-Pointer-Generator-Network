Marmite has triggered a ‘hate it’ backlash with a commercial that mimics animal cruelty TV documentaries.

Uniformed inspectors are seen raiding homes and shaming families to an emotive soundtrack from the BBC’s much respected journalist and presenter Michael Buerk.

One man is apparently left crying on his doorstep, while the faces of some children are pixilated to protect their identity – as happens with genuine documentaries.

Controversy: Marmite has triggered a 'hate it' backlash with a commercial that mimics animal cruelty TV documentaries

The premise is that these owners have neglected their Marmite which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors before the jars are re-homed.

The manufacturer, which trades on the marketing slogan ‘Like It, Hate It, Just Don’t Forget It’, appears to have misjudged the response of viewers.

After the commercial was seen during a break in Coronation Street on ITV on Monday night, the brand’s Facebook and YouTube page were hit with a critical backlash.

Among the many Facebook complaints, one read: ‘Your new advert is very bad taste. Animal abuse is no laughing matter and I think it’s very wrong to jokingly use such a subject as a marketing scheme to increase your sales.

Many animal welfare campaigners have hit back against the advert which they say makes a mockery of child cruelty

‘People would be more inclined to buy Marmite if you donated a tiny percentage of each jars sale to the RSPCA to show that you meant no disrespect to the hard work that it does.‘ 

Another wrote: ‘What on earth were you thinking?! Poor taste, at best.’ 

While a third added: ‘Disgraceful advert! The implications are dreadful and shame on Michael Buerk for taking part! Hope you take this off air straight away!!!!’

However, the critics were matched by a
deluge of positive comments from fans who enjoyed the humour and 
defended what they insisted was a funny message.

Marmite apologised to those shoppers who were offended on its website, saying: ‘Sorry you feel that way.’

It added: ‘The plot focuses on a fictitious world where teams of people are dedicated to salvaging unused jars and giving them to people who actually eat Marmite with the only animal that appears being a much-loved family pet. 

‘We worked really hard to create an ad that we hoped people would watch in the light-hearted way it was intended.’ 

The RSPCA said it understood the concerns of some viewers.

A spokesman said: ‘We understand that animal lovers are concerned on our behalf - people either love the advert or hate it.

'We plan to talk to the makers of Marmite about how we can work together on animal welfare.’ 

A spokesman for Unilever, which makes the spread, said: ‘It is never our intention to cause offence.

This is the first time Marmite has been on television for two years and we have made every effort to ensure that this commercial entertains anyone who watches it.  

‘It ranked highly throughout our rigorous testing process and with clear branding from the outset, as well as the comedic tone, we believe we have created an unmistakably Marmite ad – people will either love it or hate it and they certainly won’t forget it.

'We hope that everyone will watch and enjoy this commercial in the light-hearted way it was intended.’
