They say that nice guys finish last, but for Borussia Dortmund it seems that winning is less important than playing the game in the right spirit.

Jurgen Klopp's team may be struggling in the Bundesliga, but they refused to take advantage of an indisposed opponent during Saturday's game against Hertha Berlin.

During the first half Hertha midfielder Per Ciljan Skjelbred went down after a challenge while Dortmund were in possession, leading the players to halt the game temporarily.

It soon became clear that Skjelbred was not injured, but had merely lost his boot, yet the visitors refused to carry on until he was ready to play again.

The Dortmund back four, at the instruction of German defender Mats Hummels, simply passed the ball amongst themselves until the Norweigian had sorted himself out and given the thumbs up.

The 2013 Champions League finalists' fair play was applauded by their manager, but didn't do them much good on the pitch - Dortmund suffered their ninth defeat of the season to fall back into the relegation zone.

Still, while results may be going against them, Dortmund seem determined to improve their standing by playing football in the right way.
