Prince Harry was mocked for his poor academic record at school.

But almost 10 years on it can be revealed his classmates - now aged 27 and 28 - all made the most of their gilded £30,000-a-year Eton education.

Most have landed plum jobs in the city, finance or brokering.

Details have emerged as the politicians including Nick Clegg and Michael Gove questioned the role of private schools saying they caused rifts in society.

All 11 of Eton contemporaries pictured here have high-flying jobs - one even held a senior position at the Queen’s bank Coutts.

Many went on to study at Oxford and Cambridge and one of Harry's friends who he is still in touch with, James Lloyd, is a yacht broker in New York.

Another classmate, Charlie Billingham took a slightly different path to the rest and is now an artist and has held exhibitions in Edinburgh, while Edmund Cohen runs a company which hires out large manor homes for weddings and functions.

Harry, 27, left Eton in 2003 with two A-Levels, a B in art and D in Geography, and went straight to officer training at Sandhurst College in 2005.

Third in line to the throne, he was commissioned in the Blues and Royal - a regiment of the Household cavalry.

In October 2008 it emerged that Harry wanted to fly military helicopters and he passed his Apache flying test in March last year. A month later he was promoted to the rank of Captain having held the rank of Lieutenant since 2008.

Harry was in Manor House at school - also known as ALHG and named after schoolmaster Andrew Louis Hamilton Gailey’s full initials. The picture shows the class in 1999.

During his time at the Berkshire school he was house captain of games, and represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo.

Eton has educated 20 Prime Ministers including David Cameron, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan. They all wore the traditional Eton uniform, as did Harry and his friends, of black tailcoats and waistcoat and pin-stripe trousers.

Harry remains in touch with many of his school contemporaries and here is what his friends are up to now.

He now works as a trainee lawyer in the City of London after completing a BA in law and further professional qualifications.

Charles Billingham

The former Royal Academy student is now an artist who has held exhibitions in Edinburgh. While studying, he lived legally as a squatter in offices in East London which provided him with an art studio and explained: ‘It’s not that we were opposed to paying council tax, we just weren’t asked to. It was a lot of fun, there was a lot of space, and we had some big parties.’
