Three people were left bloodied and bruised after being hit in the face by flying golf balls in separate incidents on the first day of The Open – with one unlucky marshal being hit twice within the space of an hour.

One spectator - a man believed to be in his 60s – had to be taken to hospital after apparently being left injured and covered in blood when a shot by Ernie Els struck him in the face.

It came just a short time before a similar incident involving triple Open champion Tiger Woods, whose shot on the 17th hole was caught on camera smacking a course marshal in the face.

And, in further calamity, another course marshal was hit twice by flying golf balls as he patrolled the 16th hole.

He
 was left lying on the ground after a shot by Rickie Fowler hit his leg 
and, after getting up, he was struck again within 45 minutes by a shot 
from Charl Schwartzel.

All of the incidents occurred yesterday on the opening day of the golf championships at Royal Liverpool in Merseyside.

South
 African double Open champion Els, who later took to Twitter to 
apologise for his shot, said his ball would have hit the spectator ‘like
 a bullet’.

It was the first shot of the tournament for 44-year-old Els and veered to the left into the crowd of fans.

In
 the aftermath of the incident, he said: ‘It's obviously a dangerous 
shot and I hit the guy, who was probably in his 60s, right in the face 
and there was blood everywhere.

‘I
 felt pretty bad about it. I probably should have told the starter to 
move the people left on the left side, but I didn't do that.

Ernie Els (pictured above at The Open yesterday) offered championship tickets to the spectator who was struck in the face by one of his shots on the first day of the tournament. It came just before a shot by triple Open champion Tiger Woods (right) was caught on camera hitting a course marshal in the head on the 16th

‘I really felt bad hitting it there into the people and hurting the guy the way I did.

‘It was right in the face and you think the worst. It was like a bullet coming at him so he must have been in total shock.

‘Hopefully he's better now, but it wasn't very nice.’

Els’ opponent, Bubba Watson, who also witnessed the incident, described it as ‘heart-breaking’.

He said: ‘You could tell Ernie was shaken up by it. When you hit somebody like that it's not a good scene and it's very heart-breaking.’

The man was taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries, and reportedly received a couple of stitches, but was otherwise said to make a full recovery.

Els later took to Twitter to apologise for the incident and said he had sorted some tickets for the spectator so he could return to The Open over the weekend.

He wrote: ‘Really tough day today. Just spoke to the gentleman I hit on the 1st and happily he’s fine. Got him some tickets @The_Open this weekend.’

Woods’ shot on the 17th hole came after he shouted ‘Jesus Christ’ at some photographers for supposedly taking pictures of him at the wrong time as he tee’d off.

His shot was caught on camera and footage showed the ball hitting a course marshal in the face, knocking him sideways.

He is not thought to have been badly injured and is believed to have continued with his work on the course today.

His fellow marshal Bill Davies, who is the president of the Vicars Cross Golf Club in Chester, also felt the blow of being hit by a golf ball at speed.

He was marshalling the 16th hole on the course, when he was hit on both the leg and shoulder in two unlucky incidents.

‘I wasn't too bad, but having two detonating things happen to you within three quarters of hour, then you start worrying,’ he told BBC Radio 5 live.

‘Rickie was more interested first thing in the ball when I was lying on the floor. Anyway, he was very good about it; he said “I'm sorry”.

‘People came up to me and asked if I can get three and I replied: “You must be joking!”’

Both Fowler and Schwartzel apologised to Mr Davies for the incidents and each gave him a signed ball.

All three men were thought to have escaped without serious injuries.

The R&A was unable to confirm the extent of their injuries, but said none had been seriously injured and the spectator had only suffered minor injuries.

A spokesman added: 'We take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of spectators at The Open Championship.

'It is relatively rare for spectators or marshals to be struck by golf balls.

'Given the nature of any golf event, we would always recommend caution when in the vicinity of play.'
