An underwater graveyard filled with the bones of extinct giant lemurs up to the size of a gorilla has been discovered in a cave in Madagascar.

Divers found hundreds of fossilised bones and skeletons of the primitive primates as they explored flooded inland caves on the west coast of Madagascar.

The perfectly preserved fossils, which have yet to be properly dated, are thought to be up to 4,000 years old. 

Scientists leading the study of the fossils believe there could be thousands of individuals buried in the soft silt at the bottom of the cave.

This foot long skull of Megaladapis edwardsi is the largest lemur found in the caves in western Madagascar

Among the fossils at the base of the caves was a foot long skull from a species of lemur that weighed as much as 165lbs (75kg) - the same as a female gorilla.

The discovery of the remains of so many giant lemurs, and other extinct species, in one place has left scientists baffled.

It is very unusual to get the bones so many individuals in one place, particularly as most were complete and did not appear to have been disturbed since they had died.

Palaeontologists say the animals could have ended up in the cave in a number of ways:

First they could have been brought there by a predator - in one of the three caves the remains of an extinct carnivore known as the giant fossa. It is thought to have been its den.

However, few of the lemur remains showed signs that they had been gnawed or damaged after death, suggesting they had not been eaten by a predator.

Another theory is that the caves were a sort of graveyard that provided a quiet place for animals to die. It is still unusual to get so many in one place.

Another possibility is that the cave had supported a rich and functioning ecosystem that flooded, killing whatever was inside the cave.

Finally, the bodies of the animals could have been carried into the cave by a flood. 

Palaeontologists say they have also found the remains of another lemur that grew to be as large as a gorilla and weighed hundreds of pounds when fully grown.

Among the fossils, the researchers have also discovered the bones from elephant birds, corned crocodiles, rodents and hippos that roamed the island landscape thousands of years ago.

However, most of the species found in the caves are now extinct and scientists are baffled as to how so many diverse species ended up in one place.

Professor Alfred Rosenberger, an evolutionary primatologist at Brooklyn College in New York, who has been leading the recovery of the fossils, said: 'Nothing like this has ever been found before. It is really an enormous number of fossils all in one place.

'They are very complete, which is unusual in palaeontology. Here everything is together in one place. The preservation is really incredible.'

Speaking to Mail Online he added: 'We know there are hundreds of specimens visible on the surface of the cave floor, and we estimate there are actually thousands. There are fossils in the sediment that will have to be extracted.'

He said it is still unclear how the animals ended up in the cave but they may have been carried there by a flood.

He said: 'That is a major question that only can be addressed with additional research. 

'The common sense hypothesis is that many were accumulated in flooding episodes of some kind. Cyclones are pretty common in Madagascar.

The fossilised giant lemur skulls, like the one above, were found often with complete skeletons in the caves

The caves were found in Tsimanampesotse National Park close to the west coast of the island of Madagascar

'But the questions is actually a complex one, and we will need data from a variety of sources to figure that out.'

A team of specialist cave divers found the fossils as they explored three large flooded inland caves in the Tsimanampesotse National Park called Malaza Mongo, Mitoho and Aven.

In the Aven Cave they discovered huge numbers of lemur fossils while there were also some found in the other caves.

Similar fossils had been found in the past in other nearby caves, but no where near in as many numbers. Those were estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 years old.

This, according to the researchers, suggests that the latest fossils are probably of a similar age.

Professor Rosenberger said that the bones showed hardly any sign of post-death damage like the kind that comes from being eaten by a predator.

Instead, he said it appeared that many of the lemurs had decomposed slowly and their bones have not been disturbed since. 

Scientists have described the apparent graveyard of fossilised giant lemur as a 'remarkable discovery'

The scientists believe there could be hundreds it not thousands of individual animals buried in the silt

Among the other animal fossils found resting on the silt surface were this skull from a horned crocodile

Divers discovered found the fossils sitting on the silt covered floor as they explored three large caves

It has raised intriguing questions about what led all these animals to die in one place.

One theory is that it was a sort of graveyard where the animals went to die, or the cave had once been an ecosystem that flooded, killing whatever was inside the cave.

In Mitoho cave, the researchers found evidence that it had once been the den of an extinct carnivore known as the giant fossa, Cyrptoprocta spelea.

The caves sit within Tsimanampesotse National Park and are thought to have flooded with sea water

Hundreds of fossils were found on top of the cave floor, like above, but many more could be buried in the silt

The scientists believe the graveyard, above, is the largest concentration of giant lemur fossils ever found

This greater bamboo lemur pictured above is one of the most endangered primates in the world, with their population though to number just 500 

They are some of the world’s most-loved animals, but almost 95 per cent of lemurs are threatened with extinction, according to the latest global assessment of at-risk species.

Madagascar is the only place on the planet where they are found in the wild, making them one of the most threatened groups of animals on Earth.

Of the African island nation’s 101 remaining lemur species, more than a fifth are critically endangered, including the largest living lemur, the large-bodied Indri.

Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur and 20 are vulnerable to extinction.

Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food. 

This would explain some of the bones that had appeared there.

The researchers also found fossilised bats, rodents and other carnivores in the caves.

But according to Professor Rosenberger, it is the extent of the lemur fossils that makes the caves truly extraordinary.

They vary in size from those similar to the species found in Madagascar today - the only place in the world where lemurs survive - to the giant Megaladapis edwardsi, which weighed up to 165lbs.

But unlike their primate cousins, these giant lemur were thought to behave more like koala bears, clinging to trees.

Many of the fossilised lemurs discovered in the caves were much larger than species that are alive today 

Few bones, like those above, showed signs of disturbance after death, suggesting the lemurs were not eaten

Professor Rosenberger said they found a skull of one of these creatures in the Malaza Manga cave.

He said: 'One of the nicest things we discovered is a very beautiful skull sitting on the silty surface at the bottom of the cave of an animal called Megaladapis.

'It is a fascinating critter. It is kind of like a koala bear lemur.

'It had a large cow-like skull of about one foot in length, enormous molar teeth - perhaps twice as large as to be expected for body weight - designed to leafy shear food, and a stocky body with fairly short limbs. 

The largest lemur skull found in the caves belonged to a giant lemur called Megaladapis, which is weighed as much as a female gorilla but lived in the trees, clinging to branches much like Koalas do in Australia

'It had no upper incisor teeth, which is an adaptation we find in mammals that crop leaves with flappy big lips.'

The researchers hope that by understanding more about what led to the demise of these species it might help them predict what will happen to the existing ones in the future.

Professor Laurie Godfrey, a palaeontologist at the University of Massachusetts, said: 'When you have a place that two thirds of the animals that lived there only a thousand years ago are gone and replaced by other animals, then what we need to know is what are the implications for the rest of the flora and fauna.'

The lemur remains appear to have decomposed and were undisturbed for hundreds if not thousands of years
