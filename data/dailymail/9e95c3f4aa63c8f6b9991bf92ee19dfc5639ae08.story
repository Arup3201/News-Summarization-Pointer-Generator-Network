A Massachusetts man is lucky to be alive after a practical joke went horribly wrong and he was left clinging to a capsized kayak in freezing cold conditions.

Easthampton firefighters rescued the man from Nashawannuck Pond at about 8 p.m. on Monday.

The man, who hasn't been named, was trying to install a Charlie Brown cutout on a raft that holds a Christmas tree in the middle of the pond when he lost his balance and fell in.

A 3-foot-tall cutout depicting the likeness of cartoon character Charlie Brown was found in his kayak.

'I can see what his intent was, but a practical joke isn't worth losing your life over,' Fire Chief David Mottor told The Daily Hampshire Gazette.

He estimates the water temperature was in the low 40s. 

'It's cold enough to cause hypothermia,' he said.

Police Captain Robert Alberti said that he does not believe the man will be charged with a crime because it does not appear any laws were broken.
