Sasha Bell-Newman, age 13 from Burntisland, a pupil at Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, bullied because she is English

An English-born schoolgirl was left in tears when she became the victim of vicious anti-English abuse in her Scottish secondary school.

Sasha Bell-Newman, 13, was told to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ by a fellow pupil.

According to Sasha’s mother, Teresa, the pupils have recently been taught about the forthcoming independence referendum and had been encouraged to think about a Scottish national anthem.

The distressing incident has sparked fears that internet abuse which has already soured the debate over Scotland’s future is now spreading into everyday life.

Yesterday former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the family’s local MP, contacted Mrs Bell-Newman to offer his sympathies. He also said he would contact the local education authority to discuss what happened.

Sasha was born in Dorset, but the family moved to Scotland when she was just ten months old after falling in love with the country on holiday. She lives with her 44-year-old mother, 40-year-old father Robert Newman, and four-year old brother Ollie in Burntisland on the Firth of Forth.

Mrs Bell-Newman said Sasha, a pupil at Balwearie High in Kirkcaldy, was reduced to tears on Wednesday following the abuse by a fellow classmate. She said: 'My concern is that the situation could possibly get totally out of control if nothing is done now before the referendum vote takes place later in the year.

'The authorities and even the politicians must do something immediately to try and defuse the whole situation before it gets out of hand.'

The full-time mother said Sasha’s class recently heard from a minister who visited the school about what would happen in an independent Scotland, and she said the class was discussing an anthem that would ‘embrace Scottishness’ when the incident happened.

She said: 'One of her classmates turned to Sasha and said he was glad to have her in their team because she had won several Burns poetry competitions.

'He mentioned that she had achieved this without even being Scottish, a comment that was overhead by another pupil who started to shout and swear at her, telling her to ‘f**k off back to your own country’.

'When I contacted the school later they were extremely apologetic and they have been really good in sorting this out.

'But I fear this could be the tip of the iceberg and possibly being experienced by many others because of the passion being whipped up surrounding independence.

'We’re a very British family, but I’m afraid to put a pro-Union sticker in my window.'

Mrs Bell-Newman said her daughter was too upset to go to school yesterday, but may return today.

On Wednesday evening she contacted Gordon Brown’s office, and yesterday received a personal phone call from the former Prime Minister.

Mrs Bell-Newman said: 'He said he was very sorry about what had happened and would contact the education authorities.

'He pointed out that his wife is English and said he hopes that what is happening is by a small minority of Scots.'

Mr Brown has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 General Election, but has made something of a comeback in recent weeks with a series of attacks on Scottish nationalism.

Last night, James More, rector of Balwearie High School, said: 'Any incident which may be motivated by prejudice is dealt with promptly. 

'Discussion has taken place with the parents of both children involved to ensure that no repeat of this behaviour occurs and the matter is resolved in a restorative manner.  As with all schools we deal robustly with incidents which may be motivated by prejudice as they occur, on a case by case basis, in line with Fife Council policy.'

A Fife Council spokesman said all local authority schools have a ‘clear line of impartiality that they adhere to’ ahead of this year’s referendum.
