QUESTION: The past few years have been awful: my husband left me for his PA. 

I felt dowdy and middle-aged, so embarked on a programme of exercise and dieting. 

Even so, I was amazed when a trainer at my gym, who’s 27 (I’m 49), asked me on a date. I want to say ‘Yes’, but I fear it’s undignified and that my body will repel him. What should I do?

ANSWER: I have a friend who swears the best way for any middle-aged woman to make a decision is to ask themselves: ‘What would Madonna do?’

The Queen of pop would never let a trifling thing such as dignity stand between her and a hot young man.

Nor did the director of 50 Shades Of Grey, Sam Taylor-Johnson, put decorum before personal happiness when she wed a much younger actor.

Would it have been more seemly to deny herself an unbelievably handsome husband just to ensure the more censorious members of our society weren’t scandalised?

Of course, this kind of chutzpah is far easier to talk about than achieve. It comes more naturally to celebrities than mere mortals. But that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow a little bit of that erotic entitlement.

This man has gone out of his way to pursue you. It’s also a bit daft, under the circumstances, to be fretful about your body. If he works in your gym, then surely he’s got a good idea of your physique. The simple fact is that he fancies you rotten.

In short, why don’t you do this man a favour and take his request seriously?

If he’s interesting and sexy, you should simply assess him for these qualities. Treat him like any other man who might have the good sense to ask you out.

Please say ‘Yes!’ — perhaps with the addendum: ‘Because I’m worth it!’
