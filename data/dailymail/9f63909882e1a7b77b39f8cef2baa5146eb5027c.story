Historic: President Barack Obama will make a groundbreaking visit to Burma later this month, it has emerged. He is pictured celebrating following his re-election on Tuesday

President Barack Obama will make history by becoming the first U.S. President to visit Burma, it has emerged.

The visit -  which would be one of the first foreign trips following Obama's re-election on Tuesday - will take place on November 18/19, according to an official within the Burmese government.

It will be part of Obama's efforts to encourage democracy in the Southeast Asian nation.

The official, who did not want to be 
named, said Obama would meet with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as 
well as government officials including reformist President Thein Sein.

U.S. officials have not yet announced any plans for a visit, which would come less than two weeks after Obama's election to a second term.

The Burmese official, speaking from the 
capital, Naypyitaw, said today that security for the visit had been 
prepared, but that the schedule was not final.

Obama's administration has sought to encourage the recent democratic progress under Thein Sein by easing sanctions applied against Burma's previous military regime.

Officials in nearby Thailand and Cambodia have already informally announced plans for visits by Obama that same week.

Cambodia is hosting a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and Thailand is a longtime close U.S. ally.

The visit to Burma would be the culmination of a dramatic turnaround in relations with Washington as the country has shifted from five decades of ruinous military rule and shaken off the pariah status it had earned through its bloody suppression of democracy.

Obama's ending of the long-standing U.S. isolation of Burma's generals has played a part in coaxing them into political reforms that have unfolded with surprising speed in the past year.

The U.S. has appointed a full 
ambassador and suspended sanctions to reward Burma for political 
prisoner releases and the election of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi to 
parliament.

From Burma's point of view, the lifting of sanctions is essential for 
boosting a lagging economy that was hurt not only by sanctions that 
curbed exports and foreign investment, but also by what had been a 
protectionist, centralised approach.

Thein Sein's government has initiated major economic reforms in addition to political ones. 

A procession of senior diplomats and world leaders have traveled to Burma, stopping both in the remote, opulent capital city, which was built by the former ruling junta, and at Suu Kyi's dilapidated lakeside villa in the main city of Yangon, where she spent 15 years under house arrest.

New Zealand announced today that Prime Minister John Key would visit Burma after attending the regional meetings in Cambodia.

Significant: The most senior U.S. official to visit Burma was Hillary Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years

The most senior U.S. official to visit was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years.

The Obama administration regards the political changes in Burma as a marquee achievement in its foreign policy, and one that could dilute the influence of China in a country that has a strategic location between South and Southeast Asia, regions of growing economic importance.

But exiled Burmese activists and human rights groups are likely to criticise an Obama visit as premature, rewarding Thein Sein before his political and economic reforms have truly taken root.

The military - still dominant and implicated in rights abuses - has failed to prevent vicious outbreaks of communal violence in the west of the country that have left scores dead.
