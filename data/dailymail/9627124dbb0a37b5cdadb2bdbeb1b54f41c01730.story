Repercussions? In 2005, Barbara Butcher was accused of taking a morbid momento from Ground Zero. She has since been promoted to Chief of Staff at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner

A high ranking official at New York’s medical examiner’s office is accused of taking a piece of the September 11th plane wreckage as a morbid souvenir, but instead of a punishment she’s recently received a promotion.

A witness claims Barbara Butcher, Director of Forensic Investigations at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, ‘excitedly’ took home a recovered piece of a plane’s door.

Former co-worker Kenneth Dotson, alleged in 2005 that Butcher was thrilled as someone from Ground Zero passed off the piece of wreckage to her as she oversaw World Trade Center victim recovery and identification. Now she’s overseeing the entire department.

‘Her eyes lit up,’ Dotson, who was also a medical examiner’s investigator, told the New York Post.

‘She said, “This will make for good conversation on the coffee table,”’ claimed Dotson.

Dotson said he reported the incident in 2005 and was subsequently harassed.

After
 Dotson’s initial allegations, Butcher claimed she took the souvenir 
home ‘for one or two days before returning it,’ according to an official
 report obtained by The Post.

However, the piece has never been recovered.

The report claims Butcher ‘could not recall’ to whom she returned the piece, but ‘conceded it was wrong.’

Also accused: Bronx medical examiner Robert Yee was accused of taking wreckage from a Staten Island Ferry crash that killed 11. Co-workers who turned in Yee and Butcher say they were harassed

‘I would have been fired and prosecuted,’ said Dotson.

Despite her admission, Butcher was has since received a promotion.

As
 Chief Medical Examiner Charles Hirsch retired this year, Butcher was 
promoted to Chief of Staff, which carries a $166,879 salary.

In
 2006, Dotson and co-worker  told the New York Daily News that reporting
 Butcher had won him only harassment. And a fellow investigator at the 
time, Craig Agnard, said he also suffered attacks after reporting that 
Bronx medical examiner investigator Robert Yee had taken another dark 
momento—a piece of the Andrew Barberi Staten Island ferry, which crashed
 in 2003 and killed 11.

‘I
 and the other investigators have paid the price for doing the right 
thing,’ Agnard said at the time, though a spokesperson denied either he 
or Dotson were ever harassed.

Dotson chose to retire in 2007, after 20 years with the department.

A call placed to the Office of the Chief Medical examiner was not immediately returned.
