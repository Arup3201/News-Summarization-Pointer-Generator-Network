A drug-addicted prostitute has been jailed for terrorising elderly residents on the day she was released from prison.

Aisha Delaney, 56, from Hull, was jailed last August for preying on an elderly stroke victim living in a sheltered housing complex.

But Delaney, branded ‘demonic’ by police, breached her Asbo by returning to the complex on the day she was freed to resume her campaign of terror.

Jailing her for seven months, Judge Jeremy Richardson said Delaney’s chaotic existence should act as a warning to young people.

He said: 'If ever there was a case where young people on the threshold of taking drugs and leading a bad life, they should meet that woman and see the sort of wretched life she has led and where she has ended up.

'A not unintelligent woman who has fallen in every sense.'

As Delaney, who has 119 convictions, was led to the cells to return to prison, she said: 'I’m not a bad person.'

Delaney was banned from going within 100m of the complex after committing a string of burglaries and thefts against the residents, all in their 80s and 90s.

Delaney, was given an antisocial behaviour order last January that banned her from causing alarm and distress in an attempt to stop her terrorising the elderly residents in their homes.

However, she has now breached the order for the eighth time, this time returning to the complex just hours after her release from prison on March 28.

Delaney got drunk following her release and claimed she was assaulted, robbed and had paint thrown in her face.

The court heard she had gone to the sheltered housing complex after dark to look for her husband, who still lives there.

Hull City Council’s barrister Kevin Guy said the banning order had been made to protect the elderly people living in fear of her.

He said: 'It was made to protect the vulnerable residents.

'She was seen trying to enter the complex just after 10pm on March 28.

'It was clearly a breach of the order as she is well aware she should not be within 100m of there.'

Her barrister Paul Genney, who agreed to represent Delaney for free after no other lawyer would take the case, said: 'The problem is this lady is married to Mr Delaney, who still lives in this complex and I’m told he has applied to move.

'One doesn’t blame the council as I’m told social housing is hard to obtain but the view is because he has accommodation, he is not a priority to be moved.

'She says she didn’t do anything untoward, she simply approached the building because she says she had been beaten up. It was not a happy homecoming.'

Delaney was jailed for five months after the Asbo was made last year when police caught her in the complex.

She was jailed for 18 months for stealing from an elderly man in the complex last August.

'A not unintelligent woman who has fallen in every sense'

Judge Jeremy Richardson

After this, the eighth breach, Judge Richardson QC warned Delaney he would show her no mercy in the future.

He said: 'Let there be no misunderstanding, it was a simple condition that required simple compliance.

'The residents of this establishment are in fear when you go anywhere near the property, the staff looking after them are in fear and this is why you must stay away.

'If there is any more of this, there will be no mercy. I’m going to reserve any further breaches to myself.

'I will remember your case and if there is any more of this then I’m afraid it is highly likely you will go to prison for a length well in excess of 12 months.

'You have been warned. I have treated you with some mercy, there will be no mercy on a future occasion.'
