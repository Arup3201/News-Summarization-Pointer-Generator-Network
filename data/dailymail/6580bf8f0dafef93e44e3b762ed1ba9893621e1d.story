Case: Kate McCann arrives at Lisbon's civil court today for the start of the family's libel action against Goncalo Amaral

Kate McCann wept in court yesterday as
 friends described her ‘utter despair’ in the days after her daughter 
Madeleine disappeared.

Mrs 
McCann, 45, brushed away tears as her family’s torment was played out on
 the first day of a libel trial against the Portuguese policeman who led
 the botched hunt for Madeleine.

Accusations
 by former detective Goncalo Amaral that Mrs McCann and her husband 
Gerry faked Madeleine’s abduction and then tried to make money from it 
engulfed the couple in a ‘massive tidal wave of lies’, their friends 
told the court.

Mrs McCann 
told friends she was ‘devastated’ by his book, in which he claimed 
Madeleine, then three, died in an accident in her family’s Algarve 
holiday apartment and the couple staged her disappearance to cover up 
their negligence – accusations the McCanns vehemently deny.

The
 couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, launched £1million libel 
proceedings against Mr Amaral, who was sacked as the head of the 
investigation after he launched an outspoken attack on British police.

Their
 friend Susan Hubbard, the wife of an Anglican minister who counselled 
the McCanns after Madeleine’s disappearance from a holiday resort in 
Praia da Luz, said: ‘The thought that most people in Portugal thought 
Madeleine was dead was devastating for both Kate and Gerry – and the 
thought that was added, that they had something to do with it.’

Mrs
 McCann, a GP, cried as the court heard she was unable to eat and 
constantly wept in the days after Madeleine’s disappearance on May 3, 
2007.

But Mrs Hubbard, 46, said Mrs McCann’s despair turned to ‘anger 
and surprise’ after the couple were named as arguidos – or suspects – by
 the Portuguese police.

Mr 
Amaral’s book, The Truth Of The Lie, was published three days after the 
Portuguese authorities formally closed the investigation in 2008 and 
cleared the couple as suspects.

The McCanns’ lawyer, Isabel Duarte, said
 it also contained claims that the family’s ‘Find Madeleine’ fund could 
be fraudulent.

The fund 
raised £2million in public donations and was used to pay for the search 
for Madeleine to continue after the Portuguese case was closed.

A 
private detective who worked for the fund said he received abuse instead
 of information after Mr Amaral’s book soured public opinion against the
 McCanns.

Another friend, 
documentary-maker Emma Loach, the daughter of film director Ken Loach, 
said the book contained a ‘massive tidal wave of lies’.

She
 added: ‘If people believe Madeleine is dead they won’t look for her, 
and if people believe Kate and Gerry were involved they won’t help them.

‘Imagine
 the public believing that you covered up your child’s death and then 
sought to make money out of it. They feel shame, humiliation and 
anguish.’

Mr Amaral’s book sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the McCanns won an injunction against him.

Mrs
 McCann attended the hearing at Lisbon’s civil court alone as her 
husband, a heart surgeon, remained in Britain to work and look after 
Madeleine’s brother and sister, eight-year-old twins Sean and Amelie.

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs McCann said: ‘I am here today for Madeleine and, I strongly hope, for justice.

‘I’m
 here to stop the damage that has been caused and is still being caused 
in the search for our daughter, and to stop the suffering that has been 
caused to our family by the theories of Goncalo Amaral.’

The case continues.
