Closing call: Fabian Hamilton, MP for Leeds North East, wants to end the arms industry

A Labour MP has called for the abolition of the British arms industry.

Fabian Hamilton said he does not approve of selling weapons abroad and would like to see the multi- billion-pound sector closed down.

The outburst provoked ridicule last night, not least because defence manufacturers supply much of the kit used by the British Armed Forces as well as employing about 300,000 people across the country.

Mr Hamilton made his comments during a phone-in programme on BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday.

The MP for Leeds North East told listeners: ‘I frankly think we have no business exporting weapons.’

Programme host Nicky Campbell then asked Mr Hamilton: ‘Would you like to phase it out and close it down?’

Mr Hamilton replied: ‘I think I would like to.’

The UK has the second-most lucrative defence industry in the world, after the United States, with exports worth £11.4billion last year.

It is calculated that one tenth of all British manufacturing is in the defence sector, with more than 9,000 companies.

Tory MP Jack Lopresti said: ‘Labour left us with terrible unemployment; now they want to send another 300,000 Brits to the dole queues.

‘If [Labour leader] Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up for British defence and manufacturing, then he’s too weak to run the country.’

Last night, Labour sought to distance itself from Mr Hamilton’s suggestion. A spokesman said: ‘This is not Labour Party policy.

'We are committed to a strong defence industry which serves our Armed Forces with world-class kit as well as providing high-skilled jobs for thousands.

‘The defence industry is absolutely vital and uniquely placed to both protect and promote our country.’
