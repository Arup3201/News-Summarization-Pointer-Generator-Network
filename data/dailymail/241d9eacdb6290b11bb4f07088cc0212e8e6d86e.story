An alleged stalker bombarded Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman with more than 100,000 Twitter messages and kissed her after following her to the ITN building, a court heard today.

Adrian Johnson, 54, allegedly sent the journalist flowers and greeting cards and frequently turned up at Channel 4 News’s central London headquarters.

He also terrorised Ms Newman, who has been married to writer John O'Connell since 2001, with scores of emails and text messages after finding out her mobile number, it is claimed.

Mr Johnson then took to Twitter to harass the broadcaster with over 100,000 tweets - most sent directly to the former Financial Times reporter, Highbury Corner Magistrates’ heard.

Ms Newman, who has previously worked for the Independent and the Washington Post, has since blocked Johnson from her Twitter account.

Johnson, with peroxide blonde hair and wearing prescription sunglasses in the dock, spoke only to confirm his name and deny a charge of harassment without violence.

Holding a cane and wearing an electric blue jumper, Johnson showed no emotion as he was told he will face trial at the same court in October.

‘The main part of the evidence is from Mr Johnson’s computer - evidence from his Twitter account is in excess of over 100,000 tweets’, Rebecca Cooke, defending, said.

‘He disputes his course of conduct amounted to harassment.

‘The complainant is a Channel 4 News reader who has Twitter and regularly tweets. She has sent emails to the defendant and has also responded to messages on Twitter.

‘The defendant never received a warning of harassment but he has since been blocked from the complainant’s Twitter account’.

Ms Newman, 39, will be giving evidence at the two-day trial, which has been provisionally set for October 1.

Prosecutor Penny Ferguson said that the Crown would be relying on evidence seized from Johnson’s computer.

Johnson was granted bail on condition that he does not contact Ms Newman or go within 50 metres of her, and that he does not attend the ITN building.
