England will name Fijian-born soldier Semesa Rokoduguni in their Elite Player Squad on Wednesday, leaving Chris Ashton’s World Cup dream hanging by a thread.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster will unveil his core 33-man squad ahead of the four-Test QBE Series with Bath’s uncapped 27-year-old set to be included at Ashton’s expense as England search for some attacking X-factor ahead of next year’s global tournament.

On Tuesday night it was understood Ashton - capped 39 times and England’s starting No 14 at the 2011 World Cup - will not be one of four wings in Lancaster’s squad, with Rokoduguni set to be named alongside Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell and Jonny May.

In-form Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani is another high-profile absentee, with Lancaster expected to name Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler as his No 10s, while Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees is also expected to be omitted, barring an 11th-hour reprieve.

Sportsmail also understands Northampton flanker Calum Clark - banned for 32 weeks in 2012 for breaking Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins’ arm - will be named along with fit-again Saracens centre Brad Barritt and Bath centre Jonathan Joseph, who replaces the injured Manu Tuilagi, ruled out on Tuesday with a groin problem.

There is still a chance Ashton could be called up as one of seven additions to the training squad on Sunday, but the Saracens player has clearly dropped down the pecking order. Leicester’s uncapped lock Graham Kitchener is the favourite to replace concussion victim Geoff Parling.

Rokoduguni’s inclusion will complete an extraordinary transition for the Afghanistan war veteran, who only signed professional papers with Bath in 2012 after director of rugby Mike Ford spotted him playing for the Army in a friendly against Newcastle and brought him to the Recreation Ground on trial.

‘It has been my target to play international rugby with England,’ Rokoduguni said on Tuesday. ‘I’m confident with the way I’m playing. I feel ready for the step up. Back in my village I played rugby but I wasn’t the first-choice winger. I trained hard every single day and still didn’t get picked.’

Rokoduguni, who is a serving soldier with the Scots Dragoon Guards and lives in military accommodation in Warminster, sends a significant chunk of his salary back to his family in Fiji, where he was born and raised.

‘The Army came to Fiji with the intention of getting guys to join up,’ he said. ‘I came over in 2007.

‘I am full-time rugby at the moment but if the Army wanted to deploy me in Iraq or Afghanistan then the Army comes first.’

Rokoduguni, who featured for the Saxons last season, has been the form wing in the Aviva Premiership with six tries in seven matches. His inclusion in the full England squad is a clear indicator of attacking intent.

Ford said: ‘Can he handle it? I don’t know. The key is not to try to change him. He is a free-style, free spirit rugby player and that is what makes him exciting.’

Rokoduguni’s Bath team-mate Joseph, first capped two years ago against South Africa, is another player set to bring some attacking verve to England’s three-quarter play after convincing Lancaster he has improved his breakdown work to complement his undoubted qualities with ball in hand.

‘JJ’s been outstanding,’ Ford said. ‘You could tell in pre-season he had the bit between his teeth. Before he came here I’d only seen him play at England Under 20s and I thought he was a bit soft. But you meet the kid and he’s not.’

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill on Tuesday confirmed Tuilagi’s groin injury will see him miss the autumn series, which begins against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8.

Bath say Kyle Eastmond’s rib injury is not as serious as first feared.
