The BBC has admitted programmes aired before the 9pm watershed are not always suitable for children.

Under the corporation’s guidelines, programmes containing adult material such as nudity, swearing and violence should not be shown before this boundary.

But the corporation’s governing body has now confessed, for what appears to be the first time, that not all programming shown an hour before the watershed is suitable for younger children - prompting experts to warn that this could signal the end of the 9pm threshold.

Claim: Viewers of the popular soap Holby City, on at 8pm, 'would not have found the swearing unacceptable'

The unexpected and damning admission was made by the BBC Trust following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long-running and popular soap Holby City which is aired at 8pm.

Rejecting the complaint that it was inappropriate for such language to be used before the watershed, the trust’s Editorial Standards Committee said in a report released yesterday that ‘regular viewers of this drama serial would not have found the use of the word ‘s***ging’ or the phrase ‘cut his b**** off’ unacceptable.’

It added: ‘Holby City starts an hour before the watershed, when viewers are aware that not all programming is suitable for younger children.

‘Parents and carers share responsibility with the broadcaster to decide what is suitable for children to view.’

The decision was made despite the BBC’s own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children.

Responding to the decision, Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Media Watch, described the revelation as ‘shocking’ and ‘incredible’, while Miranda Suit, co-chair of charity Safermedia, warned that continual breaches of the watershed in this way would lead to a ‘public outcry’.

Miss Pattison, 44, said the BBC Trust’s decision not to uphold the complaint meant parents could no longer trust that their children are safe from explicit material.

The mother-of-two said: '’I’m really shocked that they have done this. According to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning, what is it?

'Eight o’clock? Half past seven? Is that the beginning of the transition?’

Holby City, a BAFTA award-winning medical drama, is broadcast weekly on BBC 1 at 8pm. Offence was caused to a viewer during an episode aired in September last year which was watched by 4.66 million people, including about 186,000 children.

During the programme a registrar says to a nurse: ‘You’re just s***ging her [referring to a consultant]. Actually forming a functioning relationship with a woman is like picking through a minefield.’  

Later in the episode the consultant advises the registrar to ‘remind him that you have the power to cut his b**** off’ after a radiologist delays a patient’s X-Ray.  

The complainant, who has not been named, took offence to ‘such appallingly sexually explicit language’ and he contacted the BBC querying whether the language used in the programme would have been acceptable if it had been used by a schoolteacher.

He stated: ‘I contend that parents and carers do not have dual standards and they expect high standards from their schools and their BBC.’

The Trust admitted there was ‘some sensitivity’ to the use of the word ‘s**g’ in pre-watershed viewing and referred to previous complaints from viewers.

It also noted that some viewers may find the use of these particular words ‘offensive’ but said the language was fitting given the context of the scene and the ‘animosity’ between the two characters on the show.

However, the Trust, which acts as the final arbiter of appeals within the corporation, concluded the programme had not breached guidelines.

'There are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children'

Miss Pattison argued parents used the watershed as a guide to know what is and is not suitable for their children to watch.

She said: ‘I’ve never seen Holby City but does that mean I cannot expect that my first time of watching it to be suitable for pre-watershed broadcast? It must be because it’s broadcast before nine o’clock.’

Mrs Suit, 59, whose charity is working to protect children from media harm, added: ‘There are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children.

'But if we’re going to see broadcasters themselves undermining that protection then I think we’ll have a real outcry.’

The complaint is not the first time that questions have been raised over the BBC and swearing. In 2009 viewers told a TV standards investigation that they were fed up with bad language.

Under the new regime suggested, ironically, by the BBC Trust, the most offensive words will almost always be bleeped out or cut for another hour after the 9pm watershed on BBC 1.
