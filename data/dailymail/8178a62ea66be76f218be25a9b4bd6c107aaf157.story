A British man has admitted attempting to smuggle $30million (£80million) of cocaine into Europe from the Caribbean.

Rawson Watson, from Kent, faces 10 years in an American jail after he was caught boarding a Belgium-bound plane in the Dominican Republic with a tonne of cocaine in December 2011.

The drug was found spread across 20 suitcases in 1,001 separate packages, according to reports.

Guilty plea: Rawson Watson has admitted attempting to smuggle $30million of cocaine into Europe from the Caribbean

Watson faces charges along with alleged 
Dutch accomplice Nicolas Epskamp and Nayef Fawaz, who is said to have 
chartered the plane to transport the haul of drugs.

Fawaz was arrested separately in Panama in June last year.

Watson's guilty plea was welcomed by U.S attorney for Manhattan Preet Bharara, according to the Telegraph.

He said: 'Today's guilty plea ensures that Rawson Edward Watson will be punished for his role in attempting to further the international drug trade U.S aircraft.'

Watson will be sentenced in January and faces at least 10 years in prison, but could face a heftier sentence.

He will also be fined between $20,000 (£12,350) and $10million (£6.18million).

Haul: Watson was attempting to smuggle drugs from the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic

The 48-year-old was jailed in 2003 after he was found guilty of trying to steal £1.5million worth of Spanish pesetas.

His plan to stow away in the hold of a plane hidden in a wooden box was thwarted three years earlier, when baggage handlers dropped the box causing him to fall out onto the tarmac.

He managed to flee Heathrow Airport and went on the run for three years, finally getting arrested when police took a DNA sample after he was stopped for drink driving.
