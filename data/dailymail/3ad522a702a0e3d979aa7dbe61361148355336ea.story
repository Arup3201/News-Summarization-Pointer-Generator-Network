Climbdown: Fawcett Society's Belinda Phipps has now said the workers' conditions are in 'complete contradiction' to their ethical policy

The Fawcett Society has for the first time conceded it is ‘very concerned’ that women in Mauritius making its ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirts are paid just 62p an hour.

The Left-wing feminist organisation has for weeks rejected accusations of an ethical blunder after The Mail on Sunday revealed the conditions under which the workers are employed. But the Society has now sent an inquiry team to the island to investigate.

Fawcett chairwoman Belinda Phipps made the climbdown yesterday, saying: ‘Obviously we’re very concerned about what’s been brought to our attention. It’s in complete contradiction to our own ethical policy.’

Ms Phipps said that clothing retailer Whistles, which sold the £45 T-shirts – worn by Labour’s Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband, and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – was conducting the investigation with Made-By, a charity dedicated to ethical standards in fashion.

‘Whistles are concerned and the government of Mauritius is concerned. What matters to us now is that there is a full and thorough investigation. Whistles are in Mauritius. We expect to have a report from them in about two weeks.’

But the news came after the charity was again accused of ‘shameless hypocrisy’ over its new campaign for a ‘living wage’ in the UK, despite the fact the migrant workers in Mauritius are paid far below the official ‘living wage’ there, and were living 16 to a room in dormitories. 

Yet When The Mail on Sunday asked the Society whether it supported the living wage in Mauritius – which would represent a significant pay rise for workers producing their T-shirts at the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile (CMT) factory – we received no comment.

The official Mauritian living wage is £1.47 an hour, though the workers making the T-shirts do receive free board and lodging, however basic.

Whistles and the Fawcett Society chose to ignore the living wage – an official Mauritius government benchmark of a basic salary in the country – and instead pointed out the women were being paid above the minimum wage, a figure even the government accepted needs to be reviewed.

In a press release last week, the Fawcett Society gave its full backing to the concept of a living wage, at least in the UK.

Commenting on figures showing the disparity between wages paid to men and women had closed only a little in the past year, it said more needed to be done to reduce the gender pay gap, and called on the Government to sign up to the living wage in this country by paying it to civil servants and encouraging local authorities to do the same. 

Fawcett’s deputy chief executive Dr Eva Neitzert said: ‘We urgently need to tackle the unacceptably low wages paid to women.

‘Government should take the lead in supporting the take-up of the living wage.’ Jane Ragoo, a Mauritius union leader, last night condemned the Society over its UK living wage comments, saying: ‘It seems to think it is OK to exploit workers in Mauritius, but not in the UK. It is guilty of shameful hypocrisy.’
