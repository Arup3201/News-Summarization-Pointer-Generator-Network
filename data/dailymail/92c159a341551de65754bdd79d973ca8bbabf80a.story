New emails released early Friday in the Sony hack reveal a shocking incident of nepotism between Sony Chair Amy Pascal, her husband and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.

In a column Dowd was writing about women in Hollywood shortly after the 2014 Academy Awards, citing the box office success of female-fronted films such as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Gravity, Frozen and The Heat, she asked to interview Pascal, the only female head of a major studio.

Pascal however is shown to be hesitant in emails exchanged between herself and husband Bernie Weinraub, until Weinraub reveals that he will be seeing the column before it is published and Dowd assures Pascal she will look 'great' in the article.

The end result is a Times piece that makes Pascal look incredible, a woman who has had huge Hollywood hits but also worked to change the film industry's sexist attitudes as the Sony exec goes so far as to call out the 'paltry' amount of money women in the business get - this despite the fact that at $3million a year she is the highest paid employee at Sony.

Spousal perk: Amy Pascal (left) was promised she would look 'great' in a New York Times column that her husband Bernie Wenraub (left) was able to see before publication

Nepotism: The column's writer, Maureen Dowd (above), previously worked with Weinraub when he was at the Times

This perk no doubt came as a result of the fact that Weinraub spent over a decade working for the Times as the paper's Hollywood correspondent, leaving in 2005, about a year before his wife would be named to her current post.

The emails, obtained by Buzzfeed, show that Dowd emailed Pascal on March 3 for comment on the column, saying; 'i would make sure you look great and we’d check it all and do it properly.'

Pascal then contacts her husband before speaking to Dowd, who reveals he is aware the columnist had reached out as he had already spoken to her.

'I said the rap that you jus like to make womens films is unfair amnd sexist,' says Weinraub.

'You made all these “women’s movies ===league of their own, 28 days,,,the nora Ephron films…zero dark…. but you also do spifderman… denzel….Jonah hill…..bad teacher etc etc.' 

He then tells his wife that he already knows the column will be based around a quote Cate Blanchett gave when accepting her Academy Award for Best Actress in Blue Jasmine, though he misidentifies her as 'Cate Winslett.'

Tense meeting: On Wednesday, Dowd came face-to-face with Angelina Jolie (above), a day after emails leaked in which she attacked the star's planned remake of Cleopatra

Pascal responds just two minutes later, writing; 'IM NOT TALKING TO HER IF SHE IS GONNA SLAM ME. PLEASE FIND OUT.'

It is at that point that Weinraub tells his wife; 'you cant tell single person that I’m seeing the column before its printed…its not done…no p.r. people or Lynton or anyone should know.'

'Lynton' is Michael Lynton, the co-chair of Sony Entertainment.

'When Pascal greenlit Nora Ephron and Nancy Meyers rom-coms, some male executives sniffed “So what’s next?”' Dowd writes in her column.

'Adam Sandler, Will Smith, the Spider-Man franchise, The Social Network, and this year’s American Hustle and Captain Phillips impressed the guys in the boardroom.'

Just 10 minutes after the column was published, Charles Sipkins, then the head of communications at Sony, forwarded it to Pascal and Lynton, remarking on how 'impressive' it was.

Dowd and Pascal also exchanged loving emails after the column appeared online, with Pascal calling Dowd her 'favorite person' and Dowd telling Pascal, 'you’re mine! you’re amazing.' 

Weinraub, when reached for comment, told a reporter; 'I have no idea what you’re talking about.'

Dowd meanwhile says she never promised Weinraub a look at her column.

'I never showed Bernie the column in advance or promised to show it. Bernie is an old friend and the Times’ former Hollywood reporter, and he sometimes gives me ideas for entertainment columns,' she said in a statement to The Wrap. 

'In January, he suggested a column, inspired by a study cited in the L.A. Times, about the state of women in Hollywood. Amy is a friend and I reassured her before our interview that it wasn't an antagonistic piece. She wasn't the focus of the story, nor was Sony.'

She then added; 'I emailed with Bernie and talked to him before I wrote the column in March, getting his perspective on the Hollywood old boys’ club and the progress of women. But I didn't send him the column beforehand.' 

Bad combo: On Thursday, racist emails about President Barack Obama between Pascal and producer Scott Rudin (above) were leaked

Calling them out: Actor Kevin Hart (right) has called out Pascal (center) and Sony producer Clint Culpepper (left) over their 'ignorant' comments 

This email exchange is just the latest released in the Sony hack, as Pascal continues to be hit harder than anyone else involved in the incident, carried out by a group called Guardians of Peace.

Pascal apologized for her language in some of the emails Thursday, this after a racist exchange she and producer Scott Rudin had about President Barack Obama went public.

'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,' said Pascal.

'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'

Pascal also came face-to-face with Angelina Jolie on Wednesday after a heated exchange between her and Rudin was leaked by Gawker in which they admonished the star for having an 'rampaging spoiled ego' over her planned Cleopatra remake, which Sony was working on.

In a photo from the event Jolie appears to be giving Pascal a remarkably icy stare as the seemingly frazzled Pascal frantically grips the actress' arms. 

On Thursday Pascal sat down for her first interview following the hack, explaining to The Wrap where she goes from here. 

'I have a studio to run. We are putting movies out. Everyone here is working,' she said. 

'I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. It's business as usual here.'

She then states that she does not believe this hack has damaged her to the point where she can no longer be an effective executive.

Pascal, who grew up in Los Angeles, began her career as a secretary at Sony, working her way up to the top post over the course of 20 years. 

Industry site Deadline is saying however that these leaked emails may mean the end for Pascal at the studio.
