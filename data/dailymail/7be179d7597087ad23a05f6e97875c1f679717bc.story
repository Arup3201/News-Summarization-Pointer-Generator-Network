With two double bedrooms, a large garden and planning permission for an extension, you might think £320,000 would be a bargain for a 'quaint' Surrey cottage.

However, this house in Addlestone gives more the impression of long term project than family home, complete with rusty cars and a caravan hidden somewhere in its jungle of a back yard.

Despite this, in the increasingly competitive housing market, its enterprising owner was able to bump up the asking price from the original £299,950 and still attract an offer good enough for them to have stopped further viewings.

The garden of the property has become completely overgrown and is strewn with abandoned vehicles

An online advert for the property, which has drummed up an offer, despite its poorly maintained state

In their online advert, property agents Townends say potential buyers have 'a rare and unique opportunity to purchase this quaint cottage set within the ever popular Poets Corner development'.

The estate agents, who have been listing the property since October 2013, admit that it requires 'heavy refurbishment' but insist it is a 'real blank canvas' for people who want to put 'their own stamp on a property'.

The home is also being advertised by agents Gascoigne-Pees, who uploaded their advert on March 1.

This advert mentions that the house has planning permission for an extension - however, it is not known whether this is in fact the case.

The sole photo of the inside of the property can, at best, be described as austere, with bare white walls and floor boards covered with worn-looking rugs. However, it does offer a glimpse of what appears to be an original Victorian fireplace.

The property is described be estate agents as a 'blank canvas' and an 'opportunity' for potential buyers

Weeds have taken over the garden but the house is on a large plot that may have permission for an extension

The internal photograph of the house paints an austere picture. Agents accept it needs 'modernisation'

Gascoigne-Pees, whose advert this internal photo is attached to, warn potential viewers that the property is in 'need of modernisation throughout'.

The garden is the most striking part of this property.

Most prospective sellers spend thousands doing up their homes, hoping to claim the money back by being able to charge more for a spick and span property.

However, the owners of this cottage have let weeds run rampant in the garden and the plants seem to have claimed a VW Beetle and several motorhomes - seemingly abandoned outside - as their own.

The owners have been trying to sell the property since, at least, October and have now received an offer

The property originally went on the market for £299,950 but the asking price was bumped up to £320,000

Alex Gosling, managing director of online estate agents Housesimple.co.uk, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I do find it amazing that the agents don't politely suggest that the vendor spends a weekend clearing that lot up.'

While it is unknown how much the owner has been offered for the cottage, the average selling price for similar, nearby properties is £305,000.

Both Gascoigne-Pees and Townends were unavailable for comment last night.
