The new England rugby kit was embroiled in more controversy yesterday over claims officials had decided to downplay its Victoria Cross design.

The VC – the highest award for gallantry a member of the British or Commonwealth Armed Forces can receive – had been used for ‘inspiration’ on the new jerseys.

A pattern of the medal’s shape is on the ‘ball deadening’ rubber grips on both the home white and red change strips.

However The Times claimed that previous press releases had mentioned the medal design only for it to be omitted altogether at the last minute from Monday’s launch.

It alleged that both the shirt manufacturers Canterbury and the Rugby Football Union had a last minute change of heart over the appropriateness.

Some fears that it was crass to associate bravery in the rugby world with the VC that is awarded for ‘most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice’.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster has drawn heavily on England’s rich rugby history and used previous military examples to inspire players.

The former Leeds boss created the Arthur Harrison Award, where England coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance.

Harrison is England’s only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Belgian Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War.

It is the latest embarrassment for the RFU, which was forced to defend its new kit after admitting it will be changed in 10 months in time for the sport’s world cup.

The latest replica shirts, which cost £91, will be used by the national team in the forthcoming Autumn internationals and next year’s Six Nations tournament.

But Rugby Football Union sources yesterday confirmed that another shirt would go on sale next July in time for the Rugby World Cup, which is being held in England.

Under the tournament’s rules, all teams must remove sponsorship logos and attach a Rugby World Cup 2015 badge while taking part. Every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by September.

It means the England rugby team will only wear the Test shirt for around 12 matches before switching again.

The manufacturers brought out three other Pro and Classic official jerseys at £56 each that are also replicas, but not made to the same standards as the Test strips the players wear.

The new shirt’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last September, apart from moving the English Rose badge from the left to the centre.

Suppliers Canterbury claim the Test jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres, has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small loop collar. It also has a ‘ball deadening’ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball.

However, some English and Welsh fans have questioned the all red change strip – colours usually worn by Wales. The row has heightened after both England and Wales will play each other in next year’s tournament along with Australia in what has been dubbed the Group of Death.

The RFU and Canterbury said in a joint statement: ‘We are extremely pleased with our new kits and have worked in close collaboration during the design process. We had three key focus areas this season: the rose, which for the first time ever has moved to the centre of the shirt; the red colour for the alternate kit and the fact that the team would wear this against Samoa.

‘In addition the grip detail takes inspiration from the Victoria Cross and this is something that England Rugby and Canterbury are proud of.’
