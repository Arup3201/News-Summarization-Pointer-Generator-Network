One of the major financial backers of President Barrack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign has been indicted in an alleged multi-million dollar insurance swindle.

Kareem Ahmed, the president and CEO of Ontario firm Landmark Medical Management, is accused of masterminding the scheme and is facing charged of conspiracy, insurance fraud and involuntary manslaughter, according to TPM.

Ahmed and 15 of his associates - most of them doctors and one pharmacist - were indicted by a California grand jury, TPM reported.

He is accused of developing topical cream formulas 'based on the profitability of the ingredients' and bribing doctors who treated workers' compensation patients to prescribe them.

Kareem Ahmed, who gave $1 million to the Obama re-election campaign in 2012, has been indicted by Orange Country grand jury for leading a major insurance kickback scheme through his company, Landmark Medical Management

Ahmed paid physicians a total of more than $25 million to dispense the compound creams, according to KPCC.

The alleged operation is said to have gone on from June 15, 2010, to December 31, 2012.

It also involved filing false insurance claims with different insurance companies.

The amounts individual doctors received between 2010 and 2013 ranged from $600,000 to more than $2.5 million

Among those Ahmed paid were Daniel Capen, M.D. (more than $2.5 million); Andrew Jarminski, M.D. (more than $1.9 million); pharmacist Michael Rudolph (more than $1 million); and Rahil Kahn, M.D. (more than $1 million), according to the indictment.

However mystery surrounds the circumstances of the involuntary manslaughter charge.

The incident alleged that on or about Feb. 3, 2012, Ahmed, Rudolph and Jarminski 'did unlawfully and without malice kill Andrew G. (a minor) ... in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner and without due caution and circumspection'.

The indictment had no other details.

Ahmed has denied the charges through a spokesperson.

The human resources for his company, Landmark Medical Management, Ladonna Hieber said in a statement to TPM that Ahmed and his staff 'are innocent of all charges that have been alleged'.

'The charges are meritless and we expect full exoneration of any wrongdoing,' Hieber said in the statement.

Ahmed gave $1 million to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action in 2012.

Additionally, data maintained by The Center for 
Responsive Politics showed that Ahmed gave tens of thousands of additional
 dollars to Democrats in 2013.

The practices of his medical firm have been under suspicion for years in California.

In a 2012 interview with TPM, Ahmed said he was trying to protect his business by remaining private.

'My problem is, I don't want competition,' he said at the time.

'I like to have a private life. I don't want people to copy my business model, which I have wasted millions on, with legal opinion letters, from whatever, perfecting it over years.

'I don't want people to take it for free, and start giving me competition.'

In early October, the Orange County District Attorney's Office raided the offices of Landmark Medical Management.
