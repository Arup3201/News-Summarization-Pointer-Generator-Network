Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell wrote of his disgust that anyone could reveal the Royal family's 'most personal secrets' 20 years before he did the same himself.

Letters he wrote to a friend when he served as the Queen's footman in 1982 show his reaction to the publishing of the memoirs of Prince Charles' former valet Stephen Barry.

Burrell, who has since published a tell-all book about his time at Buckingham Palace, wrote: 'I think it is disgusting - someone revealing the most personal secrets of the Royal Family.

'They must be cautious when chatting to staff from now on - after all, they must wonder 'who can one trust?'.'

Burrell has been accused of cashing-in on his time in the Royal Household and betraying the confidence of Princess Diana since publishing his memoirs in 2003.

His book, A Royal Duty, was said to have been highly damaging and included allegations of an affair between Prince Charles and nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Burrell spent 10 years as the Queen's footman at Buckingham Palace before working as Diana's butler for another 10 years up until her death in 1997.

His 30 letters, that are now to be sold at auction, also include sweet anecdotes of the Queen playing the role of a doting grandmother to Zara Phillips when she was a baby.

As a 15-month-old, Zara wore her best party dresses when having breakfast and afternoon tea with the Queen during a stay at Balmoral Castle in August 1982.

The Queen was said to have been 'thrilled' with her granddaughter and made a point of saying goodnight to her at 6.30pm.

The letters also tell how Zara's elder brother Peter, then aged four, wheeled her around the Scottish castle in a toy car.

When Burrell said to their mum that Zara looked quite happy, Princess Anne quipped: "Well at least she is now, until he tips over."

On another occasion at Balmoral, the Queen raised concerns about the health of one of her corgi dogs.

Her late sister Margaret puffed on a cigarette and replied: 'Well, perhaps he'll pop orf in the night!'

All the letters, dated from June to December 1982, were sent to Burrell's friend Michael Hillard.

They were found in a routine clearance of Mr Hillard's home in Bournemouth, Dorset, following his recent death and are now being sold.

They are expected to sell for a total of about Â£500.

Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions which is holding the auction, said: 'There are some interesting comments in these letters from Paul Burrell.

'His views on giving away Royal Family secrets certainly raise an eyebrow when you look at what he did years later in publishing a couple of books about his involvement with Princess Diana and the Royal Family.

'But other parts of these letters do give a fascinating insight into the hum-drum life in the Royal Household.'

Burrell, now aged 52, also wrote of how the Royal Family enjoyed barbecues at Balmoral - even when it was cold and wet.

He wrote: 'Margot screeched at the suggestion and Diana groaned, Sarah pulled a face but everyone seemed quite happy.

'"Wish I was tucked up in bed with our one and only" Diana said before leaving.'

The auction takes place tomorrow at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel at Heathrow, west London.
