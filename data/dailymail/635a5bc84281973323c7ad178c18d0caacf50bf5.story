Goodbye: McAfee looks forlorn just before he drives off to the airport on his way to Miami, Florida

Software pioneer and former fugitive John McAfee will call the U.S. his home after his arrest in Guatemala and a month on the lam after the murder of a fellow American in Belize.

McAfee, who made millions though the antivirus software that bears his name will be deported from Guatemala, where he was arrested for illegal entry last week.

He turned up in Guatemala after evading officials in Belize for about a month.

McAfee's lawyers managed to block an attempt to deport him back to Belize.

'Complying
with migration law, Mr. John McAfee is to be deported to his country of
origin,' said Fernando Lucero, a spokesman for Guatemala's immigration 
office.

Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said even with McAfee in the U.S., they still want to question him.

'He
will be just under the good will of the United States of America. He is
still is a person of interest, but a U.S. national has been killed and 
he has been somewhat implicated in that murder.

People want him to answer some questions,' he said.

'We have good relations with the United States of America and I am sure that we will get to the bottom of it.'

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said today: ' We are working to confirm reports that he’s been ordered released by a judge in Guatemala.  Obviously, the Guatemalans will have more to say on this.  We, meanwhile, from our Embassy in Guatemala, continue to provide all appropriate consular services to him.  This includes regular visits to check on his welfare and monitoring his case in the Guatemalan courts.

Love lost: McAfee's 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Vanegas did not make the trip to the U.S. with him

Tearful goodbye: McAfee left Guatemala on Wednesday, and left an emotional Vanegas behind

Guatemala has been 
holding McAfee, 67, since he was arrested last Wednesday after arriving 
in the country with his 20-year-old Belizean girlfriend, Samantha Vanegas.

But as McAfee is deported, it's apparently the end of the line for Vanegas, who was left in Guatemala.

She was pictured outside the La Aurora Airport with tears in her eyes after seeing McAfee off.

McAfee said he would be heading to sunny Florida today.

'I'll be leaving at 3:30pm to Miami,' he told Reuters by telephone, after which he left for the airport.

He added: 'That was the only option I
had. I can't take a flight that stops in any other country and there 
are only two flights going to America today.'

McAfee is wanted for questioning in the killing of American Gregory Faull, his neighbor on the Caribbean island 
of Ambergris Caye.

The two had quarreled at times, including over McAfee's unruly dogs. Authorities in Belize say he is not a prime suspect in the investigation.

The eccentric tech pioneer, who made his fortune from his anti-virus software, has been chronicling life on the run in a blog, www.whoismcafee.com.

McAfee claims Belize authorities will kill him if he turns himself in for questioning.

He has denied any role in Faull's 
killing and said he is being persecuted by Belize's ruling party for 
refusing to pay some $2million in bribes.

Belize's prime minister has rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.'
