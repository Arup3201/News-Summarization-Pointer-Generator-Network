Previously unseen photographs revealing the extent of the neglect suffered by a baby orangutan before his rescue have been released as donations to pay for his care hit £50,000.

Little Budi was caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life but is now on the road to recovery thanks to a British animal welfare charity.

New video footage and photographs taken at a rescue centre in Borneo reveal the staggering improvement in his health - from a 10-month-old ape too weak to move, to sitting up and eating from a spoon.

Rescue: Budi the orangutan was found lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up

Tragic: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort

Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo

Before Budi was rescued, his owner hadn't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him.

Her ignorance and neglect were killing him slowly and painfully, but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand him over.

He was rescued in Indonesia by International Animal Rescue  and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home in Borneo.

His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent.

But the future is now looking bright for Budi thanks to the people caring for him at the rescue centre and MailOnline readers who have helped raised £50,000 in a few short weeks.

A new video shows him eating pureed food from a spoon, which vet Christine Nelson describes as 'remarkable'.

'When Budi first arrived he didn’t even have the muscle strength to open his own mouth,' she said.

'The vets would have to press the sides of his mouth gently so it would open wide enough for them to get the food into him.'

Slurp! When Budi was found, he was too weak to open his mouth to eat, but he now eagerly licks pureed food from a spoon

Rest: After such an ordeal, Budi is making the most of having a comfortable pillow to get some well-deserved sleep

He is still not able to eat solid food because he hasn't learned how to chew, but can sit up on his own - quite a change from the ape found lying on his back on the floor of his wire cage unable to move.

The plight of the orangutan in Indonesia has reached a critical stage, with the survival of the species under serious threat. Animals are suffering and dying because of the destruction of the rainforest - primarily for palm oil production.

International Animal Rescue is working in West Kalimantan, Borneo to rescue and care for baby orangutans that have been taken from their mothers to be illegally sold as pets, and adults that have spent their entire lives in captivity, chained up or imprisoned in tiny cages. 

The team also goes to the aid of orangutans stranded when their forest home is destroyed and relocates these vulnerable animals to safe areas of protected forest.  

Alan Knight OBE, the Sussex-based charity's chief executive, said: 'Budi has won the hearts of people across the world and we’re overwhelmed and delighted by the generosity the public has shown in supporting his treatment and care.

'It’s an absolute joy to see the transformation in him and know that he is no longer in pain. 

'It’s a great testimony to the skill and dedication of our team that Budi is progressing so well. And clearly he is a little fighter with a strong will to survive. 

'Thanks to everyone who is helping to pay for his treatment and care, he has the best possible chance of a full recovery. 

'We really hope people will continue to follow and support his journey back to full health. 

'He still has a long road ahead of him and will be at our centre for several years to come, so we need all the help we can get with his rehabilitation in the hope that one day he will be fit to return to the forest and fend for himself.'

The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild.

If Budi doesn't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life.

Lis Key, from International Animal Rescue, said: 'When MailOnline reported the story of Budi the baby orangutan on January 22, it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world.

Singer/songwriter Sia tweeted her support for Budi

'Budi has appeared on websites, blogs and TV in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and America.'

Fearne Cotton, Joss Stone and Ricky Gervais have tweeted their support for the orangutan.

The latest celebrity to give her backing to the fundraising campaign is singer and songwriter Sia Furler, who currently has two songs in the Official UK Top 40 Singles Chart.

Although Budi is on the road to recovery, his moving story is far from unique.

Mr Knight explained: 'Including Budi, we now have 84 orangutans in our rescue centre in Borneo and every one of them has a story that would make you weep. 

'We’re always in need of money to pay for their care and rehabilitation. 

International Animal Rescue, based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world.

Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries.

Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild.

International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations.

It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect.

'We’re hoping that public interest and concern for Budi will make people want to find out more about our rescue and rehabilitation project as a whole and help us care for these tragic victims of relentless deforestation and the illegal trade in primates.' 

To donate £10 towards the cost of Budi's care, please text BUDI10 £10 to 70070.
