Bad drivers and illegal parkers – consider yourselves warned.

The online community is taking a stand against dangerous and stupid motorists, using Facebook to name and shame the culprits.

It’s hoped that by identifying those responsible of reckless driving, the public humiliation will stop them from re-offending, or persuade them to be more considerate.

A Christchurch Facebook page is the latest to join the campaign, showcasing some of the worst human hazards on New Zealand roads.

This is a park, right? A driver is incapable of distinguishing the difference between the road (good for parking) and the curb (bad for parking)

Good luck everybody else! A car blatantly parks another car in, with its tail end in the middle of the road

If parking in a disabled parking space without a permit wasn't bad enough, this car chose to park in the lane horizontally. As you do.

It's unknown who was in the wrong in this sticky situation, but it's clear that it all ended wrong, with the sedan sandwiched between the curb and a truck

In August, Daily Mail reported about the Australian 'Wall of Shame' Facebook page, posting photos of hundreds of fully-capable motorists parking in disabled parking spaces.

The phenomenon has continued, with the Shocking Christchurch Drivers Facebook page gaining more than 8000 likes in just five days, with Facebook users uploading shocking photographs of stupid motorist behaviour. 

The number plate and any identifying features are always published to ensure maximum embarrassment.

The Facebook page makes it clear that driving a flash car, doesn't mean the person can drive at all

It appears this car space wasn't spacious enough for 'Mitch', with the tail end of the car taking up half of the space behind. Although Mitch didn't have time to correct his park, he could put up his foil car sunshade

This fancy pants corvette doesn't follow the rules! This park speaks for itself - irritating and obnoxious 

Commenters thrill in guffawing at the outrageous photographs and videos – which include a driver taking up four parking spots, drivers parked diagonally across disabled parking space and even a motorist on the wrong side of the road.

But some examples of terrible driving aren’t just inconvenient or ridiculous – some submissions to the website show shocking moments that put the lives of the driver and all other motorists in mortal danger.

Helmet camera footage from a motorbike rider shows a car driving onto the wrong side of the road to try and overtake another car, when a car turns the corner, narrowly avoiding a head on collision.

This driver 'kind of' parked in a disabled parking space. But he also 'kind of' parked on the pavement, so maybe that's okay

Somehow, four car spaces seems a little... The car owner will have plenty of new enemies by the time they return to their car  

Not only is this a terrible park, this Facebook user indicates that there were nine WORSE parks before it

Hopefully the driver on the right wasn't hoping to go anywhere in a hurry, with the driver of the car on the left somehow thinking this was an acceptable park

Another video from a dashboard camera shows a truck changing lanes, seemingly oblivious to a vehicle in its path, forcing the car to hastily veer off the road.

The site’s administrator, Steve (surname withheld) says he has been blown away by the number of outrageous incidents that have been published on the Facebook page and hopes the Facebook page can change people’s behaviour on the roads.

'Race 1' is parked in the middle of the footpath, with absolutely no consideration to pedestrians 

Note to self: remember the handbrake! The plumber driving this van was not having a good morning

The mind boggles: let's just assume this driver had had enough of driving for one day when they left their car in this ridiculous position

‘As both a cyclist and motorist, I am concerned to see how many people take chances on the road, (such as) cyclists being knocked off by cars (and) crazy driving in rush hour traffic to gain a couple of spaces in front,’ Steve told stuff.co.nz 

‘If putting this online will help slow some people down, or stop them running a red light, or make them more aware of others - then it's job done really.’

A Christchurch police spokeswoman said police could investigate serious roading incidents on social media, but typically needed to receive a complaint and evidence from someone, according to stuff.co.nz.

Not one but two disabled parking spots: the epitomy of at least if this driver was going to be a bad driver, they decided to be VERY good at that

Innovative parking: this car decides to create its own car space in close proximity to the shops. Wonderful!
