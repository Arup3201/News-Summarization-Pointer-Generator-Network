A senior Syrian forensic medicine expert with evidence that President Bashar al-Assad's administration used chemical weapons in an attack in March has defected to Turkey, the opposition claimed today.

Abdeltawwab Shahrour, head of the forensic medicine committee in Aleppo, Syria's second city, was said last night to be preparing to make the evidence public - a move that could help to provide powerful backing for those in the U.S. administration supporting military action against the Assad regime.

He was the civilian in charge of the chemical weapons programme's medical and forensic science department so potentially is a hugely significant figure in any investigations into the use of nerve gas.

It also emerged today that the regime in Damascus is hiding military hardware and shifting troops out of bases into civilian areas as the threat of American air strikes looms.

Dr Shahrour was reported to have been kidnapped from his home in Aleppo on August 16, five days before the Damascus attack, but this may have been a false trail designed to allow his family to be smuggled out of the country safely.

Claims of the defection followed rumours that an even more senior figure had defected.

The main Western-backed opposition group
 says that during the buildup last week to what seemed like an imminent 
U.S. attack, the army moved troops as well as rocket launchers, 
artillery and other heavy weapons into residential neighborhoods in 
cities nationwide.

The evidence is alleged to have smuggled to Istanbul does not relate to the most recent attacks in the suburbs of Damascus that killed up to 1,700 on August 21 sparking British and U.S. calls for military strikes but to an earlier incident.

At least 26 people died in what was alleged to be a chemical weapons attack in the Aleppo suburb of Khan al-Assal on March 19 - a shelling that killed several government soldiers at a checkpoint and both sides blamed on one another.

It is said to have been the first time that chemical weapons had been used in the two year civil war.

Opposition officials said last night 
Dr Shahrour had documents proving that a chemical weapons attack took 
place and eye-witness accounts from police authorities that contradicted
 the administration's version of events.

It is unclear whether he had any evidence relating to the Damascus attacks.

Three Damascus residents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, confirmed the army movments into residential areas.

One man said two members of the elite Republican Guards broke into an empty house he owns and showed him an official document stating they were authorized to do so because Syria is at war. A woman in another area said soldiers moved into a school next to her house.

A U.S. official confirmed there are indications that the Syrian regime is taking steps to move some of its military equipment and bolster protection for defense facilities.

The official, who was not authorized to discuss intelligence matters and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at this point, the U.S. has the information it needs to maintain a good handle on what the regime is doing to prepare.

The trend inside Syria is likely to continue in the coming days now that the regime has won a reprieve with President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional approval for military action.

'The Syrian regime knows there are 30-40 potential targets for U.S. airstrikes, and they have had ample time to prepare,' said Hisham Jaber, a retired Lebanese army general and director of the Middle East Center for Studies and Political Research in Beirut.

'Half of them, if not more, have been evacuated, moved or camouflaged. This is the natural thing to do.'

A team of U.N. experts who visited Syria last month to investigate allegations of the use of chemicals weapons had originally planned to visit Khan al-Assal but ended up focusing on a much larger apparent poison gas attack near the Syrian capital.

Russia, which alongside Iran is Syria's closest ally and chief arms supplier, said in July its own scientific analysis indicated the attack had involved the nerve agent sarin and had most likely been carried out by the rebels.

Both sides deny using chemical weapons.

Dr Shahrour was reported to have been kidnapped from his home in regime-held Aleppo on August 16, five days before the Damascus attack but this may have been a false trail designed to allow his family to be smuggled out of the country safely.

News of the defection followed rumours 
that an even more senior figure, a general from the Assad family's 
Alawite sect, had defected but it is not clear whether that was a 
separate case, or a case of mistaken identity.

Shahrour's testimony could help to provide powerful backing for those in the U.S. administration supporting military action against the Assad regime. Pictured today, an F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea

Dr Shahrour was expected to reveal the details of the attack during a press conference in Turkey but Syrian National Council spokesperson Khaled Saleh said he was unable to appear due to 'security concerns'.

Mr Saleh added that the national council has received information in the last few days that three government convoys were carrying chemical weapons and one had reached a military airport.

He said: 'We have serious concerns based on the information that we have received from sources inside the Assad army who are sympathetic to the revolution that Assad might be considering using those chemical weapons against innocent civilians.'

Activists say the nerve agent Sarin was used in the alleged chemical weapons attack in Damascus.

Sarin is colourless, tasteless and odourless, unlike mustard gas which smells of rotten onions or garlic.

It is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Once a person has breathed in Sarin, death can occur within one to 10 minutes if there is no treatment. If it is drunk, the victim can survive for up to 18 hours.

A fraction of an ounce of the nerve agent on the skin can be fatal.

Exposure to the gas causes pupils to shrink to pinpoint sizes and foaming at the lips.

Symptoms include paralysis, loss of consciousness and respiratory failure.

Treatment needs to be given straight away and antidotes include Atropine and pralidoxime chloride.

Syria is believed to have one of the largest arsenals in the world of chemical weapons, including Sarin and mustard gas.
