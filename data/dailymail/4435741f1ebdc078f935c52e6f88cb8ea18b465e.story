Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was yesterday suspended from the soap after he was charged with child sex offences.

The 48-year-old actor, who has played mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV series for 30 years, insists he is innocent of the allegations – which include child rape – and has vowed to ‘fight the charges vigorously’.

However, the show’s bosses said he would not be appearing in any further episodes while legal proceedings are under way.

The actor was first arrested under his
 real name, Michael Turner, in September 2011 and questioned after a 
teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her from the age of six.

Three months later, however, 
prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take the allegations
 to court and no charges were brought.

At the time the father of two said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely exonerated’.

He thanked police for their ‘thorough 
investigation’, and expressed his gratitude to fans and the Coronation 
Street cast for their loyal support during ‘a most difficult and 
upsetting phase in my life’.

He returned to the show after a short break and is currently involved in some of its main storylines.

Stalwart: Michael Le Vell, real name Michael Turner, has been in the ITV soap since 1983 and is one of the country's biggest soap stars, and like his character, it has emerged how much he enjoys a drink

However, on Thursday evening it was 
announced that after a review of the evidence, Le Vell had been charged 
with 19 sex offences, including raping a child, indecently assaulting a 
child and sexual activity with a child.

There was no sign of the actor 
yesterday at the £325,000, two-bed terraced house he has been renting in
 Hale, Greater Manchester, since separating from his wife  Janette 
Beverley and leaving the family home in 2011. But in a  statement he 
said that following the serious allegations that had been made, he 
wanted to make it ‘quite clear’ that he was ‘innocent of these charges 
and intend to fight them vigorously’. He added:  ‘I will now put all my 
efforts into clearing my name and proving my innocence.’

Charged: Michael Le Vell has been charged with child sex offences, whose real name is Michael Turner, will appear in court later this month

Thanking friends, family and fans for 
their continued support, he said he would now concentrate on preparing 
his defence. An ITV spokesman said: ‘Given the serious nature of these 
charges, Michael Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street 
pending the outcome of legal proceedings.

‘It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.’

Greater Manchester Police said the 
rethink over charging Le Vell had followed a review of evidence by the 
Crown Prosecution Service and related to ‘offences against a child 
between 2001 and 2010’.

Alison Levitt QC, principal legal 
adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ‘I have very 
carefully reviewed the evidence in this case and I have concluded that 
there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge 
Michael Robert Turner with a number of sexual offences.’

Le Vell will appear in court in Manchester later this month.

Originally from Manchester, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop.

He joined Coronation Street in 1983 
and quickly endeared himself to fans who have followed the trials and 
tribulations of Kevin, from being Brian Tilsley’s apprentice mechanic 
through to his stormy marriage to Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and 
fathering two teenage girls as well as a child from his affair with 
Molly Dobbs.

Early years: Le Vell in an episode of Coronation Street from 1987

Born Michael Turner in Newton Heath, Manchester, Michael Le Vell is best known for the role of garage mechanic Kevin Webster, in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street.

After taking an interest in amateur dramatics while at school, Le Vell began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop.

He landed the role on Coronation Street after a making short guest appearance in the show as the paperboy Neil Grimshaw.

He had attended an audition at Granada Studios for the series Scully, where he met casting director Judy Hayfield who presumed he was there to audition for Coronation Street.

She asked him to return the following day to audition and he was offered the part.

He first appeared as Webster in the soap on October 19 1983, moving in with Hilda Ogden as her lodger and getting a job as an apprentice mechanic with Brian Tilsley.

Le Vell has featured in some of Coronation Street's most explosive storylines, most recently Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs.

After twenty-six years in the role, Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'.

He has also starred in the BBC shows Fame is the Spur and One by One.

During the 1980s Le Vell became something of a gay icon and would receive a high volume of fan mail from gay men.

This was reportedly due to the fact he wore tight jeans and a moustache and appeared on screen with his left ear pierced.

He later claimed that the attention from gay men ended as soon after he shaved off his moustache.

He married Coronation Street Co-star Janette Beverley in October 1986. They couple have two children together but split last year.

He was a member of the celebrity 'All Stars' football team which play charity matches and was hospitalised during a match in 2007.
