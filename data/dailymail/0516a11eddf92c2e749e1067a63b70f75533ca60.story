Criticism: Guenther Oettinger was scathing in his summary of EU states

A leading EU mandarin said David Cameron is a 'hobbled' prime minister in a speech in which he blasted the state of the continent and declared: 'Europe is ripe for an overhaul.' 

Guenther Oettinger singled out Bulgaria, Romania and Italy as 'essentially ungovernable' and derided eurosceptic MPs in the British parliament as 'unspeakable backbenchers, his English Tea Party' - a reference to the right-wing protest party in the USA.

Oettinger is a leading member of German chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, his nation's EU energy commissioner and a former state premier of the wealthy state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.

His comments have sent alarm through the corridors of power in both Brussels and Berlin as he is at his core a firm believer in the European project and not a man to ignore.

But Oettinger pulled no punches in his Tuesday night speech to a German, Belgian and Luxembourgian Chambers of Commerce meeting in Brussels on Tuesday evening.

He said: 'It worries me that too many in Europe still believe that everything will be fine. Europe is ripe for overhaul.'

He added that Brussels had spent more time patting itself on the back about how Europe is civilised and a shining example to the rest of the world 'instead of fighting the financial and economic crisis'.

He said many EU members had 'ceased to function' politically and said it worried him about 'essentially ungovernable' nations.

He also slammed France, currently in turmoil over a gay marriage law, as being 'completely unprepared to do what’s necessary to get its economy back on track'.

He slammed the fact that it has twice as many civil servants as other EU nations 'but no middle class and little in the way of innovation'.

Oettinger did not spare his own country in his speech, delivered at a time when 17 of the 27 nations of the EU are still in recession and the politics of austerity seem to have failed miserably.

Although largely unscathed by the euro crisis because of its strong export economy, he said his nation is jeopardizing its economic success with a false political agenda.

'Germany is at the highpoint of its economic ability. Germany will not get any stronger pursuing an agenda of child-care subsidies, quotas for women, minimum wage and rejecting fracking for natural gas,' he said.

He criticised Germans for worrying about the effects of fracking - the process whereby natural gas or oil deposits are retrieved through polluting high-pressure splitting of subterranean rock - but did not have the same concerns for the environment in Russia from where Germany imports much of its gas.

'That's what I call hypocrisy,' he said. 'The Germans are a pretty hypocritical lot.'

He said environmentalists had to accept certain risks if the continent's energy supply needs were to be met in the future.
