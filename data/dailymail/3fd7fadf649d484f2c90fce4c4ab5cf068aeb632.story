A coroner has described the death of a man who was found standing up in his kitchen as 'bizarre'.

A friend called out when he saw Andrew Evans, 35, through the window standing up with his hand reaching into a cupboard in the kitchen of his East Grinstead, West Sussex home.

But it was only when he received no reply and let himself in that Mr Evans's friend realised that he was dead.

Verdict: The coroner ruled that Andrew Evans's death was accidental at Horsham Coroner's Court, pictured

Mr Evans had injured his head before his death on May 10, but it is not known how seriously.

Horsham Coroner's court heard how Mr Evans was four times the drink drive limit when he died.

It is thought that he died after blacking out as he reached into a cupboard in his kitchen

His body is said to have fallen against the kitchen fittings and he remained standing up.

His injury had caused him to bleed heavily, but the court heard he might not have realised how serious the injury was 'because of his intoxicated state'.

Coroner Dr David Skipp said at the inquest last week that the death was 'strange', but said he died from asphyxiation of the lungs.

He said: 'It is unusual for a man whose alcohol levels were high to be found stood against a work surface.

'He obviously did not try to get out of the flat after banging his head and the evidence suggests he was not bothered by what was going on - It is bizarre.'

A verdict of accidental death was recorded.
