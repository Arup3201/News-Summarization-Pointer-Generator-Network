Rebekah Brooks stood among former News International colleagues in court yesterday and denied any role in the phone hacking scandal.

The ex-chief executive took centre stage in a dock filled with figures from the media giant, who were represented by 29 of Britain’s top barristers.

Brooks, 45, stood beside her racehorse trainer husband Charlie, who arrived at court clutching a copy of the Racing Post, to deny five charges linked to three alleged criminal conspiracies.

Hearing: Rebekah Brooks, right, and her husband Charlie arrive at Southwark Crown Court where they both denied all the offences they are charged with

She is accused of conspiring to hack 
mobile phones, conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office by 
paying public officials for stories and conspiring to pervert the course
of justice.

The offences are alleged to have taken
place between October 2000 and July 2011, the period when she rose from
being editor of the News of the World to take the same role at The Sun 
before running the newspaper publisher.

In a rare move, Mr Justice Saunders 
allowed reporters and the  public to stand for the two-hour hearing 
after every possible seat was filled, with more wanting to watch 
proceedings.

They were joined by campaigning MP Tom
Watson and lawyer Mark Lewis, who represents the family of murdered 
schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Brooks, who was arrested almost two 
years ago in relation to alleged phone hacking, chatted to her 
co-defendants in the reinforced glass dock at Southwark Crown Court, 
Central London, and took notes on the back of a blue envelope.

Her former secretary, Cheryl Carter, 
49, also pleaded not guilty  to a charge of perverting the course of 
justice. It is alleged that Brooks and Carter tried to remove boxes of 
archived material from News International between July 6 and 9, 2011.

Court

Court: Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman (left) and Sun reporter John Kay (right) arrive at Southwark Crown Court, where their cases are listed. Kay has already denied conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Goodman denied two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office

Six other people close to her, 
including Brooks’s 50-year-old husband, also denied a second charge of 
conspiracy to cause misconduct in a public office.

The others were News International 
security director Mark Hanna, 50, security officer Lee Sandell, 27, 
chauffeur Paul Edwards, 48, and her former bodyguard David Johnson, 47.

They are accused of attempting to hide documents, computers and other 
electronic equipment from officers investigating phone hacking and 
corruption.

Court appearance: Former News of the World executive Stuart Kuttner, 73, (left) denied conspiracy to intercept communications. Lee Sandell (right) denied conspiracy to pervert the course of justice

Former Metropolitan Police 
Constable Paul Flattley has been jailed for selling information on 
high-profile figures including Kate Middleton to a Sun journalist.

He was jailed in March and the case can be reported for the first time after a charge against the reporter was dropped.

The CPS have abandoned their case 
against Virginia Wheeler after medical reports had been sought by both 
prosecution and defence.

Flattley, 30, was paid thousands of 
pounds for information over the course of three years, between May 2008 
and September 2011. He passed on details about high-profile cases, as 
well as checking out tip-offs that the tabloid had received.

Former News of the World managing 
editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and news editor James Weatherup, 57, also 
pleaded not guilty to phone hacking, while ex-royal reporter Clive 
Goodman denied charges of conspiracy to cause misconduct in a public 
office.

Other staff, including Andy Coulson, 
who took over as editor of the News of the World after Brooks, are 
expected to enter pleas this week.

Every defendant spoke only to confirm their name and plead not guilty as the charges were put to them by the clerk of the court.

Mrs Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire,
is expected to go on trial at Southwark Crown Court on September 9.

The
charges arise from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard’s 
multi-million-pound inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal, which 
spawned Operation Elveden into corrupt payments to public officials and 
Operation Sacha, into allegations of a cover-up.

All the defendants were released on bail and declined to comment.
