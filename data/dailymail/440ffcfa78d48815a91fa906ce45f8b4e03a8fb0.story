Still standing: Ambam has shown that he still enjoys a good walk about as pictures emerged of him strolling around upright at Port Lympne wild animal park near Hythe, Kent

Western lowland gorilla normally get around on all fours, but Ambam has perfected balancing on his two hind legs.

Footage of his upright walking has been viewed by millions on the internet since 2011. 

His habit of walking like a human is also exhibited by his sister Tamba and her two-year-old son Kabale, a park spokesman said. 

Weighing 220kg, Ambam is Port Lympne's biggest gorilla. The lifespan for a western lowland can stretch from 30 to 50 years. He was born at the park's sister site, Howletts, in 1990.

On all fours: Ambam, who lives at  Port Lympne wild animal park near Hythe, Kent, shows how western lowland gorillas normally get around 

He was hand-raised for a few months when he was a year old after falling ill, meaning he had to be taken away from his mother Shumba.

The precise number of western lowland gorillas is unclear because they inhabit some of the most dense and remote rainforests in Africa.

But wildlife experts say that due to poaching and disease, as well as Ebola-induced mortality, their numbers have declined by more than 60 per cent over the past 20 to 25 years.
