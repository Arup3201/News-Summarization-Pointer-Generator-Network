The daddy of all Formula 1 games is back.

And now, thanks to loads of improvements, you’ll be able to feel the passion, speed and glory of the world’s most glamorous sport like never before.

Yes, it’s F1 2012, which developers say is the most accessible and immersive F1 game out there. And, as an F1 ‘noob’, I’d have to agree.

Formula fun: Yet again, the F1 game is shaping up to be a classic

This is largely due to the ingenious Young Drivers Test. Here, F1 novices are taught the basics of the sport through tutorials, and learn how to get the best from their cars.

This even includes how to use the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) and the DRS (Drag Reduction System).

When you’re ready, you can test out your moves in a variety of different game modes.

These include Champions mode – where you’re thrown straight into the action against one of six world champions (Kimi Räikkönen, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher) to try and beat them and become the ultimate champion.

Then there’s the Season Challenge, where you take part in ten races. You start as a low-ranking team and select a rival driver you think you can beat.

As you beat him over a series of races, you will win their seat in the better car – eventually working your way through the field to become champion.

Of course, if you’re still not up to the challenge, F1 2012 features all-new lap walk-throughs from F1 test driver Anthony Davidson.

Davidson will talk the player through a lap of each of the 20 circuits on the 2012 calendar, highlighting braking points, gearing and giving expert technical advice which will help players find extra speed on every lap.

There have been the usual graphical upgrades, too. One massive improvement is the localised weather system. This results in sudden weather changes in different parts of the track.

Breathtaking: The attention to detail really is something to behold

When one part of the track is wet while other areas are dry, the race will become more unpredictable and you’ll have to make game-changing strategy calls.

'The whole weather scenario system has really been refined this year,” said Paul Jeal, Game Director.

'You’ll get weather fronts come in now and then and it could be raining at one section of the track but dry on another.

'You get those moments where you’re not sure which tyres to be on and that really mixes up the racing.'

The general look has improved, too. The EGO engine has been tweaked so graphics seem sharper this time around. The attention to detail is fantastic, with dynamic lighting shining off the cars.

Handling, however, does take some getting used to – no matter what difficulty you’re on, is hard to manage.

But it’s incredibly rewarding when you get it right, and there are useful speed / break markers which help keep you on course.

'Significant work has gone into the physics model, particularly the suspension, which has a real change on the feel of the car,’ said Stephen Hood, Creative Director.

'You can really attack the track. It’s those extra elements that make you feel like a real F1 driver.’

And for those after authenticity, then look no further.

Photorealistic: Squint your eyes and you'll feel that you're watching a race on TV

All twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season will feature, and the brand-new, incomplete Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas — is included in the championship.

Drivers, start your engines. It’s due out September 21.
