The runaway mom who went missing for 11 years before walking into a police station last week had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind.

It emerged this week that Brenda Heist, who was eventually presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going missing from their Pennsylvania home, was actually building a new life for herself on the other side of the country. 

Her new friends have spoken of their shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out.

Second life: Brenda Heist disappeared for 11 years before handing herself in last week. She never told her new friends she had left her family

Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police office last Friday

For a time she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and living with friends.

Pictures reveal her drinking, swimming and hanging out with her new acquaintances to whom she never told her real story.

'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her 
friend's eyes, that are calling us today," Detective Sergeant Schofield,
who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online.

Sondra Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.'

Another friend who knew Heist as 'Lovie Smith' said she had no idea she was being deceived.

'I can’t believe she was being so dishonest… can’t believe she had 
kids,' she told CBS Philly.

Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania

Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants.

She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce.

When building her new life she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died.

She never revealed she 
had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been 
murdered.

'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said.

'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.'

It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - 
lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients.

When the deception was discovered she moved on again.

Over the 11 years she is said to have three aliases.

She also went by Kelsei Smith and even served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered.

For a time it seems she was homeless although where and when is unclear.

Her real identity didn't emerge until she turned up at a Florida police station this week.

And as the news came out her family reacted in horror that they had been living a lie

Her daughter, Morgan Heist, 19, took to Twitter to reveal how angry she was after realizing her mother had willfully left.

'This doesn't 
seem real. I feel like I'm in my own horrible nightmare and can't wake 
up.'

She also tweeted that she was glad her father was now exonerated of any blame or suspicion about his wife's disappearance.

'To every person who ever questioned my dads place in my moms dissapearance, (sic) take that.'

Happy: Friends countered Heist's suggestions that she had lived poorly revealing for a time she worked as a cleaner and had an active social life

Shock: New friends of Heist were shocked to hear of her real identity and that she'd left her family 11 years before

All grown up: Morgan Heist, pictured with her brother Lee, has said she wishes she had never cried for her missing mom who has finally showed up after eleven years

Morgan Heist's Twitter updates since finding out last Friday that her mom is still alive reveal a young woman whose joy has quickly turned to anger

On
Sunday she wrote: 'Tomorrow will be the day I will hopefully finally 
get closure in my life. I need the truth more than anything.'

But later that day she tweeted: 'My brother and I don't want contact with her as of now.'

By the next day her tweets about her mom had become more negative: 'You were finally becoming less and less of a memory. Now? You're a horrible nightmare.'

Since then they have continued in a similar vein. 'To think I would EVER want to talk to a woman like you.. I can't believe I wanted to possibly see you. F*** you "mother."

Another read: 'You will never gain my love or respect. You deserve to rot in hell for what you have done to me.'

Morgan also revealed to the media on Wednesday that knowing what she knows now, she wishes she never cried over her mom's fate.

Heist’s ex-husband meanwhile has said he is angry but working on forgiveness.

'There were families who would not let our children play with theirs because of me,' says Lee Heist Senior.

Heist's mother says she's since been released from police custody and is staying with a brother in northern Florida.

Anger: Her children Morgan Heist, 19, and her brother Lee, 23, have reacted angrily to the news and say they want nothing to do with her

She was reported missing by 
her husband on February 8, 2002. The then 42-year-old was last seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, 
Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle.

Last Friday she walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida, and announced who she was.

Heist has told detectives she left her family because the 
pressure was too much and she snapped.

She said she joined  a group of homeless people that she met in a park who were hitch-hiking to Florida.

Former home: Brenda Heist walked out on this house in Lititz, Pennsylvania on February 8, 2002 that she shared with her husband Lee and two children

Disbelief: Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home

When she disappeared, Heist's daughter 
was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester 
University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey. Her 
daughter is a sophomore at West Chester University.

'She said she thought of her family and her children every day, and her 
parents. However, she never acted on that and never made any phone calls
– not one,' Lititz Police Detective John Schofield told 8WGAL.

She told police that she had decided to turn herself in because she was at the end of her rope and was having health 
problems. She now hopes to live with her mom in Texas.

'I can't believe that she would leave her two children,' former neighbor Arlene Bingeman told 8WGAL. 'I just can't, as a mother, I just can't believe that.'

Local, state and federal authorities spent months investigating Heist's disappearance in 2002, interviewing dozens of relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was entered into several national missing persons databases.

Her husband eventually collected her life insurance policy in 2010.
