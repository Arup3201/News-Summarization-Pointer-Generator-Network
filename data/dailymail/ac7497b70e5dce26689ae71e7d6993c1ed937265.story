Everton manager Roberto Martinez has boldly predicted his 20-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley will go onto become the best English player of all-time.

Two days before Wayne Rooney was handed his 100th cap by World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton, the Everton manager told club supporters at a Q&A event entitled 'An Audience with Roberto Martinez' that local boy Barkley would go on to surpass the achievements of both.

'There is no doubt in my mind he will be the best player England has ever had,' Martinez told the audience at the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool.

Ross Barkley will become England's greatest-ever player, according to Everton boss Roberto Martinez

Toffees manager Martinez was speaking to supporters at an Everton Q&A event on Thursday evening 

'Ross has everything. Normally a player has the pace and power to get around the pitch or they have the vision to pick a pass.

'Ross can do both of those things, and he is technically gifted with both feet. Not only that, he is in love with the game.'

Manchester City would love Barkley at The Etihad but it would cost them a British record £60million with Everton under no financial pressure to sell.

Martinez added: 'He will probably be the biggest asset Everton have ever had' though he was referring to his qualities as a player rather than his valuation.

Barkley played for England at the World Cup last summer and has been used wide or as a No 10 by Martinez.
