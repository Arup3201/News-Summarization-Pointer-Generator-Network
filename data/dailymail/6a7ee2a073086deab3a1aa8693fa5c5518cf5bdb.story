A 62-year-old woman from Oklahoma survived without food and only rain water for 8 days in her car after a cancerous tumor swelled in her body and caused her to become disoriented.

Kay Springer, 62, disappeared in June and was found barely alive in a ditch eight days later.

Fox reports that Springer was running errands but became confused and she ended up near the Arkansas River below a highway 62 in Muskogee.

Lost and starving: Kay Springer was stuck in a muddy embankment for eight days with no food and just rainwater

Survivor: Kay Springer used shopping bags to collect rainwater to drink

Her car became stuck in the mud and she was trapped with no way of climbing up the steep embankment.

Springer knew that somehow she needed to get water in order to survive.

Luckily, Springer had some shopping bags with her so she hung them from her car and used them to collect rainwater.

'I’d tie them up and hang them on the car doors,' Springer told FOX.

Springer didn't think she'd live. Not only was she stuck in the mud with no way of escaping, she was delirious and ill.

'People ask me if I was afraid. Well, I didn’t have the brain capacity to be afraid,' Springer said.

Stuck: Kay Springer, 62, had a cancerous tumor which led her to drive her car to this embankment and get lost

In recovery: Kay Springer, 62, had her cancerous tumor removed and is undergoing radiation therapy and is spending time with her four grandchildren

'The tumor came back and swelled up and just knocked me out,' said Springer.

Springer told reporters that she hallucinated and thought she saw rescue workers when there were none, her own children, and movie stars.

'I begged and I pleaded for someone to help me and no one would,”' Springer said.

Finally a fisherman spotted her from a river.

'And I thought OK, is this guy real? Is he my miracle?' Springer said.

Springer was safely returned to her family and has since had all of her tumour removed.

Springer is undergoing radiation therapy and spending time with her four grandchildren.

'I was not going to die down there. I’d have sat there forever. I was not going to die,' Springer said.
