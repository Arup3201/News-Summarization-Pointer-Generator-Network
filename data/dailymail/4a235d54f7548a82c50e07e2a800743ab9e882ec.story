Notorious inmate Charles Bronson has reportedly claimed  Ronnie Kray 'lived like a lord' inside Broadmoor - with a huge stash of cigarettes and even tins of salmon.

The 61-year-old armed robber told a pen pal the secure psychiatric hospital, where he spent six years from 1978 to 1984 under his real name Michael Peterson, was like a 'f****** corner shop'.

Violent hostage-taker Bronson has been in and out of jail for most of his life since the stint at Broadmoor - which nonetheless he hated and protested with an 18-day hunger strike.

Claims: Bronson is said to have described Broadmoor (above) as 'like a f****** corner shop'

In a letter obtained by The Sun he is said to describe a life of luxury by East End gangster Kray, who he befriended at HMP Parkhurst before being reunited with him at Broadmoor.

According to the newspaper, he told an unnamed 'pen pal': 'It was like a f****** corner shop. Ronnie was living the life of a lord. I'd never seen nothing like it.

'I'd just had a load of years in prison with nothing. All of a sudden I'm sitting there and eating tins of salmon.'

He added Kray, then in his late 40s, had a comfortable stash of food and cigarettes. 

Bronson, who changed his name again to Charles Salvador earlier this year, is infamous for being one of Britain's most violent prisoners.

Raised in Aberystwyth, west Wales, he began committing robberies aged 13 and has been held in solitary confinement for long stints totalling well over two decades since 1974.

Unrepentant: Bronson's violent past has not stopped him earning a string of pen pals and a marriage in jail

He was given a life sentence after holding a prison art teacher hostage in 1999 and has committed a string of violent offences since.

His latest conviction was in September for taking hostage the governor of Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, and holding him in a headlock.

Reggie Kray once described an encounter with him in jail as 'the most frightening visit I had'.

But the violent inmate has his supporters, including an appeal fund which claims it is time for him to be released. 

He has struck up friendships with pen pals before, including in 2009 when he wrote a romantic string of letters to one-time actress and glamour model Gemini Reynolds. 

Under the spotlight: Broadmoor will soon be the subject of a book co-authored by Bronson

The Cyprus-based 50-year-old said at the time: 'He's not a monster in my eyes. I hope he gets downgraded and rehabilitated toward his freedom. There is no reason why he should not.' 

Bronson even  married  a pen pal inside prison in 2001, but he divorced Saira Rehman after four years and renounced her Muslim faith, to which he had briefly converted.

He is now believed to have co-authored a book about Broadmoor, due for release next year.

An organiser of his release fund  dismissed the remarks about Ronnie Kray - if true - as a likely 'throwaway comment in a confidential letter' and little more.
