Texas Governor Rick Perry will not have a warrant issued for his arrest but could be forced to pose for a mugshot.

The Republican's fate was decided on Monday when a judge issued a summons after a grand jury indicted him for felony charges.

But the governor still faces the unflattering prospect of being booked, fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at some point.

Presidential hopeful: Gov. Perry's aides said the case won't derail his busy travel schedule as he continues to eye a second run for the White House in 2016

According to sources, the governor has
 assembled a team of high-powered attorneys to fight the two felony 
counts of abuse of power against him.

However, leading
 conservatives around the country have come out in support of the 
longest-serving governor in Texas history.

'This
 is nothing more than banana republic politics,' Tony Buzbee a 
Houston-based defense attorney who will head a cadre of four lawyers 
from Texas and Washington defending Perry, said.

'The charges lobbed against the governor are a really nasty attack not 
only on the rule of law but on the Constitution of the United States, 
the state of Texas and also the fundamental constitutional protections 
that we all enjoy.'

Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris 
Christie, a potential rival for the 2016 race released a statement 
Monday saying he has 'complete faith and confidence in Governor Perry's 
honesty and integrity.'

This
 was echoed by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and 
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who may all may seek the GOP White House 
nomination.

Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said the charges 'could well help' Perry.

Gov. Branstad, a Republican said: 'It
 is an attack. It also is coming out of a county where you wouldn't 
expect even-handedness.'

On Monday, Republican Judge Bert Richardson 
decided against issuing an arrest warrant and instead a special 
prosecutor appointed to the matter was planning a simple legal summons.

But that still means a booking is in Gov. Perry's future although it's not known exactly when this will take place.

Mr
 Buzbee said: 'That's going to be something, that when he goes in to be 
booked and take his picture that we're going to let you know about.'

Gov. Perry's arraignment — a court appearance to answer the charges — could be held on Aug. 29 at 9 a.m.

A
 spokesman for Gov. Perry said that date had not been confirmed, adding 
that the governor wouldn't need to appear personally at the arraignment.

He will, however, have to appear at his booking.

A
 grand jury in Austin, a liberal bastion in otherwise largely 
conservative Texas, indicted Gov. Perry for carrying out a threat to 
veto $7.5 million in funding for the state's public integrity unit.

Travis
 County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, refused to 
resign following a drunken driving arrest. The ethics unit is housed 
under Ms Lehmberg's office.

No
 one disputes that Perry has the power to veto measures approved by the 
Legislature, but his threat to do so before actually carrying it out 
prompted a complaint from a left-leaning watchdog.

The
 grand jury met for months before handing down its indictment, and Gov. 
Perry's $450 per-hour defense attorney was paid using state funds.

Mr
 Buzbee said the public will continue footing the bill for the 
governor's now pricier legal team, though he said a private foundation 
could eventually be established to handle some of the costs.

After
 Gov. Perry avoided an arrest warrant questions were raised of 
favoritism, but legal observers said forgoing an arrest warrant is 
common in white-collar cases.

On Friday, Gov. Perry became the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted and is facing charges of coercion and official oppression that carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison.

He is also facing allegations of carrying out a threat to veto funding for the state's public integrity unit last summer. But the governor has emphatically stood by his veto and denied all wrongdoing.

But Gov. Perry's aides said the 
case won't derail his busy travel schedule.

He is still on schedule to visit several key presidential battleground states as he continues to eye a 
second run for the White House in 2016.

He will visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in the next two weeks.

He is also due to give a speech on Thursday on immigration at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.

The speech is an attempt to re-brand himself to a national audience after stumbling 
badly during his short-lived 2012 presidential campaign.

Former U.S. Attorney Matt Orwig said that insisting on an arrest warrant for Perry would have been 'grandstanding.'

'He's obviously not a flight risk or danger to the community,' Mr Orwig said.

Conservatives have also have been quick to note that a video recording made at the jail showed Ms Lehmberg shouting at staffers, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out at deputies.

Gov. Perry's attorneys showed the 'outrageous' video again while addressing reporters Monday.

Yet, Gov. Perry has not been backed by everyone.

Republican Gov. Tom Corbett's re-election campaign removed a video endorsement by the Texas governor from its website following Gov. Perry's indictment.
