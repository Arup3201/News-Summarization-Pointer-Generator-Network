A solid chalice made from a gold bar given to Queen Victoria at her coronation has been discovered.

The chalice made for London Mayor David Evans in 1891 from the 24-carat gold bar presented to the 19-year-old Queen is said to be worth £30,000.

Queen Victoria was given the gold bar as part of the ceremony of her coronation in 1838 before it was melted down and transformed into the 10in-high cup.

Royal gold: The chalice was made from a 24-carat gold bar presented to Queen Victoria at her coronation in Westminster Abbey in 1834

An inscription on one side reads: ‘This cup was made from the ingot of gold offered at the altar by Queen Victoria on her coronation in Westminster Abbey.’

It is not known what happened to the chalice after it was made for the mayor but it was bought at auction several years ago by its current owner.

The owner, an unnamed woman from Norfolk, paid £6,000 for it and although the inflated price of gold today would mean it was worth £10,000 if it was melted down, the association with Queen Victoria has raised its value to £30,000.

The prized possession was revealed publicly when it featured on the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow last Sunday.

Expert valuer Alastair Dickenson said: ‘It is a great privilege to handle such an amazing object as this.

‘During the Coronations of George III, IV, William IV and Queen Victoria, an ingot of gold was presented.

‘This cup was made out of that block of gold.’

The cup has a beautiful decoration on the bottom which includes the thistle, rose and shamrock to represent the national emblems of Scotland, England and Ireland.

Queen Victoria’s coronation was a huge occasion and some 400,000 visitors went to London to see the new Queen crowned after her uncle, King William IV died in 1837.
