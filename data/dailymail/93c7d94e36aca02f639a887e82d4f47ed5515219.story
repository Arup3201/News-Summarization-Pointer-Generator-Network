Baa baa Boston Terrier? This cute mutt sounds just like goat when he gets excited. And his talents don’t just stop there. He does a pretty mean dolphin impression, too.

Bruce the Boston Terrier is the Rory Bremner of the canine world. His excitement causes him to make silly noises.

The one-and-a-half year old dog can’t contain his delight when he sees other animals on the road.

Great impressionist: The dog's owner, Angela, says that her one-year-old dog 'just wants to play'

He gives voice to his frustration by with his funny imitations, bleating like a goat at one point and whistling like a dolphin the next.

Owner Angela,who posted the video on Youtube, said on the website that the Boston terrier 'makes the cutest dang noises when he sees other dogs. He just wants to play.'

Youtube user Kayla Hodge claimed it was 'nothing new', saying  'my little dog does that too. She's a chihuahua.'
