'Then from there he sexually assaulted the woman in the toilets,' Insp Phillips said.

The man did not sign in at the leagues club front desk and police believe he slipped past security when there was a large group at the front counter.

Insp Phillips says if a member of the public sees the man they shouldn't approach him but call 000.

'We believe this man is an extreme danger to the community because of his actions even prior to the sex assault,' he said.

'We have tried to pull him over for a RBT, he has initiated a pursuit and then committed a horrific act on a lady going about a normal night.'

The man is described as being of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern appearance, aged in his late 20s, approximately 170cm tall with a solid build and tanned complexion.

He has tattoos next to his eye.

He was wearing a black 'Nike' T-shirt with the words 'just do it' printed on it.
