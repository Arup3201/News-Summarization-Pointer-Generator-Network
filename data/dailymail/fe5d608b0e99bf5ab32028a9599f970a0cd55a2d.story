In their stunning traditional costumes, representatives of Chinese ethic minority communities bring a splash of colour to the normally dour world of politics.

The delegates, from all corners of China's vast territory, were attending the opening session of the annual National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Among the dazzling items on display were diamante and goat head-dresses, beautiful hand woven tunics, glittering jewellery and all manner of hats and head wear.

The National Peoples Congress has over 3,000 delegates making it the largest parliament in the world.

A largely ceremonial legislature it approves appointments to top government posts to manage the economic and foreign policies.

Hundreds of soldiers, police and 
plainclothes security officers - equipped with fire extinguishers and 
anti-explosive blankets - ringed the Great Hall and the adjacent 
Tiananmen Square for the opening session.

The public was kept well away 
behind cordons as the deputies gathered for the 13-day session.

Pledges: China's government promised its people it would fight corruption, improve the despoiled environment and address other quality-of-life issues demanded by an increasingly vocal public looking for change

The legislature, most of whose 
members belong to the party and are bound to vote as the leadership 
dictates, will approve a proposed streamlining of government ministries,
as well as appointments.

In reality, the decisions have already been made by the communist party leadership and party power-brokers behind closed doors.

China's government has pledged to 
repair the country's ravaged environment and boost public services under
its new leadership, an acknowledgment that quality of life was 
sidelined during the outgoing administration's decade of breakneck 
economic growth.

In a policy speech opening the 
national legislature's yearly session Tuesday, soon-to-retire Premier 
Wen Jiabao detailed a list of problems that had grown in recent years 
and was being left to his successors.

They included a sputtering growth model; 
poisoned air, waterways and soil; a vast and growing rich-poor gap; and 
rampant official corruption that has alienated many Chinese.

Yao's specialty is China's army of 
migrant workers who are often deprived of access to housing, education 
and other government services.

'If there's an economic downturn and 
massive unemployment, will the 200 million migrant workers become the 
main force of the next Cultural Revolution?' he said, referring to the 
excesses of the chaotic 1966-76 period.

The unfinished agenda of China's past
decade are now central concerns of the new leadership as it seeks to 
assuage a public that is looking beyond pocket-book issues, empowered by
the Internet and increasingly vocal about the need for change.

Wen acknowledged the responsibility 
he and other retiring leaders have for leaving such a tangle of 
problems, even as they have guided China to prosperity and power on the 
world stage.

'Some of these problems have built up
over time, while others have emerged in the course of economic and 
social development, and still others have been caused by inadequacies 
and weaknesses in our government work,' Wen said in a 100-minute speech 
to the nearly 3,000 legislative deputies in the Great Hall of the 
People, his last address before stepping down.

Though Wen delivered the address, it 
represents the priorities of the new leadership headed by Communist 
Party chief Xi Jinping and it underscores the inflection point many 
Chinese feel the country has reached: The policies that delivered 
stunning growth are foundering in the ill-effects of corruption and 
environmental degradation, and many Chinese believe benefits unfairly 
accrue to a party-connected elite.

The legislative session completes the
once-a-decade leadership transition that began four months ago when Xi 
and other younger leaders were installed as party leaders.
