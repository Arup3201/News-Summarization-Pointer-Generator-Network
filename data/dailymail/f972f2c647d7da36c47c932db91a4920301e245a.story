Vanishing spray will be used for the first time in English football at the FA Community Shield match between Arsenal and Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday.

The spray is used by referees to mark out a line for the wall to stand at free-kicks, 10 yards away from the ball, and disappears after a couple of minutes.

It will also be used in the Premier League for the new season after its success at the World Cup.

Now you see it...: The vanishing spray was seen as a big success at the World Cup and is coming to England

FA general secretary Alex Horne said: 'It is great that vanishing spray will be used for the first time in England in this Sunday's FA Community Shield fixture at Wembley Stadium.

'Vanishing spray was a great innovation at the 2014 World Cup, having been trialled in South America, and the FA were instrumental in allowing this into the laws of the game in 2012 through our role in the International FA Board.'
