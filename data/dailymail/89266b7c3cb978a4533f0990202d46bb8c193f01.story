Argentinians reacted with fury yesterday after the  Falkland Islands’ newspaper accidentally called their  president a ‘b****’.

The website of the Penguin News ran a photo of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to illustrate a story about her vitriolic speech about the territory.

But anyone who wanted to save the image found that its default file name was ‘b****’.

Angry: Penguin News has enraged Argentina by calling its leader a 'bitch' on its website, by using the insult as a file name on a photograph of her

Argentina’s La Nacion newspaper told readers that the word is ‘one of the strongest’ Anglo-Saxon terms of disrespect.

This triggered complaints from Argentinians, many of whom bombarded the email and Twitter accounts of the paper’s editor Lisa Watson with hundreds of foul-mouthed insults.

The photo was renamed and Miss Watson tweeted: ‘Not my aim to cause anger – but PN staff have naughty sense of humour.’

Yesterday she retweeted some of the messages. One read: ‘Invaders mother ******* go home!’ Another said: ‘Putaaaaaaaa.’ (The Spanish word for ‘whore’).

Defender: David Cameron said Argentina should be 'in no doubt that Britain will defend the Falkland Islands' against any threat to its people's right to choose who rules them

David Cameron today said Argentina 
should be 'in no doubt that Britain will defend the Falkland Islands 
properly' against any threat to its people's right to choose who is 
their ruler.

The Prime Minister spoke after 
Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said she would make a
 formal complaint to the United Nations over the disputed archipelago.

It
 also came as the islands' Penguin News enraged Argentina by calling its
 leader a 'bitch' on its website, by using the insult as a file name on a
 photograph of her.

The paper's editor Lisa Watson quickly 
received a torrent of complaints and abuse from Argentines on Twitter 
and in its daily newspaper La Nacion before it was removed.

Mistake: Penguin News editor Lisa Watson was alerted to the insult via Twitter, and promptly removed it

Lisa Watson, who edits the weekly 
Penguin News paper which is sold to the 3,000 islanders, was alerted to 
the online insult by an Argentinian.

She said it had been placed there by a colleague with 'dry humour' and it was soon removed.

She
 also revealed she regularly receives abusive messages and said: 'I 
receive threats and insults via our work email address and on Twitter.

'The
 threats I try not to take seriously, particularly as the individuals 
tend to sign their name and even offer 'besos' (kisses) after claiming 
they are coming to the Falklands and their first task will be to kill 
me.

'Mainly I am referred to as a prostitute, liar, thief and pirate, other words I really wouldn't like to mention.'

Tensions between Argentina and 
Britain have risen as Buenos Aires revives its long-standing claim to 
sovereignty over the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas.

It is almost 30 years since the 1982 war between the countries approaches.

Speaking
 during a visit to Sweden, Mr Cameron said he had no doubt that the UN 
would back the islands' status as a self-governing British overseas 
territory.

He said: 'I 
think Argentina will find, when she goes to the United Nations, that it 
is absolutely a part of the UN charter to support self-determination and
 the people of the Falkland Islands want to maintain their status, their
 connection to the UK.

'What we've said is absolutely clear 
and right under the UN, which is to say that as long as the people of 
the Falkland Islands want to maintain that status, we will make sure 
they do and we will defend the Falkland Islands properly to make sure 
that's the case.'

He said the UK Government's stance 'should not leave anyone in any doubt about our support' for the Falklanders.

Ms Kirchner used a speech to Falklands War veterans on Tuesday to accuse Britain of 'militarising' the south Atlantic.

She
 cited the recent posting of the Duke of Cambridge to the Falklands as 
an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot, along with the announcement 
that the modern warship HMS Dauntless is to be sent to the region to 
replace the frigate HMS Montrose.

Ms Kirchner said it was difficult to 
see how 'the sending of an immense and modern destroyer accompanied by 
the royal heir, who we would have liked to see in civilian clothes and 
not in military uniform' was not a show of purposeful military strength 
by the UK.

She said: 'I 
have instructed our chancellor to present formally to the Security 
Council of the United Nations and before the General Assembly of the 
United Nations this militarisation of the south Atlantic which implies a
 great risk for international security.'

Downing Street yesterday said it was a matter for Argentina what issues it wishes to raise at the UN.

A spokeswoman said: 'The people of the Falklands choose to be British. Their right to self-determination is a principle enshrined in the UN charter.

'The Falklands are already discussed by a UN committee and it is up to the Argentines to decide whether they are going to raise it at the UN.

'The fact is that one of the key principles of the UN charter is self-determination. That is what we are talking about in relation to the Falkland Islands.'
