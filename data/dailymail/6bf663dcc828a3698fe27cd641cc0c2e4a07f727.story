The number of parents being fined for taking their children on holiday during term-time has soared by nearly 70 per cent in the past year.

Some 63,837 penalties were issued to mums and dads in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months.

Many of the fines by local authorities were for truancy or repeated poor attendance, but the majority were for letting children skip lessons because of holiday, the BBC said.

Having fun: But the number of fines to parents taking their children on term-time breaks has soared by 70%

The news follows Government rules which were introduced last September under which parents who take their children on term-time holiday breaks are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence from school. 

The fine rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

Parents in Lancashire received the highest number of fines as they increased by 176 per cent to 3,106 in the year to July, followed by Kent where local authorities issued 2,973 fines, although this was just 3 per cent higher than the previous year.

Other offenders were parents in Leicester, with 2,728 fines, West Sussex, with 2,403 fines and Luton with 2,249.

The research, which collected replies from 118 councils out of a total of 152 in England, also showed that parents in Oldham, Manchester, East Sussex, East Riding of Yorkshire and Doncaster also made it in the top 10 most fined.

Under the new rules, head teachers are no longer allowed to grant 10 days of holiday during term time under ‘special circumstances’.

1. Lancashire, 3,106 (1,125 in 2012-13); up 176 per cent.

2. Kent,2,973 (2,868 in 2012-13;) up three per cent.

3 Leicester,2,728 (2,726 in 2012-13); no change.

4. West Sussex,2,403 (973 in 2012-13); up 146 per cent.

5. Luton,2,249 (1,395 in 2012-13); up 61 per cent.

6. Oldham, 2,022 (1,190 in 2012-13); up 69 per cent.

7. Manchester, 1,911 (1,234 in 2012-13); up 54 per cent.

8. East Sussex, 1,756 (1,237 in 2012-13); up 41 per cent.

9.East Riding of Yorkshire, 1,594 (1,066 in 2012-13); up 49 per cent.

10. Doncaster, 1,464 (630 in 2012-13); up 132 per cent.

The new rules received an angry backlash by parents complaining that going away with their children during school holiday time was becoming increasingly expensive.

Parents Stewart and Natasha Sutherland, 39, from Telford, Shropshire, are refusing to pay 
fines after taking their three children to Rhodes in October 2012 during
 the school term.

They risk being jailed after failing to pay up.

Mr
 Sutherland, who says he and his wife work shifts and find it hard to 
get time off, said: ‘Once the regulations came into force, it became 
just a block ban, rather than schools and local councils considering 
each case individually.

‘It's now becoming the case that family holidays are just for the rich 
because so many working people either can't afford it or can't get the 
time off outside school terms.

‘Family holidays are just as important to children as school. A happy child will get their work done better.’

At school rather than on holiday: Schools minister Nick Gibb said that as a result of the new rules introduced in September, 130,000 fewer pupils were regularly missing lessons

Schools minister Nick Gibb said that, because of the Government's attitude, fewer pupils are now missing lessons.

He said the government's policy had been based on research showing regularly missing lessons can damage pupils' chances of achieving good qualifications.

He added: ‘As a result of the changes we have implemented, 130,000 fewer pupils are regularly missing lessons, which means 130,000 more pupils getting the chance of a good education that prepares them for life in modern Britain.

‘We do understand the concerns of parents, however, and are introducing new rules to give all schools the power to choose their own term dates.

‘One benefit of this may be that teachers, pupils and parents are able to take holidays outside of current peak periods.

’We hope parents and schools will make good use of this new freedom.’
