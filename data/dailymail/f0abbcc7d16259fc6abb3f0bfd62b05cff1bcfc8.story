Angry: Star of AMC's Breaking Bad, Dean Norris, pictured, has hurled a barrage of Twitter abuse at Delta

Star of AMC's Breaking Bad, Dean Norris, has hurled a barrage of Twitter abuse at Delta Air Lines after he was delayed twice in three days.

Norris called the airline a 's*** hole' and a 'horses*** company' in the same outraged tweet yesterday, complaining that his plane was taking off later than scheduled after an air hostess called in sick.

'Back on s*** hole Delta 2nd flight 3 days delayed cause missing flight attendant!!!what a horses*** company hub system=no choice=f***ed' the angry tweet read.

Yesterday's tweet was even slightly more furious than his original attack on the airline.

On Saturday, Norris, who plays Hank Schrader in the hit TV show, Walter White's brother-in-law, was incensed by how much Delta apparently 'sucks.'

'Delta airlines SUCKS. wish I had a more intense word for suck to describe how much they SUCK. Southwest kicks your ass! #delta #f***delta' the tweet read.

After the rant, Norris' fans chimed in.

The actor retweeted @KCBrackley declaration that 'Delta stands for "don't ever leave the airport"'

Delta, staff obviously concerned about the reputation damage such a public rage could inflict, were quick to slip into damage control gear.

The airline apologized to Norris on 
the micro-blogging website, tweeting: 'I'm terribly sorry for your 
travel experience. Pls follow and DM your confirmation number. I'd like 
to make things right.'

Friends? Norris later tweeted: 'Just kidding. LOVE DELTA. Please don't spit in my drinks,' with this photo of him smiling with flight attendants

And perhaps the peace offering did the trick.

Norris later tweeted: 'Just kidding. LOVE DELTA. Please don't spit in my drinks,' with a photo of him smiling with flight attendants.

Or maybe he literally just doesn't want them to spit in his drinks.
