Female MPs are well used to scrutiny over their appearance - whether it be Theresa May's choice of footwear or Louise Mensch's facelift.

But it seems women are not the only ones turning for style and beauty help, as the number of 'male peacock' politicians is on the rise.

Westminster men are increasingly turning to make-up artists for help under the unforgiving studio lights and using professional trainers to try and avoid negative headlines about their waistlines, say insiders.

Sky News political correspondent Sophy Ridge says David Cameron backcombs his hair to hide his bald spot

Sky News political correspondent Sophy Ridge says grooming among male politicians is 'the fastest trend in Westminster'.

It comes after reports that David Cameron is worried about his bald patch and Nick Clegg is concerned with his paunch.

Opposition MPs are also said to be more conscious of their looks and Ed Miliband has faced accusations of covering up his grey hair.

Ms Ridge said rolling 24-hour news, HD cameras and bright studio lights is fuelling the trend.

She claims the best politicians' aides regularly use make-up to hide the shine on television.

On the Telegraph website, she wrote: 'Now even the most macho of male politicos, from Ed Balls to trade union leaders, aren’t brave enough to face the cameras without at least a slick of anti-shine.'

Nick Clegg allegedly installed a running machine in the Cabinet Office after negative headlines about his paunch

The Prime Minister also debuted his new glasses last month.

Mr Cameron's wife Samantha is believed to have helped him pick out the rimless style, which have drawn comparisons to the ones worn by Tony Blair.

Mr Cameron has previously generated headlines - and raised eyebrows - with his intense workouts with Naomi Campbell's personal trainer.

The Prime Minister has regularly undertaken gruelling training sessions with Matt Roberts, who has also helped keep Amanda Holden in shape.

However hiding a bald patch is harder than battling the bulge.

The Prime Minister has taken to growing his hair long or backcombing to try and mask the bald spot, according to Ms Ridge.

Weight is also said to be an issue for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

In May, he cut a fuller figure as he 
appeared to be losing the battle with his middle-aged spread, but after a
raft of negative headlines, he was noticeably slimmer at the Liberal 
Democrat Party conference.

Ms Ridge said Michael Gove is the 'extreme example' of a male peacock. The education secretary (pictured left in 2012 and right at the Conservative Party Conference last month) spent £2,500 a week at an Austrian fat farm

Ms Ridge said Mr Clegg installed a running machine for the Cabinet Office in a bid to stay trim.

However, Michael Gove wins the award for the most 'extreme' example of a male peacock, Ms Ridge says.

In September, the Mail on Sunday reported the Education Secretary paid £2,500 a week to lose 2st at an Austrian 'fat farm'.

There have been rumours that Mr Gove's motivation was his desire to mount a leadership challenge when Mr Cameron eventually steps down.

However, Mr Gove dismissed the speculation, saying he is 'too ugly'.

Ms Ridge said far from being a problem, more focus on the appearance of politicians is 'common sense'.

She wrote that politicians 'have to play the game' and if MPs are too shiny or wearing appalling clothes then voters are too distracted by their appearance to listen to what they have to say.
