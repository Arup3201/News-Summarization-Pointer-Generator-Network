Arizona Cardinal's defensive tackle Darnell Dockett is known for his entertaining and colorful tweets on Twitter -- now he's known for someone else's. 

On Wednesday, Dockett liked a tweet by business mogul Donald trump, I mean he really liked it. 

So much so that he bypassed the commonly used 'retweet' button and copy and pasted, not one, but two of Trump's tweets to his 180,000 followers. 

Copy/paste: Arizona Cardinal defensive tackle Darnell Docket copied Donald Trump's tweet down to the punctuation

Again: Dockett tweeted another one of Trump's tweets just minutes after tweeting the first, this time he included the hashtag 'EBOLA'

Trump tweeted about the new ABC show 'Black-ish':

'How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled "Blackish"? Can you imagine the furor of a show, "Whiteish"! Racism at highest level?'

Just hours after Trump tweeted his views, Dockett tweeted the exact same thing, down to the punctuation.

Coincidence? Most likely not. 

Not amused: Trump tweeted an article chronicling the incident saying that he was plagiarized

Just one minute later, the defensive tackle struck again. He tweeted one of Trump's tweets about the Ebola outbreak. But, this time, he added a hashtag to his copy-paste technique:

'Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately! #EBOLA'

Trump wasn't flattered by Dockett's promotion of his views.

Instead, Trump tweeted an article chronicling the plagiarism and followed it with the phrase 'I was playgiarised' -- yes, that is how he spelled the word. 

However, Trump wasn't too upset, in his next tweet, just two minutes later, Trump tweeted the article again, but this time he included the statement 'I will not sue Darnell.'

Good news for the football player. 

Both Dockett and Trump are known for stirring the pot on Twitter. Dockett came under fire in June when he tweeted controversial pro-O.J. Simpson comments.

Trump is not new to tweet-induced criticism either. Trump tweets multiple times per day about national issues and the government. 

Trump has been criticized for tweets about autism, the Ebola outbreak, and President Obama.  

Law suit: Trump tweeted that he would not sue Dockett for the plagiarism of his tweets

Twitter: Dockett received criticism in June for his controversial pro-O.J. Simpson tweets 

Followers: Many Twitter users commented on the alleged plagiarism
