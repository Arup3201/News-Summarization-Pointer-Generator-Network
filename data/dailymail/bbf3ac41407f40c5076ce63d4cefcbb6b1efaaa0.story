Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock has been fined £9,000 by the Football Association following post-match comments about referee Craig Pawson after the 2-1 home Barclays Premier League defeat by Chelsea on October 18.

The Eagles boss, 65, had said referee Craig Pawson was 'influenced' by Chelsea players in the decision to send off Damien Delaney for a second yellow card.

Warnock denied the charge and had requested a personal hearing, which was held on Wednesday.

Speaking ahead of Palace's match against Sunderland, Warnock accepted he would have to change the way he handled himself in the media.

'I don't think I can change the way things are. I have to change myself,' said Warnock, who would go on to lament some decisions he felt went against his side in the subsequent defeat by the Black Cats on Monday night.

'At the moment I have to change to adhere to instructions that are currently with the Premier League. Whether that is detrimental to the press or not, I don't know, but I have to change - they are not going to change for me.'
