The energy watchdog wants to cut the 'baffling' array of tariffs currently on the market

Householders face continued confusion over energy bills after watchdog Ofgem announced proposals that watered down David Cameron’s promise to compel companies by law to put customers on the cheapest deals.

The power regulator said gas and electricity firms would merely be forced to inform bill payers about the best deals, even if offered by a rival company.

It also wants suppliers to offer four tariffs instead of the 558 deals currently available, in an effort to tackle soaring bills that now average £1,300 a year for dual-fuel users.

Number Ten yesterday played down the differences between Ofgem’s plan and what the Prime Minister told the Commons on Wednesday.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Their proposals will help make bills simpler and easier for consumers. This is complementary with what we are trying to achieve. It is really the same agenda.

‘The Energy Bill will be published in due course and we will take into account the Ofgem proposals.’

Ofgem
said it would look at the Prime Minister’s proposals when they were 
published in full, but communications director Ian Marlee said: ‘We 
still think that competition is the best way to protect consumers in the
market’.

However, Joe 
Malinowski, of price comparison website TheEnergyShop.com, said: ‘The 
logical conclusion of everyone coming on to one standard tariff is that 
there will be losers as well as winners – some people will see their 
bills go up.’

He said the one in four customers who currently shop around for deals save up to £190 a year.

Mr Cameron insisted he wants to be 'on the side of hard-working families'

They could see their bills go up by just over £100 while most of those on standard tariffs would see theirs fall by £34.

Energy
firms were left baffled by Ofgem’s plans.

Angela Knight, the chief 
executive of Energy UK, which represents major suppliers, said: ‘What 
they have here is a pretty challenging set of requirements on the 
companies and we will work with Ofgem and others, once we have got the 
detail, to get what is in the best interests of our customers.’

The Prime Minister’s announcement caught out his ministers, with Energy Secretary Ed Davey distancing himself from the proposal.

However,
Mr Davey welcomed Ofgem’s plan: ‘These are the sort of measures I have 
been urging for some time.

'They represent a big step forwards in 
reforming our energy market.’
