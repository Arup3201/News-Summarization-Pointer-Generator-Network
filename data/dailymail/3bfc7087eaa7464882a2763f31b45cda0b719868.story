CBS paid tribute to veteran correspondent Bob Simon on Sunday night with a special hour-long episode which celebrated his life and career

CBS paid tribute to veteran correspondent Bob Simon last night with a special hour-long episode which celebrated his life and career.

Presented by Steve Kroft, the special 60 Minutes Presents charted   Simon's 47-year career presenting from war zones and disasters across the world.

The veteran reporter was killed in a car crash in New York City 12 days ago.

On the show Simon was remembered for having travelled to more than 130 different countries to report on every possible type of news.

'It was his love of adventure and the search for new experiences that drove him to explore exotic and often dangerous places,' Kroft said.

Simon, 73, who survived being held in an Iraqi prison under the regime of Saddam Hussein and was one of the last reporters to leave Saigon during the Vietnam War, died following the crash on Manhattan's West Side Highway. 

Kroft said: 'Tonight, we remember and celebrate the life and extraordinary career of our friend and colleague Bob Simon. 

'He spent 47 years covering the world for CBS News and 60 Minutes and survived dozens of wars and other calamities. 

'He died 11 days ago in a New York City traffic accident not far from this studio. 

'The irony would not have been lost on Bob. Irony was one of his favorite journalistic devices. 

'He was a brilliant combination of sophistication and street smarts, who liked to tell people he was just a Jewish kid from the Bronx. 

'He didn't tell you that he was also Phi Beta Kappa, and had been a Fulbright scholar, or that he came to become television's quintessential foreign correspondent.'

The show looked at three of Simon's most memorable stories: The Shame of Srebrenica, which looked at the slaughter by Serb troops of more than 8,000 Muslim civilians in that Bosnian town and the role of Dutch U.N Peacekeepers; The Sea Gypsies, about a small community who survived the 2004 Asian Tsunami; and The Recyclers, about a town built on a rubbish dump in Paraguay.

Colleague Lesley Stahl said: 'It wasn't an easy choice to pick only three, given the hundreds of stories he did, and the range of subjects he took on. 

'He combined bravery, an eye for the telling detail and, at times, a righteous indignation at war's folly and its consequences.' 

Scott Pelley said: 'Bob Simon was always ready for an adventure - a chance to travel somewhere he'd never seen and tell us all about it. 

'He had a gift for finding the surprising, even the magical, in the most unexpected places.'

Simon was born on May 29, 1941, in the Bronx, New York City, and graduated from Brandeis University in 1962, receiving a degree in history.

He started his 47-year career with CBS News in 1967.

Two years later, Simon joined the network's foreign bureaus, where he was until 1981 when he became the State Department correspondent. 

He went on to report from war zones in Portugal, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, the Persian Gulf, and Yugoslavia. He covered the conflict in Northern Ireland and U.S. military actions in Grenada, Somalia and Haiti.

Simon was described by his 60 Minutes producer as a 'reporter's reporter' and his coverage and insight into some of the world's most hostile regions brought numerous accolades including 27 Emmys and four Peabody Awards.

Simon joined CBS News as a reporter and assignment editor, covering campus unrest and inner-city riots.

He also worked in CBS' Tel Aviv bureau from 1977 to 1981 and in Washington, D.C., as its Department of State correspondent.

He got his start as a globe-trotting war correspondent in Vietnam. During one broadcast from the war zone, Simon reported from the back of a helicopter on its way to collect an American with shrapnel wounds.

He covered the length of the Vietnam War and was on one of last helicopters out of Saigon in 1975 when the U.S. withdrew troops.

In 1987, he was made chief Middle East correspondent for CBS News.

At the beginning of the Persian-Gulf war in January 1991, he was captured with colleagues by Iraqi forces.

The team spent 40 days in a prison of Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein.

He was interrogated, beaten with canes and truncheons, and starved by his Iraqi captors. He would later recount his story in the book Forty Days.

Following his ordeal, he returned to Iraq in January 1993 to cover the U.S. bombing of the country.

Simon won numerous awards, including his fourth Peabody and an Emmy for his story from Central Africa on the world's only all-black symphony in 2012.

Another story about an orchestra in Paraguay, one whose poor members constructed their instruments from trash, won him his 27th Emmy, perhaps the most held by a journalist for field reporting, CBS said.

He also won the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, for 'Shame of Srebrenica,' a '60 Minutes II' report on genocide during the Bosnian War.

His range was broad - from reporting on the Lost Boys of Sudan during the 1987 civil war to more recently, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster which was hit by a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 earthquake.

'It's a terrible loss for all of us at CBS News,' said 60 Minutes Executive Producer Jeff Fager. 'It is such a tragedy made worse because we lost him in a car accident, a man who has escaped more difficult situations than almost any journalist in modern times.'

'Bob was a reporter's reporter. He was driven by a natural curiosity that took him all over the world covering every kind of story imaginable.'

Bill Whitaker added: 'Bob Simon's great passion - apart from his family and good writing - was music. 

'He delighted particularly in opera, but a symphony in Kinshasa, a young conductor in Caracas or a rap star from Brooklyn were all worthy of Bob's attention, and in his judgment, ours.'

Simon’s final reporting piece for CBS was a collaboration between him and his daughter, Tanya, who also works for the network. It was about Ebola and aired last Sunday.
