Parents are increasingly dipping into their savings to fund their daughters freezing their eggs, one of Britain’s leading fertility experts have said.

As a growing number of women are prioritising financial stability and a fulfilling career over starting a family, parents fear that they may never become grandparents.

The overwhelming desire for a second round of pitter-patter of tiny feet has led to a ‘cultural shift’ in the attitude towards the full range of fertility treatments among the older generation.

Happy families: The number of parents who fund fertility treatments such as freezing eggs and IVF for their daughters has increased in the past five years

‘We are seeing a real social change,’ Dr Professor Dr Geeta Nargund, Medical Director of Create Fertility Clinics, and an NHS consultant told The Telegraph.

‘Five years ago it was almost unheard of for patients to have their parents funding their IVF treatment or grandparents funding fertility treatment but now we receive a lot of inquiries.

‘I run frequent open days, the room takes anywhere between 16 and 20 couples in London and you tend to have at least two of three where parents come with their daughters now – that never happened before.’

A 2011 study found that parents spend more than £43,000 on their adult children until they turn 30.

The most common subsidies are university fees, rent, house deposits and weddings.

Social change: Desire to become grandparents see many pay for their child's fertility treatment

One in five parents now help their children to buy their first home, handing them an average of £23,000 each, a survey published last month has found.

One in four of those had to cut back on their own day-to-day spending to contribute to their child’s deposit, and 20 per cent dipped into funds saved up for their retirement and for elderly care fees.

Longstanding traditions in many cultures see the bride’s family pay for a wedding ceremony, but with more and more women putting off getting married in order to first establish financial stability or choosing to have children before getting hitched, parents increasingly pay for fertility treatment instead.

Doctors say that this is down to a desire to become grandparents that is so strong that they would rather pay for their daughter to freeze her eggs than risk it never happening.

This comes after doctors warned that it is ten times harder for a woman to become pregnant at 43 than at 37. 

The rapid speeding up of a woman’s biological clock means that by the time she is 43, she will need to go through 44 eggs on average to produce just one normal embryo. At 37 she needs just 4.4, on average.

A woman typically produces one egg a month, so this means it will take her almost four years to conceive – rather than only four months.

Researcher Meredith Brower said that the number of eggs needed for a viable pregnancy rises ‘almost exponentially’ after 42, and urged women to freeze their eggs without delay.

British experts said that while, ideally, women would have their babies in their twenties, the realities of modern life mean many have no choice but to wait.

Education, careers, lack of money and the hunt for ‘Mr Right’ are all causing women to put motherhood on the back burner.

Nearly half of all British babies are now born to women aged 30 and older, and the number born to women in their late thirties has almost trebled in recent years.

Controversially, internet companies Facebook and Apple are offering to pay female employees to freeze their eggs. 

The ‘perk’ – at the moment for employees in the US only – is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life.
