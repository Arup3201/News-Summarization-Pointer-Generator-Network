The fear of sexual attack for women in India has become so prevalent it has inspired the country's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims.

And the techniques are known to work... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker.

Years before becoming a champion boxer, Mary Kom, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics representing her native India, had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver.

Recalling her escape, she said: 'I remember I went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress. I was 18 years old and looked very ladylike.

'The rikshaw driver wanted to do bad things. We were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted.'

But, re-enacting the powerful punches she used to protect herself as she spoke, Kom added: 'Boom, boom, boom... he was on the ground - finished.'

Standing just 5ft 2in, Kom is a far from intimidating figure. But her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of India as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women.

In partnership with mobile phone network Vodafone, she has developed an app that will launch later this year, offering basic self-defence tips for women as well as advice and support.

The app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker, with techniques that are simple for anyone to use: From punches and kicks, to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes.

A basic version for regular mobile phones rather than smartphones will also become available, giving advice and instruction in text form.

But the aim is not just to prepare women physically. What Kom hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves, even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street.

Women and girls of all ages will be able to benefit from the training and advice given through the app

'The app teaches basic things for people who have not done [boxing] before. If it is too hard for them, it will not interest them.

'Hopefully, if they are interested, they will continue to learn.'

The techniques taught are basic. But they could mean the difference between life or death.

Indians have become hardened to news of rape in their country, but that all changed in 2012 with a gang-rape on a bus that shocked the world and left its victim to die from horribly inflicted injuries.

The attack forced the country's government to show it was prepared to tackle the problem, with faster prosecutions and tougher sentences. But only as recently as October, a woman was twice gang-raped before being burned alive - allegedly by gangsters with connections to police and politicians.

Part of the problem is India's women continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens. It is a social prejudice Kom has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural Kangathei.

Women take to the streets to protest in Calcutta after a gang-rape last October, after which the victim was burned alive for reporting the crime to police

'When I was a little girl I was always playing fighting games. I was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me.

'People try to discourage what women do. I began my sports career to help my father financially but people say "you are a girl, you can't do this" or "you are a woman you must do this". I want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it, they can do it.

'I was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but I would not let it get to me.'

The app is just part of Kom's attempts to help women through boxing, having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of Manipur.

The club is funded by Vodafone and its new 'Firsts' programme, which supports and encourages first time experiences.
