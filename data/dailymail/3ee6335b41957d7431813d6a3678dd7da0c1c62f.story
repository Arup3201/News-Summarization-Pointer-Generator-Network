Three Chinese lawmakers have been given heavy fines after one of the eight illegal Siberian tigers they kept as pets fell to its death from the roof of a 11-storey apartment building.

The seven-month-old cub was seen falling from the tower block in the city of Pingdu in eastern China's Shandong province by residents watching a Chinese New Year firework display.

Two of the animals - which cannot legally be kept as pets in China - were being temporarily housed on the roof of the building by local businessman Yang Wenzheng, who claimed he was looking after the tigers for a friend who could no longer afford to keep them at his mountain park.

Mr Yang admitted keeping the two Siberian tigers on the roof of the building to help his friend Cui Jinguang, who was struggling to meet the cost of looking after the animals at his mountain park.

As well as the adult and cub given to Mr Yang, Mr Cui also kept an adult and cub for himself. 

Another friend, named by the South China Morning Post as forestry worker Cui Jinguang, was given a third adult tiger and three cubs to look after.

The death of the tiger cub in Pingdu saw police launch an investigation in to where the animals had come from, which eventually led to the conviction of the three men, who are all members of the city's People's Congress. 

Each of the men was subsequently fined 3,000 yuan (£330), according to local media reports.

Shocked neighbour Hui Tang, 33, who lives on the third floor said: 'My husband and I were standing at the window when we saw this object go flying past.

'When we looked down to see what it was we couldn't believe it when we saw that it was a tiger.

'At first we thought it was a toy, but then we saw blood coming from its mouth... We were completely shocked as we couldn't work out how a tiger had got onto the roof.'

A police spokesman said: 'the man had signed a contract with the park last year to temporarily foster two tiger cubs.

'He kept them on the roof in a cage because his apartment was too small... On the night of the accident, it seems the cub was so scared of the fireworks it forced its way out and tried to get away, blindly running over the top.

These tigers are listed as a Class I protected species in China, and only those who are fully licenced can breed or raise them.
