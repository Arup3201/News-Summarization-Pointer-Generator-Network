Luis Suarez’s future at Liverpool took a twist when his father-in-law declared the time is right for him to leave the club.

Barcelona and Real Madrid will both make bids for Suarez this summer but so far none have been received by Liverpool who still hope they can keep him at Anfield.

Yet Gustavo Balbi, the father of Suarez’s wife Sofia, who lives near Barcelona in Castelldefels, told Spanish TV show La Sexta: ‘This is the right moment for him to move. He has shown all that he is. He has nothing else to prove there [in England]. If he leaves the  Premier League, his best option would be to come here to Spain.

‘In Liverpool he is very loved and respected, so he would not go to another English team out of respect for the fans. We would like him here, to have the grandkids here in Spain. I am convinced he would do well if he came here.’

La Sexta claims that Suarez is unhappy with manager Brendan Rodgers for saying the team did not miss him at the start of last season but this has not been relayed by Suarez or his representatives.

Liverpool have enquired about the availability of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, who the Catalans are willing to sell, but a part-exchange deal involving Suarez has not been discussed.

Barcelona believe that Suarez has privately taken the decision to leave Liverpool this summer and the comments he made following Uruguay’s defeat of England have given them and Real Madrid encouragement.
