A job hunter has tasted sweet success in the employment market thanks to his unique CV made to look like a chocolate bar label.

Nick Begley, from New York, sent in his 'resume bar' as an application for 12 jobs with his skills printed under the 'ingredients' section of the wrapper.

The 32-year-old also replaced the nutritional information with boasts about his skills, including a 100 per cent daily value in qualities such as motivation, leadership and creativity and 110 per cent for his work ethic.

Sweet: Nick Begley, of New York, landed the job using this chocolate bar CV

He sold himself on the bar as an 'experienced marketing professional' with a serving size of '1 career' and used the tagline 'Credentials that will satisfy any organization’s appetite'.

The labels were subsequently wrapped around 12 bars and sent off to prospective employers after he completed his MBA at the University of Central Florida in 2009.

This week, his friend, Eli Langer, posted a photo of the bar on Reddit, where it has received more than 3,200 comments.

The approach has worked for Mr Begley twice in three months - one time to earn an internship and the other to secure a marketing job with LeagueApps, a platform that connects adult recreational athletes.

Mr Begley told ABC News: 'People are either going to love or hate it.

'My focus was to find an organisation that would embrace it, because if they weren't open to that kind of out-of-the-box thinking, that wouldn't be a company that I would fit in well with anyways.'

Instead of waiting in line for a job, Nick Begley took matters into his own hands and created a unique CV

Mr Begley had already found an organisation, the Orlando Magic basketball franchise, that embraced his creativity while in graduate school.

The team hired him for a summer internship after receiving a 'ResumeBar,' which gave Mr Begley all the confidence he needed to try it again.

Mr Begley, who also once had his resume delivered along with a pizza, said his brother, Jeremy, designed the label for him and he had it printed at Kinko’s.

He put the label on top of a standard Nestle Crunch bar, making his resume not-so-ordinary for less than $2.50 per bar.

'Of course,' Mr Begley said when asked by ABC News if it was worth it. 'It was creative and put me ahead [with potential employers] as far as understanding that I was willing to go the extra mile.'

Mr Begley now works for a Toronto-based e-commerce entertainment company, a job he found the old-fashioned way.

'I was recruited by someone I used to work with,' he said.
