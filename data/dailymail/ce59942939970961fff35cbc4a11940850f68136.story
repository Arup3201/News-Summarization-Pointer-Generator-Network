Sex scandal: Rotherham Council already faces a group legal action by 15 abuse victims from the town but the firm representing them  

The victims of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could be paid up to £140million in compensation, the solicitor representing them revealed today.

South Yorkshire law firm  Switalskis is working on behalf of 15 women who were raped and sexually exploited over a 16 year period and are seeking at least £100,000 from the council for each victim.

As children they were among 1,400 victims habitually abused by  men in the town – almost all of them of Pakistani origin - because the council and police turned a blind eye to their plight.

Switalskis' head of child abuse, David Greenwood, told MailOnline today that after yesterday's damning report the authorities have a 'duty' to offer compensation to each of the 1,400 victims identified. 

The council and police have admitted 'systemic failures' allowed predators to abuse on an 'industrial' scale and are certain to face a bill for millions of pounds in compensation.

The cash could come from the local authority's reserves, from borrowing or the sale of assets.

This would leave Rotherham Council with a potential bill of approaching £140million, which would be paid out because many victims have been unable to work because of their ordeal.

Mr Greenwood said that recently Rochdale Council, another local authority who failed to cope with paedophile rings in their area, recently paid out £115,000 to a victim. 

'We represent 15 women who suffered abuse in Rotherham and two more have contacted us in the 24 hours since the report was released.

'It is important to remember that at the time of the abuse they were children under the age of 16 and could not legally consent.

'The council are aware of them and we are at the stage where we would like to agree compensation settlements with them. If this fails then we will go to court.

'Rotherham Council and South Yorkshire Police missed clear opportunities to prevent the sexual exploitation of dozens of girls in Rotherham.

'This is an extraordinary case but Rochdale recently settled for £115,000 with one victim, I would say on average we would be looking for £100,000 each.

'If it is found that in other cases the council held information that could have prevented abuse they would also be liable'.

Legal battle: Should Rotherham Council settle with victims it could be faced with a bill of up to £140million 

'They have suffered horrific abuse but they are part of a wider group. The council has a duty to use the information now in its hands to find them and agree settlements'. 

If the council agreed to pay compensation to every victim it would be left with a huge bill.

Birmingham City Council admitted in 2012 it may have to sell landmarks like the NEC centre to cover up to £1billion in legal claims over equal pay.

Thousands of women were found to be paid less than others, mainly men, who did the same or equivalent jobs, and won their case in court as part of a huge group action.

If Rotherham Council  faced similar problems they may be forced to sell buildings and land.

MailOnline has approached them for a comment.
