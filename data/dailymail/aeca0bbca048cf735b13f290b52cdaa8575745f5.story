Oscar Pistorius took acting lessons before standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a South African journalist has claimed in an open letter to the so-called 'Blade Runner'.

British-born columnist Jani Allan says Pistorius had been tutored by one of her 'close friends' before taking the stand in Pretoria, continuing that the paralympian was a 'faux hero' who has 'betrayed people and disappointed his fans.'

Allan's letter
 reads: 'I have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting 
lessons for your days in court. Your coach has an impossible task.'

'Oscar, I look at you mewling and puking in the witness stand. You truly represent everything that the West loathes about white South Africans who live extravagant lives in their expensive laagers.'

Asked about her letter, she told The Sunday People: 'I have this information from extremely reliable sources.'

She also compares Pistorius to Eugene Terre'Blanche, who served three years in prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996.

She said of him: 'Terre’blanche was cut from the same cloth as you, Oscar.

'He was given to boasting, vain in all things, narcissistic in the extreme and flying into terrible rages when things didn’t go his way. I suspect this description fits you.'

The Paralympic superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial.

Reeva's mother June Steenkamp has also accused the South African of acting out, referring to moments he has wept uncontrollable while sitting in the dock.

In the early stages of his trial Dr Denise Bjerkman analysed his body language.

She said: 'Oscar has to project a complex image of innocence and grief to the mass media and court.

'His squeaky clean image 
comes natural to him with his short hair, relaxed wide-eyed response in 
social interaction and charming smile.

'What Oscar has to juggle in court is his 
three public personas: the boyish wonder he stage-managed for the global
 media – who will challenge any obstacle and which refutes his 
disability; the humble, controlled, grieving Oscar for public 
consumption in the courts and the suave flash Harry, fast cars, gung-ho 
image of Oscar with adoring women draped on his arm.

'His dramatic, tearful breakdown in 
court - when the brutal wounds on Reeva’s Steenkamp’s body were 
discussed - is more likely to be conveniently staged.

I believe such behaviour serves to hide his feelings of sickening guilt and vulnerability.'

Pistorius admits shooting 29-year-old Reeva on Valentine's Day last year but denies premeditated murder and two counts related to shooting a gun.

The trail continues on May 5.

Acting? On many occasions throughout the trial he has been seen cowering in the dock with heads in his hand
