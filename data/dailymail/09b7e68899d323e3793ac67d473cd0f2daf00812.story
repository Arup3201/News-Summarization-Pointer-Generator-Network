Roy Hodgson was offered the option to recall Chelsea captain

England boss declined chance for Terry's international return

On the journey home, as he reflected on what had proved to be Italy’s winning goal, one wonders whether Roy Hodgson recalled a conversation he had with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke in the build-up to this World Cup.

As reports of John Terry’s exceptional form for Chelsea grew more consistent and insistent, Dyke approached his manager and gave him an option.

If he wanted to attempt to persuade Terry (right) out of international retirement, the chairman said, he would make it happen. It was a well-intentioned gesture.

Dyke would have known the controversial nature of such a call and the criticism of his organisation that would undoubtedly follow — but he did not want Hodgson’s chances of success weakened, by what remains a collision between Terry and the governing body.

Hodgson declined the offer. Whether he thought Terry’s baggage would be more trouble than it was worth, or simply felt a sense of loyalty to Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka, the central defenders who had got him to Brazil, we may never know — but the invitation went no further than that discussion.

If, however, Hodgson believed Terry’s inclusion carried an imbalance of risk-reward, he was mistaken.

Terry remains the finest organiser of a defence in the English game.

There is no guarantee that England would have held out in Manaus had he been in the team — but they did against Italy the last time, and there would be greater confidence about the reckoning with Uruguay and Luis Suarez in Sao Paulo if Terry were playing.

Still, we lie on the bed we have made now.
