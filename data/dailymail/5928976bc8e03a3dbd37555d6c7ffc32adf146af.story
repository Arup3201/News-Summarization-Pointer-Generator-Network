You should never embarrass your mates to get in with a girl. It's one of the golden rules of the brotherhood.

The un-written rule, the sacrosanct tenet of the fraternity but  I sort-of broke the rule this week but I've got to say it was worth it when I got on over on Jamie Biscuits (my father's nickname for Laing, heir to the McVitie's biscuit empire).

We were at a rather swanky pool party at the Dream hotel in Downtown, West 16th Street.

So fancy: Spencer was joined by Jamie and Emma Miller at a swanky pool party at the Dream Hotel

Lots of New York socialites sitting round the pool looking uber cool.

Everyone was subtly checking each other out and I was sat on a sun-lounger with the lovely Emma Miller and Jamie perched perilously close to the edge.

I moved my hand over to Jamie's shoulder barely concealing the fact I was already cracking up with laughter.

Applied a bit of pressure – but he still hadn't worked out my cunning plan.

Spencer couldn't help but give Jamie a dunking as he perched temptingly close to the pool's edge

Cracking up: Spencer had uncontrollable belly laughs as Jamie landed head first in the pool

Drying off: Spencer said that Jamie saw the funny side of his prank (eventually)

Then push came to shove and my blond chum flipped off his lounger and straight into the pool in the most dramatic fashion possible.

I could see quite a few of the other guests stifling a laugh but I was in fits. Uncontrollable belly laughs. Ms Miller was also amused.

Luckily Jamie is one of the easiest going blokes in the world and he saw the funny side – and it gave him the opportunity to show off his new buff physique as he took off his soaking wet clothes. (Clearly his new work out regime with the MyCloudTag fitness app and my Forza T5 Super Strength tablets is working.) 

Spencer described the rave as a 'friendly riot'

Mates: Spencer made a few new friends at the party in Queens

Friends again: Jamie appeared to have forgiven Spencer for his pool prank

Later in the week we got a taste of what I imagine an Acid House rave was like. Clearly I'm far too young to have experienced this myself, I was born in 1989, the year after the second summer of love so all I know of that era of youth culture is from grey-haired former ravers who bang on about those halcyon days when everyone discovered love for others via the magic of house music and smiley T-shirts.

But after experiencing a packed open-air dance event at the MoMA PS1 in Queens I kind of got what everyone was on about. I can only liken it to being in a friendly riot.

A couple of thousand New Yorkers packed into a small space, with some serious eccentric types dotted around. No attitude or bad vibes just a lot of love in the room, man.

All the best, Spencer.
