Jailed: Ian Tracy, who spent 14 months in a Thai prison after wrongly being convicted of being a pedophile

A British charity worker who was falsely accused of being a paedophile and jailed in Thailand for four years has been released on order from the Thai Supreme Court.

Ian Charles Tracy, 47, was released from Nong Plalai Prison, Pattaya, just before the New Year after spending a squalid 14 months in the prison being treated as a child sexual abuser.

It is thought he was was mistaken for another British man - who has been arrested for child sex abuse and attempted murder of a juvenile.

Speaking during an interview in Pattaya, innocent Mr Tracy from Godalming, Surrey, said: 'My whole life has been ruined.

'I have been accused of the vilest of crimes when all I have done is to try to help people.

'I now have to take steps to recover my name in a case which is appalling in the nature of its corruption.

'I have 
been treated worse than scum. I would never consider abusing a child. In
 fact the charities I worked for had programme for children but I did 
not want to get involved because I did not have the training.

'The
 police knew they had the wrong man. But insisted they go ahead with the
 prosecution. I told them they would have to make it all up - and they 
did.'

According to Thai Police, Ian Tracy was 
originally arrested as part of an Operation Naga - an act of 
international co-operation between Britain's Child Exploitation and 
Online Protection Unit (CEOP) which came under the Serious Organised 
Crime Agency and the Royal Thai Police.

Mr Tracy was jailed despite the fact that the 14-year-old boy he was accused of abusing
 told the court he had never seen the man before in his life.

Mr Tracy was acquitted of the crimes at 
earlier trial and was not informed that the decision had been reversed 
following an appeal by the prosecution.

Mr Tracy was working in Pattaya as a volunteer for charity The Mercy Centre and another charity called Hand In Hand.

Through work, he had visited foreign prisoners in Thailand. As a result he had himself had 
been critical of the Thai police accusing them of setting up innocent 
people with child sex abuse charges.
