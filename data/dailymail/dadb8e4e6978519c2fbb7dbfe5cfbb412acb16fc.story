The Obama administration convened a cabinet-level meeting Tuesday afternoon to decide whether U.S. military aid to Egypt will continue, just hours after an aide to a Democratic senator told a reporter the aid had already been placed on a temporary hold.

The U.S. is on schedule to provide Egypt, the most populous nation in the Arab world, with about $1.5 billion in various aid packages, a majority of which is in the form of aid to the nation's military.

'POTUS's Situation Room meeting on Egypt started on time, at 2:30pm,' a White House pool reporter wrote at 4:15pm. 'It's unclear whether pool will have [an] end time.'

Supply: The U.S. provides Egypt with military equipment as part of a $1.3bn foreign aid program

On Tuesday a staffer in the office of Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told The Daily Beast that most military aid and weapons deliveries to Egypt had been halted by the administration, along with civilian economic aid.

But the White House quickly denied those reports, saying no decision had been reached.

Its afternoon meeting of top brass marks a critical moment in the history of U.S.-Egypt relations. The Obama administration's choice of whether to cancel future military aid will be seen as a sign that the White House is choosing sides in the urban warfare that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 so far.

Islamist protesters are demanding a return to power by former president Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. A military coup seized power on July 3. The White House has taken pains to avoid calling it a coup, however, as that designation would have forced the government to cut off aid immediately.

The Foreign Assistance Act, which dates back to 1961, declares that funds allocated to foreign countries become an option exercise if the target nation's 'duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree'.

Presidents since then have displayed great flexibility in interpreting that language, however, despite the lack of a written exception in the law for national security emergencies.

The Obama administration understands that American interests are served by maintaining a working relationship with Egypt's politically powerful armed forces. But in addition to a desire to avoid being the administration that 'lost' Egypt, Obama's senior team wants the administration to seem outraged by the military's attacks on pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters.

Most U.S. aid comes in the form of cash transfers to American military contractors, who then produce and deliver small arms and heavy equipment, including the M1A1 Abrams tank, the F-16 fighter jet and the M16 assault rifle.

Aid: Cash transfers are given to military contractors who deliver equipment such as Apache helicopters

Order: Tanks, such as this one pictured guarding Cairo, are also supplied

In addition to those weapons, 
American defense contractors provide training and spare parts, requiring
constant contact with military officers in Egypt. It's that contact, 
experts say, that allows the U.S. to give the Egyptians a westernized 
frame of reference - one that's favorable to the United States.

Israel is the only nation to get more U.S. aid than Egypt since the end of the 1940s. Through 2011, the U.S. had committed $71.6bn in military and economic aid to maintaining good U.S-Egyptian relations and peace between Egypt and Israel.The Huffington Post published a list of some of the weapons packs that have been included:125 M1A1 Abrams tanksCost: $1.3 billion in 2011Defense Contractor: General Dynamics; Honeywell; Allison Transmission24 F-16 fighter aircraftCost: $3.2 billion in 2009Defense Contractor: Lockheed MartinSix Frigate WarshipsCost: $210 million in 2010Defense Contractor: VSC Global6,900 anti-armor missilesCost: $319 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Raytheon12 Apache helicoptersCost: $820 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing400 Hellfire missilesCost: $51 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Hellfire Limited6 Chinook helicoptersCost: $308 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing2,000 TOW missilesCost: $99 million in 2007Defense Contractor: Raytheon4 Blackhawk helicoptersCost: $167 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Sikorsky

'We
want them to be addicted to U.S. military technology because that gives
us leverage,' Middle East expert and national security columnist 
Richard Miniter told MailOnline.

'Our
equipment requires lots of ongoing training -- think aircraft avionics 
-- whereas the Chinese stuff, for instance, doesn't require as much. 
Military-to-military contact creates a military culture that's 
friendlier to the rule of law and democracy.

'Informal contact between military officers can be more productive, over time, than diplomatic summits.'

In addition, the U.S. is delivering aid to Egypt in part to buy preferential access to the Suez Canal and military jet flyover rights. The two countries' relationship dates to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter brought Egypt and Israel together with pledges of peace from both, and economic aid from the U.S.At present, the $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt is the United States' fourth-largest such commitment. Israel gets $3 billion each year; Iraq receives $2.1 billion; and the U.S. sends Pakistan $1.7 billion.

If the White House were to decide to forgo the benefits it receives and pull back its aid packages, it's unlikely the Egyptian military would feel any kind of budget pinch. Saudi Arabia promised Monday that it would make up for any shortfall Egypt's military had as a result of western nations canceling their commitments.

The Saudis already provide the bulk of a $12 billion annual aid package from wealthy Arab countries.

And killing what amounts to a make-work program for favored military contractors - Egypt, according to an August 8 NPR analysis, already has more heavy weaponry than it needs - would cost U.S. jobs.

A manager at Lockheed Martin told MailOnline on background that while Egypt's acquisitions of U.S. hardware isn't the difference between any one company's life or death, the total of military aid to foreign countries represents a significant part of their business.

'There are companies that would lay 
off 500 to 1,000 people if the government stopped subsidizing all this 
equipment to overseas.'

Mr Miniter said another reason to be wary of disconnecting with Egypt's military leaders is that recent history shows the U.S. can find itself in a predicament if it tries to intervene later for national security reasons.

'When we disengaged from the Pakistanis in the 1990s, all the military-to-military contact declined,' he recalled.

'But after 9/11 - after just a decade or so - the military leaders there suddenly were Islamists, bearded, different. Working with them became much more challenging. The same thing could happen in Egypt.'
