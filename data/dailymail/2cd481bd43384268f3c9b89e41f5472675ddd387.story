One manager after another telephoned Brian McDermott over the weekend and told him he’d be mad to accept being reinstated as boss of Leeds United.

They were trying to put him off but it seems to have had the opposite effect. If he really is going crackers, where better to pitch up than the madhouse that is Elland Road?

McDermott clearly saw it that way and had no hesitation picking up where he left off last Friday night, when a call to his home from a lawyer representing would-be owner Massimo Cellino precipitated the most shambolic 72 hours in the club’s history.

Back for now: Brian McDermott was sacked and reinstated as Leeds United boss withing 48 hours

By the time he replaced the receiver, he was out of work. Less than 24 hours later, he was back in work and barely 48 hours after that he appeared at a training-ground press conference yesterday to announce he was still the manager - but might not be by the weekend.

‘One or two said I should give it another go but a lot of important people advised strongly against it,’ said McDermott yesterday.

‘But I was so proud of the response from everyone on Saturday, I had to come back.

‘The fans showed they are a class act, the players did and so did (assistant) Nigel Gibbs, with the way he ran things in my absence.

'It has been very difficult for me - something that should never happen to any manager and hopefully never will again - but I could not walk away from these people.

Stress: McDermott put on a brave face during his Monday morning press conference

‘I sat there at home on Saturday afternoon watching the scores come up and I did wonder what the future might hold.

'But when I got that call from the lawyer on Friday, I  imagined he must be acting for  Mr Cellino and he was the one giving me the bullet. With that in mind, I thought all along it was very odd.’

Oh, and among all the toing and froing, McDermott’s squad acquired a new signing, but he has no idea who he is or which club he’s from.  And even less of an idea how the owner’s treatment of him will pan out.

He added: ‘You have to be the owner of a club to bring new players in, so you surely have to be the owner to sack the manager.

‘It was very strange, to say the least. But questions like “Can I work with him if he does take over?” and “Will I still be in charge for Yeovil next Saturday?” are ones I just can’t answer. Honestly, I have no idea.’

Support: McDermott claimed he wants to stay at Leeds to repay support he has received from the fans

This famous old venue has had its moments down the years, from Peter Ridsdale’s well-fed fish to Ken Bates taking his seat in the directors’ box to chants of ‘Get out of our club’. This, though, tops the lot.

Cellino was so confident his bid for a 75 per cent stake in Leeds had been rubber-stamped by  GFH Capital that he ordered McDermott’s sacking on Friday night, a move that caused uproar among fans who protested before, during and after the following day’s remarkable 5-1 win over Huddersfield.

Such was the outpouring of  support for McDermott that  owners GFH felt compelled to issue a statement in which they ‘wished to make it clear that Brian McDermott remains first-team manager’.

Ah yes, clarity. The one constant of a bewildering three days at a club who were Champions League semi-finalists little over a decade ago. Or perhaps not.

Protest: A Leeds fan shows his discontent over a prospective sale of the club to Massimo Cellino

With Cagliari chairman Cellino still eager to seize a controlling interest, if he passes the Football

League’s fit-and-proper-persons test, who knows what the future holds for McDermott? He certainly doesn’t.

He was forced to concede as much after fronting up at Leeds’ Thorp Arch training ground and fielding questions on the chaos.

Fair play to McDermott. His livelihood is at stake, yet there was still a ready smile and a willingness to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all.

After entering the room,  taking his seat and waiting for the cameras to stop flashing, he was asked to recount the timeline since ‘things went a little awry’ last week.

Still in charge: McDermott admitted people had told him to walk away from Leeds

‘A little awry!’ he said. ‘I’m not sure I’d describe it quite like that. I got a call on Friday night to say I had been relieved of my duties and a letter was on its way to  confirm it.

‘Then on Saturday morning, I got another call from GFH to say that wasn’t the case. I then saw a couple of statements from the club on my iPad, and here I am now. I must say, I didn’t think, on Friday night, I would be sitting before you all today.

'And there are an awful lot of people who told me I shouldn’t be.

‘It’s just great to be back. I walked into the changing room and some of the lads gave me a look and said, “Where have you been all weekend?” You’ve got to laugh.’

Unpopular: Cellino is hoping to secure a 75 per cent takeover of Leeds

Less likely to amuse McDermott is interference, such as former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa being told he can join the coaches in the dug-out and midfielder Andrea Tabanelli being recruited on loan from Cagliari behind his back.

‘I’ve had assurances from the owners about certain things and, for me, no-one goes in the dug-out or the dressing room without the manager’s OK,’ he said.

‘Festa was at the training ground this morning but I’ve only spoken to him once, when he first came over.

'I don’t know anything about the lad we are supposed to have signed and I’m not sure the League have ratified it yet. If they do, he’ll get an opportunity if we feel he is a player who can help us.’

As for the letter that was  supposedly dispatched last  Friday, it has still to drop through McDermott’s front door.

Lost in the post, perhaps. It wouldn’t exactly be out of sync with the last few days, would it?
