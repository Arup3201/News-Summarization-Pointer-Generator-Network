Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has warned that Labour's soft policies on immigration and Europe could cost them the general election

Labour's soft policies on immigration and Europe could cost it the election, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet has warned.

Andy Burnham said voter anger about Labour’s stance on the two issues was a ‘big hurdle’ that could prevent Ed Miliband winning power next year.

In a frank intervention, the Shadow Health Secretary said immigration was repeatedly raised on the doorstep – with voters warning that Labour lacked a ‘clear position’.

Mr Burnham’s comments came at a conference for the Blairite pressure group Progress, in Manchester.

Commenting on the recent elections, he said: ‘I think there is a big hurdle in front of us that we’ve got to be honest about and that is the Labour position on Europe and immigration.

That did come up repeatedly on the doorsteps - I had it every single place that I went to. 

‘And while we’ve really begun to develop the story coming out of our time in Government that addresses people’s concern there is more to do to give people in the party a simple sense of confidence that Labour has got a clear position.’

Mr Burnham said Labour had to ‘give people policies actually worth voting for… otherwise we will be on a path towards more and more irrelevance’.

Mr Miliband has apologised several times for the immigration record of the last Labour government.

But he has rejected the Government’s immigration cap and made it clear he will not try to limit the free movement of labour from the European Union.

Speaking at a business event in London yesterday Mr Miliband all but ruled out a referendum on Europe – saying a vote would only be held if there is a major transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels.

The row over immigration threatened to overshadow a bid by Labour to reach out to the business community, which has been alienated by Mr Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric.

The Labour leader told an audience of business executives that he was on a ‘shared mission’ to create prosperity.

But he added: ‘I know we won’t always agree on everything. And I won’t just tell you what you want to hear.’

The attempted charm offensive backfired as business leaders – and some senior Labour figures – said Mr Miliband had to do much more to persuade people he is not anti-business.

Former Labour science minister Lord Sainsbury said industry was ‘rightly worried’ about some of the policies and rhetoric emerging from the party.

Speaking at the same event, he said: ‘This is an issue that needs to be addressed so that when voters go to cast their votes at the general election they know how each of the main political parties views their relationship with industry and their plans for increasing economic growth.

‘Industry as a whole is rightly worried by policies and organisational changes which can introduce uncertainty and bring activities to a halt for a lengthy period while providing few, if any, benefits.’

Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE, warned the audience, which included shadow chancellor Ed Balls, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves: ‘Those in power have got to stop the demonisation of business and businessman, and particularly big business.’

'Those in power have got to stop the demonisation of business and businessmen.'

He added: ‘My watch word for politicians is not to lurch back to moods and practices of the past‎ in a misguided belief that it holds the key to future success. Only honing our national competitive edge is going to deliver a sustainable platform for inclusive prosperity.’

Thomas Cook boss Harriet Green said Mr Miliband’s pronouncements on business were ‘marked by interventionism’. ‘What is the strategy to deliver jobs and growth?’ she said.

In a further blow, a close friend of Mr Miliband warned he would be a ‘disaster at Number 10’.

Jenni Russell, whose child Mr Miliband is godfather to, said he had surrounded himself with a divided and incompetent team who were unable to cover up his ‘weaknesses’.

And she warned the Labour leader himself is too inward-looking.

Writing in the Times, she said: ‘This strategy might just win Mr Miliband the election but it is a hopeless strategy for government. A leader who can’t inspire confidence, build alliances or enthuse his colleagues will fall apart in Number 10.’
