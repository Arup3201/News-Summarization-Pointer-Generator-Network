Switzerland star Xherdan Shaqiri says Roberto Mancini was the reason he decided to swap Bayern Munich for Inter Milan.

Shaqiri struggled to secure a regular starting place in his three years at Bayern Munich and made the move to the San Siro in January after speaking with Mancini.

The 23-year-old had offers to move to Spain and England but opted for Inter and hopes to repay the faith shown in him by Mancini.

Speaking in La Gazzetta dello Sport, he said: ‘Inter had been in contact with my agents and my brother Erdin for some time.

'Then there were two phone calls from Mancini. We had two good chats. I immediately felt like I would be very important for him.

'At my age, what interested me most was the chance to play regularly, which hadn’t happened a lot lately.

Shaqiri spoke to Inter manager Roberto Mancini and he swayed him to move to the San Siro

'Mancini explained to me that I would see a lot of time on the pitch. He spoke about his philosophy and that of the club, and his desire to take Inter back to its glorious recent past.’

Inter travel to Napoli on Sunday and will look to get back to winning ways after defeat by Fiorentina last week, but Shaqiri knows it will not be an easy game.

He added: ‘It is not easy to win at Napoli, but getting three points there would be very important psychologically. We must play well and try to grow. We have everything it takes to do that.'
