The stepdaughter of Texas Ebola victim, Thomas Duncan, who called 911 and rode in the ambulance with the man she calls 'Daddy' has been told she can return to work, MailOnline can reveal.

Nursing assistant Youngor Jallah, 35, has been in 'quarantine' in her small Dallas apartment along with her husband, Aaron Yah, 43, and their four children ages 2 to 11 since Thomas Duncan's devastating diagnosis last Monday.

MailOnline has reported that Mr Yah, also a nursing assistant, had been told he could return to work at the end of last week.

Green light: Youngor Jallah, the stepdaughter of Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, told MailOnline that the CDC has told her that she could return to work as a nursing assistant. But she isn't leaving her home at the moment

Fighting for life: Thomas Eric Duncan, seen here with a relative when he first landed in the U.S., is in a critical condition and is now receiving an experimental drug to help save him

Ms Jallah whose contact with Mr Duncan - who remains in a critical condition - was far more intimate and prolonged than that of her husband, told MailOnline on Monday: 'The CDC came yesterday. They said I can go back to work but I do not know what I will do. I will not go back yet.'

Doctors say that no-one is at risk of catching the virus unless they come into contact with a sufferer who is exhibiting symptoms. 

But it is unlikely that Youngor will return to work until the family have gone through the 21 days considered the latest time between exposure and manifestation of Ebola.

She does not intend to allow her eldest child to return to school before the October 17. She has no child-care provisions either - as her mother, Louise Troh, 54, the woman who Mr Duncan traveled to the States to marry, provided childcare and remains in quarantine in a secret location along with her 13-year-old son, nephew and a friend.

The decision to let Ms Jallah return to work is proof of CDC official's confidence that there are no contagious carriers of Ebola in the community.

But Ms Jallah and her family still live with the fear that they may develop symptoms.

She does not hug or kiss her children out of fear and the family pray together each day, asking God to 'Destroy Ebola', to save their family, to save America.

It was Ms Jallah who first raised the alarm after Mr Duncan’s condition suddenly worsened. He had been sent home from his first hospital visit with medication for his diarrhea.

Ms Jallah had seen Mr Duncan following his arrival in the States at the end of last month. Her children had slept in the apartment. 

Clean up: Workers in hazmat suits continued to scrub down and clear out the apartment Duncan stayed in

Sick with worry: Aaron Yah and his family are being monitored by the CDC after visiting Ebola victim Thomas Dunn on Sunday - the day he was taken to hospital and put in isolation

On Sunday September 28, Ms Jallah said, her mother called her and asked her to come to their home in the now infamous Ivy Apartments complex.

Speaking to the Washington Post Ms Jallah recalled her mother's words: 'She said, "Your step daddy is not feeling OK. He's been going to the bathroom all night. You should come over and fetch him some breakfast.'

Ms Jallah did not bring her children with her when she went over, though Mr Yah also saw Mr Duncan that morning.

He told MailOnline: 'He was lying on the bed. I asked him how he was and he said, "I'm not okay".'

By the time Ms Jallah arrived Mr Duncan had no appetite for breakfast.

She recalled: 'I brought him hot tea but he could drink only half of it.'

A trained nursing assistant, Ms Jallah took his temperature which was 104F and his blood pressure which was low.

She said: 'I went to Walmart to get him a blanket and put it round him but he was so sick.’

It was Ms Jallah who told Mr Duncan he had to go to hospital and who called 911.

She travelled with her stepfather in the ambulance, bringing the contaminated blanket with her and warning the emergency workers to be careful of 'viruses' because he was from West Africa.

They immediately put on their masks.

Yet in spite of this close and prolonged contact with Mr Duncan - who neighbors reported was 'vomiting wildly' before the arrival of the ambulance - Ms Jallah and her family were left completely in the dark as to what precautions they should take.

MailOnline first reported the family's distress at having no instructions from the CDC and revealed that they had placed themselves under quarantine.

When violent storms swept Dallas on Thursday they were left without power, without information and without food and diapers for their youngest child.

Power was only returned to their apartment yesterday.

As Mr Duncan continues to fight for his life and remains in critical condition the emotional toll that this ordeal has taken on the family as a whole is clear.

On Sunday, George Mason, Senior Pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church where Ms Troh worships, told of her agony as she lives 'moment by moment'.

He revealed that she had not been able to speak with Mr Duncan since his condition was downgraded to critical. He said, ‘His life is hanging in the balance.’

Missteps: CDC and Dallas officials had to admit another failing on Sunday when they revealed that a homeless man - who was in the ambulance after Duncan - had walked off while receiving treatment

It was confirmed on Monday that Mr Duncan is now receiving an experimental drug - different to that given to two American doctors who contracted the virus in Africa. 

Pharmaceutical company Chimerix announced that the Federal Drug Administration has approved the use of its drug brincidofovir to treat Ebola victims during emergency situations. 

The FDA has extended an Emergency Investigational New Drug Application meaning that the drug can be used without waiting for the results of more stringent agency testing.

Meanwhile, CDC assurances that the situation was under control was dealt a severe blow as it emerged that the homeless man who had been the first patient to ride in the ambulance following Mr Duncan had gone missing.

Officials were forced to admit that he had 'wandered off' while under observation.

Michael Lively has since been found and is being held in the psych ward of Parkland Hospital while authorities seek a court order to keep him there against his will until he has proved asymptomatic for 21 days.

Public health officials have insisted that there is ‘zero risk’ that he is contagious.

The CDC has also announced that it may consider introducing screening to travellers arriving from Ebola affected countries.

Critics have questioned the efficacy of health checks including taking travelers' temperatures pointing to the fact that Mr Duncan was apparently fit and healthy when he landed on US soil with his deadly cargo.

But the White House has ruled out a travel ban from effected countries.
