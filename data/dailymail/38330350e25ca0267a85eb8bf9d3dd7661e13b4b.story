The Queen asked if it was true that Richard III was really found buried under a car park. A 3D model of the king is pictured

Richard III is to make history by becoming not only the last English king to die in battle, but also the first to have his genetic code sequenced.

Scientists want to map the king’s DNA before his remains, and any samples taken from them, are reinterred.

They hope the work will reveal information about the dead monarch’s hair and eye colour and shed light on his ancestry and links to people living today.

Researchers are also hoping the sequencing will provide more details about the king's susceptibility to diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes.

Experts have already learned that besides being a hunchback, the king was badly infected with roundworm, a once common parasite in the UK.

A battle-scarred skeleton with a twisted spine was unearthed by archaeologists in a Leicester car park last year.

It was later identified as that of Richard III.

Dr Turi King, from the University of Leicester, who is leading the gene sequencing project, said: 'It is an extremely rare occurrence that archaeologists are involved in the excavation of a known individual, let alone a king of England.

'At the same time we are in the midst of a new age of genetic research, with the ability to sequence entire genomes from ancient individuals and with them, those of pathogens that may have caused infectious disease.

'Sequencing the genome of Richard III is a hugely important project that will help to teach us not only about him, but [stir up] discussion about how our DNA informs our sense of identity, our past and our future.'

Scientists will also sequence the genome of one of the king’s confirmed living relatives, Michael Ibsen.

The Canadian-born cabinet maker, from London, is a descendant of Richard III’s sister, Anne.

Only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before, and none with Richard III’s noble pedigree.

They include Otzi the iceman, whose mummified 3,000-year-old remains were found in the Italian Alps in 1991, as well as various Neanderthals, a Denisovan - an early human from Siberia - a Greenlandic Inuit and a Spanish hunter-gatherer.

Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in 
Northamptonshire.

During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne.

Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king.

In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm 
for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V.

Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate.

Richard III took to the throne the following day.

He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign.

In 1485, Henry 
Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.

Many of Richard III's key 
lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.

It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. 

Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil 
taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.

Advanced techniques may make it possible to detect DNA from other organisms, including infectious bacteria, in the samples taken from Richard III’s bones.

Whole genome sequencing of Otzi’s remains, for example, revealed evidence of the first known human Lyme disease infection.

Results from the analysis of King Richard III's bones will be made available to historians, scientists, and interested members of the public.

Dr Dan O’Connor, head of medical humanities at the Wellcome Trust, which is part-funding the research, said: 'By making this genome available to all, we will ensure that we can continue to learn about Richard’s past - both personal and historic - even once his remains have been interred.'
