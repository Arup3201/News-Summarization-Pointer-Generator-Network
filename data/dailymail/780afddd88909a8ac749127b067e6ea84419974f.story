Car insurance premiums in Britain have come down by £30 in the past 12 months, thanks to tough new measures introduced by the Government after a year of campaigning by The Mail on Sunday against the epidemic of bogus whiplash injury claims.  

The MoS has exposed how law firms and claims management companies (CMCs) have been encouraging motorists to make bogus whiplash claims that have cost the insurance industry more than £2 billion a year and raised every motorist’s premium by £90 annually.

We have revealed how law firms paying referral fees of up to £750  to claims companies for each case they take on fuelled an industry of more than 5,000 unscrupulous CMCs that preyed on vulnerable motorists to make personal injury claims.

The government brought in tough new measures after the Mail on Sunday campaigned against false claims for whiplash

Our investigations revealed how doctors were prepared to write medical reports falsely diagnosing whiplash. 

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling congratulated this newspaper for  its campaign. ‘The Mail on Sunday has fought against all this,’ he said.

‘It’s fought for the rights of the  little guy.’

And he warned: ‘I have a big  message today for the insurers. Premiums need to start coming down .  .  . and if they don’t come down,  I expect insurers to feel the full  wrath of The Mail on Sunday – and  of many, many other people. Including me.’

The Ministry of Justice, which regulates the industry, said companies had been shut down for faking car accidents, cheating customers out of compensation money, and pressuring accident victims via phone calls and text messages into making claims

The industry’s Association of  British Insurers promised to pass on the savings. Spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: ‘We have made a public commitment at a motoring conference with the Prime Minister last year that we will pass on the savings to the consumer. We will do that.’

The latest figures, compiled by the AA, shows that in April last year an average fully comprehensive insurance was £778.38. But by last month the same type of insurance had dropped to £746.75.

The figures reveal that in the past three months alone premiums came down by as much as £10.

And a separate study by insurance comparison website Confused.com says that they may come down by  as much as £100 by the end of  this year. 

The AA said changes in law and a greater public awareness of bogus whiplash claims had a significant impact on reducing the premiums.
