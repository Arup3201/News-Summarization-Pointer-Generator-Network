The organisers of the newly-formed European Rugby Champions Cup – formerly the Heineken Cup – have promised to deliver more money for England's Aviva Premiership clubs and a more attractive competition for fans.

The popular tournament came perilously close to folding last season following a bitter dispute over the distribution of revenue as English clubs refused to continue under terms they saw as being grossly unfair.

The tournament was saved following a carefully negotiated settlement between broadcasters BT Sport and Sky.

Bruce Craig - one of the executive directors of the newly slimmed down competition which begins a week on Friday – insists the new deal will see more revenue for England’s top clubs.

‘After 19 years we have now reached a position where the clubs are in control of their financial future,’ he said.

‘We have increased the television money (with BT Sport) by 60 per cent to around £17.4million over four years. That’s a significant uplift on the turnover of last year’s competition.’

There is a new business model with five prospective sponsorship slots and Craig believes it is a matter of time before more big-name companies join Heineken in backing the tournament.

He added: ‘It’s a complicated position because the TV rights weren’t in place. They are now. There's been a lot of interest from a lot of big multi-national companies. We are very confident of bringing in more partners over the next 12 months.’

Tournament organisers are also pushing for an end-of-season clash between the winners of the ERCC and the southern hemisphere’s Super Rugby competition.

‘If we get the approval for it we’re not very far away,’ said Aviva Premiership boss Mark McCafferty.

‘It’s always a calendar issue. Personally I don’t think we’re that far off because the public want to see us. The unanswered question at club and provincial level is ‘who is top dog in the world?’

Meanwhile, Bath expect it will take rugby-league convert Sam Burgess at least a fortnight before he is given the all-clear to fly back to England from Australia following surgery on a double facial fracture sustained in Sunday’s NRL Grand Final.

Burgess is not expected to play for Bath before Christmas.

Bath boss Mike Ford said: ‘He’s come out of surgery. It’s good, it’s gone well. They’re just sitting around figuring out when he can travel. It’s a minimum of two weeks. Just the return to training and taking contact, we haven’t got that date yet.’
