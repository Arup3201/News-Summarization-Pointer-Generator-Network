A worker sorting trash at a Southern California recycling plant has found a dead baby girl on a conveyor belt.

The child's body, wrapped in a blanket, was discovered Thursday morning at the facility in Victorville.

There is no immediate word on the child's age, and remains unclear whether the baby was killed or was stillborn. An autopsy has been scheduled to determine the cause and manner of death.

Tragic find: Authorities say a worker sorting trash at the plant found the infant's body

Authorities said the recycling center serves residents and businesses in the High Desert area northeast of Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Mountains.

The horrific discovery was made just before 11.30am when an employee at Burrtec Waste Industries in the 17000 block of Abbey Lane found came across a deceased infant swaddled in a blanket while sorting through recyclables. 

‘The sheriff's department is asking that the public, anyone who has information of a female may have recently given birth and who does not have their baby in their custody, that they would please call sheriff's homicide,’ said Jodi Miller, with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, according to the station KTLA.
