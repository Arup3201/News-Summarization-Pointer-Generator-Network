The guardsman who pirouetted in front of Buckingham Palace was only pulling a harmless prank, his friends said last night.

The soldier has been identified as Grenadier Guard Samuel Holmes. He became an internet sensation when he was filmed prancing outside the Queen’s London home while on duty.

Tourists cheered the 20-year-old on as he eased the boredom of a two-hour shift by twirling about in his red tunic and bearskin.

Named: Samuel Holmes (pictured) has been named as the Grenadier Guardsman facing military prison for pirouetting outside Buckingham Palace

His antics have been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. But the Army and Ministry of Defence are furious that he made a mockery of what is supposed to be a solemn duty.

Private Dancer, as he has been dubbed, will have to face the music – and could be handed up to 21 days in military prison and a £1,000 fine.

A friend said: ‘Sam is a joker – he is always making the other lads laugh. He’s got loads of videos online of him larking about. And he really loves to dance.

‘The strict routines of Army life can get a bit heavy sometimes and Sam enjoys cheering people up. He had no idea how seriously his latest stunt would be taken – and it has worried his family.

‘They were so proud of him and would tell anyone who would listen their son is a guardsman. Now he’s getting attention for the wrong reasons. It was a prank and everyone is hoping his bosses don’t make too much of an example out of him.’

Guardsman Holmes, from Derby, showed off some remarkably elegant moves – but soldiers who guard the Queen are trained to be unflinching and expressionless.

The three-minute film shows him strutting around and swinging his hips before launching into the series of pirouettes.

A child can be heard saying: ‘That’s really silly. Do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman?’

A military source said that senior officers would probably take a dim view, adding: ‘He is there to guard Buckingham Palace, not provide horseplay for tourists.’

The MoD said that it had launched an investigation.

His father Marc, who is also thought to have been a Grenadier guardsman, said: ‘It would be unfair to comment given the Army’s charges hanging over him.’

Online sensation: Footage of the 20-year-old soldier performing ballet-style dance moves to the amusement of waiting tourists has seen by more than 2.25 million people since it was uploaded to YouTube last month

Punishment: The soldier is facing having to complete hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex. He also faces losing his wages for the period of his sentence
