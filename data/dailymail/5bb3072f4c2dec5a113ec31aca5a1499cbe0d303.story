 A family feud in Conyers, Georgia ended in bloody murder of the mother of two identical twin girls--one of whom faces 30 years in prison, and the other who may be sentenced for life.

Tasmiyah Whitehead, 20, pleaded guilty on Thursday to voluntary manslaughter of her mother Jarmecca 'Nikki' Whitehead, 34. The murder occurred almost four years ago on January 13.

Tasmiyah also pleaded guilty to possession of a knife during the crime and falsification in government matters, reports the Atlanta Journal Constitution. She will face 30 years in prison.

Tasmiyah's twin Jasmiyah, 20, will go to trial in March for her role in the murder and she could face a life's sentence. Unlike her sister, she refused a plea deal.

It's unclear as to whether Tasmiyah will testify against her sister.

The girls, who were 16 at the time of the 2010 killing, severed their mother's spinal cord. Jarmecca also suffered from stab wounds to her lungs, jugular, and the back of her neck, said prosecutors.

Tasmiyah recently told prosecutors she and her sister woke up late for school and saw their mother in the kitchen, Rockdale District Attorney Richard R. Read said on Thursday.

He describes how the girls' mother hit Jasmiyah with a pot.

'Tas took the pot from their mother and Nikki grabbed a steak knife,' said Read.

'There was name-calling and cursing and gouging and scratching and everybody was mad,' Read said.

'During the fight, her mom was cut and stabbed,' he continued.

Jarmecca tried to seek refuge at a neighbor's house but no one was home, said read. She sat back down at the kitchen table and that's when the last of the attack leading top her death occurred.

The girls were once A students and girl scouts but then became interested in marijuana and boys

'Tas said Nikki came and sat down in the kitchen … she was tired,' Read said. 'Tas said Nikki lunged at the knife. Eventually the blows necessary to bring about the death of Nikki Whitehead were given.'

After the murder, the girls went to school. It wasn't until later that day that the girls summoned a Rockdale County Sheriff's deputy who was driving by their home. They lied and said they found their mother dead.

Police found cut and bite marks on the twins implicating their involvement in the scuffle.

Both girls originally pleaded not guilty and were arrested and charged after four months of police investigation.

The family had a violent history prior to the fight the scaled to murder.

The girl once had straight As and were girl-scouts, but their grades started to slip and they were interested in boys.

Their mother accused them of smoking pot and being sexually active.

The girls also accused their mother of using illegal drugs.

The girls claimed that their mother was a hypocrite because she also smoked pot and was promiscuous

'Nikki believed they were sexually active, using marijuana and skipping school,' he said. 'They believed she was a hypocrite because she was promiscuous and used marijuana.'

The twins got in a fight with their mother earlier in 2008 and were forced by a juvenile court to live with their great-grandmother Della Frasier.

They moved back with their mother a week before the murder. Read says the twins told a counselor that if forced to go back to their mother's home they would kill her.

'Jasmiyah said, ‘If I have to move back with her, I’ll kill her,’' he said in court Thursday.The girls have been in jail since their arrest in 2010.

When Tasmiyah was 17, she was moved to Rockdale County jail and she will stay there until she is moved to a Department of Corrections facility to do the rest of her time.

Jasmiyah, who will have trial in March, is being held without bond in Newton County jail in Covington.

'All members – mom, great-grandmother and the girls – struggle to take their own responsibility for family stress. The adults in this family have failed to guide these children properly,' said Read who read notes from a juvenile court counselor.

Jarmecca's mother and Frazier's daughter , Lydia Whitehead, told the court she was heartbroken. She said she loves and forgives the twins but wish that they hadn't committed such a terrible crime.

'Unfortunately, my grandchildren never learned right from wrong … and that’s why we are here,' she said. 'They should be in college, not sitting somewhere in jail.'

Friends of the girls created a facebook page to support them.
