Swatch, the world's
largest watchmaker unveiled its riposte to Apple's smartwatch.

It plans to put cheap
programmable chips in watches that will let wearers from China
to Chicago make payments with a swipe of the wrist.

Swatch Group will start offering watches with near
field communication (NFC) chips within two months, said at a news conference on the company's
annual results which were released last month.

We're coming for you Apple! Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said Apple's launch was a 'fantastic opportunity' for the Swiss watchmaker.

The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. 

Apple's move into watches would open up a market where
Swatch was already well positioned to compete, he said.

The Swiss company's strategy appears to revolve around
including individual tech features in different models rather
than going head to head with Apple, the world's most valuable
firm, to create all-in-one smartwatches combining many
functions.

'We are the world champions of integrating smart functions
into a watch,' Hayek said. 

'We don't want to produce a mini
mobile phone on your wrist. Others can do that.'

At 1600 GMT, Swatch shares were up 2.7 percent at 432.1
Swiss francs.

Apple's watch will go on sale in nine countries starting in
April, priced from $349 for the smaller model and $549 for the
standard version, although a high-end 'Edition' watch will sell
for at least $10,000.

'It's a fantastic opportunity for us. It is opening the
market. 

'Especially in the U.S., many people are not wearing
watches any more. Somebody is opening this up. Let Apple do the
work. It's fine. It's good. I congratulate them.'

Both firms' strategies could co-exist and succeed, Hayek
said, before adding a dig at the bigger rival: 'Upgrading
software every year, that's not our business.'

For its near-field chips, which will cost around 2 francs
($2) per watch, Swatch has teamed up with China UnionPay, the
Chinese credit card association, as well as a Swiss bank and a
major credit card company.

The credit card company, described as an Olympics sponsor,
is likely to be Visa, a long-time backer of the event.
Visa was not immediately available to comment.

Swatch is also launching a range of sports-themed 'Swatch
Touch' smartwatches which will be able to 'buddy up' with a
smartphone via a Bluetooth connection.

The first model will retail at 135 francs, about twice the
cost of a regular Swatch watch with an NFC chip.
