Republican heavyweight Chris Christie was left in tears last night after a top GOP politician who helped kick-start his political career collapsed and died in a statehouse bathroom.

Alex DeCroce, 75, of Parsippany, New Jersey, served as the state Assembly GOP leader for nine years, but died at 11pm on Monday after a long and busy final day of the state’s legislative session.

His death has stunned state Assembly and Senate members, with New Jersey Governor Christie describing him as a ‘dear friend, colleague and mentor’ and ‘kind, considerate and trustworthy’.

As the busy final day of the state’s legislative session was coming to a close, most lawmakers were preparing to head home for a few hours of sleep before the new session got under way.

But in a matter of moments, everything changed as the Assembly and Senate members, along with their aides and other staffers, learned that Mr DeCroce had collapsed on Monday night.

The Legislature wrapped up its session with a flurry of last-minute bills - and one of his final acts as the GOP leader was to accuse Democrats of casting votes for an absent member.

The death threw the Legislature's reorganisation plans for Tuesday into turmoil and caused Governor Christie to delay his annual state-of-the-state address.

The Assembly and Senate greatly scaled back swearing-in ceremonies for new members. Governor Christie planned to talk about Mr DeCroce at the Assembly in lieu of his scheduled address.

Assemblyman Herb Conaway, the Legislature's only physician, attended to Mr DeCroce at the scene, but it was too late. A cause of death was not immediately known.

Governor Christie, a fellow Republican and personal friend of Mr DeCroce for 20 years, confirmed the death more than two hours after Mr DeCroce was declared dead.

‘Tonight I lost a dear friend, colleague and mentor,’ Governor Christie said last night. ‘He helped to give me my start in elective politics in Morris County in 1993.

‘He was one of the most kind, considerate and trustworthy people I have ever had the pleasure to know. This is an enormous loss for our state and for me personally.’

An obviously-emotional Governor Christie returned to the capital around midnight, wearing a sport jacket over a t-shirt and loafers but no socks.

Mr DeCroce, who lived in Parsippany-Troy Hills, served in the Assembly since 1989 and became the GOP's leader there in 2003. His district included parts of Morris and Passaic counties.

His wife, Betty Lou DeCroce, is a deputy commissioner with the Department of Community Affairs.

Mr DeCroce's death comes on the heels of the passing of another GOP assemblyman, Peter Biondi, on November 10 - two days after he was re-elected to an eighth term.

His fellow GOP politician Jon Bramnick, like other lawmakers, said he noticed Mr DeCroce didn't seem to feel well on Monday during the marathon session.

'But there was no indication that it was the result of anything other than it being a long day,' Mr Bramnick said. 'It was 11 at night and no one was feeling too well.'
