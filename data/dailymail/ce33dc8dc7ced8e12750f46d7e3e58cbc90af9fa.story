Cesc Fabregas enjoyed some time off during the international break as he was pictured leaving a London restaurant with girlfriend Daniella Semaan and Lionel Messi's other half Antonella Roccuzzo.

The Chelsea midfielder looked very cosy with the glamorous WAGS as the trio walked arm-in-arm after piling out of the restaurant on Saturday evening.

Roccuzzo was left to play gooseberry with Fabregas and Semaan as Lionel Messi was training with Argentina ahead of his side's clash with Portugal at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Vicente del Bosque has warned Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas their places are under threat

But former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder Fabregas was left out of the Spain squad to face Belarus for a Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday before a glamour friendly with Germany three days later to recover from an injury sustained during Chelsea'a 2-1 win over Liverpool.

Spain manager Vicente del Bosque has been at loggerheads with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho regarding Fabregas and striker Diego Costa, neither of whom were available to Del Bosque for selection in the latest squad.

And the 63-year-old World Cup winning manager fueled the row further on Tuesday insisting the Chelsea duo face a fight to regain their place in the national side.

Speaking to Spanish radio station Onda Cero Del Bosque said: ‘It could be that when Costa and Fabregas come back another player has taken their place. That is not a threat, it’s just reality.’
