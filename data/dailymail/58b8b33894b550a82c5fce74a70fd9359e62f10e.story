There's no getting around it, summer is coming to a close and it's time to embrace autumn. Rather than mourn those long, lazy sunshine days, I'm feeling pretty excited as I'm in the mood for a make-up makeover!

While summer is all about bare-faced beauty, autumn's cool days and long nights allow me to indulge my passion for products, splashing out on gorgeous new colours and scrumptious new ranges from all the big cosmetics brands. Yummy!

To kickstart my new-season make-over, I looked to the autumn/winter catwalk collections for inspiration.

The runways always offer a wealth of brilliant new beauty ideas, and this season didn't disappoint. Topping my list was the catwalk make-up at British superstar brand Burberry. 

The show featured rich, autumnal colours - all lush, berry-stained lips and warm, dusky eyes.

To help me perfect autumn's berry beauty, I've roped in my former MIC co-star and make-up expert Olivia Newman Young, who has translated the catwalk trend into a sultry evening look.

THE EYES 

Once you've applied a fresh, dewy base, begin the look with the eyes. Start by drawing a chestnut-brown eyeliner like Clarins Crayon Khol Eye Pencil in Intense Brown along your upper lash line. 

Don't worry about making the line too neat as next Olivia used a sponge make-up applicator to smudge and blend the liner up into the lid and around the socket, creating a soft wash of colour. 

 

Next draw the same brown liner along the water line and lower lash line, and use a fine brush to smudge the excess colour. The overall effect you're going for is warm, soft and sexy.

Next up, Olivia used the plum eyeshadow from Dior 5 Couleurs Eye Palette in Femme Fleur, blending the colour around the eye socket, adding a touch of the darker purple from the same palette at the outer edges of the socket. 

Then just a light dab of Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Crème Bronzer in Riviera at the inner corners of the eye socket, bringing a softness to the eye colours.

Finish up with a couple of coats of mascara - Olivia used the Dior Addict-It Mascara in It Black. A hint of brow colour (Guerlain Eyebrow Kit has four shades to mix and match) will add definition, creating brows which frame the eyes beautifully.

Binky has opted for deep plum shades to create an autumnal vibe 

THE LIPS AND CHEEKS 

This look is all about a glamorous, berry-stained pout. Before applying the lip colour, Olivia brushed a touch of concealer around the lip line, then, taking a berry-coloured lip pencil, drew a line along the lips, before filling them in with Clarins True Aubergine lipstick. 

Next, taking the same Daniel Sandler cream bronzer used on the eyes, blend a hint of pinky colour over the apples of your cheeks to draw the whole look together. A dusting of Michael Kors Sporty Bronzing Powder adds a final warm, autumnal glow to the skin.

It's an incredibly sexy, sultry look, and since it's catwalk-inspired, it's naturally bang on trend. You can get all the products Olivia used at Escentual.com. I’ve loved having her teach me a few new looks – you can check out her channel here for loads more amazing beauty tutorials.

Binky suggests using warm colours when it comes to fall make-up

I'm so pleased with my new autumn make-up look, I've decided I need some new autumn clothes to go with it. I'm going shopping!

On a separate note, I wanted to let you know about the Nutribullet – a really cool kitchen gadget that blasts fruit and veg into super-healthy, nutrient rich drinks. The great thing about the Nutribullet is that, unlike other juicers or blenders, it fully breaks ingredients down into their most nutritious state, transforming ordinary foods into superfoods.

It couldn’t be easier to use. Simply load the cup with vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds of your choice, place it over the base and twist. Et voila – a supercharged drink packed full of nutrients in a matter of seconds.

You can use the Nutribullet to make a whole range of delicious and healthy juices, smoothies and even soups – it comes with a recipe book crammed with yummy suggestions. The Nutribullet retails for £99 and is available from www.buynutribullet.co.uk.

Until next week, stay gorgeous.
