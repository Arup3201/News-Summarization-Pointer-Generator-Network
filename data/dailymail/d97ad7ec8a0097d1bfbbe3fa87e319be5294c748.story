The BBC today faced calls to apologise for a Top Gear 'stunt' from Argentina's ambassador in London.

Alicia Castro has lodged a formal complaint to the Corporation over Jeremy Clarkson's 'provocative behaviour and offensive remarks' after filming in Argentina.

Top Gear's crew had to leave the country after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some people suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982.

Argentine ambassador Alicia Castro has demanded a public apology from the BBC following the row over a Top Gear special filmed in the South American country.

Top Gear presenters James May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond had to flee Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some people suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982.

Hammond's comments came as Argentina's UK ambassador  accused Clarkson of 'fabricating' claims that  crew members were in danger from an angry mob during filming.

Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman has denied the number plate was a 'stunt'.

Clarkson was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming.

The Argentina embassy in London said in a statement today: 'Argentine Ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, made a formal complaint to the BBC regarding Jeremy Clarkson's provocative behaviour and offensive remarks towards the Government and the Argentine people, following Top Gear's recent filming in Argentina, calling for the BBC to make a public apology.

'Ambassador Castro was received by the BBC's TV Director, Danny Cohen, at the BBC's New Broadcasting House in Portland Place yesterday at 4:30 pm.'

The complaint referred to 'serious accusations' Clarkson had made against the Buenos Aires government which he said had made 'political capital' out of the issue.

The embassy statement went on: 'Furthermore, the Argentine ambassador deeply regretted Jeremy Clarkson's entirely false accusations of alleged resentment against British citizens in Argentina.'

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The BBC has received a complaint and will apply its usual processes.'

The team has claimed Top Gear bought the Porsche - complete with the number plate - in the UK because it was the best available vehicle of its type

Error: The team had first realised the plate could prove to be a problem on the third night of filming, September 19, when Clarkson was on Twitter and spotted a comment on one of the auto fan sites

Top Gear host Richard Hammond last week claimed the programme team felt 'a real chill' when it dawned on them their number plate could cause offence in Argentina. 

Clarkson has maintained the number plate scandal was not deliberate, and said that if it had been, the BBC would have fired him.

Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black.

He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina.

Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said. 

September 16: Top Gear crew starts filming in Argentina for this year's Christmas special. Among the cars being used is a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL.

September 19: Three days into filming, Jeremy Clarkson learns via Twitter that offence has been taken at the number plate. The crew spoke to authorities in Ushuaia, where the war issue is most senstive, and agree to remove the plates before entering the town two weeks later.

The crew continued with the number plate and drove around areas of Argentina including Calafate and Tierra del Fuego. 

September 30: The plate was changed as the team entered Ushuaia. By then animosity had reached boiling point and the crew were forced to flee a baying mob. 

October 2: News of the anger over the plate reaches the UK. BBC bosses insist the choice of number plate was pure coincidence. 

The presenters had fled their hotel after the lobby was invaded by angry ex-military personnel who told them to leave 'or face the consequences'.

Staff told how the demonstrators shouted insults until they were removed by officers, forcing the crew to leave so hurriedly they forgot a computer.

The crew leave for Buenos Aires, where they catch another plane to Chile having been denied permission to film. Juan Manuel Romano, secretary of social development for Ushuaia says the program's crew and its host Jeremy Clarkson were escorted to the airport.

Other members of the BBC2 motoring show's crew were pelted with stones by a jeering mob as they made their way to the border by road, escorted by officials.

All the cars used by the presenters had windows broken, and a number of vehicles were abandoned, including the Porsche with the controversial plate. 

October 4: Clarkson takes to Twitter this morning to confirm that all of the crew had made it safely out of the country and that he was back in the UK.

He said: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it.

'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths.

'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed.

'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong.

'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.'

October 8: Blur's Damon Albarn wades into the row, describing the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole'.

Speaking to fans ahead of a concert in Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, the singer apologised for Clarkson's behaviour, telling them that he thought the stunt was 'not cool'.

October 10: Both presenter James May and executive producer Andy Wilman defend the Top Gear team and insist the use of the number plate was entirely coincidental. 

October 13: Argentina's UK ambassador Alicia Castro accuses Jeremy Clarkson of 'fabricating' claims that  crew members were in danger from an angry mob. He is yet to respond.

The BBC show has a history of upsetting foreign countries. In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.

May described Mexican food as ''like sick with cheese on it'' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because ''at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won't complain, it's fine.'

In fact, the Mexican ambassador His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza wrote to the corporation to complain about the ''outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults'' and the BBC had to say sorry.
