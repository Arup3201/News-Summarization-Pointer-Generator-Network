Chicago is today being battered by winds up to 60mph as 25ft waves crash against the shore.

The southern section of Lake Michigan has seen the huge waves hit with mighty wind gusts, prompting shore line warnings in Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois.

Warnings for storm-forced winds extended to parts of Lake Huron into this morning with forecasts for a lower impact up into Lake Superior.

Gale force winds of up to 45mph were already pushing waves of up to 10ft onto the shore in Chicago on Wednesday, forcing the park district to close part of a lake front jogging and cycling path.

Conditions like these are seen typically about twice a year and the forecasts for winds, waves and flooding are similar to a storm that struck in late September, meteorologist Mike Bardou said.

The large waves are expected to fall to 15ft later on Thursday afternoon, but result in flooding of some areas - and it could well be worse than in September's storm, reported the Weather Channel.

Residents close to Lake Michigan have been told to expect damaged power lines and fallen trees, and advised to secure items such as windows that could be broken by high winds.

On Wednesday, waves on the southern part of Lake Michigan were expected to reach up to 18ft in the afternoon and build into the evening. Winds could have even reached up to 65 mph.

The weather service issued a gale warning for the southern half of Lake Huron on Wednesday, expanding to a warning for storm-level wind gusts possible as far north as Presque Isle, Michigan.

Photos showed some locals braving the conditions on Wednesday by walking near lakefront areas. The temperature is expected to reach around 50F on Thursday.

Power company Commonwealth Edison told the Chicago Tribune that at the latest count only 3,100 customers across its network were without power, down from 8,300 just five hours before.
