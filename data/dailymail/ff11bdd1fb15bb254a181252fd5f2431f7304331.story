Two British women aid workers were kidnapped and raped in front of their father after being stopped at an unofficial checkpoint in Libya.

The sisters were abducted when their vehicle was stopped on the outskirts of the eastern city of Benghazi.

They were taken by men in military uniforms to an isolated farm and subjected to a horrific sex attack in front of their father.

Witnesses said the young women, both Pakistan-born British citizens, were wearing veils and Free Palestine T-shirts. Libyan officials said four suspects have been arrested and security forces are trying to trace a fifth.

It was unclear whether they were part of the ‘revolutionary brigades’ that serve under the country’s security ministries or outlaw militia.

Deputy prime minister Awad al-Barassi said the sisters were in a ‘very bad shape’ after the horrific attack, which happened on Tuesday. Last night they were preparing to fly home to the UK.

He said the women were part of an ten-vehicle aid convoy trying to reach the Gaza Strip with medical supplies. Organised by IHH, a Turkish humanitarian relief organisation, the aid mission left Britain on February 25 but became stuck in Libya when Egyptian border guards refused to let the convoy cross into Egypt.

The family were on a bus on their way to Benghazi’s Benina airport when they were stopped at the unofficial checkpoint by armed young men in military uniforms.

Mr al-Barassi said the women and their father were kidnapped, and the man witnessed his daughters’ rape.

He said he visited the victims and met their father at a Benghazi hospital to apologise on behalf of the Libyan people and government. He described the family as being in a ‘very bad psychological state’.

There were reports that two other members of the aid group were also assaulted by a different armed group and that two others are missing.

The remaining members of the aid convoy travelled to the Turkish consulate in Benghazi for safety.

Mr al-Barassi said those involved in the attack would stand trial soon.

The attack highlights how Libya remains a dangerous place for foreigners in the aftermath of the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime.

Hundreds of heavily armed militia, many with links to criminal gangs, continue to operate freely across the country.
