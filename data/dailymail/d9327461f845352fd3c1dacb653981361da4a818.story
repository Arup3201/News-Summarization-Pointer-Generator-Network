Cyber insecurity: Marc Goodman, a security consultant for organizations like the United Nations and Interpol, has a forthcoming book  about how technology may give the upper hand to criminals

It isn't just researchers finding applications for brain scanning and artificial intelligence, but rather criminals who may be able to exploit these emerging technologies faster than they can be secured.

A new book from security consultant Marc Goodman called Future Crimes exposes the possible threats that a technologically advanced future poses.

'I could see a horrific scenario wherein somebody is kidnapped and threatened that unless they pay an exorbitant sum, their lifelong memories of their wife or daughter would be erased,' Goodman told Singularity Hub. 

'We're a long way away' from that scenario, according to Goodman, a Global Security Advisor for Singularity University, which publishes Hub, though technology like neuropharmeceuticals, which the Army is exploring to minimize traumatic brain activity caused by PTSD, make it a possibility in the future.

Having also consulted for law enforcement organizations like Interpol as well as the United Nations, Goodman cautions that criminals may be among the first adopters of emerging technologies.

One particular area of concern for Goodman is the advancement of artificial intelligence, the ability of computers to perform traditional cognitive functions such as reason, learn and plan.

'We’re using AI every day,' says Goodman. 'Whether it’s in our GPS devices, in our Netflix recommendations, what we see on our Facebook status updates and streams—all of that is controlled via AI.' 

But even these forms of 'narrow' artificial intelligence could be pressed into service by criminals, and Goodman points out one instance where Siri was used to help cover up a murder.

'In one case, a University of Florida student was accused of killing his college roommate for dating his girlfriend,' said Goodman. 'What does he do with the dead body before him?'

'He had never murdered anybody before, and he had no idea how to dispose of the body. So, he asked Siri. The answers Siri returned? Mine, swamp, and open field, among others.' 

Other existing technology that is growing more sophisticated, like EEG headsets, could also be utilized for criminal activity.

Infiltration: Cyber criminals could find a way to insert malware that could access an EEG headset, like the Emoriv Epoc, pictured with its developer edition device, which could be used to scan for personal info

A study by researchers from Oxford, UC Berkley and University of Geneva in 2012 found electroencephalogram devices, which measure the electrical activity in the brain, could be used to steal banking information.

The study found that just by showing an image of a pin pad to a person strapped to an EEG headset, an attacker revealed the victim's PIN 20% of the time, much better than random chance.  

While the term 'cyber Pearl Harbor' has been tossed around as a way to warn about the grave risks associated with not improving the United States' electronic security, Goodman has argued that a 'cyber Manhattan Project' is really what is needed.

The convergence of public and private expertise, like the effort that led to the development of nuclear devices, could lead to technology that secures computers against increasingly frequent attacks.

Goodman writes that computer systems at banks and major retailers like Target and Home Depot that were attacked over the last couple years, as well critical infrastructure are vulnerable. 

'We’ve wired the world, but failed to secure it,' Goodman said.
