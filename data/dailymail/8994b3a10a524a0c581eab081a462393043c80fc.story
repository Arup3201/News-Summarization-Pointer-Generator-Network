Malky Mackay and Paul Jewell emerged as early contenders for the Wigan on Thursday after Uwe Rosler was sacked after 11 months in charge at the DW Stadium.

Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Cardiff City last December, with Sportsmail later revealing that the Welsh club sent a dossier to the FA accusing him of exchanging ‘racist, sexist and homophobic’ texts and email messages with Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody.

Mackay withdrew from the running for the managerial vacancy at Palace in August and issued a public apology.

The 42-year-old attended Wigan’s defeat at Brighton earlier this month and it is understood that the club have already made contact with his representatives.

Jewell famously led Wigan from League One to the Premier League but resigned in 2007 after keeping them in the top-flight on the final day of the season.

The 50-year-old, who has been out of management since leaving Ipswich more than two years ago, held talks with his old club last night over a dramatic return just hours after Rosler was axed.

Latics chairman Dave Whelan says he took a long time to come to the decision to sack Rosler

The German took Wigan to the FA Cup semi-finals and the Championship Playoffs last season after succeeding Owen Coyle in December. However, he has won only once in his last 12 games and Friday’s defeat at Bolton saw his side drop to third from bottom in the Championship.

Having given Rosler his personal backing last week, it is understood that chairman Dave Whelan sacked him after training yesterday amid concerns that he had lost the support of the dressing-room.

Swindon manager Mark Cooper, Blackburn’s Gary Bowyer, Tony Mowbray and Stuart McCall were other names being linked with the vacancy last night.
