As England's last hopes of World Cup glory were dashed by the audacious talent of Uruguay's Luis Suarez on Thursday, his boss at Liverpool appeared to have no interest in the tournament.

Brendan Rodgers was with Liverpool FC's former travel manager Charlotte Hind, 31 exploring the sights of New York's Central Park before visiting the city's famous Museum of Natural History.

Hours before the England's crunch match against Uruguay was due to start, Mr Rodgers and Miss Hind were pictured strolling arm-in-arm through the plaza outside the museum.

As the pair wandered hands-clasped through the courtyard outside the museum, Ms Hind's young daughter was nowhere to be seen.

It was a different story three weeks earlier when, on another getaway, this time to a village in Spain, Mr Rodgers was pictured carrying the girl as they went shopping on a sun-kissed afternoon.

The Reds manager, 41, was also pictured lifting the little girl out of the child seat of a shopping trolley. Ms Hind is currently divorcing her husband of five years, but Mr Rodgers has denied that they are having a romantic relationship.

Meanwhile, his mind may be on the fate of superstar striker Suarez, after La Liga superclubs Real Madrid and Barcelona were said to reaching down the back of their respective sofas to gather the pennies for a mammoth £100million dollar bid for the England slayer.

Suarez left England stunned on Thursday night when he put himself on the end of one perfect pass and another fluke deflection to bury the Three Lions' World Cup chances for yet another four years.

So when the post-World Cup transfer window opens, Mr Rodgers will have to be ready to kiss Liverpool's talisman goodbye.

Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Mr Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football.

He has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat.

The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground.

Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of the city for £1.2million.

Last month Mr Rodgers was at Ms Hind's home when a man battered the front door with a cricket bat.

He was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Ms Hind when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse.

Mr Rodgers told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Mr Rodgers to come into the street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door.

He then jumped back in his car and left. Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrived, but the man was gone.

A neighbour told the Mirror: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn.

'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.'
