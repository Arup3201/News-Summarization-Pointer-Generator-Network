Former model and Baseball Wives star Anna Benson pleaded guilty today to attacking her Mets pitcher husband Kris Benson, with whom she has three children, in Georgia.

The 37-year-old was sentenced to 15 years probation and 90 days of inpatient psychiatric therapy at an out-of-state facility in exchange for her plea.

Benson broke into her estranged husband's home on July 7 with a gun and a metal baton and threatened to kill him if he didn't give her $30,000.

Court: Anna Benson made a plea deal in court today which consists of 15 years probation and psychiatric treatment for 90 days (pictured in court on August 2)

Prison has clearly taken its toll on Anna since her time in jail over the past four months (pictured in court on August 2, left, and at a Las Vegas club before the arrest, right)

She plead guilty to aggravated 
assault and gun possession but prosecutors have dismissed the burglary 
charge and aggravated assault charge for her plea at Cobb County 
Superior Court in Marietta, Georgia.

Benson arrived in court wearing glasses and her navy blue prison jumpsuit - she has been in jail since July 7.

Her
psychiatric therapy can range from anger and violence management, 
substance abuse and post traumatic stress disorder therapy, her attorney
Ashleigh Merchant told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

If
she goes five years without committing another felony or violating her 
probation which restricts her from coming within 500 yards of her 
husband, or threatening him and their children, then the second five 
years of her probation will be unsupervised.

If she keeps within the terms of those 10 years, the final five years will be dismissed.

Kris Benson wanted a harsher sentencing and did not want the court to accept the plea deal.

Mr Benson filed for divorce from Anna in March 2012, but it has not yet been finalized.

Listen to Kris Benson's 911 call:

The
Baseball Wives star was also charged with the murder of a man in 
Tennessee in 1996. She was on the run for five months and though the 
charges were later dropped.

Benson's
attorney asked for $50,000 bond as well as an ankle monitor and 
psychological treatment after her arrest on July 7. But Judge LaTain 
Kell denied this.

'Despite the Court’s order that 
Defendant vacate the marital residence, she allegedly returned to the 
home with a handgun, ammunition, a knife, and a metal baton and 
threatened her estranged spouse and demanded money from him,' Kell wrote
in his decision.

Arrested: Anna Benson, the estranged wife of ex-baseball pitcher Kris Benson, was arrested on July 7, 2013

'There was no evidence presented that the domestic 
circumstances which preceded these alleged events have changed.'

Officers
arrived at the 1160 block of Drewsbury Court to find Benson, star of 
the VH-1 reality series, Baseball Wives, wearing a bullet proof vest and
an ammunition belt containing several rounds.

She
had a Batman knife in her waistband, a police-issue baton in her hands 
and a revolver in her purse, according to the incident report, obtained 
by the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

The
911 call made by Kris Benson was later released and the Mets pitcher 
sounded calm as he quietly told the operator he is hiding in the 
basement.

'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette,' Mr Benson said in the 911 call, which was released by TMZ.

'When I left the room, I just did a beeline for the basement.'

As
the operator tells him to stay on the line, Mr Benson can be heard 
saying: 'I just got my hand on the back door in case I hear her coming 
down the stairs.'

He then fled the house and hid in his neighbor's garden until police arrived.

When the 911 operator asked him what his wife had said, he explained that he had managed to record her. 

Mr
Benson also appears to stifle a shocked laugh when he explains that his
'soon to be ex-wife' was wearing a bulletproof vest when she allegedly 
threatened him.

Mrs Benson however, told the New York Post last month: 'I would never hurt [Kris]. I am still in love with him.'

Rocky relationship: Kris Benson and his wife Anna have filed for divorce at least twice since they married in 1999

Operator: 'OK, what is she wearing?'Benson: 'She's wearing a bulletproof vest' [appears to give a shocked laugh] Operator: 'She's wearing a bulletproof vest?'Benson: 'Yes.'Operator: 'And she threatened you with a gun?'Benson: 'Correct'                                           Operator: 'Is that your ex-wife?'Benson: 'Soon-to-be-ex-wife. Going through a divorce.'

Benson: 'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette. When I left the room [unintelligible] down into the basement.'Operator: 'Did she know where you went?'Benson: 'No.'Operator: 'Was she looking for you?'Benson: 'Yes.'

She added: 'We have been married for 15 
years, and he can’t keep it in his pants. He can’t stop f*****g my 
friends, in my house. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him.'

When police arrived at the scene, she yelled that her husband was a 'f****** p****'.

She was made temporarily famous by VH1's 'Baseball Wives,' a 2011 reality show that was cancelled after only one season.

Mr Benson pitched in the majors for five teams - including the New York Mets - from 1999 to 2010, when he retired.

He married the former exotic dancer and model, at the start of his major league career in 1999.

The couple have had a rocky relationship, including bouts of cheating and more than one divorce filing.

In 2006, Mrs Benson filed for divorce after she allegedly caught her husband cheating on her with one of her friends.

The couple, who have three children,
decided to  stay together- even though she had 
famously told Howard Stern that she would sleep with the entire Mets 
team if he ever cheated.

She
later told ESPN, however, that she was kidding around with her comment 
to Stern and that she wouldn't touch 'some of those guys with a 10ft 
pole.

'I don't care what Kris did. Some of them are disgusting.'

In
another divorce filing from 2012, Mrs Benson again accused her husband 
of cheating, saying she found racy messages between him and one of her 
friends on Facebook.
