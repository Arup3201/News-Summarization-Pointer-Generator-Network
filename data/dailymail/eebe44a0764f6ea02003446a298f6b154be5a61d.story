She might have spent yesterday afternoon living the life of a royal in-law at Buckingham Palace but it was business as usual for Pippa Middleton today.

Dressed in a cheerful print pencil skirt and neat black top, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister looked tanned and relaxed as she strolled along a central London street on her way to join a friend for lunch.

Pippa, the recently crowned 'Aunty of the Year', has been keeping a low profile of late while she concentrates on work projects, including her role as a contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

She has also, according to recent reports, been eyeing up a £3m pied-à-terre in the middle class Parsons Green in west London.

Despite boyfriend Nico Jackson's imminent move to Geneva, the 30-year-old and her stockbroker beau are thought to be purchasing the property together.

The home features six double bedrooms and a nanny quarters - adding fuel to rumours the couple of two years are planning for a child.

Currently, Pippa lives with her brother James, 27, at a property owned by their parents Carole and Michael.

Friends: Pippa was joined by a friend who also seemed to be enjoying the sunshine as they strolled along

While she waits to hear about her potential new home, Pippa has been throwing herself into London life and made several visits to Wimbledon.

She's also become a regular sight at London's more upmarket bars and restaurants, among them West London favourite, Maggies.

Despite her busy social life, Pippa remains a hands-on aunt to nephew Prince George and was at the top of the guest list - the Queen notwithstanding - for his first birthday celebrations yesterday.
