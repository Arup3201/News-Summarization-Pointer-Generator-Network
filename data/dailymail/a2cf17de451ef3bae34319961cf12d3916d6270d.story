It may not have been quite the trophy he was hoping for at the start of the tournament, but James Rodriguez still seemed delighted at winning the World Cup Golden Boot following full time between Germany and Argentina.

The 22-year-old was filmed celebrating with a mixture of elation and relief as he joined the esteemed list of men to top score at a World Cup finals.

Rodriguez and Colombia exited the competition at the quarter-final stage, and it seemed as though his six goals haul from five games was not going to be quite enough.

Delight: But he celebrates with his family after Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller both fail to score

At that point, Lionel Messi, Neymar and Thomas Muller - all on four goals - were still in the competition.

Muller scored in the 7-1 rout of Brazil in the semi-finals to put him onto five, but Neymar didn't play again in the tournament after suffering injury against Colombia.

But Rodriguez eventually, and deservedly, prevailed after both the German and Messi failed to score in the final at the Maracana.

The Monaco attacker, who has been 
heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid since his stunning displays in
 Brazil, was 100-1 with bookmakers to finish top scorer before the start of the tournament.
