The owner of British Airways today launched a £1billion takeover bid for Aer Lingus in an attempt to secure valuable take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport.

IAG, which currently owns BA and Iberia, has offered a deal worth €2.55 a share, or €1.36billion in total, to buy Ireland's national airline.

The company is keen to secure more space at the UK's biggest airport, which is almost full to capacity - meaning that landing slots are now worth millions of pounds.

But the deal could be scuppered by the Irish government, which may block the move for political reasons, or by Ryanair, whose combative boss Michael O'Leary has long been trying to buy Aer Lingus.

The Dublin-based airline confirmed this morning that its board was considering a new offer from IAG, having previously rejected two lower bids out of hand.

IAG warned that this offer could be the last throw of the dice for the proposed deal, saying: 'There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming.'

The company's chief executive, Willie Walsh, was previously in charge at Aer Lingus before moving across the Irish Sea and joining BA.

As well as the potential for efficiency savings by bringing Aer Lingus into a larger group, IAG is keen to expand its grip on Heathrow, where it is already by far the largest operator.

BA controls more than half the landing slots at the airport, according to the latest available figures, and if it were combined with Aer Lingus and Iberia, IAG would have 56 per cent of all flights coming into and going out of Heathrow.

If the three airlines joined forces, they would account for 51.6 per cent of passengers passing through the airport.

Because Heathrow is running at almost full capacity, the only ways for an airline to expand its offerings at the airport are to trade in landing slots - worth several millions of pounds each - or to buy up a rival.

Aer Lingus is currently the fourth busiest operator at the airport, behind BA, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, running up to 22 flights a day between Heathrow and Dublin.

Heathrow could expand if a third runway is built, but the issue is politically controversial and no decision will be made on the matter until after the general election in May.

Analysts suggested today that the IAG bid was likely to be accepted - but the Irish government could still step in to veto any deal.

Aer Lingus is 25 per cent state-owned, despite the Irish government's promise to privatise it fully as part of the EU bailout deal struck in 2010.

Politicians are keen to safeguard the airline's 3,900 workers, most based in Dublin, as well as ensuring that there is no decrease in the number of flights between Ireland and London.

Deputy prime minister Joan Burton said yesterday: 'What we will want to do as a government, and what's absolutely important, is to protect these slots and the connections of direct flights in and out of Ireland.'

The country's opposition has called on the government to rule out any sale, while trade union IMPACT warned that a takeover would pose 'significant risk' to the Irish economy as a whole.

Another potential hurdle is Ryanair, Ireland's budget short-haul carrier, which owns a 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following a series of unsuccessful attempts to buy the airline outright.

Chief executive Michael O'Leary, known for his outspoken manner and aggressive attitude towards his customers, said last week he was open to considering a bid for Ryanair's stake.

Aer Lingus shares rose by 3.8 per cent this morning, peaking at €2.44, while shares in IAG were up by 3.5 per cent.
