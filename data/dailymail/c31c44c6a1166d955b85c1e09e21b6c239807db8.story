Three unidentified green shapes slowly rotate as they hover in the night sky over Wittenberge in Germany.

As two triangular objects approach each other, they appear to be repelled as if opposite ends of a magnate.

Suddenly, and without warning, one of them shoots off to the right at fantastic speed in an explosion of light, after apparently veering too close to its twin, which quickly fades to nothing. All that is left is a green circular dot.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The truth is out there: Could these images finally prove the existence of Unidentified Flying Objects?

Could this finally be proof that we are not alone and UFOs do really exist? Probably not, according to former FBI special agent Ben Hansen.

Mr Hansen,Â the lead investigator on Syfy Channel's Fact or Faked: 
Paranormal Files series, told the Huffington Post that the objects in were 'too defined'.

He said: 'The video has signs of night vision 
fakery. It looks like they added a night vision video effect with a 
green tint and even some "grainy noise" - the sparkling pixels which 
are common when night vision is shot in near complete darkness.

'Even if they were using older night 
vision technology, I would also expect the sky to be brighter and have 
more information for analysis.

'Even with the best technology, a 
slight halo effect is detected. All of this is consistent with a CGI 
effect being added (to the Germany video), instead of filming with true 
night vision.'

The identity of the person who made the video is unknown, leading Mr Hansen to further doubt its authenticity.

He claimed that because videos such as this get re-posted so frequently, it is often impossible to figure out the identity of the person who recorded it.

He added: 'This
often makes the Internet a hoaxer's amusement park. They don't have to 
answer questions. They don't have to provide further details. This means they don't have to be very good liars.'

Mr
Hansen also managed to track down a second version of the footage, 
which he believed suggested the hoaxer behind it was testing to see 
which version got the most views.

The video was posted to YouTube by UFOFilesTV, which describes itself as 'a new kind of UFO agency on YouTube'.

The group has no doubt that the footage, captured on September 18 using a full zoom and night sight capability, is the real deal.

Attached
to the video, the group has written: 'The filmer cannot explain this. 
He watched these UFOs... three 3 minutes before he got his camera.

'We
at the UFOFilesTV know these forms, or rather these lights, of older 
sightings in Belgium. These UFOs are also known as TR-A or TR3-B.

'Apparently they originate from the US Air Force but nobody could verify this so far.'
