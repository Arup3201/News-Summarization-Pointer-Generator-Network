He is only 32 years old but, like many men, Prince William is already suffering significant hair loss.

Now a leading hair transplant surgeon has claimed Prince William will be almost completely bald by his 50th birthday.

Asim Shahmalak, 53, has drawn up new graphics which show how the future King will look in just 28 years - without his crown.

The imagined difference between Harry now (left) and aged 50 (right) is startling

The odds are very much stacked against 
the 32-year-old royal and his brother, Prince Harry, 29, as the Windsor 
family has a history of baldness.

Their grandfather, Prince Phillip, 93, father, Prince Charles, 65 and uncle, Prince Edward, 50 are all bald.

They also have baldness on their mother’s side, Princess Diana’s father, the late Earl Spencer, had very thin hair.

New superimposed images of the two Prince’s show how they could look in the next two decades, with shocking results.

But there is a solution according to Dr Shahmalak, who is a hair loss expert on the popular Channel 4 TV show, Embarrassing Bodies.

The doctor, from Crown Clinic in Manchester said: 'There is a strong baldness gene in the royal family which has very obviously been passed down to Prince William.

It is already affecting Prince Harry who is starting to show the first signs of thinning hair around his crown.

'The only long-term cure for baldness is a hair transplant.

'I fear that it is too late for Prince William, who has too large an area of baldness to cover.

The two princes also have baldness on their mother's side, Princess Diana's father, the late Earl Spencer (right, with his daughter on her wedding day to Prince Charles), had very thin hair

'But if his hair loss accelerates, Prince Harry would really benefit from a hair transplant.

'He could look 10 years younger with the right procedure.'

Dr Shahmalak is famous for his work with celebrities and has carried out two hair transplants on Doctor Christian Jessen, star of Embarrassing Bodies, who said he was delighted with the work.

Dr Jessen said: 'The new hair has really boosted my confidence. I find doing photo shoots much more bearable.'

Celebrities like Wayne Rooney (left) and Robbie Williams have had hair transplants

Statistics show that 50 per cent of men have started shedding their locks by the time they reach 50 - and an even greater number have some strands of grey in their hair.

Increasing numbers of men are turning to hair transplants to prevent baldness.

Robbie Williams recently had a hair transplant just prior to his 40th birthday after he started thinning around his temples and 28-year-old Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney's two hair transplants prompted record numbers of men under-30s to go under the knife to save their hair.
