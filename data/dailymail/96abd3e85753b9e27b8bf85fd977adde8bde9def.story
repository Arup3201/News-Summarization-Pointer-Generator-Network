Kirstie Trup, who was attacked in Zanzibar

A British teenager badly burned in an acid attack in Zanzibar has vowed to return to the country to resume her voluntary work - and help find her attackers.

Kirstie Trup, 18, had a skin graft last month, just days after she and her friend Katie Gee, also 18, were splashed with battery acid on the Indian Ocean island off Africa.

They were left with burns on their faces, chests and hands.

Despite her ordeal, Kirstie cherished her time helping underprivileged children and wants to carry on the voluntary work next year.

She said: 'This experience, as horrible as it has been, has not deterred me from wanting to do more voluntary work in Zanzibar. In fact I would even like to return to do more work there next year.

'I am very determined to overcome my injuries and aid the investigation as much as possible.'

Miss Trup, from North London, is frustrated her assailants have not been caught after she gave police a detailed description of the attack in Stone own, the old part of Zanzibar City.

She told the Sunday Times: 'It doesn't make sense that our attackers haven't been caught. Stone Town is a small place and everyone knows everyone.'

She suffered severe burns to her shoulder and back after the sulphuric acid was thrown at her by one of two men on a moped as she and Katie walked home from a restaurant.

Three locals helped Miss Trup into the sea to help stop the burning, but she had to have a skin graft  on August 15 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after being flown home.

She is being treated three times a 
week as an outpatient while Miss Gee is thought to be still in hospital 
with more serious injuries.

Miss Gee, from Hampstead in London, suffered burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her torso.

The teenagers had been in Zanzibar for almost a month teaching 
English to underprivileged children as part of an Art in Tanzania community project when they were attacked.

Miss Trup described the man who threw the acid as being very dark with a shaved head, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans. Both men smiled just moments before the attack.

She told the paper: 'For me there are alot of unaswered questions and catching these people would go a long way to answering them.'

The Zanzibar authorities are 
understood to have a possible suspect fitting the description after 
interviewing a number of people.

Mussa Ali Mussa, Zanzibar’s 
commissioner of police, said the girls could help with identification of
suspects or any future trial.

Speaking
to the Evening Standard, he said: 'It will depend on the circumstances 
of the investigation (but) yes, we shall ask them. We shall contact the 
UK authorities.'

Zanzibar’s police have said a third 
British woman was sent threats apparently from the same attackers. The 
unnamed 29-year-old insisted she would not stop her charity work on the 
island.

Care: The two teenagers were both taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after returning to the UK

'Beyond imagination': The teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital

Just
before she had the skin graft, Ms Trup learned she got the A-level 
grades she needed to study history at Bristol University.

Miss
Gee also achieved the grades she needed to go to university, tweeting: 
'On the plus side I'm off to Nottingham!", where she will do sociology.
