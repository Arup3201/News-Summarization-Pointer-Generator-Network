Motorways are to become ‘electric superhighways’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery-powered cars.

‘Supercharging stations’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year, enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is fitting the devices, which can charge the Tesla electric cars his company makes in 20 minutes, giving a range of 130 miles.

This is far faster than most current electric cars, which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles.

It means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across Britain without concerns about running out of power, known as ‘range anxiety’.

The first network will stretch from Dover to London along the M20, cover the entire M25 and follow the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham.

Tesla declined to say which service stations would be used, but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the South Mimms services at the junction of the M25 and the A1 in Hertfordshire.

The network will also expand across much of Europe to enable owners to take the Channel Tunnel and drive on the Continent.

Tesla hopes motorists will be able to take its cars from northern Norway to southern Spain by the end of 2014.

Drivers will be able to get a range of 240 miles for 40 minutes charging or 300 miles for 75 minutes charging with a Tesla Model S Performance Plus car, which costs £70,000.

Electric cars are becoming more popular in Britain, but sales have been held back by a lack of charging points

Motorists do not have to wait with the car while it is charging. Tesla drivers will have unlimited access to the network for either a one-off fee or included in the top price of the cars.

Mr Musk was announced as the Government’s ‘electric car tsar’ in November. Despite efforts by the Government’s Office for Low-Emission Vehicles, which has £900million of taxpayers’ cash to play with, electric cars have so far failed to spark much interest in the British motoring market.

Only 1,547 pure electric cars were registered in Britain from January to April this year, just 0.18 per cent of total car sales.

A major drawback has been problems for motorists who are trying to find a public charging point on the street or at a supermarket and making sure they have the right cable for it.

Edmund King, president of the AA, said that Tesla could be a ‘game changer’ for the top end of the market.

He said: ‘The car looks good and is desirable. If it can be partially charged in 20 minutes and has a 300-mile range, then it should satisfy 98 per cent of drivers.’

Ecotricity and ChargeMaster are also expected to develop high-speed charging networks, but cars using them are not expected to have such a long range.

Elon Musk is known as the real-life Iron Man after he was said to have inspired Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of the genius inventor in the superhero films.

Mr Musk made his fortune with the online payment system PayPal, which he sold to eBay in 2002 for £1billion, using the proceeds to launch SpaceX, which has a £2billion contract with Nasa to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.

In 2003 he set up luxury electric car company Tesla, and last year unveiled a futuristic plan for a ‘Hyperloop’, a new type of transport that would send passengers in capsules along a tube at the speed of sound.

South African-born Mr Musk has five sons by his first wife Justine, whom he divorced in 2010.

He later married British actress Talulah Riley, star of the recent St Trinian’s films. The couple divorced in 2012 but have since reunited.

Miss Riley, educated at top girls’ school Haberdashers’ Aske’s, once said: ‘I fell in love with Elon because of our mutual love of physics.

I’m interested in philosophy, and talking to Elon I realised my questions could be answered with physics.’
