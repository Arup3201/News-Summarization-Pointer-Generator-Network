The man who brought the Cronut into the culinary world is back with yet another twist on a classic dessert.  

Created by chef Dominque Ansel, the new 'Pop It! Ice Cream Sundae in a Can' delivers exactly what it promises in a sealed and frozen confectionery creation which will be available for just one day on Aug. 2 from a 'Pop It!' ice cream truck in East Hampton.

City Harvest, a charity to feed the city's hungry with 'rescued' food from restaurants, groceries, and farms will collect 20 per cent of the profits.

Chef Dominque Ansel has created a 'sundae in a can' delivers exactly what it promises in a sealed and frozen confectionery creation which will be available for just one day on Aug. 2 from a 'Pop It!' ice cream truck in East Hampton

The sundae includes root-beer and stracciatella ice creams, mascarpone, semifreddo, macerated cherries, honey marshmallows, and cherry meringues within a soup can lined with chocolate

The Post reports the canned sundae will feature root-beer and stracciatella ice creams, mascarpone, semifreddo, macerated cherries, honey marshmallows, and cherry meringues within a soup can lined with chocolate.

'A regular sundae has a mix of textures because you’re assembling it 
to order, so some elements are frozen and some are not,' he said. 'But when you build a sundae in a can, the trick is to think of things 
that, when frozen, maintain a distinctly different texture.'

InStyle notes that the sweet innovation was created in partnership with designer Lisa Perry.

Ansel rose to fame with the creation of the cronut dessert

'Dominique was a perfect match for this collaboration, as both of our 
brands celebrate art, pop culture and fun,' she said. “He infuses each
 of his confections with creativity and imagination and the end result 
is always a treat in more ways than one!! I’m super excited for the 
delicious unveiling.'

The canned treat will run $15 per can.

Sugar junkies can find the truck selling them at Main Beach at 101 Ocean Ave. from noon to 1 p.m.

After 2 p.m. the truck will be located at the Lisa Perry East Hampton Store at 67 Main St.
