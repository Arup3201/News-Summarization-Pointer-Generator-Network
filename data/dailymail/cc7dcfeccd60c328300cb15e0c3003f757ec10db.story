The sister of Super Bowl-winning star Russell Wilson is following her brother into top-flight sport after being named in a U.S. basketball squad.

Anna Wilson has been selected for the 12-member roster for the USA 2014 Women's under-17 World Basketball Championship.

Miss Wilson said she was 'so excited' to be picked after enduring a sleepless night before the team was announced.

She said: 'Honestly, I was really, really nervous. I didn’t get much sleep last night, but when they called my name I was just very happy that it happened.'

The 5ft 7in player, who has committed to Stanford, said it was very special to have the chance to play for her country.

Speaking on the USA Basketball website, she added: 'That’s the best thing you could possibly do as an athlete to be able to represent your country, but as well represent my family and who I am.

'I’m so excited. I really have no words.'

Her brother Russell, who won the Super 
Bowl in February as a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, took to 
Twitter to express his joy at her selection.

He said: 'My baby sister will be wearing the red, white, and blue in Czech Republic!'

He later added: 'I'm pouring in tears about how blessed my sister is to make #TeamUSA @usabasketball on this special #MemorialDay.'

The team will hold a training camp in Colorado from June 12-17 before heading to France for an exhibition tournament.

They will then head to the Czech Republic for the world championships from June 28-July 6.

Carol Callan, chair of the USA Basketball Women's Developmental National Team Committee, which is responsible for selecting the players, said: 'Given the large numbers and the incredible talent at these trials, it was a challenge for the committee to make the decision.

'It's a very versatile team with good size, good speed and quickness and good basketball smarts.

'So, we are really excited to see how they perform at the world championship.'
