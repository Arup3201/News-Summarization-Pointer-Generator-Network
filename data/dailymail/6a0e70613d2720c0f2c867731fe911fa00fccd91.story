Killed: James Hunter, 18, was stabbed to death in a street fight in south-east London last night

Three teenage boys - one aged just 13 - have been arrested on suspicion of murder after an 18-year-old was stabbed to death last night.

The victim, named locally as James Hunter, was killed during a street fight in Sydenham, south-east London.

His brother could be heard screaming hysterically while paramedics battled unsuccessfully to save the teenager's life.

Three suspects, one aged 13 and the other two 15, are being questioned by police on suspicion of murder.

A 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of assault, while another 17-year-old who was also stabbed in the fight is currently in a stable condition in hospital.

Police and paramedics were called to the area around 8.30 last night, and Mr Hunter was declared dead at the scene an hour later.

A local resident whose flat overlooks the scene of the fight said that he saw the victim's brother yelling after paramedics arrived at the scene.

The witness said: 'He just kept shouting over and over, "That's my brother, that's my brother!"

'He was really upset, waving his arms around and screaming and kept putting his head in his hands.

'I saw the guy on the floor. There were people there doing CPR, but to me it just looked like the boy was dead.'

Neighbour Khloe Crowley said she saw Mr Hunter less than an hour before he died, and insisted he was not a troublemaker.

'He was just a quiet boy and we used to see him around here with his friends,' she said. 'He would just nod and say hello, but was never in any trouble or anything like that.

'It's very sad - his friends and family are going to have to walk past that spot every day and think of what has happened.'

Tribute: A bunch of flowers which was left at the scene in memory of Mr Hunter

Russell Taylor of the Metropolitan Police urged witnesses to the incident to come forward.

'A number of youths gathered in Wells Park Road before a fight broke out,' he said. 'Many people would have witnessed the attack as well as the aftermath.

'I would urge those people to contact officers so that we can piece together the events that led up to this murder.'

Clues: The Metropolitan Police are investigating a possible link to gang culture

A police spokesman said officers were investigating the possibility that the incident could have been gang-related.

Mr Hunter is the fifth teenager to have been murdered in London last year.

Anyone with information about his death should contact the incident room on 0208 721 4868 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
