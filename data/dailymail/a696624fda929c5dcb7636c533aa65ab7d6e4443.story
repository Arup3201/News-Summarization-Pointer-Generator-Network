Bafetimbi Gomis was given a clean bill of health on Thursday after revealing his shocking mid-game collapse was caused by the stress of his father’s ill health.

The Frenchman was discharged from hospital in London in the morning having fainted eight minutes into Swansea’s 3-2 defeat against Tottenham at White Hart Lane.

There were distressing echoes of Fabrice Muamba’s collapse at the same ground three years ago, with Spurs’ substitute goalkeeper Brad Friedel admitting he ‘feared the worst’ as he watched the striker slump to the ground.

But hospital tests through the night have found no deeper cause for concern beyond the 29-year-old’s vasovagal condition, which the Welsh club insist they have been aware of since before they signed the player from Lyon last summer.

A senior club source told Sportsmail that knowledge of at least three previous episodes involving Gomis in France meant they were ‘extra rigorous’ in testing him during his medical and cardiology exams. A source close to the player confirmed those tests took place in a specialist facility in Cardiff ahead of Gomis’s Bosman move to south Wales.

The Frenchman tweeted to insist he was feeling better, claiming he fainted because of the anxiety caused by his father’s illness.

He said: ‘I wanted to reassure you concerning my health. It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now.

‘I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father’s health, which requires me to go back and forth from France.

‘I was disappointed that I couldn’t help my team tonight (Wednesday), but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.’

The striker will not return to training until Tuesday, though the time off was agreed for the whole squad ahead of Wednesday’s incident, with Swansea not playing again until Monday week’s clash against Liverpool. He is expected to return to France imminently.

Club officials were adamant on Wednesday night that Gomis has suffered no previous issues with fainting since his arrival at the Liberty Stadium, though the dressing room had been made aware of a condition that is understood to have first affected the striker when he was 14. 

A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors.

Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety.

On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis’s history.

They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify.

It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer.

Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing.

Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down.

Most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments.

Gomis has a history of fainting and can be seen here collapsing during France national team training in 2009 

It has been reported in France that Gomis previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before this episode in training

It has been reported in France that he previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before it happened again in training for the France national team two months later. On each occasion he is understood to have resumed playing within 10 to 15 minutes of the episode.

Gomis is believed to have collapsed a third time in a Ligue 1 match for Lyon against Monaco in August 2010.

Such episodes are caused by low blood pressure to the brain, usually brought on by emotional or physical distress. Medical experts told Sportsmail that the main risks associated with the condition would come from falling, though Swansea claim Gomis is able to detect when a problem occurring and acts accordingly.

WHAT HAPPENED?

In one of his first games for Lyon, Gomis both scores and faints in a pre-season friendly. However his new club are not overly concerned.

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

Club doctor Emmanuel Ohrant said: ‘Since 14-years-old, Bafe has been the subject of such vasovagal episodes, comparable to a drop in blood pressure. At St Etienne, he used to faint. We got his whole medical file, and I can testify very exhaustive medical examinations have been

WHAT HAPPENED?

Gomis collapsed early in Lyon’s Ligue 1 home game against Monaco, just metres away from the home dugout. The striker was seen on the ground with his eyes rolled back before club doctor Emmanuel Orhant intervened.

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

However, Gomis quickly regained consciousness and continued playing until he was subbed off in the 76th minute. He later said: ‘I had an [incident] early in the game. I often do early in the season. I have immediately felt good after that. I think it was related to stress.'

Gomis also collapsed in a friendly match between Lyon and Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009

Friedel was in the stands when Muamba collapsed with a cardiac arrest and said: ‘Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately.

'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious.

'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right.

'It was something that had to be dealt with, of course, but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with Fabrice.’
