Three French workers stole 900,000 euros worth of treasure they discovered in a house they were working on in Normandy

A trio of French workers are to appear before a court on charges of theft after they stole a treasure trove of gold bars and coins from a house they were working on.

The loot, which they discovered in a house in Normandy, is estimated to be worth more than 900,000 euros ($1.2m) and was hidden in jars.

In a bizarre premonition, the owner of the house had jokingly told the workers: 'If you find any treasure, you tell me!'

According to a report in regional daily Paris Normandie, the jars contained six gold bars weighing a kilogram (2.2lbs) each, and 600 gold $20 coins from 1924 and 1927. It is thought they may have been hidden there during the Second World War.

Rather than alert the owner of the house to their discovery, the workers, aged 20, 33 and 40, decided to steal the treasure and sell it to a coin collector in the area.

But tax officials were alerted when one of the men began depositing high-value cheques.

When investigators caught up with them, the men confessed to their crime.

Police seized several vehicles, motorcycles and hundreds of thousands of euros from the workers as part of the investigation.

The three will appear at a court in Evreux, north west of Paris, at an unspecified date. The coin collector will also appear before the court on charges of trying to conceal the theft, which he denies.
