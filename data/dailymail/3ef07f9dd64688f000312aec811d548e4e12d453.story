Accused: NFL star Aaron Hernandez was confined to his cell when the play-off game was on

Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez who is currently in jail on a murder charge has been prevented from watching his team's play-off victory.

Tough rules at Bristol County House of Correction in Boston meant Hernandez was not allowed to watch the televised game.

He was confined to his cell when the crucial AFC Divisional Round match was on, Bristol Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson revealed.

Sheriff Hodgson told the Boston Herald: 'He's not allowed to watch any TV. It’s jail. It’s all about standards and sending a message.

'We only allow two hours a day of entertainment television.' 

Inmates are only allowed to watch self-help tapes and self-help documentaries, according to the strict prison guidelines.

Hernandez, who is prevented from mixing with other inmates due to his high-profile
 status, is allowed three hours exercised a day in a 12ft eight foot enclosure.

The 24-year-old is on remand in the high-security prison after being charged 
with murdering Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player who was found shot dead near his Massachusetts home in June.

Prosecutors claim that Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier.

In September, 2013, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to murder.

He is also now a suspect in the 2012 double-murder of two men outside a Boston night club.

Authorities believe that the June 17 
murder of Lloyd is in some way related to the double-murder of 
Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the 
Cure Lounge in Boston on July 16, 2012. 

The new developments in the case were detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court in Bristol, last month.

According to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder.

It previously has been reported that Hernandez, who was on a $40 million contract with the Patriots when he was charged, and his friends fought with Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting.

However, there is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant.

According to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave.

When the men left with their friends about 2.30am, the silver Toyota SUV pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire.

The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man.

The warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from the club taken the night of the murders.

Additionally, authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were related.

According to the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the connection between the three murders in front of him.

The combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder.
