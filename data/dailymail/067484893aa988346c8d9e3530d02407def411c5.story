Sales at Poundland have hit almost £1billion in the past year, thanks to a rise in middle-class shoppers moving away from big supermarkets towards smaller budget stores.

The firm, which opened its first shop in Burton-on-Trent in 1990, now has 528 outlets across the country.

Originally Poundland was shunned by affluent shoppers – but more than one in five of its customers now come from the wealthiest ‘AB’ group of families.

The company published its annual results yesterday, showing a sales increase of 13.3 per cent to £997.8million for the year to the end of March.

Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘Value is now a badge of honour for customers across the spectrum.’

And retail analyst David Alexander said: ‘The meteoric sales growth suggests Poundland is putting in foundations to drive single-price retail forward, even as austerity begins to fade.’

The growth came on the back of the opening of 60 new stores, taking the total to 528, while it plans to expand the empire further with a target of some 1,000 outlets.

The chain has effectively replaced Woolworths as the budget general store in towns and cities across the country with the result it has spawned a host of copycat rivals.

At one time, Poundland was shunned with the result protestors in well-heeled towns even got up petitions and campaigns to keep them out.

Middle-class shoppers: One fifth of Poundland's shoppers now come from the wealthiest 'AB' group of families. It has made an effort to attract middle income shoppers with a mix of more upmarket products and brands

The boss of Morrisons have described the change as the biggest shift in shopping habits since the big box supermarkets arrived in the 1950s.

Poundland has made a concerted effort to attract middle income shoppers with a mix of more upmarket products and brands, from grow your own veg ranges to gardening gloves and DIY items.

It operates more than 30 shops under the Dealz brand in Ireland and earlier this week extended the format to Spain with a store opening in Torremolinos.
