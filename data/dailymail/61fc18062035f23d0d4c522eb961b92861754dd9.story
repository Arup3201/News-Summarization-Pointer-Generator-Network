In a move that is being widely condemned, Texas gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott on Sunday thanked a supporter who tweeted that Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis is a 'retard Barbie'.

'@GregAbbott_TX would absolutely demolish idiot @WendyDavisTexas in Gov race - run Wendy run! Retard Barbie to learn life lesson,' read a tweet sent to Abbott from @Jefflegal, an Abbott supporter.

'Jeff, thanks for your support,' wrote Abbott, the current Republican Attorney General of Texas.

Davis is said to be considering a run at the Governor's office next year.

Abbott drew criticism from Democratic Governors Association representative Danny Kanner, who said in a statement to Politico:

'These disgusting attacks against Wendy Davis have no place in the political discourse and they say a lot more about the Republican men launching them than her.

'Clearly, they know that Wendy Davis offers the kind of real change that Texas voters want and are scared to death of her because of it.'

Davis has maintained a dignified silence on the matter.

Think before you tweet: The offending messages written by Abbott and Rutledge

Conservative: Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott is planning to run for the office of Texas Governor next year

Democratic State Senator Davis, who earlier this year gained national fame after mounting an abortion-related filibuster, would challenge Abbott if she decides to run for Texas governor.

The Senator has not yet announced her candidacy but has already been called 'abortion Barbie' by Redstate's Erick Erickson and 'retard Barbie' by Rutledge.

Twitter debacle: Jeffrey Rutledge wrote the offending tweet on his Twitter account, which is littered with references to 'godless jackasses' and 'retards'

Twitter feed: Rutledge's feed is an ongoing rant against liberal 'retards'

Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement to My San Antonio:

'That Greg Abbott would thank a supporter for calling Senator Wendy Davis a "Retard Barbie" is absolutely disgusting and disturbing. This is what Republicans think about women - that a Harvard law school graduate, State Senator, and a long time fighter for Texas families deserves such inappropriate slander.

'Greg Abbott endorses such disrespect. The people of Texas deserves so much better than this from their public officials. And the women of Texas deserve leaders who respect them as human beings.'

The author of the original tweet, Jeffrey Rutledge, is an attorney whose Twitter account is littered with the word 'retard' and snarky insults directed at liberals.
