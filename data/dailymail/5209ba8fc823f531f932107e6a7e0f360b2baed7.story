Romanians come second on the list of foreign nationals arrested by police for serious crimes, police have revealed.

Nearly 28,000 have been held for serious offences in London over the past five years, including violence and sex crimes.

That is the equivalent of 15 Romanians being held by the police every day. There are only estimated to be 68,000 living in the UK.

It puts Romania second only to Poland in the list of countries with the most citizens arrested in London – but there are around half a million Poles in Britain.

The figures have caused concern ahead 
of the dropping of border controls next year. From January, Romania’s 
21million inhabitants, along with seven million Bulgarians, will obtain 
free access to Britain.

Both countries have been members of 
the EU since 2007 but from January 1 their citizens will have full 
rights to live and work in the UK.

Critics of mass immigration have 
warned it could mean 50,000 arrivals every year for the first five years
 – the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle upon Tyne. Research 
suggests they would be eight times better off working in a minimum wage 
job here compared with staying at home.

27,725 Romanian nationals were arrested in connection with:

Sir Andrew Green, of Migration Watch 
UK, said: ‘It is a matter of real concern that there should be such a 
substantial degree of criminality among those Romanians who have already
 come to Britain despite the treaty limitations on their right to work.’

But Romania’s prime minister, Victor 
Ponta, has said his compatriots ‘will not rush’ to Britain next year. 
The figures on criminality among foreigners were released by Scotland 
Yard under the Freedom of Information Act.

Since 2008, 27,725 Romanian citizens 
have been held for serious offences in London. That includes ten for 
murder, 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences.

In the last five years, 34,905 Poles 
have been detained by the force, including 84 for murder. Lithuanians 
were the third most frequently arrested foreign nationals in the 
capital, with 18,594 being held.

A spokesman for the Romanian Embassy 
said only 624 Romanians were in prison in the UK. He added that the Met 
figures are for ‘suspects’ and that in many cases arrests will not lead 
to convictions.

Last April a family of Romanian pickpockets who stole to build ‘palaces’ in their homeland were jailed.

The Rostas family preyed on train 
passengers as they slept on late-night trains going out of London, 
stealing hundreds of mobile phones and cash. They also targeted tourists
 in the West End of London.

The family were living on benefits in 
Britain and pocketed hundreds of thousands of pounds by stealing from at
 least 185 victims over two years before selling on the phones in 
Romania for huge profits.

They built five mansions in Romania 
and also spent the proceeds of their crimes on designer clothing, gold 
jewellery and luxury cars.

Brothers Romulous Rostas, 18, and 
Marin Rostas, 25, their cousins Cornell Rostas, 22, and Govinder Rostas,
 17, and another family member, Robert Rostas, 23, admitted conspiracy 
to steal.

The adults received jail sentences 
ranging from three years and three months to 18 months, while Govinder 
Rostas was given a 12-month detention and training order.

Judge Peter Clarke, QC, expressed his shock at their ‘deep-rooted criminality’.
