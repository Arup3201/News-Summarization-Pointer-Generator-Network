A man died in a blaze after four firefighters failed to spot him during two searches of a burning building, an inquest heard today.

Danny Holt, 33, collapsed in his lounge after a chip pan caught fire - but the emergency services failed to spot him.

Both groups of firefighters assumed the other had searched the room in Eccles, Greater Manchester.

As a waiting ambulance drove off, a police officer shone a torch into Mr Holt's face by chance as the firefighters were reeling in hoses.

However, it was too late to save him and although he was rushed to hospital he was pronounced dead.

Mr Holt, a joiner, had returned home from a family Christening in the early hours of the morning on July 13, 2010, when the fire broke out.

Firefighter Rick Gregson went into the back of the house with his number two, Matthew Birch. Both were wearing breathing gear.

Find: PC Jill Jackson discovered Mr Holt by chance as her torch swept across the dark lounge

While Mr Gregson looked round the upstairs, Mr Birch searched the kitchen. He said he did not think it was necessary to search the lounge as he saw three firefighters wearing breathing apparatus in there.

Another firefighter, Russell Maden, also went into the front of the property with his number two Richard Newton.

But between the four of them, none of them spotted Mr Holt lying by the sofa.

PC Jill Jackson told the inquest in Bolton said it was only when she walked into the dark property for a second time that she stumbled across Mr Holt in the lounge.

'I just walked in the front room to find a telephone point, where a name and address book or contact book with names of family members might be,' she said.

'It was a little bit clearer in the house but it wasn't quite dawn out yet, I was using my torch.

'I shone my torch in the corner furthest from the front door where there might be a phone point.

'When I turned it, it shone directly in Mr Holt's face. He was against the far wall. His legs were covered from my view by the sofa.

'I could see the top of his body, he was against the wall as if he was sat on the floor.'

Danny's mother Linda told the hearing that if a proper search had been carried out he would have found.

The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow.
