The New Jersey high school cheerleader who lost a child support lawsuit against her parents has picked a college to attend next fall, bragging about winning a considerable scholarship in a Facebook post.

On Sunday, 18-year-old Rachel Canning announced that she would be attending Western New England University - a medium-sized, four-year, private university in Springfield, Massachusetts.

'Decision made,' Canning, a Morris Catholic High School senior, wrote as reported by NJ.com. 'WNE U class of 2018 [biomedical engineering] major w/ 56,000$ [sic] scholarship.'

Canning's scholarship is perplexing considering the estimated total cost of attendance is nearly $10,000 less than her award.

College bound: In a Facebook post on Sunday, 'spoiled' private-school girl Rachel Canning announced she would be attending Western New England University next fall

Brag: Canning wrote that she won a $56,000 scholarship to attend the medium-sized Massachusetts school even though tuition is just $47,560

Western New England University is a medium-sIzed, four-year, private college located in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The school was founded in 1919 under the original name of Western New England College, but was changed to a university in 2011.

U.S. News and World Report classifies the school as 'selective' with a 79 per cent acceptance rate.

The campus is majority-male with women accounting for just 39.4 per cent of the student body.

While there are over 60 clubs and organizations, there are no social fraternities or sororities on the campus.

Most of the students on campus live in college-owned or operated housing with less than 30 per cent living off campus.

WNEU has several sports team that compete on the NCAA division III level.

The most popular majors on campus include business, management and marketing with engineering majors (what Canning plans to study) accounting for 13 per cent of the student body.

According to the school's website, engineering students can expect to pay $47,560 a year to attend the school, an estimate that includes tuition, a student activities fee, services fee, and room and board.

Following news of Canning's decision, a spokesman for Western New England University issued a statement saying they cannot comment on any particular student but explained further their scholarship policies.

'To be clear, Western New England University routinely offers merit scholarships to incoming freshmen based on academic achievement. These scholarships range from $5,500 to $16,500 annually and are renewable for four years – as long as a student continually meets certain academic benchmarks.

'Therefore, these merit scholarships can total between $22,000 and $66,000 over the course of four years. These scholarships are awarded to all incoming freshmen who meet the academic criteria, independent of financial need.'

Canning made headlines last month after deciding to sue her parents Elizabeth and Sean Canning for child support and tuition when they kicked her out of the house for not obeying rules.

Rachel moved out of her parents' home in late October after her parents refused to pay her bills if she refused to accept their house rules and break up with her boyfriend.

In her lawsuit, Rachel had sought child support, private school and college tuition and payment of her legal bills.

But
 last week, the teenager returned home with her tail between her legs 
after she dropped the case, and she was pictured outside the home with 
her parents.

Though
 Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child
 support after kicking her out for failing to abide by their rules, she 
was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's 
lawyers and the judge himself.

'Have
 you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I 
don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said at a
 hearing last month.

He also warned he must consider the 'slippery slope' where 'we open the gates for a 12-year-old to sue for an Xbox, a 13-year-old to sue for an iPhone… what about a 15-year-old asking for a 60 inch TV?'

Following the dropped case, the lawyer representing Rachel's parents held a 
press conference confirming that the family had been reunited, but would not say what had sparked it.

'This is a long process, it's only the beginning,' Angelo Sarno said, according to the Daily Record. 'This
 is a private matter. It should have never been brought to the court's 
attention. It should have never been brought to the public.'

He added: 'It's ancient history, it's done... This is a happy situation.'

In shocking legal documents submitted 
to the court throughout the process, the honor-roll student said her parents’ behavior 
contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw 
her weight plummet. She also said that her father had 
an 'inappropriate affection' for her.

She argued that since her parents 
have a combined yearly income of between $250,000 and $300,000, she was 
entitled to $654-a-week in child support.

Her parents also refused to pay $6,000 owed in school fees for her Catholic High School.

A Department of Children and Families 
investigation cleared Mr Canning of any claims of abuse, with Rachel's 
parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion
 she was just 'spoiled'.

Her parents had claimed their daughter ran off 
to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by 
rules they had set down, including to stop dating her boyfriend.

The
 judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit. He said: 'What kind of 
parents would the Cannings be if they didn’t try to set down some strict
 rules?

Emotional: Both Sean and Elizabeth Canning began
 crying in the courtroom earlier this month as their lawyers explained that they had to enforce their rules with their often 
rebellious child

No cares: Rachel was seen 
with her friend Jaime Inglesino, whose family took her in and paid her legal fees

'I'm not going to put myself in anyone's shoes, he's (father Sean) trying to raise a child. It's clear to me all the positive qualities Rachel obviously has, in terms of sports and academics, but I’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks, to put it mildly.'

Through the hearings, it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the Homecoming dance because he thought she was drunk.

Judge
 Peter Bogaard also read an expletive-laden and vicious voice message left by
 Rachel to her mother, in which she said: 'I wanna s*** all over your 
face'.

Rachel’s
 controversial legal battle was funded by the father of her best friend,
 millionaire lawyer Jon Inglesino. The Cannings believed he enabled 
their daughter's behavior.
