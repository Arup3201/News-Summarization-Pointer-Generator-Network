The National Science Foundation has suspended a researcher after the organization discovered that the unnamed employee was using powerful, government-funded supercomputers to mine bitcoins, the popular virtual payment system, according to a government report published earlier this year.

The researcher's scheme was revealed in the agency's semi-annual report to Congress compiled by the NSF's Office of the Inspector General.

'We received reports describing a researcher’s abuse of NSF-funded 
supercomputing resources at two universities to conduct bitcoin mining 
activities,' the report said.

Miner: The NSF suspended a researcher who used government-funded computers to mine bitcoins

The benefits of mining bitcoins is described by Fox News as an 'alternative to buying bitcoins on an exchange.'

'The so-called "miners"
 are rewarded with the virtual currency for using their processing power
 to verify transactions, a task which requires significant compute 
resources. Because the cryptocurrency has no central authority or banks,
 transactions are managed and bitcoins are issued collectively across a 
peer-to-peer network.'

According to the report, the researcher misused more than $150,000 in supercomputing equipment. The bitcoins generated were valued between $8,000 and $10,000.

'Both universities determined that this was an unauthorized use of their IT systems,' the report states. 'The researcher asserted that he was conducting tests on the computers, but neither university had authorized him to conduct such tests.'

According to the report, the unnamed universities found that the researcher had accessed the supercomputers remotely in an attempt to conceal what he was doing. In one example, he accessed the computer through a 'mirror site' located in Europe.

In addition to the government-wide suspension, the NSF terminated the researcher's access to all NSF-funded supercomputers.

According to the Harvard Crimson, a similar mining of virtual currency was discovered at Harvard University earlier this year. 

In the Harvard case, a researcher was using the university's supercomputers to mine Dogecoin, a type of digital currency similar to bitcoin.
