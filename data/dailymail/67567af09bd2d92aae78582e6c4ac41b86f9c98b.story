He tells her that Siri doesn't like her voice, which causes Nonna Paola to lose it at her son.

'Why no like my voice I talk gently!' she yells.

'Because you very experience for this mobile phone, I'm no experience!'

She tries again, but Siri has trouble understanding her broken English.

'Hello you can tell me what's time it's in Italy please, thank you,' Nonna Paola asks.

Siri replies: 'I value you.'

Mr Lachimia then tries to wind up his mother by telling her to tell Siri to 'p*** off'.

But Nonna Paola quickly fires back: 'No! I no tell p*** off to the people.

'Shut up, you make me sick! No way!

In December, Mr Lachimia posted a video of Nonna Paola blowing up after his 12-year-old son told her he was getting a tattoo

That video got more than 4.5 million views, so he decided to create Facebook fan page for Nonna Paola which has almost 30,000 likes

'Listen you no have to be rude to the people, you understand!'

Nonna Paola then makes another unsuccessful attempt at asking Siri the time in Italy.

The application responds by saying: 'I see a handful of Italian restaurant in your area.'

Nonna Paola and Mr Lachimia burst out laughing when she repeatedly calls Siri 'Sira' by mistake.

The iPhone app then responds with a garbled answer, which causes Mr Lachimia to exclaim:

'You confused her, you confused the computer! That's unbelievable!'

But Nonna Paola is quick to yell back: 'You know what you drive me mad, you drive me crazy you d***head!'
