An Argentine zoo where tourists pose for photos inside lion cages could be shut down amid claims the animals appear drugged.

Visitors to Lujan Zoo in Buenos Aires boasted of having an up-and-close experience for just £25 - but outraged animal activists handed their social media photos to the government.

Now widespread reports suggest the zoo could be sanctioned or even shut down because the Argentine capital's laws prevent direct contact between people and wild animals.

Crackdown: Lujan Zoo in Buenos Aires, where tourists can take the ultimate photos inside lion cages (including those pictured in this article) could be shut down by authorities concerned at the practice

Tame: The zoo says its animals are domesticated, taught calmness techniques and fed before visitors arrive, but critics were doubtful - and said many of the animals appeared to be drugged or sedated during visits

Leonardo Mascitelli, an undersecretary at Buenos Aires' Directorate of Wildlife of the Ministry of Land Affairs, confirmed the zoo was being investigated. 

He said the contact was against Article 8 of a provincial law which bans 'direct animal contact with the public' in parks and estates where animals are exhibited.

His officials were sent social media photos by animal rights activists so sent inspectors - who were able to join the queues of dozens of tourists waiting to touch the animals. 

Mr Mascitelli added that he had asked for the 'maximum penalty' which could mean 'economic sanctions or closure'.

The zoo has around 400 animals and is said to offer a 'unique interacting experience' in which visitors can pet, stroke, cuddle and even sit on lions, tigers and brown bears. 

It insists the animals are raised with domestic animals such as dogs and a keeper is always on hand in case anything goes wrong.

One reviewer from New York wrote: 'To have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me'

It adds that the animals are fed prior to interacting with visitors 'so they won't feel hungry when a human is inside their cage'.

Zoo spokesman Neyen Rivero Longoria said: 'The animals are no more dangerous than domestic dogs because we have taught them the boundaries.

'We are the only zoo in the world that practices special training in gentleness techniques.'

But animal rights groups and some tourists rubbished the claims, including on the travel review site Tripadvisor.

One anonymous reviewer wrote: 'There was one lion unconscious lion passed out on a picnic table. When someone arrived for a photo, water was thrown on the clearly drugged lion's face and meat was dangled in front of it.'

Another wrote: 'Since I got there and saw the poor animals, I realised something was happening in there. It seems like these animals are drugged or sedated... It's just a matter of time until someone gets hurt, and who will be the one to blame?'

Hug: A Facebook group by activists calling for the zoo to be shut down has more than 6,000 members

Another, from Kansas, wrote: 'It was an amazing experience that I went into a bit naive. The animals are clearly drugged, especially the lions.

'However, they are taken care of and it was still terrifying to get to get in the cages with them to pet or feed them. You should just know what you are getting into.

'I definitely would have thought twice about going if I had realised the animals were going to be doped up.'

And a Buenos Aires native wrote: 'This zoo is inhumane and made my stomach turn the entire time I was there. Yes, you can get close enough to pet a tiger or ride a lion but the animals are obviously sedated and if you have ever seen these beautiful creatures in the wild it is obvious.'

A Facebook group called 'Close Lujan Zoo' now has more than 6,000 members.

Its founders wrote: 'We are against animal mistreatment and consider Lujan Zoo to be one of the worst zoos in Argentina. 'Many of the animals are sedated for the selfish enjoyment of people without conscience. Close Lujan Zoo!'

Controversy: Not everyone hated the zoo - and the vast majority of reviews on Tripadvisor were positive

Another visitor to the zoo boasted that a full experience cost only £25 including tips to staff inside the cage

Yet not everyone is against the zoo.

One visitor who reviewed on Tripadvisor said she was thrilled that the whole experience only cost £25 including tips.

And of the 1,800 Tripadvisors reviewers, only 130 said it was 'poor' or 'terrible', with more than half (960) saying their experience was 'excellent'. 

One reviewer from New York wrote: 'To have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me. I've loved them since I saw the tiger on the cover of my science book in high school. That experience definitely made up for the negative things we encountered at that zoo.'

Another from Arizona added: 'I would say it's not likely the animals are being sedated, but rather that they're well-fed and raised with dogs.'
