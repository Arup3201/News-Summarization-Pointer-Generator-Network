Both Dairy Queen and Kmart are the latest stores to be plagued with computer security breaches.

Dairy Queen said on Thursday that its payment systems were breached by hackers who may have gained access to customer names, credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates.

The ice cream and fast food chain says 395 of its stores around the country were affected. The data breach happened between August and September.

Customer alert: Retailer Sears Holdings Corp said the payment data system at its Kmart unit had been breached, and that certain debit and credit card numbers could have been compromised

Dairy Queen says it worked with law enforcement authorities and credit card companies to investigate the breach.

It says there's no evidence Social Security numbers, personal identification numbers or email addresses were accessed. The Edina, Minnesota-based company is offering customers free identity repair services.

Retailer Sears Holdings Corp said the payment data system at its Kmart unit had been breached, and that certain debit and credit card numbers could have been compromised.

The data hacking at Kmart discount stores comes after a slew of data breaches at U.S. companies over the last two years.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that personal data from 83 million households and small business accounts were exposed when computer systems at JPMorgan Chase & Co were compromised, making it one of the biggest data breaches in history.

Kmart, which launched an investigation into the hacking, apologised to its customers on Friday and said it was working with federal authorities, banking partners and security firms in the probe.

Sears, whose shares were little changed in extended trading, said there was no evidence that kmart.com had been compromised.

The investigation, which indicates the breach began in September, revealed that no personal information, debit card PIN numbers, email addresses and social security numbers were obtained by the hackers.

Bond insurer MBIA also reported a server breach this month that compromised the data of thousands of local U.S. government entities.  

Other widespread breaches include those of Target Corp, Home Depot Inc, Michaels Stores Inc and Neiman Marcus.

A number of retailers, including Home Depot, Target and Michael's have been the target of cyberattacks in the past year.
