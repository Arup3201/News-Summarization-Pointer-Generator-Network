Thousands of court cases could soon be dealt with over the internet under new proposals which aim to reduce the amount of time and money spent on conventional hearings.

Online courts could be created to resolve low-value disputes about internet services and transactions, if the HM Courts and Tribunals Service gives the plans the go-ahead.

The idea to 'increase access to justice' has been proposed by the Civil Justice Council and is backed by Lord Dyson, the master of the rolls, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales.

The online court would resolve claims worth up to £25,000 and could be based on existing services such as eBay's disagreement negotiation procedure, the plans reveal.

It would allow judges to decide cases online after analysing paperwork submitted via email, with an option of telephone hearings or Skype calls if necessary.

According to the Civil Justice Council, the current system of resolving disputes in a physical court is too costly, too complex and too slow.

Funding from the project could come from the £75million budget the Ministry of Justice wants to spend each year on modernising technology within HMCTS, the council's report said.

Professor Richard Susskind, president of the Society for Computers and Law who wrote the Civil Justice Council report, suggested ideas such as 'automated negotiation' to resolve differences 'without the intervention of human experts'.

His report states: 'ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) is not science fiction. Each year on eBay around 60 million disagreements amongst traders are resolved through ODR. 

'This is a well-established way of resolving disputes, appropriate for the internet age.

'Other jurisdictions, notably Holland and Canada, are already forging ahead. If we aspire to have a court system that leads the way, then we already have some catching up to do.'

Professor Susskind, who discussed the working group's report at a conference in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, added that the proposed changes could also save money.

He said: 'If a large number of disputes come to be resolved by HMOC, this would have significant implications for the court estate. There will be a reduction in need for many of the current buildings and the land on which they sit.

'The current system is too costly, too complex and too slow, especially for litigants in person.

'We call for support from all the political parties for [online courts] that will reduce costs and increase access to justice.'

Lord Dyson, the second most senior judge in England and Wales, welcomed the proposals and said the justice system had been slow to take advantage of internet technology.

He said: 'I see this as an exciting milestone in the history of our civil justice system.

'We have been very slow off the mark in this country in taking advantage of technology in our justice system. Other countries are way ahead of us.

'There is no doubt that online dispute resolution is an area with enormous potential.

'Its aim is to broaden access to justice and resolved disputes more easily, quickly and cheaply.

'The challenge lies in delivering a system that fulfils that objective.'

An HMCTS spokesman said: 'We welcome publication of this important and thought-provoking report.

'We agree that Online Dispute Resolution is an important area and one that we are actively exploring in more detail in the context of the reform of court and tribunal services.'

The proposal for the creation of an online court comes five months after a senior judge called for courts to cut down on paper and move into the digital age.

In September, Lady Justice Gloster, who sits in the Court of Appeal, said the numbers of bundles of documents used in trials were similar to when she started her legal career four decades earlier.

The 65-year-old judge said, in an interview with financial news agency Bloomberg, that change had to come.

Earlier in 2014, the Ministry of Justice said changes were planned.

In March, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said technology in courts would be updated, adding that hundreds of millions of pounds would be spent in coming years.
