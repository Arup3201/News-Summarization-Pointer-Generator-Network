She spent most of the winter so far in Massachusetts, lingering around the waters of Cape Cod.

But on Saturday, Katharine  - a 2,300 pound great white shark that is being tracked by research team Ocearch - reared her head just north of Jacksonville, and appears to be heading south searching for warmer climes.

Fortunately for Floridians, Katharine's whereabouts can be checked online.

She's back: Katharine the great white shark has returned to the waters off Florida less than a month after being clocked leaving  Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where she has been all season

Here she comes: Katharine, who sends a radio signal every time she surfaces after being implanted with a transmitter, pinged off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, on Saturday afternoon

Due south: On Friday, Katharine pinged near Fernandina Beach, right at the Georgia-Florida border

Katharine, who is 14 feet long, sends a signal every time she surfaces as part of a pioneering programme to show shark movements live online. 

Katharine is one of a group of great whites that  Ocearch have been following.

The sharks are tagged with a transmitter and the research groups use radios to follow them.

One of the others, Mary Lee, who at 3,456 pounds is much larger than Katharine, likes to stay in far-out Atlantic, keeping off Georgia and the Carolinas, according to WJCL News.

But Katharine likes to travel up and down the east coast throughout the year, often passing through Mary Lee's territory.

Katharine was first tagged on August 20, 2013.

Transmitter: Katharine has wondered the east coast since she was tagged on August 20, 2013

Signal: The transmitter allows research groups like Ocearch to track Katharine when she surfaces

In the first 10 months, she traveled over 5,000 miles. 

The tags can last up to five years.

Having spent most of the season in Cape Cod, many thought Katharine might stay there.

She has even gone as far north as the southern coast of the panhandle.

However as the Massachusetts waters got holder she made a sharp journey south, according to The Inquisitr.

Within  days Katharine was in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and came so close to shore she startled locals. 

Traveler: In the first 10 months of her tracking, she traveled over 5,000 miles

Then on Thursday, Katharine and Mary Lee were quite close to each other, before Katharine turned up in north Florida Saturday.

It will be interesting to see whether Katharine revisits the route she took last year, when she traveled all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. 

The largest ever recorded great white was 21 feet long. 

Revisiting?: Last year he shark was first spotted near Miami, passing close to Key west before going to the Gulf

Route: In June last year, Katharine was clocked off the coast of Florida, heading towards Texas
