Manchester City will not be reporting Neymar to UEFA after he appeared to be involved in an altercation with one of their supporters.

The Brazil captain became embroiled in a verbal spat with a City fan after he was substituted with 10 minutes to play in Barcelona's 2-1 last-16 Champions League victory at the Etihad Stadium.

Video footage shows Neymar react to the supporter who had shouted at him in Portuguese.

Things appeared to have cooled off but after the final whistle the Barca star returned to argue with the fan before stewards intervened.

Sportsmail understands City are aware of the incident but do not feel that it is serious enough to warrant making a complaint to the governing body.

The supporter, wearing a City shirt with Yaya Toure's name and No 42 on the back, appeared to indicate that Neymar had been diving during the game.

As the 23-year-old approached the fan, the man wearing a hoodie under his replica shirt made repeated hand gestures.

While one steward intervened to keep the pair apart another security official sternly repeated 'Stop it, stop it.' 

The same fan had earlier taunted Neymar and the Barcelona  bench after Lionel Messi's missed penalty

After the game Neymar attempted to play down the incident.

He was quoted in the Brazilian media saying: 'I was just playing with him. He began to curse me and I ended up mocking him.'

The striker would not reveal what exactly was said in the altercation, but hinted that the fan swore at him.

'What he told me? I can not repeat it, no,' he joked. 'My mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me.'
