Frank Lampard faces being jeered by some sections of the New York City FC fanbase when he finally arrives at the MLS club.

Supporters had bought season-tickets and shirts on the back of Lampard’s summer unveiling and news that he will not be joining them until July – and that he never signed a playing contract in the first place – has not been well received.

Chance Michaels - president of The Third Rail supporters group – told Sportsmail: ‘The whole situation is very frustrating.

Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard

City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move 

‘If we’d known all of the details from the start then we would not be as upset as we have been this past week. All of this could have been easily avoided.

‘But we have a problem with transparency in the MLS in general and I feel for Lampard being caught in the middle of it.’

Third Rail co-founder Anthony Buckley added: ‘It comes down to how they presented it – he was wearing the shirt and we were told he was definitely going to play.

‘Then we were told he was staying at Manchester City and now that he had never signed at all.

‘We’re confident he’ll still come here to play but some fans have already taken back shirts with his name on and say they’re going to boo him.

‘Personally, I won’t be doing that because I'm putting my heart 100 per cent behind this new team, but the reaction has been very mixed towards him and this situation.’

Michaels, meanwhile, understands why some fans feel aggrieved.

‘Clarity is the big issue here and some fans feel they’ve been lied to – be that by the league, the club or the player, so I understand why some people want to show their feelings when he does play,’ he said.

‘But the fact there was no contract does not bother me and I think Lampard’s statement was very clear and seemed pro New York City FC.

‘We just hope all of this is sorted and he does come to play here in July.’

I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. 

When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting January 1 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.

This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.

I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. 

Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!
