Here's more bad news for people with a sweet tooth. Not only can excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity, it can also make you look old too.

A diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness. Nutritionist Brooke Alpert and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris explain why in their new book, The Sugar Detox.

They write: 'So, do people who eat too much sugar really look older? The answer is a resounding YES! In a large study published in the journal AGE, 602 people were examined by independent evaluators.

Moment on the lips, lifetime on the face: Too much sugar can prematurely age your skin

'Healthy people with lower blood sugars 
typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars,
and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age.'

They explain: 'Too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin: Simply put, it makes skin unhealthy. Skin is our largest organ; one of its main functions, called barrier function, is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution, dirt, bacteria, and fungi.

'Anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections. Some very interesting recent studies have shown that long-term hyperglycemia (too much sugar in the blood) leaves skin more vulnerable.

'This explains why diabetics and others with long-standing hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin. This is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin.'

The pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age, making it wrinkly and saggy, and poor nutrition can accelerate this process.

But they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan.

As previously reported in the MailOnline, the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar. On the low carb plan, dairy, fruit (with the exception of lemon and lime), starches, wheat and any added sugars are all banned. Some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses.

The pair say going 'cold turkey' for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar.

The foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body - and especially for the skin. For example, they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production.

Turn back the clock: Swap coffee with added sugar for green tea

Process in a blender:

Apply a thin layer of the mixture to your face, leave on for ten minutes then wash off with warm water.Why
it works: The yogurt contains exfoliating lactic acid, oatmeal is a 
natural anti-inflammatory, honey has healing properties and acts as a 
natural moisturizer, and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants.

At meal times they recommend 
regularly consuming fish high in Omega 3 such as salmon. This is because
they contain essential fatty acids that are 'the building blocks for 
the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated.'

When
it comes to drinks, their superhero product for the skin is green tea -
which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers. They also 
recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under
eye bags and puffiness.

They
explain why it's so good for helping the skin look more youthful: 
'Studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively 
blocks collagen cross-linking and inhibits AGE accumulation associated 
with ageing.

'Green tea can also be prepared as an extract for use in cosmeceutical skin care. Topical green tea extract protects against UV-induced inflammation and oxidative stress, making it a powerful, topical skin care agent. Using skin-care products containing GTPs is an excellent way to inhibit collagen glycation and protect skin from damaging UV rays.'

Read all about it: The Sugar Detox is available to buy as an ebook

As they are aware many will find the three day detox difficult, the book also includes DIY beauty treatments you can do at home over the three days to boost your mood and rejuvenate your skin.

Their spa treatments include a sea mud mask, an 'ancient beauty bath', i.e. one where you soak in bathing salts, and a 'moisturising antioxidant mask'. This can either be bought in the shops (they provide a list of recommended products) or made yourself using their recipe (see pink box above, right).

The aim of the treatments is to make people feel better with some pampering as they detox but also give their skin a head start on recovery before the benefits of the new diet kick in.

Beyond the three day pampering, the pair outline a skincare regime that people should follow in tandem with their diet plan to look and feel good on the inside and out.

They guarantee people who follow their advice will notice a difference in the appearance of their skin which will look younger and healthier. What could be sweeter than that?
