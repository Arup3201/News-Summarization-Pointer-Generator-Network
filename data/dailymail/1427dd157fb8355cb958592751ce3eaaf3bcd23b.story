A boy had to be treated by his own mother after he was taken to hospital when a firework hit him in the chest setting fire to his jumper.

Amy McCabe was on duty at Yorkhil Hospital, Glasgow, when Ben, four, was taken to A&E following a display outside their home in Cumbernauld.

A rocket misfired, hitting him in the chest, setting his shirt on fire and causing severe burns.

Amy McCabe was on duty when her son, Ben, was brought in with third degree burns

Ben's body is now covered in scars from where the firework burned his flesh after getting stuck in his coat

'It was horrific,' said Mrs McCabe. 
'Watching sick children come in is hard enough, but there's no bigger 
shock than when it's your own child.'

Ben underwent seven skin grafts and is now fronting a campaign against non-official firework displays.

Husband
Alan, 39, family and neighbours had gathered to set off some fireworks.
Everyone was kept at a safe distance, but in a freak accident one fired
into Ben's jacket.

'Nobody could see where the rocket had gone,' Amy said. 'The next minute Ben started screaming. We can't understand how it happened but the firework went inside his coat and set his shirt on fire.'

Mr McCabe wrapped Ben in wet blankets until an ambulance arrived. But by the time he arrived at hospital, the intense heat had burned through his skin.

He was rushed to theatre where doctors discovered third degree burns on his neck, chest and behind his left ear. Surgeons performed seven skin grafts to mend the damage.

Ben spent three weeks in hospital, after contracting MRSA - a common infection in burns victims.

When he was eventually allowed home, he needed to be treated with creams and have his dressings changed four times a day..

The firework display was outside Ben's house where he with family and friends

'We
soon realised Ben was very fortunate,' Mrs McCabe, who is now a dental 
technician, recalled. 'Thankfully the burns hadn't affected his 
respiratory system.'

'His burns are looking better every day.'

The family were supported by the Scottish Burned Children's Club, run voluntarily by firefighter Mark Stevenson.

'The SBCC has allowed Ben to spend time with other victims, and get a break from feeling 'different'.

'His confidence has improved tenfold,' Mrs McCabe said

Now Ben, 6, has agreed to front the charity's campaign warning of non-official firework displays.

SBCC is also lobbying the Scottish Government to change the law so people would have to prove they've completed a course on using fireworks safely before buying them.

Amy said: 'Having fireworks banned from retailers altogether would be ideal, but regulating who can buy them is the next best thing.

'We'll never forget what happened - and never stop fighting to prevent it happening to someone else.'
