Michelle Obama shared a tender moment with a young children's rights activist as the President's three-day state visit in India ended today.

The First Lady was seen hugging 14-year-old Payal Jangid while her husband, President Barack Obama, met with Nobel Peace Prize winner and anti-child labor activist Kailash Satyarthi.

After their last day of their India-visit the President and Mrs Obama offered a traditional greeting before stepping onto Air Force One this afternoon and setting off for Saudi Arabia.

The President and the First lady met Nobel Prize winner Satyarthi and his wife, who were accompanied by three children they met through their work.

Mr and Mrs Obama spoke to a 12-year-old boy rescued from a button factory, an eight-year-old boy who lost a finger as a farm worker and activist Miss Jangid.

Miss Jangid, who has advocated for clean drinking water in schools and works against child marriages, was given a warm hug by the First Lady when they met in New Delhi.

The 14-year-old is a World's Children's Prize jury member and leader of the Child Parliament in her village in rural Rajasthan, a part of India plagued by poverty where child brides are not uncommon.

In his speech following the meeting with Satyarthi and the young activists, the U.S. President highlighted the need for gender equality in modern society.

Important words: President Barack Obama addressed issues of gender equality and minorities in his speech at the Siri Fort Auditorium in Delhi

'Every woman should be able to go about her day - to walk the street or ride the bus - and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves,' President Obama told the audience  at the Siri Fort Auditorium, a government-run event center in New Delhi.

A horrific gang rape on a moving bus in the heart of New Delhi in 2012 sparked public protests, which prompted more stringent laws. But critics say more progress is needed and the President gave voice to their cause.

'Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people and that includes our women,' he said.

President Obama also praised his wife during his speech, noting that he is married to a strong woman who is not afraid to speak her mind.

Since taking office in May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often talked about women's rights, urging Indians to treat sons and daughters equally. 

He recently launched an 'educate the daughter, save the daughter,' program to stem sex selective abortions that skews the gender ratio toward boys and to encourage parents to educate girls, who are often considered a burden. 

The President said that while he has had extraordinary opportunities, 'there were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin.'

As he touted the importance of religious tolerance, he noted the persistent false rumors that he is a Muslim, not a Christian.

'There have been times where my faith has at times been questioned by people who don't know me, or they've said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing,' Obama said.

Equality is enshrined in India's constitution, but religious minorities and women have experienced harassment and violence.

India is largely Hindu, with almost 80 percent following the faith. At over 12 percent Muslims are India's largest minority, with Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists making up the rest. 

While religious groups largely coexist peacefully, the country has seen several flare ups of violence, primarily between Hindus and Muslims.

Obama said no society is immune from man's darkest impulses, as he raised the 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin that killed six people.

 'In that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we must again today, that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination,' Obama said.

Modi was denied was denied a visa to the U.S. in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official. 

He has denied any wrongdoing and India's top court says it found no evidence of Modi's involvement in the riots, but India's Muslims and Christians are wary of Modi's right wing Bharatiya Janata Party.

Obama's speech was the closing to a three-day visit to celebrate India's Republic Day, the anniversary of India's democratic constitution taking force in 1950. 

He cut out Tuesday's plans for a visit to the Taj Mahal, India's famed white marble monument of love, to add a stop in Saudi Arabia on the way home to pay respects to the royal family following King Abdullah's death.
