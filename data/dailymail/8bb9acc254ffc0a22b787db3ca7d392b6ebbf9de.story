A New Orleans teacher who had a three-month relationship with a 17-year-old student at the Catholic girl's high school where she worked was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday.

Jeannine Seoane, 48, was a teacher at Archbishop Chapelle High School in Metairie when she embarked on the affair with the student.

The mother of two girls pleaded guilty to prohibited sexual contact between an educator and student and to unlawful purchase of alcohol for a person under 21.

Confessed: Jeannine Seoane admitted to 'lewd and lascivious' contact with a teenaged girl

Judge Ellen Kovach suspended jail time and instead sentenced Seoane to two years probation, 100 hours of community service and making monthly visits to a psychiatrist.

According to The Times-Picayune, Seoane has been barred from contacting the teen, who is now 19, in person or through social media.Â 

She also must register as a sex offender and child predator for 15 years, but her attorney Mark Shea said he is considering challenging the order as 'cruel and unusual punishment'.

According to The Times Picoyune, Assistant District Attorney Jeff Hufft described Seoane's behavior as 'acts of lewd and 
lascivious conduct' and genital touching. Seoane also provided alcohol 
to the victim

Confidante: The mother of two girls became close with the 17-year-old, who would confide in her about her parents' marital problems

Seoane was a social studies teacher at the Metairie 
girls high school. She was arrested in March last year and put on leave 
by the school immediately.

The Times-Picayune reports that Judge Kovach told Seoane: 'Your selfish, obsessive behavior has inflicted a lot of harm.'

Seoane's affair with the student lasted from December 2011 until March 2012, and testimony by the victim's parents indicated Seoane became obsessed with the girl.

According to the The Times-Picayune, the victim's mother told the court that the teacher seemed to stalk her daughter, driving past their home and communicating with her via social media.

She said the idea of the events involving her daughter and the 48-year-old mother 'mortifies and sickens me 
every day.'

'I felt I didn't do enough to protect my daughter,' the teen's father testified at the trial.

Trusted: Seoane was a teacher at a local girls high school

The daughter, who is now a college student, also gave testimony that Seoane preyed on her, saying she isn't gay and that her confidante had betrayed her.

'She used my vulnerability to seduce me,' the teenager told the court, saying that she talked to the teacher about her parents' marriage problems.

Gossip about the girl's relationship with the high school teacher spread around the school, and the victim found herself the subject of gossip, being called the 'Seoane girl'.

The Times-Picayune reports that the girl told court she entertained thoughts of suicide.

'My bedroom and my bed were my best friends,' she said. 'That's
where I felt most comfortable.'
