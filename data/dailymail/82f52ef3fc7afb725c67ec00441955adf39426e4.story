British artist Jane Perkins, a self-described 're-maker,' uses discarded plastic objects to re-create iconic portraits, including those of the Mona Lisa, Michael Jackson, Albert Einstein and the Royal Family.

'I use anything of the right size, shape or color,' the full-time mother, artist and former nurse, based in Exeter, Devon, writes on her website. 'Toys, shells, buttons, beads, jewelry, curtain hooks and springs, etc.'

Ms Perkins browses charity shops and yard sales tirelessly to find objects which will fit into her work, much like pieces to a jigsaw puzzle, and none of the items are painted to alter their color. 'Everything is used exactly 'as found,' she maintains.

Beady eyed: British artist Jane Perkins, a self-described 're-maker,' uses discarded plastic objects to re-create Old Master paintings and iconic portraits, including this, based on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, c.1610

Ms Perkins, whose current body of work is called Plastic Classics, started making her portraits eight years ago, after 17 years of working as a nurse and then ten years as a stay-at-home mom.

She took on a degree in Textiles, started collecting objects to use in her work, and since then has enjoyed a highly successful career in her chosen field. Her portraits have so far appeared in 45 exhibitions in locations from London and Brussels to Hong Kong and Singapore.

The original portraits sell for between £2000 - £2600 ($3270-4250), and limited edition prints are available from £95-195 ($150-320).

'I enjoy using materials which have a history, and love art with an element of fun and the unexpected,' she writes.

No trickery: None of the plastics items are ever painted over to change their color. 'Everything is used exactly 'as found,' the artist maintains. Pictured, a representation of The Afghan Girl, a famous photo taken for National Geographic in 1985 by Steve McCurry and once hailed 'The First World's Third World Mona Lisa'

Ms Perkins sources her materials primarily from charity shops, yard sales and recycling centers, and often gets donations from friends and neighbors.

'I tend to live with a piece for a while to make sure it works,' she explains of her process, which takes an average of three weeks per portrait. 'Usually, I run out of a particular color and have to go out searching in order to finish a piece.'

Ms Perkins uses a glue gun to affix the objects initially, so that she can 'pull things off' and move them around.

'When I'm happy with the final result, I paint the whole work with a layer of diluted PVA glue,' she writes.

'I love beginning a new piece. As I find materials, I sort them into individual, color-coordinated carrier bags or boxes for each future work,' she explains.

'Starting a new work is a bit frenetic as I rush to find places for the larger, more interesting materials.

'I get so engrossed when I’m working that I completely lose track of time and cups of tea frequently go cold!'

Speaking of her Mona Lisa re-creation, she explains finding a small plastic doll that was perfect for the mouth. 'I’ve been looking for a small doll for Mona Lisa’s mouth – went to a car boot sale yesterday, and within five minutes, found exactly what I was looking for,' she wrote.

'This is a rare occurrence! Usually, I collect random items and find a use for them later.'

All that sparkles: 'I tend to live with a piece for a while to make sure it works,' Ms Perkins explains of her process, which takes an average of three weeks to complete per portrait. Pictured, Princess Diana

Time consuming: 'Usually, I run out of a particular color and have to go out searching in order to finish a piece,' she explains. Pictured, Jamaican sprinter and Olympic gold medal winner Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world

Ms Perkins limits herself to spending £20 (about $32) on each shopping trip, as she has a tendency to get 'carried away.'

'Re-interpreting work by previous artists is nothing new,' she writes. 'Centuries ago, artists learned their craft by re-working paintings by their predecessors. Picasso famously copied works by many artists.

'And Da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa has been re-worked many times by artists including Marcel Duchamp, who gave her a beard.'
