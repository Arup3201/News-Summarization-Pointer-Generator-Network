James J. Leonard Jr., her attorney, told ABC News that the drive took 90 minutes and they arrived at at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, about 2 a.m., ahead of her 3 a.m. reporting time.

The attorney said his client had been mentally preparing for her time behind bars by corresponding with recently released female prisoners who told her to be 'friendly but guarded' during her sentence.

He told NJ Advance Media: 'When we arrived at Danbury, everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and respectful.

'My family is probably one of the strongest families I know,' her daughter Gia - who's shopping around a reality show - told Access Hollywood in November.

'So we'll get through this. It's gonna be fine. And when it's over, we're gonna be better than ever.'

Teresa and Joe Giudice first came under suspicion in 2009 when the pair filed bankrupcy and then withdrew the filing just before an auction of their home's furniture was to take place.

In 2013, the couple were charged with about four dozen crimes including conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud to take $5million over a decade. The couple was also accused of lying on loan applications and on their bankruptcy papers.

Husband Joe, who is an Italian citizen, was also accused of not filing his tax returns from 2004 to 2008, when the family made $1million.

While they originally planned to plead not guilty, the married couple eventually admitted guilt on 41 fraud charges.

In addition to their individual prison sentences, the couple will also have to pay $414,000 in restitution.
