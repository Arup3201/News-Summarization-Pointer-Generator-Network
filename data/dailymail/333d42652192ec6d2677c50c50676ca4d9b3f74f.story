Ecstatic: Heather Carroll today said her sextuplets look 'wonderful' - and revealed how she had to eat 6,000 calories a day to keep them nourished

The mother of a set of sextuplets born in Alabama over Father's Day weekend today revealed how she had to consume 6,000 calories each day just to keep them nourished.

Looking ecstatic but exhausted, Heather Carroll, who is just 5'2" tall, said the tiny babies - five girls and a boy - all 'look wonderful'.

She and her husband Mitchell also revealed they have named the six alphabetically, after the letters doctors gave them when they were still in the womb: Abbie, Brooklyn, Chloe, David, Ellie and Faith.

The couple gave a press conference at Brookwood Medical Center in Birmingham today, where they were joined by gynaecologist Bill McKenzie, who proudly described the diminutive Mrs Carroll as 'country tough.'

Mrs Carroll said: 'The babies look 
great. I was expecting them to be just real weakly looking and real 
tiny. They're not. They look wonderful.'

She
gave birth to the sextuplets by planned Caesarian section on Saturday 
morning, 28 weeks and one day into her pregnancy, after a month of 
strict bed rest - including her 30th birthday.

They
arrived in the space of just three minutes, the eldest, Abbie, at 
8.05am and the youngest, Faith, at 8.08am, and weighed between 1lb 10oz 
and 2lbs 5oz.

Dr McKenzie told the Birmingham News: 'All of them were born very healthy, and that weight spread is a good sign that there was not one baby that was lagging behind, that all of them had grown and developed well. I'm extremely proud of Heather.'

The babies were welcomed into the 
world by a team of 51 medical staff, who had rehearsed the delivery six 
times before. Each baby had their own group of doctors and nurses.

Today neonatologist Vick DiCarlo said all six had been taken off their ventilators and were doing well.

His colleague, Dr McKenzie, paid tribute to Mrs Carroll, saying: 'Heather is country tough, she has a strong faith, they were very committed, despite very pessimistic odds about their success.'

The 30-year-old provoked laughter from the assembled press as she described her 6,000 calorie-a-day diet. She said: 'It was very hard. They had me keep a sheet of everything I ate, and they
would always do the calories for it.

The sextuplets were born by Caesarian section in just three minutes on Saturday.

'And all of the snacks, every day 
they would start bring me snack foods and desserts. I mean, it was very
good, but I can't imagine doing that again.'

Mrs Carroll is 115lbs, but she put on an extra 35lbs during her pregnancy, a weight she could barely carry.

The week before she gave birth, she said she could feel exactly where each of the babies were sitting: one on each hip, three lower down on her pelvis and another which moved up and down.

The Carrolls, who live in the tiny town of Plantersville in Dallas County, Alabama, already have an older son, Grant, who is 22-months-old.

The couple had struggled for years to 
have children, and Mrs Carroll had four miscarriages before being 
diagnosed with polycystic ovaries.

To have Grant, Mrs Carroll underwent 
intrauterine insemination, in which she took fertility drugs to boost 
her own egg production before her husband's sperm was injected directly 
into her uterus.

She went through the same process for her next pregnancy. It can sometimes result in twins or triplets - but rarely sextuplets.

Hello, world! Doctors gently lift up the first of the six, Abbie, who was born weighing 2lbs 5oz. All the babies are doing well and were taken off their ventilators today

In an interview shortly before the 
babies were born, she described her five-week scan to the Birmingham 
News. She said: 'I thought the nurse was going to faint. Then she said, 
"Oh, no, there's six," and started apologizing.'

Once the shock wore off, Mrs Carroll 
said she just started crying. She said: 'All I could think about was, 
"how are we going to take care of six 
babies?" because we had a hard enough time with our first.'

But her husband, a maintenance mechanic at a paper plant, said the family would manage.

Their close-knit community has already 
rallied round the couple. Friends have begun extending their log home, 
local firms have promised to supply diapers and formula milk and a car 
dealership may donate a van.

The town's church, where Mr Carroll 
helps out as youth pastor, has promised to expand its nursery, and her 
doctor's office threw her a baby shower.

A month before the babies were born, Mrs Carroll was admitted to Brockwood Medical Center for round-the-clock monitoring.

She drank a nutrient-packed milkshake
with every meal and was given extra supplements using an IV drip to 
make sure she consumed enough calories to keep the babies healthy.

For the last few days, she was experiencing regular contractions and had to take medication to stop the babies coming too soon.

Doctors said their chance of survival grew by four per cent every day they stayed in the womb, allowing their organs to develop.

Dr McKenzie said: 'It's just a very unique demand on a woman's body and she is a little 
hiccup of a girl. But she's got a very big heart.'

In the end, the babies arrived just in time for Father's Day, and Mr Carroll spent the day rushing from incubator to incubator, sporting five pink ID bands and one blue, to show he could visit the babies.

He told the Birmingham News he was 'on top of the world'. He said: 'Everything this morning was perfect.'

In a statement, Dr McKenzie said: 'Heather and Mitchell Carroll were committed to this journey, their family and community were supportive, and God was faithful.‘

I
am so proud of this mother’s toughness and appreciative for the 
excellent preparation and care she received at Brookwood Medical 
Center.’

Mrs
Carroll is the second woman in the U.S. to give birth to sextuplets 
this month. Two weeks ago Stacey Carey, from Abington, Pennsylvania, also had six babies.
