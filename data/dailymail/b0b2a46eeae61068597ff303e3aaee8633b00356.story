A female suicide bomber killed 16 people and injured dozens more at the main entrance of a railway station in Russia yesterday.

It was the second deadly attack in the space of three days in  Volgograd and raises fears of  a terror campaign before and during the Winter Olympics which the country is due to host in 39 days.

The bomber - named as 26-year-old Oksana Aslanova - detonated her explosives in front of a metal detector as passengers made their way to and from trains.

Casualty: A man lies outside the station as emergency services attend the incident

Wounded: A man, who has sustained injuries to his head, arrives at hospital following the blast

TV footage showed a massive orange 
fireball filling the hall and corridors of the imposing Stalinist 
building, with smoke and dust billowing out through shattered windows.

Witness
 Alexander Koblyakov said: ‘People were lying on the ground, screaming 
and asking for help. I helped carry out a police officer whose head and 
face were covered in blood. He couldn’t speak.’

Vladimir
 Markin, a spokesman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said:  ‘A 
suicide bomber who was approaching a metal detector saw a law 
enforcement official and, after growing nervous, set off an explosive 
device.’

A policeman who ‘spotted the suspicious woman’ was last night hailed as a hero for saving ‘hundreds of lives’.

According to reports the officer, Dmitry Makovkin, 29, rushed towards her seconds before the blast and was killed.

This man, whose hands and face have been bandaged after the blast, was also wounded in the explosion

Deadly: The attack had heightened concerns in Russia over the security of the upcoming Sochi winter Olympics

More than 40 people were reported as injured and the death toll could rise, according to Russian officials.

The
 attacker was named as Aslanova, who had twice 
married separatist Muslim gang leaders from the troubled Caucasus 
region, sources said.

She
 had been on Russia’s wanted list for 18 months before the attack which 
used 16lb of TNT, the deadliest in Russia for three years.

The bomb was the equivalent to at least 10kg of TNT, said to Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin, and was stuffed with metal shrapnel.

President Vladimir Putin has reportedly instructed special flights to be laid on to airlift the injured to Moscow clinics if necessary. 

Metal detectors have been mandatory in railway stations and airports throughout Russia since a suicide bomber killed 37 people at Domodedovo airport in 2011.

No one has yet taken responsibility for the attack that took place this morning at a city centre train station 

Last month a female suicide bomber killed six people on a bus that was travelling in the same city

Emergency services responded to treat victims at the scene of the attack which has raised terrorism concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics

Footage from a CCTV camera facing the
 station showed the moment the bomb went off, with a bright orange flash
 emerging from inside the station followed by billowing smoke. 

'Someone
 tried to get inside the train station but was not allowed in,' an 
unidentified law enforcement official told Vysota 102, a local news 
agency. 'After that an explosion went off.'

Among the dead was a police officer checking people entering the train station and a child, The Moscow Times reports.

Local media reports claim taxi drivers queuing for customers outside the station were the first respondents to the emergency.

Volgograd
 mayor, Irina Guseva said the drivers were able to save lives by taking 
injured victims to hospital before ambulances arrived at the scene.

The
 attack comes months after Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov called for 
new attacks against civilian targets in Russia, including the 2014 Games 
which will take place in Sochi.

In October, a female suicide bomber 
blew herself up on a  bus in the city where today's attack took place, 
killing six people and injuring about 30.

Officials
 said at the time the attacker came from the province of Dagestan, the 
center of an Islamist insurgency that has spread across the region after
 two separatist wars in Chechnya.

On Friday a car rigged with explosives blew up on a street in Pyatigorsk in the North Caucasus Mountains.
