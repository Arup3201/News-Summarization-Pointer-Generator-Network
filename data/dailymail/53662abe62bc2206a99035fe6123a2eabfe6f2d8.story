Labour is considering plans to raise National Insurance contributions to fund a massive spending increase in the NHS, it has been claimed.

The Shadow Cabinet is looking at  adding 1 per cent to National  Insurance bills for both employees and employers which would be ring-fenced for health spending.

The rise would replicate Gordon Brown’s 1 per cent rise, which was  successfully introduced in the 2002 Budget to boost investment in the NHS.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will consider the implications of the National Insurance tax hike

Labour will hope that a 2015 manifesto commitment to fund a bigger health budget will go down well with voters and create a dividing line with the Tories.

But it is likely to be unpopular with business leaders, who are expected to warn that any National Insurance rise could cost tens of thousands of jobs.

It is also probable that the Conservatives would accuse Labour of planning a ‘tax bombshell’ that will add to families’ bills at the same time as the party campaigns about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’.

Labour is understood to be on the lookout for radical, eye-catching policies – such as increased NHS spending – as it prepares for next year’s election. A ring-fenced rise in National Insurance contributions is thought to be one of the favoured options to pay for the increase.

The NI rate varies depending on income and work status, but it is 12 per cent for employees on most of their earnings.

A recent poll of marginal seats found that despite the party’s close association with the NHS, only 29 per cent of people agreed that Labour was the ‘most trusted’ party to run the Health Service.

Labour MP Frank Field has drawn up proposals for the NI plan, and has  presented his ideas to Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls,  health spokesman Andy Burnham and the chairman of Labour’s policy review, Jon Cruddas.

Mr Field believes that voters would accept a tax increase if it was spent exclusively on health. He said: ‘Labour desperately needs big ideas to capture the imagination, and this should be one.’

Researchers have warned that there is a looming annual £30billion black hole in NHS spending, with costs reaching more than £130billion a year by 2020.

A Labour spokesman last night denied there were set plans for an increase in NI contributions, saying: ‘It is complete nonsense ... there are no plans of this sort.’

Before the 2001 election, Gordon Brown successfully argued for a 1 per cent increase in NI contributions to fund investment in the NHS.

However, when he announced plans for another 1 per cent rise, which was not  to exclusively fund the NHS, in the lead-up to the 2010 general election, it was widely criticised.

The CBI said higher taxes on employers would cause firms to be more cautious about recruitment, while an Oxford Economics study predicted that it would lead to 91,000 fewer jobs.
