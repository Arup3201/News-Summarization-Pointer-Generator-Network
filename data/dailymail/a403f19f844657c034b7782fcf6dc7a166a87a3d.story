The Liberal Democrats are to unveil a rival Budget tomorrow in an unprecedented statement to Parliament which will signal the end of the Coalition.

Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will hold up a yellow budget box - mimicking the red leather case used by the Chancellor - before setting out what his party's tax and spending priorities after the election.

He will promise to make tax dodging as unacceptable as drink-driving, increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500 and targeting the wealthy instead of cutting spending.

It is understood the unique statement from the Despatch Box had to be agreed with Commons Speaker John Bercow, and is likely to infuriate Labour for using government time to make a highly political speech.

Nick Clegg has described the Budget as the 'last act of significant decision-making by this coalition Government'. 

Chancellor George Osborne is using his Budget statement today to set out the official coalition government position for the last time before the election.

But he has made clear that in a Conservative government he would eradicate the deficit through spending cuts alone, without tax rises. 

This would include £12billion of cuts from the welfare budget, including a ban on under-25s claiming housing benefit, restricting child benefit to three children and cutting the amount families can claim in handouts from £26,000 to £23,000.

But all the changes to benefits have been blocked by the Lib Dems, and are instead expected to be included in the Tory election manifesto when it is unveiled next month.

On Saturday Mr Alexander unveiled his bizarre yellow leather briefcase which he held aloft in an echo of the Chancellor on the steps of Number 11. 

It was later auctioned off to a Lib Dem activist for £1,500. It is expected to make another appearance tomorrow, before Mr Alexander gives his statement to the Commons.

Mr Alexander will rule out any extra increases to VAT, income tax or national insurance, but demand tax rises on the wealthy. 

He will use official Treasury figures to back up his call for the deficit to be eradicated through 70 per cent spending cuts and 30 per cent tax rises.

A senior Lib Dem source said: We are going to set out what our spending plans will be for the next Parliament.

'There are big chunks that the Chancellor will say today which will be very much what the Tories' plans will be.'

In a speech at the Lib Dem conference, Mr Alexander set out some of the measures which would be in a Lib Dem budget. 

He promised a crackdown on tax dodgers, saying it should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving.

In the wake of the HSBC scandal he said: 'As recent weeks have shown yet again, nothing upsets law-abiding taxpayers more than people who think they can evade paying the tax they owe.

'Paying the tax you owe isn't an optional extra - it's a legal requirement. Quite rightly, benefit fiddling is a crime and a social taboo. For too long, tax evasion has been seen by the rich and privileged more like a sport than the crime it is.

'So in our future vision, there'll be even more measures to crack down hard on the tax dodgers.'

He continued: 'I want to see those who aid, abet, facilitate or encourage tax evasion hit as hard with criminal and financial penalties as the tax evaders themselves. That will be in our manifesto too.'

Mr Alexander joined Mr Osborne and other Tory Treasury ministers outside Number 11 this morning

A Lib Dem budget would include the party's flagship policy of raising the income tax personal allowance to £12,500 and would involve 'balancing the books fairly, not on the backs of the working people on low pay'.

He accused the Tories of wanting to 'cut for cut's sake even after the books are balanced'.

'A Conservative Party with no heart, but two minds. One to stay in Europe, the other to leave,' he said.

'A Conservative Party that wants to balance the books solely on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society.

'The prospect of a Britain under a majority Conservative government is grim indeed. And haven't we all groaned when they use their soulless mantra - long-term economic plan. The truth is their long-term economic plan means long-term economic pain for millions of families.'
