The family of a nine-year-old girl who accidentally killed a shooting range instructor with an Uzi have spoken of the devastation at the tragedy.

The girl's parents, named in a police report as Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan, released a statement saying that they prayed that instructor Charles Vacca would survive after the incident at the Last Stop range in White Hills last Monday.

The statement came as officers investigating the death released police reports, which say that immediately after the shooting, the girl said she felt that the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder.

Her family members were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured by the gun's recoil and didn't immediately realize that Mr Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues ran over to him, the reports state.

New Jersey-based lawyer Kevin Walsh released a statement saying that the girl's family 'prayed day and night that (Mr Vacca) would survive his injury, and they continue to pray for his family during this terribly difficult time.'

However, neither the reports nor the statement by Mr Walsh explains why the parents let the girl take the Uzi.

The family had taken a shuttle from Las Vegas to the range around 60 miles away during their vacation to the city.

After arriving, the girl, her parents, sister and brother took a monster truck ride before heading to the shooting range.

The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Mr Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot the gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, according to the reports.

He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Mr Vacca with a shot to the head, the reports state.

The girl then dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl then ran towards her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder.

Another instructor rushed over to help to Mr Vacca and the other children were then taken away from the range. The reports describe the family as shaken by the accident.

Recordings of 911 calls show that people at the shooting range desperately tried to keep unconscious Mr Vacca alive as they urged emergency dispatchers to send a medical helicopter.

The call handler can be heard urging the caller to apply pressure to Mr Vacca's wound.

He was then flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later.

Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case but Arizona's workplace safety agency is investigating the death.

County prosecutors say the instructor was probably the most criminally negligent person involved in the accident for having allowed the child to hold the gun without enough training.

They also added that the parents and child weren't criminally culpable.

In the video, released by investigators, Mr Vacca can be heared saying 'All right, go ahead and give me one shot.'

He then cheers when she fires one round at the target and then says, 'All right, full auto.'

However, the footage, which does not show Mr Vacca being shot, ends with series of shots being heard.

Mr Vacca's ex-wife and children have said they harbour no ill feelings toward the girl and her family and instead say they feel sorry for the child and want to comfort her.

Meanwhile, Sam Scarmardo, the range's operator, has said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules.

He also said he never had a safety problem before at the range and his policy of allowing children eight and older to fire guns under adult supervision and an instructor's watchful eye is standard industry practice, though he noted his policies are under review.
