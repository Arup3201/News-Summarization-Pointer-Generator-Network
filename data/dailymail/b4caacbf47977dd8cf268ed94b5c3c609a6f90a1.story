A spearfisherman has been bitten by a shark at a popular holiday destination on the New South Wales south coast.

Sam Smith, 17, was fishing off Mollymook Beach with his friend Luke Sisinni when he was attacked by the 1.5 metre long shark after he 'went down to film it', according to the Milton Ulladulla Times.

Paramedics rushed to the scene just before midday, as hundreds of children competing in the 2015 Stramit NSW Country Surf Life Saving Championships looked on.

Mr Smith was fishing when he saw the shark and tried to go down to film it, according to his friend Luke Sisinni.

'He said it spun around and started coming for him, so he stabbed it with his spear to try and scare it off, but it just went ballistic and bit him,' Mr Sisinni said.

'[Sam] came up screaming saying "I got bitten by a shark"'. 

Two ambulances arrived at the beach and the boy was treated with lacerations to his left hand, including multiple lacerations to his fingers.

The boy was taken to Milton Ulladulla hospital where he is in a stable condition, and later flown to Sydney for specialist treatment.
