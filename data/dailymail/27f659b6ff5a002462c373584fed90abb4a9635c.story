The striker will be assessed ahead of Tottenham's trip to the King Power Stadium but has not started for the Foxes since their Capital One Cup defeat to Shrewsbury in August.

Matt Upson is expected to make his return from a foot injury in the new year while Kasper Schmeichel remains out with a broken metatarsal he suffered in training.

Provisional squad: Hamer, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Hammond, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell.

Tottenham

Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is hopeful Ryan Mason will be fit for the Boxing Day clash.

The 23-year-old midfielder has established himself in Pochettino's side in recent weeks but was forced off during Saturday's 2-1 win over Burnley with a twisted ankle.

But Pochettino revealed the issue is not as bad as first feared and is now in contention for the game at the King Power Stadium, as is striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who has not featured since early November.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Dier, Rose, Davies, Fazio, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Mason, Capoue, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Kane, Adebayor.
