It's believed that Wright purchased the Bradman Court property for $1.4 million in May 2010 when his world tour career had just started.

Wright told Gold Coast Bulletin that he owned the property for five years and said he loved the 'great waves' and 'friendly welcoming people' in the area.

'I’ve owned it going on five years now and my two favourite things were to wake up in the master bedroom and look straight out at the waves and the second was to walk out the gate and down to the beach for a surf,' he said.

'Having the beach so close was a dream for me.'

The champion surfer, who is ranked number 12 on the ASP World Championship Tour, is currently competing overseas at the Reef Hawaiian Pro tournament.
