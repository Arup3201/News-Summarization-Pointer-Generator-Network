Europe has an estimated 421 million fewer birds today than it did 30 years ago as modern farming methods and urbanisation have caused their habitats to vanish, according to a new study.

Most of the birds lost, around 90 per cent, have been the most common and widespread species, including sparrows, skylarks, grey partridges and starlings.

Scientists believe the population crash can be linked to modern farming methods and deteriorating and fragmenting habitats.

'It is very worrying that the most common species of bird are declining rapidly because it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most,' said Dr Richard Inger, one of the researchers from the University of Exeter.

'It is becoming increasingly clear that interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well-being, and significant loss of common birds could be quite detrimental to human society.'

However, the study found that not all common birds are declining and populations of great tits, blue tits, robins and blackbirds, are all going up.

Risk: Around 90 per cent of the birds lost have been common species, such as starlings which were seen creating shape-shifting cloud formations above the rooftops of Longtown, Cumbria, earlier this week

Rare species such as marsh harriers, ravens, buzzards, storks and stone curlews had also shown increases in recent years, which researchers said was probably due to conservation efforts.

The research, co-led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), is published in the journal Ecology Letters.

'The rarer birds in this study, whose populations are increasing, have benefited from protection across Europe,' said Dr Richard Gregory, from the RSPB's Centre for Conservation Science.

'For example, white storks and marsh harriers receive among the highest level of protection in the EU - this is why their numbers have increased. 

'The conservation and legal protection of all birds and their habitats in tandem are essential to reverse declines.

'This is a warning from birds throughout Europe. It is clear that the way we are managing the environment is unsustainable for many of our most familiar species.'

Worry: Dr Richard Inger said it is worrying that the most common species of bird, such as starlings, are declining rapidly because 'it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most'

Dr Inger said that 'interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well-being', so losing vast numbers of common birds could be 'detrimental to human society'

The scientists analysed data on 144 species of European birds collected from numerous surveys in 25 different countries.

Much of the information was provided by thousands of volunteer fieldworkers who identified and counted birds in the areas where they lived.

The researchers concluded that more conservation should be directed at wider-scale environmental improvement, such as urban green space projects and effective environmental schemes aimed at farmland.
