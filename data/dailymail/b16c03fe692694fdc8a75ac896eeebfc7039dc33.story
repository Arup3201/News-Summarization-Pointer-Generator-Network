Google yesterday announced record British earnings of £3.6billion last year, an increase of £600million on 2012.

But the online search giant has yet to disclose how much corporation tax it will pay.

It will come under enormous pressure over the figure following fierce criticism over its tax affairs. For 2012, the US multinational paid just £11.6million of tax on an income of £3billion.

Fresh storm: Google announced $3.4bn profit for the last quarter of 2013, but its expected tax bill is just £11.2m

It was accused of leaving hard-pressed families and businesses to fund public services such as hospitals and schools.

Experts
 say Google’s corporation tax bill for 2013 is likely to be much lower 
than it should be because the group runs its British operations out of 
Ireland.

Pretty profits: Google CEO Larry Page called the results 'another great quarter of momentum'

‘On the basis of 
Google’s global performance and the share of its profits in the UK we 
would expect it to pay more than £200million a year in the UK,’ said tax
 accountant Richard Murphy, who helped expose coffee chain Starbucks for
 avoiding tax.

‘What we
 know is that for the last year it reported, Google declared it paid 
just £11million. So the question is on the table – where are the missing
 millions?’

Margaret Hodge, 
chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee urged the Government 
to take action. ‘This again shows the scandal where profits are made 
from economic activity and yet Google refuses to pay its fair share of 
tax,’ she said.

Jonathan 
Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Ordinary 
taxpayers are angry when big international companies take advantage of 
the loopholes in our increasingly complicated tax system.

‘But
 the fact is, it is the politicians themselves who are responsible for 
this by creating a tax code which is hugely complicated and open to 
being exploited.

‘The only solution to this is to create a simpler, fairer and more competitive tax system.’

Investment: Google Glass is one of the products that the company is pouring its profits into

Google
 employs almost 2,000 people in the UK, the majority of whom negotiate 
advertising sales deals. But it books the transactions in Ireland, 
allowing it to minimise the tax it pays here.

A
 company spokesman said yesterday: ‘Like most multinationals we pay the 
bulk of our £1.2billion corporate tax bill where our business 
originated, in our case the US. That’s a rate of more than 19 per cent, 
roughly what a UK-based company would pay.

‘We’re
 also a significant contributor to the UK economy, having created over 
2,000 jobs. In 2013 alone we invested more than £300million in property,
 and tax related to our UK operations totalled more than £150million.’
