A koala which was hit by a car and scurried up a tree before falling from it unconscious, has been saved by a firefighter who performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on it.

The koala, dubbed Sean, was caught in a blanket by quick-thinking firefighters who were placed underneath the tree in the event it fell.

Rescue teams from Langwarrin, in Melbourne's outer southeast, and another from Wildlife Victoria rescued the animal on Thursday night after members of the public first spotted it stuck up a tree.

They called in the rescuers who said the koala had been hit by a car before climbing up the tree.

A team from the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) arrived in a truck with an extended ladder capable of reaching the animal, but before they got to him he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

The firefighters managed to catch him in an outstretched blanket before giving Sean mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, oxygen and chest compressions by wildlife officers.

Langwarrin CFA Captain Sean Curtin told Fairfax Media's 3AW it was initially thought the koala was dead in the tree.

'We believe it died in the tree, just when we were trying to rescue it.'

'Then it fell out of the tree and the members caught it in a blanket,' Mr Curtin told Fairfax Media.

'Wildlife Victoria performed mouth-to-mouth and compressions and gave it some oxygen therapy as well.'

Mr Curtin told 9NEWS that the CFA had a strong connection with koalas ever since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires which destroyed the animal's Victorian habitats.

'To be able to put it back in the community and have a fantastic result like that from a koala is absolutely brilliant,' Mr Curtin said.

Kylie Juraschek, also of the CFA, said the crew were relieved that the animal was recovering after the ordeal and said the team had put a lot of work into his rescue.

'It is very rewarding because unfortunately we get called out to a lot of sad situations,' she said.

'It was just a very, very good feeling and pleasing to see.'

The animal is receiving treatment for its injuries at a Victorian animal hospital. 

'It's doing OK but it needs to assessed by a vet today. It doesn't have any visible injuries and seems to be in good shape,' a Wildlife Victoria spokeswoman said.

The incident comes following the release of a koala back in to the wild after it clung for his life to the grille of a car for nearly 90kms.

Nicknamed Blinky Grille, the koala arrived at the Australia Zoo Wildlife hospital four weeks ago after colliding with a car on the Bruce Highway, north of Brisbane.

The animal was found at a service station near Gympie and taken into care before being released last week.
