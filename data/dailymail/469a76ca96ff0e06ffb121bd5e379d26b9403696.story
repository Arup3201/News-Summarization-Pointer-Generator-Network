High-end: Sainsbury's will start stocking £130 bottles of Krug

Forget house prices or the  number of prestigious 4x4s parked in the drive – there’s a new way to tell whether or not you live in an affluent neighbourhood.

Supermarket giant Sainsbury’s has chosen just 53 branches out of more than 1,000 nationwide to become part of its new breed of  Champagne Stores.

Catering to the wealthy customers who frequent them, these stores will be the only ones in the Sainsbury’s empire that will stock the more upmarket brands of bubbly, including £130 bottles of Krug and a range of Bollinger ‘Cru’ vintages.

The supermarket is planning a two-tier system for spirits too, where only certain stores will supply £70 bottles of 17-year-old malts or a £120 Glenmorangie.

A spokeswoman said: ‘Within our Champagne Stores we have significantly extended our champagne offering to include ultra premium brands such  as Krug, Dom Perignon and Bollinger Grand Année, as well as a greater choice of products available in magnum.

‘The response from our customers to this news has been very positive, and it suggests that while some customers have traded down to more affordable but less prestigious options, such as prosecco, there is real potential to open up the top-end of the market to customers willing to experiment.’

And so to the big question: which areas does Sainsbury’s consider posh enough to have one of its  Champagne Stores? 

At the moment, there is a clear North-South divide – the vast majority of the revamped shops are in London and the Home Counties.

Two tier: Some Sainsbury's stores will be considerably more upmarket than others in their drinks selection, depending on the area

Well-catered: Winchester in Hampshire made the cut as a town that would buy champagne

There are none in Wales or Yorkshire, and Scotland merits only one inclusion – Garthdee, a suburb of oil-rich Aberdeen.

Prime Minister David Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson and other members of the well-heeled Chipping Norton Set can breathe a sigh of relief – the Sainsbury’s store in Banbury, Oxfordshire, will be stocking up with Bollinger.

And should Tony Blair find time to return to his old constituency of Sedgefield, County Durham, he might dip into the millions of pounds he has made since leaving office to treat his wife Cherie to a bottle of Krug.

Nearby Darlington is also on the list, perhaps surprisingly as the North East town is more associated with brown ale and the industrial birthplace of railways than popping champagne corks.

Other locations include some of the more scenic towns of Britain, such as Chester, and Penrith in the Lake District.

King’s Lynn in Norfolk also makes the grade, which will be of comfort to cultured local resident Stephen Fry should he want a more expensive brand of bubbly to impress his dinner party guests.
