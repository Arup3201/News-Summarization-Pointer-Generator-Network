Two Georgia brothers reported missing earlier this week have been found safe and well in Texas while their father has been arrested on abduction charges.

Police have been searching for Daniel Cleary, 46, and his two sons Ben, 9, and Henry, 7, after he failed to return the two boys to their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday.

On Friday police released surveillance photos which showed the three in a Walmart store in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

An amber alert was issued for the boys after their mother Theresa Nash reported them missing.

She said she was particularly concerned as 
Daniel Cleary had purchased a firearm about a month ago, was under 
stress and drinking.

Cleary, of Roswell, was taken into custody today.

'We have recovered the kids,' McGee said. 'They were with him and they were OK.'

Austin police said a citizen had recognized the boys from the alert and 
notified police at 5:11 p.m. CDT that they were at a hotel.

Ms Nash, spoke to the boys by phone and was on the way to get them, police said.

Hunt: CCTV images were captured last Sunday and Monday while Cleary and the two boys, seen wearing blue vests, were on a planned trip to the Tennessee Aquarium

On Thursday, Roswell police issued the
 nationwide Amber Alert, known in Georgia as Levi’s Call, after 
discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating 
with the boys' mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the 
whereabouts of their children.

'He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM.
 'He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably 
realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.'

The CCTV images released Friday 
afternoon showed Mr Cleary with his children shopping at the 
Chattanooga Walmart, captured on December 23 and 24.

Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it.

Ms Nash last heard from her 
ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys
 would be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive. 

Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock handgun

Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off.

With mounting concern, Theresa Nash 
drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only
 to discover that the house had been cleared out of TVs and other 
electronics.

Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot. 

Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him.

The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father.

‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’

According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November.

The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.
