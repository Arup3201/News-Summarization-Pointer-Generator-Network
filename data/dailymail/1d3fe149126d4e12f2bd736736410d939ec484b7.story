An Egyptian Christian has been sentenced to six years in prison after he was convicted of blasphemy and contempt of religion.

Kerolos Ghattas was arrested earlier this month for posting images which were deemed insulting to Islam on to his Facebook page.

A court in Luxor, in southern Egypt, has now convicted the 30-year-old.

Ghattas' arrest sparked fears of sectarian conflict in his village, where unidentified assailants have hurled molotov cocktails at shops owned by Christians.

Local authorities beefed up security in the village on Tuesday.

The verdict can be appealed. Egypt has witnessed a rise in the number of cases of Coptic Christians — estimated as 10 per cent of the population — over the past three years.

On Monday, another Christian journalist — a convert — was sentenced to six years in prison over his coverage of recent sectarian strife.

Egypt's Christians have complained of discrimination by the nation's Muslim majority.

They have heavily invested in the anti-Islamist movement in the hope of gaining equal rights with their Muslim compatriots, and have overwhelmingly backed President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the former army chief who overthrew the Islamist president last July.
