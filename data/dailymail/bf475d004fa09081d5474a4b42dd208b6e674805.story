A teenage boy has been rushed to hospital after being run over by a van while sunbaking near a beach.

18-year-old Miles Davies from Armidale was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in inner-city Sydney after being hit by the vehicle on a patch of grass near Coogee Beach, in the city's south-east. 

A NSW Ambulance spokesperson said they received a call at 11.45am after reports a blue van had hit Mr Davies about 20 metres off Arden Street right outside the popular Chish N Fips seafood restaurant in Coogee.

18-year-old Miles Davies from Armidale was taken to St Vincent's Hospital in inner-city Sydney after being hit by the vehicle on a patch of grass near Coogee Beach, in the city's south-east.

Mr Davies suffered head and abdominal injuries but the hospital told Daily Mail Australia he is in a stable condition.

Mr Davies was enjoying a day off from work when he was hit by the van.

He had recently moved from Armidale to Sydney to work in a Balmain restaurant. 

The van driver, who can be seen in the picture below, dressed in a yellow high visibility jacket and blue work trousers, was carrying out some plumbing work in the area and accidentally dragged the 18-year-old across the grass.

Mr Davies became disorientated when he realised that his head was stuck underneath the van.

Speaking to 9News from his hospital bed, the youth was shook up after the traumatic accident. 

'My head hit the underpart of the car and it kind of ripped it a little and then dragged me along for a few metres,' he said. 

'All of a sudden you realise you have a car on top of you and I had blood down my face I was just kind of thinking what’s happening here?'.
