The killer of a Sydney woman who bludgeoned her to death with a rock, crushing her face and then dumping her body on a bush track has been jailed, more than 20 years after her 'barbaric' rape and murder.

Steve Isac Matthews, 43, was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and three months behind bars on Thursday in the NSW Supreme Court for the murder of Pia Navida, AAP reports.

Ms Navida was aÂ  37-year-old Filipino woman who had come to Australia in the early 1980s as a bride. She got involved in drugs, fell into a nomadic lifestyle and began working as a prostitute near Sydney's Central Railway Station.

In January 1992, she disappeared. Bushwalkers found her underwear and clothing scattered at Bundeena, in the Royal National Park on the south coast of NSW on February 1, and her body was uncovered soon afterwards.

Face crushed: After coming to Australia from the Philippines as a young bridge, Pia Navida fell into drugs and prostitution and in January 1992 the 37-year-old was taken to the Royal National Park south of Sydney where she was raped by Steve Matthews, 20, then bludgeoned with a large rock which crushed in her face

Terrible find: Bushwalkers hiking at Bundeena in bushland on the NSW south coast on February 1, 1992 found these clothes belonging to murder victim Pia Navida scattered on a bush track. The dead woman's body was found soon aftewards

Police determined she had been raped and then bludgeoned to death with a large rock, completely crushing her face, her body then dragged a small distance and dumped.

The case went unsolved until 2011 when advances in DNA technology allowed police to match semen found on and inside Ms Navida's body to Steve Isaac Matthews and another man, Rodney James Paterson.

The men were charged, but Paterson maintained his innocence. Justice Geoffrey Bellew acquitted him in March after upholding Paterson's application that the evidence was incapable of convincing a jury of his guilt.

Body found: a track through the bushland at Bundeena in the Royal National Park south of Sydney, where Filipina woman Pia Navida's body was found 22 years ago and for whose murder a man, Steve Matthews, has finally been sent to prison for a minimum of 16 years and three months

Justice Bellew told the court on Thursday Matthews had taken a girlfriend for picnics to Bundeena, where Ms Navida was found, when he dated her in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Matthews had told her he had killed a person in a bush area and demonstrated to her what he had done. He would have been 21 at the time.The court heard Matthews was himself a victim of a major assault in 2005, which had left him with a serious brain injury and little memory of his earlier life.Justice Bellew said that while Matthews had recently shown remorse, saying he was 'sickened and disgusted' by his actions, his criminal history did not allow for leniency in his sentence.

Justice Geoffrey Bellew said Matthews's maximum sentence of 21 years and six months was appropriate given the "barbaric" and "horrendous" nature of his crime.Matthews will be eligible for parole in November 2027.
