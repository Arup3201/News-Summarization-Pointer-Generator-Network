A New Jersey accountant allegedly conned the state out of $700,000 which he then spent on expensive jewlery and fleet of luxury cars.

Todd Halpern, 48, from Livingston, was charged with 14 other people after an investigation named ‘Operation April Fools’ uncovered his scheme.

Halpern spent his money on season tickets to the New York Giants, expensive jewelry, a Cadillac Escalade, Lexus GX-470 and a 1957 Chevy Bel Air.

He has been charged with money laundering (1st degree), conspiracy (2nd degree) and identity theft (2nd degree).

Halpern and the group allegedly filed false 36 unemployment claims between October 2008 and May 2012, and false records to back them up. They were worth $694,606.

The records showed work at nine businesses, and payments into the unemployment fund, with eight of those businesses saying they were unaware of the activity.

Todd Halpern's father and mother-in-law Jack and Miriam Chesner have also been charged for fraud

A total of 17 fraudulent claims were 
allegedly filed in the names of the 15 defendants, although none were 
filed in Halpern’s name.

The other claims were done using stolen identities and social security numbers, some of which were clients of Halpern.

Defendants
include Todd Halpern’s father, George J. Halpern, 74, who is also an 
accountant, and Todd Halpern’s father and mother-in-law, Jack and Miriam
Chesner.

Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman.
Said: ‘To satisfy his greed, Todd Halpern allegedly stole the 
identities of his clients and fraudulently collected hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in unemployment benefits.

'The alleged thefts committed by this
con artist and his co-defendants constitute an affront to honest, 
hardworking New Jersey residents, who pay into the unemployment 
insurance fund with their employers and who count on benefits being 
available as a safety net if they lose their jobs.’

Halpern pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax and wire fraud on June 5th.

Halpern was arrested during ‘Operation 
April Fools,’ a joint investigation by the New Jersey Division of 
Criminal Justice and the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce 
Development.

Since March 2011, more than $253million of fraud has been stopped in the state.

Commissioner Harold J. Wirths of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development said: ‘If not for the many new anti-fraud measures put into the place during this administration, we would not be catching these types of schemes.

‘We have been recognized twice by the U.S. Department of Labor for leading the nation in combating fraud. We will continue to find new tools and utilize every measure possible to protect public funds.

Director Elie Honig of the Division 
of Criminal Justice  said: ‘This indictment serves notice that we have 
both the will and the technology to detect those who attempt to steal 
unemployment benefits, and when we do, we will prosecute them to the 
full extent of the law.

‘We will continue to partner with the Department of Labor to bring these cases and safeguard the unemployment insurance fund.’

The indictment was handed up to Superior Court Judge Pedro J. Jimenez Jr. who assigned the case to Mercer County.
