John Terry is ready to accept a one-year contract at Chelsea if it means prolonging his playing career at Stamford Bridge.

The club captain, showing some of the best form of his career, comes to the end of his current five-year, £150,000-a-week deal in June.

Terry, 33, had wanted a two-year deal, but was told Chelsea policy for players over the age of 30 is to offer only 12 months. He has accepted this and is hoping to start his 17th season as a professional with Chelsea in August.

The centre back, the last Chelsea player to establish himself in the first team having come through the academy, is already in line to be the club’s player of the year. It is even possible Terry will be PFA player of the year. Voting for the award takes place next month.

He was outstanding in the 1-0 victory at Manchester City on Monday and has played every minute of all 24 Barclays Premier League fixtures under Jose Mourinho. The manager has assured Terry his contract will be taken care of by the summer, but the defender wants the situation resolved before then.

Terry’s appetite to continue at Chelsea can only have been strengthened by the victory at the Etihad, which highlighted Mourinho’s tactical genius and unmatched attention to detail.

For two days solid, he walked and talked his team through his plans for City. These are the games Mourinho craves, the special occasions with a cup-tie feel.

Chelsea’s players, along with those he left behind at Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, will tell you that he is at his best in these moments. Even when Mourinho took his squad into the media auditorium to run them through some video grabs, the bit every player hates, they listened intently.

They wanted to nick a result at City, just as they had when they beat Manuel Pellegrini’s team 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Instead it was a performance of shock and awe, laced with enormous belief. The 1-0 scoreline did not do it justice.

Much of Mourinho’s work is bluff but no-one can dispute his success. Can you imagine David Moyes pulling a stunt such as passing on the pre-match team talk to a masseur? Of course not. But that is what Mourinho did, handing over responsibilities to Billy McCulloch in the minutes before kick-off.

Nothing would give the Chelsea manager greater pleasure than to win a third league title at Stamford Bridge but victory against a City team scoring goals for fun - and with 11 straight wins at home - probably just makes it into his top 10 all-time results.

Mourinho’s capacity to shock, as he did with Porto when Costinha’s added-time goal knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2004, is one of his strengths.

A few months later Mourinho engineered the destruction of Monaco in the final when Porto ran out 3-0 winners in Gelsenkirchen.

As Mourinho closed in on his second European Cup in 2010, Dutch ace Wesley Sneijder gave the performance of his career to help Inter win 1-0 on the manager’s return to Stamford Bridge.

Then, in the final at the Bernabeu, Louis van Gaal was lured into Mourinho’s trap by focusing Bayern Munich’s energies on nullifying Samuel Eto’o. The striker agreed to sacrifice himself and his forward partner Diego Milito scored twice to win Inter the trophy.

Mourinho trusts his methods and repeats training-ground drills until players match his demands. Those exercises were not a lot of fun for Chelsea this week, but the manager knew they were necessary before facing a team with a goalscoring record at home that now reads: 4, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4… and 0.

‘We prepared very well,’ said Nemanja Matic, who got to grips with the drifting runs of David Silva in the first half.

‘The coach showed us some videos of City and of course they showed their quality but also their mistakes. The preparation was very good and of big quality.’

On Saturday, more than 48 hours before kick-off, Mourinho’s players couldn’t work out his team or the system he was likely to employ.

Willian, though, looked certain to be 
out, with Ramires taking his place on the right. Either Mourinho changed
 his mind or he only made a decision when he called his team together at
 their Manchester hotel at noon on Monday.

‘We have more confidence now because it is not easy to play Manchester City,’ added Matic. ‘We can prepare for any team.’

With Mourinho in charge, Chelsea have the measure of most of them.
