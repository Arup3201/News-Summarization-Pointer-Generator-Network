The BBC tries to write off women over 50 as ‘barking’ and employees are afraid to speak out because of a culture of bullying, a former journalist has claimed.

Lifting the lid on the culture of sexist ageism at the Corporation, Olenka Frenkiel told peers she feared her bosses would ‘try to paint me mad’ when she challenged the redundancy notice she was served with after entering her mid-50s.

The damning comments are made in evidence to a House of Lords inquiry into the representation of women in the broadcast media. The inquiry report, due to be published tomorrow, is expected to say the BBC should do more to ensure older women appear on TV.

Critics say it is wrong that elderly male presenters such as David Dimbleby, aged 76, are given prestigious roles such as fronting the BBC’s election coverage, while women over 50 are rarely seen on its shows.

The issue of ageism at the BBC first came to prominence four years ago when former Countryfile host Miriam O’Reilly won a discrimination case against the broadcaster.

And in written evidence to the inquiry, published on the committee’s website, Miss Frenkiel said she was forced out of the BBC for being too old, despite her award-winning track record over 30 years there.

She refused to sign a gagging clause after she was told in 2011 she was facing compulsory redundancy. ‘I feared the BBC would try to destroy my character as I had seen them do to others,’ she said. ‘Older women are routinely diminished with single words; “barking” or “impossible”.’

Employees are ‘frightened to speak’, she said, because of ‘covert methods the BBC uses against its own staff’. Miss Frenkiel said a Radio 4 programme on the issue of women at the Corporation was ‘editorially corrupt’, as it gave space to comedian Rowan Atkinson to attack the tribunal’s judgment against the BBC even though Miss O’Reilly was not on the programme.

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘As we explained to the House of Lords committee last year, nearly half of the BBC’s news and current affairs workforce is female with 37.3 per cent in leadership positions in network news and 35.1 per cent in global news and we have a large number of on-air and management positions filled by women in news.

‘We’re addressing the imbalance on-air and off-air.’
