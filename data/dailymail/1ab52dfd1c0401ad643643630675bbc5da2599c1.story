A midwife from Bournemouth appears alongside a US Navy nuclear engineer and a banker from Bulgaria in a new calendar claiming to feature the world's most beautiful single people.

The men and women featured were chosen from more than 45,000 submissions from members of the BeautifulPeople.com website.

Each has had over 12,000 views to their profile - making them the most popular members on the site.

Beautiful Brit: ClaireTravis-Punter, 31, a midwife from Bournemouth, appears in the Beautiful People calendar

Popular: Bulgaria's Teodora Burgazlieva, 28 has had more than 12,000 profile views on the dating site

But despite Bournemouth's unexpected success, it's Los Angeles that appears to be the happiest hunting ground for those in search of a stunning partner, with four calendar stars hailing from the city.

Cover star of the women's calendar, Satine, is a 38-year-old model from LA, while the men's cover star is fellow American Timothy Quinn, 23.

Proving that brawn and brains are a powerful combination are James Lucas, a 25-year-old Henry Cavill lookalike who is a nuclear engineer in the US Navy and Julian Ostensen, a 19-year-old computer engineer from Norway.

To become a member of the site, all 24 beautiful singletons had to endure a 48-hour voting period where members of the opposite sex decided whether they were attractive enough to join their gated community. Only one in eight applications is successful.

Midwife Clare Travis-Punter, 31, who is the only British person to feature in the calendar, said: 'I joined the site 18 months ago and loved the challenge of whether I would be accepted or not.

Striking: Laura Toparceanu 35, hails from Bologna in Italy and is a member of dating site, beautifulpeople.com

Stunning city: Like three other calendar stars, Timothy Quinn, 23, hails from Los Angeles

'Nearly a year and a half on, and I've been selected to appear in the site's 2014 calendar. It's all been very exciting. 

'I've been dating a number of members some of whom I've stayed in contact with, but am still looking to meet someone I really have a connection with.'

BeautifulPeople.com managing director Greg Hodge said: 'The calendar showcases not only the most beautiful, but the most popular single people in the world. 

'Not only did these stunning men and women beat our rating system but their profiles have been viewed more than 12,000 times - making them "Super Beautiful" amongst our online community.

'What strikes me is how many interesting careers our members have; from nuclear engineers to law graduates and teachers, we represent so many fascinating professions; and of course these men and women have the added benefit of being beautiful.'

Cover star Satine, from LA, said: 
'Moving in circles with such beautiful people is a real thrill, and it's
 even more exciting that I've been selected to appear among them in the 
site's 2014 calendar.'

James Lucas, a nuclear engineer in the US Navy, said: 'Will my friends tease me about the calendar? Yes, but in a good way.

'I won't be pinning this one to my locker, but if I get more approaches from single ladies who are not only beautiful on the outside but who are intelligent, then who's complaining?'

The USA was the only country to get six members into the BeautifulPeople.com calendar. Italy, Brazil and France each had two members make the final cut. 

British people in general are among the least successful applicants to the site, with less than 10 per cent gaining access to the exclusive community, compared with a global success rate of 12.5 per cent.

Americans are among the most successful applicants to the site, with a 30 per cent success rate. But even the USA doesn't come close to the most beautiful country of all - Norway, which has an amazing 51 per cent success rate.

Mr Hodge added: 'Americans are immaculately groomed and many take professional portraits. They have got the hang of online dating and what people are looking for when viewing online profiles. 

'I think Americans are the most polished nation in the world and they know how to make the best of what they have got.'

The website has more than 750,000 members and has received over seven million applications worldwide.
