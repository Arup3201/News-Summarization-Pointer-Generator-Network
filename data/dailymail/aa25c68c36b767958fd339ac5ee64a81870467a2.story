Tensions in Ferguson, Missouri calmed Thursday night, following the withdrawl of National Guard troops and the beginning of a grand jury investigation into the death of black teenager Michael Brown.

Protesters continued to gather on West Florissant Ave, near the scene where an unarmed Brown was shot to death by police officer Darren Wilson, but the congregation remained non-violent.

The night of peace came after the announcement from Gov Jay Nixon that he would be puling the National Guard out of the St Louis suburb.

A small band of soldiers with a humvee remained at the Thursday
 night protests, but it was quite a contrast to Monday, when the 
troops hurled several rounds of tear gas into the crowds.

Highway Patrol Capt Ronald S Johnson told the 
St Louis Post-Dispatch that he believes it was the National Guard leaving, 
and a visit yesterday from Attorney General Eric Holder that brought 
peace to the streets of Ferguson.

Holder visited Ferguson on Wednesday, as a grand jury begins to investigate Brown's shooting death.

'I think it shows that the process has begun, and people know the President is watching,' Johnson told the Post-Dispatch.

Racial divisions: The protesters have sought to highlight the level of racism still faced by black people in the U.S.

The National Guard was called out of Ferguson, Missouri today on the orders of Gov Jay Nixon. A small band remained Thursday night to help police another night of protests, though it was much more peaceful

The National Guard helped secure the streets  of the St. Louis suburb for three nights, beginning on Monday, as hundreds of angry residents took to the street and confronted State Troopers in riot gear. Last night, police arrested only a few people in the protest zones - the quietest night so far. 

Gov Nixon says the Guard provided security that allowed cops to restore trust with residents.

Nixon's announcement comes as St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney issued a defiant letter - typed in all caps - saying he refuses to 'walk away' from investigating the racially-charged shooting of black teen Michael Brown by a white Ferguson police officer.

Nixon said the troops have completed their mission, which was helped to provide security while the Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County cops took over

More than 76,000 people have signed a petition demanding that Robert McCulloch be replaced by a special prosecutor. 

In the letter, McCulloch calls on Gov Nixon to make a decision publicly about whether to remove him from the investigation or to support him staying on. He makes clear that he will not resign of his own accord and says the governor is the only one who can force him to step away from the case.  

Since demonstrations began after the August 9 shooting of Michel Brown, authorities have arrested at least 163 people in the protest area in Ferguson, a predominantly black city with 50 white police officers and three black officers.

'The situation has greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside instigators interfering with peaceful protesters, and fewer acts of violence,' the governor said.

The Ferguson Police Department has been effectively relieved of command and the Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County and St. Louis city police are patrolling the streets of the town.

McCulloch, whose police officer father was killed responding to a call about a black suspect, defended his impartiality and said he would not step down from the investigation

After heavy confrontations between riot cops and protesters on Sunday night, Gov Nixon called up the National Guard to shore up security in the city.

Tempers on the streets seem have cooled significantly since then. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that only a few protesters could be seen on the streets Wednesday night into Thursday morning and police stayed mostly in their squad cars parked along Florissant Street - Ground Zero for the protests.

Some question McCulloch's ability to be unbiased since his father, mother and other relatives worked for St. Louis police. His father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.

Nixon said this week he is not asking McCulloch to recuse himself. But a McCulloch aide, Ed Magee, said the governor 'didn't take an actual position one way or the other.'

McCulloch called for a more definitive decision. He said in a statement that Nixon must 'end this distraction' or risk delay in resolution of the investigation.

Federal authorities have launched an independent investigation into Brown's death, and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill told The Associated Press that all of the physical evidence from the case was being flown Thursday from St. Louis to the FBI forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia. The evidence includes shell casings and trajectories, blood patterns and clothing, the Missouri Democrat reported.

'The only thing you have to test the credibility of eye witnesses to a shooting like this is in fact the physical evidence,' McCaskill said. 'I'm hopeful the forensic evidence will be clear and will shed a lot more light on what the facts were.'
