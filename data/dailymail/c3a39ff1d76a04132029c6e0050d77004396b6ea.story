Arsenal are facing another injury nightmare with Aaron Ramsey set to be ruled out for up to four weeks.

The 23-year-old was taken off at half-time against Galatasaray on Tuesday - Ramsey's third game in a week -  after tweaking a hamstring again. He had scored two goals in Turkey, including a 30-yard volley widely hailed as a wonder strike.

It comes as a further blow to manager Arsene Wenger, who will also be missing Jack Wilshere in central midfield for several months.

Arsenal vs Stoke - Jan 11

Ramsey has remained injury-free for the majority of this season and has just started to hit the ground running for the Gunners. As well as his strikes against Galatasaray, Ramsey also scored in last Saturday's defeat at Stoke.

The Welshman will miss two crunch games before Christmas against Newcastle at the weekend and Liverpool on December 21.

Wenger looks likely to be without his star midfielder for at least another four games – trips to West Ham and Southampton, the Boxing Day clash against QPR and an FA Cup third round tie at home to Hull. 

Arsenal then have the chance to gain revenge on Stoke at the Emirates Stadium, and Wenger will be desperate to have Ramsey back to face his old foes.
