One of England's least wanted dogs has finally been rehomed - after almost seven years in kennels.

Jed the lurcher was taken in as a four-month-old puppy in 2007, but instead of quickly settling into a new home, Jed spent the next 50 dog years at the rescue centre as he was overlooked by around 17,000 potential suitors.

Then, just before Christmas, following a MailOnline appeal, Ian Woodcock and Elizabeth Marsh came forward to give the dog a new home.

The couple, both 49, travelled to the Dogs Trust Centre in Darlington and fell in love with Jed, adopting the delighted dog.

Jed now lives in Whitby, North Yorkshire, and spends his days going for long walks on the moors, sleeping by the fire and playing with his new toy collection.

Mr Woodcock, a chemical engineer, said: 'Jed is settling in really well and we absolutely adore him, he is always by my side and we already can't imagine life without him.

'If dogs can have a sense of humour then Jed certainly has one, he is already very attached to my wife and I and he likes to be with us all of the time.

'His new favourite trick involves moving his duvet in front of the door and falling asleep so that we can't leave the room.

'He thoroughly enjoyed his first Christmas as part of the family, especially his favourite roasted bone from the butchers.

'We are really looking forward to the future with Jed, after so long without a home we can't wait to make 2015 as special as possible for him.'

When Jed was taken in by the Dogs Trust it was hoped that as a young puppy he would quickly find a home.

There was interest and a couple of families tried to take him on but on both occasions he had to be returned because he was too energetic.

Beverly Watson, rehoming centre assistant manager at Dogs Trust Darlington, said: 'We are so delighted that Jed had finally found such a fantastic home after searching for so many years.

'He is such a character and we all became so attached to him in all the time he was with us, so it really is the best New Year present we could ask for to see how happy he is with Ian and Elizabeth.

'I've worked in animal welfare for ten years and to see Jed get rehomed is undoubtedly one of the highlights.

'It just goes to show there is a happy home out there for every dog in our care and as Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down we will make sure they find it however long it takes.'
