The supercars parading through London's streets reached a whole new level of extravagance this week when a wealthy Arab rolled his gold Range Rover into town.

The 'Mystere' is a £150,000 version of the famous British vehicle which has been given an overhaul by German tuning house Hamann.

The car's normal design has been replaced with a customised body-kit which includes oversized bumpers and a bonnet vent.

The £150,000 'Hamann Mystere' is one of the most flamboyant vehicles yet to be seen in the capital

It is thought the Range Rover's Saudi owner brought the car over with him for his summer stay in London

Its Saudi owner has also opted for the luxury off-roader, which is fitted with 23-inch alloy wheels, to be kitted out with a black and gold wrap.

The car, with the registration plate '666', has been flown over to the UK by its Saudi owner and is parked outside the expensive Wellesley Hotel in Knightsbridge.

A top-spec Range Rover costs £100,000 - with Hamann charging around £50,000 for the 'Mystere' conversion.

It is one of a number of flamboyant cars which have arrived in London for the summer season, when Middle-Eastern millionaires escape the desert temperatures for a holiday in the UK.

One local resident said: 'Range Rovers don't normally stand out because there are so many of them in London, but this one is different.'

'You can't miss it. It is 
amazing that the owner, who must be quite rich, decided to have it 
wrapped gold coloured. It is so eye-catching, but I don't think it will 
be winning any style awards.

The luxury off-roader was spotted in the car park of the Wellesley Hotel in Knightbridge, opposite Hyde Park

It comes after this ornately-painted Lamborghini Aventador was spotted in the area last summer

The 4x4's gold finish is similar to this Bugati Veyron which was parked outside the Dorchester last year

He added: 'It was parked next to a Rolls-Royce Ghost, and you hardly noticed the Roller. It is not often that a Rolls-Royce looks like the understated car.'

Last year, residents of West London complained the capital was being inundated with supercars, which they claimed were leading to unruly driving.

Petrol-heads were seen driving round wealthy areas of the city in Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugattis and attracting bands of camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi.

Channel 4 made a documentary about the drivers, called Millionaire Boy Racers, after local residents called for a clampdown.

In 2010, a £1.2 million Koenigsegg CCXR 
and £350,000 Lamborghini Murcielago were clamped outside famous 
department store Harrods.

Local residents say their lives have been made a misery by the supercars like these driving around the district

Crowds of tourists watched in disbelief as a traffic warden first ticketed then clamped both vehicles, which were believed to have belonged to the oil-rich Qatari royal family.

It was the first summer in which the so-called 'invasion of Arab supercars' was noticed on London's streets, with a £1 million-plus Bugatti Veyron and a £500,000 Mercedes Benz McLaren SLR, both chrome-finished and with Middle Eastern plates, spotted outside the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge.

It is believed wealthy Arabs from Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia relocate to the capital in the Middle East's hottest summer months and compete over who can show off the most expensive vehicle.

Experts said insuring some the supercars on London's roads can cost more than £50,000-a-year, with a £15,000 excess.

Last summer, a £350,000 purple and orange Lamborghini was seized by the police after the driver was pulled over, again outside Harrods, because of police concerns about his insurance.

Weeks later the same car was seen back on the streets, but was given a parking ticket just days after police handed it back to the owner.
