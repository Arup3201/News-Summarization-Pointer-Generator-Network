Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly is making up to £6,000 a night and is set to pay 40 per cent income tax just months after finding fame as a long-term welfare claimant.

The 43-year-old Benefits Street star charges at least £1,500 an hour to appear at nightclubs and her manager claims she can manage four meet-and-greets a night.

Now she is also being invited to student debating societies after she appeared at the Tory party conference and demanded the government do more to get people into work.

And she has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year - even though it would mean a pay cut.

Hey big spender: Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly, pictured at a Stoke-on-Trent nightclub last week, makes £1,500 an hour and is set to pay 40 per cent  tax just months after life as a long-term welfare claimant made her famous

Tonight alone, the most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street will appear at two nightclubs in Sheffield - a week after she was mobbed by revellers in Stoke-on-Trent.

Her manager Barry Tomes told MailOnline: 'She usually goes for an hour and sits in the VIP area where she's looked after by a couple of doormen.

'Last week we had one where 200 or 300 people queued up to meet her and it took us 45 minutes just to get from the car into the venue.

'Her minimum fee is £1,500 an hour and for a big awards ceremony for example - unless it's for charity - that could double.

'Last week she presented a footballing award and next week she's presenting an award at an Asian community event.'

Well-known: The resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street shot into the headlines on C4's Benefits Street

Long road travelled: This week she appeared at the Tory conference and has been invited to student debates

The mother-of-two shot into headlines in January for her bullish appearances on Channel 4's controversial fly-on-the-wall show Benefits Street.

When she appeared on the documentary her last full-time job had been at Birmingham City Council - from which she was fired in 2007, and narrowly avoided a jail sentence, for stealing £13,000.

She was immediately controversial when she was shown swearing repeatedly at her children and having little motivation to search for a job after years of unemployment.

Change of heart: She said it was 'not fair' for benefits claimints to earn more than minimum-wage workers

In the months after Benefits Street she began cashing in on her notoriety, flying to Magaluf where she downed shots with punters while still claiming sickness benefits.

She then stopped claiming state handouts in May, and has since built a career around her status as a TV personality.

The mother-of-two appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and will feature in a Channel 5 documentary on her new lifestyle from January.

Mr Tomes claimed she is 'easily' earning at the 40 per cent tax rate and has often pulled in fees from several nightclubs a night - though she still makes less than big names from The Only Way is Essex. 

'During the Christmas period where every nightclub wants someone we can do as many as 12 venues,' he said. 'You start with an under-16s disco and you're still doing a gay club at 3.30am.'

The culmination of her unusual new life came on Monday when she appeared at a fringe event at the Tory party conference - and admitted the life she had boasted of living previously was 'unfair'.

She said: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government.

'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that.

'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.' 

She also laid in to government policy, saying: 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,' she said. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon.

'They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.'

Big ambitions: The 43-year-old has still not ruled out standing as an MP - even though it would earn her less

Asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010, she said: 'I have noticed a change. I think it's considerably got worse.'

Miss Kelly has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year, despite reports that she no longer wants to because she earns more as a 'celebrity'.

'I've said she should put it on the back burner for ten years because she wouldn't be able to be as outspoken or do as many appearances', Mr Tomes said.

'Why would she want to be an MP on £60,000 when she would be very restricted on what she would be doing? 

'But she's a strong-willed woman so she won't necessarily listen to me.'

Almost 900 viewers complained to Ofcom after Benefits Street was aired.

Many of them  said the residents had been misrepresented, children were exploited and the show was 'poverty porn' which demonised those on benefits.

In a lengthy decision, the regulator  ruled there had been no breach of the broadcasting code.
