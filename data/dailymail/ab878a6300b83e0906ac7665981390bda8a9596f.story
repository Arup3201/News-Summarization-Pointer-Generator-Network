Everton fans will be in jubilant mood after seeing their side return to winning ways thanks to a 3-1 win against Queens Park Rangers on Monday night. 

The smirk on their faces will be even wider after seeing some of the Toffees' top players appear in a new Christmas video. 

Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Ross Barkley are among the stars who  ask each other jokes you would usually find in a Christmas cracker.
