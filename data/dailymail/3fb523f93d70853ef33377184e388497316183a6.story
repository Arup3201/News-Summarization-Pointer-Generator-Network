When Lisa Reid was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, doctors warned she may never be able to have another child.

The mother-of-one was told she had a rare form of the disease leaving medics no option but to remove her right ovary and fallopian tube.

Specialists warned the procedure would affect the 29-year-old's fertility, making it unlikely she would ever have a sibling for her six-year-old son Jack.

But a year on and Miss Reid and her fiance Thomas Duffy were delighted when they discovered she was expecting another baby.

When Lisa Reid was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer, doctors warned her she would be unlikely to conceive another child, a sibling for her six-year-old son Jack. But a year on and Miss Reid and her fiance Thomas Duffy are delighted she is nine weeks pregnant

She is nine weeks pregnant and next month will tie the knot with Mr Duffy, 28, an accountant.

Miss Reid, from Westerhope in Newcastle, said: 'My life is so much better and I’m completely content and happy.

'It’s strange to think that this time last year I had been diagnosed with cancer, it feels like it didn’t happen to me and it’s someone else who had it.

'I’m living life to the full and feel very lucky at how things are now.'

The mother-of-one’s ordeal began last July when she started to suffer crippling stomach pains and huge swelling to her abdomen.

Her condition became so serious she struggled to fit behind the steering wheel of her car, as her stomach bloated.

Doctors initially put Miss Reid's condition down to a gastric bug, hernia or gall stones.

But tests and scans revealed she had a 20cm Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour growing on one of her ovaries.

The medical team caring for her, told the mother-of-one she would have to undergo a three-hour operation to remove the cancer, followed by nine weeks of intense chemotherapy.

The 29-year-old had an ovary and fallopian tube removed to treat her cancer, and was given the 'all clear' in December. She is set to marry her fiance next month and said they are 'delighted' to be looking forward to welcoming their new arrival

Each year around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK.

Of those cases, it is estimated less than 0.5 per cent are the type of tumour that Miss Reid was diagnosed with.

She said: 'It turned my life upside down.

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours are so rare that there is little known about this form of cancer.

Each
 year, around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK, 
and it is estimated that less than 0.5 per cent of these are 
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (SLCT).

The cancer is a rare ovarian tumour that belongs to the group of sex-cord stromal tumours.

Most
 are confined to the ovaries and usually develop in younger women 
affecting those under the age of 30, however, the cancer is known to 
develop in all ages.

Treatment for SLCT usually involves surgery to remove the affected ovary.

It is estimated that as high as 75 per cent of tumours are detected early and tend to develop in only one ovary.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be required following an operation to remove the tumour.

It
 is believed that SLCT has similar symptoms to that of ovarian cancer, 
these include increased abdominal size; persistent pelvic and abdominal 
pain; feeling full quickly and feeling nauseous.

'I
 felt totally shocked by the diagnosis and it knocked me back like a 
giant wave, but I dealt with it better than I thought I would.'

Doctors feared the cancer may have spread, warning her they may have to perform a hysterectomy, and even remove part of her bowel to ensure the cancer was contained.

But fortunately the drastic step was not necessary, but Miss Reid was still advised her chances of conceiving another child were significantly reduced.

She said: 'At the time the thought of having a hysterectomy did not bother me as I was so focused on being ill that I didn’t care, but I would be devastated now if I had needed a hysterectomy.

'With having only one ovary it was expected that it would be difficult for me to have any more children and chemotherapy also affects the menstrual cycle so my chances of having another child were low.

'I’m so excited and happy to be pregnant and getting married. I’m looking to the future and everything I have ever wanted I have got now.'

Miss Reid is regularly monitored by experts to check that the cancer has not returned.

On her birthday in December she was given the 'all clear'.

'I feel really lucky that I’ve had so much support from those around me,' she said.

'I feel like the old me again, only with a different outlook on life.'

At the weekend Miss Reid took part in Newcastle’s Cancer Research UK Race for Life for the first time with her mother, who has done it in for seven years in memory of her mother who died of lung cancer aged 67 and her best friend who died of skin cancer aged 42.
