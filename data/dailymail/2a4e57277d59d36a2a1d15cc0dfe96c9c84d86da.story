After years cooped up indoors, you might think it's time for your teddy to get out and experience the world around them.

And now, thanks to a Japanese company, that's possible.

Staff at Unagi Travel take groups of up to ten toys on tours around the country - showing them several popular tourist attractions, including hot springs and temples.

For $45 dollars the toys may embark on the Tokyo tour, stopping at five major sightseeing stops in the city.

They will first visit the fashion mecca of Japanese teens, Shibuya, before the Asakusa district and finally soaking up a beautiful view of the city from the Tokyo Tower.

Or if a city break doesn't take their fancy, perhaps a tour of the hot springs - known as Onsen - would be more suitable for $55.

A day and a half tour to Kyoto, the former imperial capital of the country,  is also on offer for $95 - where the toys are taken to sites such as old temples and shrines.

Cultural: Two teddy tourists, with what appear to be make-shift hats on, visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura

For the really adventurous toy out there, there is a $35 mystery tour - which can include a trip on a plane.

Throughout the tours, the toys  sample some of the delicious Japanese cuisine including noodle soups and sushi.

Owners of the stuffed toys will be able to enjoy the experience too, as tour guides make sure every moment is captured on video and through photo.

All toys must be less than 250g. Owners must pay their toy's airfare to Tokyo, but on their return they get a free coach-class ticket.

The company usually targets people who, for some reason, cannot visit the iconic places themselves.

Unagi is not the only company catering for toys with itchy feet.

If your inanimate friend is really stressed out and you want to send it to a relaxing retreat, a travel agency in the Czech Republic offer similar services - but offer massages, aromatherapy and even picnics for an additional cost.

Inspired by the 2001 French hit movie, Amelie, Toy Traveling offer people the chance to send their favorite toys on a memorable journey through Prague.

For an extra 60 euros on top of a 90-euro fee, toys can have a massage, aromatherapy and even a picnic.

But perhaps the most adventurous toy of all is Curious George - the teddy who has been travelling for five years.

Curious George has travelled around the world with its owner, visiting Sydney to Singapore, London and all across America.

He has been snapped hanging out at the Sydney Harbour Bridge, drinking beer in Germany, posing for pictures on the River Thames and in the cat cafes of Tokyo.
