Maria Sharapova's boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov showed off his softer side on Sunday when he stopped his Sony Open match to tend to a young ball girl who was struggling with the 90-degree heat in Miami.

Dimitrov was in a first set tie-breaker with Kei Nishikori when he walked towards the ball girls asking for a towel.

'Towel, please - towel please,' Dimitrov was forced to repeat himself when the girl didn't appear to spring into action and rush him a towel.

It was then that Dimitrov appeared to notice that the girl seemed ill.

The 16th-ranked tennis player in the world then took the girl's hand and walked her over to a bench, where the medical staff could take a look at her - and it was all captured on film.

Tennis, unfortunately doesn't award points for being a nice guy - Dimitrov lost his match, but certainly gained some points in the arena of public opinion.

In addition to being Sharapova's boyfriend, Dimitrov gained notoriety in his early years for having a style of play similar to Roger Federer's.

In fact, the similarities earned him the nickname 'Baby Fed.'

Federer, however, was no fan of the nickname, telling reporters in October 'I hope people don’t call him Baby Fed so often anymore. At first it’s funny, but it gets annoying.'
