Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg has announced that he and his wife Vivian are expecting their first child, a baby girl, in August.

Rosberg, who finished 67 points behind Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in last year's drivers championship standings, announced the news on his social media accounts on Friday. 

'Exciting time for our little family,' the 29-year-old German Rosberg, who tied the knot with his childhood sweetheart last year, wrote.

'Vivian is pregnant and if all goes well we will get a little baby girl in August.'

Lewis Hamilton only completed 11 laps before having to withdraw from Thursday's practice with illness 

Rosberg, the son of 1982 world champion Keke, made the announcement ahead of his first day of testing in Barcelona.

The German brushed off a trapped nerve in his neck to take to the Mercedes cockpit and gain valuable mileage ahead of the new season which starts next month. 

On Thursday, Hamilton was forced to withdraw from proceedings, citing a high temperature. He had completed only 11 laps in an hour of testing, before having to stop.

Mercedes are hopeful the Brit will resume testing duties, as planned, on Saturday.
