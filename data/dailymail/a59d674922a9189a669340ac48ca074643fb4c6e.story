Frank Lampard has revealed that the villains in his children’s story books are based on team-mates.

The former Chelsea midfielder has penned a series of books - Frankie's Magic Football - which tell the tales of a group of friends who are whisked off on incredible adventures by a magical football.

And, when asked who provided the inspiration for the bad guys, Lampard, who played alongside the likes of John Terry and Ashley Cole, said: 'Some of the characters in my series are based on the team members I play football with.

Villains? Frank Lampard says the baddies in his story books are based on team-mates

His biggest inspiration: Football ace Frank Lampard says that his greatest inspiration in life, and behind his children's books, is his mother Pat, right, who passed away in 2008

‘It's always fun to think about who could be the next character when I'm playing football with them.'

And 
revealing how he researches the ideas for his books, which are aimed at 
five-year-olds and older, Lampard went on: 'My stories are about 
football and fantasy, with a bit of magic thrown in.

'This 
means that most of the research comes from my own experiences on the 
pitch, combined with where I think that it would be cool to play a 
football match. Like on a pirate ship, or in ancient Egypt!'

Lampard also says that his biggest inspiration is his mother Pat, who died aged 58 following a short bout of pneumonia in 2008.

'My mum, who sadly passed away, will always be my biggest inspiration,’ he said.

But 
Lampard, who has two children with his former fiancee, Spanish model 
Elen Rivas, added: 'I feel most inspired at home with my daughters.

'Thinking 
about what they would like to read helps me to come up with ideas. So, 
often inspiration comes to me when I'm reading to them, or telling them 
made-up stories.

'Chatting to my daughters and hearing the often funny things that they come up with helps me to get creative.'

Talents: While he may be Chelsea's best ever goalscorer, Frank has also written children's books, right
