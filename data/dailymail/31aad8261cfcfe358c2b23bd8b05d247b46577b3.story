The green taxes that account for nearly 10 per cent of spiralling energy bills will be ‘rolled back’ before the next election, David Cameron pledged yesterday.

He shocked MPs by announcing that the Government is to tear up environmental levies which add £112 a year to the average household’s annual bills.

The move prompted consternation among his Lib Dem coalition colleagues, who accused him of a ‘panicky U-turn’. The Prime Minister gave them only half an hour’s notice of the announcement.

Senior sources told the Mail that environmental schemes seen as important – such as offering pensioners and those with energy-inefficient homes help with insulation – were likely to be switched to general taxation.

Others could be scrapped altogether. Mr Cameron’s dramatic announcement came as he faced rising pressure to act on inflation-busting increases in gas and electricity bills.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed a 1970s-style, 20-month price freeze to be imposed on energy firms, while former  Conservative prime minister Sir John Major this week suggested a windfall tax on their profits.

Instead, Mr Cameron told the Commons that household bills were at ‘unacceptable levels’– and green taxes would have to give.

‘We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down,’ he told MPs.

‘We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills.

‘I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place.’

Details of the measures were scant yesterday. But they are likely to form part of Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement on December 4.

Number 10 sources insisted they would be put in place before the election in 2015.

The Prime Minister also announced a new annual review of competition in the energy sector, a move aides said could lead to the break up of the six big energy giants.

Downing Street sources said green taxes would account for 14 per cent of bills by 2020, or £194 a year for the average household, and Labour’s plan to sign up to further commitments to reduce carbon emissions would add another £125 a year.

They rejected the charge of an overnight U-turn, pointing out that Mr Osborne had been speaking publicly of the need to rein in environmental levies for 18 months.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron's old invitation to 'vote blue, go green'

But Mr Miliband, who introduced a series of environmental levies as Energy Secretary in the last government, said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron’s old invitation to ‘vote blue, go green’.

A senior Lib Dem said: ‘Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked up policies in front of us.

‘But we will not allow a panicky 
U-turn during PMQs to dictate Government policy. The way to provide 
stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the 
hoof.’

In the Commons, 
Mr Miliband also raised a Number 10 aide’s hastily withdrawn response 
last week, in which he agreed people might consider ‘wearing woolly 
jumpers’ to help bring energy bills down, though the aide said Mr 
Cameron would never ‘prescribe’ such advice.

Number
10 said the Prime Minister had ‘never said it, never thought it’ and it
was ‘totally inappropriate’ for Mr Miliband to raise it.

Four in five low income households are worried about the cost of heating their homes this winter, according to Citizens’ Advice.

It
added that two in three poorer families and pensioners are being forced
to live in cold conditions because they cannot afford to put the 
heating on.
