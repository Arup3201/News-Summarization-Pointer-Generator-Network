They are the notorious jihadist group who have viciously  slaughtered seven hostages on video and spread terror throughout the Middle East.

But Isis - now a byword for extremist brutality - is also the name of an Egyptian goddess… and one very unlucky 13-year-old schoolgirl.

Isis Boorman-Tuck is one of hundreds of people nationwide who share a name with the terrifying group who are gloried in videos showing the horrific beheading of hostages.

And even though she suffers taunts as a result of the unfortunate link, she is determined not to change her name and is even considering passing it on to her children.

Across the world, people and businesses are regretting choosing the name Isis since the 2013 formation of the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

But this is not the case for the Boorman-Tucks - mum Serena, dad Philip, Isis and her siblings Zeon, 20, and 11-year-old twins India and Symika - from Hythe in Kent who embrace individuality.

‘To be honest, I love my name and I don’t really mind it’s the same as Islamic State because Isis was an Egyptian goddess and that came before,' the 13-year-old said.

'People have made jokes about it saying I’m a terrorist, but I just take it as a joke.

‘One of my friends posted on Facebook “Isis please don’t blow me away”. I don’t really mind.'

Isis said the situation in Iraq and Syria - a topic she has covered in her travel and tourism classes - is 'terrible'.

She admits she daydreams in lessons and regulary snaps back to reality when ISIS is mentioned.

Mum Serena stands by her decision to call her daughter Isis, and she gave her other siblings similarly unusual names.

In Ancient Egypt, Isis was worshipped as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. 

'We like Egypt and that's where we holiday,' she said. 'The name just sounded really nice.

'People normally just said "it's really nice" and ask what the meaning is. There is nothing horrible.

'Boys make jokes on Facebook like "you blow me away". 

'To her, it's her name and they (ISIS) have nicked it. She gets quite excited because her name is on the TV.

'You could look into loads of different names and find someone bad who has got that name.' 

The Year 9 student at Brockhill Park Performing Arts College in Hythe, who said some people think she's made her name up, doesn't think parents of children called Isis have anything to worry about.

‘It’s just a name, it’s not like anyone is going to hurt them or anything,' she said. ‘They should feel proud and individual.’ 

Terrorists: Across the world, people and businesses are regretting choosing the name Isis since the 2013 formation of the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal there were 390 baby girls named Isis in England and Wales over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013.

This includes 46 girls In 2013, despite the actions of the terrorist group reported almost daily.

More than 40,000 people have signed the Thousands of Women and Girls Named Isis, Petition Media to Stop Calling the Terrorists by Our Name petition, started by U.S. woman Isis Martinez.

'You can help save the name of #ThousandsofWomenNamedIsis and save us from the backlash of being associated with this horrific terrorist group of monsters,' Ms Martinez wrote in a post on the online petition page.

'Little girls, especially in the United States, named Isis have reported bullying while women with the name are facing negative associations through their employment and in public places like airports, airplanes even at times being called terrorists themselves.'

The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic.

She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology.

Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives.

It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. 

The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. 

Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion.

She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute.

The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.
