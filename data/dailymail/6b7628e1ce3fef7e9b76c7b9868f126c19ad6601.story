A father whose 14-year-old daughter was killed by a stray bullet fired during a drive-by shooting has made an emotional plea for any information about her murderer.

Jason Stille said his  daughter Railena Rhodes was sleeping inside her mother's home in Moore, Oklahoma early on Saturday morning when a bullet struck her in the neck.

'You took the life of a 14-year-old girl,' Stille said to the killer, KOCO reported. 'She had her whole life. It's stupid. I mean, you destroyed an entire family.

'If anybody knows anything about it, tell us, tell somebody. This was an innocent person. This person was taken for no reason. This family needs closure. We can't have closure unless they're caught.'

Police said that Railena - known as Rosemarie to her friends - was asleep in a bedroom at her mother's home while a dozen people gathered at a party downstairs. 

But one of Railena's friends, Destiny Abshure, told KOCO that Railena was actually awake and was about to intervene in an argument her brother was having when bullets were fired at the house. 

'She was holding her throat, just gasping for air and she just fell and hit the ground,' Abshure said. 'I seen the hole in her throat when she went down.'

Sadness: She is pictured with her father, Jason Stille, who has appealed for information on her killer

Speaking out: Mr Stille, pictured left with his wife during a Skype call with KOCO, said that his family desperately needs closure and called upon anyone with any information to step forward

Her brother then entered the room and 'started freaking out', Abshure said.

Police arrived at the home shortly before 4am on Saturday and found the teenager killed. Bullets had been shot through walls and windows, according to reports.

Authorities told Newson6 that Railena lived with her grandmother but was at her mother's home for a visit. 

Witnesses gave police a description of a car that was seen leaving and authorities caught up with it and questioned the people inside, but no arrests have yet been made.

Friends expressed their disbelief that Railena had been taken so suddenly. 

'She makes me laugh,' her best friend Savanah Miller said. 'I still don't believe it happened... Of all the people there, why did it have to be her?'

Anyone with information on the shooting can call Crime Stoppers at 405-793-5160.
