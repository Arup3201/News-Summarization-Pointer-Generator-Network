Children's diseases tend to spread across America from one coast to another, researchers say.

They plotted the progress of a range of conditions including Diptheria, Scarlet Fever and Polio.

They say the weather is key to the spread. 

Scarlet fever peaked in Rhode Island a month later than in Alabama, Bakker found -and epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country. The colours represent the number of cases - with dark blue being worst hit, and white having no cases.

Scarlet Fever epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country.

Diphtheria epidemics peaked in Nov-Dec in the SE USA, and Jan-Feb in the rest of the country.

With Typhoid Fever, a summer epidemic, the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the Southern US (August) occurring about a month prior to more Northern states (September).

This same pattern in epidemic timing was seen in Polio, with August peaks in the South, and late September peaks in the North. 

'I was interested in examining whether the timing of these childhood infections peaked at different times of the year across a spatial scale,' Kevin Bakker, who led the study at the University of Michigan, told MailOnline.

He found that in the United States, the wintertime epidemics hit first in the Southeast, and then spread northward during the 1920s to the 1950s.

For example, scarlet fever peaked in Rhode Island a month later than in Alabama, Bakker found.

Diphtheria followed the same pattern, but the disease spiked about a month before scarlet fever. 

'Interestingly, in the case of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever, epidemics peaked in the American Southeast a few months prior to the rest of the country,' Bakker said. 

The study relies on more than a century of newly digitized infectious-disease records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide a comprehensive view of disease patterns

Researchers hope the maps could help spot the diseases spreading in future outbreaks.

'Overall, I am interested in the mechanisms driving these patterns, and why we see these geographic patterns in these 4 diseases. 

'This is important because many of these diseases are still endemic in parts of the world, and understanding why the epidemics are peaking across space could help us reduce this disease burden.'

Scarlet Fever epidemics peaked in Dec-Jan in the SE USA and Feb-Mar in the rest of the country, Bakkar said, while Diphtheria epidemics peaked in Nov-Dec in the SE USA, and Jan-Feb in the rest of the country.

With Typhoid Fever, a summer epidemic, the pattern was latitudinal with epidemics in the Southern US (August) occurring about a month prior to more Northern states (September).
