Three people have been accused of stealing bronze vases from the grave sites of babies and military veterans to sell as scrap metal.

Marissa Dawn Savage, Brian Keith Hicks and Samantha Diane Mathis have each been charged withÂ  two counts of theft by taking, for allegedly stealing 29 vases from Georgia's Hill Haven Cemetery.

Although the vases were worth about $500 each, the alleged robbers only made about $65 in total before they were caught by a potential buyer.

Family members who had purchased the 
flower vases to sit as mementos at the burial sites of their loved ones 
are devastated at the news.

Rita White's grandson died in her daughter's arms seven hours after he was born in 1991, and he was buried at Hill Haven Cemetery.

White said when she discovered thieves had vandalized the little boy's grave, she re-lived the grief she experienced more than 20 years ago.

'That's where we come to have peace and think about him. It's been a long time but he was still our baby,' she told My Fox Atlanta.

'My daughter and I both have cried about this (the thefts) because that was my first grandbaby. That was her first baby. And to think that people are that low that they would do something like that.'

Cemetery owner Betty Cornett said she was disgusted that anyone would rob a grave.

'They got $65 for I don't know how many vases. It's stupidity,' Cornett said.

'That
 just broke my heart because I've lost a baby. I know how that feels. I 
am just amazed that people are that low that they would something like 
this from babies and veterans.'

According to The Atlanta Constitution-Journal, Cornett reported the thefts to police on February 28.

Several family members of people whose graves were vandalized also called cops.

Grieving: Families already mourning the loss of their loved ones have been left devastated by the spate of graveyard robberies

The trio was arrested earlier this month after trying to sell pieces of the vases, which they had smashed, to a buyer who realized where they came from. The buyer called police.

The three were each charged with theft by taking, but Savage was also charged with one count of theft by deception.

Walton County's Sheriff's Office said two other grave sites - in Monroe and Winder - were also robbed.

It is not clear how the three alleged thieves knew each other or when they hatched the plan.
