Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has defended the club's decision to sell Angel di Maria to Manchester United this summer, claiming the Argentina star's  style of play sometimes hindered his side.

Di Maria moved to Old Trafford for a British record £60million fee in August after helping Real seal their 10th European crown last term.

The 26-year-old played an integral role in their triumph in Lisbon but Ancelotti believes the midfielder's knack of 'losing control' at times, when in possession, meant the sale was justified.

Ancelotti also added that Real's £63m signing James Rodriguez, the World Cup's top goalscorer, shouldn't be seen as a direct replacement for Di Maria as they both have different playing styles.

Speaking in an interview with Onda Cero, Ancelotti said: 'Di Maria could take matches by storm with his energy, but he also used to lose control sometimes, misplacing important passes.

'People should think twice before saying that James can fill Di Maria's boots, because they're very different players.'

Di Maria made a bright start  at United scoring three goals in his first five matches.

However, his form has tailed off and he looked lethargic in the last match against Crystal Palace.
