Liverpool recorded a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace to earn a place in the quarter-final of the FA Cup thanks to goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana.

Jordan Henderson and Emre Can led the way for Liverpool in a strong display, while Joe Allen's performance was another hint that the midfield will be strong when Steve Gerrard departs at the end of the season. 

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his review of each player's display from the cup tie at Selhurst Park.

Crystal Palace

Julian Speroni - 7

A busy night for the Argentine, who eventually cracked under intense Liverpool pressure.

Martin Kelly - 6.5

Playing against his former club, the right-back had a steady 63 minutes before being replaced.

Scott Dann - 7

A tower of strength for the Eagles but it wasn't enough as the visitors' pressure told. 

Brede Hangeland - 6.5

His experience was invaluable as Palace came under heavy pressure from the visitors.

Brede Hangeland's experience helped to guide Palace through some tough spells against Liverpool

Pape Souare - 6.5 

The debutant's heart would have been in his mouth when Sturridge fell under his challenge in the box. 

Yannick Bolasie - 6

Not the impact of earlier in the season as Moreno did well to deal with his threat. 

Joel Ward - 6.5

Palace's Mr Versatile slotted into central midfield seamlessly. Kept things ticking over without being spectacular.

Dwight Gayle (centre) takes on Joe Allen (left) and Can (right) in a lively display for Palace

Joe Ledley - 6.5

His well-flighted pass led to Palace's opener and had a tidy game in the home side's engine room.

Dwight Gayle - 6.5 

His movement caused Liverpool problems, but he'll have nightmares about his missed chance late in the first half.

Marouane Chamakh - 7

An absolute class act while on the pitch, but was subbed with an injury at half-time. 

Fraizer Campbell - 6.5

Produced a nice finish to open the scoring but struggled to get involved at times.

Subs: Puncheon (on for Chamakh, 46) 6; Guediora 6 (for Kelly 63); Zaha 6 (for Bolasie 72)

Subs not used: Hennessey, Mariappa, Murray, Delaney

Alan Pardew - 6.5 

LIVERPOOL

Simon Mignolet - 7

Partly at fault for Palace's opener but didn't more than enough to redeem himself.

Emre Can - 7.5

An all action display for the central midfielder turned centre-back. A real driving force.

Martin Skrtel - 6.5

His dreadful header led to Campbell's opener but recovered to ease Liverpool home.

Mamadou Sakho - 6.5 

Not the most graceful in position but did what was necessary of him at the back. 

Lazar Markovic - 6

Failed to have much of an impact before being subbed off at half-time. 

Alberto Moreno - 6.5

An energetic display from the Spaniard. Did well to minimise Bolasie's threat.

Jordan Henderson produced an assured performance in the heart of the midfield for Liverpool

Joe Allen (left) was an important cog in Liverpool's play as they came from behind to beat Palace

Jordan Henderson - 8 

Stood up well to midfield battle and supplied excellent pass for Sturridge's leveller. 

Joe Allen - 7

Not particularly eye-catching but an important cog in Liverpool's midfield alongside Henderson. Heir to Gerrard's throne.

Adam Lallana - 7

Showed his intelligence throughout and showed quickness of though to score Liverpool's second.

Philippe Coutinho - 7.5 

Brilliant player to watch. At the hub of everything good about Liverpool's attacking performance.

Daniel Sturridge - 7

Excellent finish to put his side level. Slowly but surely regaining full fitness at an important point in the season.

Subs: Balotelli (on for Markovic 46) 7; Lambert (for Sturridge 79) 6; Lovren (for Coutinho 79) 6

Subs not used: Ward, Johnson, Manquillo, Borini

Brendan Rodgers - 7
