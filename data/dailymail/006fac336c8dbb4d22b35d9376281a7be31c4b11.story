Fake camera: Chris Fawcett installed the replica on the A303 to encourage tourists to slow down

Villagers who built a fake speed camera in a desperate bid to slow traffic caused by the new Stonehenge visitors centre have been threatened with legal action.

Chris Fawcett has been warned to remove the home-made replica camera from beside a narrow road through the Shrewton, Wiltshire, within seven days or face court proceedings.

Mr Fawcett built the speed camera in a last-ditch effort to slow daytrippers attempting to dodge congestion on the main A303 road brought about by the Stonehenge visitors centre, which has seen 500,000 tourists in six months.

The £27m centre was opened in December 2013 around 1.5 miles from the site of Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument which forms part of a World Heritage Site.

As part of the development the A334, which ran directly past the site, was closed and dug up, forcing all visitor traffic onto the A303, the main commuter route form the M5 to the M3 motorways.

Residents of Shrewton, which runs parallel to the A303, reported a dramatic spike in the amount of drivers diverting through the village and ignoring its 30mph speed limit.

Mr Fawcett, a father of three, said the fake speed camera - made from an old Ikea cabinet painted yellow - has been a success and he has been heaped with praise by residents.

However Wiltshire Council claims the dummy device has been put up illegally on land they own and it has to be taken down because it was not officially installed.

Mr Fawcett, 49, a car mechanic, said: 'Since the visitors centre has been open the A303 has become incredibly congested and that in turn has made the road through Shrewton into a rat run for drivers trying to dodge queues. 

'We have seen traffic levels through the village rise significantly to the point where people who live here are worried to walk down the road for fear of being hit by a speeding car.

Warning: Mr Fawcett has been told by the council to remove the camera or face legal action

The speed camera was built to deter tourists from speeding along back roads to Stonehenge visitors centre 

'Not only has the road become heavy with traffic but there's no regard for speed limits. There have been numerous crashes in the last six months and several cats have been killed after being hit by cars.

'One driver was clocked doing 63mph through the village. People fear for their safety.

'The council says it has a robust approach to tackling speeding but they haven't done anything to stop it.

'Everyone who lives here is fed up of it so I decided to take matters into my own hands before someone got seriously hurt.

'I built a dummy speed camera with my eight-year-old son Jake and we put it up on land owned by my next door neighbour. Straight away it had an impact on the speed people drove through the village.

The £27m Stonehenge visitors centre has already attracted 500,000 tourists since it opened six months ago

'I have had villagers coming up to me to thank me for what I've done because it's had such an effect.

'Then I got a visit from someone from the council threatening me with legal action if I don't take the camera down within seven days. They claim it is on their land but I have seen my next door neighbour's deeds which show the land is his.

'If the council want to take me to court over this one I'm willing to fight them. I'm just waiting for them to present something in writing.

'I cannot fathom why, if this simple safety measure is working, they are intent on taking it down yet they aren't doing anything about it themselves.'

A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said: 'The council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities.

'Issues should be referred to the local community area board, who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road.

'The considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme, installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures.

'It is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result. The council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs.'
