Paul Scholes has insisted that Arsene Wenger was right to say he would have 'loved to play' with Mesut Ozil.

Wenger last week hit back at Scholes for his 'wrong statement' after the Manchester United legend had accused Arsenal midfielder Ozil of 'going through the motions' during his time with the Gunners.

And Scholes has now responded to Wenger's claim after Ozil helped Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup sixth round at Old Trafford on Monday night.

Scholes wrote in The Independent: 'I found myself agreeing with Arsene Wenger on Monday night.

'The Arsenal manager said last Friday that I would have loved to have played alongside Mesut Ozil – and that would be right, as long as Ozil played every week as well as he did at Old Trafford.

'Arsenal impressed me against United, and that has been a rarity in recent years. There were similarities with their performance against Manchester City in January.

'They looked sharp and hungry, full of energy in midfield where they overpowered United. They looked physically commanding too, and Danny Welbeck’s pace and power were important.

'Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin were the pick of the team in my opinion. I never had them down as so strong. They were quick and aggressive and got the better of United.

'They showed Van Gaal’s team what they were lacking in midfield and, funnily enough, they were not afraid to be direct with their attacks when it suited them.'
