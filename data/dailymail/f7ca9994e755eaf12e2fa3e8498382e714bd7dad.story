As Princess Eugenie begins her new job - and new life - in New York, it's likely that her mother Sarah Ferguson is feeling the pangs of separation.

So it is little wonder that the Duchess of York flew over to New York with her youngest daughter this week to help her settle in the Big Apple.

And as any mother knows, few things work better at soothing nerves and feelings of homesickness than a little retail therapy and the pair indulged after Eugenie finished a day of work at her new job at online auction house Paddle8.

Though it is not known if the pair bought anything inside, when they left Sarah was carrying several bags

Sarah, 53, was seen on Tuesday 
shopping with Princess Eugenie in exclusive boutique Pamela Gonzales, 
situated in Soho opposite the Soho Grand hotel.

The
23-year-old princess looked every inch the groomed New Yorker as she 
left her new job at Paddle8 in Little Italy in a navy, baby-doll dress 
with a spotted skirt that fell just above her knees.

She wore simple navy ballet pumps, and kept warm with a black leather jacket.

Eugenie
was on trend with a leather satchel bag slung over her shoulder, and 
she kept her auburn hair tied off her face in a low pony tail.

The
Duchess of York also looked stylish in a simple round-necked red dress 
which she wore with a long knitted jacket and nude pumps.

The Pamela Gonzales store stocks up-market independent designers such as Alice Yim, Jess Rizzuti and Carlos Luna.

While it is not known if the pair bought anything, Sarah was seen leaving the boutique carrying several large white shopping bags. 

The day after the mother-daughter retail therapy, Eugenie packed in lunch with her new boss (and friend of Prince William and Harry) Alexander Gilkes, before more parent time at dinner with her father.

Despite being divorced, Eugenie's parents have always remained good friends and have both been devoted parents, successfully sharing custody of Eugenie and her older sister Princess Beatrice, 25.

Throughout Sarah Duchess of York and Prince Andrew's separation in 1992 and subsequent divorce in 1996, the couple have remained on good terms.

Sarah spoke out about her relationship with her ex-husband Prince Andrew just last week.'He'll always be my handsome Prince,' said the Duchess at a promotional event for her latest children's book.She went on to tell the audience of her own fairytale, which she said 'has a happy ending'.

The appearance of both of Princess Eugenie’s parents in New York this week has sparked speculation about whether the pair met up during their stateside trip, and even if a reconciliation might be on the cards.

Might there be a 'happy ending' to this royal fairytale?
