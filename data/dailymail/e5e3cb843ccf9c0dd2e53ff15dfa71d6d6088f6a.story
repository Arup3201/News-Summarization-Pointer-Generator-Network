Major industries will quit Britain if fracking is not made an urgent priority, peers claim.

Shale gas drilling has been held up by complex rules and exaggerated environmental fears, a report by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee says.

Its chairman Lord MacGregor said: ‘Potentially it’s a remarkable opportunity for this country. We believe the Government needs to get its act together.’

A 100-page report has been highly critical of the Government¿s failure to get fracking under way, despite the claim by Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, to be 'all out for shale'

Industries using large amounts of energy – steel, petrochemical and heavy manufacturing – could leave Britain in the search for cheaper supplies, putting 250,000 jobs at risk, the report said.

Peers also backed moves by the Government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people’s property without their permission.

The 100-page document is highly critical of the Government’s failure to get fracking under way, despite the Prime Minister’s claim to be ‘all out for shale’.

Lord MacGregor, said: ‘Here in the UK we have not yet left the starting gate.

‘Developing a successful shale gas and oil industry in the UK must be an urgent national priority.'

Not a single application to hydrologically fracture has been received by the Environment Agency since a moratorium on the industry was lifted in 2012, the peers said.

They also backed moves by the Government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people’s property without their permission to ensure development could go ahead ‘without undue delay or cost’.

And they said the successful development of shale gas and oil in the UK could reduce the country’s reliance on energy imports from places such as Russia and improve energy security.

The industry could also ‘dampen’ expected gas price rises, they concluded.

Their report says: ‘Substantial shale gas production in the UK could help retain and develop energy intensive industries and provide feedstock to petrochemical plants.

‘If however there is no prospect that the UK’s shale gas resource will be developed within a reasonable timescale, energy intensive industry is likely to move elsewhere.’

Exploring for shale gas has been held up by a 'dauntingly complex' regulatory system and 'much exaggerated' environmental fears, sparking protests like the ones seen here in Balcombe, West Sussex

The report cited Tom Crotty, executive director of energy firm Ineos, who had told the committee: ‘Energy intensive users employ almost a quarter of a million people in this country, and I believe that without this sort of development we will no longer be able to do that in 10 or 15 years’ time.’

Greenpeace UK chief scientist Dr Doug Parr criticised the report, warning fracking was a ‘non-solution’ that would not deliver for many years, if at all.

Ken Cronin, chief executive of the UK Onshore Operators Group, which represents fracking firms, said: ‘The onshore oil and gas industry is ready and willing to step up to the challenge set by the Lords of developing a shale gas industry that can be of great benefit to the UK economy.’

Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said the report would be considered 'carefully'.

'This report
sets out that shale gas development has huge potential to provide the UK with
greater energy security, investment and jobs,' he said.

'This government
has made great progress creating a tax regime and simplifying regulation in a
way that fosters the UK’s emerging shale gas industry and protects the public.'
