Sheffield United could be fined for their late arrival at Tottenham which delayed the start of the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final.

United were delayed by bad traffic from their pre-match hotel in North London – and the Football League have written to South Yorkshire club for a formal explanation of how it happened.

Competition rules state team-sheets must be handed to the referee by the manager and captain no later than 75 minutes before scheduled kick-off.

Nigel Clough and his players did not arrive at White Hart Lane until 40 minutes before the original kick-off time of 7.45pm, for Wednesday's game, which Spurs won 1-0.

The kick-off was delayed by 15 minutes and afterwards Clough said: 'It took us longer to do the five miles than it took us to get to London from Sheffield.'
