Evo-Stik League Premier Division Blyth Spartans have been handed a local derby in the FA Cup second round as they travel to face Hartlepool.

The seventh-tier outfit overcame Altrincham at the weekend and will now make the short trip to face a Pools side who sit bottom of Sky Bet League Two.

The lowest ranked team left in the competition are Warrington of Evo-Stik Division One North and they have been handed a trip to Vanarama Conference Gateshead as reward for defeating League Two Exeter.

Spartans boss Tom Wade is now looking forward to a sell-out clash over the weekend of December 5, 6 and 7.

'There'll be a lot there,' he told BBC Two. 'It'll probably be a sell out. We'll be looking forward to it.

'We'll play anybody, we're in the hat, we've got a chance. I think everybody has got a chance and we've just got to there and give everything we've got.' 

Warrington manager Shaun Reid was glad to avoid a league team and was confident his side would approach the match in the same manner as they did their first-round tie.

'It's a good draw for us,' he said. 'They're a decent side.

'We've just got to go about it the the way we went the other day.'

He added: 'We can't go into any game with fear. We're in the FA Cup and that thing over there just brings out the best in people.

'We'll go (there) confident and give a good account of ourselves and have a right good go.'

Conference North Worcester were another of the weekend's giant killers as they knocked out League One Coventry and they will next face more third-tier opposition in Scunthorpe.

'It's another tough draw on the road again,' said manager Carl Heeley.

'We're just delighted to be here, same as yesterday, just go and give a good account of ourselves and you never know, it's a magic competition.

'We're in there and we've every chance. There's no fear for us there.'
