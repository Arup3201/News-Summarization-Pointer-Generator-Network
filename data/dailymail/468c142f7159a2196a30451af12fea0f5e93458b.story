Jack Russell terrier Jack who needed surgery after swallowing 111 coins

A New York dog had to undergo a two-hour life saving operation - after swallowing more than 100 coins.

The Jack Russell named Jack is recovering at his Wall Street home after he was rushed to a vet's in Manhattan last week after eating 111 pennies and quickly becoming ill.

The coins had to be taken out of 13-year-old terrier Jack's stomach five at a time after he accidentally swallowed the $1.11.

The dog managed to accidentally lick up the coins while eating the remains of a bagel on his owner's desk.

His owner Tim Kellehar knew that something was wrong when his pet began vomiting, according to the New York Daily News.

When his condition worsened over the next 24 hours, Mr Kellehar took Jack to BluePearl Veterinary Partners specialty and emergency hospital in Manhattan where an x-ray showed the cause of the dog's illness.

Jack was placed under anaesthetic and the coins were slowly and methodically removed.

Although the dog has shown no further ill effects since his surgery, vets say that his unusual dinner could have proved fatal.

The zinc from the coins could have lethally damaged the dog's liver and kidneys.

Mr Kellehar told the New York Daily: 'He’s like a voracious Tasmanian devil — if there’s food, he’s got to get it.

'He climbed on my desk to get at the bag with the bagel and knocked the change all over the floor.

'While he was licking up the crumbs, he swallowed the pennies.'

Jack's owner added that he is making a good recovery and driving him crazy again.
