Former Labour Education Secretary David Blunkett has drawn up a raft of proposals on improving schools

Schools would face tighter admissions rules and close scrutiny from ‘standards tsars’ under sweeping Labour proposals for reforming state education.

Ministers accused Labour of attempting to bring back tiers of bureaucracy after the party unveiled plans for dozens of new local directors overseeing heads and governors.

Schools would also face an admissions crackdown to stop middle-class pupils dominating places at sought-after schools.

Watchdogs will be able to force governors to rewrite their admissions policies. Schools will also be required to operate within local rules amid evidence of ‘widespread non-compliance’ with a national code designed to prevent covert selection.

The plans represent Labour’s answer to the academy and free school revolution led by Education Secretary Michael Gove, which has freed hundreds of heads from local authority control.

Under Labour’s blueprint, all schools in an area – including academies and free schools – will be overseen by ‘directors of school standards’ with the power to intervene.

They would be responsible for 
driving up performance in struggling schools - including those merely 
coasting or ‘fragile’ - and responding to the views of parents and the 
wider public.

They would be expected to team up failing schools with stronger neighbours and ultimately force changes of leadership.

Parents concerned about standards in schools will also be able to demand that directors take action.

They will be able to call in a new 
standards supremo to tackle under-performance under plans expected to 
form the centrepiece of Labour’s manifesto for education.

The plans were drawn up by David Blunkett, Tony Blair’s first education secretary, who said the overhaul was aimed at reversing the ‘ridiculous situation’ of schools being run from Whitehall.‘New local Directors of School Standards will monitor, support and challenge schools to improve, driving up standards in underperforming and “fragile” schools – irrespective of the status of the school,’ he said .

But a spokesman for Mr Gove said: ‘We are taking power over schools from politicians and giving it to the heads and teachers who know the children’s names. Sadly, Labour’s announcement today means going in the opposite direction.’

In
 further measures proposed by Mr Blunkett, recommendations for 
tightening admissions would lead to the Office of the Schools 
Adjudicator being able to direct schools to change their policies.

His
 report also said schools should be barred from opting out of 
locally-agreed admissions rules, although they would still be able to 
set their own policies.

Shadow
 Education Secretary Tristram Hunt yesterday accepted Mr Blunkett’s 
proposal to introduce standards tsars, while other plans remain under 
consideration. He claimed that under Mr Gove schools were being left to 
‘sink or swim’.

Mr Hunt said: 'David’s record on raising school standards speaks for itself. This is an incredibly important report.

'Under
 Michael Gove schools are being left to ‘sink or swim’ – more than 1.5m 
children are in underperforming schools. That's why Labour will 
introduce new and robust local oversight of all schools to raise 
standards. That’s what new Directors of School Standards will bring.'

Mr
 Blunkett told the Mail his proposals were aimed at ending the ‘current 
ridiculous situation where the Secretary of State is gradually 
contractually overseeing thousands of schools’.

Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt is understood to have accepted the ideas

‘Putting
 the glue back into the system means overturning the fractured and 
“atomised” landscape, as Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools
 has put it,’ he said.

But 
he said there would be ‘no going backwards under my recommendations’ and
 no return to the days of local authorities running all schools.

‘Instead,
 we would want to build on what’s already there, ensure there is 
absolutely transparency, fairness and, above all, that everyone knows 
who is responsible for school improvement - world class head teachers 
and the highest quality classroom teachers, supported by the new local 
Director of School Standards.’

The
 directors would also work with local authorities to plan new schools 
and provide extra places, with an expectation they would allow popular 
schools to expand if they wished to.

They would oversee competitions between providers to open new schools where needed.

Mr Blunkett was asked by Labour leader Ed Miliband to oversee education policy development.

The proposed reforms draw on the London Challenge initiative which has been credited with transforming standards in London schools.

The scheme used measures such as heads collaborating to raise standards and changes of leadership where required.

There was also a concerted attempt to break the link between poverty and poor results with ‘zero tolerance’ of low expectations.

The independent directors would be a statutory appointment made from a shortlist of candidates. Councils would join together to appoint a shared DSS across a local area or sub-region.

Mr Blunkett says memory tests - something Mr Gove has pushed strenuously - are 'important' but warns the education system must offer 'much more than this'.

He adds: 'Schools and colleges are not factories to instil facts, and then hope that young people somehow make sense of them and become function and creative adults.

'We have to provide the opportunity to build those think or critical skills, which allow the analytical faculties to develop - to be able to challenge, as well as to make sense of the ever-changing world around us.'

The report recommends the creation of temporary 'education incubation zones' where the latest teaching methods and technology would be used to help raise standards and the introduction of a duty on government to represent the interests of pupils and parents.

It underlines Labour's existing calls for teachers to be properly qualified and an end to the ability of some schools to opt out of local admissions codes.

Mr Blunkett said the emphasis of Labour's policy was 'entirely on delivering inspiration teaching and aspirational learning'.
