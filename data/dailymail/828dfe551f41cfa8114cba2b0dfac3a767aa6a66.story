Footballer Carlos Tevez has avoided completing a  250-hour community service order by paying a £3,000 fine – the equivalent of half an hour of his wages.

The multi-millionaire’s  lawyers argued that he could not complete the work after transferring from Premier League club Manchester City to Juventus in Italy.

Tevez had completed just 28 hours of his punishment – imposed after being convicted of a string of driving offences earlier this year.

Avoided: Former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez has had his community service rescinded in favour of a £3,000 fine - a sum he earns in just 37 minutes on his £196,000 a week salary

Yesterday a district judge sitting at Macclesfield magistrates’ court fined Tevez a derisory £3,000 – in place of finishing his punishment.

The fine is a drop in the ocean for the Argentinian striker, who reportedly earned £250,000 a week at Manchester City. Based on a 40-hour week, he collected £6,250 an hour – meaning the fine is the equivalent of just 30 minutes’ ‘work’.

Last night criminologist Dr David Green said: ‘The punishment he is receiving is certainly not proportionate to his crimes.

‘And this certainly does not send the right message as the fine is just a tiny fraction of what he earns.

‘This judge has simply failed in her duty to the justice system.’ A spokesman for Families Against Crime added: ‘Let’s not beat about the bush, Carlos Tevez was guilty of repeated driving offences and rode roughshod over the  British justice system.

Into Italy: The Argentinian signed for Juventus two weeks ago. His career at Manchester City was tempestuous

‘By flouting a driving ban and then essentially escaping justice with a measly fine the courts have shown themselves to be complete pushovers.

‘The level of the fine is a disgrace  and sends out completely the wrong message to other drivers.

‘Maybe the next offender will seek to have his community order lifted and offer a fraction of his weekly wage. What a shambles.’

Tevez, 29, was not in court. His lawyers were told he would face the £5,000 maximum fine for his offence – but with a £2,000 ‘reduction’ for his guilty plea and the 28 hours’ work he completed.

Tevez leaving Macclesfield Magistrates Court in April after he was ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service

Tevez was disqualified from driving for six months and handed community service in April after he admitted driving while disqualified and without insurance. The court heard he had completed 28 hours of the order at Macclesfield’s Community Garden Centre, where he helped adults with learning difficulties.

Gwyn Lewis, defending, said the order became unworkable when the player was sold to a foreign club, adding: ‘Events overtook  his control and he was sold  to Juventus.’

A community service order involves unpaid work in the community or attendance at a centre to undertake a course, such as anger management. Breaches can see the orders being revoked and more severe penalties imposed. Yesterday Judge Bridget Knight accepted the circumstances were beyond Tevez’s control, adding: ‘This is only a technical breach. It is not, I repeat not, a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order.’

It is thought Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order.

In a statement, Tevez said: ‘I would like to thank the court for its understanding.’
