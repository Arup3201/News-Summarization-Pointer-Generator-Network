An Australian body recovered from the Malaysia Airlines MH17 wreckage site had an oxygen mask wrapped around his neck, a Dutch prosecutor has claimed.

Wim de Bruin, a spokesman  for the Dutch agency investigating  the incident, has informed the passenger's relatives that a mask was discovered around his neck  but officials are yet to release the Australian's name.

He said it was not clear from forensic testing when the mask was applied to the man's face, but its discovery has raised questions that he was conscious after the plane was hit by a missile on July 17 over east Ukraine near the Russian border.

Mr De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask 'for fingerprints, saliva and DNA,' but it did not produce any results, Associated Press reported.

It comes as Holland's Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans apologised to the families of MH17 victims for revealing that a passenger was wearing a mask on live TV.

It resulted in a flood of phone calls to investigators from the relatives of the 298 passengers and crew who perished, including 38 Australians, seeking more information about the passenger.

Mr Timmermans had asked talk-show host Jeroen Pauw whether he was aware that a passenger was wearing a mask on the flight when he said: 'Did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth?'

But he apologised  on Thursday, saying: 'I have an enormous amount of sympathy for the next-of-kin,' he said. 'The last thing I want to do is compound their suffering in this way,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 

The Dutch Foreign Minister received international acclaim for a speech he made days after the incident.

He suggested that the discovery of the oxygen mask-wearing passenger revealed that at least one person was conscious when the plane was hit by a missile fired by Russian-backed rebels.

He also added during the interview that it was unlikely that any of the 298 passengers and crew on board saw the missile approaching.

'No, they did not see the missile coming, but did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth? So someone had the time to to do that,' he said. 

There was no evidence to conclude that the final moments could not have been as described in his speech at the UN - when he played through scenarios of passengers on the plane.

'I've been thinking how horrible the final moments of their lives must have been, when they knew the plane was going down,' Mr Timmermans told the UN.

'Did they lock hands with their loved ones, did they hold their children close to their hearts, did they look each other in the eyes, one final time, in a wordless goodbye? We will never know.' 

Experts investigating the crash said everyone on board was most likely killed immediately or, if not, became unconscious within seconds.

A preliminary report published by the Dutch Safety Board revealed puncture holes in the wreckage suggested small objects penetrated the plane through the cockpit.

It was also revealed that holes were found on the cockpit floor and damage to the body was consistent with 'high-energy objects' piercing it from the outside.

Forensic experts have so far been unable to recover all bodies from the crash site.

About  228 coffins have been flown back to the Netherlands for identification, but some of the coffins contained only partial remains.

It is unknown how many bodies remain unaccounted for and only 262 victims have been identified so far.
