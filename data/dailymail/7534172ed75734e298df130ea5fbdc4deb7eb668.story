Two different sets of storm chasing meteorologists had lucky escapes on Friday night after their vehicles got too close to the multiple tornados that hit the Oklahoma City area.

Mike Bettes, a member of the Weather Channel Tornado Hunt Team, was driving in his SUV when it was picked up and thrown 200 yards by the monster rain-wrapped tornado near El Reno, Oklahoma.

In a separate incident, Brandon Sullivan and Brett Wright 
captured heart stopping footage of their exploits getting too close to the 
powerful twister near Union City, in southwest Oklahoma City.

Bettes was nursing minor injuries Saturday, including stitches in his hand, a day after the SUV that he and two photographers were riding in was thrown 200 yards by a twister in Oklahoma.

The Weather Channel said all the occupants were wearing safety belts and walked away from the banged-up vehicle.

It's the first time one of the network's personalities has been injured while covering violent weather, spokeswoman Shirley Powell said.

'That was the scariest moment of my life,' Bettes said. 'I had never been through anything like it before, and my life passed before my eyes.'

He and the photographers were trying to outrun a tornado they spotted in El Reno, Okla., and failed.

Bettes said it felt like the vehicle tumbled over several times and was floating in the air before crashing to the ground.

Meanwhile Sullivan and Wright were able to capture dramatic video showing them tracking the multiple tornadoes that hit the Oklahoma City area on Friday night.

In
the intense clip, the pair are seen frantically trying to drive to 
safety as the tornado approaches and while they manage to escape by the 
skin of their teeth, their vehicle suffers serious damage from debris 
that flies straight into their windshield.

The clip, uploaded to their website StormChasingVideo, lasts almost five minutes and includes multiple camera angles of the approaching storm.

In the video, Brandon does most of the talking as he signals to his partner how to move away from the path of the storm.

He marvels at the power of the storm, staring ahead into two twisters heading their way. 

'Man, twin tornadoes.Continuous vortices,' he comments.

Though he is awe in the power of mother nature, his reaction soon turns to sheer terror.

'Brett turn the car around!' he yells as the storm approaches.

'Brett go! As fast as you can,' he added.

'Brett if you don't go south we're gonna die.'

Tornadoes rolled in from the prairie and slammed Oklahoma City and its suburbs, trapping people in their vehicles as a storm swept down an interstate highway while commuters tried to beat it home.

Five people were killed, including a mother and baby killed near Union City.

Another person died at El Reno, the first city struck by the storm, said Amy Elliott, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner. Circumstances involving the other two deaths weren't immediately known, Elliott said.

About 50 people were hurt, five critically, hospital officials said.

Meteorologists had warned about particularly nasty weather Friday but said the storm's fury didn't match that of a deadly twister that struck suburban Moore last week. Violent weather also moved through the St. Louis area, ripping part of the roof off a suburban casino.

Friday's broad storm in Oklahoma hit during the evening rush hour and stuck around, causing havoc on Interstate 40, a major artery connecting suburbs east and west of the city, and dropping so much rain on the area that streets were flooded to a depth of 4 feet.
