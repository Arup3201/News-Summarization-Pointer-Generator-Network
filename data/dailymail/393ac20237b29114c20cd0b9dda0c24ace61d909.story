Theresa May has asked for officials to carry out an 'urgent' review over whether the law on 'sexting' minors, which campaigners say leaves young people vulnerable to grooming, should be tightened

Sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal, Theresa May said today.

The Home Secretary  has asked officials to carry out an 'urgent' review on whether the law needs to be tightened.

At present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under-16s, except when it contains graphic images, or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act.

Campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim.

Labour MP Heidi Alexander said that currently a child would have to be coerced into sending a sexual picture of themselves or actually meeting a sex offender before the police could take action.

Speaking in the Commons, Mrs May said officials had been asked to consider the case for changing the law as an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill currently before Parliament.

She told MPs: 'We do need to be able to intervene early so predatory behaviour is tackled before a child is put at risk.'

The NSPCC has warned of an increase in children being sent explicit messages by adults.

The charity's head of child safety online, Claire Lilley, said: 'No adult should be deliberately sending sexual messages to children, but incredibly it is not always illegal.

'Existing laws are a hotch-potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes.

'The rise of online communication means that children are increasingly being exposed to sexual messages from adults, on social networks or through messaging apps, but in many cases the police are powerless to act.'

'Currently, old laws are being stretched to fit new sex offender behaviour.'

Campaigners say the existing laws 'are a hotch-potch and sex offenders can and do exploit the loopholes'

A recent YouGov poll found four-in-five adults support a change in the law.

Under section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it is an offence for someone over the age of 18 to communicate with someone under the age of 16 on at least two separate occasions and to then meet them or to travel to meet them with the intention to commit a sexual act.

The maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment.
