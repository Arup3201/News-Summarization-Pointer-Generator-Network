As budget airlines get more and more stingy, charging for everything from printing boarding passes to on-board snacks, plenty of 'whatever next?' quips have been made.

Previously joked about but scarcely believed travel horrors such as standing-only flights and extra fees for obese passengers may soon become a reality though, according to reports.

While flying first class is only getting more luxurious with on-board showers, nannies for children and private suites, the whole plane experience is gradually becoming a lot worse for those who can't afford to fly luxe class.

The future is not bright: Airlines will be going to even more extreme lengths to cut costs 

Airlines will be going to even more extreme lengths to cut costs and cram in more passengers on every flight, according to a report compiled by Breadwise.

Standing cabins 

Among some of the more bizarre and worrying innovations in travellers' future are the vertical passenger seats.

The idea of the 'standing cabin' made headlines in 2010 when Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary suggested that the airline would be introducing it, but spokespeople for the airline have since rejected the idea,

Nevertheless, the 'Skyrider' seat has been created by AvioInteriors, and aerospace engineering professor at the Universiti Putra Malaysia Fairuz Romli predicts that the 'standing cabin' will be in planes within five years.

'I'm a frequent flier and most of the times during domestic flights, it feels like the flying time is very short that the aircraft is already descending for landing before you can unfasten your seatbelt after takeoff,' he told CNN.

'Hence the big question came to my mind: in such a short duration of flight time, do we really need to sit down?'

Romli's research predicts that standing cabins could increase passenger capacity by 21 per cent, and cut the cost of a ticket by up to 44 per cent.

The 'fat tax' 

With soaring fuel costs, every kilogram counts. While some airlines insist on overweight passengers purchasing an extra seat, a new pricing structure could see those over a certain weight threshold facing a surcharge.

A Norwegian economics scholar, Dr. Bharat P. Bhatta, published a paper outlining three possible ways of charging passengers for excess weight, including a per-kilo fee and charge for total weight of the passenger and their luggage combined.

No life jackets - hang on to your seat cushion instead! 

By the same token, Air Canada's regional airline Jazz removed all life jackets from its aircraft in 2008, saving 25 kilograms per flight.

The airline was allowed to do this as regulations state that flotation devices rather than safety jackets may be used if the plane stays within 50 miles of shore.

Passengers are now instructed to hold on to their seat cushions in case of an emergency. Will other domestic airlines offload their life jackets too?

All-female flight crew  

In yet another bizarre fuel and therefore money-saving measure, at least one airline has proposed hiring only female crew, who are on average 15-20 kilograms lighter than male flight attendants.

Indian budget airline GoAir last year announced plans to hire 2,000 new crew members over the next seven years as its expands - all female. Current male employees will be unaffected.

And they're not stopping there. 'We are reducing the weight on board our aircraft. The size of in-flight magazines has been reduced. The potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35% to 40% of that water is actually used. Now the water tanks are filled 60%, GoAir CEO Giorgio De Roni told The Times of India. 

With huge savings predicted, it may not be long before other airlines follow suit.

Pay to pee 

Like many public restrooms, coughing up to use the WC on board may soon be a reality. Serial offender of the stingiest airlines, Ryanair, is just one to announce plans to introduce coin-operated toilets.

The idea is to encourage passengers to use the bathroom before their flight,so that airlines can remove at least toilets from each plane and replace them with extra seats.

DIY everything 

First passengers were checking themselves in, now some airlines require them to print their baggage tags as well. Before long, travellers will be scanning fingerprints to board the plane and grabbing food and drink on board themselves, according to forecasters.

Last year, British Airways began trials of a reusable digital bag tag  that syncs with the BA smartphone app.

Each time the passenger flies, the electronic barcode on the bag tag updates to a new unique code.

In 2008, Air New Zealand introduced total self check-in on domestic flights, which saw passengers check in, tag and deposit their luggage on a conveyor belt to be processed behind the scenes.  'It’s very unusual for us to see any queues forming anywhere at the airport,' Air New Zealand CEO Rob Fyfe said at the time. 'For the passenger, it means less hassle, a shorter journey and an improved experience, and for us it means a competitive advantage.'

Chat at 30,000 feet: The FCC may be reversing its ban on in-flight cellular communications

In-flight phone calls 

Most passengers have welcomed airlines softening stance on the use of electronic devices during takeoff and landing. And the introduction of wifi on board. But do they really want to listen to their seat neighbour chatting away at 30,000 feet on a long-haul flight, with nowhere to run?

In January the Federal Communication Commission proposed a reversal of its 1991 ruling that cellular communications on aircraft be banned. The use of phones in-flight is no longer unsafe because of changes in mobile technology, according to InformationWeek.
