Darren Wright, a fugitive who boasted on Facebook that police were looking for him 'in the wrong places.' He was found by police and is now back behind bars

A fugitive who taunted police on Facebook by posting ‘you ain’t gonna get me’ is back behind bars after officers took up his challenge and tracked him down.

Darren Wright, 26, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was jailed in August 2011 for three years and nine months for vehicle crime  - but was released early in June 2013.

In January he breached the terms of his early release from prison, prompting a police man hunt.

After hearing of officer's attempts to track him down, the man posted on the social media site - boasting police were 'looking in the wrong places'.

Greater Manchester Polive today confirmed they found Wright hiding at a Salford address on April 2 - and he is now back behind bars.

The force took to Twitter to boast about their success, finishing their post with:  '#dontchallengeuswewillwin'

After his disappearance in January, police executed a series of search warrants on addresses where they thought Wright was hiding - but could not find the fugitive.

Wright then took to Facebook to taunt officers - writing arrogant posts on both his own wall and the force's official page.

The man wrote that sending 10-man Tactical Aid Unit (TAU) teams to look for him was a waste of time and suggested they use ‘fast wips’ - slang forspeedy patrol cars - if they wanted to ‘get anywhere near me’.

He wrote: 'All you police goin to all these gafs (homes) 10man up in tau vans dont bother coz u aint gona get me ur lookin in the wrong areas.

'Lookin all over my facebook and then raidin gafs lol i know ur gona be reading this so good luck your gona need it and your gona to be getin your fast wips out if your gona try and even get anywhere near me.'

The message prompted police to renew their efforts to track him down. Officers finally found the man hiding at an address in Salford during a raid on April 2.

Wright was jailed for three years and 9 months - but was released early in June 2013. He breached his terms of early release in January, prompting a police hunt

Greater Manchester Police then took to Twitter to announce Wright had finally been captured

Wright was sent back prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.

Following his capture, an officer from the force tweeted: 'A 26-year-old male wanted for recall to prison wrote on GMP’s Facebook page saying he knows he is wanted and the challenge is to catch him.

'We rose to the challenge, did a few inquiries, arrested a short time later & sent straight to prison on remand! #dontchallengeuswewillwin.”
