Barack Obama honoured the six teachers who died shielding children during the Sandy Hook massacre as he named the National Teacher of the Year for 2013.

The winner is Jeff Charbonneau of Zillah High School in Washington state's Yakima Valley, who is credited with improving science enrolment among students.

As well as instructing students in chemistry, physics, engineering and architecture, he runs a state-wide robotics competition, serves as yearbook adviser and started an outdoors club.

National Teacher of the Year 2013 Jeff Charbonneau takes centre stage for pictures with the President Barack Obama at the end of the ceremony: As 
he stood with the finalists, Obama joked that if any have problems 
with their students, 'tell them the President said ...,' prompting 
laughter from those present

At a ceremony in the White House Rose 
Garden, the President said the best teachers encourage children's 
passions and inspire their imaginations.

'These
teachers, they are the ones we entrust with our kids, they are the 
people who love our kids,' he said.Teachers didn't go into this line of 
work for light hours and easy work, Obama said, but because of their 
passion for helping children.

He
thank finalists at yesterday's special event for not only instructing a
given subject, but also teaching students character, compassion, 
resilience and imagination.

'They're
filling young minds with virtues and values,' he said. 'They're 
teaching our kids to cooperate and overcome obstacles.'

Honour: Obama hands the National 
Teacher of the Year award to Mr Charbonneau, who teaches at Zillah 
High School in Zillah, Washington. As well as instructing students in

club

Obama shakes hands with Mr Charbonneau, and congratulates him with an affectionate hug: The President thank finalists at yesterday's special 
event for not only instructing a given subject, but also teaching 
students character, compassion, resilience and imagination in a job that required long hours and hard work

Obama also made a poignant special 
mention of the six educators who killed last December in Newtown, 
Connecticut, during a shooting spree by a lone gunman who also claimed 
the lives of 20 pupils of Sandy Hook Elementary School.

'We
saw the true depths of a teacher’s commitment when six educators were 
killed trying to protect the children they embraced as their own,' he 
said.

'There was the teacher who locked her 
first-grade students in a bathroom and whispered, “I love you," because,
in her words, “I wanted that to be the last thing they heard, and not 
gunfire.” 

'[There was] the special-education 
teacher who was found cradling a student in her arms, trying to protect 
him from the evil that ultimately took them both.

'In
those moments, those brave teachers showed the world what they do is 
more than just educate kids.  They embrace them and they nurture them 
and they love them. 

'And we know that the men and women behind me do the same.'

Poignant: Obama also made special mention of the
six educators who killed last December in Newtown, Connecticut, during a
shooting spree by lone teenage gunman Adam Lanza which also claimed the lives of 20 pupils
of Sandy Hook Elementary School, as well as killing his own mother

'True depths of a teacher's commitment': 
Remembering the victims of the massacre, the President said that 
teachers do more than just educate children

Mr Charbonneau, who began his teaching
career in 2001 at Zillah, his alma mater, started a program to help 
students get college credit for the classes they take at the high 
school.

The inspirational educator said he greets his students every day with, 'Welcome back to another day in paradise.'

The
work brings its own reward, he said, adding: 'You see the wrinkles. 
Wrinkles are the born witness to the hours of laughter and the moments 
of joy that come from sharing the art of discovery with our students.'

President Barack Obama talks with the Teacher of
the Year finalists: The president said he has a 'soft spot' for 
teachers since his sister is and mother was an educator. While maths and
science teachers are often lauded, he also recognised English, art, 
music and history teachers for inspiring children to pursue their 
passion

his award as the President and Secretary of Education watch. He began

The president said he has a 'soft spot' for teachers since his sister is and mother was an educator. While maths and science teachers are

teachers for inspiring children to pursue their passion.

'Educators
like Jeff and everyone up here today, they represent the very best of 
America - committed professionals who give themselves fully to the 
growth and development of our kids,' said Obama.

'And
with them at the front of the classroom and leading our schools, I am 
absolutely confident that our children are going to be prepared to meet 
the tests of our time and the tests of the future.'

As Obama took pictures with the finalists, he joked that if any have problems with their students, 'tell them the president said ...,' and the teachers laughed.
