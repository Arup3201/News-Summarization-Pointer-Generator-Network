A man known as ‘The Bonfire King’ who organised Britain’s biggest Guy Fawkes Night party for 50 years has been given an explosive send-off after his ashes were shot into the sky.

Keith Austin spent half a century as the driving force behind the massive Bonfire night celebrations in Lewes, Sussex, which draws tens of thousands of spectators every year.

The local councillor and charity fundraiser, who was secretary of his local bonfire society for many years, died in September aged 75.

He was given a fitting send-off on Tuesday night when his ashes were strapped to rockets and blasted into the air as part of the fireworks show.

Tribute: Keith Austin was known as 'The Bonfire King' because of his pivotal role in organising the Lewes Guy Fawkes Night celebration which is believed to be the biggest in the world

Officials say an estimated 30,000 people were there when Mr Austin - known locally as ‘Mr Bonfire’ and ‘The Bonfire King’ - was shot into the sky and exploded in colour.

Duncan Roy, of the Cliffe Bonfire Society, said: 'This really was an extraordinary tribute to someone who touched all our lives.

'We sent him up in the first and last rocket of the night, as a way to say goodbye to a dear friend.'

Tim Knight, president of bonfire society, said: 'He was a fervent bonfire person. It would have tickled him pink.'

Lewes MP Norman Baker said: 'I was in contact with Keith over many years about bonfire matters.

'I admired his straight-talking, his determination and his integrity, and generally had a lot of time for him. He is a loss to the town and to the bonfire in particular.'

Best friend Nick Quinn added: 'He will be up there having a good giggle.'

The Lewes Bonfire Night Celebrations is said to be the biggest November 5th event in the world and includes a costume parade.

Every year it commemorates the Gunpowder Plot but also pays tribute to 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town during 16th Century.

Bachelor Mr Austin, who worked for a taxi company, started help run the event 50 years ago and served as secretary of the Cliffe Bonfire Society for several years.

Keith died in September and his coffin was paraded through the streets so hundreds of local people could pay their respects.

During the event on Tuesday his ashes were distributed to each of six bonfires in the town - who sent him up in rockets.
