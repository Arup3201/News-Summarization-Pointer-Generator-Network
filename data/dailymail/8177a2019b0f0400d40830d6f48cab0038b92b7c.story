One man's trash is another man's treasure, as this artist proves by building mini-mobile homes for the homeless - from recycled rubbish.

Greg Kloehn uses garbage like bed frames, pallets, car consoles and even washing machine doors to build his creative constructions.

The 43-year-old artist only has to buy nails, screws and glue for the colourful constructions as the rest are collected on scavenger hunts for illegally dumped rubbish.

Once they are completed, Mr Kloehn gives them away for free to the homeless people near his home in Oakland, California.

The father-of-two used his first dumpster house as a second-home, until he had a eureka moment.

Mr Kloehn said: 'After about a week of collecting and building, I had a 21st century home, built from the discarded fruits of the urban jungle.

'This sat at my studio for a number of months, just collecting dust until one rainy night,
Charlene, a homeless woman I've known for some 10 years, asked if I had a tarpaulin for her.
'I told her I didn't but as I went inside and walked past the home, it hit me, I should give her the house.

'So I ran back out and told her to come back tomorrow and I would have a home for her. The next day, she and her husband Oscar came round, I handed them the keys and a bottle of champagne and watched them push it down the street.

'It felt so good that I started making another one that same day.'

Greg first started the project three years ago after being inspired by the materials homeless people use.

'His initial dumpster house included a camp stove for cooking, a toilet that can be hooked up to a septic tank and even a shower with hot water.
To date he has made and given away 10 of the houses and admits he now loves the reaction they get.'

He said: 'The people who get them are 
so happy!
'One cried and got on his knees to thank me. I think it is extremely 
important to help these people out as they keep getting moved by the 
city and need to relocate every few weeks.

'This way, as the dumpsters are on wheels, they can be pushed around really easily.'

Although
 Mr Kloehn pours his heart into making them, as soon as he gifts a house
 away, its future is in the hands of the new owner.
Sadly some have been stolen, burned or even sold but most of the 
recipients are still living in them.

Mr Kloehn believes his recycled homes could solve present and future housing problems, as they are environmentally friendly and relatively cheap

housing problems, as they are environmentally friendly and relatively 
cheap.

Mr Kloehn said: 'Tiny
 houses strike a number of cords in our society as they aren't just 
homes, but fast becoming a life style option. They are, usually, cheaper
 than regular homes, giving more people the opportunity of ownership.

'Small
 spaces means it's easier to power an entire house with the sun or wind,
 and water can be collected and used over and again with simple catch 
and filtration systems. Even black waste can be turned into methane 
and/or composite for food production.

'I
 think their mobility is one of the most revolutionary aspects of the 
tiny home movement as your customized home could follow you wherever you
 needed to be.

'If you built a home that followed you throughout your life, I bet you would be a bit more thoughtful in your choices.'

So, in the future, we could all be living in dumpsters like Oscar the Grouch.'
