Miami-Dade Police believe they have their man, the one who violently killed an 18-year-old girl and coldly dumped her lifeless body in an empty lot.

Fernando Granados, 20, of Homestead FL., confessed Thursday to the killing of Tiffany Cabreja. Mr Granados reportedly told investigators another man helped him kill the girl, he has yet to be apprehended.

Mr Granados was snagged by police after he confessed to a relative he killed the girl.

Confessed killer: Fernando Granados. Granados confessed to strangling 18-year-old Tiffany Cabreja and dumping her body at a construction site

The trio smoked crack-cocaine together at a local park before the two men strangled and beat her to death before leaving her lifeless body behind at a construction site, according to an affidavit cited by local media.

‘The victim was with this suspect, and another male, left her home with these two individuals, went to a nearby park, it’s my understanding they smoked crack at the park,’ Detective Roy Rutland, of Miami-Dade Police, told CBS Miami.

Ms Cabreja was found earlier this week with a bag over her head, secured tightly with a cord, and covered in bruises, the affidavit said. Her cause of death was determined to be strangulation and blunt force trauma.

Mr Cabrejas almost immediately came clean with investigators after he was brought in for questioning.

Saying he was high on crack-cocaine at the time, Mr Cabrejas told officials he attacked the young girl and put her in a choke hold while the other man ‘“simultaneously struck her from the front,’ the affidavit said.

‘Mr. Granados advised that he was under the influence of crack cocaine at the time he attacked the victim and was unaware if he killed her,’ said the affidavit.

‘It appears because they were sharing crack together, these two individuals lost control and murdered [Ms Cabreja],’ Mr Rutland told NBC Miami.

Conflicting reports have Ms Cabreja’s father telling local media that she either knew Mr Granados from school or did not know him at all. The relationship between the trio is unclear at this time.

The murdered teen’s heartbroken mother is still struggling to cope with the loss of her daughter.‘I have not slept for four days. I have not eaten. I can’t imagine what is going on. I feel a lot of pain inside,’ Miriam Vasquez told CBS Miami.

‘What they did to her was just horrible,’ Ms Vasquez added. ‘I saw her body and it was horrible what they did to her.’

Investigators initially focused their attention on a truck in the area where Ms Cabrejas body was discovered after multiple witnesses claimed to have seen a body fall out before being stuffed back in.

That truck driver repeatedly proclaimed his innocence during interrogation and to any media outlet that would listen.

His girlfriend told multiple local media outlets she was the one who fell out of the truck, not Ms Cabreja, and that it happened while the two were fighting.

Officials are still searching for the second suspect.
