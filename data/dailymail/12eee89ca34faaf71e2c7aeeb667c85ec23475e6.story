As another controversy threatened for winless Pakistan in New Zealand, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan told reporters: 'Moin admitted he went to a casino in Christchurch but said he had gone there with friends to have dinner.

'We have told him he should return home until we further probe the matter.

'Manager Naved Cheema will now chair the tour selection committee with captain Misbah-ul-Haq and head coach Waqar Younis.'
