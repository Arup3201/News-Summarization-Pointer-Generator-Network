Four-time major winner Ernie Els admits time is against him, but has not given up hope of a 'Cinderella' victory in the Masters in April.

Els finished second at Augusta in 2000 and 2004 - and was sixth, fifth and sixth in the years in between - but has yet to claim a green jacket to go with his two Open and US Open victories.

The 45-year-old missed the cut in the Masters last year and failed to record a tournament victory on either the European Tour or PGA Tour all season, dropping from 27th in the world to 63rd as a result.

However, the former world number one insists he is as motivated as ever as he seeks a sixth victory in the South African Open at Glendower in his native Johannesburg this week.

'I've played a lot of golf at Glendower, social rounds, tournament rounds, so there's a lot of history here for me and it's wonderful to be back,' said Els, who is also the tournament host and ambassador.

'I've always taken the South African Open as like a fifth major for me, so to be involved in a capacity where I can host and be an ambassador, thus giving something back to the tournament, is just a phenomenal gift that was given to me.

'I'm getting on now. I've got this title as host ambassador, so you'll see me here for a long time at the SA Open, maybe not as a player later on, but doing what I can.

'It's a different dimension that I'm going into, but as a player right now I feel very motivated to win as many as I can before I'm done, so to speak - especially playing at this course that I know so well and coming back to my roots.

'I still have the drive and want to achieve something. If I can be greedy I would go with Augusta for a win - that would be a Cinderella story.'

Local players have an excellent record in European Tour events on home soil, with five of the eight staged last season being won by South Africans.

Six events will be held in South Africa this season with England's Danny Willett winning the Nedbank Golf Challenge and South African Branden Grace tasting victory in the Alfred Dunhill Championship in December, while Denmark's Morten Orum Madsen defends his South African Open title this week.

'It's really special to be back and try to defend a title for the first time in my career, so obviously when I stepped in the gate and on to the course it brought back a lot of good memories,' said Madsen, who managed just one other top-10 finish last season.

'Walking into the locker room I remember some really good times in there right after the round, and when all the interviews were over and done with, it was just me, my caddie and my dad in there reflecting on what had just happened.

'It's been extremely exciting and fun to play as a winner on the European Tour. It's definitely drawn extra attention, and also some different feelings from within as to how the game should be played.

'I haven't really performed the way I would have liked to, but I think on some subconscious level I put too much pressure on myself to play well. My expectations sort of rose a little bit more than they probably should have, but I wouldn't have changed a thing.

'This past year has been a good learning experience that I can use for years to come. I feel like I'm a more experienced player now, and I'm probably better suited now to play well and have some success on the European Tour. When I tee it up tomorrow I'll be gunning for the best score I can shoot, but I don't really have expectations.'
