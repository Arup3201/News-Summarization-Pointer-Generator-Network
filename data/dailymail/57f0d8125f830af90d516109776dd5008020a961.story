Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Southampton won this Premier League fixture 2-0 last season courtesy of two own goals (Alcaraz and Coleman).

That defeat ended a run of eight games unbeaten for Everton against Southampton in the Premier League (W4 D4).

Southampton have won two and lost none of the last five Premier League games against Everton at St Mary’s.

If games ended at half-time this season, Everton would be third in the Premier League table with 28 points.

However, if only the second-half of matches counted, Everton would be 14th with 17 points.

Dusan Tadic has not scored or assisted a single goal in his last eight PL appearances; this after having a hand in seven goals in his first eight PL apps (six assists, one goal).

Nevertheless, Tadic has created the most goalscoring opportunities from open play than any other player in the Premier League this season (42).

Steven Naismith has scored five goals from just eight shots on target in the Premier League this season.

Ronald Koeman has made just 38 of the 48 substitutions available to him in the Premier League this season; no club has used as few.

Southampton have seen six players start every single Premier League game this season; more than any other side.
