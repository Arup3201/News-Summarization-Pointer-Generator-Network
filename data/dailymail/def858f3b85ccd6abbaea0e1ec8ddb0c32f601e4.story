Hugging a giant block of ice may seem a bizarre way to bring good fortune to your new year, but at least these men from Japan can console themselves with the thought that it can't get much worse.

In in Tokyo yesterday around 100 people took part in the ancient Shinto festival of Kanchu Misogi, a winter purification ritual that is supposed to cleanse the body and soul and bring them closer to mystical spirits which they believe can bring them success.

In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the freezing water of the pool at Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine while crouching down in order to pray.

Ice to meet to: Despite holding a giant block of ice in a freeing cold pool, this Shinto worshipper manages to crack a smile for the cameras

In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men climbed into a pool of freezing water at the Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine in central Tokyo in order to pray

The ritual is supposed to purify the followers in order to bring them closer to kame - spirits or powers - which they believe will bring them good fortune

Happy New Year: Kanchu Misogi is a traditional new year festival in Japan for followers of Shinto which is supposed to purify body and soul and bring good fortune

The ritual is celebrated across Japan and usually involved participants washing themselves with cold water, but can also involve being covered in snow.

Shinto is less of a religion and more of a way of life, and followers perform many rituals designed to please kame - meaning spirits or powers. This particular shrine is dedicated to Inari, one of the most important kame who brings success, prosperity and fertility.

Despite their obvious suffering in these pictures, followers of Shinto believe that the spirits want humans to be happy and are willing to help them if they are treated correctly.Â 

Around 100 followers took part in the ceremony which is celebrated all over Japan, but usually just involves washing in cold water

The temple seen here is dedicated to Inari, one of the main kame of Shinto, who can bring people prosperity, success and fertility

Shinto is more of a way of life, rather than a religion, as it has no commandments, no God, no founder and allows people to follow other beliefs

Desite this man's suffering, Shiinto teaches that humans are essentially good and that the spirits that watch over them love them and want them to succeed

Shinto has no God or Gods, no founder, no central commandments and allows people to follow other religions. Instead it teaches ethical principles and a love of oneself.

Shinto, which translates as 'way of the spirits', is intricately linked with the geography of Japan, and so is rarely practiced outside of the country.

Purity is at the heart of Shinto's understanding of good and evil. Pollution - tsumi - can be physical, moral or spiritual.

Being pure is incredibly important to believers of Shinto, though their equivalent of sin - tsumi - is usually caused by things outside of people's control, rather than people themselves

Shinto means 'way of the spirits' and is seldom worshipped outside of Japan because of its very strong link with the Japanese landscape

Other purity rituals in Shinto can involve going long periods without sleep, breathing exercises, standing under waterfalls and other balance training

The ritual also helps to keep the participants physically fit and tests their endurance

Tsumi means much the same as the English word 'sin', but it differs from sin in that it includes things which are beyond the control of individual human beings and are thought of as being caused by evil spirits.

In ancient Shinto, tsumi also included disease, disaster and error. Anything connected with death or the dead is considered particularly polluting.
