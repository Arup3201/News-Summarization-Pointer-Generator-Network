Italian officials are seeking a staggering £177m (€220m) in damages from a cruise line company after two popular tourist regions suffered a major blow following the Costa Concordia disaster.

Tuscany's government wants £25m (€30m) in compensation from Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp., arguing that its image has been tarnished and tourism has declined significantly.

And a separate claim by the island of Giglio, where the 950-ft-long cruiser ran aground in January 2012, has been put in for £152m (€190m).

The government of Tuscany says its image has been tarnished and tourism suffered

The Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio and capsized, killing 32 people. 

The ship remained partially submerged near the port of the holiday island for more than two years before being raised and towed away this year in one of the largest and most complex maritime salvages ever completed.

According to a statement, Tuscany's president, Enrico Rossi, announced that the region was filing a compensation claim, telling a court in the city of Grosseto: 'We will ask Costa for €30m in damages to Tuscany's image.'

Mr Rossi said the region had registered a decline in tourism, and that Giglio alone had lost 45,000 visitors due to the disaster.

A consultant to Giglio's local government, Carlo Scarpa, asked the same court for £152m (€190m) in damages, according to a source present during the proceedings.

The two officials spoke during an ongoing trial against Costa Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino, who is being tried for multiple charges, including manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.

Mr Rossi told court: 'To reconstruct the image of Tuscany as a top tourist destination will require years of work, substantial investments and costly national and international advertising campaigns.'

Costa Cruises last year avoided a criminal trial by agreeing to pay a €1m fine to the Italian state, but victims and local administrations have pursued damages separately.

Shortly after the shipwreck, Costa Cruises also agreed to pay about €11,000 to each of the passengers for items lost and any psychological damages to those who suffered no physical injuries.
