Republican U.S. Sen. 
Thad Cochran of Mississippi said Friday that it's 'unfortunate' and 'sort of bizarre' that somebody photographed his ailing wife in a 
nursing home and posted her image online in a political video against 
him.

A conservative blogger and three others 
have been arrested in the past week and charged with at least one felony
 each in what Madison police call a conspiracy to take unauthorized 
photos of 72-year-old Rose Cochran, who has dementia.

Cochran spoke to a small group of reporters Friday outside a campaign event in Jackson, according to WAPT-TV

Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28,  is accused of taking a picture of Rose Cochran in her nursing home

Tea Party member Mark Mayfield and John Mary were allegedly planning to use the image of Rose Cochran in a ad claiming her senator husband was having an affair

School teacher Richard Sager was also arrested for his part in the plot

'It's
 an unfortunate, sort of bizarre incident, but it's being handled by the
 authorities and I trust in their good judgment,' said Cochran, who has 
been in Washington most of the week.

He also 
said: 'The nursing home people are worried, you know, about the impact 
it might have on their reputation. But I think everybody is trying to do
 the right thing.'

The photo incident has 
created turmoil during the final two weeks of a campaign in which a tea 
party-backed candidate, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, is trying to defeat a
 former Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who's been in 
Washington more than 40 years.

The primary is June 3.

McDaniel
 has said repeatedly that his campaign had nothing to do with the 
photos. He called the violation of Rose Cochran's privacy 'reprehensible.'

She has lived in St. 
Catherine's Village nursing home in Madison for the past 13 years.The couple have been married 50 years and have two children together.

The 
Cochran family says she has lost the ability to speak and is receiving 
hospice care.

Police investigator Vickie 
Currie said in city court Thursday that when blogger Clayton Kelly 
photographed Rose Cochran on Easter Sunday, it was his third attempt to 
do so.

Kelly told investigators that he photographed her through a door 
that opened to a hallway, his attorney, Kevin Camp, told The Associated 
Press.

Cochran's campaign has started running a
 TV ad that mentions the photo incident, shows Kelly's jail mug shot and
 identifies Kelly as a McDaniel supporter. A narrator says: 'Rise up 
and say `no' to dirty politics.'

McDaniel 
responded in a statement Friday: 'It is disturbing that a United States 
Senator would resort to dishonest attacks and using this incident for 
political purposes in order to hold on to power. I call on Senator 
Cochran to immediately take down this disgusting negative ad and instead
 start talking about the issues of importance to Mississippians.'

Senator Thad Cochran has called an alleged plot to film his wife in hospice care for a political ad 'bizarre'

Kelly
 was arrested May 17, and is charged with exploitation of a vulnerable 
adult, conspiracy and photographing or filming of a person without 
permission where there is an expectation of privacy.

The
 three people arrested Thursday were attorney Mark Mayfield of 
Ridgeland, a Central Mississippi Tea Party board member who has helped 
raise campaign cash for McDaniel; elementary school teacher Richard 
Sager of Laurel; and John Mary of Hattiesburg, who took over hosting a 
conservative talk radio show formerly hosted by McDaniel. Mary used John
 Bert as his on-air name. McDaniel left the radio job before his 
election to the state Senate in 2007.

Mayfield
 is charged with conspiracy.

Sager is charged with evidence tampering 
and conspiracy. Mary is charged with conspiracy involving the 
exploitation of a vulnerable person and photographing or filming of a 
person without permission where there is an expectation of privacy.

Cochran campaign spokesman Jordan 
Russell said any suggestion that the 76-year-old six-term senator is 
having an inappropriate relationship with another woman is 'outrageous 
and offensive and the dirtiest form of politics. As we see from the 
arrests today, these people will stop at nothing to smear Thad Cochran, 
including a despicable act like the one committed against Rose Cochran.'

The Cochran family says Mrs Cochran has lost the ability to speak and is receiving hospice care.

During
 questioning in court, Madison police investigator Vickie Currie said 
investigators believe the conspiracy was intended to use images of Mrs 
Cochran to advance allegations Cochran was having an inappropriate 
relationship. Currie said it was Kelly's third attempt to photograph the
 72-year-old woman.
