Monica Lewinsky is no stranger to being on the receiving end of some high profile scorn, but she recently revealed that learning Hillary blamed her for the affair proved to be the most unbearable insult of all.

Lewinsky cited recently released papers from a longtime Hillary Clinton friend in which the former first lady called the once White House intern a 'narcissistic loony toon.'

'I find her impulse to blame the Woman...troubling,' Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair.

Troubling the 40-year-old even further is the ever-present possibility Hillary will again run for president, a possibility Lewinsky admits she fears could drive her back into tormented seclusion.

Blaming the woman: Monica Lewinsky doesn't like that recently revealed documents show that Hillary Clinton called her a 'loony toon' during the Clinton sex scandal

Putting on a smile: Lewinsky, seen here at a May 22 NYC gala, has had few reasons to be happy in the decade since she last ducked out of the public spotlight

Before she questions Hillary's feminism, Lewinsky first empathizes with the former first lady.

'Given my experiences with Linda Tripp, I know better than anyone what it’s like to have a conversation with a girlfriend exposed and scrutinized, taken out of context,' she writes.

Clinton's 'loony toon' remark was one of many recently revealed comments she made on the subject to her own confidante Diane Blair. However, Lewinsky says the parallel is anything but precise.

'I realize that Hillary Clinton was—unlike me when Tripp was prying loose my innermost secrets and insecurities and recording them surreptitiously—fully aware of this documentation,

'She’s the one who, according to the memos, asked Blair to keep a record or diary of their discussions for archival purposes.'

No matter how humiliated the scandal left Hillary, it was Lewinsky who wound up being condemned by society, which is why she said she was infuriated to learn of Hillary's remarks.

'Narcissist? Loony?' wrote Lewinsky. 'You might remember that just five days before the world had ever heard my name the F.B.I. entrapped me in a terrifying “sting” in the Pentagon City mall.'

Lewinsky went on to describe her 
interrogation by Ken Starr's threatening minions, whose demands she wear
 a wire tap while speaking with Clinton confidantes she refused.

'That, I couldn’t do. Courageous or foolish, maybe,' she wrote.

Meanwhile,
 as speculation around the possibility Hillary will make another run for
 the White House builds, Lewinsky's response to the 
will-she-or-won't-she question is: I hope not.

'In
 2008, when Hillary was running for president, I remained virtually 
reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests. I put off 
announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election

'Recently
 I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of “becoming an issue” 
should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on 
hold for another 8 to 10 years?

'Being
 a conscientious Democrat—and aware that I could be used as a tool for 
the left or the right—I have remained silent for 10 years.,' wrote 
Lewisnky. 'So why speak now? Because it is time.'
