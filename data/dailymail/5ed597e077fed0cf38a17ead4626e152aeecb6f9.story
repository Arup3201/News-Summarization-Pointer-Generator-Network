An eight-year-old boy ran up a £1,200 bill watching videos on his mother's iPad  - after it hooked up to paid-for internet connection during a powercut.

Aaron Little spent hours watching the popular Minecraft videos on YouTube, not realising that the tablet had connected to the expensive 3G network at his home in Edinburgh.  

The youngster usually watches videos online via the family's WiFi, but recent plumbing works at their flat forced labourers to turn off the power supply.

It meant the device automatically connected to Vodafone 3G network and his mother Lyndsey was sent a bill for £718.59, and asked to pay within a week.

Eight-year-old Aaron Little ran up a £1,200 bill watching videos on his mother Lyndsey's iPad - after it hooked up to a premium contract net connection during a powercut

She said she was warned that unless she did her contracts would be terminated and the bill raised to £1,209.14.

But Ms Little, a single mother on benefits, has been unable to pay, and has now been landed with the bigger figure.

Aaron said: 'We just got a big, big bill and we have to pay. I'm upset because I didn't know about it. I only know because my mum told me.'

The mother-of-four, said she was 'devastated' by the bill run up by her youngest son.

She said: 'We are trying hard to stay afloat with bills and stay on top of things. Then a bill for £700 came out of nowhere. I was devastated.

He usually watches videos online via the family's WiFi - but recent plumbing works at his flat forced labourers to turn off the power supply - and the tablet connected to the 3G network. His mother Lyndsey was sent a bill for £718.59, and asked to pay within a week

She said she was then sent a letter and warned that unless she paid her contracts would be terminated and the bill raised to £1,209.14

'I was shocked when I saw the bill. It said that if I didn't pay within a week, they'd cut off everything and I would have to pay £1,200.

'I sat Aaron down in the car when he came back from school. He cried and cried and said he was sorry. He's only eight and it wasn't his fault.

'He was just watching Minecraft. There's nothing wrong with that. It's educational and teaches kids to build things.

'I don't know what we can do. It's upset the whole family.'

Aaron ran up the bill when he accidentally connected to the premium network while council workers put a new shower into his flat over three days in early August.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs. 

Ms Little, who has been a Vodafone customer for 12 years, tried to discuss the situation with staff at the company's store on Princes Street, Edinburgh.

She explained the bill amounted to three-quarters of the family's monthly income and that they could not afford to pay the weekly minimum instalments of £60.

But Vodafone employees told her she was responsible for paying off her son's debt.

The company said it would terminate the contracts linked to the iPad and two phones used by her other sons.

Lyndsey said: 'Everything on the iPad was password-locked to avoid hidden charges or inappropriate content.

'I went in to see Vodafone and they said the iPad was working fine and that the problem had been caused by my son.

'I showed them my benefits and paper work and told them how much I get, but they didn't want to see it.

'I wish they could have been more understanding. They are treating me like they don't care and it's left me upset.

'I had to explain to my other sons that their phones may have to be cut off.

'I wish Vodafone would tell you upfront about these little loopholes in the system. These devices should have a £100 cut off to protect families with low incomes.'

A spokeswoman for Vodafone yesterday said they would be prepared to arrange a payment plan with her.

Earlier this month a mother was left with a £7,000 bill after her 12-year-old son ran up huge charges playing a popular online game on his phone.

Theresa Cox said she and her son James were not given any warning about costs of up to £240 a day on Clash of Clans.

T-Mobile said Supercell, the developer of the game, was responsible for setting the charges.

But Ms Cox, of Breaston, Derbyshire, said she might now have to sell her car to pay the debt.

James was playing Clash of the Clans on his smartphone where he was paying £240-a-day for add ons

Ms Cox's son inadvertently paid extra charges that are used to progress in the game.

Smartphones and tablets often operate on a system where applications themselves are free but various add-ons will then be offered to you in exchange for money.

This could take the form of in-game credits or 'currency' to help secure game upgrades or unlockable content or extra features with the application.

But there are options to turn off in-app purchases off on different systems.

On Apple's iOS the 'restrictions' menu it is possible to turn such purchases off altogether or set your own password.

Tap on 'Settings' then 'General' and 'Restrictions' then tap 'Enable Restrictions' and choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm.

At this point it's possible to set restrictions from a menu and in the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off'.

On Google Android open Google Play Store and cselect 'Menu' and then 'Settings' and under 'User Controls' there is an option to enter the PIN to confirm. At this point, tick the box to 'Use PIN for purchases' - anyone wanting to make a puchase in the app will have to know the PIN.

On Amazon Kindle Fire open the Amazon Appstore app and choose 'Menu' then 'Settings' and then select 'Parental Controls before tapping on 'Enable Parental Controls'.

At this point you can enter your Amazon password or tick the 'Use PIN' box, if you prefer a PIN.
