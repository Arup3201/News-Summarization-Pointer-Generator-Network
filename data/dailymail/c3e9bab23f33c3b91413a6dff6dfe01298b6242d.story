Rosie O'Donnell thanked Barbara Walters for giving her two shots on The View as she bid farewell to the troubled ABC show today.

Holding her little daughter Dakota, Rosie, 52 - who spoke out yesterday to say the program needs leadership and its founder Barbara Walters - said: 'Thank-you to the cast and crew and mostly to Barbara Walters who has always looked out for me in my life and career and is an amazing woman.

'We had lunch yesterday, I want to thank her for making this show and letting me be on it twice. 

'We’ve had fun, I hope we're gonna have more, I’ll come back and do an occasional crafting segment 'cause I have a hot glue gun and I will travel.

When quizzed by Saturday Night Live star Kenan Thompson about her departure, Rosie joked that he could be her replacement, adding: 'I have a lot of stress, some home stuff, some kid stuff, I gotta turn down the stress in some areas.'

When the comic asked: 'Can you go and come back?', she replied: 'Maybe!' 

Rosie announced she was leaving the troubled ABC daytime show on Friday - as she revealed she had split from her wife Michelle Rounds.

The feisty star - who said that 'something had to give' - was planning to pre-record her last show.

However, an ABC source told Daily Mail Online that her farewell show would be live today, adding: 'For production reasons Friday’s show was taped on Tuesday, but Rosie wasn’t part of it.  

'It didn’t make sense to tape her final appearance so many days in advance of her actual last day, plus Rosie Perez can’t do taped shows because she has to leave for theater rehearsals right after the live show ends at noon.'

She walked out on set, dancing to Flo Rida's hit Low, and was greeted to chants of 'Rosie' from the audience.

'If you had done that every day I probably would have stayed.' she joked, as she high-fived her co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie Perez and Nicole Wallace. 

Speaking at a lunch in New York yesterday, Cindy Adams of the New York Post reported Rosie said: 'The View, which I loved, changed. Not the same. It needs Barbara Walters. It now lacks leadership.'  

She'll be back: Rosie Perez left with food after the show was filmed but unlike the other Rosie, will be filming again next week - even though she was on the verge of being ousted last month

Rosie, a mother-of-five, suffered a heart attack in August 2012, and said she was worried about the stress of her personal life on her health.

'Stress is a major contributing factor to heart disease and heart attacks,' the comedienne told Entertainment Tonight the Athena Film Festival in New York City on Saturday.

She was there to introduce the world premiere of HBO Documentary Films' Rosie O'Donnell: A Heartfelt Stand Up. 

She said: 'You can't really minimize it so I'm having a lot of stressful situations in my family life at the moment and having stressful situations in my work environment, so something had to give. Most easy way to accomplish the lessening of the stress is to not go to work for right now.' 

She also addressed persistent reports that her departure had to do with disagreements with co-hosts and said: 'No. This is definitely about my heart. It’s about [the] company of Disney being amazing.'

She continued: 'When I sat down with them and said, "Here is the deal, this is what's been going on with me personally and professionally," they were great…It’s not about anybody else.'

'It never was and it never will be. Everybody wants a show to work and for it to succeed. But [what] you want mostly is to take care of your health. [You] can't produce a documentary telling people here's the way to be healthy and then ignore them.'

Her co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie Perez joined her, arriving bundled up in the cold.

Rosie O'Donnell's sudden departure was from The View prompted by rows with producers and other staff, who are said to be delighted she is leaving - but she said she had to concentrate on her family following her marriage split

O'Donnell and Michelle Rounds married in June of 2012, beginning their relationship in 2011, two years after Rosie split from her first wife Kelli Carpenter in 2009

They adopted baby daughter Dakota in 2013. Rosie also has daughters Chelsea and Vivienne and son Blake from her first marriage to Kelli, and son Parker who she adopted in 1995.  

As soon as the show was over, O'Donnell left in a car from outside the studios and a nanny took her daughter out separately to another car.
