The Israeli military has today shelled the Lebanese border in retaliation for being struck by two rockets, it has emerged.

Five rockets were launched on Sunday morning according to Israeli authorities, though only two are thought to have landed near the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. 

Artillery was fired towards the source of the launch shortly afterwards according to a military statement.

More than 30 shells hit a mountainous region around the southern Lebanese border near Rachaya, say witnesses. 

Officials confirmed no one had been injured as a result of the violence which has sparked concern after the two countries remained peaceful following a 2006 ceasefire.

It was not immediately clear who initiated the rocket attack, though a U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon said it was working with the Lebanese Army to obtain further 
details.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said Israel 'would not tolerate' such attacks against it and held the government and army of Lebanon responsible for any fire emerging from its territory.

'We will not allow incidents such as those of this morning to pass quietly,' he said in a statement.

'I would not recommend to anyone to test our patience and your determination to protect the security of the people of Israel.'

In a statement, Defence Minister Moshe
 Yaalon said Israel held the Lebanese government and military 
responsible for the rocket attack, the first along the frontier since 
August.

Yaalon said the military responded with 'massive shelling 
toward the (rocket) launch area, and if needed will use even greater 
force'.

There have been no reports of further cross-border conflict following the exchange that took place this morning.

The
 Israeli border in Lebanon had been relatively quiet since a month-long 
war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas tormented the region in the 
summer of 2006.

Over a thousand Lebanese were killed 
and some 160 Israelis died in the conflict which was brought to an end 
with a UN-brokered ceasefire after 34 days of violence.

There
 have been sporadic bouts of unrest in the region since, with the most 
recent being the death of an Israeli soldier who was killed by a 
Lebanese army sniper.

The incident is thought to have been an isolated act.

A
 car bombing in an upscale district of Beirut on Friday 27th shook the 
city and prompted an increase of military presence throughout the 
country. 

South Lebanon is a stronghold of the 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group which is currently engaged in Syria's civil war in support of 
President Bashar al-Assad.

Palestinian factions are also in the 
area, with some small bands of militants laying claim to rocket attacks.
