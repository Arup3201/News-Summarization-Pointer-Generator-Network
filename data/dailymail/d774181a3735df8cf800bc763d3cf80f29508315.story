Rio Ferdinand has questioned whether football has the power, or indeed the will, to eradicate racism following the shameful scenes involving Chelsea fans on the Paris metro earlier this week.

Footage emerged late on Tuesday night of a group of supporters twice pushing a black man off the carriage before chanting 'we're racist, we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' as Chelsea drew 1-1 with PSG in the Champions League.

QPR defender Ferdinand, who was himself embroiled in a race row after Chelsea captain John Terry was found guilty by the FA of racially abusing brother Anton, described the scenes in Paris as disgraceful and insists it is the job of society, not football, to do more.

'The racist scene on the metro with the Chelsea fans-disgraceful behaviour obviously,' The former England international tweeted. 'But can football change this? Does it have the power?

'Does football want to change this? Do the people in the game that hold the power really want to put the hard yards in to eradicate racism?

'Football has come a long way since the 70's & 80's but are we all guilty of becoming a bit complacent?

'Football has done a lot over the years to combat racism..but society has to do more to make change or is there too much hatred in society?'
