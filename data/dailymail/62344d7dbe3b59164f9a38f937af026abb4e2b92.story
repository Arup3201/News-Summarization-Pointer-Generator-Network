A new study about drug usage in the workplace has revealed that a shocking number of Americans have shown up to work high. 

A whooping 9.74% of people surveyed in a poll conducted for Mashable claim they have gone to their place of employment high on marijuana.

Even more shocking perhaps, is the fact that 80.77% of those people admit to obtaining the drug illegally.

High times: A survey found that 9.74% of Americans have shown up to work high on marijuana

Marijuana is currently legal in Washington and Colorado, and legal for medicinal purposes in 23 states and Washington, D.C. 

And it's not just weed that people are getting high with before they start their workday.

3.37% of those asked said they had taken a drug other than marijuana before work, and 28.28% said they had gone in while under the influence of prescription pills.

The number of pill users is less concerning than it appears however, as 95.36% of those individuals were taking pills that had been prescribed by their doctor.

Testing: Most employers in the U.S. do not not drug test their workers

This survey was conducted across all age groups, and split evenly between men and women.

Furthermore, 67.6% of those who participated had a bachelor's degree or higher, and 39.25% reported a household income of over $100,000. 

Most workplaces do not require employees to be drug tested, and only private employers can legally demand drug tests of their employees, without notice, under the United State's Department of Labor's Drug-Free Workplace Policy Builder.
