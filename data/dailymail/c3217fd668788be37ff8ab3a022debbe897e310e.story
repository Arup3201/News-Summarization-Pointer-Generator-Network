Luke and Anne Owens married this year despite a 22 year age gap and celebrated their nuptials with a Beatles themed ceremony 

A pair of Beatles super-fans are proving love is all you need having got married despite a 22-year age gap.

Luke Owens, 27, and Anne, 50, met in 2010 at the secure unit where they both work as mental health nurses.

Four years later, the couple married in a Beatles-themed ceremony and are preparing to jet off on their honeymoon to a Beatles festival in Kentucky, Louisiana, in May.

Anne says that for her it had been love at first sight.

'I'd worked at the hospital for 20 years when I first met Luke, and I knew he was the one as soon as I met him,' she said.

'He'd just started at the medical centre, and when I first saw him I thought he was dead cute.

'I initially thought he was about 30, but he actually turned out to be 22 - I was 44.'

Anne said she is often mistaken as much younger than her years, whereas Luke looks older for his age. And so despite a 22-year age gap, Anne decided to pursue Luke.

She said: 'I wasn't sure whether he was interested or not at the start because he seemed a little shy, but I always used to make a beeline for him.

'I used to go out of my way to get shifts swapped with friends so that we could work together.

'One day, I hinted at a little date and gave him my number. We started texting and it went from friends to flirty, and then one night I decided to just give him a kiss and see what happened.'

Luke says that he was glad that Anne had made the first move as he would never have had the confidence to. 

'It was Anne that asked me out. I wouldn't have done it myself because of the age gap,' he said.

'I knew she was a bit older than me, but I was a bit worried at the start because I didn't know how old she was - you get told not to ask women her age so I waited a couple of months to find out.'

Anne and Luke married on September 6 last year at the Hard Day's Night Hotel and every aspect of the wedding was devoted to the couple's favourite band

The Beatles super-fans wedding included a John Lennon Rolls Royce 

While Luke and his groomsmen wore Beatles-themed suits Anne opted for a traditional wedding dress 

The theme was complete with a 'All You Need is Love' wedding cake 

Although the pair suffered a little backlash at the beginning of their relationship Luke eventually received kudos for pulling an older woman. 

'People laughed a bit at the start, but most people thought it must be good to be with an older woman,' he said.

'I got a few high fives off my mates - I think it earned me a few brownie points.'

Anne said that although Luke was 'slow on the uptake' age gap relationships have benefits.

'Luke is quite romantic for his age. He's caring, thoughtful and funny. He doesn't take life too seriously, which is just so much more fun and makes me feel younger.

Luke, 27 had been too scared to ask Anne, 50, out and so she made the first move after Luke began working in the same hospital and five years later they were married 

'Fifty year-old men seem so serious, but Luke's happy and carefree,' she said.

'He doesn't take life too seriously which is so much more fun. It rubs off on me and makes me feel younger.'

Despite the pair sharing a love for the Beatles, Luke is the most dedicated fan of the two, and even organised a Beatles themed wedding.

Now the Beatles fans are flying to Kentucky in May for their Honeymoon and Luke has even launched an online campaign to get Paul McCartney's autograph so he can get it tattooed on his body 

Anne and Luke married on September 6 last year at the Hard Day's Night Hotel and every aspect of the wedding was devoted to the couple's favourite band.

They walked down the aisle to John Lennon, cut their own Love is All You Need themed wedding cake, and arrived at the venue in the famous John Lennon Rolls Royce.

Luke and his groomsmen even wore Beatles themed suits at the ceremony, while Anne opted for a classic fishtail bridal gown. 

Luke has seven Beatles tattoos which took 11 and a half hours to complete 

The couple are flying to Kentucky in May for a late honeymoon, where they will go to Beatles festival Abbey Road on the River. 

Luke has even launched an online campaign to get Paul McCartney's autograph so he can get it tattooed on his body.

Luke has seven Beatles tattoos, including a Penny Lane-themed sleeve, as well as the full band tattooed on his back, which took 11 and-a-half hours to complete.

Anne said: 'I thought Luke's tattoos were a bit weird at first, but I like them now. I think The Paul McCartney on his arm is my favourite.

'He tried to persuade me to get one - but I'm not so sure for now.'
