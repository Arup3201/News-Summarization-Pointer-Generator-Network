Photos of the police officer performing a sex act in uniform were leaked and an investigation was launched by senior police bosses

Police in Puerto Rico have suspended a female police officer after photos of her performing a sex act in uniform ended up being leaked to fellow officers.

According to a police insider, the images were taken by a male colleague at the police station and were posted onto social media.

But not long after, they ended up on the phones of most officers in the country and quickly went viral.

When senior police officers heard about it they launched an investigation to find out if the images were genuine, and quickly identified the police officer as being a serving member of the force.

They said that the young woman, Cynthia Marrero Pomales, 29, was serving in Carolina, a town in north-eastern Puerto Rico near the capital San Juan.

They added that she had been suspended while an investigation was carried out over allegations that she had offended the honour of the police force and damaged its reputation in public.

She has reportedly been interviewed and given a statement but no details were given to local media.

In one of the pictures the young woman also has the flag of the United States draped over part of her body.

She reportedly uploaded the pictures herself on social media although it is understood that she had not intended for them to be shared outside of a small private circle of friends.

The superintendent of police in Puerto Rico, Jose Luis Caldero Lopez, confirmed the authenticity of the images and announced that the young policewoman has since been suspended.

This is not the first time a sex scandal has disgraced police in Puerto Rico.

In 2014, photographs of two cops performing a sex act inside the presidential palace were shared and published, resulting in the officers being expelled from the force.
