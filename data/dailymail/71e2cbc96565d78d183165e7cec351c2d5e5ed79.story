Colourful: Outspoken Leeds United chairman Ken Bates arrives Leeds County Court to answer Melvyn Levi's harassment allegations

Leeds United chairman Ken Bates used Elland Road stadium’s PA system to issue a ‘wanted’ notice for a former club director who he claimed owed him money, a court heard.

The 80-year-old owner also took to the airwaves to track down businessman Melvyn Levi, asking Yorkshire Radio listeners for tips as to his whereabouts as he sought to claw back more than £190,000 he said Mr Levi owed the club.

Leeds County Court heard Mr Bates told the club’s solicitor he would arrange for the station to broadcast a similar announcement every day for a fortnight, offering listeners dinner for two in exchange for information on his supposed debtor.

Mr Levi, 67, said the announcements led football fans to assume he was ‘some sort of fugitive’, and now he and his wife Carole are seeking damages for alleged harassment by Mr Bates, Leeds United and Yorkshire Radio, which broadcasts live commentary of the club’s matches.

This latest courtroom battle marks a new chapter in a dispute that has run since Mr Bates bought the club from the Yorkshire Consortium, of which Mr Levi was a member, in 2005.

Mr Levi was awarded £50,000 in 2009 after the chairman wrote libellous remarks about him in a Leeds United match day programme.

Now he and his wife claim they have suffered stress as a result of the broadcast announcement allegedly likening Mr Levi to a criminal on the run.

They also say comments made by Mr Bates in his programme notes amounted to speculation over the state of their marriage.

Yesterday - the third day of the case - the court heard from Jersey-based solicitor Hiren Mistry, who was instructed by the club as it sought to serve Mr Levi with a writ in December 2010. Mr Bates was pursuing legal action for more than £190,000 which he claims is owed to the club by Mr Levi and his business partner, Robert Weston.

Papers were served on Mr Weston without any problems but, when a process server arrived at Mr Levi’s home, the former director was not in.

The server asked whether he could leave the papers in Mr Levi’s letterbox, but it was decided that they should be handed to him personally, the court heard.

Mr Mistry told the hearing it was suggested to him that Mrs Levi, who was at the house, had been ‘evasive’ when asked by the process server where her husband was. He said the papers had to be served ‘urgently’ because any delay in the legal proceedings would be ‘costly’ to the club.

But Mr Mistry agreed he did not ask the server to try again, even after the club’s chief executive Shaun Harvey rang to say that Mr Levi had been spotted in a Leeds restaurant.

Simon Myerson QC, for the Levis, asked Mr Mistry: ‘Is it because Mr Bates had told you there would be announcements on Yorkshire Radio every day for two weeks, offering dinner for two for information provided?’

Mr Mistry said: ‘He did tell me that, yes.’

Mr Myerson continued: ‘Is it the case Mr Bates said “Don’t worry about service - we are going to put a radio announcement out”?’

‘Absolutely not,’ Mr Mistry replied. ‘Procedure is procedure.’

On hearing about the reported sighting of the Levis, Mr Mistry said: ‘If it was concrete we would have acted upon it.’

The lawyer told the court he did not instruct the relevant people to serve the legal papers as he wanted to keep legal costs down for Mr Bates and Leeds United.

In 2009, Mr Levi successfully sued Mr Bates for libel over articles written in the programme, and the Leeds chairman was ordered to pay £50,000 damages plus costs to Mr Levi.

The court has heard that Yorkshire Radio broadcast an announcement during Leeds’ home match against Leicester City on Boxing Day 2010, asking anyone who knew Mr Levi’s whereabouts to contact the club.

Mr Levi’s witness statement said: ‘I understand from people I have spoken to who were listening to the broadcast that an announcement was made before the match and again at half time asking if anyone knew of my whereabouts and, if so, to contact the club who wished to serve me with legal papers.

‘I am told by people at the match that a similar announcement was made over the club Tannoy system during and/or before the home match against Middlesbrough on January 1, 2011.

‘The people who I have spoken to who heard the announcement have said they assumed I was some sort of fugitive.’

The hearing was told Mr Bates also used his match day notes for the Middlesbrough game to speculate about why Mr Levi was not there and to imply the couple had spent Christmas apart.

Mr Levi said: ‘A number of people have since asked me if we are having marital problems and that is also very upsetting.’

Mr Bates has dismissed as ‘rubbish’ suggestions he used his column programme to pursue a personal ‘vendetta’ against Mr Levi.

The London-born executive took control of Leeds United seven years ago, paying £10 million for the club at a time when it was swamped with debt.

This was the second time he had stepped in to pull a team out of dire financial straits, having bought an embattled Chelsea for just £1 in 1982.

Mr Bates stayed at Stamford Bridge for 21 years, during which he gained a reputation for controversy until he sold Chelsea to Roman Abramovich in 2003.

Among the more headline-grabbing episodes was his rejected proposal in 1985 to combat hooliganism by fitting electric fences around the pitch.
