Singer songwriter Viktoria Modesta, who will feature in an advertising spot paid for by Channel 4 during Sunday night's X Factor final 

Channel 4 is to blow £200,000 on an advertising spot during the X Factor final which will feature a disabled singer as an alternative to 'painfully dull and manufactured' pop music.

The promotional ad will be screened on ITV on Sunday night in front of an expected 10million viewers, who will be tuning in to see which of the three finalists will be crowned the winner. 

It will show singer and model Viktoria Modesta, who wears a prosthetic leg, in the video for her Lady Gaga-style song Prototype.

The ad is being funded by Channel 4, who say they have given the singer the opportunity to showcase her latest song during the final as there are no other stars in the music industry with prosthetics.

Latvian-born Miss Modesta, who describes herself as a singer-songwriter, took the radical decision at the age of 20 to undergo a below the knee amputation to her left-leg to ease her mobility following an injury during birth.

The 26-year-old, who says she has been approached by X Factor but turned them down, said: 'For a long time, pop culture closed its doors on me as an amputee and alternative artist.

'I think people have always found it hard to know what to think or feel about an amputee who wasn't trying to be an Olympian. 

'In sports, ‘overcoming' a disability makes you a hero, but in pop there is no place for these feelings.

I have never felt comfortable thinking of myself as disabled and this has inspired me to actively challenge old-fashioned views and create a platform in mainstream pop-culture, with other artists, where I have always known I belonged.'

The singer also took part in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Paralympic Games and says the song Prototype shines a light on stigma, questions normal ideas of sex and beauty and celebrates being different.

An edited version of the song's video will be shown during an X Factor ad break and features Miss Modesta sitting on a throne before it shows a young girl pulling the leg off her doll after watching a cartoon version of the singer. 

It also shows her dancing around in elaborate outfits and being interrogated by soldiers. 

The ad is also part of Channel 4's Born Risky initiative, which also ran the 'Superhumans' campaign during the 2012 London Paralympics. 

The ad will show an edited version of Miss Modesta's video to her song Prototype, which she says shines a light on the stigma surrounding disability. 

Channel 4 say the ad is aimed at showing how 'painfully dull' and 'manufactured' pop music is today 

John Allison, joint head of 4Creative, said: 'We wanted to build on the legacy of the Paralympics work so we asked ourselves, "Why are there no disabled pop artists?"' 

'Pop stars these days are painfully dull and manufactured. Viktoria embodies our governmental remit of championing alternative voices and establishing new talent.' 

While Dan Brooke from Channel 4 added: 'Channel 4 was born to be different: to offer alternative perspectives and to take creative risks, especially with new talent.

The ad will be shown on Sunday night during the X Factor final, which will see Andrea Faustini, Ben Haenow and Fleur East compete to become champion 

'In a world of homogenised pop, Viktoria is those values in a nutshell. We are honoured to help her develop her career and change attitudes to disability in the process.'

Although Channel 4 is a publicly-owned broadcaster, it does not receive any public cash and is funded by its commercial activity, such as advertising. 

They have a remit to be innovative, experimental and distinctive.
