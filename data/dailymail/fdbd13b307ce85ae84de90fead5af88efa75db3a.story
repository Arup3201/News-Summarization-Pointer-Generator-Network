High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley told the couple to settle their differences over a cup of tea - and they managed it, which she described as 'pleasing'

A mother and father waged war for 10 years over their twin boys until a despairing judge ordered them to sort it out over a ‘nice cup of tea’.

During their bitter decade of conflict, the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children.

But the family judge’s simple suggestion brought miraculous results, with the parents now seeing eye-to-eye and sharing contact with their sons.

Mrs Justice Pauffley told the High Court yesterday: ‘I suggested that, when the boys were dropped off and picked up, each parent should be made welcome in the home of the other, invited to sit down around the kitchen table and offered a cup of tea.

‘Pleasingly, very pleasingly, against the background of the last 10 years, each parent reacted positively to that idea and it’s been good for the boys.’

She added: ‘The father, impressively, has taken the trouble to provide supplies of a particular health-giving drink for the mother, and I’m sure the mother has been responding with similar thoughtfulness when he’s called in at her home.’

It was even suggested they might now graduate to seeing each other over dinner, leaving other members of their families ‘gobsmacked’ at the outbreak of peace.

The protracted battle began not long after the twins were born prematurely 12 years ago.

They weighed just three pounds each and needed to spend the first eight weeks of their lives in hospital.

Even though their parents were described as ‘very respectable’ and in a long-term relationship, it put ‘enormous pressure’ on them, the court heard.

When the little boys came home, they were extremely weak and the mother was ‘intensely protective of them’.

The father ‘felt excluded’ and the parents’ relationship crumbled under the strain.

They split up before the twins reached their first birthday, and spent the next decade at war in the family courts.

When the mother and father - who have not been named - arrived for their umpteenth court hearing, the weary judge observed: ‘My sense was that I could have been doing little more than applying a sticking plaster to a deep and persistently infected wound.’

But, after the father described everyone in the family as ‘exhausted’ by the never-ending legal war, the judge made her cup of tea suggestion and sense began to prevail.

During their bitter decade of conflict, the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children, but Mrs Justice Pauffley told the High Court they had reacted to her advice positively

Both mother and father, ‘to their very great credit’, made concessions and agreed to build bridges.

The mother began to appreciate the father’s point of view, and he agreed it was impossible for him to say that she had ‘poisoned’ the children against him.

The mother had ‘felt under attack’ by her ex-partner and her sense that he was constantly ‘dragging her to court’ had become ‘almost too much for her to bear’, however, she had now come to recognise the importance of the father’s role in her boys’ lives.

After hot drinks warmed hearts around the kitchen table, the ‘quiet, respectful, polite and exceptionally well behaved’ 12-year-old boys wrote moving thank-you letters to the judge and came to London to meet her in her chambers.

The judge said: ‘If there was one thing the parents seemingly failed to do for all of the years they were in dispute, it was that they did not consider the impact upon the other - and the children themselves - of their actions.’

The judge added: ‘I am hopeful, very hopeful, that for the future similar mistakes will not be made. There is very little which frightens children more than an absence of appropriate parental guidance and firm boundaries about the things in life that matter most.’ The boys will now spend alternate weekends with each parent - who have both found new partners - and contact over school holidays and half terms will be shared more or less equally.

Mrs Justice Pauffley concluded: ‘The details will be worked out by the parents. They welcome without hesitation the firm message that this is a final order, that there is no need for any further court involvement and that any return to litigation would be a profoundly retrograde step.‘Thus, they are empowered to make the arrangements, whatever they might amount to, work.‘It has been a privilege to participate in this most satisfactory of collaborative efforts.’
