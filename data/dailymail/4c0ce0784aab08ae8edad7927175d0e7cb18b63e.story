Neolithic people 'packed' the base of the Garsdom Edge monolith with smaller stones and angled it precisely using the altitude of the sun

A seven-foot monolith in the Peak District was erected to track the sun 4,000 years ago, researchers believe - and could have been an important pagan site. 

Neolithic people 'packed' the base of the Garsdom Edge monolith with smaller stones and angled it precisely using the altitude of the sun.

The researchers believe the stone was put there for symbolic reasons, and angled precisely to catch light through the changing seasons.

At midsummer, the stone would 'light up' - but in winter, it would be permanently shadowed.

A similar cycle is used at other burial sites to symbolise eternity, the researchers say.

The people who raised the stone would have just switched from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to primitive farming.

Researchers carried out a detailed 'microtopography' survey of the ground around the monolith, and believe that stones were carefully packed aroun the stone.

A 3D model of how light strikes the monolith - adjusted for changes in Earth's tilt over four millennia - shows that the stone was very precisely angled to catch the sun.

 The orientation and inclination of the slope is aligned to the altitude of the Sun at mid-summer.

The Nottingham Trent University researchers believe that the monolith was set in place to give symbolic meaning to the location through the changing seasons.

The landscape surrounding the stone harbors many ancient monuments such as Bronze Age roundhouses, a late Neolithic enclosure, and other traces of a long lasting human occupation.

‘Given the sensitivity of the site, we can’t probe under the surface of the soil. However, through our survey, we have found a higher density of packing stones on one side, supporting the case that the stone has been orientated intentionally,’ said Dr. Brown.

 The 3-D modeling shows that during the winter half-year, the slanted side of the stone would remain in permanent shadow; during most of the summer half-year it would only be illuminated during the morning and afternoon; close to midsummer it would be illuminated all day.

The researchers are currently backing up the modeling work by gathering contemporary photographic evidence of the stone. ‘The stone would have been an ideal marker for a social arena for seasonal gatherings,’ said Dr. Brown. ‘It’s not a sundial in the sense that people would have used it to determine an exact time. We think that it was set in position to give a symbolic meaning to its location, a bit like the way that some religious buildings are aligned in a specific direction for symbolic reasons.’ The researchers hope that the new evidence will support the case for a wider archaeological survey of the site. ‘The use of shadow casting in monuments of this period is quite rare in the British Isles,’ said Dr. Brown.

‘But there are some examples including New Grange, Ireland, and some Clava cairns in the north-east of Scotland that have been proposed to include the intentional use of shadows.

'Both are associated to burial sites using the symbolism of a cyclic light and shadow display to represent eternity. Given the proximity of the Neolithic enclosure and possible ritual importance of this site, the Gardom’s Edge monolith could be another such example.’
