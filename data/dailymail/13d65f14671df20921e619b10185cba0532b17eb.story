UKIP launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians last night after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light.

Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, next month, is the latest candidate  to cause embarrassment to UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Mr Bilcliff took to Twitter to declare: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’

Mr Bilcliff said he could see how he posts could be construed as prejudiced but claims he is not

Mr Bilcliff is just the latest in a line of party members to put Mr Farage in an embarrassing position with their controversial remarks

A separate Facebook post in July 2012 allegedly made a joke against Muslims.

Last night Mr Bilcliff admitted he could see how his comments could be viewed as homophobic and racist, but was adamant he was neither.

He said: ‘I am not racist and never have been. I have many friends of different nationalities but I enjoy a joke every now and again.’

A UKIP spokesman said the matter had been referred to the party’s national executive with  a view to disciplinary action.

Last week builder Andre Lampitt, seeking to become a councillor in Merton, South London and who featured in a UKIP election broadcast, was suspended after making racist remarks on Twitter that the party said were ‘repellent’.
