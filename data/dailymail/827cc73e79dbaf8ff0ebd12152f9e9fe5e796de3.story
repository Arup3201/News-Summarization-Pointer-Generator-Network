A 39-year-old man who leaped from a second-floor balcony to his death inside a Queens casino yesterday was on a winning streak.

Sayed Alam was up by about $1,200 on the slot machines when he plunged 30-feet inside the Resorts World Casino at Aqueduct Race Track just before 6pm.

Dozens of people were standing in the main lobby of the gambling hall 
on Rockaway Blvd in South Ozone Park when the man jumped, New York Daily News reported.
