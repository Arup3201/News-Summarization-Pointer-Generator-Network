Manchester United starlet Tyler Blackett believes that being a local lad gives him greater incentive to do well, especially in the derby.

The 20-year-old defender has been blooded by Louis van Gaal this season - making six first-team appearances - in the wake of experienced players like Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic leaving the club.

Blackett was brought through the Academy and admits he is now 'living the dream' after breaking through into the senior side, although he is taking nothing for granted.

Speaking to the official Manchester United website, Blackett said: 'I was brought up here in Manchester and playing now for United is like a dream come true. Hopefully, I'll continue to do my best for the club.

'Being a local lad, there's extra pressure but it's something I thrive on. As one of the more local lads, I know what this club means. Don't get me wrong, the foreign players know Manchester United as well but being a local lad gives you extra incentive to do well.

The Manchester derby will give Blackett a chance to claim bragging rights against City fans in his area

There are few bigger games for a homegrown player than the Manchester derby against neighbours City at the Etihad on Sunday, and Blackett admits bragging rights will be at stake.

'I'm from Hulme, right in the city centre,' he said. 'There are City fans where I live and I get a bit of stick now and again but it's all good banter and good to be around it. There's a lot more of them now!

'Everyone in my family is a United fan and have always watched United over the years. With fans from both sides of Manchester being in the stadium, it provides an extra atmosphere to the ground. The derby is a great game to play in.'
