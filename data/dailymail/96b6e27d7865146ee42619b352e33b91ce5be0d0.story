A town council has been ordered to move a new war memorial because it breaches planning regulations – despite being just yards from a monument to those who died in the two world wars.

Shaftesbury Town Council has been told it faces criminal prosecution after it put up the 6ft monument to commemorate those who have died fighting for their country since 1945 without planning permission from English Heritage.

The memorial to the soldiers of the Dorset and Devon regiments is in the shadow of Shaftesbury Abbey.

The war memorial, pictured, was built without permission 15ft away from the wall of Shaftesbury Abbey (right)

But although the council owns the land surrounding it, the ruin itself is recognised by law as a ‘scheduled’ – or listed – monument.

The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 rules it is a criminal offence to carry out works to listed monuments – such as erecting the memorial – without consent from the Secretary of State.

The council defended the move, claiming it did not realise the Abbey had specially protected status.

English Heritage has now demanded the memorial be moved – and it refused to rule out prosecution should a solution not be found.

The quango said it was a ‘criminal offence’ to build the monument so close to the historic 9th-century abbey.

The council may have to move the war memorial after English heritage pointed out their mistake

The council could be fined up to £5,000. The 1979 Act does not allow for retrospective planning consent to be given.

The memorial was built of expensive white Portland stone, and £20,000 of its cost was covered by public donations.

The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 makes it a crime to carry out works to listed monuments without consent from the Secretary of State.

Anyone convicted under the act can face fines of up to £5,000.

English Heritage has demanded the 8ft monument be moved to a different location, and has refused to rule out prosecution.

The £30,000 monument was erected 15ft away from historic Shaftesbury Abbey

An English Heritage spokesman said: ‘Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, it is a criminal offence to carry out works to a Scheduled Monument without Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State.

'English Heritage is taking this matter seriously but our focus is on achieving a negotiated solution.

'There is no facility under the 1979 Act for the Secretary of State to issue retrospective Scheduled Monument Consent and so the matter of unauthorised works and criminal offence stands until the situation is satisfactorily resolved.

'Wherever possible, a negotiated solution is preferable and this is what we are currently pursuing with the Town Council.

Although Shaftesbury Town Council owns the land the memorial was built on, its proximity to a protected building means it needed special permission

‘I am sure this was put up with the best of intentions, and we have had constructive discussions with Shaftesbury Town Council about resolving the issue of unauthorised works involving the erection of a stone memorial at a Scheduled Monument known as Shaftesbury Abbey.

‘The Town Council is looking at options for moving the memorial in consultation with interested parties.’

Simon Pritchard, the Mayor of Shaftesbury, said: ‘The Town Council is currently in constructive discussions with English Heritage to resolve the issue of the new memorial recently erected on Park Walk within the Scheduled Monument of Shaftesbury Abbey.

‘Due to an oversight this was carried out without having obtained Scheduled Monument Consent.

The memorial is just 4ft away from a wall surrounding Shaftesbury Abbey, which is now mostly a ruin. A statue of King Alfred has been erected there, and the tower of another church can be seen in the background

'We are confident that a negotiated solution can be reached with English Heritage and the Town Council is looking at options, working together with English Heritage, the Royal British Legion, North Dorset District Council and the Civic Society to find the right location for the memorial.’

Shaftesbury Abbey was founded by Alfred the Great in 888 AD and his daughter Aethelgiva was the first abbess there.

The only part of the abbey that remains today is the excavated ruins of the abbey church within a walled garden, home to the Shaftesbury Abbey Museum.

Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, carrying out works on protected buildings is a crime if permission is not sought.

The legislation is designed to protect sites deemed to be of 'national importance' from unnecessary development.

There are no fixed rules stating what distance away from a protected building works can be freely carried out, but in this case the small distance between the memorial and the wall of the abbey would appear to mean the land was covered by the act.

More than 20,000 buildings are on the ‘schedule’ in England alone including Ironbridge in Shropshire, the missile shelter at RAF Greenham Common and Cadbury Castle in Somerset.

In order to carry out works on any scheduled monument, permission must be granted by a Secretary of State, and people who break the rules face fines of up to £5,000.

In 2006 a man was fined £1,230 for dumping waste on a protected hill fort in Tunley, Somerset, which was also a breach of the Environmental Protection Act.

Abbey is a protected building, and carrying out works nearby may be an offence
