The amount of young Australians suntanning has almost halved in the past ten years, according to new research.

Cancer Council's National Sun Protection Survey has found 38 per cent of young Australians aged 12 to 17 years old like to get a sun tan compared to 60 per cent a decade ago.

The council's chief executive officer Professor Ian Olver said the results were encouraging and most teens no longer viewed the 'bronzed Aussie' as something to aspire to.

But the study also showed teens were still not doing enough to protect themselves from the sun, with 23 per cent of teenagers reporting they were getting sunburnt on summer weekends.

Professor Olver said this figure had not shown 'significant' change since 2003-04, with the number of teenagers reporting getting sunburnt in 2013-14 dropping only one per cent compared to 10 years ago.

A total of 6,349 Australians were interviewed, including 1,061 adolescents aged 12 to 17, and they were surveyed over the three months of last summer.

Breaking the figures down by gender, females were more likely to suntan than males across all age groups.

In 2003-04, 54 per cent of men said they liked to get a suntan but that figure had dropped to 31 per cent in 2013-14.

But in women, this figure was 47 per cent in 2013-14 compared to 66 per cent in 2003-04.

The research, which was released on Monday, coincides with National Skin Cancer Action Week.

The week started on Sunday and runs until Saturday, and aims to remind young people to look after their skin cancer and take steps to make sure they are protected properly from the sun.

Professor Olver said although two in three Australians would be diagnosed with skin cancer by age 70, adolescents underestimated their skin cancer risk, with one in two rating their chances of developing skin cancer as 'low'.

'It's wonderful to see teens understanding that a tan isn't the hallmark of health it was once made out to be,' he said. 

'However, while most don't actively seek a tan, we do want them to actively protect themselves.

'Skin cancer doesn't have to be an inevitability. Take the recommended sun protection measures and the odds of preventing it are in your favour.'

The Australian College of Dermatologists are also getting behind the week.

Dermatologist Dr Patricia Lowe reminded young people that getting to know their skin was an important part of being sun safe.

'Make a habit of keeping an eye on your skin and getting to know what "normal" is for you,' she said.

'It doesn't take long and it can make the difference between early detection and not knowing until it's too late. 

'If you notice any changes, see your doctor because early detection of skin cancer almost always means it can be successfully treated.'

Former Australian Olympian Stephanie Rice is supporting this year's campaign and has urged young people to take their skin health more seriously to reap the long-term benefits.

'I've grown up outdoors and in the water and loved every bit of it but you have to be smart,' she said.

'Skin cancer can almost be considered our national cancer, yet it's so preventable. 

'When you're heading out, slip, slop, slap, seek and slide and make your summer a safe one.' 

This year’s theme of 'Your Summer. Your Skin. Your Story.' aims to raise awareness of the harsh effects of skin cancer while encouraging Australians to share their personal skin cancer stories and how it has impacted their lives.
