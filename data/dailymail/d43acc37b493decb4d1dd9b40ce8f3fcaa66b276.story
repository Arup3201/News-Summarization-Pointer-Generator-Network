A country song with a theme as old as time has some listeners up in arms - and some radio stations now refusing to put it on the airwaves.

Little Big Town has a hit with their new tune Girl Crush, selling an impressive 25,000 copies a week, a song about a girl who wants to get back her man.

That girl though is not afraid to admit she is a little bit jealous of her former man's new lady however, and some are now claiming the song 'promotes the gay agenda.'

The problem it seems is with one of the verses sung by group member Karen Fairchild, in which she croons; 'I want to taste her lips, yeah cause they taste like you / I want to drown myself in a bottle of her perfume / I want her long blond hair, I want her magic touch / Yeah cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much. . . I got a girl crush.'

And for this, a simple tale of jealousy, some stations are saying they are getting just as much outrage from listeners as when The Dixie Chicks criticized President Bush back in 2003.

'Is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the Top 10 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it’s a lesbian song?' radio host Bobby Bones asked the group during a recent interview according to The Washington Post. 

'Just the fact that we’re still discussing that, number one, there’s so many problems with that whole issue,' answered Fairchild.

Bones, who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said; 'It shouldn’t even matter if it’s a lesbian song, is the first thing.'

This is not the case for listeners however, with one individual in Texas writing in to say to a station after they played the song; 'You are just promoting the gay agenda on your station and I am changing the channel and never listening to you ever again!!' 

Alana Lynn, who hosts a morning show in Boise, Idaho, says she got a similar response from some listeners.

Newcomer Kacey Musgraves dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song Follow Your Arrow, listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013, was shunned as it included the lyrics; 'Kiss lots of boys / Or kiss lots of girls / If that's something you're into.'

Despite selling over 500,000 copies, the song never charted higher than 43 of the Billboard chart for country music radio airplay.

This has never been a problem on the pop charts meanwhile, with Katy Perry finding herself atop the Billboard Hot 100 with her debut single I Kissed a Girl. 

Now, the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song, with Fairchild saying; 'It’s about a girl saying, you know, "Why do you love her and not me?"'

The group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of airplay - Day Drinking.
