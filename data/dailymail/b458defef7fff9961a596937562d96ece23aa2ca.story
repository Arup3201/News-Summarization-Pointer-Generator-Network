Low calorie champagne contains the same amount of alcohol with almost half the calories of a regular glass

As a style editor with over 30 years experience in the fizz-guzzling fashion industry there's not much that Christa D'Souza doesn't know about champagne.

One things she DOES know is that she doesn't actually like the decadent drink all that much.

'It reminds me too much of all those dreaded press launches I had to go to when I first started out in magazines, all those over made-up PR ladies with lipstick on their teeth and slightly skew-whiff hair-dos and so forth…' the 53-year-old British journalist told Get The Gloss when they asked her to review the latest skinny champagne to be causing a stir.

'I don't like champagne, or "poo" as we used to call it in the early 90s, but with the dilemma of maintaining one’s, um,  girlish figure and being a highly functioning alcoholic. What to do, what to do? 

'Red wine gives one red veins, white wine is just too clichéd for words (don’t even talk about rose it’s WAY too fattening), so really there is only one alternative left… and that is champagne.'

Champagne generally contains around 100 calories per glass. The 'dosage' is the sugar added at the end of fermentation to 'finish' the Champagne and 12 - 17 per cent sugar is standard.

Whilst low sugar, and therefore low calorie, fizz is not a brand new idea - some of France's most prestigious brands offer extra dry versions of their biggest sellers - it usually comes with a hefty price tag that even regular champagne drinkers find hard to swallow.

Now a new kid on the posh plonk block, created by British ex showbiz journalist Amanda Thomson, is offering a guilt-free alternative at half the price.

Amanda, now a French wine expert trained at Le Cordon Blue in Paris, says she was inspired to create a low-calorie drink after her
 previous job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight 
from attending VIP parties.

Working with champagne maker Alexandre Penet she has created the no sugar Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru, which is now selling via her Thomson and Scott website for £49 per bottle and contains just 60 calories per glass.

The drink is described as 'high end Grand Cru with almost half the calories' - which sounds like the holy grail for thirsty fashionistas and showbiz hounds doing the rounds.

Amanda said:'We know that the British have a history 
of loving champagne, but in today’s more calorie-conscious market, I’ve 
found a producer who delivers a deliciously dry champagne, but with no 
added sugar.

‘The fashion crowd especially loves the idea of drinking fizz with less fat.’

So what is the verdict?

Christa says: 'I seriously think it is going to be the NEW THING. Part of the reason I’ve never liked champagne is the sick-y breath it gives you straight afterwards. There’s also the stonking headache you can get the day after if it’s not super, super expensive. But here’s the thing. Because this Grande Cuvee champagne is so very, very very BRUT, you don’t get the sickly sweet taste and nor do you wake up feeling you need to take the whole day off or you seriously might die. More importantly it is less calories than a single shot of vodka.

'We had it last night at dinner and although it might not have been quite butch enough for my friend James, us ladies, we loved it, got p****d on it and woke up perfectly able to cope with the new day.

'Does that sound like a champagne for the ladies? Like that beastly despicable marketing campaign by Bic to make “comfortable” pink and purple pens “just for her”? Well, it shouldn’t.  Forget my friend James, it is perfectly robust enough to serve at the most manliest of dinners,  with the considerable upside of not making one’s breath smell like vomit.

'Doesn’t the idea of ‘Low Dosage’ for women kind of make sense given that it’s been clinically proven that we cannot  biologically keep up with men on the alcohol front? And another thing. I’m tub-thumping here, but with the mounting evidence that sugar is actually the crack cocaine of the 21st century, I think we should all — man, woman, rough-haired terrier — be cutting down wherever we can.'

Amanda Thomson gave up her carrier as a TV journalist to study in Paris as a wine expert and has now launched a new sugar-free Champagne, 'Brut Nature'

Anne Shooter, the Mail Online's food and drink blogger, agrees that lower calories are generally better all round, but isn't sure it works for this extravagent drink: 'Obviously it is fantastic to have low-calorie champagne but the important thing with something as delicious and luxurious as champagne is that you are not compromising on flavour.

'Zero dosage champagnes can be so dry that they taste almost sour. If you are watching your calories, it might be one of those situations where you are better off having one glass of something fabulous rather than two glasses of something that doesn't taste great. However, if this can tick both boxes, it is clearly worth buying - particularly if champagne is your aperitif of choice.'
