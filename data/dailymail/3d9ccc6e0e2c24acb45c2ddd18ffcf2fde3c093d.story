The Queen today started the countdown to next year's Commonwealth Games as she handed over the official baton for a relay which will travel more than 120,000 miles around the world.

At the ceremony outside Buckingham Palace, Her Majesty placed a secret message inside the baton, which she will read out at the opening ceremony for the games in Glasgow in July 2014.

The unique object, crafted from titanium, wood and granite, will be taken to every Commonwealth country before it arrives in Scotland in June.

Today Sir Chris Hoy, Britain's most successful Olympian, carried the baton along The Mall accompanied by the pipers and drummers from the Scots Guards and Royal Scots Borderers.

The Queen then placed her message of support to the Commonwealth athletes inside the baton's lattice frame, before handing it over to former sprinter Allan Wells.

The message, written during the Sovereign's stay at her Scottish estate Balmoral this summer, will remain secret until she reads it out at the opening ceremony in Celtic Park on July 23.

Mr Wells, winner of four Commonwealth golds and the 100-metre sprint title at the 1980 Olympics, was joined by 25-year-old Monica Dzonzi, 25, a Unicef ambassador who runs a youth centre in Malawi.

The pair took the symbol of the Games on the initial leg of its global journey and were soon joined by the first of the many baton bearers.

At the Palace gates, Wells handed the baton over to swimmer and double Commonwealth gold medallist Caitlin McClatchey. It then made its way around the Queen Victoria Memorial twice, collecting more bearers as it went.

Those chosen included athletes, budding sportsmen and women, volunteers and schoolchildren involved with Glasgow 2014 projects.

After the ceremony, the baton was carried to nearby Marlborough House, home of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

It was followed by the spectacle of dozens of young people each carrying a flag of a Commonwealth nation or territory taking part in the Games.

Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 chairman, told the guests gathered at the Palace: 'Years of planning and preparations have gone into putting on the Games and we have now reached the moment when the countdown really begins.

'The baton is a tangible object. Thousands of people will carry it, and they will bring the Commonwealth to life in front of our eyes. As the journey unfolds, we will see a vast diversity of people, of landscapes and of cultures.'

The relay is a Commonwealth tradition that started in 1958, growing in scale with every Games.

It is similar to the Olympic torch relay and is designed to unite the citizens of the Commonwealth in a celebration of sport, diversity and peace.

Glasgow 2014 is the 20th Commonwealth Games, and its baton relay route is the biggest so far.

The baton will leave for India tomorrow and go on to visit every nation and territory of the Commonwealth, travelling through Asia, Oceania, Africa, North and South America, the Caribbean and Europe.

It was due to travel to 71 nations and territories in total, but part of the route is being redrawn following Gambia's decision not to participate in the Games.

The move comes days after the west African nation announced its departure from the Commonwealth, saying it will 'never be a member of any neo-colonial institution'.

The baton will spend an average of one to four days in each nation, with an extended duration of seven days in Wales, two weeks in England and 40 days in Scotland.

It will be in Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, over Christmas, bring in the start of 2014 in Sierra Leone and celebrate St Andrew's Day - dedicated to the patron saint of Scotland - in New Zealand.

The smallest island on the route is Nauru, also in the South Pacific, which has a populartion of less than 10,000 people.
