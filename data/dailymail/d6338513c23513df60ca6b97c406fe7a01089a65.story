Mr Starr has lodged a case and is prepared to sue Karin Ward following her allegation of child abuse

Freddie Starr is suing the woman who accused him of molesting her when she was 14 in a BBC dressing room.

The 70-year-old has launched a claim against Karin Ward for 'slander and malicious falsehood'.

Ms Ward said that Mr Starr groped her when she appeared on a Jimmy Savile show in 1974.

Mr Starr is seeking ‘substantial damages’ as his reputation has been ‘tarnished’.

The comedian, who spoke from his home in Warwickshire, lodged the claim at London’s High Court.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I will not rest until my good name has been cleared by the police and all of those who have publicly defamed me have been taken to court.’

It is thought that he could win damages worth tens of thousands of pounds if successful.

Sources close to him have said that Mr Starr feels his reputation has been ruined by the allegations and that his career is now over.

They added that it has devastated him financially as he has been unable to find work.

Ms Ward, 55, alleged on ITV news in October that he groped her following an appearance on variety show Clunk Click.

She said: I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my stepfather and it frightened me and freaked me out.’

He was first arrested by detectives 
from Operation Yewtree - the Scotland Yard inquiry set up in the 
aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal - in November of last year.

When further allegations emerged he was arrested again in April and he was re-bailed last week until October.

But, the case against him could be dropped before the October deadline.

Ms Ward said that she was abused regularly by Jimmy Savile

A spokesman for Mr Starr said: ‘The 
allegations certainly have not ever been supported by any corroborating 
evidence and our case is that her allegations are therefore clearly 
slanderous.’

Ms Ward said that she was regularly abused by Jimmy Savile himself.

She was a pupil at a school where the disgraced TV personality found several of his victims.
