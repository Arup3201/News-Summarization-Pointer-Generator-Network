When she fell pregnant in 2010 21-year-old Holly Griffiths didn't feel the same sense of joy that envelops most first-time mothers.

Instead the long-term anorexic was terrified at the though of gaining weight in order to be able to carry a healthy baby.

The pregnancy was a painful one that saw Holly having to cope with cracked ribs as her tiny frame struggled to cope with a growing baby but she desperately tried to gain weight and eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, named Dylan.

Almost three years later Holly is pregnant again, and still in the grip of anorexia. At eight and a half months and weighing just 8st 1lb she will be induced on Monday. Today she appeared on This Morning to discuss her daily struggle to gain weight as she carries her baby.

Talking about her first pregnancy Holly said: 'I didn't ever expect to get pregnant, I think it is pretty rare.

'I was at my darkest point when I got pregnant with Dylan. I was the thinnest I had ever been, I was the illest (sic) I had ever been.

'I had this massive guilt every time I ate because the anorexia still had a massive grip on me. And then I had massive guilt for not feeding, or not considering feeding my child.

Holly Griffiths, 21, has battled anorexia since she was a child. She managed to give birth to a healthy baby boy called Dylan (pictured) when she was 19 and now is pregnant with a little girl she has named Isla

does not look as if she is pregnant at all. She has been  is trying to put on as 
much weight as possible for her baby

5ft 7in Holly was eight when she 
started battling with her weight. She blames her condition on the 
pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes.

By 12 she had been admitted to a children’s psychiatric clinic weighing just 5st 5lb – about 3st underweight.

When Holly was pregnant with Dylan, now aged two, she was so thin that one of her ribs cracked as the baby grew.

She was induced at 37 weeks and gave birth after a labour of only ten minutes.

Dylan weighed 5lb 10oz and, to her 
relief, was healthy. ‘I was so lucky he was OK,’ she said. ‘I felt so 
guilty I had put his life at risk.'

Miss Griffiths admits that when she was told that she was pregnant with her first child Dylan she was terrified. She said she should have been over the moon but was upset she would not longer be able to control her weight

Miss Griffiths (pictured with fiance Harrison Bogbanovs after the birth of Dylan) was so small that when Dylan was in her womb he cracked her rib and started to crush her lungs. Because of this she was induced at 37 weeks

Miss Griffiths is pictured looking a slightly healthier weight while on holiday with her partner Harrison and baby Dylan. Miss Griffiths goes into periods of remission but is prone to relapses.

Now, at 34 weeks pregnant, she has been battling to gain weight before she gives birth to her daughter, who she will name Isla, despite the severe morning sickness that saw her lose 18lb in the earlier stages.

Normally, pregnant women are expected
to consume about 2,000 calories a day but Holly, who is engaged to the child's father, gym manager Harrison Bogbanovas, 24, makes do with 
between 800 and 1,200, eating one slice of toast for breakfast, salad 
for lunch, and plain pasta for dinner.

Holly, from Greenwich, South London said: ‘I suffered terrible morning sickness which caused my weight to drop, triggering my anorexia.

'I had thoughts of purging but didn’t
need to, my body was reacting in its own way. This made eating a lot  
easier, because I would just vomit it up anyway.’

'I lost a massive amount of weight and then got put on a strict eating plan - nothing rich, spicy or creamy, I needed very simple, basic foods to stop me being sick.'

Miss Griffiths (pictured, left, age six) 
developed anorexia when she was eight after ballet classes put pressure 
on her to lose weight. She has fought the condition for years and has 
gained a healthy weight for short periods of time. In summer last year 
she relapsed (right) and plummeted to seven stone despite being 5'7"

Psychologist Emma Kenny who appeared on the show with Holly and hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford said: 'The natural inclination to wish to starve oneself is always present in the mentality of any anorexic.

'But what Holly's situation shows is that with intensive therapy and treatment and a belief system that becomes a positive one i.e. I have got to feed this child, the pregnancy can continue and you can have a healthy baby. Also the learning experience in that is that if you put your mind to it you can continue that behaviour and then in the long-term overcome this disorder.'

Holly is carrying a girl that she has named Isla (pictured here in her 20-week scan). Doctors says the baby is doing well and is healthy despite her mother's low weight

Holly has had to see a high-risk maternity 
doctor, throughout her pregnancy and a 4D scan of the child shows she 
currently looks healthy.

Holly said: 'I'm not better yet but having Dylan kept me eating three meals a day and kept me from really relapsing or regressing. In the future I'm going back to treatment and I hope to kick it for good, it's really important for me to be able to be something that my kids want to emulate.

'I’m desperate to recover so I can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food.

'I couldn’t bear it if they had body issues like me, so I’m continuing to fight the voices in my head and get better for them.’
