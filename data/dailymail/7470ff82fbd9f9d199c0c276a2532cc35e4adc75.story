Bill Clinton has told Scots to reassure 'a world torn by identity conflicts' by voting No in an 11th-hour intervention in the independence debate.

The former U.S. president said he was reluctant to express his view before now because he appreciated the decision was 'Scots alone to make'.

But he said uncertainty over currency and the impact of 'long, complex' negotiations had convinced him to urge the people of Scotland to keep the Union.

Mr Clinton said: 'With so much turmoil and division across the globe, I hope the Scots will inspire the world'

In a statement released through the Better Together campaign: 'Because the independence vote is a decision for the Scots alone to make, and because Scots are already legendary for their independence of mind, I have been reluctant to express my views on the matter.

'I hope my decision to do so will be received in the spirit of friendship with which it is offered.

'I have watched the debate on the future of Scotland with great interest and admiration.

'With so much turmoil and division across the globe, I hope the Scots will inspire the world with a high turnout and a powerful message of both identity and inclusion.

'I understand and sympathise with those who want independence. Scotland is blessed with impressive human and natural resources and a strong desire for more widely shared prosperity and social solidarity.

'However, I hope the Scots people will vote to remain in the UK for several reasons: The proposal to keep the pound as its currency without the support that UK membership provides carries substantial risks, as we saw in the EU after the financial crisis.

'Separation will require a long complex negotiating process with considerable uncertainty and potential to weaken the Scottish economy.

'The increased autonomy promised Scotland by the UK provides most of the benefits of independence and avoids the downside risks.

'Unity with maximum self-determination sends a powerful message to a world torn by identity conflicts that it is possible to respect our differences while living and working together.

'This is the great challenge of our time. The Scots can show us how to meet it.'

Mr Clinton's statement came amid increasing hostility towards 'celebrity' or foreign backers to the No campaign - including Irishman Bob Geldof, who urged voters not to break up the Union despite not being part of it.
