A mother has drowned trying to save her nine-year-old son and his friend after their inner tube was swept away by strong currents on Lake Erie.

Kristen Stefan, a married stay-at-home mother who was described by friends as devoted to her son Tyler, was on vacation with the boy in Westfield, New York on Wednesday when tragedy unfolded.

Her son and his eight-year-old friend Benjamin were on an inner tube in the lake around 2.30pm when high winds drew them away from the shore, police and fire officials said.

Stefan, 37, swam out to help the boys, but all three were forced into a cove with cliffs.

Her son's friend managed to climb out on to the rocks, but as Tyler tried to get out, he fell back in, CBS Pittsburgh reported.

As Stefan tried to save him, she went under the water and did not resurface.

'My son said he just saw her hair disappear under the water,' Benjamin's mother, Erin Bignell, 35, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Tyler continued to drift and was eventually spotted by Matt Ward, 22, at a nearby beach. Mr Ward, a lifeguard and experienced swimmer, saw the boy struggling and swam out 100 ft to rescue him.

Tragic: Mrs Stefan was pronounced dead in hospital while her son was treated for hypothermia

'I was just worried that I wasn't getting to him soon enough,' he said. 'That's all that was in my mind.'

But he did reach the boy as emergency crews mobilized to help. Tyler was treated for hypothermia at a local hospital, before he was flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.

He is expected to be fine, but doctors are watching him for signs of pneumonia and infection, Bignell said. Her son was not hurt.

Mrs Stefan was pulled from the water but she was pronounced dead in hospital.

Neighbors back home in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania said that the stay-at-home mother and devout churchgoer had been 'joined at the hip' with her son.

'She was just nothing but wonderful to Tyler,' neighbor Kathy Narr told CBS.

Her husband Todd said on Facebook that he could not comprehend the tragedy.

'I love you allâ€¦ But feel so alone, betrayed, angered, heartbroken,' he wrote, CBS reported. 'I have no words. I can't sleep and have not eaten anything since I ate the lunch Kristen made me before she took the boys swimming.'

Funeral arrangements have not yet been made.
