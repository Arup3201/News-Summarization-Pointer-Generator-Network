A Russian oil baron and his business tycoon ex-wife have made legal history with a courtroom battle over their £6.4million former matrimonial home in London.

Alexei Golubovich and Olga Mirimskaya have followed in the footsteps of their son, Ilya, to become the first foreign dynasty in which two consecutive generations have sought the aid of the English courts in dealing with the fallout from divorce.

Mrs Mirimskaya, a multi-millionaire businesswoman who is boss of the Russian equivalent of Tesco, moved to London with her husband - a former top executive of giant Russian oil company, Yukos - and their three children in 2003.

Acrimonious: Russian oil baron Alexei Golubovich and his business tycoon ex-wife Olga Mirimskaya are fighting over assets in the UK courts

Battle: At the centre of the row is this £6.4m London home, in Chiswick, which both say they own

The family selected a prime piece of real estate as their palatial home on Upper Mall in Chiswick, on the banks of the Thames, attended by a full compliment of servants, including drivers and cleaners, to see to their every need.

However, when the pair separated in 2008, and divorced in Russia last year, the house and adjoining land, now estimated to be worth £6.4m, became a battleground, with each of the former spouses claiming it belongs to them alone.

Now the former couple have lodged papers with the High Court in London and are each suing the other in a legal tug of war, with the multi-million pound property as the prize.

The couple’s decision to bring their row to British shores follows hot on the heels of a battle between their son Ilya Golubovich and his ex-wife Elena which made headlines in 2011.

In that case, the Court of Appeal upheld a divorce judge’s decision to award Elena £2.85m after a marriage lasting just 18 months.

In a writ, Mrs Mirimskaya says that the off-shore company through which the house was bought in a complex series of transactions in 2004 was beneficially owned entirely by her and that the property was transferred into her sole name the following year.

Although the house was put into her husband’s name in 2008, she says it was 'the common intention' of both of them, right from the start, that she would continue to be 'the 100% beneficial owner of the property'.

Insisting that all expenses - 
including utility bills, taxes and staff costs - have been paid by her 
or companies controlled by her, Mrs Mirimskaya says her ex-husband holds
 the property on trust for her and she intends to give it to their 
daughter when she gets back legal title to it.

However,
 in his defence to the claim, Richard Wilson, Mr Golubovich’s barrister,
 insists that his ex-wife owns no part of the house.

He says Mr Golubovich came to love England as his home and ‘settled’ in the house with the then couple’s two younger children, their niece and his mother-in-law, whilst Mrs Mirmskaya ‘spent most of her time outside the United Kingdom’.

And the oligarch insists that the property was transferred into his sole ownership in 2008 as part of the agreed division of their assets, the marriage having broken down partly due to his wish to stay in England whilst his ex-wife wanted to live abroad.

Mr Wilson claims the transfer 'had the effect of removing the property from the joint ownership of the couple and transferring it to the sole ownership of Mr Golubovich...as a matter of English law he is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the property.'

Mr Golubovich has been described as one of Russia’s richest men and his ex-wife is chairman of Russki Product, Russia’s largest domestic producer of grocery goods.
