Identified: Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger has been identified as the first victim of the Quebec train derailment disaster. Up to 49 other victims are yet to be named

The first victim of a runaway oil train's explosive derailment in a Quebec town has been identified, more than five days since the disaster.

Eliane Parenteau, 93, lived alone in her home right next to the railway line, in downtown Lac-Megantic.

She was a high-spirited woman, the only remaining survivor of 11 siblings, and still lived in the family home where she raised her own children.

Defiant Mrs Parenteau had told her family that she did not ever want to end up in a nursing home, preferring to die in her own home.

Her son Michel Boulanger, described his mother as 'kicking and alive' and always had a humuorous approach to life.

In an interview with The Star prior to the coroner having identified her as a victim, he said: 'She had a spirit like David Letterman. She makes you a part of the joke.'

He said his mother was an industrious home-maker, taking pride in making her garden look nice by placing painted stones along the border with the footpath.

She was renowned for her strawberry-rhubarb pies and would always serve up generous portions when cooking for others.

In the summer she would set up chairs on her lawn so she and the neighbours could sit and listen to the town's frequent outdoor concerts.

She was a sociable and deeply spirited woman, who attended church regularly until she broke her hip. From then on she would watch mass on TV. She still rose at 4am every day to pray for those she loved.

Mrs Parenteau was born in the small and remote town of Wotton, in Quebec. The large family had to take a horse and carriage 16km every week to church.

When her brother became a priest at of Saint-Jean-Vianney Church, just outside Lac-Megantic, she started to work there as a chef and usher.

Inferno: 15 people are now confirmed dead and 45 are still missing as the train company president said the accident was caused by an employee failing to lock the set the brakes

Debris: Terrorism has been ruled out as a possible cause but there is still a criminal investigation underway

Shells: Burnt cars are seen near the train wreckage which was traveling far too fast when it went off the rails, investigators told reporters on Tuesday

It was while working at the church that she met her husband; he used to deliver the groceries to the church.

During the Second World War, Mrs Parenteau had worked in a factory making parachutes.

Mr Boulanger never gave up hope that his mother may have survived, telling The Star earlier this week, perhaps she was playing a trick and 'hiding somewhere'.

He last spoke to his mother on Thursday evening and he had told him she had had a senior citizens' meeting that day. He tried to call her Saturday but the phone was dead.

The incident left behind a scorched scene so dangerous that it has slowed the search for 50 people presumed dead.

Quebec's premier toured the town and sharply criticised the U.S. railways chief for not responding in person more quickly to Canada's worst railway disaster in nearly 150 years.

Police said four more bodies had been found, bringing the total found to 24.

The devastated downtown area remained dangerous for days after the crash as emergency crews put out fires and struggled to keep the remaining oil tankers cool so they would not explode.

The hazardous conditions delayed the search for the missing - and now for bodies.

Officials also have warned that identifications would be made more difficult by the incinerated scene.

Conditions had at least improved enough for nearly all the 2,000 residents forced to evacuate after the crash - a third of the population - to return home, the town's mayor said.

Quebec premier Pauline Marois arrived in the town and renewed her criticism of Edward Burkhardt, president and CEO of U.S.-based Rail World, which owns the runaway train.

'The leader of this company should have been there from the beginning,' she said at a news conference.

Mr Burkhardt arrived in the town for the first time on Wednesday with a police escort, facing jeers from residents.

He has said he delayed his visit to deal with the crisis from his Chicago office, saying he was better able to communicate from there.

'I understand the extreme anger,' he said. 'We owe an abject apology to the people in this town.'

He has blamed the engineer for failing to set the brakes properly before the unmanned train hurtled down a seven-mile incline, derailed and ignited. All but one of its 73 cars was carrying oil, and at least five exploded.

Mr Burkhardt's arrival in the devastated town was met with much anger by residents

Mr Burkhardt said the engineer had been suspended without pay and was under 'police control'.

Anger at the railway officials among residents appeared to mount on Thursday.

Lac-Megantic's mayor, Colette Roy-Laroche, said a hoped-for meeting with Mr Burkhardt did not materialise.

'I am angry with the fact that he did not communicate with me sooner,' she said.

At Mr Burkhardt's head office, an aide said no snub of the mayor was intended.

'There's been a misunderstanding on that issue,' said Cathy Aldana.

'Our people have been in contact with the mayor's office daily, and I know Mr Burkhardt wanted to see her personally.' 

Investigators are also looking at a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster.

A fire official has said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled.

In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed.

The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99.

The crash has raised questions about the rapidly growing use of rail to transport oil in North America, especially in the booming North Dakota oil fields and Alberta oil sands far from the sea.

Shell-shocked residents of Lac-Megantic in Quebec took a small step toward normalcy on Friday after homes and businesses reopened just yards away from the lakeside town's devastated centre.

Police erected an 8-foot (2.5-meter) fence blocking from view what was once a downtown core of restaurants, bars and shops - but which now resembles a blackened warzone after a train pulling 72 cars of crude oil jumped the track and exploded into flames there on July 6.

Bells from the town's main church, whose spire towers over the treetops in this normally quiet town in Quebec's eastern hills, could be heard ringing out for the first time since the incident as residents prepared to bring in mementos of the dead for a memorial.

'It is good to be home, even if we're near a disaster area,' said Andre Gabouri, 47, as he stood on his doorstep peering over the police barricade across the street and into the warped pile of train cars.

In a testament to the intensity of the blast, which killed an estimated 50 people in Canada's worst train incident in years, the vinyl siding of nearby houses was curled outward and the leaves in the trees blackened.
