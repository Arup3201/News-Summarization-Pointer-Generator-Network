A private document, revealing Gatwick's plans to campaign against expansion at Heathrow airport, embarrassingly backfired after papers outlining the strategy were reportedly left on a train.

Secret plans from Gatwick Airport were revealed to lobby 'gold, silver and bronze' opinion formers against the expansion of the rival airport's third runway.

Gatwick proposed to target influential people such as politicians, civil servants, business leaders and environmentalists in order to gain influence on the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies.

The document, seen by The Sunday Times, revealed the operation being fought by Britain's second-biggest airport as it tries to convince the government-appointed commission that it should be allowed to expand.

In addition to persuading the opinion formers to speak in favour of a second runway at Gatwick, the strategy also aims to 'neutralise the prevailing default bias that we perceive exists in favour of Heathrow.'

Further reading revealed Gatwick's bosses also instigated a noise study which undermines claims made by Heathrow that less people would suffer from aircraft noise if it were given the green light to build a third runway.

Heathrow previously stated the number of people 'significantly annoyed' by aircraft noise would reduce from 237,350 to between 187,000 and 202,900, even with an additional runway, as a result of steeper landing approaches and quieter aircraft.  

Gatwick, however, labelled these figures as 'disingenuous' and commissioned the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to model the noise impact of its west London competitor.

Gatwick's dossier stated that once the Heathrow runway was at its full capacity the number of people affected by the noise would actually increase by 20,650 to 258,000.

Heathrow insisted that its noise figures were also based on CAA modelling and accused Gatwick of failing to publish all the technical documents related to its own expansion plans.

The document, that was found on the train, was reportedly discussed by Gatwick bosses last month and questions when to submit its findings to Sir Howard Davies and the commission.
