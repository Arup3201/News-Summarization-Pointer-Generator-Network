The Dog and Duck might be a common name for a pub, but it's rare to see the two animals getting on as well as the pair in these heartwarming pictures.

Skip the terrier and Fifty Pence the mallard have formed an unlikely friendship since they were brought together at a centre for wounded animals.

Fifty Pence can often be seen playing with Skip's tennis ball, and the pair even snuggle up together when they sleep.

Best friends: Skip the terrier and Fifty Pence the mallard have formed an unlikely relationship

Canoodle: The pair were brought together at a centre for wounded animals in Yorkshire

They were introduced to each other two months ago by Annette Pyrah, of Barlby, North Yorkshire, who runs the Selby Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre.

Ms Pyrah, 49, said: 'Someone brought in the duck when she was just a day old.

'They had found her in nearby woods where a fox was circling her, so she’s had a very lucky escape.

'When you’re only the size of a fifty pence piece, alone in the forest, cold, frightened and with a hungry fox circling, the outlook was bleak.

'At first I kept her in a little pen under a feather duster, which replicated her mum.

Buddies: Fifty Pence and Skip have become almost inseparable after the mallard was brought to the centre when only a day old

'The dogs sat and gazed at her all day. They’re used to having lots of animals around and they’re very well trained.

'Once I let her out she started following the dogs around. She thinks she is a dog.'

Ms Pyrah said that Fifty Pence is allowed to roam about the garden and spends most of the day following Skip.

'She tries to play football with her,' Ms Pyrah added, 'running after the ball and pecking at her but isn’t able to pick it up with her beak.

'She’s constantly pecking at Skip, trying to groom and preen her ears.

'Skip doesn’t mind, they play together quite happily although Fifty Pence sometimes annoys her with the pecking.

'She’s even taken up residence in the dog’s pet bed.

'She sleeps with the dog in the conservatory and, when the dogs are in their bed in the living room, Fifty Pence pecks on the patio door from outside, wanting to be let in.

'She seems to have fallen in love with Skip.'

Ms Pyrah said the duck was now fully grown and would soon be able to fly.

And while the bird's relationship with Skip might be funny, Ms Pyrah is keen to introduce her to other ducks in her pond.

Ms Pyrah said: 'There are wild ducks who come to my duck pond so I’m hoping Fifty Pence will find a boyfriend there and have some ducklings of her own.

'But when it comes to that, the dogs and I will be sad to see her go.'
