A 15-year-old girl who was caught on camera for allegedly attacking a former school friend in a park has broken her silence and revealed she is 'not sorry' for what she had done.

The shocking video shows the girl dragging a 16-year-old by the hair as she bashes her before a final kick to her face in a suburban park in Cranebrook, which is 60km west of Sydney's central business district last Saturday afternoon.

'I'm sorry for - I don't regret what I done but I'm sorry for the way I done it,' she told Nine News. 

'I didn't mean to hurt her the way I did, and all that stuff.'

Swift and vicious: This is the final, terrifying moment of the assault in which a 15-year-old schoolgirl brutally kicks in the face a girl, 16, from the same school in a beating which took place in a suburban park last Saturday in the far western Sydney suburb of Cranebrook

During the attack, filmed on a phone by a third girl who sings and laughs during the assault, the victim apparently anticipates the violence and repeatedly asks for someone to take her phone.

'Can't you just take no for an answer. I am not fighting you right now,' the victim said in the video.

'No I am not getting away from the baby because I'm not fighting you.

'I have never had a fight in my life.' before another intervenes and says: 'Well it's time to experience them.'

Headed for trouble: The 16-year-old girl (pictured wearing a dress) heads through the trees in the Cranebrook park followed by her assailant wearing a dark blue hoodie and lighter blue jeans moments before the confrontation

Suburban mayhem: The alleged bashing happened in daylight amid a stand of gum trees in a suburban park in Cranebrook (map, above), near Penrith in far western Sydney

About to happen: It''s seconds before the assault begins and the girl, 16, anticipating that it's about to get nasty pleads with someone to take her phone from her

The victim is seen pushing an infant on a swing before she tries to walk away from the bullies but they follow and surround her.

The pair clash, the victim holding up both hands in a defensive manner, then the 15-year-old assailant knees her and pulls her down by her long blonde hair and kicks her.

While the victim is lying on the ground, the younger girls delivers a direct and brutal kick in the face, and the victim emits a whimper.

The girl filming the attack laughs as the victims remains on the ground. 

Hands off: The 16-year-old holds up he hands as the younger girl marches in for the attack. The video is being filmed by a girl who is singing and then laughing her way through, while others watch on in 

During the alleged attack, the girl, dressed in jeans and a top, attacks the 16-year-old girl among a stand of gum trees in the park near Penrith, in far western Sydney, Ray Hadley reports in an interview and an exclusive video to Radio 2GB. 

The victim's aunt, Tanya, told Ray Hadley her niece went to the same school as the 15-year-old. 

The girl who filmed the attack uploaded the video onto Facebook, after which the victim's family reported the incident to police. 

Police from Penrith Local Area Command have interviewed the girl and charged her with Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm. 

The teenager, from Bidwill, has been placed on strict bail conditions and will appear in the NSW Children's Court next month.

Still upright: the pair wrestle for a few seconds, before it becomes terribly clear that the girl in blue is stronger

Losing battle: the slightly older girl is now clearly at the mercy of the girl, 15, who has her by the hair

Down she goes: The victim is kneed and punched to the ground by the 15-year-old assailant, who then grabs the girls long blonde hair and yanks on it as the girl is pushed down

Grounded: Helpless and hurting the 16-year-old has already been kicked once in this image, but the assailant takes a few steps back before she runs in to deliver the final blow

Schoolgirl beating: the weekend assault on the teenage girl occurred on October 11 in Cranebrook, whihc lies near the foothills of the Blue Mountains 60km west of Sydney's central business district

In pain: Whimpering from the vicious kick that has just been delivered to her face, the poor young teenager lies on the grass as the girl filming the appalling episode laughs
