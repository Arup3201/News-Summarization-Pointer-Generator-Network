Michael Carrick has given Manchester United a big lift ahead of their clash with arch-rivals Liverpool by signing a new one-year contract at Old Trafford.

The England midfielder has emerged as a key figure under Louis van Gaal despite missing the first two-and-half months of the season with an ankle injury sustained in the Dutchman’s first training session last summer.

Van Gaal has made Carrick his vice-captain and the midfielder’s impressive displays culminated in him creating the opening goal for Marouane Fellaini in last weekend’s 3-0 win at home to Tottenham before scoring himself with a rare headed effort

The 33-year-old, who joined United from Spurs for £18.6million in 2006, was due to be out of contract in the summer but the club have exercised an option to extend it for another 12 months.

Speaking at his weekly press conference ahead of Sunday’s trip to Anfield, Van Gaal said: ‘He is important. He can read the game as a player on the pitch so he can coach during the game but he can improve that, I think.

‘And he is also a midfielder who can play the ball forwards and that I like because our aim is always passing the ball more forwards than sideways or backwards.

Carrick has won five Premier League titles with Manchester United as well as the Champions League

‘And he is my second (vice) captain, he is an important man for my selection.

‘Wayne Rooney is my first captain and Michael Carrick is my second captain and that say enough what I think about those players.

‘Wayne Rooney is Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick is Michael Carrick. These are different people.’
