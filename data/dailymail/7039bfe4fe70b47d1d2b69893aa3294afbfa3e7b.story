 A Buffalo Bills player says an opposing fan shining a laser pointer in his eyes caused the kicker to miss a field goal Sunday in the game against the Detroit Lions. 

Video from the game clearly shows a green light on Colton Schmidt's face as placekicker Dan Carpenter attempts a 50-yard field goal. The kick went wild and didn't even come close to the uprights. 

Earlier in the game, quarterback Kyle Orton complained to refs after he, too, was blasted in the eyes by a green laser before a missed pass attempt at Ford Field in Detroit.

The Bills filed a formal complaint with the NFL and the league said it is investigating the incident. 

Orton was left fuming after the game, saying he was nailed by the laser at least twice.  

A fan named Marko Beslach bragged on Twitter that he was responsible for the laser light and league officials say he could be banned from NFL stadiums if is proven he is responsible.

'Got Kyle Orton complained to the ref when I got him with the laser,' Beslach tweeted Sunday.

He has since deleted his entire Twitter account.

The Twitter user has been targeted by Bills fans, who started a Facebook group calling from him to be banned the by NFL

Laser pointers are banned in NFL stadiums and are capable of causing permanent damage if they are shined directly in the eyes. 

Small, powerful laser pointers are widely available for less than $50 and can focus a beam of light up to 300 yards away. 

Despite the interference, the Bills managed to power their way through the game and win.

Carpenter got sweet revenge when he kicked a 58-yard field goal to win the game, 17-14.
