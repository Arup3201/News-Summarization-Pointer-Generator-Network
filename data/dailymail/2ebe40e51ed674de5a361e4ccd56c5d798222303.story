Incompetent: Brent Bartel, 40, has been deemed unfit to stand trial for carving a pentagram into his son's back

A Texas father charged with carving a pentagram into his six-year-old son's back has been ordered to a psychiatric hospital after being found incompetent to stand trial.

Brent Bartel, 40, is accused of using a box cutter to carve a pentagram into his son's back in December 2012.

Doctors have diagnosed Bartel as paranoid schizophrenic, and a judge has ordered him to spend at least one year in treatment at Kerrville State Hospital.

According to the Star-Telegram, Bartel has been found incompetent by doctors twice previously since his arrest.

In November after he was found incompetent, he was sent to the North Texas State Hospital in Vernon for treatment.

The Star-Telegram reports that Bartel made several bizarre statements to doctors as he was evaluated this month, and was unable to speak about his case without incorporating religious ideas and delusions.

'There’s a lot of spiritual warefare going on'; 'I was hearing voices coming through the television, back when I was on block 56'; 'When I leave here, I’ll fast and eat only rabbit pellets for 40 days'; 'Devil makes sounds that don’t bounce'; 'Got a hernia due to my computer'; and 'Electromagnetic pulse can detonate people' are some of the remarks he made to doctors.

Disturbing: Officers said the father took some of his son's blood and smeared it on the door frame

Unsettling scene: The six-year-was was found shivering outside his home dressed only in pajama pants and no shirt

Chilling: Bartel, pictured here with his young son, told a 911 dispatcher that he 'shed some innocent blood' in honor of the 'holy day,' likely referring to the historic date 12-12-12

On February 11, he said, 'Dreams suggest not to live with my son.'

After Bartel attacked his son in 2012, he called emergency services to tell them he had done it because ‘it's a holy day.’ The date was 12-12-12, a once-in-a-century event without any discernible religious meaning.

Bartel could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Bartel called 911 shortly after midnight to report the incident, The Dallas Morning Star reported.

'I shed some innocent blood,' he calmly told the emergency services. 'I inscribed a pentagram on my son.'

Shortly
 after Bartel confessed, the boy's mother ran to a neighbor's house and 
also called 911 to report that her husband was hurting their son and was
 armed with a knife.

Medical help: Bartel will receive treatment at Kerrville State Hospital

Officers
 who responded to the two calls arrived to discover the boy shivering in
 the front yard dressed in pajama pants without a shirt.

Most
 of the child's back was covered with a large pentagram. Officers 
wrapped the six-year-old with a jacket and called the paramedics.

Inside Bartel's house police recovered a box cutter they believe was the weapon used to carve the symbol.

A pentagram is a five-pointed star inside a circle that is most commonly associated with the occult, including Neopagan faiths and Freemasonry, as well as satanism.

In a bizarre twist, Sergeant Nathan Stringer, of Richland Hills police, said that Bartel smeared some of his son's blood on the frame of his front door, according to CBS DFW.

'This is something you normally hear about in the movies, not something you expect to see,' Stringer told the station KENS5.

The cuts to his back were not very deep, and the boy did not have to have stitches.

According to police, they had responded to Bartel's home in the past over verbal domestic abuse, but they said that none of the previous incidents involved the child.
