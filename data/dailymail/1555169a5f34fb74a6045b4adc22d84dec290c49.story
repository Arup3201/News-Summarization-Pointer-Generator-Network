An Australian jihadist widow has shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen.

In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress.

In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?'

Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.'

A Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5, which they said originated in France

In another image, the women are pictured posing in head-to-toe black dress under an Islamic State flag

Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he '

Vile caption: The former Melbourne woman sprayed a series of hateful messages on social media on 

Vanished: Zehra Duman, pictured, left behind a distraught family when she fled for the Middle East late in 2014. She later posted that she had married jihadist fighter Mahmoud Abdullatif, married 

Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. 

It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'.

Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 

'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr.

The identities of the jihadist women in Ms Duman's pictures are unclear. 

However, the BMW bears resemblance to the same vehicle Australian jihadist and former underworld figure Mohammed Elomar was pictured smirking and wielding a Glock next to in September 2014.

Defensive: Zehra Duman justified boasting about her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - but was then forced to defend the posts, telling her followers to 'chill n stop jujjing'

Shortly after boasting about the expensive vehicle, Duman became defensive on social media and said 'no one is trying to be flashy'

'The m5 was driven here from france (sic) and is meant to be sold here. Chill n stop (judging). No one is trying to be flashy in sham (Syria).'  

Duman fled Australia late last year, leaving behind a distraught family, who told reporters she had been 'brainwashed'. 

The tweets, pictured here, have since been deleted

The Herald Sun quoted her father, Duvat Duman, saying: 'She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago.' 

Khaled Sharrouf's wife Tara Nettleton is among the Australian females who have joined the Islamic State.

Australian teenager Jake Bilardi was reported dead in a suicide bombing in Ramadi, Iraq, last week.
