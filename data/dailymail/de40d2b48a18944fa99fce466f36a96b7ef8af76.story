It had to end sometime and sadly, the record-breaking autumn heatwave is expected to finish abruptly today, with temperatures plummeting and strong winds ripping across northern regions.

The mercury has already begun to drop across the UK and the weather will become even cooler and more unsettled as the week progresses, say forecasters.

Yesterday Britain basked in temperatures as high as 28C - recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire - but by the end of the week it will be down to 14C - a normal autumn day.

And meteorologists warn that it is time to put away the sun cream as we're not going to see the sort of sunshine we've experienced in the past week again until next year.

The change in weather conditions has already reached the west coast of Scotland which has been hit by wind and rain.

The end of the heatwave and this week's cooler weather will lead to an explosion across the UK of wild mushrooms.

Experts are predicting a bumper crop because of the combination of the hot, dry spring, the cool, damp summer, the unexpected early autumn heat, and the coming rain.

They have created ideal conditions and mushroom hunters are expected to descend on meadows and commons across the country.

In Surrey's Mole Valley, fungi expert Ray Tantram is leading expeditions looking for edible mushrooms but she warned that 'beginners should beware' of poisonous varieties.

Those conditions could escalate as Hurricane Ophelia heads across the Atlantic and towards the British Isles.

The tail-end of the hurricane - currently affecting North America - is due to hit Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England by mid-week.

Today the weather is likely to be comfortable but tomorrow rain will cover much of Scotland and Northern Ireland before moving south across the rest of the UK.

Billy Payne, a forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, said: 'It is looking cooler and more unsettled from today 
with a lot of cloud over southern England and and a few spots of rain 
especially in the west.

'The north will have some blustery showers and it will be quite windy with local gales in the northern isles.

Temperatures in some places will drop by as much as 10C, but London could still see highs of 20C.'

Much of the UK will see showers by Thursday, with longer spells of rain, continuing strong winds and some thunderstorms across western Scotland and north-west England.

Parts of Scotland could even be hit by frost, with temperatures of just 3C or 4C expected on Friday night.

Mr Payne added: 'It is now very unlikely that we will see the temperatures we have had over the past week until early summer next year.'

The UK's hottest day of 2011 was June 27 when a temperature of 33.3C was recorded at the Olympic Park in London.

Despite the unseasonal sunshine, trees have begun to change colour and South West Trains has said it will operate a 'leaf fall' timetable until December 10 on some routes.

Some services will depart a few minutes early, meaning they have a longer journey to take account of problems the train might encounter.

Leaves on the rails are crushed by passing trains, forming a slippery film which makes it harder for trains to accelerate away from stations and meaning drivers have to approach station stops more slowly than normal.

Network Rail runs special rail-cleaning trains but these can only reduce and not completely eliminate the problem, South West Trains said on its website.

Despite the appearance that the UK will be bathed in sunshine on Saturday, temperatures will struggle to reach 14C
