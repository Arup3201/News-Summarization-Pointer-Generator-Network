The owner of an American Bulldog which mauled his 18 month old niece to death was found guilty of being in charge of another dangerously out of control dog despite having a five-year ban from keeping the animals as pets.

Urfan Ahmed, 35, of Crawley, West Sussex, was found guilty this week of walking his girlfriend's dog when it attacked another animal in a park.

It was the second time he had flouted the ban imposed by the courts - despite one of his dogs killing his brother's daughter three years ago.

Toddler Zumer Ahmed died in a horrific attack in April 2010, when her uncle's dog was said by eye-witnesses to be 'eating her head' in the kitchen of the family's home.

The girl's father, Nazir Ahmed, aged 39 years, spoke out at the time and said he didn't blame his brother for her death.

Ahmed was arrested but not charged. However, his American Bulldog dog was destroyed after the tragedy at the family's home.

When police investigated the attack, it emerged he also owned a Dogo Argentino - an illegal breed - and he was banned from owning dogs for five years in 2011.

But callous Ahmed has continued to keep the pets despite the court ban.

Magistrates heard he was walking his partner Linda Hood's pet dog, Fila, in a park in Pease Pottage, West Sussex,when it attacked another dog on July 11, last year.

JPs in Horsham, West Sussex, warned the 35-year-old this was his 'last chance' to avoid prison. He was further banned from owning a dog until 2023 and fined £1,200.

He was also ordered to pay £775 court costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Hood, aged 46 years, of Clark Road, Crawley, West Sussex, received a 24-month conditional discharge and was also ordered to pay £775 costs.

Speaking after the case, Inspector Di Lewis from Sussex Police said: 'My officers have worked tirelessly for the last year and a half to bring Ahmed to the courts and secure this banning order to protect the public.

'We are pleased with this result as it shows we will not tolerate people not being able to control their dogs and will not let anyone get away with breaching a banning order for owning dogs.

'The magistrate told Ahmed during the trial that if he comes before the courts again for keeping dogs, he will be sent to prison.'
