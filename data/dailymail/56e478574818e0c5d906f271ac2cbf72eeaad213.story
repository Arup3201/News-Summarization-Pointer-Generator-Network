Mohamed Hassan, 55, is a world-renowned award-winning consultant working in a government hospital in Abu Dhabi. His son discovered the bomb

This is the American doctor whose family's quick thinking foiled a bomb plot - and helped police catch the Reem Island Ghost suspected of murdering a teacher in a shopping mall.

Mohamed Hassan is a world-renowned award-winning consultant working in a government hospital in Abu Dhabi.

The 55-year-old Egyptian doctor studied in the US, where he worked and won numerous accolades over more than a decade, including the title of physician of the year from the Pennsylvania Advisory Board in 2003.

He is a paediatric nephrologist working with young kidney transplant patients.

It was Dr Hassan's 13-year-old son who spotted the makeshift bomb, packed with nails to create maximum havoc, on the doorstep of their beachfront apartment in the United Arab Emirates capital.

He saw the object on their doormat as he was going to the mosque to pray and told his mother. She alerted police, who quickly dismantled the bomb before it could explode.

Within 48 hours, officers had arrested Dalal al Hashemi, a 38-year-old Emirati of Yemeni origin, at her home in Abu Dhabi, where they discovered bomb-making equipment. 

There were fears she was not acting alone, although police have refused to be drawn on how many others might have been involved.

Security officials said the two victims - American teacher Ibolya Ryan, 47, and the Arab-American doctor - had been targeted because of their nationality.

Al Hashemi was said to have given a full confession and is now facing the death penalty if she is convicted of a terrorist act.

Father-of-three Dr Hassan, a consultant nephrologist at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City and an expert in kidney diseases, told the government-run Emirates News Agency the bomb attempt and murder, thought to have been committed by the same burqa-clad female suspect, amounted to 'a cowardly crime that is alien to the good UAE society whose government is keen to show the highest generosity and hospitality.

'This crime is an aggression against innocent people whose only fault is that they are western nationals.'

He said it was only thanks to his family's swift actions and those of the police that more injuries were not caused among his family and 'anyone who might have been in the vicinity where the bomb was planted, including children, other residents, cleaners, guards, delivery men and other innocent people'.

Attack: In footage that was released earlier this week, the suspect can be seen entering the mall at 1.13pm

On the move: In other newly-released footage, the suspect is seen dragging a small suitcase towards where an Egyptian-American doctor lives. She is accused of leaving a home-made bomb outside his door

Dr Hassan said his wife called him after their son discovered the bomb. The family were evacuated and rehomed in a hotel apartment.

It is not known how the attacker knew Dr Hassan's nationality. She allegedly stabbed Mrs Ryan in public toilets in Boutik Mall on Reem island on Monday - then drove 30 minutes to Dr Hassan's beachfront apartment block.

A security guard became suspicious after seeing a veiled woman wearing gloves wheeling a small black suitcase into the building, then leaving several minutes later.

A similarly-dressed woman had visited the apartment several days earlier - but once she had checked to see if the Hassans were home, she fled before they had a chance to identify her.

Dr Hassan said he had been called personally by Sheikh Saif Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the deputy prime minister of the UAE and the Interior Minister in charge of security. The prince assured him the offender would be brought to justice.

Dr Hassan said: 'The phone call provided great relief during that critical ordeal. It reflects the noble and civilised approach of the leaders and the government's work to consolidate the security and stability of the UAE.'

The doctor has been working in Abu Dhabi since 2006.

Mom: Teacher Ibolya Ryan, 47,  was the mother of 11-year-old twin boys. She was previously married and lived with her then-husband, Paul, in Denver, Colorado. She was killed in Boutik Mall on Reem island

Victim: Mrs Ryan, 47, a teacher, said in online profiles that she was born in Hungary and raised in Romania

He studied medicine at Alexandria University in Egypt before completing his postgraduate studies in the US.

He practiced and taught in the US for more than a decade. He was an assistant professor of medicine in Pennsylvania State University and was awarded the Ronald M Franz trophy for high academic achievements in 1996.

He won physician of the year seven years later. Dr Hassan is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and of the American Society of Nephrology and is a reviewer for the American Board of Internal Medicine.

He has published numerous papers on diabetes and nephropathy and is an expert in acute and chronic kidney failure and kidney transplant evaluation.

Dr Hassan is a paediatric nephrologist treating young kidney transplant patients. He did his postgraduate studies in Capital Health System in New Jersey and was a fellow in nephrology in Thomas Jefferson University, Pennsylvania.
