A politically emboldened President Obama used his State of the Union address on Tuesday to call for greater firearm controls in an emotional tribute to victims of gun violence.

'I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence,' Obama said toward the end of a broad-ranging speech that lasted just over an hour. 'But this time is different.'

Referring to the December elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, he said, 'In the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.'

violence,' Obama said. 'They deserve a vote [on gun control].'

'The families of Newtown deserve a vote.'

Obama
recently called on Congress to pass three major legislative proposals 
tightening gun controls, one of which would require background checks 
for all gun buyers, not only for those buying from federally licensed 
dealers, as is now the law.

His other major proposals would ban semiautomatic weapons as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines.

'Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country,' he said. 'Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlined tonight.'

'But we were never sent here to be perfect,' he continued. 'We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.
