Peter Scudamore’s position as Premier League chief executive took a severe blow after sexist emails sent from his account were described as ‘unacceptable’ by Prime Minister David Cameron.

Scudamore has been under fire for the past week following the publication of sexist emails sent from his Premier League account.

The Premier League was on Sunday forced to defend its working environment after the woman who blew the whistle on Scudamore said she was 'humiliated, belittled and disgusted' when reading the messages.

Expressing his view: Prime Minister David Cameron has described sexist emails sent by Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore as 'unacceptable'

A Downing 
Street spokesman said Prime Minister David Cameron shared the view 
expressed by sports minister Helen Grant that Scudamore's comments were 
‘unacceptable’ but that it was for the Premier League to decide on his 
future.

The
 Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'Helen Grant ... was right to
 say what she did, I have clearly associated the Prime Minister directly
 with those remarks.

'But in terms of staffing decisions at the Premier League, it's for the Premier League.'

A
 Premier League statement said: 'We do not recognise this 
characterisation of the working environment at the Premier League, nor 
do we believe that it can be supported by the facts.

'The
 chief executive has already apologised for any offence caused and a 
proper review of all the evidence is now under way within the Premier 
League's established and rigorous procedures.

'This
 process is not yet concluded and it is therefore not possible to offer 
comments in detail at this stage. However we will make a further 
statement in due course.

'The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.'

The emails referred to women in a derogatory terms, contained sexual innuendos, and made jokes about 'female irrationality'.

The
 Football Association's independent board member Heather Rabbatts, who 
will chair a meeting of its inclusion advisory board to discuss the case
 on Tuesday, has also issued a statement saying Scudamore should 
consider his position in light of 'growing evidence of a closed culture 
of sexism' at the Premier League.

Abraham said she felt she had a duty to speak out about the contents of emails between her boss and his lawyer friend.

'Mr Scudamore has a huge amount of influence and is paid a vast sum of money and has behaved wrongly,' she said.

'Having
 witnessed that I felt I had a duty to speak out. If I didn't then I'd 
somehow be condoning his behaviour - just like the other people who saw 
those messages.

Pressure: Heather Rabbatts believes Scudamore should consider his position at the Premier League

'Despite
 what some people have said since the Sunday Mirror printed the story 
last week, this is not the sort of thing that goes on in offices these 
days.

'And
 for those people who've attacked me for saying they were just 'jokes' I
 wonder how they would feel if their wife or girlfriend or daughter had 
to read messages like that.

'And how would they feel if those messages were written about their wife or girlfriend or daughter?'

'We've heard of casual racism and I think there's a lot of casual sexism in the game.'

 Barclays has expressed also its disappointment to the league, which has
 raised the stakes ahead of Monday's meeting of the league's audit and 
remuneration committee, chaired by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck.

Buck
 is a friend and shooting partner of Scudamore's, but the committee only
 has the power to make a recommendation and consists of four members, 
the others being Manchester United director David Gill, Stoke chairman 
Peter Coates and Premier League referees' chairman John Williams.
