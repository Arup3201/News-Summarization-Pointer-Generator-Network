While fans around the world were glued to their screens to watch the Champions League final – not to mention 65,000 packed into the Estadio do Luz, I had a day with a difference.

I flew out to Ibiza to the Heineken Star Final, and watched the game with Real Madrid hero Fernando Morientes and former Atletico star Luis Garcia.

Legends on either side of the Madrid divide, the two former Champions League-winners were bound to have different takes on the Lisbon showpiece.

After appearing the night before at a beach dinner for hundreds of competition winners, Garcia and Morientes showed off their skills by shooting into a floating goal in the Mediterranean, aided by some truly impressive jetskiing skills.

After proving that I’m better off writing about football than playing it with a spot of beach soccer, I caught up with the two stars to gauge their nerves before the game.

Morientes was predictably hell-bent on Real securing the famous ‘La Decima’ – their tenth European Cup – while Garcia was quietly confident Atletico could do the double over their illustrious neighbours by following up winning La Liga in spectacular fashion and winning the Champions League.

Former striker Morientes left you under no illusion who he thought the bigger team was, saying: 'La Decima is not life or death, but it's the most important thing for the club, the city and the supporters.

'It's the biggest competition in Europe and Real Madrid are the most important club in the world, so it's a necessity.

'Ancelotti 
will play the same way he has done all season. A team like Real Madrid 
doesn't have to change their strategy because of the opposition.’

Garcia,
 meanwhile, was a little less bullish, but believed the pressure was all
 on Carlo Ancelotti’s side, while revealing he would love to know 
Atletico boss Diego Simeone’s secret formula.

'I would like to be inside the dressing room to know how he's handled everything,’ he said.

‘It's been very difficult fighting against Real and Barcelona and Atletico was always there. He's done an amazing job.

'Man to man Real Madrid is stronger, but that's not the most important thing in a final. Everyone knows how important the 10th European cup is to Real Madrid so Atletico know if they win they can be at the top for a few years.'

After a healthy dose of after-sun in the hotel, I went to the cinema-style open-air viewing for the match, where excitement to watch the final was already reaching fever pitch.

Morientes and Garcia smiled and waved on stage to the audience, before settling in to their main task for the evening – answering fans’ questions on Twitter throughout the match, including some from Sportsmail.

I spoke to both of the players before, during and after the game, with one much happier as time progressed than his counterpart.

Throughout the ninety minutes Morientes looked glum, in stark comparision to his fellow ex-Kopite Garcia – sure of seeing his former side complete the ultimate double over their arch nemesis.

That all changed with Sergio Ramos’ goal deep into added time. Morientes jumped up, knowing that Ancelotti’s side had grasped the chance of a glorious win from the jaws defeat.

Extra-time was horrifically cruel to Atletico, who had been superb throughout normal time. Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo put the score at a truly unfair 4-1.

With Morientes still celebrating, I managed to grab a few words with the despondent Garcia.

He said: ‘Atletico did a great job, but because they made a mistake they got punished – that’s what Real Madrid do. In the end it was a bit unfair, but that’s football.

‘Atletico deserved to win. They played the same as they have done all season, keeping Real away from the goal, and it worked for 90 minutes – but you can’t make those mistakes.

‘Simeone has to be immensely proud of the whole season.’

While Garcia contemplated the loss and Morientes grinned away watching his club finally lifting ‘La Decima’, I was whisked off to the neighbouring Usuhaia opening party. Tough job.
