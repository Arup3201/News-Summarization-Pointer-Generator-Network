A computer game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused fury and deep upset to families of the victims and survivors of the massacre.

The simulation game allows players to re-enact the terrible day of the shooting on December 14 last year where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut.

The game, which has already been taken down by one website where it was posted, allows users to 'shoot mother', collect ammunition and move through the school firing weapons.

A video game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused pain and outrage among families of victims and survivors

Family of teacher Victoria Soto, who was shot dead protecting her students, tweeted at the creator of the game and questioned his motives for creating it, according to courant.com.

An official Twitter account linked to Miss Soto's memorial page reached out to game creator Ryan Jake Lambourn on Monday.

'Please tell us how playing a game that recreates how Vicki died would be beneficial? Please tell us,' the family's tweet read.

Lambourn, who claims to be based in Sydney, Australia, replied: 'sure, but you'd learn more by "playing it".'

The Soto family later released this statement: 'The constant barrage of negative backlash we face as a family is unimaginable. We constantly have to battle people who still to this day, think Sandy Hook is a hoax. For those people I can only say I hope you never have to go through what we do as a family.

'On top of all that, today as we are trying to summon up the courage and composure to face the 1 year anniversary, we learned about a video game that was made called "The Slaying of Sandy Hook', the title alone, was painful. Through conversation with the maker of the game on twitter, we have learned he intended it to be a video game addressing the gun control debate. But why? We do not understand why anyone would do this? Perhaps someone else knows the answer.

'We do not encourage this game, nor do we condone it. We only bring attention to it so that we can perhaps reach the maker and make him understand why his message was delivered in the most inappropriate way. We cannot understand why anyone would think what happened at Sandy Hook is something that can or should be made into a "game". This is real life to us. Every day.'

Lambourn defended the game on Twitter saying he created it to highlight the importance of gun control.
