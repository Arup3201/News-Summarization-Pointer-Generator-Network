Smiling and waving, Ebola victim Sontay Massaley leaves a treatment centre in Liberia after being given the all-clear for the disease.

The mother-of-three, a vendor at an outdoor market, was given little chance of survival when she had arrived at the medical centre eight days ago, but has now been allowed to return to her family in Paynesville.

Ebola kills around 70 per cent of those who become infected, and yesterday the World Heath Organisation announced that the death toll in west Africa has passed 4,000, so Sontay knows she is one of the lucky few.

Liberia's crumbling health service is already struggling to cope with the flood of Ebola cases, and with health workers set to walk out at midnight tomorrow in a strike over pay and conditions, cases like Sontay's could become even rarer.

Going home: Sontay Massaley, a mother-of-three from Liberia, leaves an Ebola treatment centre after being given the all-clear

Lucky: She was given little chance of survival when she arrived at the centre eight days ago as Ebola kills 70 per cent of those infected

Losing battle: However cases like Sontay's could become even rarer as Liberian health workers threaten to walk from tomorrow night demanding better pay and conditions, and more safety equipment

Nurses and doctors working in Ebola treatment centres say they are not being provided with enough safety gear, and are demanding better pay and working conditions.

Talks with the government today ended with officials refusing to meet the workers' demands, and if nothing changes by midnight tomorrow, then hundreds of patients could be left without care.

'The government of Liberia has not changed their posture. They do not want to engage us so that we can talk,' Williams said. 'Time is running out, by 1200 midnight on Monday morning, we will be starting the go-slow action.'

Liberia's deputy health minister Matthew Flomo said the government was not aware of health workers planning to strike.

'What I do know is that the government has reached an agreement with health workers for their payment, which will be as of September, beginning Monday,' Flomo said.

But Williams denied the workers had reached any agreement with the government. He accused the administration of trying to divide the workers. 

Deadly: More than 2,000 people have already died in Liberia, among them 95 health workers. If medical centre staff do walk out tomorrow, it will potentially leave thousands of Ebola patients without care

Happy: Sontay poses with a photographer at the medical centre. The mother-of-three, a market vendor, will now be allowed to go home

'The problem is the government. The public should get angry with the government, not with us,' Williams said

'The public is aware that health workers are dying because they are not protected. Nobody is supposed to die while protecting lives, we have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so,' he said.

Liberia has the highest number of infections and deaths of the worst outbreak of the viral haemorrhagic fever that has killed 2,316 people in the poor West African nation.

A lack of education among the population, and denial about the spread of Ebola, often leads to populations in slums turning against Ebola teams sent to retrieve dead bodies, or treat Ebola patients, as people falsely believe it is the doctors who are bringing the disease in.

Healthcare systems in Liberia as well as in Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the outbreak was first recorded in March, have been overwhelmed by the epidemic. The disease has also spread to Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.

Celebration: Staff at a medical centre cheer as patients who are now free of Ebola are checked before leaving. But a threatened walk-out by some workers tomorrow threatens to spread the disease even further

Concern that Ebola could spread globally has prompted international organisations and the international community to step up support for the affected countries with medical personnel, material and pledges of about $1billion to tackle the epidemic.

But healthcare workers in Liberia complain they are still working without basic protective clothing and are not receiving adequate compensation while many of them have contracted and died from the disease.

Over 4,000 people have died from Ebola including 233 health care workers, among them 95 from Liberia and the same number from Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization.
