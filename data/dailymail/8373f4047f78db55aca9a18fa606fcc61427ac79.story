A hotel in Berlin has opened a bar encouraging guests to match their cocktail with their favourite perfume.

Fragrances, which is based in The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Berlin, Germany, is the first bar in the world dedicated to the art of cocktails made in combination with famous scents.

Drinkers are invited to have a whiff of the bottles of Georgia Armani and Yves Saint Laurent then select the matching cocktail to be made up from the menu.

Other favourite fragrances that experimental drinkers can choose include L'Artisan Parfumeur, Annick Goutal and Guerlain, combined with high-quality spirits to create the unique smelly drinks.

Designed and implemented by mixologist and perfume expert Henning Heissen, the menu has drinks such as Signorina by Salvatore Ferragamo with Jasmine and Rose infused or Zacapa spiked Oud Royal by Armani.

Don't drink alcohol? There are also virgin smelly beverages including Messe de Minuit and Penhaligon's Orange Blossom.

The ingredients used to make the individual drinks will be displayed next to the visual menu of perfume bottles at the bar's entrance.

Customers can simply smell the various fragrances before picking their drink and the beverage will smell exactly like the corresponding scent.

Each drink is served in a unique way to reflect the perfume design, from glasses set in buckets and birdhouses to bottles.

Arnd Heissen, from The Ritz-Carlton Hotel, said: 'At Fragrances, we want our guests not only to enjoy their drinks, but to experience them.

A world class experience: Fragrances is the only bar on the planet with drinks that smell like certain perfumes

'In the choice of their favourite cocktails, our guests depend entirely on their senses. An experiment, which demands courage and curiosity on the part of the guests, but which at the same time can be unbelievably inspiring.

'Our new bar doesn't only appeal to the nose and palate, but also the eye, the ear and our natural play instinct.

'There is something to discover everywhere, and so we have also appropriated objects such as bird houses, a wooden shrine or a metre-long bamboo stick and transformed them into creative cocktail containers.'

Cheers big ears: There are certainly some surreal serving options at the new bar

The kitchen team at The Ritz Carlton, Berlin serves bar snacks to match the creative drinks at Fragrances.

Arnd Heissen added: '"Macaron Énorme" with vanilla and raspberries ideally matches the drink "Signorina", which was inspired by the fragrance of the same name by Salvatore Ferragamo.'

Sublimotion in Ibiza is the world's most expensive dining experience, costing £1250 per head and featuring levitating food, light shows and waitresses dressed as air stewardesses.
