Adam Tajul was jailed for three years and nine months for his role in the drugs ring 

Charlotte Church's former lover has been jailed for dealing drugs, making him the second in the singer's repertoire of ex-boyfriends to be put behind bars. 

Adam Tajul, who taught Ms Church 'how to kiss' when she was just 15, was jailed for three years and nine months for his role in a drug smuggling operation.

The 29-year-old from Cardiff previously revealed how he dated the Crazy Chick singer and claims to have taught her how to kiss after the pair met in a sandwich shop. 

He is the second of Ms Church's lovers to be put behind bars. Kyle Johnson was jailed for 12 years after police discovered a £10million heroin haul in his home in 2009. 

Tajul was at the 'heart of a conspiracy' to transport 12kg of cannabis from Bristol to the Welsh capital, Cardiff Crown Court heard. 

Officers investigating the operation for more than two years seized £43,000 in cash after raiding his home. 

He was sentenced alongside six gang members on September 12. 

Tajul previously told how he met Ms Church in their native Cardiff in 2001 at which point her classical singing had become known as 'the voice of an angel'.

'Charlotte was a nice girl when she met me. She was well spoken and posh but she wanted to make things happen,' he said. 

'At first she couldn't kiss at all. But once I taught her how to French kiss she soon caught on.

The singer went on to live with Kyle Johnson (left), who is serving a 10-year-sentence after police found £10million of heroin in his home before settling down with rugby star Gavin Henson before they too split in 2010

'She loved me hard. It was like I was God - she gave it everything.' 

After breaking up with the criminal around her 16th birthday, Ms Church moved in with Kyle Johnson. 

In 2009 and following their acrimonious split four years earlier, Johnson was jailed after going on the run from police after £10million worth of heroin was found at his home. 

 Ms Church has two children with rugby player Gavin Henson, from whom she separated in 2010.

 MailOnline has contacted the singer for her comment on Mr Tajul's claims.
