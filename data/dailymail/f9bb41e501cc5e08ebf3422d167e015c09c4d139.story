A sham double wedding collapsed when one of the bogus brides was unable to identify the man she was due to marry.

The registrar had become suspicious when he was asked to marry two Lithuanian women to two Indian men.

His initial fears were confirmed when the couples turned up at the register office and were unable to communicate with their betrothed.

Blushing brides: Lithuanian Oskana Alexsandraviciute, left, and Sandra Beleckaite, right, were both arrested at the register office when they didn't recognise their grooms or speak the same language as their betrothed 

Immigration officers were called and the whole wedding party was arrested, together with the organiser who had set them up.

Yesterday a court was told that Indian-born Manpreet Singh, 27, and Jasbir Singh, 21, had arranged to marry Lithuanian girls Oskana Alexsandraviciute, 27, and Sandra Beleckaite, 21 at Wrexham register office.

By marrying two European residents, the Indian men would have been allowed to remain in the UK.But superintendent registrar Ruth Cooke soon realised something was wrong.

As the couples waited for the ceremony, it became clear that neither bride nor groom spoke the same language and could not understand each other.

Tipped off by the register office, immigration officials swooped and asked one of the Lithuanian ‘brides’ to point out her husband-to-be.

When she identified the wrong man, the whole group was arrested on the spot.

Mold Crown Court was told that, in an interview, the two Lithuanian women said they had been in long-standing sexual relationships with the Indian men.

But when questioned later, the men told immigration officers they were chaste and had only kissed their wives-to-be on the cheek.

Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, said it was clear that neither bride could understand their grooms when they arrived at the register office. ‘The grooms had little or no contact with their prospective brides,’ he said.

Judge Nicolas Parry said it was a serious conspiracy aimed at cheating the immigration laws to ensure two men not entitled to remain in the UK could do so.

‘Those who enter into sham marriages to frustrate the country’s immigration controls must expect sentences that deter others,’  he said.

Manpreet Singh and Jasbir Singh were jailed for 12 months and 11 months respectively while their two ‘brides’, Alexsandraviciute and Beleckaite, all from Wolverhampton, were jailed for 304 days each – meaning they walked free due to time spent on remand.

Organiser Jaspal Sahota, 51, a respected community elder, was jailed for two years and two months while Lithuanian helpers Andres Stepanov, 28, and Antannas Beleckas, 27, received 16 months and 15 months respectively.

Paul Abraham, defending Sahota, denied his client had received up to £7,000 for organising the scam and said he had been used by others.

Dave Offside, from the UK Border Agency said: ‘The two grooms in this case saw sham marriage as a potential shortcut to a life in the UK, but they have ended up behind bars.

‘The brides were prepared to marry people they barely know in exchange for cash and the others involved also stood to gain financially.’

The Indian men will be deported when they have served their sentences.
