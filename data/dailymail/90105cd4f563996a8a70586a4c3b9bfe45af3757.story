A former senior courtier has claimed that bowing and curtsying for the Queen is 'not necessary' as Her Majesty is 'very relaxed' about it all.

Dickie Arbiter, who spent 12 years at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House as press secretary, also said in a new memoir that people do not even have to wait for the Queen to speak first when they meet her.

In the book, On Duty With the Queen, he said: 'What may have befitted the social mores of the 18th and 19th centuries wasn't necessarily right for modern times. 

'Bowing or curtsying when in the presence of a member of the Royal family? Not necessary. Not unless one chooses to.'

He went on to the tell the Daily Telegraph: 'There is this sort of myth that comes from the annals of time that says whenever a member of the Royal family went past you did a curtsy or bow. 

'But there is no hard and fast rule, and if you can’t do it or don’t feel comfortable doing it or don’t want to do it that’s fine, it doesn’t mean you hold the Queen in any less respect and you won’t be sent to the Tower.

'The Queen is very relaxed about it, she doesn’t make rules, she understands that some people feel comfortable doing this sort of thing and others don’t. 

'The whole thing about waiting for the Queen to speak first is also a myth.'

In any event, it seems that the bow or curtsy could lose out in popularity to the selfie.

The Queen posed for her first 'selfie' during a trip to Northern Ireland in the Summer - but has admitted she finds the phenomena of people filming her on their mobile phones rather strange.

On the official website of the British Monarchy it says there 'are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen' but that many people 'wish to observe tradition'. 

It explains that it is 'perfectly acceptable' to simply shake hands with Her Majesty, instead of bowing or curtsying. 

On presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'.

The then Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was criticised when she refused to curtsy to the Queen and not wearing a hat during a Royal tour of the country in October 2011

In 1992 Paul Keating was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a crowd of people. 

This was viewed as a sign of disrespect as courtiers are apt to warn, 'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen.'

Cherie Blair, an ardent republican, was widely criticised for refusing to bow to the Queen at Balmoral in 1997 - this reportedly left the late Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, 'mortified'.  

In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception. 

During a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds.

Finding herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder - before both women moved gently apart.

In May 2011, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland, Irish president Mary McAleese greeted the Queen with a simple handshake.

Six months later, the then prime minster of Australia, Julia Gillard, refused to curtsy to the Queen and also drew criticism for not wearing a hat during a ten-day Royal tour of the country. 

Only this week, David Cameron issued an apology to the Queen after he was overheard saying to the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that she 'purred' down the line on hearing Scotland had voted against independence in last week’s referendum.

The prime minister’s remark  was inadvertently picked up by Sky News. His lapse breached the convention that the prime minister never speaks about his conversations with the monarch and put in question her traditional neutrality.

This week, actor Stephen Fry admitted he had snorted cocaine at Buckingham Palace in his new autobiography, More Fool Me, which is published on Thursday.

But the TV presenter is not the only celebrity to have stepped out of line in the royal residence.

Almost 50 years ago, John Lennon claimed the Beatles smoked cannabis in a royal toilet before going on to receive their MBEs from the Queen.

Barney Keen, a 17-year-old who attended a 2003 garden party with the Queen, decided it was the time to streak and was promptly chased by a Yeoman of the Guard and eventually rugby tackled to the ground - only 100 yards from the Queen.

Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood received her OBE from the Queen in 1992 - wearing no knickers. 

During a garden party in 2009, a sudden downpour forced the Queen to invite guests into her private tent. But when the staff cleared up, they realised guests had  made off with some of her prized possessions, including Georgian and Victorian forks and spoons, plates and tea cups bearing the Queen's cipher.
