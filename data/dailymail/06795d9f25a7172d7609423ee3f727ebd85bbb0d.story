The National Rifle Association has taken aim at former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords just as she is seeking to push for bipartisan legislation on gun safety.

Giffords spoke on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and called for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales including at gun shows and internet sales.

'Gabby Giffords: Everyone Should Have to Pass Background Check My Attacker Passed,' tweeted the NRA, which isn't in favor of the legislation, in response on Thursday.

The tweet, sent to the organization's 264,000 followers, included a link to an article published on the right-wing Breitbart website that argued that background checks don't reduce gun violence

Giffords was shot in the head in an assassination attempt by crazed gunman Jared Loughner. He murdered six and wounded 18 other people, including Giffords, when he opened fire at an event near Tucson, Arizona in 2011. 

The tweet, sent to the organization's 264,000 followers, included a link to an article published on the right-wing Breitbart website that argued that background checks don't reduce gun violence.

The story noted that Loughner had passed a background check.

'Stopping violence takes courage,' said Giffords on Wednesday. 'Now is the time to come together and be responsible. Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting.'

Giffords won a tremendous amount of public sympathy and admiration for her brave fightback from serious injury and up until now the NRA has refrained from attacking her. 

Several lawmakers have blasted the NRA over its tweet mocking Giffords.

'Gabby Giffords is a fighter,' Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a friend of Giffords, told The Daily News. 'Personal attacks on Twitter are not going to stop her from working hard every single day to pass common sense gun safety laws that save lives.'

'The NRA's brazen response is as predictable as it is pathetic,' said Rep. Kathleen Rice, who is among the co-sponsors of the bill.

She called the attack 'blatant fear-mongering and desperate intimidation' aimed at derailing common-sense laws. 

Supporters of the law say that even though the likes of Loughner passed background checks, a uniform federal requirement would help stop many other dangerous people from buying gun and reduce gun violence rates.

'No one can deny the fact that it will help prevent violent criminals from buying guns,' Rice said.
