Organisers of one of the country's largest agricultural shows are investigating claims that cattle have been tampered with to improve their appearance.

Bosses at the Great Yorkshire Show have warned tactics such as glueing extra hair onto animals will not be tolerated.

Other methods of improving the way cattle look include pumping up udders with liquid or gas and then sealing the teats.

Allegations: Bosses at the Great Yorkshire are investigating claims cattle have been tampered with to improve their appearance. These Highland cattle are being prepared for exhibiting at the show

Competition: A steward makes sure the next round of cows are prepared for the Jersey cow section at the Great Yorkshire Show

Two cases of tampering are currently being investigated - the first time in the event's 155-year history that such allegations have come to light.

Bill Cowling, honorary show director of the Great Yorkshire Show, described the practice as 'despicable and heinous' and warned a screening system is in operation.

On the second day of the event, he confirmed investigations were underway into two suspected cases after checks by the Yorkshire Show's vets when animals were brought out of the ring.

He said: 'The owners have been informed, and any substances which may contravene the Society's malpractice rules are being analysed.Â 

Cooling off: The cattle classes are a hugely popular part of the show

'The animals continue to participate in the show.'

Results will not be available before the end of the show and could take between two to three weeks.

Mr Cowling said: 'If they were confirmed, those animals would be stripped of their awards and the exhibitors would be banned from the show.

'Any prize money would also be forfeited. We have been carrying out random testing for three years and these are the first two animals that need further investigation.

'We warned before the show that we would take any suspicions of tampering very seriously.'

The cattle classes are a hugely popular part of the show with major breeders coming from all over the country to compete.

Each year the Great Yorkshire Show, which took place in Harrogate over three days this week, attracts around 1,000 cattle entries.
