Once bitten, twice shy, the old saying goes.

It’s advice that Michelle Spencer clearly has no time for.

After being left penniless and broken-hearted by a Tunisian toyboy she met online, the 51-year-old claims to have found love again.

And amazingly, her new love is another young man from Tunisia ... whom she met while surfing the same Internet chatrooms.

Michelle Spencer and her former husband Rami Selmi, who she spent her life savings on over two years

The divorcee says she blew £18,000 of her benefits money on toyboy No1, smooth-talking 22-year-old Rami Selmi, after he showered her with compliments online and begged her to come to his country to meet him in person.

She agreed, and at the end of a two-week holiday Rami proposed. Despite warnings from her family, Miss Spencer said yes, and used her savings to arrange the wedding in Tunisia before flying home without her new husband, as he had no UK visa.

As soon as she returned to Stockport in Greater Manchester, she claims, Rami started bombarding her with messages asking for money.

Then, when she visited him again in Tunisia, his ardour appeared to have cooled and he insisted they sleep in separate beds.

Miss Spencer, who claims incapacity benefit for depression, said she spent her entire life savings on Rami during their two-year marriage, which ended when their divorce was finalised two weeks ago.

Now, however, she claims she is turning things around with the help of her new 26-year-old Tunisian boyfriend Mesbeh, saying: ‘I know he wants me for who I am.’

She added: ‘I am very happy with Mesbeh and I have definitely learned from my mistake.’

Miss Spencer’s problems began three years ago when she met Rami in an online chatroom following her divorce from her first husband of 24 years.

‘It all happened very quickly but it was a whirlwind and it felt so right,’ she said. ‘I didn’t mind spending the money at first. I was completely swept off my feet.’

Her daughter Rachel, 19, warned her she was being taken for a ride but Miss Spencer ignored the advice, saying: ‘I thought she was being silly.’

She added: ‘Rami would ask me for money for things like driving lessons so he could get a job.

‘I didn’t mind sending it over, because he was my husband after all, and I was sure he would treat me as soon as he got a job.

‘I feel foolish giving him the money now, but I loved him and I thought he loved me. But now I feel as though he was using me. He even disappeared to go out drinking with friends on our wedding day.’

Despite her heartbreak, Miss Spencer insisted she is not worried about the same thing happening with her new boyfriend.

‘I’ve been with Mesbeh for 19 months and it’s going really great,’ she said. ‘He is so different from Rami. 

Despite losing her savings on the failed marriage, Ms Spencer is happy to have found love with another Tunisian man

‘He doesn’t ask me for money at all and we talk online for a couple of hours every day. I’ll try and go and see him again as soon as I can, but it’s hard now I have spent all my money on Rami.

‘Mesbeh is a trained sports coach so he doesn’t need my money. That’s why I know it’s love. All he will ask me for is a bottle of vodka from duty free when I come and visit him.’

Miss Spencer added: ‘My advice to anyone chatting to men online is watch out for the sweet-talkers.

‘Never send money, no matter how much they pester you. I was foolish and I don’t want anyone else to make the same mistake.’
