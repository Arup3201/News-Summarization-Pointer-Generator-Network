Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Wales is that this cauldron of noise, which at kick-off seemed so threatening, was reduced to a quiet hum after the 50th minute.

That was the moment when Gareth Bale reminded us why Real Madrid paid £86million for his signature, why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in Spain seems so odd.

Having drawn a foul from Eytan Tibi inches outside the box with his pace, he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any. His shot curled over the wall with surgical placement, leaving goalkeeper Ofir Marciano stock still. It was pure quality.

His rapturous celebration spoke of the goal’s personal significance and collective importance. He answered his critics without uttering a word and made certain a momentous victory in Welsh ambitions to reach Euro 2016.

It was his 15th goal in 49 caps for Wales, moving him level with John Charles in the all-time scorers chart. He went past the great man 13 minutes from the end to rubber stamp Wales’s ascension to top of Group B at the halfway stage on 11 points and within sight of a first major tournament since 1958.

Aaron Ramsey provided the assist, seizing possession on the left and cutting back for Bale to finish into the corner. It was goal number 20 for Bale in a season that has been judged underwhelming in Spain.

Ramsey deserves praise too, having turned in his best performance in a Welsh shirt for some considerable time, getting the opener eight seconds into first-half injury time that sucked the feverish hostility from the throats of Israel’s fans.

It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano.

Ramsey celebrated by running to the 900 Wales fans and pointing to the skies, his grandmother having died last week. Bale dedicated the win to much-loved kitman Dai Williams, who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands.

By the end, Wales were running through 10-man Israel at will, Tibi having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2-0 for fouling Bale again.

Substitute Sam Vokes, making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury, nearly scored, as Bale twice went close to getting his hat-trick.

Israel are no mugs. Their 3-0 win over Bosnia here in November and perfect record prior to this game, is indication of that. But they were made to look woefully short by Wales.

Bale said: ‘We’re in a good position now and we’ve got a chance of qualifying. We will keep fighting and working hard and hopefully our performances and results will do all the talking. It’s amazing to be top of the table and we go from here.’

Chris Coleman was ebullient, and said Bale had responded in perfect fashion to the scathing judgments in Spain. ‘A plus with international football is when you come away from your clubs, then you are concentrating on something different,’ said the Wales manager.

‘There's a bit of criticism flying at Gareth in Madrid, but he did tonight what he's been doing for some time with Wales.’ Coleman thinks three wins from five remaining matches will seal qualification.

All the ingredients to make this a defining night were mixed together in the Sammy Ofer Stadium. Two nations enjoying unprecedentedly good qualifying campaigns with designs on reaching a major finals for the first time in a generation.

The noise for the Israel national anthem as thousands held up Star of David flags told you that. The whistles greeting early touches by Wales players were piercing in the extreme.

Bale’s name over the tannoy drew louder cat calls than any. ‘Haters gonna hate,’ read a sign in the away section, directed more towards Real Madrid’s critical following than those here in Haifa.

He did have at least one fan in the home crowd. A poster of ‘We love you Bale’ could be seen behind one goal.

Little battles all over the pitch showed the tension. An early shove by Neil Taylor on Orel Dgani as the pair tussled for a throw in drew high-pitched screeching from the stands. James Collins suggested Eli Guttman might ‘f*** off’ when the Israel manager appealed for a card after Omri Ben Harush dramatically rolled on the turf following a collision for a high ball.

Wales took control where it mattered, Joe Allen, Joe Ledley and Ramsey exhibiting their Premier League pedigree.

Their pressure cranked up with a sustained spell in the Israel half on 20 minutes. As the seconds ticked on the disapproving clamour from the home fans grew unbearable almost.

Allen had a shot blocked, Ramsey a corner cleared and then Bale delivered a wonderful cross to an unmarked Welshman at the back stick. Unfortunately it was Collins, who stood on the ball from two yards out rather than apply the finishing touch that had seemed certain. The pause allowed Israel to clear.

In the end, as Wales fans sung ‘We are top of the league’, it was a mere footnote
