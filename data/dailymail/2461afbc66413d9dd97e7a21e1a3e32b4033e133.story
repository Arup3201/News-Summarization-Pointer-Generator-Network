When it comes to being healthy, the world’s priority is getting more sleep rather than eating healthy food, exercising or taking vitamins, a poll has found.

Worldwide, 66 per cent of people  get enough sleep, compared to 59 per cent who eat healthy food and 57 per cent who regularly exercise.

Indonesians and Indians are the most well-rested, with 85 and 77 per cent respectively reporting they get enough sleep.

Meanwhile the Polish and Russians get by with the least shut-eye, with only 51 per cent and 52 per cent getting enough rest to maintain health.

The poll, by market research organisation GfK, questioned more than 28,000 in 23 countries on which activities they regularly do to maintain their physical health.

Graphic shows the percentage of people in each country (arranged alphabetically, going from Argentina, clockwise, to the USA) who get enough sleep (red), eat healthy food  (green) or exercise (blue). These were the top activities people worldwide report they carry out to maintain physical health

Globally, people focus more on sleep than on regular oral care, and more on exercise than spending time with friends, family or pets. The graph shows the top five activities people around the world say they carry out in order to maintain their physical health. It also breaks down each category by gender, showing more women take part in health promoting behaviours than men - except when it comes to exercise

It found only that while sushi may be touted as a diet option, only 29 per cent of people in Japan say they eat healthy food.

And while curry is billed as a high-calorie Friday night treat, 79 per cent of people in India say they eat healthily.

Mexico and China have the highest number of people who exercise on a regular basis (68 per cent and 67 per cent), while Japan and Russia have fewer fitness fanatics (39 per cent and 40 per cent).

For the survey, GfK interviewed  people aged 15 or older in 23 countries either online or face-to-face in summer 2014. 

The countries included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, Ukraine and the USA.

They were asked which activity they were most likely to carry out in order to maintain their physical health, from a list of 14 activities from sleep and exercise to unplugging from technology and meditating. 

Their questioning revealed having a cosmetic procedure - whether surgical or non-surgical - was the least popular way of maintaining health, with only 6 per cent of people globally choosing to do this. 

The study found stark differences between the sexes, especially when it comes to sun safety.

Globally, women are over twice as likely than men to use sunscreen than men, it found.

People in Brazil slather on the most suncream, at 46 per cent, while Australia and Spain both trail at 42 per cent.

And having children seems to make people more healthy. Parents get 2 per cent more sleep than non-parents and lead on eating healthy food by 8 per cent. 

You might think running around after children would put parents in the lead on exercise, but in fact non-parents edged in front by 3 per cent.

Graph shows, from top to bottom, the activities the majority of people worldwide carried out to maintain their physical health. Sleep and eating healthily topped the list, while using herbal, holistic or alternative remedies, massages or spa treatments or undergoing a cosmetic procedure were bottom of the list

The activities people in the UK said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). More people in the UK used skin care, beauty or personal grooming products than the global average (44 per cent compared with 38 per cent) but Britons are less likely to use meditation or relaxation techniques than the global average (9 per cent compared with 17 per cent)

The activities people in the US said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). In the US, spending time with family and friends topped the list of health-promoting activities, with a whopping 71 per cent carrying out this activity, compared to a global average of 53 per cent. But Americans lagged behind the worldwide average when it comes to following a specific diet (17 per cent compared with 18 per cent)

The activities people in the Australia said they carried out to be healthy (light blue) compared to the global average (dark blue). More Australians took vitamins and supplements than the global average (45 per cent compared to 32 per cent) but they were not so prolific in getting massages or spa treatments (12 per cent compared to a global average of 14 per cent)

There will be differences across countries in what people think of as being 'healthy, nutritious food', a GfK analyst said

Mexico topped the global list for exercise, but are they really the fittest?

A spokesperson for GfK explained that cultural differences could explain the results...

He told MailOnline: 'The study reports what people are consciously doing regularly to maintain their physical health, so the findings reflect not only what activities people are doing, but also what activities they associate with being specifically for physical health.

'There is also the question of cultural background – for example, the normal level of work-life balance within each country will impact amount of sleep and perceptions of how much sleep is necessary for physical health.

'There will also be differences across countries in exactly what people think of as being ‘exercise’ or ‘healthy, nutritious food’. 

'For example – Mexico is known as having a growing level of obesity since the 1980s, but it also reports the highest number of consumers who claim to exercise on a regular basis to maintain their physical health.

'An explanation for this is not necessarily that Mexico is full of hard-core gym fanatics; it’s more likely to be that health focus has gone from widespread malnutrition before 1980s to growing levels of obesity now, so this is very much in the national focus and higher levels of the population have this issue "front of mind". 

'They will therefore be more broadly aware than other countries of the need for exercise and are therefore likely to assign lower levels of activity (e.g. walking to the shops) into the category of ‘exercising’ than, for example, populations in UK or Germany who might only assign going to the gym or playing sport as ‘exercising’.'
