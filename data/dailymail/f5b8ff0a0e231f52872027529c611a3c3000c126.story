Two brave foxes turned the tables and went from being the hunted to the hunters as they give chase to a terrified cheetah.

They tried to look as big as possible by making 
their hair, in particular on their tails, stand on end.

The bizarre pursuit happened when a young cheetah came across a bat-eared fox in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of Tanzania.

Change of plan: The moment the tables were turned on a cheetah by a brave pair of bat eared foxes

Believing it was alone, the cheetah crept up on its intended prey only for a second fox to arrive on the 
scene and team-up with its cousin.

The tables were quickly turned and the two foxes chased after the cheetah which sprinted off.

Astrid Kindsvogel, an amateur wildlife photographer, took the photographs while on holiday in Tanzania last month.

Astrid, 44, a commercial manager who lives in Heidelberg in Germany, said: 'We were out early and driving around on the lookout for interesting wildlife.

'We came across a cheetah and close by was this bat-eared fox that was resting.

'I was thinking this could turn into something very interesting and then the cheetahs spotted the fox and started stalking it.

'But within seconds another fox paired up with the other and they tried to look as big as possible by making their hair, in particular on their tails, stand on end.

'Before I knew it the foxes were chasing the cheetah. It looked to me like it was a bit of a game and they weren't interested in hurting each other.

'Wildlife has been my passion for as long as I can remember and my interest in photography has developed over the years.

'This was one of the most unusual encounters I have ever seen.'
