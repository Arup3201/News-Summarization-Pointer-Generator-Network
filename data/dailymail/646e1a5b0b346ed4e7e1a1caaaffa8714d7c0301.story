The Empire State Building is doing its part to bring awareness to the plight of Filipinos affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan.

The iconic New York skyscraper was illuminated red, blue, yellow and white – the colors of the Philippine flag – to help make people more aware of the need for donations and aid in regions ravaged by the monster storm.

Over 10,000 people were initially feared killed by Haiyan, more than 3,000 have been confirmed dead by Philippine officials as of Friday. Hundreds of thousands more are displaced or without food, water or electricity.

The gesture comes as accusations of politicians prioritizing relief distribution are coming to a head in the devastated country and images of the suffering masses are seen around the world.

The building will adorn the colors of the country’s flag both Friday and Saturday nights, and Filipino followers of its Twitter feed couldn’t be happier.

‘I love this. Of course, made me cry. Beautiful!’ Tweeted @chenoite.

‘Maraming Salamat!I can see the lights ffrom Woodside,Queens! Cant help but shed tears for my countrymen,’ wrote one follower.

‘Thank you for the love, NYC!!!’ another follower replied.

A quick glance at the lighting schedule posted to the tower's website shows it lighting in pink for breast cancer awareness, in all green for City Harvest and Earth Day and  in all blue for World Autism Awareness Day.

The high-rise lights up in different colors each day to commemorate everything from sports teams to charities and other events.

Dozens of countries and companies have pitched in to the relief effort, but officials have pleaded for even more.

‘In a situation like this, nothing is fast enough,’ an official said during a press conference from the decimated city of Tacloban.

‘The need is massive, the need is immediate, and you can't reach everyone.’

Some estimates place the number of displaced over 600,000 and the injured over 12,000. Thousands more are missing and presumed dead.

Tales abound of tragedies, including one woman shown on CNN who gave birth just weeks before the storm only to have it take her husband from her as the storm surge raged through Tacloban.

CNN has reported seeing cadaver bags being washed and reused, as well as people surviving the storm only die of a terrible infection in the aftermath. Bodies are being buried in mass graves.

A sailor in the Philippine Navy who was helping clear bodies and debris from the city’s streets found his own mother slumped against the wall of a damaged building, according to CNN.

Most survivors who stayed behind even as evacuation orders were given are no being flown out of Tacloban, which more resembles an apocalyptic movie scene than the bustling port city of more than 200,000 people it once was.

At its height, Haiyan battered the island nation with winds upwards of 200MPH, 30-foot storm surges and relentless rains.
