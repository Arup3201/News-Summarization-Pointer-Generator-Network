Inspiring: Peter Deal's victim came forward after hearing former England rugby star Brian Moore, pictured, talk about his own childhood abuse

A former boxing coach was jailed today for raping and abusing a schoolboy 40 years ago, after the victim was prompted to break decades of silence by former England rugby star Brian Moore’s disclosures that he was sexually abused as a child.

Peter Deal, 74, was jailed for five years at Inner London Crown Court after previously pleading guilty to seven charges, ranging from buggery to indecent assault, between 1969 and 1973.

The court heard his victim, now 54, had not told anyone about the abuse he endured from the age of 10 to 13 until he heard a radio interview with former Harlequins player Moore, nicknamed Pitbull, about the abuse he endured at the hands of one of his teachers.

In his autobiography Beware of the 
Dog, Moore, now 50, said the abuse began when he and three other boys, 
aged nine and 10, were lured into a tent and sexually abused by a 
teacher while on a field trip in Yorkshire.

He
said the childhood traumas made him ferociously competitive on the 
rugby field and contributed to the breakdown of two marriages.

Today
Inner London Crown Court heard how a radio interview with Moore 
prompted Deal’s victim to break 40 years of silence - telling his wife 
and then the police that he had been abused as a boy by his then-boxing 
coach.

Sentencing Deal 
to five years in prison, Judge Roger Chapple told him: 'The offences to 
which you have pleaded guilty reflect a course of conduct, a course of 
persistent sexual abuse of a child, conduct which fills any 
right-thinking person with revulsion.'

He said Deal’s victim had to live with his abuse 'for the best part of 40 years'.

Judge Chapple continued: 'For my part, I find it not remotely difficult to understand that he did not feel able to report that systematic abuse that he suffered at your hands.'

The court heard Deal was previously 
jailed for eight years in 2006 for abusing two boys he met at the same 
boxing club involved in today’s case. His sentence was reduced to seven 
on appeal and he was released in 2011.

Judge
Chapple added: 'In July 2006 you were convicted of five offences of 
indecent assault upon two boys, aged 10 to 11 and 13 to 15.

'These offences took place in 2000 or thereabouts but there are many similarities, particularly your abuse of your position as a coach at a sports club to commit these offences.'

He said if the judge in Deal’s last case had known about these offences, he would have been given a far longer prison term.

He went on: 'You are 74 years of age, plainly in ill-health. Taking these matters into account, the right sentence in my judgment is an overall sentence today of five years in prison.”

He said Deal was already subject to a lifetime Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Prosecutor Chris Stimpson today told 
the court that Deal was a coach at Rippleway Newham Football Club - the 
youth team that produced England and Arsenal star Sol Campbell - when he
first met his victim.

He
first indecently touched the boy when he gave him a lift home after 
training, then went on to repeat the abuse on future occasions in his 
car, Mr Stimpson said.

Deal introduced the boy to East Ham 
Boxing Club, where he also coached, taking him to training and 
collecting him from his house, as well as taking the boy - then aged 12 -
to his own home.

The court heard that during the 
summer holidays he even persuaded the boy’s parents to allow him to stay
with him before a five-a-side tournament, when he raped him.

Mr Stimpson said the victim estimated he was raped by deal about 50 times in total.

'The
allegations came to light in August 2011 when the victim was listening 
to an interview with the former rugby international Brian Moore on 5 
Live radio, who was talking candidly about the sexual abuse he 
experienced, the prosecutor told the court.

'He therefore told his wife on August 19, 2011. He had previously decided never to tell anyone about what happened as he was so ashamed and he refers in his statement to planning to kill himself on two occasions prior to coming forward to the police.'

Mr Stimpson said the victim, now 54, had said: 'All my life I have felt dirty and not a real man. I now look back at things I have done and still do.

'I constantly shower, sometimes even twice a day,' he said, something the court heard his wife had also noticed.

Deal originally denied the charges, but pleaded guilty to seven of an original 17 charges in October last year.

In a statement issued through his lawyers, Deal’s victim said today: 'I am relieved that I have finally been able to face the events of the past and that my tormentor is to be punished by the court for his crimes.

'My fear, though, is that other boys were abused by this man and, if they were, I would urge them to do as I have done and to contact the police and seek legal advice.'

Molly Whittall, abuse case specialist solicitor from law firm Pannone, confirmed they are advising him on a possible civil action against East Ham Boxing Club, which has since moved from the area.

She said: 'It is by no means uncommon for the memories of abuse to be suppressed for many years until something acts as a trigger to reawaken them.

'In this case it was the brave admission of a former sportsman, Brian Moore, that brought back past events, possibly striking a chord with our client because he was himself a keen sportsman in his youth and was at one time on the books of a Premier League football club.

'We are currently attempting to trace where the club moved to, what its new name is or who the club merged with.

'I would be grateful if anyone with any information could contact me here at Pannone on 0161 909 4606.'
