Next time you're doing your weekly shop you could soon pick up a detailed 3D-printed miniature version of yourself as well as your groceries.

Asda has become the first supermarket in the UK to offer 3D printing services, with prices starting at £40 - more than 60 per cent cheaper than other retailers, it claims.  

Anything can be scanned, including people and even cars, to produce detailed digital models. These designs are then sent to a 3D printing factory that creates lifelike figures made of high-quality ceramic.

A group from Texas-based Systems and 
Materials Research Corporation has created a 3D-printed pizza made with 
dough, ketchup and cream cheese.

The printer is still being developed,
 but the video shows the printer laying down a layer of dough, a layer 
of ketchup and then cheese.

It is then baked on a heated surface.

The software can identify up to six million different colours.

It measures a person, or item's, proportions exactly. Models can then be scaled to whatever size the customers wants.

In a statement, Asda said: 'Evolving well beyond simply filling 
frames with photographs of friends and family, 3D printed ‘mini me’ 
figures will add a whole new dimension to shoppers’ mantelpieces.

'The
 lifelike models are also expected to be popular as personalised wedding
 cake toppers, and you could even have a model of your family pet.'

Asda's 3D printing scanner, pictured, is portable and plugs into a regular socket. To start the process, an Asda employee moves the flashing scanner around the subject, pictured, which picks up individual pixels. This connects directly to software that captures the image

The digital design is sent to a 3D printing factory where the shape is recreated by spraying ceramic fluid in thin layers to build up a solid object, pictured. Excess ceramic is brushed off and recycled

Figures can be made in colour, white or covered in a bronze-style coating, pictured

In
 order to create the 3D print, scanner cameras are moved around 
the subject covering the entire surface area. This takes around two minutes.

The shape is then recreated in 3D form by spraying ceramic 
fluid in thin layers to build up a solid object.

Figures are then printed and ready to pick up as part of shoppers’ next weekly shop.

They can be made in colour, white or covered in a bronze-style coating.

Asda is trialling the service in its York store from 15 October before planning to roll out the service nationwide.
