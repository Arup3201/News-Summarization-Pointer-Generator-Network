The Grand Memo II LTE has a 6-inch display with spilt-screen functions

Just hours after Nokia announced its first Android budget phone, Chinese firm ZTE has unveiled its latest range of devices in Barcelona. 

The first phone, named the Grand Memo II LTE, has a 6-inch display with split-screen functions, meaning people can watch films and tweet, or look at emails while reading news on a browser at the same time. 

The second announcement was the lower-budget ZTE Open C, the first phone in its range to run the Firefox operating system – developed by the same company that makes the Firefox web browser.

The higher-spec Grand Memo II LTE has a 3200mAh battery which ZTE claims can last 16 hours on standby, combined with software designed to save and extend this battery life. 

It also has a 13MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP lens on the front.

ZTE has added Smile Recognition as well as many of the advanced features, including ISO and White Balance, seen on Nokia's Lumia 1020 device. 

The phone also doubles up as a remote control for all smart devices in a home, including TVs and radios.

The Open C is a low-entry device with a 4-inch screen with a 3MP front-facing camera. Prices have not been officially announced for either device but they are due to go on sale in China from April, followed by North America and Europe

It also features a 3200mAh battery which ZTE claims

The company has added a 13MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP lens on the front, which includes Smile Recognition technology.

The phone also doubles up as a remote control and can beam content to smart TVs.

ZTE Open C

The lower-budget ZTE Open C is the first phone in
 its range to run the Firefox operating system.

It features a 4-inch screen with a 3MP front-facing camera.

Powering the device is a 1.2GHz, dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor and a 1,400mAh battery.

Additionally, the screen of the Grand Memo II LTE also beams content to smart TVs so people can watch on a big screen what is being played on the phone's smaller screen.

Elsewhere it has smart finger gestures that take screenshots, and a highly-sensitive screen that can be used while wearing gloves.

Prices have not been officially announced for either device but they are due to go on sale in China from April, followed by North America and Europe.

ZTE also unveiled its Projector Hotspot, a mini projector and Wi-Fi hostspot, and a new interface called MiFavor 2.3.

Speaking at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona, Adam Zeng, CEO of ZTE mobile devices and executive vice president of ZTE Corporation said: ‘This year, we are looking to work even more closely with our customers worldwide to develop the products they want and deliver a superior customer experience. 

'They have told us that they want ever more innovative and high-performance products, so at MWC 2014 we are delivering this with the launch of two new high-profile devices.

‘We expect 2014 to be our strongest year yet – and we’re putting our customers at the heart of everything we do to help us achieve that.’

Mr.LV Qianhao head of handsets strategy at ZTE told MailOnline that they chose Firefox OS because it uses HTML 5 and is more versatile.

'ZTE is always looking for new markets, and Firefox in particular appeals to geeks,' he said.

He continued that this is because the demographic in particular is a difficult market to target because they're so particular with what they want.

'They want the next generation; the future, now. That's what Firefox offers,' he said.

The Firefox OS was launched in February 2012 by Mozilla, the same company that makes the Firefox browser. 

It
 runs on Linux-based software and is open source, meaning developers can
 have access to the code and use this to help them build apps, for 
example. It was designed to rival other operating systems, but in 
particular Android, which is also open source. 

Mozilla is a non-profit organisation and this reduces the price the phones sell for. 

ZTE
 Open C is the first in its range to run Firefox OS, yet Alcatel has 
also announced phones running the software, including the OneTouch Fire S
 with a quad-core processor and 4G support.
