It was a case of let the brush see the boot for Paddy McGuinness at Bolton's training ground on Friday.

The Take Me Out host and former Phoenix Nights star came good on a pledge he made before Wanderers' 2-1 win over Blackburn on Boxing Day.

McGuinness, a Bolton fan, tweeted: 'If @EmileHeskeyUK comes off the bench today and scores for us I'll personally clean his boots! C'mon Bolton!!!!'

The comedian shares his thoughts as his honours his pledge made on Boxing Day

Heskey did indeed score - the equaliser from Eidur Gudjohnsen's pass - and the comedian made it clear he would honour his pledge.

The day after the match he posted on Twitter: 'For those asking about my bet, cleaning @EmileHeskeyUK boots. I'm a man of my word, just waiting for a date from the club. Keep u posted.'

And on the day he could not hide his excitement, saying: 'Just getting organised, got to go & settle a bet. Time to clean the big mans @EmileHeskeyUK boots! Off to @OfficialBWFC training ground.'

And, in front of a laughing Heskey and Bolton manager Neil Lennon at Euxton, he did indeed scrub the big striker's boots, which will be worn in Saturday's FA Cup tie at home to Wigan. 

And afterwards he told his followers: 'There you go, a man of my word. @EmileHeskeyUK boots, spotless!!!' 

Heskey agreed, saying: 'He did a good job. All the mud was gone.

'They're my only pair, so I'll definitely be wearing them tomorrow.'

Mind you Paddy, you did make Emile of it (sorry). 

Bolton, meanwhile, have given a trial to MVV Maastricht's 22-year-old Dutch defender Nick Kuipers.
