Another day, another wave of Apple rumours - this time about the potential demise of the iPhone 5.

A Chinese source claims the company will stop making its current flagship phone when it releases its upcoming, rumoured, iPhone 5S and iPhone Lite models.

The reports claims Apple wants to focus its attentions on, and ultimately promote more sales of, the newer designs.

These rumours come at the same time Apple is said to be having production difficulties with the new phones, in particular the iPhone 5S, meaning the release date could be pushed back to the end of September.

Chinese site ETNews believes Apple could discontinue the iPhone 5 to focus solely on its rumoured, upcoming new models.

Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset.

Dubbed iPhone Mini or iPhone Lite, the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made
of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera.

Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400).

Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen.

There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year.

The iPhone 5S was expected to be released on 13 September, with the cheaper version due at the start of October.

Production problems are now said to have pushed this date back, meaning the iPhone Lite could be released before the high-end iPhone 5.

Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal claimed suppliers in Asia had said Apple recently asked for prototypes of screens 
that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone.

It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays.

This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the 
current model.

Chinese site ETNews claims that the touchscreen technology currently used on the iPhone 5 is 'not suitable for low-volume production'.

This means that when fewer people are buying the iPhone 5 because new models are on the market, Apple will potentially spend more money on production costs than they make back in sales.

Apple is expected to therefore abandon production of the iPhone 5, focusing on the
high-end successor as well as the rumoured cheaper, plastic model dubbed the iPhone Mini or iPhone Lite.

If true, this would go against Apple's current policy to keep its previous two models in production at a cheaper price, to attract lower-end customers.

However, AppleInsider added that the company's CEO Tim Cook recently said the the iPhone 5 was the company's most popular iPhone 'by far.'

The site also quotes recent data that suggests  the device makes up half of Apple's iPhone sales.

In a separate report, AppleInsider has also learnt that the new models could be delayed due to production problems.

According to a research note found by the site, written by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, there have been 'setbacks in the production of numerous components' meaning the handset may be pushed back to the end of September.

The model was expected to launch on 13 September, with the iPhone Lite due at the start of October.

This delay could see the cheaper iPhone released before the high-end model.

The iPhone 5S is expected to have a fingerprint scanner and an updated camera and it may be these new features that are causing the delays.

Accessory manufacturer Tactus published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model earlier this year. The design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera and could cost as little as £63 ($99)

The Telegraph also reported in June that accessory manufacturer Tactus had published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model, rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera.

Other reports about the plastic iPhones suggest they could have with 4.7-inch screens.

They
could be available in a variety of colours including yellow and red - 
current iPhones and iPads only come in black and white - and may sell 
for as little as £63.

Earlier this month, reports in the 
Wall Street Journal claimed Apple was additionally testing larger 
screens, potentially for a 13-inch version of its iPad tablet.

If the rumours are true Apple's giant iPad could be same size as its MacBook Pro. It would also be bigger than some laptops, including HP's 11.6-inch EliteBook.

This mock-up shows what Apple's iPhone 6 handset could look like. It was designed by French technology site NowhereElse. The iPhone 6 - originally expected to be released in 2014 - could be announced as early as 27 September

At the same time Apple was said to be 
working on a larger, 5.7-inch iPhone dubbed a 'phablet' because its a 
cross between a phone and a tablet computer.

These rumours originated in a note to investors written by industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets.

Apple traditionally unveils new handsets at an annual event in September and this was bolstered by claims this week from the company's CFO Peter Oppenheimer who said the company was 'on track to have a very busy fall.'

As well as the new phones, Apple is believed to be working on a new MacBook Pro and iMac.

Latest rumours from suppliers in Asia suggest Apple is working on a 13-inch version of its iPad tablet. Reports claim the company is testing prototypes of larger screens that could be used on jumbo iPhones or iPads. If the rumours are true, this giant iPad could be three inches bigger than the current model, pictured

Mr White added the iPhone Mini might 'have a curved back casing made of coloured plastic and will be thicker than the iPhone 5.'

Other rumours to have generated from White's note include that the iPhone 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iPhone 5 model.

These rumours were also said to have come from sources within the phone maker's supply chain in Asia.

One person said to have 'direct knowledge of the matter, according to Reuters, said: 'They constantly change product specifications almost to the final moment, so you're not really sure whether this is the final prototype.'
