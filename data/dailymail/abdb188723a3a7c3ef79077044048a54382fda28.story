Free to go: A judge has ruled blind Florida man, John Wayne Rogers, 40, pictured, killed his friend, James T. DeWitt, 34, in self-defense

A blind Florida man was acquitted of murder after shooting and killing his friend on the state’s ‘stand your ground’ law.

Judge John Galluzzo cut the week-long murder trial short on Friday ruling that John Wayne Rogers, 40, killed his friend, James T. DeWitt, 34, in self-defense.

Florida's stand your ground law allows people to use lethal force if they feel 
their life is in danger, or if they think they could be seriously hurt.

The incident happened in Rogers’ Geneva home two years ago on March 27, 2012, after the two had embarked on a long drinking session, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Rogers, who is legally blind after having been injured in a work-related accident while testing a fire-suppression system in 2001, shot DeWitt once in the chest with a .308 Remington assault rifle, according to the defense attorney.

DeWitt and his girlfriend had gone to Rogers' house to drink beer and had spent the night. 

The next day the group had made a 10am trip to the store to buy more beer, according to Rogers' arrest report.

The defendant testified that he had asked DeWitt to leave but that the victim had attacked him, so he went into another room and retrieved his rifle. After Rogers pointed it in DeWitt's general direction, he said DeWitt charged him.

‘He felt like he had no choice but to shoot him, and he did, said Assistant Public Defenders Tim Caudill, according to the Sentinel. The men were 18 inches apart or closer.

Infamous law: Florida's stand your ground law was invoked in the case of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, 17, pictured, on February 26, 2012

Acquitted: George Zimmerman, pictured, was on trial for shooting Trayvon Martin, which he said he did in self-defense. The trial was the subject of great criticism and garnered attention on a mass scale both nationally and internationally

DeWitt's girlfriend said the two men 
had been ‘play fighting’, something they sometimes did, when Rogers 
walked into another room, emerged with the rifle and without 
provocation, shot DeWitt.

Rogers
 had been charged with first-degree murder and has been in the Seminole 
County Jail for two years since he was arrested for the shooting.

Jurors
 were selected Monday and returned Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to hear
 evidence and argument in the case.

They were expected to begin 
deliberations Friday, had the judge not made his ruling.

The stand your ground
 law gained national attention after it was invoked in the case of 
George Zimmerman, who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on 
February, 26, 2012.
