Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has been caught resting her eyes in the middle of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's speech in New Zealand.

Ms Bishop reportedly caught a flight from Canberra late on Thursday night to attend the annual Australia-New Zealand leaders' meeting.

She arrived in Auckland at about 1am, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. 

It is believed she was up bright and early for her usual 6am morning jog on Friday, meaning she just had about five hours sleep - if not less - before attending a leadership forum with Mr Abbott.

This comes  after speculation over another leadership challenge against Mr Abbott where Malcolm Turnbull has reportedly been told by backbenchers that he has the numbers for a successful spill.

Since those reports emerged on Seven News yesterday, supporters of Ms Bishop also claimed the Foreign Affairs Minister was against the move and would stand against Mr Turnbull if it was to go ahead.

As Mr Abbott addressed the forum, which was also attended by New Zealand Prime Minister John Keys, Ms Bishop's eyelids were closed for a moment or two.

Her head also dropped briefly before she woke up again, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

When asked about Ms Bishop's nap during the speech, Mr Abbott said 'given the pace at which we all work, its absolutely understandable'.

'I've dozed off from time to time at conferences, all of us have from time to time dozed off at conferences,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.

It appears Ms Bishop's tight schedule, including her strict exercise routine, is finally catching up on her.

Earlier in the week, Ms Bishop was also seen making tracks to Parliament House in Canberra.

However Ms Bishop denied nodding off during Mr Abbott's speech on Friday, tweeting that she was: 'Not sleeping merely contemplating the media obsession with trivia'.

Speculation has been rife about a second leadership challenge - less than three weeks since Mr Abbott (front) survived a spill motion - as Mr Turnbull (right) has reportedly been told by MPs that he has the numbers to beat the Prime Minister. However it is believed Ms Bishop (left) is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead

Mr Abbott is in New Zealand for the annual Australia-New Zealand leaders' meeting, where he and Mr Keys will discuss combating terrorism, foreign fighters and the situation in Iraq.

His visit coincided with the 10th Australia-New Zealand leadership forum, attended by business, government and community leaders to discuss how to develop the bilateral partnership between the two nations.

This comes after rife speculation over a second leadership challenge - less than three weeks since Mr Abbott survived a spill motion.

Backbenchers have reportedly informed Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull that he's got the numbers for a successful spill motion to take the top job, according to Seven News.

But they've said the move would have to be initiated by senior ministers from the Cabinet.

It is believed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead.
