A Premier League football referee accused of racially abusing a black Chelsea will be sacked if found guilty, a former top official said today.

Mark Clattenburg is being formally investigated by the Football Association over the claims he hurled a racist insult at Chelsea star Obi Mikel when he was showed him a yellow card him in the 76th minute of yesterday's match against Manchester United.

He is also said to have called a Chelsea player a 'Spanish t**t' during the heated encounter. Today former referee Graham Poll said Clattenburg would be worried if he made the comments because his career would be over.

The sensational accusations come just one month after Chelsea captain John Terry was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing opponent Anton Ferdinand..

Former England captain Terry was 
acquitted in a criminal case over the incident, which occurred during a Premier League game in October last year, but later stepped down from the top 
position in English football.

One of Chelsea’s Spanish stars is also involved in the racism row, after players claim they heard Clattenburg refer to him as ‘a Spanish t**t’.

Spaniards Fernando Torres, Juan Mata 
and Cesar Azpilicueta all played against United in the tense 3-2 defeat, 
which saw Chelsea drop to nine men.

Chelsea made an official complaint to the match delegate, whose report today appeared to have been passed to the FA. Clattenberg will not officiate in any games this weekend because his presence would be a distraction, the Professional Game Match Officials Board said.

A statement from English football's governing body read: 'The FA has begun an investigation relating to allegations made following Sunday's fixture at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Manchester United.

'The FA will make no further comment at this time.'

Now the FA is set to demand footage 
of the alleged incidents from broadcaster Sky ahead of a possible 
disciplinary committee hearing. It is yet to launch a full 
investigation.

But
the controversy wasn't confined to the pitch, after shameful scenes saw
a steward taken to hospital after surging crowds crushed
him against a barrier at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground.

The shameful incident happened as 
Manchester United players celebrated a goal in front of Chelsea fans, 
who rushed forward in reaction.

The steward was carried away in a stretcher and taken to hospital where he was treated for a knee injury.

Players
also collected a shocking number of coins hurled at them during the 
game, along with a piece of seating which narrowly missed United players 
Javier Hernandez and Ashley Young as they celebrated near an away stand.

The club now faces both an FA and a police investigation into the incidents.

After the match Clattenburg was confronted  in the referee’s room by Mikel along with his team's chief executive Ron Gourlay  and manager Roberto Di Matteo demanding an apology.

But the referee refused to 
apologise and at 7.45pm last night Chelsea decided to take the 
incredible action of launching an immediate complaint to the Premier 
League over his language.

According to sources close to the players, they are willing to make statements to the FA’s disciplinary committee this week.

A
club spokesman said: ‘We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League 
match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the 
referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents in 
today’s match. The match delegate will pass the complaint to the FA.’

The
matter is now in the hands of the FA and Premier League officials, who 
will ask Sky TV for footage from the 20 camera angles used for live 
matches.

While not all are recorded, they should help confirm whether Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment.

Premier League referees also wear 
microphones, which suggests evidence by Michael McDonough and Simon Long
— who ran the line — or fourth official Michael Jones could be crucial.

Feelings towards Clattenburg were already running high before the game had ended and the allegations had even emerged.

The referee was heavily criticised for a series of decisions throughout the game which included allowing a Manchester United goal many considered to be off-side and wrongly sending off Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovic.

A FIFA and Barclays Premier League referee, he is expected to be put forward to be the English representation at the 2014 World Cup after taking charge of the Olympic men's football final between Brazil and Mexico at Wembley this year.

Tough time: Clattenburg was given a hostile reception by the Chelsea fans as he left the field

The incidents occurred on the day Chelsea threw support behind the Kick Racism Out of Football campaign.

Players
from Chelsea and United — with the exception of United’s Ashley Young —
wore One Game One Community T-shirts in the warm-up.

John Terry, serving a four-match ban for
racially insulting Anton Ferdinand last October, wore a Kick It Out 
badge as he watched from the sidelines.

Rio Ferdinand, fined £45,000 for his ‘choc ice’ tweet, also ended his feud with Ashley Cole when they shook hands before the game.

But all that was forgotten amid dramatic scenes nearly two hours after the final whistle.

Home players heard the alleged comment to Mikel and will back up his story. Clattenburg said he would  co-operate with any inquiry.

Professional Game Match Officials, the body which represents Premier League referees, released a statement which read: ‘PGMO is aware of the allegations and they are being treated with the utmost seriousness. Mark will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established.’

Last month John Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association who found him guilty of racial abuse during a Premier League clash at QPR’s Loftus Road.The 31-year-old Chelsea captain had denied an FA charge that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a Premier League match last October and was acquitted in a criminal case in July.It brought to an end 11 months of controversy surrounding the confrontation with the QPR player, who Terry was accused of calling a "f****** black c***’.

In August 2009 Clattenburg was suspended following allegations he owed £60,000 as a result of a failed venture.

He pulled out of a key match as a result and was later sacked by the Professional Game Match Officials board.

The following year he was reinstated as a Select Group Referee on appeal, but just months later he was handed a suspension after being accused of sending threatening emails to business associates.

In 2009 the referee enraged Manchester City staff after he turned to them and said ‘How do you put up with him?’ after sending off player Craig Bellamy, sparking concerns over his impartiality In 2005 he was the referee who failed to spot Pedro Mendes’s ‘ghost goal’ at Old Trafford for Tottenham.In 2007 he sent off Everton player Tony Hibbert, apparently upgrading his yellow card to red after consulting with Liverpool player Steven Gerrard. It was five years later that he was next allowed to rule over an Everton game.
