With just over seven months to go until he becomes a father for the second time, the Duke of Cambridge has clearly decided some extra help is required.

During an investiture at Windsor Castle, a 'charming' Prince William asked one of the nation’s most senior midwives if she would like to 'come and help' him and his wife.

Professor Lesley Page, president of the Royal College of Midwives spoke to the royal about the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy when he presented her with a CBE.

'Well I’m a midwife so he talked about Catherine’s pregnancy,' explained Professor Page following the investiture.

'We talked about my being a midwife for well over 30 years and what’s changed, and what I’m doing now after becoming president of the Royal College of Midwives.'

Asked whether she gave the prince any advice, she said: 'I almost said to him the second is much easier but I don’t think I quite got that out.

'He actually said to me, "Would you like to come and help us?"' Unsurprisingly, Professor Page's response was: 'Yes, of course.'

Professor Page received her CBE for services to midwifery and delightedly told journalists afterwards that she is 'very proud' of her profession.

Speaking about meeting William at what was the first investiture ceremony he has held at Windsor Castle, the professor said he was 'very charming', adding: 'and he said he was well looked after by midwives'.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who is pregnant with her second child, is being treated for hyperemesis gravidarum, a form of acute morning sickness.

As a result, Kate has not been seen in public since the news of a second royal baby was announced and has had to scale back her engagements on the advice of doctors. 

But although William was happy to discuss the royal pregnancy with Professor Page, she revealed that he said nothing about she is currently doing.

Yesterday the duchess sent a message of support to a children’s art therapy charity after having to cancel a visit.

She had hoped to attend the launch of The Clore Art Room at Barlby Primary School in London.

In a message read out at the school on her behalf, the Duchess said she was 'truly sorry' to have missed the launch.

Others receiving awards at the ceremony today included head coach of the Wales rugby team Warren Gatland who was awarded an OBE, the headteacher of Wellington College Sir Anthony Seldon who received a knighthood, and former football referee David Elleray who received an MBE.

During the ceremony, William chose not to stand on a riser  as he wanted to make it more comfortable for the recipients, according to a royal spokesman.

Hyperemesis gravidarum afflicts one in 50 pregnancies and is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.

The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.

Pregnant mothers expecting twins are often more likely to suffer the condition, due to the higher levels of hormones in their system.

Miss Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline 'twice the hormones' often means 'twice the sickness'.

She said: 'The condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

'It is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body, where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother.

'If anything it is associated with a normal, healthy pregnancy. Every so often, in extreme cases it is necessary to scan the mother to see if she could be expecting twins.

'In twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones, and so often twice the sickness.'

She said the condition is usually diagnosed around the six week mark and in most cases carries on until 12 weeks.

'The majority of ladies feel much better after 12 weeks, but a small group do carry on suffering the symptoms well into their second trimester, up to 24 weeks,' Miss Hanna told MailOnline.

Hyperemesis gravidarum leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients. Sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.

They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.

This can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.

Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.

In less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration, medication and nurtrients. Some women take vitamin B6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant. Others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine, which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective.

Sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea. If they cannot keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip.

Miss Hanna said Kate is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum, having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with Prince George.

She said: 'If you have suffered this condition before, it is more likely you will again.

'If you have already reacted once to the raised hormone levels in the way she has, it is quite normal during subsequent pregnancies.'

She said in most cases pregnant women are given advice to avoid spicy foods and eat a diet of bland food including toast, bananas and mashed potato, little and often.

'Women suffering the condition are at risk of dehydration and so we often advise they keep their water levels up and avoid fizzy drinks,' said Miss Hanna.

'For the majority of women these simple measures will make them feel better, but in some more extreme cases we would prescribe anti-sickness medication, something like Stemetil or Maxolon (metoclopramide).

'If, despite everything, the expectant mother is not keeping anything down, and is suffering bloating, they are often taken into hospital where they can be closely monitored, given regular fluids and more regular anti-sickness drugs.

'In very extreme cases, steroids can be given.'

Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause serious complications for mother and baby.

Those who are hospitalised, as the Duchess was with Prince George, before 12 weeks are around 20 per cent more likely to be at risk of pre-eclampsia, according to some studies.

But Miss Hanna, who has 35 years of experience and has been a consultant for the last 25 years, said the risk of any complications for Kate is reduced given the fact she did not experience any during her first pregnancy.

She told MailOnline: 'She did very well during her first pregnancy, and as a result there is no reason to think anything will be different this time around.

'Second pregnancies are kinder and easier on the body, because the body has done it before.

'Kate will know what to expect and there is no reason she will face any complications.
