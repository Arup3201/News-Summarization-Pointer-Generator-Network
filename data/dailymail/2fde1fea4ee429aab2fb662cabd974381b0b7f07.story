A new app claims to be able to turn an iPhone into a 3D camera and lets users view images simply by moving their phone or mouse.

The Seene app, created by London firm Obvious Engineering, then takes a series of pictures and maps them onto to the model to give the effect of 3D.

Once created, the images can either be viewed on a phone or a PC, where moving the mouse causes them to change perspective.

The Seene app maps a number of photos onto a model to give the illusion of 3D when a user moves their phone

'The world isn't flat, and with Seene, neither are your photos,' the firm says.

'Seene creates a new kind of shareable 3D photo that brings together image, depth and movement in a way that is both familiar and new.'

The ‘Seenes’ are images mapped onto a rough 3D model of a subject 
that give the feeling of being able to shift perspective even after 
a person has photographed it.

When a Seene is created, a series of dots appear on 
the images, showing the perspective points the app can see to build its 
3D model - the more there are, the better.

It then asks a user to take a series of photos of the subject by moving the phone around.

These images are then mapped onto the model, creating the seene.

When a user moves their phone, it appears that they look around the object.

The vision startup, based in London, aims 'to help smart devices to better connect with and understand the world that they see,' which is free from the App Store.
