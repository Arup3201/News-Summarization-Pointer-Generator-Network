The 'house mom' from University of Oklahoma's disgraced Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity said she's 'heartbroken' about being portrayed as a racist after being caught on video chanting the n-word.

Beauton Gilbow, 79, released a statement on Tuesday after a Vine video emerged from February 2013. She appeared to be laughing and singing at a party, repeating the 'n-word' seven times on camera.

Gilbow said in her statement she was singing along to Trinidad James' All Gold Everything, as Buzzfeed earlier reported. However at no point does the song used the n-word seven times in a row.  

Her statement read: 'I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news. I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist.

'I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life. 

'I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week.'

Daily Mail Online was also waiting for comments from the fraternity's national headquarters and the University of Oklahoma.  

The fraternity was closed by University of Oklahoma on Sunday after footage was posted online of members  chanting the n-word, referencing lynching and indicating that black students would never be admitted to their chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

The video appeared to have been taken on a charter bus, with at least one of the chanting, young men wearing a tuxedo. 

It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. 

University President David Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with the racism.

OU Unheard, a black student group on campus, posted a link to the video after someone anonymously called it to the group's attention on Sunday afternoon.

In an interview on Monday with 9 News, 'frat mom' Gilbow denied every seeing racism at the frat house and said she had never heard the racist song.  

Her longtime friend and former OU coach Barry Switzer also told the station in an emotional interview that he didn't believe that members of SAE were involved and that the racist chanting was down to a few freshman who didn't live in the house yet. 

Gilbow lost her job after the frat closed along with the frat's chef, Howard Dixon. A fundraising page for Mr Dixon has raised close to $34,000 as of Tuesday.

National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said late on Sunday that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter. The national group said it was ‘embarrassed’ by the ‘unacceptable and racist’ behavior.

On Monday, University President Boren said he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning viewing the racist video.

Boren said members had until midnight on Tuesday to remove their belongings from the fraternity house. He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming,’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions.

And now a sorority at the beleaguered University of Oklahoma is being investigated over their involvement in the racist incident. 

In the video, at least one woman can be seen in the back of the bus clapping her hands along with the vile chant.

As of Monday night, the woman has not been identified, reported NBC News, but the national office of Delta Delta Delta sorority, also known as Tri Delta, released a statement online saying that it was 'cooperating fully' with the university’s investigation into the matter.
