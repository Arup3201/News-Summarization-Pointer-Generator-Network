WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange made his first public appearance for two months today as he taunted the US government by giving a speech from a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London..

The 41-year-old gave a relaxed seven-minute statement demanding President Barack Obama end America's 'war on whistleblowers' and call off its FBI investigation of the leak of tens of thousands of diplomatic cables.

Assange, who British security sources said would be arrested if he put one 'toe' outside the Ecuadorian embassy, appears to be relishing his position as political asylum seeker, having been holed up for two months as he seeks to avoid extradition from Britain.

The Australian began his balcony address by declaring: 'I am here today because I cannot be there with you today' - referring to his asylum bid which has become costly and embarrassing for the British government.

Controversial: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange made his first public appearance in two months yesterday to demand the American government's 'war on whistleblowers' must end

Outspoken: He also said he had taken a 'stand for justice' and praised the 'courageous South American nation' of Ecuador,which has granted him political asylum

Worried: During the seven minute speech, he said: 'As WikiLeaks stands under threat so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our democracies'

Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak

Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador  on Thursday as he seeks to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over sexual misconduct allegations.

The WikiLeaks founder has been trapped in the embassy for almost two months without having been seen or heard from.

Hundreds of his supporters had gathered 
to listen to the Australian as well as vast amounts of global media. 
There was also about 100 police officers.

Assange made his speech from the safety of a small balcony at the Ecuadorian embassy knowing that if he stepped foot outside he would be arrested.

During the speech, he said: 'I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks.

'The United States must dissolve its FBI. investigation. The United States must vow that it will not seek to prosecute our staff or our supporters.'

'The US must pledge that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the powerful.

'There
must be no more foolish talk about prosecuting any news organsations. 
The US administration's war on whistleblowers must end.'

He also hailed US Army intelligence officer Bradley Manning, the man who allegedly handed over the documents to WikiLeaks, as a 'hero' and called him 'one of the world's foremost political prisoners.'

Grateful: Assange praised the 'courage' shown by the South American nation's president for granting him asylum

Assange said that WikiLeaks' work was helping to defend the world from the tyranny of world governments and the secrets they keep.

'As WikiLeaks stands under threat so does the freedom of expression and the health of all our democracies.

'We must use this moment to 
articulate the choice before the government of the U.S. Will it revert 
to the values it was founded on or will it launch off the precipice 
dragging us all into a dark, repressive world in which journalists live 
under fear of prosecution.

During his speech he also thanked Ecuador for granting him asylum.

He said: 'I thank President Rafael Correa for the courage he has shown in considering and granting me political asylum.'

He also offered an apology to his family, saying: 'To my family and my children who have been denied their father, forgive me. We will be reunited soon.'

It also emerged today that Assange has instructed his lawyers 'to carry out a legal action' to protect his rights.

His legal adviser Baltasar Garzon 
emerged from the Ecuadorian embassy in London before Assange spoke and said: 
'I have spoken to Julian Assange and I can tell you he is in fighting 
spirits and he is thankful to the people of Ecuador and especially to 
the president for granting asylum.

Fighting back: Julian Assange's legal adviser Baltasar Garzon, pictured, said today that Assange has instructed his lawyers to carry out legal action to protect the rights of himself and WikiLeaks

'Julian Assange has always fought for truth and justice and has defended human rights and continues to do so.

'He demands that WikiLeaks and his own rights be respected.

'Julian
Assange has instructed his lawyers to carry out a legal action in order
to protect the rights of WikiLeaks, Julian himself and all those 
currently being investigated.'

Assange shot to international prominence in 2010 when his WikiLeaks 
website began publishing a huge trove of American diplomatic and 
military secrets - including 250,000 U.S. embassy cables that highlight 
the sensitive, candid and often embarrassing backroom dealings of U.S. 
diplomats. 

As he toured the globe to highlight the disclosures, two women accused him of sex offences during a trip to Sweden.

Outside the embassy today, Crowds chanted slogans such as 'I am Julian', 'Julian Assange freedom 
fighter' and 'Only one decision, no extradition' as Mr Assange came on 
to the balcony wearing a blue shirt, burgundy tie and dark trousers.

Militants from anti-capitalist movements such as Occupy and 'hacktivist' group Anonymous were present.

There was also a significant contingent of South American supporters chanting slogans in Spanish.

They carried placards with messages such as: 'You Won't Stop WikiLeaks -
They Changed The World Already' and 'Free Press Free Assange'.

Tristan, an unemployed 29-year-old, has been camped out in front of the 
embassy since Thursday to show his support for Mr Assange and WikiLeaks.

Protest: Supporters of the WikiLeaks founder hold placards as they demonstrate outside the Ecuadorian Embassy yesterday

Solidarity: There was a huge presence of Assange supporters outside the embassy

'I will be staying here for as long as it takes,' he said after the speech.

'I would like for the British Government to let him (Mr Assange) go to 
Ecuador or Sweden if the Swedish agree to their original terms and give a
guarantee he will not be extradited.

'He has already asked the Swedish authorities to come here to 
investigate, he is willing to defend himself against the allegations.

'All he wants is an assurance he will not be extradited to America just for exposing the truth.'

Laura Mattson, a 29-year-old supporter from London, said she had been greatly impressed by Mr Assange's words.

Asked whether she thought Mr Assange should face the accusations against
him, she said: 'Is it about the charges or is it about silencing 
WikiLeaks?

'I think these allegations are just a way of getting to him.

'I used to take WikiLeaks for granted but now things are getting very serious and I feel I must take a stand,' she added.

Last
night, the diplomatic row over Julian Assange escalated when the 
President of Ecuador warned Britain that any attempt to storm its 
embassy in London would destroy relations between the two countries.

Keeping watch: Police officers stand outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London yesterday before Mr Assange spoke to the Press

Warning: Ecuador's President Rafael Correa warned Britain off storming its embassy during his weekly broadcast in Loja

Rafael Correa used his weekly address
to the nation to deliver his strongest warning to Britain yet, 
describing the UK’s stance as ‘grotesque’ and ‘intolerant’.

He said if British police ‘violated Ecuador’s diplomatic mission’ in London it would destroy ties between the two countries.

Mr
Correa said: ‘The United Kingdom threat would be breaking the law and 
encroaching on our embassy. I don’t know who they think I am or what 
they think our government is. But how could they expect us to yield to 
their threats or cower before them? My friends, they don’t know who they
are dealing with.’

The 
comments are likely to be welcomed on the streets of Ecuador, where 
anti-colonial feeling runs high. Meanwhile, the country’s position is 
attracting growing international support.

Assange has been trapped in the embassy for almost two months without having been seen or heard from.

Britain
is adamant the WikiLeaks founder should be extradited to Sweden so he 
can answer sex charges, which he denies. But Assange and his supporters 
claim he should be allowed safe passage to Ecuador because its 
government has already granted him political asylum.

Assange, whose leaks have proved embarrassing for the US government, fears that if he is forced to return to Sweden he will be extradited to America, where his life could be in danger.

Last week, Ministers threatened to strip the embassy of its diplomatic status so police could storm it and arrest Assange. Sources believe the chances of that have diminished but insist Assange will be arrested if  he leaves the building.
