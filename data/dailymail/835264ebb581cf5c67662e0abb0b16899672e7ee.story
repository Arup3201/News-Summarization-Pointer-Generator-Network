Friends: Kirstine Hamilton, who has a ten-year-old daughter with former partner Neil Trotter

Kirstine Hamilton's romantic honeymoon in Mexico was rudely interrupted by the news that her former partner, Neil Trotter, had scooped £108million on the lottery.

But with great grace, the very new Mrs Hamilton showed no bitterness on learning that her ex had suddenly become one of the richest men in Britain.

Instead, she sent him a joking text message: ‘That’s just typical of you, Trotter.’

The pair, who have a ten-year-old daughter together, are said to remain on good terms despite their split several years ago.

Mr Trotter yesterday said that he planned to use his fortune to buy country mansions, sports  cars and designer handbags for his new girlfriend.

But he appeared amused when asked if he would be buying his ex-girlfriend a house – and explained that she and her husband were rich enough already.

He said: ‘She’s just married. He’s in Formula 1. I think he’s in charge of all the radios and things like that for Bernie Ecclestone. They are well off and live just up the road from me.

‘Her mum texted her. She was pleased – she said, “That’s just typical of you, Trotter.”’

Mrs Hamilton, who will turn 41 at the weekend, attended Purley High School for Girls in South London, close to where her ex-boyfriend went to school.

The couple are believed to have broken up not long after their daughter Annabelle was born, and Mr Trotter has been with his new partner Nicky Ottaway, 33, for eight years.

Mrs Hamilton has also moved  on, and a few months ago she left the semi-detached home in a cul-de-sac in Caterham, Surrey, where she is believed to have lived with Mr Trotter during the time they spent together.

Her parents, Keith and Christine Pitman, are also believed to have moved away from Surrey, and until recently were living at a £350,000 red-brick semi-detached house on a country lane in the village of Chiddingstone Causeway, Kent.

Pictures posted on Mrs Hamilton’s Facebook page last month show her in a white wedding dress and kissing her new husband, in full morning dress, surrounded by their friends and family.

Another picture, apparently from later that evening, shows her in a blue dress clutching a celebratory glass of champagne.

And it’s clear it’s not just the former partners who remain close – since Mr Trotter’s stepmother organised some of the flowers for the wedding reception.

Mrs Hamilton posted a picture of the display on Facebook, with the comment: ‘Big thank you to Brenda Trotter for our lovely table flowers xxx.’

As for Annabelle, their daughter, Mr Trotter admitted that he plans to buy her a pony following his extraordinary win.

It’s nearly as good a gift as the one he will be getting himself – an extravagant country house with plenty of space in its garage for a fleet of supercars.

Mr Trotter said yesterday that he had no plans to marry Miss Ottaway, his girlfriend of eight years - even though she has already quit her job to live a life of luxury with him.

The couple from Coulsdon, Surrey, both resigned after he became Britain’s fourth biggest Lottery winner ever by scooping Friday’s EuroMillions jackpot.

And they insisted they had no worries about the huge win affecting their relationship.

But Mr Trotter, who is a successful amateur racing driver, admitted he was not thinking of spending his winnings on a lavish wedding. He said he did not want to ‘rush into’ marrying his long-term partner in case he ‘regretted it later’.

Mr Trotter said: ‘We are quite happy. We’ve spoken about it before, but we are quite happy to just go the way we are going. It wouldn’t really make any real difference. If you rush into something you would regret it later, maybe.’

His girlfriend, who is a keen rider, said she expected to buy a horse and some designer shoes. ‘Nicky has an endless list, including clothes, shoes, handbags and a horse and a dog,’ Mr Trotter admitted.

Asked if she feared the money could come between them, Miss Ottaway said: ‘We would like to think that it’s not going to change us,’ but added: ‘We don’t know. We’ve never been in this situation before.’ Her partner added: ‘I’m not worried.’

Mr Trotter – who admitted he did share some character traits with his namesake, wheeler-dealer ‘Del Boy’ Trotter from Only Fools And Horses – said he would use the money to buy a country mansion with plenty of garage space for a fleet of supercars.

And in an echo of the catchphrase of David Jason’s sitcom character, Mr Trotter told his father’s secretary on Friday that he would be a multi-millionaire ‘this time tomorrow’.

He said: ‘I always knew I’m going to be a millionaire. I’m a Trotter so it’s going to happen at some stage. I have always believed, and it obviously works.’

Mr Trotter hopes to use the money to help his family and friends – and plans to buy a pony for his daughter Annabelle.

He bought his winning ticket from Londis in Wallington, Surrey, where he would stop nearly every day on his way to his car bodyshop, Chameleon Coachworks in nearby Mitcham.

He checked his numbers at 10.30pm on Friday. On finding that they all matched, he turned ‘as white as a sheet’, according to his partner.

Miss Ottaway said she did not believe him at first, and added: ‘I think I told him to shut up. It was totally unreal.’

Mr Trotter went to see his father that night to confirm he did indeed have a winning ticket before returning home to celebrate with his girlfriend and two bottles of Budweiser.

He immediately folded his business – despite having one car in his garage for repairs and another booked in for Monday.

Meanwhile, Miss Ottaway rang up her ‘stunned’ boss yesterday and quit her job as an accounts assistant at a small firm in Epsom that makes books of remembrance for crematoriums.
