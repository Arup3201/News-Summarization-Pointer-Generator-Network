A jealous Chinese woman knocked a suspected love rival unconscious before stripping her naked and tying her up before cutting off her breasts with a pair of scissors.

The horrific attack happened in city of Heshan in south-eastern China's Guangdong province when 27-year-old Xiao Lin was at home watching television when there came a knock at the door.

She later told her husband Xiao Luo, 28, that as she answered the door, someone kicked it, knocking her in the head and sending her sprawling to the floor.

A bag was then put over her head before she was stripped naked and tied up.

Horrific: Xiao Lin, 27, said she had gone to answer the door and as it opened someone had kicked it, knocking her in the head and making her fall to the floor. A bag was then put over her head before she was stripped and tied up

Her husband told local media: 'She thought maybe it was a sex attacker but it was something much worse. The attacker cut off her breasts with a pair of scissors.'

After the brutal attack the hood was pulled from her face and she 
recognised her attacker as Meng Tsao, with whom she had once worked at a
 local factor.

According to detectives who arrested Meng, she admitted carrying out the attack and said it was because the other woman had stolen her husband.

Unmasked: After the brutal attack the hood was pulled from her face and she recognised her attacker as Meng Tsao, whom she had once worked with at a local factory

Tragic: The attacker Meng has been arrested and Xiao Lin has been hospitalised where medics said it was impossible to reattach her severed breasts

However when they spoke to the husband Meng Pan, he denied that he had been in an affair with Xiao Lin.

He did, however, admit he had a crush on her - but that she had turned him down.

He said he had once told his wife that he found Xiao Lin attractive, so when he then decided to file for divorce, his wife became convinced that Xiao Lin was to blame and decided to get revenge.

Meng has been arrested while Xiao Lin is recovering in hospital where medics said it was impossible to reattach her severed breasts.
