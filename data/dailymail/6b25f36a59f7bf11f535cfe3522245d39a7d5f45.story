Why not carry your essentials around with you in a jam jar, a giant felt Rubix's Cube, or even Steinway piano?

For those struggling to make a statement
with their bag, a new and slightly out-there range of made-to-order 
bags will certainly set you apart.

The brain child of Russian brand krukrustudio, who describe the bags as ‘bag-objects’ fashion, their creations are mainly made out of felt and wool.

Berry bag: This might look like an average pot of strawberry jam, but it is in fact a rather unique handbag

It's a knockout: A bag in the shape of a boxing glove, left, and a Dalek from Doctor Who

Style solved: The eye-catching Rubix's Cube bag is made of Spanish felt and costs £98.89

Out to play: The Rubix cube bag in action, left, along with a 'house of cards' bag, which opens at the 'roof'

Ah, the humble carrot, so much more than just a vegetable: As Krukru studios prove, it can also inspire a clutch bag, £105.71

Time on your side: Let everyone you pass in the street know just how cultured you are, with a Big Ben bag, left, or violin backpack

Get patriotic: This number in the shape of a London bus costs £64.79

From a giant boxing glove and an Eiffel tower to a violin, a Dalek from Doctor Who and even the Instagram logo, the bags come in every conceivable design.

Barely a day goes by without another ‘it’ handbag being announced or seen on the arms of numerous celebrities. But with most of these costing thousands of pounds and acquiring a waiting list months long, it can be difficult to feel original.

So the customised ‘carrot’ bag or blueberry jam bag with a lid opening is one way to get noticed.

Picture perfect: This Instagram logo bag could be an ironic statement about social media - or simple somewhere to keep your lippy, £64.79

Express your love of the outdoors with either a hot air balloon bag (it unzips down the centre) or a traditional green watering can number, left

A quirky gift for a pianist: This Steinway and Sons piano bag even unzips as if you were opening up the piano lid, and has three tiny pedals

Time for tea: Though be careful as the brand point out that while felt is slightly water resistant, it is most definitely not waterproof

C'est chic: The Eiffel tower bag, left, is made with silver washable print and grey felt insets, while the 'jam' bag also comes in Blueberry and Apricot 'flavours'

The Russian pair behind the brand Lyuba and Max started selling their designs in Moscow in March 2011 and now sell internationally.

Most of their bags can be customised in a variety of colours and cost anywhere from around £60 - £120 online.
