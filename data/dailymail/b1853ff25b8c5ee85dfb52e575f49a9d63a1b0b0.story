Frankly, I don’t know whether to be mortified or flattered.

Returning from a champagne reception hosted by the ship’s captain, I discover my room attendant has lovingly folded my tatty pyjamas into an origami-style dog.

It doesn’t stop there. The next morning he knocks on the cabin door and asks if I need anything ironed, which, call me sensitive, I take to mean I look creased.

Come sail with me: A small ship is one of the best ways to see a grand sight such as the Sognefjord

It turns out that the always happy crew are one of the highlights of my cruise to the Norwegian fjords.

They even smile as they distribute sick bags on an unusually choppy crossing of the North Sea.

Discovering the fjords on a cruise that starts and finishes in the UK (in this case, Tilbury, Essex), is simpler and cheaper than an independent exploration of this otherwise expensive country - at the Bergen fish market, among wriggling lobsters and chunks of black whale meat, I spot £20 fish sandwiches and £24 prawn skewers.

I scurry back to the ship for afternoon tea which, like other meals, is included in the price. The only extras are excursions, alcohol and a £5-a-day tip.

And the 425-cabin Marco Polo, with no children or nightclubs on board, is perfectly suited to the leisurely art of fjord cruising.

Built in 1965, the ship sails under the Cruise & Maritime Voyages flag.

Her thick hull was designed to maximise stability and smash through ice. In recent years, she has sailed the Amazon, the Yangtze and most of the oceans.

Her size - she accommodates just 800 people - means I quickly get to know my fellow passengers. At lunch on the first day I find myself sitting next to a 22-year-old doing a molecular biology degree at Cambridge; the next day it’s a retired speedboat champion.

By day three my boyfriend and I have become friends with our cabin neighbours, Lowri and Justin, and our table tennis matches become a daily staple.

The ship generally spends the entire day at one location, setting sail in the early evening. The sun sets around 10pm, making it hard to keep track of time.

On several nights I head to the deck to watch the scenery slip by over a post-dinner drink and before I know it, it’s 3am.

Stepping ashore, I feel unashamedly smug whenever I glance back at the vessel, which looks positively tiny alongside other ships. Her size allows us to sail deep into the fjords. One stop takes us to the remote village of Fjaerland.

Until 1986, when a road tunnel was built, the only way in was by boat along the narrow waterway.

Fjaerland is famous for its glacier museum, one of only two in the world. A video shows the calving - where ice breaks off the edge of the flow - of a Norwegian glacier larger than Manhattan. Later we walk to the base of an icy blue arm of the Jostedalsbreen glacier — the largest in continental Europe.

In Flam village in Aurland, we slip into a tiny harbour and head for the steepest standard- gauge railway in Europe. In one hour, we whizz through 20 tunnels and past thundering, foamy waterfalls before reaching Myrdal mountain station, 863m above sea level.

One of the most surreal moments occurs on the way down, as we pause at a waterfall. Hidden speakers blast an eerie tune, and a woman dressed as a fairy from Norwegian folklore emerges from behind a boulder and starts to dance.

A city on the edge: Bergen, with its colourful Bryggen wharf to the fore, is known as the 'gateway to the fjords'

We also visit Balestrand, a beautiful village in the mountainous Sognefjord region.

The area was a favourite holiday destination of Hitler - and our guide produces a dog-eared, black-and-white photo of the Fuhrer standing on the harbourside in 1937.

The majority of land in Norway is privately owned and Balestrand locals have been offered millions by developers desperate to build hotels or ski resorts, but they’re not interested.

Vast displays of wealth are considered vulgar, our guide tells us. He introduces us to the cashier at the local co-op - who owns the mountain above us.

Our final stop is Bergen, a hilly, historic city that feels like a sprawling metropolis compared to the villages we’ve passed. We wander around crooked wooden Hanseatic houses, once the homes of German traders who arrived in the 14th century.

As we sail out of the harbour, we squeeze past a much larger cruise ship and I watch a crew member herd passengers along the gangplank.

The best things really do come in small packages.
