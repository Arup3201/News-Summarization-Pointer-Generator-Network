 

They say dog is man's best friend, but not many owners can say the bond began before they were born.

Toddler Carter and his pet Toby have developed a special relationship at their home in Indianapolis, Indiana, and become virtually inseparable. 

Parents Devin and Jake Crouch have been documenting their progress on Instagram and now have more than 5,000 followers.

Their chemistry began when Toby would curl up to Devin while she was pregnant to keep her safe, knowing 'something was going to change his world.'

A glimpse of the future? Carter's parents Devin and Jake Crouch have used the Intsagram account as a journal for the boy, and have set them up in a number of poses

Close: Mother Devin, 26, who set up the account, says: 'The bond that Carter and Toby share is absolutely incredible' 

Devin, 26, who has no previous photography experience, said: 'The bond that Carter and Toby share is absolutely incredible. 

'The first Carter and Toby photos started the day Carter came home from the hospital, when we noticed how protective Toby was over him. Toby stayed close to his new brother and would follow anyone who would hold Carter.

'We realised that the two of them would always have a special relationship and we thought an Instagram account would be a great way to document their lives together.'

The couple rescued Toby in June 2011 and Carter was welcomed to the family 16 months later.

Devin said: 'This bond between them was evident to us even before Carter was born. While I was on bed rest, Toby, who was not allowed in our bedroom at the time, would sneak up and lay at the end of the bed to make sure I was okay.

Sharing: The youngster, relaxing in the sun, offers his dog a slice of watermelon. He responds by sticking out his tongue to taste the fruit 

'He could tell that something was going to happen that was going to change his world.'

Devin says the bond between Carter and Toby only grows as time passes.

She said: 'It continues to amaze us as parents. Toby is incredibly loyal and patient, as Carter is the centre of his world.

'Carter loves his "puppy brother" and always wants to be right next to Toby. As Carter has gotten older, their relationship has evolved from Toby being his protector, to Toby being his play companion and best friend.'

Surprised: Carter looks shocked standing next to Toby in the bath tub. The Instagram account now has more than 5,000 followers 

'Puppy brother': Devin said the social media account gives them an opportunity to share their 'special moments' as well as promote animal rescue

Animal-lover Devin first started the Instagram account to shed a positive light on the adoption of animals.

But as the number of followers steadily increased, the couple decided to use the account as a photo journal for Carter.

Devin said: 'It feels great to be able to share these special moments with the world and to promote rescues.

'We look forward to giving Carter the journal so he can see the photos and incredibly kind words from complete strangers. We feel very blessed that it has given us the platform to shed positive light on the adoption of animals.'

Getting older: The pair enjoying a day out in the country run side by side. Toby was rescued in 2011 and Carter was welcomed into the family home 16 months later

Upset: Toby looks around at Carter who, despite wearing a Superman t-shirt, has started crying 

Bunny ears: The pair look at the camera from top and bottom. Devin and Jake have said their antics 'continue to amaze them as parents'
