A Sydney  siege hostage has offered to sell her first-hand account   for a 'six-figure sum' as it's revealed fellow victims could receive just $1,500 compensation - a fraction of what's available to those caught up in overseas terror attacks.

Marcia Mikhael, 42, was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15.

A lawyer for Ms Mikhael, who works as a Wespac executive, told The Australian she had a 'wonderful story to tell' and she was sitting near one of the hostages, Katrina Dawson, when she was killed in the police crossfire.

Marcia Mikhael, 42, was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15

She was one of several hostages forced to record a chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag to relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman. 

The mother of three has offered her story for a six-figure some and doesn't 'want to be insulted' with anything less, according to her lawyer Jason Arraj.

'It's got to be a win-win business transaction... so when I say I don't want to be - insulted, I'm saying I don't want a figure of $10,000 — that's not going to cut it at all,' Mr Arraj told the newspaper.

Ms Mikhael will put the money towards a foundation she wants to set up and it 'is not for the purpose of making a dollar for the benefit of Marcia herself'. 

It emerged this week that hostages caught up in the siege will receive as little as $1,500 plus costs in compensation under the NSW victims support scheme for the 16-hour ordeal, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The maximum payments for the NSW victims support scheme were cut from $50,000 to $15,000 plus costs back in 2013

While victims of terror attacks overseas can claim up to $75,000 in financial assistance under Australian federal law, the same legislation doesn't apply for attacks on home soil.

The maximum payments for the NSW victims support scheme were cut from $50,000 to $15,000 plus costs back in 2013.

Peter Hughes, who survived the Bali bombings in 2002, received federal government compensation after Prime Minister Tony Abbott backdated payments for victims of terrorist events to cover the September 11 attacks in New York.

He says the compensation has to extend to cover those caught up in terror attacks in Australia.

'It doesn't matter where the terrorism happens, it doesn't matter if it's international or it happens on our own lands, if they're Australians they should receive this help,' Mr Hughes told the Telegraph.

'It's not about the money, it's about showing that someone ­really cares and that's what I hope happens with victims of the Martin Place siege.' 

1. How did barrister Katrina Dawson die?

2. How did cafe manager Tori Johnson die?

3. How did gunman Man Haron Monis die?

4. What caused the injuries of the hostages?

5. Did the police act properly in holding off?

6. Were there explosives in Monis' backpack?

7. Did Man Haron Monis intend to die?

8. Should police have responded to Monis' demands?

9. Did anyone else know about Monis' plans?

10. What could have been done to prevent his actions?

NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard wrote to his federal counterpart George Brandis to raise the issue of compensation last month.

Mr Hazzard said it seemed strange that Australians who were the victims of terrorist attacks on home soil were not entitled to the same access to Commonwealth compensation that they would if they were travelling overseas.

The federal government will now consider extending the scheme, a spokesman for Mr Brandis said.

An inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege will open on January 29 to determine how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented.

The inquest may be held at one of Sydney's two coroner's courts - in the inner western suburb of Glebe, where Monis's body was taken following his death at the siege's end, and at Westmead 26 kilometres from the city centre.

NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required, including lawyers representing victims and police officers. 

Following his determination on what happened inside the Lindt cafe, Mr Barnes will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety.
