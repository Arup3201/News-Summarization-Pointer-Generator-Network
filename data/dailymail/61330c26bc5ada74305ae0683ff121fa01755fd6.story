She's the Perth mum who made a kitchen appliance that costs as much as a week in Bali so popular in Australia.

Former mining consultant Grace Mazur has opened up about how she turned the controversial Thermomix cooking device into a cult success - as she announced a $1 million donation to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute.

Her company sold 80,000 devices in Australia in 2014 - despite an angry backlash from customers, upset that the first model released in years, the TM5, allegedly went to market without warning. 

'It was a bit challenging,' Ms Mazur, the managing director of Thermomix in Australia, said of the incident.

The company was rounded upon by consumer group CHOICE last year after furious customers said the TM5 model was released without warning. 

A Change.org petition garnered more than 2500 signatures and some customers took the issue to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. 

Ms Mazur said it was an 'honour' that customers were so passionate about Thermomix.

'It's also an honour because we know how passionate our customers and consultants are... You learn from every experience, everything in life that you do'. 

She first discovered Thermomix while visiting a friend in her native Poland in the year 2000, when she was working as a mining consultant in Perth. 

'I went to (visit) a friend of mine... She wasn't expecting me.

'Her kids cooked the whole dinner instantly. I was impressed, they sold it to me, seeing what they can do.' 

The Thermomix is extraordinarily popular and has received positive reviews from CHOICE. But the company's behaviour has been the target of scathing criticism

After returning to Australia, she then negotiated a deal with Vorwek, the manufacturer of the product, for several months.

'It took us awhile to convince the German company. They didn't think there was a market here in Australia.'

It took years before the product caught on - with the company selling 50,000 units in its first ten years, but 80,000 last year.

The device is popular in Europe - Ms Mazur said 'in Italy, the Thermomix is part of a wedding' - and the company has had more than 200,000 customers in Australia in total.

Ms Murdoch said today's donation from Thermomix would go towards current efforts preventing childhood diseases and ailments, including food allergies, obesity and diabetes.

'Our mission is to try and re-educate people about food,' she said, adding that Thermomix had a part in that mission. 

'(Thermomix is) that easy that your kids can use it, and can be involved in the process about making decisions about what they eat.'
