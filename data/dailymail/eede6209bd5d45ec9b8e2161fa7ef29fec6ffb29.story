Hundreds of women have been inspired to take on the epic 2,600-mile Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) detailed in author Cheryl Strayed's book Wild, and its newly-released big screen adaptation starring Reese Witherspoon.

According to a spokesperson from the PCT Association, there has been a huge influx of inquiries from would-be hikers eager to follow in the footsteps of the best-selling author and attempt the mammoth trek, which stretches from the US border with Mexico up to the Canadian border.

'We've had a lot of calls from people who have said 'I've read the book and I really want to do [the trek],' the PCT Association's Liz Bergeron told NBC News.

But Ms Bergeron added that the increased number of hikers starting out on the tricky and often dangerous path has also meant an increase in the number of accidents. 

She explained: 'We are really stressing that people be prepared in order to cut down on the possibility of a rescue.'

Both Strayed's book and the recently-released movie clearly depict the dangers involved in attempting to tackle the trail; at one point the then 26-year-old former heroin addict has a close encounter with a wild bear, while another passage describes her desperate attempt to cross a treacherous snow-covered mountain without any of the proper equipment.

In fact, the novice hiker readily admitted how ill-prepared she was for her lonely adventure, which saw her cover 1,100 miles of the PCT over several months. Having packed an assortment of bulky equipment and personal items - including a number of weighty books and journals - before starting the trek, she then added a staggering 24.5 pounds of water to the weighty backpack, which she later christened 'Monster' thanks to its impressive bulk.

Strayed also braved sweltering temperatures of up to 100 degrees at some points along the trail, before being plunged into freezing conditions when she reached the mountains. 

Having walked hundreds of miles in a pair of boots that were one size too small, Strayed was then forced to duct-tape some sandals in the hopes of protecting her feet from the hazardous conditions.

And in addition to the hazardous environmental conditions and numerous problems with her equipment, Strayed also had to face the dangers posed by other hikers she met along the way. At one campsite, she fled from a pair of men who made threatening comments about her appearance and the fact that she was alone, while at another point a couple running a campsite threw her off their land because she was unable to pay their camping fees.  

But, surprisingly, none of that has stopped scores of women from wanting to experience the journey for themselves.

'After I read her book, I got the maps,' Las Vegas-based Black Jack dealer Linda Blaney told NBC. 'After reading what she went through, I knew that anybody could do the trail. 

'I found out that I'm the one person who makes myself happy.'

Jessica Reynolds, who is currently training to take on a portion of the trail this coming Spring, added that she was inspired to try her hand at the lengthy trek after her mother gave her a copy of Strayed's book. 

Inside the cover of the copy is written: 'To Jess, Love Mom. May you find your own journey.'

Star quality: Reese Witherspoon's performance in the recently-released big screen adaptation of Wild has already earned her a number of award nominations

Where it all started: Strayed first set out on the mammoth trek when she was just 26

'It makes your own personal struggles and problems seem so small,' Jessica explained. 'Starting a new life for her was finding herself on this trail and I kind of was in that same point in my life. 

'It's such an empowering story for women. It will encourage a lot of people to find themselves on a trail, hiking versus other forms of therapy.' 

Bob Mayon, caretaker at a hikers' rest stop called Hiker Town, revealed that he has seen a huge surge in the numbers of people passing through on their way to completing the PCT - and added that the popularity of the trail will likely increase thanks to the release of Wild the movie. 

'We had 700 hikers last year,' he revealed. 

Earlier this week activewear brand REI announced that it has re-released the Danner Mountain Light Cascade boot, a replica of the original footwear Strayed wore during her own hike.

The shoes, which famously appears on the cover of the 2012 book, come in 'the exact box used in 1995 when she set off to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail' and will retail for $299 per pair. 

The new shoes, a tribute to the iconic style originally introduced in the 1970s, were custom-made for Reese to wear in the movie.
