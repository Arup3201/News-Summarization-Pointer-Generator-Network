A controversial burial box which could have held the remains of Jesus' brother is to go on display for the first time since its owner was acquitted of forging its inscription.

The discovery of the 2,000-year-old ossuary, or bone box, which bears the words 'James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', was regarded as one of the greatest archeological discoveries when it was found more than a decade ago.

But the find was plunged into controversy when its owner Oded Golan was charged with forging the relic's exciting inscription in 2003.

The ossuary (pictured when it was last on display in 2002) has divided experts over its authenticity

He fought to clear his name, and after a ten-year trial, the Israeli antiquities collector was cleared and the mystery of the 'Jesus box' lives on.

The limestone box will now go on display to the public, although Mr Golan has not yet revealed where the exhibition will take place.

Typical of first century Jerusalem, the box is thought to have held the remains of James the Just, the first leader of Christians in the city after the crucifixion.

The box's owner Oded Golan fought a 10 year legal battle after being accused of forging the box's inscription

At that time Jews were laid in a cave after death, and their bones were collected a year later and placed in an ossuary of the kind owned by Mr Golan.

He told The Guardian: 'This is the oldest evidence that mentions the name of Jesus Christ.'

But despite the acquittal, some doubts remain about the box's authenticity.

The box bears the Aramic inscription, 'Ya'akov bar Yosef akhui diYeshua', which translated reads, 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus'

Professor Christopher Rollston, of the Albright Institute of Archeological Research told the newspaper that he believed the second half of the inscription was added in modern times.

Mr Golan plans to display the box alongside expert opinions from the trial, so that members of the public can decide for themselves whether they think the artifact is authentic.
