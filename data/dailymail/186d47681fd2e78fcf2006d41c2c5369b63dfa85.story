A pair of hungry thieves got a little more than they bargained for when police spotted them eating quiche in a cafe that had closed for the day.

Upon realising they had been caught red-handed, the two men armed themselves with knives and had to be talked out of the 50-seater Cafe@Marshalls in Berwick-upon-Tweed by police negotiators.

They eventually gave themselves up after five hours and were arrested for aggravated burglary.

Angela Marshall, who runs the cafe with her husband Howard, went to the scene at 1am on Monday when she heard about the stand off and was told that they just wanted some flan.

The men were eventually brought out of the cafe and arrested at 6am.

Mrs Marshall said: 'Apparently they were hungry and wanted some quiche. There was a little bit of money in the till, but I think they just wanted food and then it got out of hand.

'It obviously must be very good quiche.'

According to Mrs Marshall, there was around 15 police cars surrounding the store when she arrived shortly after 1am.

She said: 'There was negotiators and all sorts. They had riot gear on and Tasers.

'From what I can gather the men had smashed a window and climbed through it. The police were driving past and saw two lads in the cafe and called back-up.

'But when they saw the police they grabbed some knives and started threatening them.

'They were in there a long time and they trashed the cafe.'

Northumbria Police confirmed that two men, aged 21 and 20 have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary.

A force spokesman said: 'The two men were armed with knives, refused to come out of the premises and threatened police.

'After speaking with officers two men, aged 21 and 20, were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary. No one was injured during the incident.'
