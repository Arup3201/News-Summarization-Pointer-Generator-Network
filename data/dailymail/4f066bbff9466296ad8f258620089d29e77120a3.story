Two gay convicted killers have married each other in prison – with notorious terrorist Carlos the Jackal as their witness.

Serial killer Alfredo Stranieri and Germain Gaiffe – who beheaded a man – married inside the high-security prison at Poissy, near Paris.

Gaiffe, 45, wore a white wedding dress but was ordered to change into men’s clothing. Guests included Carlos the Jackal after the couple asked him to be their witness.

Wednesday’s civil ceremony is believed
 to be the first gay wedding in prison since France passed a same-sex 
marriage law two months ago.

Controversial comedian Dieudonne M’bala was
 the other witness, despite speaking out against gay marriage.

He was also asked to change out of a white wedding dress. Mr M’bala said: ‘This is the France of tomorrow.’

Italian-born Stranieri, 56, was dubbed the ‘small ads killer’ after targeting victims through classified adverts.

Alfredo Stranieri is escorted by policemen in 1999 during the investigation into his murders. He has now married his gay lover in prison

He was given a life sentence in 2003 
for killing four people and burying their bodies in his garden. Gaiffe, 
45, beheaded a man and was given a 30-year sentence in the same year.

The couple met in prison and later 
made a bizarre claim they had fathered a child with France’s 
then-justice minister Rachida Dati. Miss Dati launched a prosecution for
 ‘causing outrage to a public servant’ and the pair had four months 
added to their sentences.

Prison officials refused to reveal if Stranieri and Gaiffe would now be allowed to share a cell.

Carlos the Jackal, real name Ilich 
Ramirez Sanchez, is serving two life sentences for bomb plots in Paris 
in the 1980s and a 1975 double murder.
