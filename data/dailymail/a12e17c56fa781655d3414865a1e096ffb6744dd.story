He designed some of the most beautiful cars in the history of motoring.

Now a priceless collection of Ferraris designed by the 'Godfather of car design' have gone on display to celebrate his life.

Sergio Pininfarina was responsible for some of the Italian manufacturer's most iconic models over the past 60 years.

The Italian died in July at the age of 85 and the new exhibition, named after him, shows 22 of his models from the road and racetrack across three halls.

Models on display include the Le Mans winning 250LM and a experimental Formula 1 Sigma, which Pininfarina designed during the 1960s.

Also on show is a spider version of the Daytona model, a 1964 Ferrari 275 GTB4 and the Modulo concept, which was previously held privately in the designer's family collection.

The exhibition also includes a number of one-off concepts from the Turin-based outfit including the 'Pinin', a four-door model.

Mr Pininfarina's work was yesterday praised by James Cottingham from the respected classic Ferrari specialist DK Engineering in Hertfordshire.

He said: 'Pininfarina is probably the most famous design house used by Ferrari and Sergio Pininfarina is responsible for some of the most desirable models.

'He was very important and it is fantastic that there is an exhibition celebrating his work.'

The designer, who joined the company in the 1950s, became managing director in 1962 and then, following his father's death, chairman in 1966.

Over the next 40 years he was at the forefront of the design of dozens of exclusive Italian sports cars including Lancias, Alfa Romeos and Maseratis. He was also made a Senator for Life of the Italian republic.

Paolo Pininfarina said: 'This exhibition is the best way to honour my father and confirm the role of Pininfarina as a bearer of aesthetic values of Italian design all over the world.

'The dialectic exchange between Ferrari and a design house such as Pininfarina, today the only independent Italian coachbuilder, has helped to define the most beautiful cars of all times in an evolution that has lasted 60 years and is still going on.

'The masterpieces on display in Maranello are already part of the history, but it's in the cars of recent years that you find the expression of the consistency and continuity that result in the design of the current range and in our ongoing daily commitment to support the development of future products".
