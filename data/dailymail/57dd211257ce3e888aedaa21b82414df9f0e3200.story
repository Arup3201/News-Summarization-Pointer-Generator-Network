Poldark – the hit 1970s costume drama – is returning to TV screens.

The BBC revealed yesterday that it had commissioned a six-part series that will air next year.

The original show, which starred Robin Ellis as the dashing squire Ross Poldark, ran for 29 episodes from 1975 to 1977.

Its romantic storyline and breathtaking Cornish locations made it a domestic and international success broadcast in 40 countries.

Based on the novels of Winston Graham, it followed the fortunes of Poldark, who comes home to Cornwall from the American War of Independence to find his former life in tatters.

On his return, he discovers that his father has died, his wife Elizabeth, believing he was dead, is betrothed to his cousin and his home is overrun with livestock and drunken servants.

It was originally adapted by the BBC into 29 episodes and was then revived by ITV franchise HTV in 1996 for a two-hour sequel, set ten years after the BBC version with a different cast.

The drama is being adapted by Debbie Horsfield, whose other credits include BBC hair salon drama Cutting It.

In the story Poldark finds his late father’s estate in chaos and his wife engaged to his cousin Francis. Poldark then sets about repairing the family name but also marries Demelza, the servant girl he has made pregnant.

The saga includes Poldark’s on-going feud with the greedy George Warleggan and sees him arrested by the French for spying before he goes on to be made an MP.

The BBC unveiled the remake as part of an announcement about BBC1 controller Danny Cohen’s final drama commissions before he takes on a new job as director of television at the organisation.

Poldark is one of four new shows which also includes Our Zoo - about the man who built Chester Zoo - and From There To Here, which is set in Manchester in the aftermath of the IRA bombing of the city centre.

The BBC has also commissioned a new series from EastEnders writer Tony Jordan called Dickensian, which will bring characters from Charles Dickens’s books to life in new stories.

Danny Cohen said: ‘It has been a joy and privilege to commission programmes for BBC One.  I hope audiences enjoy the range and creative ambitions of these new dramas for the Channel.’
