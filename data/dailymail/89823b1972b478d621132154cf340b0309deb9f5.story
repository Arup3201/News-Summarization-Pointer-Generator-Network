Bridges boasting dramatic waterfalls, sweeping cycle lanes and vibrant light displays are just three of the ideas that have been submitted as part of an international competition to design a new crossing over the Thames.

Dozens of proposals have been put forward as part of the contest, which called on architects and engineers to create a creative and practical route between Nine Elms, in Battersea, on the South Bank, and Pimlico on the north side of the river.

And now Wandsworth Council, which is organising the competition, is inviting Londoners to vote on the 74 proposals to help jurors decide on which designs will make it through to the next stage of the process.

The designs, which are being showcased online and at local exhibitions, are now undergoing a detailed technical assessment. Next month, the jury panel will recommend a shortlist of up to four teams to go through to the next  stage and to develop more detailed plans.

There are currently five possible sites for the new bridge. The most likely option, according to a brief by Transport for London, will stretch from just south St George's Square in Pimlico to near the new site for the US Embassy in Battersea. 

The proposed scheme, which will cost an estimated £40million is being hailed as a much-needed transport link by officials south of the river. But is facing opposition from Westminster City Council, who argue it will be detrimental to the local environment.

Oasis: This proposed design would see pedestrians climb along the edge of a dramatic waterfall, bringing a touch of fantasy to the Thames

Futuristic: One of the bridge designs in the international competition features three separate paths that weave and curve across the river

Striking: This unusual design has a multi-coloured structure built above and alongside the cycle and pedestrian crossing

Vibrant: Massive pink spirals around the bridge would be mounted with bright pink lights - allowing the bridge to twinkle after dark

Proposed sites: The exact location of the bridge has not been chosen, but option one or option two are most likely, according to officials

Angular: This proposed design would be supported by a series of interlinking metal structures that would reach to the riverbed

Simple: This more streamlined design offers two separate routes for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid congestion along the bridge

Iconic: If the above design was chosen, the large curved structure would add a striking mark to the ever-changing landscape of south London

Sweeping: This design allows cyclists and pedestrians to enjoy winding ramps up to the main crossing, with benches incorporated on land

Sleek: This bridge extends out in a giant curve from the banks of the river, and incorporates strips of light that illuminate it after dark

Modern: This design, titled 'Crystal Bridge', will be illuminated by coloured lights embedded in the structure of the bridge after dark

Clean: This bridge design is defined by a large arch over the river, which supports suspension cables for the base below

Splash of colour: Red support pillars and beams brighten up this design, which has been submitted to the international competition

Green: This design incorporates attractive gardens dotted with flowerbeds and trees at the landing point of the bridge

Practical: This bridge ties together two elevated walkways - leaving pedestrians free to walk along the riverfront below

Two separate paths lead on to this bridge, which is built on a subtle curve and looks out on to Battersea Power Station (left)

Dynamic: This twisted bridge transforms from brown to rainbow-coloured as it stretches across to the South Bank

Stylish: It is not clear how the bridge connects to the ground in this design, but it would offer users impressive views of the city

Attention to detail: Images inset in this  design offer a close-up view of the landing points and the bridge's tension ribbon and arch structure

Seamless: Glass and metal combine to create this light and airy design, which gives users plenty of opportunity to admire the views

Sculptural: This streamlined design rises elegantly off the banks of the river - and incorporates eyecatching art installations at either end

Fluid: In this design, the bridge curves upwards from the ground to form a wide road across the water, with designated cycle routes

Minimalist: In this innovative design, the bridge is suspended over the water as if unsupported, offering unobstructed views across the city
