Number 40, Southwark Street, in south-east London is not your average Georgian house.

It's not so much the slightly unusual location, behind railings on a rather barren piece of land - more the fact that it's slowly melting.

That's because the two-floor property is actually an art installation made of wax bricks.

Number 40, Southwark Street, in south-east London is not your average Georgian house - it's an art installation made from wax bricks

Entitled A Pound Of Flesh For 50p (The Melting House), it is the brainchild of British artist and designer Alex Chinneck, who is well known for creating optical illusions

He constructed the artwork from 8,000 cast paraffin wax bricks 'cemented' between terracotta sand, which will slowly melt away over 30 days - and the structure is due to survive until this weekend

And passers-by will have to catch it while they can because it will soon dissolve into a pile of sludge - leaving just the actual roof tiles, brass door number and letterbox.

Entitled A Pound Of Flesh For 50p (The Melting House), it is the brainchild of British artist and designer Alex Chinneck, who is well known for creating optical illusions.

He constructed the artwork (whose name is a nod to a line from The Merchant Of Venice) from 8,000 cast paraffin wax bricks 'cemented' between terracotta sand, which will slowly melt away over 30 days - and the structure is due to survive until this weekend.

The house is being melted manually with heating tools used by the building trade, enabling the artist to maintain control over how it dissolves.

The artist built the house in homage to a candle-making factory that stood in the area more than 100 years ago

The installation was commissioned  as part of the Bankside Transformed - Merge Festival.

The floating market of Covent Garden

Earlier this month, Alex Chinneck created a stunning optical illusion that appeared to make a building at one of London’s busiest tourist districts hover in mid-air.

To passers-by, it looked as though a section of the historic market building in Covent Garden had broken free from its foundations and was floating unaided, high above them.

But in reality, the display, which imitated the architecture in the area, was a complicated piece of technical wizardry which took months to create.

This installation, named Take My Lightning But Don't Steal My Thunder, was created by the Alex Chinneck (pictured)

A passing couple peer inside the building which appears to be torn apart with one half suspended in mid-air with no support 

Named Take My Lightning But Don’t Steal My Thunder, it seemed as though the 184-year-old market building was torn off and levitating with a large gap between the broken ‘stone’ walls, pillars and doors.

The 12-metre-long sculpture was made from a steel frame and a type of expanded polystyrene called filcor.

It is understood to have taken 500 hours to paint using special digital techniques and was designed to resemble the existing architecture in the area.

The illusion of it floating was created by using a heavy counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hung over the bottom half.

A steel beam was hidden inside the green market stall to the side of the building and this was attached to a steel platform and a 12-metre cantilever.

In the past, using similar techniques, Mr Chinneck appeared to have turned a house upside down - also in Southwark.
