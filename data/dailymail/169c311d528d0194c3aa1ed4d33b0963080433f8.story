A convicted killer accused of clubbing his mother to death two days after he had finished serving a 30-year prison sentence sobbed as he entered a guilty plea in a New Jersey courtroom Tuesday.

Appearing before a judge without a lawyer by his side, an emotional Steven Pratt proclaimed: 'I don't want a trial. I'm guilty.'

The 45-year-old ex-convict was arrested Sunday after he allegedly killed his mother, Gwendolyn Pratt, at her home in Atlantic City after celebrating his release from prison with his family. 

Tearful confession: Steven Pratt weeps in court while answering questions from Superior Court Judge Michael Donio during his arraignment Tuesday, which culminated with a guilty plea 

Standing in an empty courtroom wearing an orange jumpsuit and a pair of handcuffs, Pratt broke down in tears after Judge Michael Donio read the charges against him, Philly.com reported. 

The judge advised the suspect not to say anything without an attorney present but Pratt brushed it off and continued speaking through sobs

'I have no lawyer,' he said. 'I have nobody.'

Upon learning that his bail has been set at $1million in cash, Pratt told the judge that it made no difference to him.

'I have nothing,' he said, his head bowed.

Before he was led away from the courtroom, the hulking former inmate murmured: 'I have failed.' 

According to prosecutors, Pratt beat to death his 64-year-old mother, Gwendolyn Pratt, during an argument that broke out at her home in Atlantic City Sunday.

Police found Mrs Pratt dead from blunt force trauma to the head at 6.30am Sunday. Just two days earlier, the victim had picked up her son from prison.

Just before Gwendolyn Pratt's killing, the family held a welcome-back party to celebrate the end of Steven Pratt's 30-year sentence for killing a neighbor with a handgun, the Press of Atlantic City reported.  

Ruan Tilghman Pugh, who lives next door, told the paper: 'It's so devastating. You just never know what people are going through.'

He said that before the attack, he had overheard Mr Pratt on the phone to a cousin asking to stay with him in the wake of an argument with his aunt.

Police arrested Pratt at the scene and charged him with murder. 

Pratt had served a 30-year sentence for the murder of Michael Anderson, a neighbor in Atlantic City whom he shot dead in 1984.

Pratt, then aged 15, was hanging around in an apartment hallway when he got into a dispute with Mr Anderson, court records show.

During the altercation, Pratt attacked Anderson with a lead pipe, but the neighbor managed to disarmed him and hit him back.

Pratt took off and then came back with a borrowed handgun, which he used to kill Anderson. He was tried as an adult.

Gwendolyn Pratt's brother told Philly.com that his sister, who worked at Resorts Casino Hotel since 1989, had been excited about her son's long-awaited release.

On Friday, she picked Pratt up from Bayside State Prison and took him out to IHOP.

A few months prior to his release, the 45-year-old inmate had reportedly turned down an offer to move into a halfway house ahead of his release, according to Press of Atlantic City. .
