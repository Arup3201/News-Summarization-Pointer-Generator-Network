A woman has told how terrorists used her as a human shield and fired through her legs during a kidnapping in Yemen that was allegedly aided by Abu Hamza.

Margaret Thompson said that she was told: ‘It’s goodbye to you’ as she and 15 others mostly from the UK were forced to stand on 3ft high sand banks during a gun battle with government forces.

She saw British hostage Ruth Williamson pushed in front by a terrorist with a rifle in her back - and fall to the floor as she was shot dead.

By the time the Yemeni army overwhelmed the kidnappers, three Britons and an Australian had been killed in the bloodbath, which took place in 1998.

Mrs Thompson, an American, spoke of her ordeal publicly for the first time last night during the New York trial of Hamza, who is accused of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone, topping it up with £500 of credit and offering to be their go-between.

He is also alleged to have helped set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, and facilitated jihad in Afghanistan. Hamza, 56, has denied all the allegations.

Mrs Thompson at times appeared emotional as she gave evidence and told how the trip to Yemen was supposed to be a two-week adventure of a lifetime.

She was living in London at the time due to her her job with a multinational IT company and booked it through British company Explore, which is popular with holidaymakers in the UK.

But as the
 group travelled in a convoy of five SUVs between the cities of Habban 
and Aden they were stopped by armed Islamists in trucks before 20 other 
terrorists jumped out from the side of the road.

Mrs
 Thompson, in her 50s, said the kidnappers had rifles, grenades, machine
 guns mounted to their vehicles and rocket propelled grenade launchers.

Mrs
 Thompson’s vehicle was at the back of the group but as they tried to 
drive off the terrorists, who belonged to the extremist Aden-Abyan 
Islamic Army, started screaming at them.

She
 said: ‘I thought they were firing them into the air but it sounded like
 the bullets were hitting metal so we thought they were hitting the car.
 We fell towards the floor as low as we could get’.

Ruth Williamson, from Edinburgh, and Durham university lecturer Peter Rowe were among the four hostages killed as Yemeni security services tried to end the kidnapping in 1998

As the kidnappers drove all 16 tourists away Mrs Thompson said that ‘we were very quiet, we were very scared. We were looking at each other out of the corners of our eyes but there was no conversation’.

The
 group were taken to a remote area of the desert where the leader of 
their captors asked them why they thought they were there as one of his 
soldiers played with a grenade to intimidate them.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘He said: "It’s not your fault that your countries bombed Iraq. You are going to be safe, everything is going to be OK. We have friends in prison and we are going to keep you until they are released".'

The hostages slept in their sleeping bags out in the open overnight and by the next morning they could hear distant gunfire as the Yemeni forces got closer.

Mrs 
Thompson said that they were led out to the sand dunes and made to stand
 ‘with our arms up’ as one of the kidnappers addressed them.

She said: ‘He said: "It’s goodbye to you." I hoped it meant that they were getting ready to release us but I feared it meant we were going to die’.

By now the gunfire was much closer and the hostages were led to a nearby ravine before being brought back to stand on the dunes.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘The gunfire was more constant than it might have been earlier. It was coming both from towards and behind.

‘From behind a number of the kidnappers were lying on their stomachs against the (dune) shooting their guns between our legs. The gunfire sounded very close. I heard the whizz of the bullets in the air as it passed us’.

The group were on their way to the coastal city of Aden when they were taken hostage

The confrontation then reached its horrific conclusion.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘At that point another kidnapper grabbed (hostage) Mary Quin by the back and had a gun in her back and at that point he began pushing her forward, running across the open area between the first and second (dune)’

Two other terrorists did the same with Miss Williamson, 34, an NHS employee from Edinburgh, and Catherine Spence, an Australian.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘For the three that were being pushed forward each of them had a kidnapper behind her with a rifle in their back. The one that had Mary Quin was in front and the other two were further back, in a triangle formation’.

Mrs Thompson watched as all three went over another dune - but only Mrs Quin came up immediately.

At that point Mrs Thompson was shot in the left leg and fell to the floor with an injury which would leave her with a shattered pelvis.

But then the Yemeni forces arrived and bundled everyone into helicopters and flew them to hospital.

As she lay on a stretcher on the aircraft Mrs Thompson could see at her feet the dead bodies of teacher Margaret Whitehouse, 52, from Hook in Hampshire, and Peter Rowe, 60, a university lecturer from Durham.

The Australian who died was Andrew Thirsk, 35 - Miss Spence was his wife and she survived.

Hamza is said to have offered to be the kidnappers’ go-between as well as helping them with the satellite phone.

Prosecutors say that among the ‘friends’ they all wanted freed was Hamza’s son-in-law Mohammad.

Today the court is due to hear from Mrs Quin, who flew to London in 2005 to confront Hamza at the Finsbury Park Mosque in London where he used to be the imam.

Hamza, who has stumps for arms after losing them fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, is also due to give evidence if the prosecution concludes its case.

The trial continues.
