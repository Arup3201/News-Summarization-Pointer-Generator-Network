England coach Peter Moores has urged Alastair Cook to ‘stay strong’ as he tries to bat his way out of the worst drought of his 105-Test career.

Cook’s latest attempt to register an increasingly elusive 26th century will begin on Thursday at Lord’s, where England take on India in the second Investec Test following the bore draw at Trent Bridge.

The England captain has now gone 25 innings – and 16 months – without reaching three figures, and made just five in his only innings on Nottingham’s featherbed before being bowled round his legs and off his thigh pad by seamer Mohammed Shami.

That left Cook to issue a familiar refrain – in part aimed at England fans, in part aimed at himself – about the importance of getting his side off to a good start. ‘I’ve got to believe the wheel will turn at some stage,’ he said on Sunday evening, almost as if the act of repeating the hope was more likely to make it come true.

But there is no appetite among English cricket’s upper echelon for regime change, and it was unsurprising to hear Moores’s conviction that Cook would eventually come good.

‘It was an extraordinary dismissal,’ he said. ‘You maybe get one of those in a career, two if you are unlucky. To get one when you desperately need a score is tough. I hope that’s the end of it for him now and he gets a few breaks.

‘He has been through this situation before. That is what makes great Test players: they can ride through it and come back strong. He will be very keen to put his mark on Lord’s. He is a top-flight player. He has to stay strong.’

As Moores pointed out, this is nothing new for Cook. Between March 2008 and February 2009, he went 27 Test innings without a hundred – but that sequence was leavened by 11 half-centuries, while the current drought has brought him only seven fifties and a modest top score of 72.

Then, in 2010, Cook began the summer with 106 runs in eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, before securing a last-minute spot on the plane to Australia with a battling 110 against the Pakistanis at The Oval. Just as well: Cook’s Ashes would net him a memorable 766 runs.

Even during India’s last visit here, three years ago, Cook took a while to warm up. The first two Tests at Trent Bridge and Lord’s produced scores of 12, one, two and five. Then came a monumental 294 at Edgbaston. In other words, all is not lost.

His batting, of course, is only the half of it. England have not won any of their last nine Tests, and Cook’s worth as a tactician remains in the balance after the horror show at Headingley, where Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was all but ushered towards 160 by some negative field placings.

Moores, though, insisted he had seen signs of progress. ‘What I have been impressed with Alastair is that, during a really tough time for him, he has grown rapidly as a captain and person around the team.

‘I thought his captaincy in Nottingham was exceptional in a tough game. There was no time off, there was no right or wrong in the field – we saw that with the last-wicket partnerships.’

Whether conditions at Lord’s will assist Cook’s attempts to end England’s winless spell is another matter. The Test there against Sri Lanka last month yielded almost 1,500 runs, and one of groundsman Mick Hunt’s famous flat ones is expected again this week.

Nothing new: Cook has struggled before, notably against Pakistan in 2010

Asked whether he had spoken to groundsman at the venues for the remaining four Tests in this series – Lord’s, the Ageas Bowl, Old Trafford and The Kia Oval – in the hope of avoiding a repetition of the Trent Bridge fiasco, Moores replied: ‘We do it all the time. Preparing pitches is not an exact science, people know what we want, but whether we get that or not...

‘There is a theme at the moment – and it is not one we particularly like. If it is a wicket with bounce in it, we back ourselves.’

The worry, though, has to be that England’s prize seamers will eventually crack under the strain. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad bowled 113 overs between them in Nottingham. If India win the toss on Thursday and bat first, England’s new-ball attack may begin to wonder whether this five-match series will ever end.
