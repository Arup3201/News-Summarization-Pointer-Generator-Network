A schoolgirl in so much pain she became hooked painkillers by the age of 14 has spoken of her ordeal - and how she got her life back on track.

Louiselle Morris, from Cardiff, was 13 when her crippling back pain was diagnosed as scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine.

She was given a morphine-like drug for the pain, but soon became dependent on it to get through the day.

It was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that Louiselle, now 20, has learned to deal with the pain without medication.

Louiselle Morris (with mother Susan) was given a morphine-like opiate for her excruciating back pain, but by the age of 14 was relying on four tramadol and eight paracetemol a day

Her problems began at the age of 13 when she went to the doctor with what she thought was a common cold.

Instead, she was shocked to learn that her back was severely bent and she was suffering from scoliosis. She was told that left untreated, it could lead to fatal heart and lung problems.

Her spine had a 48 degree curve and there was a risk that her rib cage could shift and move her internal organs.

The only treatment for the chronic condition was a high risk operation where two metal rods would be stuck into her spine and then fused solid.

But her condition was borderline and doctors also refused to operate because she was in too much pain.

Within months, she was suffering from chronic pain and could not walk more than 50 metres or go to school without collapsing.

Her mother Susan, 499, said: 'Three months after she was diagnosed, Louiselle had changed. She had gone from being a typical, active teenage girl to living life as an 80-year-old woman, confined to the four walls of her bedroom.

'She would try walking around, lying on her back and on her front, but nothing helped.'

Doctors prescribed Louiselle a strong painkiller, Tramadol, to cope. The drug is similar to morphine and is only used as a short term answer to chronic pain.

Yet she was so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four Tramadol and eight paracetemol every day.

Her mother said: 'She was in a terrible state, it was horrendous.

'She lost so much confidence and I was desperate. I tried everything to get her off the medication.

'To see her in so much pain was so scary. I would have driven to the end of the world to try and help her.

'I felt so let down by the people who should have helped me. How could they leave a child to get into this state? How could they allow a teenage girl to become reliant on drugs?'

Louiselle said: 'I was sleeping and I just didn't see a way out of it. I couldn't see how the situation was going to resolve itself.

'I was just trying to cope with the here and now and that was the only way I could at that time.'

Her mother added: 'By the time I found a clinic that could help Louiselle, I was at breaking point.

'I remember speaking to the clinic, Scoliosis SOS, who understood everything I was saying. They knew how I felt as a parent and how traumatic it could be for the child involved.'Â 

They drove six hours to the clinic with Louiselle doubled over in pain on the back seat of the car. Four days after the consultation, she was put on an intensive exercise therapy course, comprising six hours of strengthening and stretching each day for four weeks.

She was also prescribed individual physiotherapy treatment and taught more about scoliosis and the effect it has on the body.

Louiselle said: 'I was going through withdrawal because I had been taking so many tablets. It was one of the worst pains you can imagine.

'My whole body felt like it was turning in on me, it was absolutely horrendous.

'I was throwing up violently for about a week and had nausea and muscular cramps.'

It was only thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy that Louiselle, now 20, has learned to deal with the pain without medication

By the end of the second week of therapy, Louiselle was off the painkillers.

Her mother said: 'Tramadol is so highly addictive and the person taking it has to want to stop, or else you haven't got a hope in hell.

'We got her down to one tramadol a day. Stopping her take the last one was such a battle but she realised how important it was to stop. She said to me, "right, it's going to go in the bin".'

Louiselle said: 'The exercise therapy changed my life. I have no idea where I would have been if my mum had not found the centre when she did.

'I could not do anything and my whole life was just slipping away from me.'

Her pain had been caused by an imbalance of the muscles and after her muscles had been strengthened and stretched, it had almost disappeared, from excruciating to a dull ache.

She returns to the clinic every two months for a 'top-up' session and instead of numbing the pain with drugs, she now exercises or takes a hot bath to ease her aching back.

Louiselle said: 'I can now manage a day without feeling like I've been hit by a sledgehammer. 'My
school attendance was erratic and I couldn't walk more than 500 metres.
Since the physiotherapy I can go to university and to work without 
being in too much pain.

'The clinic has given me the confidence 
to believe in myself. I feel like I am in control again and scoliosis no
longer rules my life.'

Doctors at the clinic have since told the 20-year-old that her back looks better than it would have if she'd had surgery.

Louiselle returns to the London clinic every couple of months for a two-hour session with a highly qualified specialist to review her progress and keep her on track.

She is now studying psychology at Cardiff Metropolitan University and wants to help other young girls.

She said: 'I have loved every second of university and I really do put my happiness down to these exercises.

'I don't feel like a hunchback anymore. I am normal and I can finally look forward to my future.'
