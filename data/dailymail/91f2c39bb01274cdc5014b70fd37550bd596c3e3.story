If you want to keep chatting away while you order your morning flat white - then it's going to cost you.

At least that's the view taken by one Australian cafe manager, who has imposed a 50-cent 'talking tax' on customers who refuse to get off their phones while at the counter.

Luke Proust from Bella Natural Food Co on the New South Wales Central Coast decided enough was enough after dealing with one-too-many rude patrons, so he put up a Post-It note at the counter announcing a new policy.

New policy: Luke Proust from the Bella Natural Food Co on the New South Wales Central Coast has won a legion of fans after posting this note at the front counter

Not on my watch! Bella Natural Food Co manager Luke Proust says it's common courtesy to put away your phone at the counter

The note, which has received hundreds of likes and shares since being posted to Facebook, reads: 'Fifty cent surcharge for being on the phone at the counter. It's rude!!'

The feisty barista has told the MailOnline that after one particularly bad morning of dealing with rude customers he felt compelled to act.

'My boss said “you had better write a sign”, so I wrote it on a Post-It note.

'He (the customer) didn't take it too well, in fact he walked out without his coffee, he said that I was being rude by charging him without having a sign.

'I said being on the phone and not engaging with me was the rude part of the deal.'

Luke Proust's sign has received all sorts of attention - and most of the customers have gotten behind his push to ban rudeness at the counter

Legion of fans: Some customers have even donated 50 cents to the tip jar so they can stop and take a picture of the epic sign

Mr Proust said that experience wasn't isolated.

The cafe manager says he has several customers on any given morning who will be too busy on their phone to even make eye contact or show basic manners when placing an order.

'You get half a dozen people in every day who are super rude on the phone,' he said.

'But if anybody has worked in the customer service industry, you can't do customer service if the customer's not willing to reciprocate.'

Some customers are less than impressed with the 50c surcharge; one even phoned the cafe personally to complain.

Natural delights: The cafe's customers have gotten fully behind the new initiative, except for a couple of disgruntled folks

'The reaction has been huge. Every single person who comes into the shop finds it great.'

But Mr Proust says the response to his campaign against rudeness has been overwhelmingly positive, with some even donating 50c to the tip jar so they can take a photo of the sign and share it with friends.

'The reaction has been huge,' Mr Proust added.

'Every single person who comes into the shop finds it great.

'It's just awareness raising – most people will step away, get off their phones and apologise once I point out what they're doing.

'Most people are OK with it.

'Obviously if someone is on an important call, we've got regulars who come in, then we understand that – it's fine.'
