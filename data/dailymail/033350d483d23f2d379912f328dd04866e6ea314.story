A New Hampshire state lawmaker has called a Democratic congresswoman 'ugly as sin' and said that her opponent is one of the most attractive women in politics.

Representative Steve Vaillancourt, a Republican from Manchester, compared U.S. Representative Annie Kuster to a drag queen in a clueless blog post on NH Insider last week.

He explained that he was inspired to write the post after hearing 'some polling data which went by too fast for me to write down' and which he later could not track down on Google.

The poll revealed that 'an attractive candidate can have as much as a seven to ten point advantage over a less attractive (or even an unattractive) candidate,' he wrote.

Clueless: Rep. Steve Vaillancourt, pictured, called a Democratic congresswoman 'ugly as sin' in a blog post

A candidate needs to be attractive to win, but can't be 'so drop dead gorgeous as to intimidate those watching', he explained.

He then asked what this might mean for Kuster's re-election race against her opponent, Republican Marilinda Garcia, in New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district in November.

'Let's be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven't offended sin,' Vaillancourt wrote. 

But by contrast, 32-year-old Garcia, is 'one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere, not so attractive as to be intimindating [sic], but truly attractive', he wrote.

He said that Garcia is so attractive that Democrats have struggled to find a bad picture of her. 

'If looks really matter and if this race is at all close, give a decided edge to Marilinda Garcia,' he wrote. 

Cruel: He said Rep. Annie Kuster, pictured left, looked more like a drag queen than most men in drag. By comparison, he said that her Republican opponent Marilinda Garcia, right, was 'truly attractive'

But he doesn't stop there. He then tells a bizarre story of a 'rather attractive drag queen' whom he saw outside a bar named Mados during a recent trip to Montreal and said he thought of Kuster, 58.

'By now you probably know why I think of Annie Kuster whenever I walk by Mados,' he said. 'Sad to say, but the drag queens are more atrractive [sic] than Annie Kuster.' 

He concluded: 'Annie Kuster looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag.'

He seemed to be aware that his disgusting comments might upset a few readers as he had prefaced the comments with a warning, saying: 'The subject matter, although very real, may prove uncomfortable for some of my more sensitive readers.'

Kuster's campaign has declined to comment on the blog post.

But Garcia said the 'sexist' comments 'have absolutely no place in political discourse'. 

'Both Rep. Kuster and I have experienced this unfortunate reality of being a woman in politics,' she said in a statement, CBS said.

'I hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country, people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look.' 

Leader: Kuster, right with a supporter, was elected to New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district in 2013

Fan: Marilinda Garcia (pictured) should win November's race if looks have a part to play, Vaillancourt said

Readers of the blog apparently had the same stunned reaction. Beneath the post, they lambasted his rant, branding him a 'bully' and calling for his resignation.

'You never mentioned qualifications for either women,' one said.

Vaillancourt has refused to say if he stands behind his comments.

The lawmaker is no stranger to controversy. In 2012, he was forced to publicly apologize for saying 'Sieg Hiel' and giving a Nazi salute during a heated floor exchange.

Although one recent independent poll by WMUR puts Garcia ahead, Kuster has long been leading the polls, results show. Kuster, a mother-of-two, was elected to office in 2013.
