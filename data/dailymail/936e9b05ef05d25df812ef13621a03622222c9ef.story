A man has been charged with the 
murders of two elderly women found dead in their homes within hours of 
each other, police said today.

Andrew Flood, 43, is accused of 
killing Margaret Biddolph, 78, and Annie Leyland, 88, who were both 
found dead in their homes in Southport, Merseyside.

Both women were asphyxiated, post-mortem examinations confirmed.

Mrs Biddolph's body was found at her 
house on Lonsdale Road on Tuesday, and Mrs Leyland was found dead at her
home in nearby Birch Street in the early hours of Wednesday.

Flood, a taxi driver, also of Southport, will appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court in Bootle later today.

A police spokesman said: 'Merseyside 
Police has charged 43-year-old Andrew Simon Flood, of Clifton Road, 
Southport, with the murders of 78-year-old Margaret Biddolph and 
88-year-old Annie Leyland.

'Flood is also charged with robbery in connection with an incident in Janes Brook Road on Saturday, February 18.

'He has been remanded in custody to appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court this morning.'

Both victims' families issued short statements through Merseyside Police last night.

Mrs Leyland's son, Philip, said: 
'Firstly, I am co-operating with the police to help them carry out their
duty and I would appeal to anyone with information to come forward.

'Secondly, I ask to be left alone to grieve quietly and to come to terms with what has happened.'

Investigation: Forensic officers were examining the home of Margaret Biddolph after her body was found inside

Alex Biddolph and Anne Pearson, the 
son and daughter of Mrs Biddolph, said: 'We as a family would like to 
thank the members of the public who have assisted the police with their 
inquiries.

'We would also urge anyone with any information that could help the police with their investigation to get in touch.

'The media are asked to respect our privacy and not to approach us directly at this time to allow us to grieve over our loss.'

A neighbour described Mrs Biddolph as a 'quiet, lovely woman' who she would often see tending her garden.

Marianne Lott, who lives opposite Mrs Biddolph's home, said: 'She was very jolly and independent.

'She was in her 80s but that didn't stop her getting taxis out and about to get groceries or do some shopping.'

Mrs Lott said her neighbour had been a widow for 40 years and had three grown-up children.

Mrs Biddolph is believed to have lived in Lonsdale Road, where officers found her body at 5.20pm on Tuesday, for 36 years.

A neighbour of Mrs Leyland said: 'She was the sort of person who kept herself to herself.'

Another neighbour said: 'It's a bit of a shock. It's not something that you expect.'

Mrs Leyland, also a widow, was described by neighbours as very frail and reliant on a walking stick to move around.

She is believed to have worked as a 
catalogue model in her younger years and, after retiring, took regular 
foreign trips with her husband, Eric, until his death in 2005 at 83.

A neighbour of Mrs Leyland said she 'was always made up to perfection.'

Mary Wright said: 'She had been quite ill but it didnâ€™t stop her.'
