HUNCHBACK: King Richard III

Richard III is finally to receive a burial fit for a king – more than 500 years after  he was killed in battle.

Remains that archaeologists believe are those of the king  are to be buried in Leicester Cathedral if DNA tests prove that the bones are his.

The skeleton was uncovered last month in what is now the car park of Leicester City Council’s social services department.

The site was formerly a chapel.

The body in the car park has an arrow in its back – matching Richard’s death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

It also has scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – tying in with  the famous description by Shakespeare and others of the monarch as a hunchback.

If the tests are positive, the king will then be given a  burial inside the Cathedral,  the Ministry of Justice announced last week.

The decision comes after  rows between MPs as to where Richard – the last English monarch to die in battle – should be laid to rest.

Some said he should be given a state burial in Westminster Abbey because he was a reigning monarch.

Others said the remains should be buried in Worksop, South Yorkshire, the centre of the Plantagenet monarch’s kingdom.

But in a parliamentary answer, the Government settled for Leicester Cathedral, a stone’s throw from the car park.

Jon Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester South, said: ‘This is really good news.

Richard III has been lying in Leicester  for 500 years – it seems only appropriate that he should be buried in Leicester.

'It will be  a boost for tourism to the city.’
