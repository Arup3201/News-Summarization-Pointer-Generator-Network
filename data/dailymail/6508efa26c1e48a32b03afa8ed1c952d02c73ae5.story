Legendary illusionist David Copperfield disappeared from many people’s radar over the last few years, but he’s gearing up for a major comeback.

He’s just signed on for three more years with a new show at MGM Grand, plus they’ll be naming a theater in his honor.

The veteran entertainer also has a string of recent behind-the-scenes movie credits under his belt and a second life in real estate, most notably with the chain of 11 Bahamas islands he’s now turned into an exclusive Caribbean resort.

For my next trick: Master illusionist David Copperfield, here with his fiance model Chloe Gosselin, is set to make a comeback. But did he ever disappear?

‘The island experience is the creation of every great place I’ve ever been combined with the imagination that I have in my theater work,’ Copperfield said in a recent Forbes interview. ‘People on the cover of your magazine come there a lot.’

The resort, for which Copperfield paid $55 million and put in an additional $35 million in renovations, has been visited by Oprah Winfrey, John Travolta, and Sergey Brin, among others.

The resort counts among its staff a crew of macaws which are specially trained to clean debris from the beach, a movie theater that magically appears on the beach, and a James Bond inspired spy game for guests.

Islands of Copperfield Bay, as it is known, charges an astonishing $37,500 per night, but Copperfield is pulling in plenty of income elsewhere, as well.

In addition to his personal Bahamas compound, Copperfield boasts a 4-story Manhattan penthouse that overlooks Central Park and houses his collection of 300 antique arcade games.

Copperfield lives in Las Vegas with his model fiance Chloe Gosselin, with whom he has a 3-year-old daughter Sky.

He’s been performing sold out shows at MGM Grand there for 13 straight years with ticket sales topping $4 billion.

He’s now signed on for three more years and the hotel’s Hollywood Theater will be renamed for in his honor.

He’s been working on his new act for years and says to expect big things.

‘Jurassic Park -sized magic,’ he calls it.

He’s also made some recent contributions to film. His is the creative mind is behind the movie magic in 2013’s The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, starring Steve Carrell, and this summer’s Now You See Me, starring Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.

‘Our goals are exactly the same,’ Copperfield told the Las Vegas Sun of his growing relationship with Hollywood films. ‘We make dreams come to life.’

Meanwhile, the avid collector of magical memorabilia has never stopped amassing his treasures and will continue using the items in his acts.

Dedicated: Copperfield has also quietly been amassing more magic memorabilia. His collection has cost him upwards of $200M and includes the world's largest Harry Houdini museum

His magic collection—which Copperfield says he spent $200 million on—is widely considered the best in the world and includes the largest museum of Harry Houdini collectibles anywhere.

Copperfield has also collected a new friend for his new act—a green robot named Atilla that will assist him with certain tricks.

The money-minded magician hopes one of those tricks will be to create a whole new younger following and even has t-shirts, toys, and children’s books in the works should Atilla become a hit.
