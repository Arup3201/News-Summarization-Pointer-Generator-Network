Les Dennis is feeling blessed. A year ago, facing his 60th birthday and unhappy with work, his wife advised him to make a wish list of things he wanted to achieve and three have come true.

Says Les, 'I wrote "join a soap" - I wanted to be in Corrie – and I am! I was also keen to move out of London and we're now in Cheshire. And the West End stage was on the list and I got a role in the musical Spamalot! It's absolutely amazing.'

The Spamalot song Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life could be his theme tune and the former Family Fortunes host says he always tries to be cheery when things seem bleak.

Les says that he is a really happy place having found his dream role and finding true love, he has completely overcome his past daemons

Like after his car-crash appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2002 during his split from wife Amanda Holden – he was sad and emotional on camera – which saw him branded 'Les Miserable'.

'Big Brother wasn't my finest hour,' says Les. 'I did it for a career boost but it didn't work out like that. But I believe if you stay positive and ask the Universe, things will come to you.'

And they did, in the shape of Ricky Gervais, who gave Les a role – as an exaggerated version of the downtrodden character the public had seen on CBB – in his comedy series Extras.

'I encouraged Ricky to go as far as he wanted with the character because I didn't see myself as this sad loser. Extras changed the public's perception of me hugely. I'll always be grateful to him for giving me that chance,' he says.

Les says that his most embarrassing was on his first day: 'The first thing I had to do on Corrie was run out of Gail's house chased by Kylie (far right). But instead of jumping into my own bashed-up van I got into  a shiny Mercedes belonging to one of the crew! We had to film it again, but as it was my first time on set, hopefully it can be forgiven!'

Now Les can't believe he's in the show he watched from its start in 1960. Les, who'd become fed up with touring in theatre productions when he got the call to audition for the role of Corrie crook Michael Rodwell, says, 'I have to pinch myself – it's the ultimate job.'

He adds that all his showbiz experience counted for nothing when he ventured onto the show's most iconic set. 'When I filmed my first scene in The Rovers Return I felt overawed. It was one of the most nerve-racking things I've done.'

Last week, Les's character Michael came face-to-face with his burglary victim Gail as part of a restorative justice scheme – and they're set to strike up a relationship. Could he be Gail's fifth husband? 'Maybe I could be one that lasts – Gail could use some luck!'

Les met his wife Claire, a life coach 18 years his junior, in 2005. They had daughter Eleanor in 2008 and son Thomas in 2011.

In between, the pair married. It was 'third time lucky' for Les, who has a grown-up son, Philip, from his first marriage to Lynne Webster, and split from his second wife, Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, after she cheated on him with actor Neil Morrissey.

Says Les, 'I'm an eternal optimist and a romantic, so I had the chance to get it right. I feel so settled and happy and blessed. I have a wonderful woman who looks out for me.'

Cats or dogs? Both! We have two dogs -Lhasa Apso-poodle crosses called Buster and Dizzy -as well as a cat called Libby.

Holidays, America or Europe?  I love the Dordogne in France -we rent a gîte there every year.

Pizza or pasta? Pasta's my  favourite but I haven't had it for ages as I'm not eating wheat as part of a 5:2 diet. I miss it!

Goodfellas or The Godfather?  The Godfather. I still get nervous  at the really tense bits.

Audi or BMW? I have an Audi A5 - I like reliable cars, not fancy ones.

Rugby or football? Football -I'm  a massive Liverpool fan.

Outdoors or sofa? I walk and walk. It's when I can think about stuff.
