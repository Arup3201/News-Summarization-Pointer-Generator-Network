George Osborne's name has a 'toxic' effect on voters when it is attached to the Tories' economic strategy, a poll has found.

The public largely backs the Coalition's strategy to reduce the deficit and cut spending – until the policy is attributed to the Chancellor himself, the survey suggests.

When researchers from Ipsos MORI asked voters if they agreed that deficit reduction should be the priority – the  Coalition's strategy – 52 per cent agreed.

Days before next week's Budget, a new poll reveals voters are more supportive of the government's economic plan until they find out George Osborne is the architect

Just 41 per cent backed kickstarting 'growth' through increased spending and temporary tax cuts, a plan favoured by Labour.

However when voters were told Mr 
Osborne was the author of the policy to tackle the deficit, support for 
the strategy plunged to 37 per cent.

Even among Conservative supporters, 
backing for the flagship deficit reduction policy dropped by five points
when told it was Mr Osborne's idea.

And when informed that Labour's Ed 
Balls, shadow chancellor, was behind a separate argument for more 
spending, 53 per cent swung in behind the strategy, a lead of 16 points.

Pollsters questioned 1,009  voters between March 9 and 11.

Mr Osborne has emerged as the least popular Chancellor since the 1990s.

The Ipsos/Mori survey showed how voters had different reactions to the two economic policies when they were told that Mr Osborne and Labour's Ed Balls were responsible

Overall, Labour's poll lead has grown 
to 13 points since last year's 'omnishambles' Budget where Mr Osborne 
had to ditch ill-conceived policies such as taxes on caravans and 
pasties. Labour has the support of 40 per cent and the Tories 27 per 
cent, their lowest since January 2003.

Conservatives are privately warning 
that next Wednesday's Budget could be Mr Osborne's last as Chancellor if
he delivers a repeat of last year's disaster.

Yesterday Grant Shapps, the Tory party
chairman, tried to reprise the spirit of the Thatcher government, 
saying he wanted the Tories to be the party of enterprise and 
aspiration: 'I believe that at our best we are always on the side of 
people that work hard and get on in life.'

Only one in four (26 per cent) think Ed Balls and Ed Miliband would do a better job at managing the economy

Mr Osborne is also coming under 
pressure from Tory MPs to cut taxes – and a further extension of the 
fuel duty freeze is expected – while the Liberal Democrats are calling 
for more spending to stimulate growth.

Mr Balls' apparent popularity has 
surprised Conservatives, who just this week were told by their campaigns
guru Lynton Crosby to try to exploit the tensions between him and 
leader Ed Miliband.

The poll yesterday found that most voters still blame Labour for the state of the economy.

David Cameron has repeatedly targeted Labour's Ed Balls in the belief that he is unpopular with voters because of his role under Gordon Brown

Britain's political elite is a bunch of 'interested amateurs' with little or no business experience who have 'generally never run anything', the British Chambers of Commerce boss said yesterday.

In a stinging attack, John Longworth, director general of the respected business lobby group, slammed the lack of corporate experience within the Cabinet.

Mr Longworth, a former Asda executive and entrepreneur, said: 'We have a political class in the tradition of the interested amateur. In many cases having little or no experience of business, and who have generally never run anything.

'That ensures they are at the mercy of the mandarins of the civil service – just like the Chinese emperors whose actions were constrained as they tried to rule.'

Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, has two decades of business experience and Vince Cable used to be the chief economist at Shell.

But the Prime Minister worked in public relations and Chancellor George Osborne is a career politician.

A Department for Business spokesman said: 'Ministers across Government speak to businesses every day of the week to understand how we can help them grow and succeed.

'There is extensive business experience in the Cabinet, specifically amongst ministers in the Treasury and Business Department.'

And just one in four believe Labour 
would do a better job. Pollsters said Mr Osborne's lack of popularity 
may not be personal, but down to the public blaming whoever is in power.

Bob Duffy, of Ipsos MORI, said: 'It is
also true that George Osborne has the lowest rating of any Chancellor 
since Ken Clarke back in the mid-1990s. But then he probably doesn't 
expect to be popular right now with the economy in the state it is, and 
the cuts continuing.'

The economy is the number one issue for voters, ahead of immigration and Europe.

Most are pessimistic, with only 18 per
cent believing the economy will improve in the next year, while 48 per 
cent think it will get worse.
