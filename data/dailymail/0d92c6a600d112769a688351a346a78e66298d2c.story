Louis van Gaal believes his Manchester United team will not improve until they learn to be more disciplined.

The United manager faces Everton at Old Trafford on Sunday without nine players and is preparing to throw defender Paddy McNair, 19, into the Barclays Premier League fray once again.

Van Gaal’s attack-minded team have scored nine goals in three games since the likes of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao arrived at the end of the transfer window but continue to look vulnerable at the other end of the field.

Angel di Maria has been a revelation for United in attack but Van Gaal wants greater defensive contribution

Asked how long it will be before United contribute a complete, 90-minute performance, Van Gaal said: ‘You never know because it’s a question of time.

‘You will see in the first half against QPR, also in the first half in the last match, very attacking and creative football. But I want to improve that we don’t lose the ball so easily. That is our problem, not our defence.

‘We are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline.

‘So we are looking for a balance - without thinking too much of only attacking but also guarding.’

Much has been made of United’s injury problems at the back and the fact Van Gaal did not spend heavily on a world-class central defender in the summer.

Radamel Falcao is yet to score in three Premier League appearances so far for Manchester United

But he added: ‘I want my defensive organisation to be better but the defence begins in the striker’s position. The media are writing that the problems are because of the weak defence and I have explained I want to improve your knowledge of football also.

'It’s team work so when we concede a goal, it’s not only because of an individual error in the defence. It starts somewhere else and that we have to analyse and improve.

‘All the teams are scoring goals out of counter-attacks mostly against us and free-kicks and corners. They don’t make their goals like we do out of building up, first, second, third and fourth phase.

‘That’s the difference and when you want to be a big team you have to perform like that.’

Failure to dominate possession has been a United problem for a few years, even stretching back to Sir Alex Ferguson’s time at the club.

Last season, meanwhile, Everton beat United twice in the league, the second game proving to be David Moyes’s last before he was sacked in April.

In the absence of defenders Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling, McNair will continue alongside Marcos Rojo at the back, getting the nod ahead of Tyler Blackett because he is right-footed. Marouane Fellaini is back in the United squad but is unlikely to start.

David Moyes' last game in charge of United was his second defeat to former club Everton in April
