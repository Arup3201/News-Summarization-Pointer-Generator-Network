Tragic: Ben Cowburn, 18,was found dead in December 2010

A popular TV comedian dedicated a performance to a teenage boy who had killed himself just months after allegedly being ‘groomed’ by the star.

An inquest has heard the gay comedian ‘took advantage’ of Ben Cowburn after introducing the fashion student to his ‘hedonistic lifestyle’, involving parties fuelled by alcohol and drugs.

But despite the serious nature of the accusations against the comedian, he was referred to simply as ‘Mr X’ during the inquest after the coroner backed an informal agreement to protect his name.

An MP criticised the decision last night and said the public should be concerned if there are ‘deals being done behind closed doors preventing basic facts coming into the public domain’.

The inquest heard that the teenager was showered with gifts and promised a job by the celebrity, but spiralled into depression after falling out with the star, who left him feeling ‘belittled and humiliated’.

When their relationship ended Ben, 18, was left feeling ‘dirty and used’ and was admitted to a mental health hospital, where he killed himself.

Months after the teenager’s death, the comedian posted an affectionate message on the internet in which he named Ben and dedicated a show to him.

Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon made the decision to protect the star’s identity after talks with lawyers representing the NHS and the Cowburn family.

They decided that it would be unfair to name the star as he had not been questioned, cautioned or arrested by the police, despite them being aware of the allegations. He was not asked to give evidence to the inquest.

Criticising the move, Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Nobody should be going down the legal route to prevent the disclosure of basic facts around a court hearing.

‘The public need to know that key evidence and key facts are not being kept from them.’

The inquest last week heard how the older man had crept into bed beside Ben after a late-night party, later engaging in a sex act.

At another party the teenager was persuaded to strip by a group of men and groped before a partygoer intervened. In a statement to the inquest, Ben’s twin sister Sophia said that the family had ‘concerns’ about him being ‘groomed by Mr X’.

Scotland Yard was made aware of allegations that Ben ‘may have been the victim of a serious sexual assault’. But after interviewing nurses involved in his care, the Met decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’.

The talented student first met the star in a pub after he moved to London from his family home in Truro, Cornwall, to study at the Fashion Retail Academy, founded by billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green.

When David Cameron visited the college in 2010, Ben asked him a question and in his first year he was chosen to attend a lunch with Sir Philip.

The comedian was unavailable for comment yesterday. The inquest continues today.
