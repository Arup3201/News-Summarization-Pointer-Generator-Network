Two of the guns found at the scene of a recent Mexican drug cartel shoot out- where a beauty queen was found to have both fired at military officers and been used as a shield- were a part of the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal.

CBS News reports that two of the guns that were found at the scene of the fatal shooting in Sinaloa, Mexico last month can be traced to Fast and Furious exchanges, as one was purchased by an American agent involved in the case and another was brought in by a suspect.

The closest link was obviously the FN Herstal pistol found near the shooting site that had previously been bought by Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent George Gillett, who was the assistant special agent in charge of the bureau’s Phoenix outpost.

Dangerous beauty? Maria Susana Flores Gamez, the Mexican beauty queen killed in a shootout between suspected drug traffickers and soldiers, likely fired a gun during the clash in the Pacific coast state Sinaloa, a federal prosecutor said

CBS spoke with Mr Gillett, who still 
works for the ATF, and he said that as an avid and informed gun 
collector, he was sure to go ‘above and beyond’ the legal requirements 
when he checked the immigration status of the man he sold the so-called 
‘cop killer’ gun to months before the shooting.

That particular model of pistol is considered a ‘cop killer’ because so many Mexican drug cartels use it against police.

The second questionable weapon found 
near the shootout had been trafficked by Uriel Patino, a man who had 
long been considered a suspect in the Fast and Furious case.

Much of the attention surrounding the 
fatal shooting that left three dead had been paid to Maria Susana Flores
Gamez, the 20-year-old Mexican beauty queen, who federal prosecutors 
believe fired a gun during the clash.

Authorities had previously said that 
Flores Gamez was likely used as a human shield and that an automatic 
rifle had been found near her body on Saturday, November 24.

Federal prosecutor Enrique Fedegrino said Tuesday that tests indicate there was gunpowder residue on her hands.

Flores Gamez, crowned 2012 Woman of 
Sinaloa in February, came out of the car first with a gun in her hands 
with the other gunmen hiding behind her, according to the attorney 
general's office.

The slender 5-foot-7-inch brunette had
competed with seven other contestants for the more prestigious state 
beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win.

the Miss Mexico title, whose holder represents the country in the 
international Miss Universe pageant.

Mexico's Ximena Navarrete was crowned Miss Universe in 2010.

Local media outlets have continually to misidentified Flores Gamez as Miss Sinaloa.

The organizers of the Miss Sinaloa 
pageant issued a statement on the pageant's Facebook page, seeking to 
make clear Flores Gamez was not their queen.

The misidentification 'damages the image and tranquillity of our queens, their families and friends', the statement said.

Neither the state nor national pageants responded to requests for comment on Flores Gamez's death.

'A lot of young women are attracted by
the false riches of the drug gangs. They offer the fantasy of a life of
riches without much work,' said Judith del Rincon, a women's rights 
activist and former Sinaloa legislator. 'A lot of beauty queens wind up 
as girlfriends of some narco.'

Sinaloa state prosecutor Marco Antonio
Higuera said Flores Gamez was traveling in one of several vehicles that
engaged soldiers in an hours-long chase and gun battle. He said two 
other members of the drug gang were detained.

The shootout began when the gunmen 
opened fire on a Mexican army patrol. Soldiers gave chase and cornered 
the gang at a safe house in the town of Mocorito.

Some men escaped, and the gun battle 
continued along a nearby roadway, where the gang's vehicles were 
eventually stopped. Six vehicles, drugs and weapons were seized 
following the confrontation.

Higuera said Flores Gamez's body has been turned over to relatives for burial.

It was at least the fourth documented case of a beauty queen or pageant contestant becoming involved with Mexican drug traffickers, the theme of the critically acclaimed 2011 movie Miss Bala, or Miss Bullet, Mexico's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of Academy Awards.

The film tells the story of a young woman competing for Miss Baja California who becomes an unwilling participant in a drug-running ring, finally getting arrested for deeds she was forced into performing.

In real life, top Sinaloa cartel drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman married local beauty queen Emma Coronel, who later crossed into the United States to give birth to twin girls in 2011.

In 2008, former Miss Sinaloa Laura Zuniga was stripped of her crown in the Hispanoamerican Queen pageant after she was detained that year on suspicion of drug and weapons violations.

She was later released without charges.

In 2011, a Colombian former model and pageant contestant was detained along with Jose Jorge Balderas, an accused drug trafficker and suspect in the 2010 bar shooting of Salvador Cabanas, a former star for Paraguay's national football team and Mexico's Club America. She was also later released.

'A lot of young women are attracted by the false riches of the drug gangs. They offer the fantasy of a life of riches without much work,' said Judith del Rincon, a women's rights activist and former Sinaloa legislator. 'A lot of beauty queens wind up as girlfriends of some narco.'

Del Rincon added that the involvement of drug lords with beauty queens dates back at least to the heyday of the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix drug gang in the 1990s.
