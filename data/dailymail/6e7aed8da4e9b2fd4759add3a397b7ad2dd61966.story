The crisis in Iraq could push up petrol prices by 4p-a-litre, heaping pressure on hard-pressed families and threatening to derail the economic recovery.

The escalating violence has sent oil prices spiralling to a nine-month high of $115 a barrel – raising the prospect that this will soon be felt on forecourts across Britain.

Uncertainty over oil supplies from Iraq, which accounts for nearly four per cent of the world’s production, came amid fresh signs that the army is losing its battle with the terror group Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

As US Secretary of State John Kerry travelled to the Middle East to warn the region was at a ‘critical moment’, it emerged the ruthless fanatics had captured two border crossings and four towns.

Fuel retailers warned the crisis would lead to higher prices at the pumps in Britain with motorists facing a ‘difficult summer ahead’.

Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ‘We see maybe another 2p added […] initially and then, over the next couple of weeks maybe 3p or 4p.’

The average price of a litre of petrol currently is 130p, with diesel at 135p.

Chancellor George Osborne last week warned the Cabinet that the conflict could wreck the economic revival by driving up oil prices.

His intervention that Britain’s vital interests were at stake was seen evidence he believed Britain should support American military action in Iraq.

His aides played down suggestions he was in favour of military options, but a Cabinet colleague said: ‘George’s comments were that we have to appreciate the seriousness of the consequences for us.

‘He reminded us that we already faced consequences with the hike in oil prices.’

Economic analysts said the global economy could be plunged into fresh decline if oil prices continue to rise.

Capital Economics warned of an ‘ugly’ worst-case scenario, in which Iraq’s production of 3.3million barrels a day is significantly disrupted, sending oil soaring to $140 a barrel.

Some 90 per cent of Iraqi oil comes from the largely Shia south of the country, which has so far been unaffected by the lightening offensive from ISIS.

But Sunni militants could spread chaos using terrorism, as they did by sabotaging a key pipeline in the northern province of Anbar in March.

Yesterday the Islamist extremists seized captured the Turaibil border crossing with Jordan and the al-Walid crossing with Syria after government forces retreated.

It followed the fall of the towns of Qaim, Rawah, Anah and Rutba, all in Anbar province, since Friday. The gains could help ISIS transport fighters, weapons and other equipment to different battlefields.

Sunni militants on Sunday captured two border crossings, one along the frontier with Jordan and the other with Syria, security and military officials said, as they pressed on with their offensive in one of Iraq's most restive regions

The offensive appeared to be part of a march toward a key dam in the city of Haditha, the destruction of which would damage the country’s electrical grid and cause major flooding.

The Iraqi army responded by deploying 2,000 troops to protect the dam.

Speaking in Cairo, Mr Kerry warned ISIS’s ‘ideology of violence and repression is a threat not only to Iraq but to the entire region’.

Calling it a ‘critical moment’, he urged Iraq’s leaders ‘to rise above sectarian motivations and form a government that is united in its determination to meet the needs and speak to the demands of all of their people’.

Washington is refusing to heed the Iraq government’s calls for US airstrikes against insurgents to help deal with the crisis.

US president Barack Obama wants a new government in Iraq, without Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who he blames for endangering the country by launching a crackdown on Sunnis, before authorising military action.

But Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the prospect of US intervention in Iraq, saying Washington’s main intention was to keep Iraq within its own sphere of power.

Dismissing talk of sectarianism, he said: ‘The main dispute in Iraq is between those who want Iraq to join the US camp and those who seek an independent Iraq.’

He said the US aimed to ‘bring its own blind followers to power’.

Khamenei’s anti-US remarks weaken the possibility, raised last week, that the two old enemies could co-operate to tackle the conflict.
