Coffee chain Caffe Nero is to remove a poster from its branches that shows three men leering at a woman’s behind after customers complained it was sexist.

The large illustration depicts two of the men lifting their sunglasses to peer at the backside of a lone woman as she walks by.

Bosses at Caffe Nero – Britain’s third largest coffee-house chain with 500 cafes – say the image was supposed to ‘portray Italian culture’. But they now concede it may cause offence, and say it will be removed from all stores as soon as possible.

Caffe Nero plans to remove dozens of these 'sexist' posters, which show three men ogling a woman in the street

A Caffe Nero branch. Chiefs say they have removed the offending poster after complaints it was sexist

Teacher Laura Palmer, 32, was visiting Caffe Nero in Ashford, Kent, with a group of new mothers when she spotted the print. She said: ‘I think it’s a really inappropriate image, which in my view promotes sexual discrimination and the sexualisation of women. It has undertones which are almost creepy – three guys standing by the side of the road in a pack with their eyes obviously drawn to the woman’s behind. I decided to complain.

Foaming with anger: It had been claimed the poster portrayed everyday Italian life - instead it was accused of 'everyday sexism'

‘I was extremely shocked to be faced with such blatant leering at women. It just isn’t the sort of image Nero should be promoting.’

Writer Laura Bates, founder of the online Everyday Sexism Project which records women’s real-life brushes with sexism, said it was only right that the chain was taking the matter seriously.

She said: ‘Some people will dismiss this as being a very minor issue, but behaviour like this is something that impacts on the lives of thousands of women and girls up and down the country. Being harassed in the street isn’t a harmless compliment – it can be scary, uncomfortable and have a real impact on women’s lives.’

However, Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said he could not really understand what all the fuss was about. He said: ‘I have never had anyone come to me with an issue like this – and I have to admit that I don’t think the general public care that much.’

In an email response to Ms Palmer’s complaint, a customer service worker for Caffe Nero said: ‘This is one of 1,000 images we use in our stores, designed to portray Italian culture. But I can see how this might cause offence, which was never intended.’

Caffe Nero spokeswoman Ceri Aiken said: ‘We have stopped actively using this image, meaning it is no longer used in new stores, or existing stores given a refresh. We are also in the process of removing the image from stores where it is displayed.’
