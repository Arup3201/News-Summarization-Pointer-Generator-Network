The deaths of a mother and her two children in Darwin could be a double murder-suicide, police say.

The owner of a Freshwater Road property in Jingili made the 'horrific' discovery on Saturday morning after finding the badly decomposed body of a 46-year-old woman about 50m from the house.

The bodies of the children, a boy, 11, and girl, seven, were found inside a tent just metres away on the half-hectare property.

Police were called to the Freshwater Road property in Jingili at 10am on Saturday where they found the body a woman, 46, boy, 11 and girl, seven

Two knives found at the scene are undergoing tests but police would not confirm if they were the weapons used in the deaths.

'We're considering this could be a triple murder. We're also very conscious of the fact it could be a double homicide and a suicide,' Detective Acting Superintendent Lee Morgan of the NT Police major crimes squad said.

Police are waiting on autopsy results expected to be completed within the next 24 to 48 hours to determine the cause of death.

Supt Morgan said it is now believed the deaths could have occurred as far back as Tuesday.

'Given there was some serious decomposition of the bodies, we'd probably put it between Tuesday afternoon and Thursday lunchtime,' he said.

Police have established the mother did not have any known contact with anyone after Tuesday afternoon.

Supt Morgan said there were no suspects yet.

He said the children had different fathers, neither of whom are suspects.

Police said they were investigating if the deaths were a triple homicide or a double homicide/suicide

'With three people deceased we are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness and we will spend the next few days here doing everything we can,' Supt Morgan said.

'Three deaths, we're definitely going to say it was suspicious. There was no one else on the block at the time.'

Neighbour Juliet Castanares said the area was quiet but she noticed the property's wheelie bin had not been moved since rubbish collection day on Wednesday.

'I noticed the rubbish bin. That it hasn't been put away. I saw the bin on Wednesday and it's still out there,' she said.

'It's a bit worrisome. Now that I know about it I'm a bit scared.'

Police are urging anybody with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
