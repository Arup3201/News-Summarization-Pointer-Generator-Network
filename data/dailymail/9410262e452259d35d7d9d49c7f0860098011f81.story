A four-floor sprawling apartment situated in one of the country's largest Grade-I listed Georgian mansions has been put on the market for just £75,000.

The apartment, which has four rooms, is part of the exclusive Patshull Hall, in Staffordshire, and is significantly cheaper than the current average price tag for a home in Britain.

However, despite its stunning location, the property has gone on the market with an affordable guide price because it is only half finished.

The apartment, situated in the Grade-I listed Georgian mansion Patshull Hall, in Staffordshire (pictured), has gone on the market for £75,000

The low starting price of £75,000 for the four-floor, four-room apartment is because it is half finished and requires additional renovation works

The apartment has four rooms, most of which are interconnecting, but these could be transformed into separate en suite bedrooms

With a long driveway through the manicured grounds of the estate to reach the apartment, the property is surrounded by beautiful parkland and appears stunning from the outside.

However, the inside is work in progress, with painting, decorating and basic refurbishing required before it is the finished article for its next owner.

The apartment spans over four floors and has four interconnecting rooms, which could be transformed into en suite bedrooms.

To reach the apartment, there is a long driveway, with a private courtyard and secure gated access.

Patshull Hall is considered one of the largest listed buildings in the country and the property dates back to 1730.

The stunning mansion was designed by architect James Gibbs for Sir John Astley and the house replaced an original moated 13th Century manor house in a medieval deer park. 

The property requires some refurbishment, including painting and decorating before it is the finished article for its next homeowner

Ron Darlington, of CP Bigwood, said: 'The price  reflects the fact it is an auction and the buyer will have to spend money to make it liveable'

The estate was acquired in 1765 by Sir George Pigot upon his retirement as Governor of Madras.

Pigot then had England's finest landscape architect, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, to landscape a grand 340 acre park including a lake in the grounds.

The mansion has been used for various different purposes over the years, including a rehabilitation centre in the 1940s and an orthopaedic hospital.

The sprawling estate was broken up in 1990 and many of the acres were sold off to create Patshull Park hotel and golf course.

It has been used as a wedding venue until the company collapsed and now the property is being sold off for accommodation.

Ron Darlington, partner at auctioneers CP Bigwood, said: 'The apartments have been there for some time but this one is not finished.

'The price of £75,000 reflects the fact it is an auction and the likely buyer will also have to spend money to make it liveable.

'It is a unique property and is a chance to live somewhere stunning.

'Somebody will probably buy this for themselves as opposed to be looking to sell it on.'
