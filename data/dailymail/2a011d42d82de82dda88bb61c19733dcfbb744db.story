Wasps will aim for a winning send-off from Adams Park on Sunday that would also keep them in European Champions Cup quarter-final contention.

Wasps' 12-year stint in High Wycombe ends after their Pool Two appointment with Castres.

When they resume Aviva Premiership business against London Irish in eight days' time, it will be at their new Ricoh Arena base in Coventry.

But Wasps rugby director Dai Young knows there can be no distractions from the task of aiming to stay in touch with group pace-setters Harlequins and Leinster.

'The players are fully focused on the 80 minutes of rugby ahead of them on Sunday, but we appreciate it will be a significant occasion for our supporters, as well as a significant game of rugby,' Young said.

'It would be nice to sign off at Adams Park with a great performance and a great win. It would be a fitting way to thank our fans for the support they've shown there over the years.

'This a huge match for us in Europe.

Director of rugby Dai Young says his Wasps are ready for a significant occasion and match 

'We were really pleased with the bonus point win in the south of France last Sunday (Wasps beat Castres 32-17), but we know the job is only half done.

'An away win last week means nothing if we don't back it up on Sunday.

'Castres have some really good individual players, and if it clicks for them they could be really dangerous.

'Coming into these two European matches, I always said we would need to win both to have a realistic chance of progressing.'

While Wasps can afford no slip-ups, the same can be said for twice European champions Munster as they prepare to tackle Clermont Auvergne at Stade Marcel Michelin on Sunday.

Clermont's 16-9 success in Limerick last weekend gave them possession of Pool One's box seat, and Munster now have it all to do in a group that also includes last season's beaten European finalists Saracens.

'It is only half-time - that is the beauty of having these back-to-back games - and we can put it right,' Munster skipper Peter O'Mahony said.

'We came up against an excellent side last weekend. We knew it was going to be tough, and we knew from the day the pool was drawn that it would be tough.

'I thought Clermont played well, but I thought we could have a done a lot of things better.

'We have to go and dominate them physically. We were bullied at times, which is not something that normally happens at home.

'But we will have had eight days to recover and put ourselves in the best position to do the job.'

In Sunday's other Champions Cup game, the Scarlets host Ulster, who claimed a bonus point victory over the Welsh side in Belfast last weekend.
