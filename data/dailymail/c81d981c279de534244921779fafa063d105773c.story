An award-winning novelist says doctors should be allowed to help terminally ill patients to die without the threat of prosecution, it was reported today.

Julian Barnes, whose wife, literary agent Pat Kavanagh, died of cancer four years ago, said: ''I've always been in favour of suicide. I always thought it was every human's right to kill yourself if you want to.'

Barnes, 67, won the Man Booker prize for his 2011 novel The Sense of an Ending about a man's investigation into the mysterious suicide of a friend.

He criticised British laws which force terminally ill patients to travel to the Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas to take their own lives - putting their families at risk of prosecution.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph ahead of the paper's sponsored Hay Festival in Cartagena, Colombia, he insisted he would rather kill himself than go to Switzerland.

'I view it is as a human right rather than
 a sort of slippery slope which will end with people knocking off granny
 because she's got a cottage that they might inherit,' he said.

The novelist claimed that 'in the good old days' doctors used to 'knock people off all the time'Â  to end the patient's suffering.

He said he had heard of a doctor who had ended the life a colleague dying of cancer with a fatal drug overdose.

Currently, assisted suicides are illegal in Britain, but a recent guidelines mean that families can escape charges if they are found to have acted purely on compassionate grounds.

Barnes, who has a new book due to be published in April, told the Telegraph that doctors should be trained how to tell families that their loved ones are terminally ill.

Speaking to writer Matthew Bayley he said: 'Doctors are really not 
trained to do it. Anyone who has had experience of hospitals knows the 
curious combination of technical brilliance and human inadequacy and 
lack of human training.'

Barnes is the latest author to back a change in the law to allow assisted suicide following demands from Martin Amis and Ian McEwan

Amis caused controversy in 2010 when he called for 'euthanasia booths' for the elderly so they could kill themselves with a 'martini and a medal'.
