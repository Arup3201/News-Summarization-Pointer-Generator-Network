Last weekend against Arsenal had appeared to represent a significant step forward but instead of hammering their foot down on the accelerator, Liverpool threatened to stall once again at Turf Moor.

For so long here, it seemed that this would be another desperate day for Brendan Rodgers, another afternoon where his long-term credentials at the club would be questioned. Failure to win on Friday would have meant just four victories in 16 games in all competitions.

Not since 1992 - the first season of the Premier League era - had Liverpool been as low as 10th on Christmas Day. For the first hour of this game, things looked destined to take yet another turn for the worse.

Sterling scored the winner for Liverpool at Turf Moor on Boxing Day soon after the hour mark 

Burnley swarmed all over their illustrious visitors, invigorated by the adrenalin shots pumped from the terraces. This felt like an old-fashioned Boxing Day fixture, with Turf Moor packed to the rafters with families, from grandparents to toddlers, filling out all sides of this charismatic old stadium.

In that first-half, a Burnley goal appeared inevitable, the home side every bit as enterprising and vibrant as their visitors were anaemic and listless.

Liverpool looked ripe for a giant-killing. The problem for Brendan Rodgers these days is that his side's issues are not contained to one area. Instead, the malaise spreads throughout the team, from back to front and the current 3-5-2 formation with Kolo Toure in defence, Jordan Henderson at wing back and Raheem Sterling as the lone striker feels rather akin to putting a flimsy plaster on an open wound.

Once again at Turf Moor, Liverpool had no focal point in the final third. Raheem Sterling scuttled around, dribbled with purpose and finished with composure to decide the game but the feeling remains that his considerable qualities are wasted in this position.

It only serves to underline Liverpool's impotency in front of goal. They had just five shots in this game. Before this match, Liverpool's seven forward players - Sterling, Coutinho, Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge, Lazar Markovic and Fabio Borini - had played 4,435 minutes in the Premier League this season. Taken together, they had scored just seven goals - averaging a goal every 663 minutes - or every 7 or so games.

It is a quite stunning statistic and a damning indictment of the transfer committee reportedly responsible for Liverpool's summer transfer strategy. Rodgers will hope that a solution can be uncovered in the January sales or that Sturridge recovers sooner rather than later.

Perhaps even more urgent is the need to recruit a goalkeeper of elite standing. Brad Jones pulled up in this game after 16 minutes and the most anxious of performances from Simon Mignolet suggests that his spell out of the team team has done little to improve his state of mind.

He looked horribly short of confidence, skewing long-kicks out of play, flapping at crosses and causing all sorts of panic for those in front of him. 

Clearly, Mignolet is a more talented goalkeeper than the recent months suggest and there must be some sympathy for him. It is difficult to imagine what it must be like when the quicksands of self-doubt takes hold, when the opposition supporters goad you with chants of 'You're **** and you know you are', as an unforgiving Burnley home crowd did here. 

Even more presing is keeper Simon Mignolet's lack of form and now an injury to Brad Jones

As it transpired, Mignolet survived here and who knows, the clean sheet may restore some confidence to the stricken Belgian. He was bullied and harried but he survived. Maybe, just maybe, it could be a turning point for both Mignolet and Liverpool.

That, however, must be countered against a growing number inside Anfield that perceive that this struggle extends beyond a crisis of confidence and that Mignolet instead simply lacks the requisite qualities to be a first-choice goalkeeper at a club of Liverpool's aspirations.

Rodgers will certainly hope for the former and he will also view this result as fundamental in the club's attempts to hunt down the seven point gap that separates his side from Southampton as they look to secure Champions League football for next season.

If that is to be achieved, Liverpool must make a major step up from this performance.
