Being expelled from school is not usually a cause for celebration.

But when these two public school runaways were told their places at £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College were ‘untenable’ they gave each other a high-five.

Edward Bunyan, 16, and Indira Gainiyeva, 17, attracted headlines worldwide after fleeing their Jesuit Catholic school in cold and wet Lancashire to the sunny Dominican Republic.

Both sets of parents are allowing the pair to stay together, after saying the teenagers are 'madly in love'

Another
 private school has been lined up for both the teenagers as their  
families believe it would be too disruptive to separate them – though it
 is thought they will have to sign a ‘good behaviour contract’.

The
 replacement, Mount St Mary’s College in Sheffield, is expected to give 
them a rigorous interview in which they must show they have mended their
 ways.

A source said: 
‘They will face an exacting interview and the school will want to know 
they are serious and  committed about their education at Mount St 
Mary’s.

‘They could be
 asked to sign a “good behaviour contract” which would mean the school 
could expel them if they infringed the school rules in any way.’

Laurence
 McKell, head teacher at the £25,000-a-year college, said: ‘They will 
both go through the usual application procedure, an interview, and 
we’ll  have to look at their school record  and academic grades before 
accepting an application.’

The headmaster of Stonyhurst says he will allow the couple 'one last chance' at education and has arranged interviews for them both at Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield

Edward then rides away on the back of the bike. The pictures were taken on the same day girlfriend Indira Gainiyeva, 17, and he were told they would not be able to go back to their school

He said he could not comment on whether there would be any ‘specific conditions’ for the two pupils.

The young couple fled their 400-year-old boarding school in Clitheroe 
on January 13, telling friends they wanted to escape the rain.

They were found in the Dominican Republic a week later, sharing an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana.

Edward’s
 mother, Susannah Bunyan, 56, from Canada, and Indira’s father,  Ravil 
Gainiyev from Kazakhstan, flew out to be with them.

Last night, they were all said to be  flying out of the country.

Andrew
 Johnson, head of Stonyhurst, is understood to have asked the parents to
 remove their children from the school with immediate effect. He said 
the Mount St Mary’s interviews were the teenagers’ ‘last chance to make a
 success of their sixth-form education’.

Mr Gainiyev, 50, said: ‘I don’t think  we can part them now. If they are together it will be a good motive for them to study.’

The decision came as Indira’s mother Firuza, 44, blamed Britain – as well as young love – for her daughter’s disappearance.

Speaking from the family mansion in Kyzylorda, Kazakhstan, she said: ‘There are many shades in this story. For example, how did she manage to leave the country? How did Britain let them go at their age? Why did this other country let them in?

‘I think it was both love and a strict school,’ she added. ‘They ran away, then they got scared, they  are children. Thank God, they can go back to studying. They will get on with their education.

‘I only thank God she is alive and healthy. And I thank God she will be back at school.’

The young couple fled from the 400-year-old Roman Catholic boarding school in Clitheroe in the early hours of January 13, after telling friends they wanted to escape from the rain.

They took a taxi to Manchester airport and boarded a plane to the Dominican Republic, where they were found, a week later, staying in an apartment in the resort of Punta Cana.

Indira’s father Ravil and Edward’s mother Susannah flew out to be with them and they are all now staying in a five-star all-inclusive resort. The families are expected to fly back within the next few days.

In Punta Cana yesterday, Mrs Bunyan declined to comment but Mr Gainiyev was pictured trying to reason with his daughter, who was clearly upset.

A relative of Indira said that the girl feared having to return to conservative Kazakhstan after an internet backlash in her home country.

The relative said: ‘She told her father, “How can I go back to school, and how can I live anywhere now? I face shame and disgrace. I cannot live calmly in Kazakhstan, everyone will point a finger at me”.’

An official statement released yesterday by Stonyhurst said that Edward and Indira’s parents withdrew their children from the school after long-distance phone discussions with the head about the repercussions of their children’s behaviour.

But The Mail on Sunday understands that decision was made after Mr Johnson made it clear to all parties that the pupils’ continued position at Stonyhurst was untenable.

A school insider said: ‘Although they have not been formally expelled, the effect is exactly the same – they won’t be returning  to Stonyhurst. Both pupils have been withdrawn at the headmaster’s request.’

The Mail on Sunday understands that Edward and Indira have been offered interviews at £25,000-a-year boarding school Mount St Mary’s College near Sheffield.

Past pupils include Victorian  poet Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Lofting, who wrote the Doctor Dolittle books.

Mr Johnson said he helped to arrange the interviews after both pupils had given an account of  their behaviour to their parents,  and apologised.

‘I have spoken to the head there and as a result have secured interviews for both Edward and Indira  at the school. It is now up to them to take it forward,’ he said.

‘They have both said sorry for what they have done and for the distress they have caused and we wouldn’t want to leave them high and dry, no matter what they have done. They have been given a  last chance.’

Mr Johnson added: ‘In a way, what has happened has been a lesson to others who might be contemplating the same thing.

‘Pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure, but they soon saw all the trouble that Edward and Indira’s actions have caused.

‘They also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions, which have led to Edward and Indira being unable  to return to school.

‘All of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea. That in itself is a very powerful deterrent.’

A member of the Gainiyev family said yesterday that Indira’s wealthy father accepted that his daughter wanted to continue to study with Edward.

The relative said: ‘He now wants  to see her at this new school with Eddy, and that both of them can do as well as possible so they can go  on to good universities.’
