It was the reality TV show we loved to hate. 

Starring the likes of Calum Best, Paul Danan, Rebecca Loos, Bianca Gascoigne and Sophie Anderton, twelve single celebrities spent five weeks on an island in Fiji and the British public watched on tenterhooks to see if romance would blossom. 

And now, ITV2 is allegedly planning to relaunch the show, albeit with a slightly new format and new name: The Resort.

According to reports, this time around, the series will see celebrities mingling with members of the public, as they holiday together in a luxury seaside resort. 

The saucy remit is the same: producers are hoping that contestants will find love, and viewers will be able to vote who stays and who goes.

An anonymous ITV insider told the Daily Star: 'The programme is just in its development stage at the moment, but it is hoped filming will begin somewhere hot in Europe early this summer.

'The idea is for single celebs to try to find romance with ordinary members of the public.'

'Instead of them being on an island, they're going to be sent away to a posh resort instead'. 

Love Island began in 2005 and was presented by Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, who was later replaced by Fearne Cotton.

Viewers could vote for which two of the 13 celebrities would enter the 'love shack' together to get to know each other better.

TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, 44, and Fran Cosgrave, 38, won the first series, while Bianca Gascoigne and Calum Best won the second series.

But the show made the most waves when a tropical storm hitting the island, resulting in the residents of the island being stranded and the live eviction being cancelled.

Love Island was axed after just two  series when it received poor viewer ratings.
