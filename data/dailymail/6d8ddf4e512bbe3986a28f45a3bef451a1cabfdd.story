Yingying Dou reportedly runs an essay writing company

Academics have criticised universities for accepting international students with low-level English proficiency purely for financial gain.

They say it is inevitable the international students - some described as 'functionally illiterate' - try to cheat the system, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Such concerns were reportedly raised by academics who say they were ignored for fear of revenue loss by the university.

This comes after it was revealed that Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, had reportedly been running a website called MyMaster which  helps students cheat. 

Head of the Australian National University's South Asian Program, Dr McComas Taylor, told the Sydney Morning Herald that 'universities have become addicted to revenue streams from international students'.

Dr Taylor said there are international students who are being accepted into universities but are 'functionally illiterate'.

'If you let in a student who can't read, write or speak English at a sufficiently high level, it's a very natural consequence that they're going to end up cheating like this,' he said.

Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down

The vice-chancellor of a university that was targeted by MyMaster - a company that offers to write students' essays for them - said she was 'not surprised' about the latest cheating revelations.

UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander spoke out after a woman was accused of running a business that writes university essays to help Chinese international students in Australia pass their degrees.

A Sydney Morning Herald investigation by Amy McNeilage and Lisa Visentin claims after they discovered more than 900 ghostwritten essays. 

Yingying Dou, 30, allegedly charges up to $1000 for essays written by her  100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney.

It’s claimed that MyMaster has an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves.

Professor Alexander told the ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.’

She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming.

‘We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,’ she said.

‘When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,’ she explained.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: ‘Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!’

Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website, which has now been taken down. The company’s Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it.

She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account.

‘We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,’ a description on the page reads.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dou for comment but she has not responded. 

Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism.

The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise ‘many people do, for a variety of reasons’.

‘Some students plagiarise because they don’t fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,’ a warning on their website reads. 

Ms Dou also reportedly runs Yingcredible Tutoring, which is another service for students

When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is ‘all your own work’. 

Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of ‘dishonest plagiarism’, which is when they ‘knowingly presenting another person’s work as one’s own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source’.

And ‘engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration’. 

A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.'

'Failure to adhere to the University’s high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University’s Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion.

'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.
