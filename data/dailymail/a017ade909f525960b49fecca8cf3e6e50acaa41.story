A pair of legendary Hollywood stuntmen famed for death-defying vehicular stunts in films such as 'Speed' and the TV series 'Dukes of Hazzard' have died in a car crash.

Bob Orrison, 86, and his best friend and fellow stunt veteran, Gary McLarty, 76, died in the crash in Rancho Cordova, California. 

Their Chevrolet truck was being driven by Orrison when it was hit by a white Jeep, with McLarty in the passenger seat.

McLarty's wife Hillorie had dropped her husband off at his best friend's home an hour before the crash.

She said: 'These are people who spent their adult life doing dangerous things in a calculated way. It defies my imagination.' 

Police said the Jeep was travelling at 55 mph at the moment of impact and the two occupants of that vehicle were hospitalised.

The retired Hollywood stuntmen had decades of movie credits on their resumes. 

Orrison, a Korean War vet, once doubled for big screen cowboy Audie Murphy, before moving to vehicle stunts on films like 'Days of Thunder', 'The Wild Bunch' and 'Rambo III'.

He was the driver in the movie scene from 'Speed' when a bus drove off an elevated freeway, and was among stuntmen who raced the car known as the General Lee in 'The Dukes of Hazzard' television series.

His sister, Mary Hunt, said: 'He was tough, that's for sure.'

His wife Tatiana added: 'He was very young. He didn't feel he was old.'

McLarty appeared in more than 150 movies, including  'The Blues Brothers,' 'Beverly Hills Cop,' 'Jurassic Park,' 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Lethal Weapon 2.'

He drove the motorcycle up the frat house stairs in the movie 'Animal House,' and doubled as 'The Fonz' for motorcycle scenes on the 'Happy Days' television series. 

More recently, he was a stunt driver on Tom Cruise film 'Collateral.'

In 2005, he also testified at the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, saying that Blake offered him $10,000 to murder Blake's wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley, but he refused. 

Bakley was fatally shot in Blake's car outside a restaurant in May 2001.
