Tom Daley marked his return to his hometown of Plymouth in the best possible way by taking gold on the last day of the British Gas Diving Championships.

There was a tremendous buzz at the Plymouth Life Centre on Sunday.

Daley, the Olympic 10-metre platform bronze medallist, unveiled his new twister dive - a forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike - that no one had performed before.

The 20-year-old, whose highest scoring dive was the front four-and-a-half somersaults tucked with a mark of 96.20, finished with 493.70 points to secure his second national title.

He beat 14-year-old Matt Dixon while City of Leeds' Matty Lee got the bronze.

'I dived pretty well considering it was the first competition I have done in about five months,' said Daley.

'Everything was steady, nothing was amazing but nothing was bad but I'm looking forward to building on that in the competitions to come.

'My dive, the new twister, went pretty well actually. It was all there.

'I could have done a little better on some of the elements, like getting my entry better, but that all comes with a new dive. The more I do it, the better it will get.'

Daley, who moved to London to train a year ago, is looking forward to competing at the World Championships this summer in Kazan, Russia.

'It's the first opportunity to qualify for the Olympic Games so I need to make sure I'm in the best shape,' he added.

'But we've got the World Series before that, so there are lots of chances to practice my new dive and make sure that I am in the best competition shape.' 

The London 2012 Bronze medallist used his new twister dive for the first time during the final in Plymouth 

In the other event on the final day, five-time British champion Rebecca Gallantree captured gold in the three-metre springboard.

Gallantree missed her second dive in the final but hit back in the third round with her front three-and-a-half somersaults piked.

She finished with a score of 304.20, while club team-mate Katherine Torrance got silver and Plymouth's Rhea Gayle settled for bronze.

'My reaction is a little bit mixed,' Gallantree said. 'I did two really good dives which I am really happy with but then the other three weren't so good. The younger divers are coming through really quick.

'I mean Katherine is looking great who was in second place and Rhea pulled out a really great performance. The depth in women's springboard is amazing.

'Four or five years ago there were a couple of divers at the top and then there was just no one behind but now we've got so many girls pushing those big scores and it's fantastic.'
