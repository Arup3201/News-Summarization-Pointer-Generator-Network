Police in Halifax, Canada, announced Wednesday that they have found the body of a pregnant college student who went missing nearly two weeks ago.

Loretta Saunders, 26, was discovered dead on a median off Route 2 of the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick - more than 450 miles from her hometown of Halifax.

Saunders, a criminology major in Saint Mary's University who had written a thesis about missing and murdered aboriginal women, was last seen February 13 on her way to collect rent from her tenants.

Tragic end: Pregnant college student 
Loretta Saunders, 26 (pictured), was found dead off a road in New Brunswick nearly two weeks after she was seen leaving an apartment 
building in Halifax, Nova Scotia

Resting place: Saunders' remains were discovered near the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick

Law enforcement officials said they have ruled Miss Saunders’ death a homicide and have identified the suspects in her slaying, National Post reported.

The victim’s two tenants have been previously arrested in Ontario, some 2,000 miles from Halifax, for allegedly stealing Saunders' car.

On a mission: Saunders was last seen going to pick up rent from sketchy tenants Victoria Henneberry, 28 (left), and Blake Leggette, 25 (right). When she turned up at the apartment, the couple was not there and they didn't leave a check, so she called to tell them they needed to move out

According
 to a statement released by police, Saunders’ remains were found at 
around 4.30pm Wednesday off a road west of Salisbury.

Police
 are not saying if Blake Leggette and Victoria Hennenberry, who have 
been renting Saunders' apartment, will face charges in her murder, but 
officials said they are not looking for any other suspects.

Both Leggette, 25, and Henneberry, 28, have been extradited from Ontario back to Halifax to face charges of theft of vehicle.

Miss
 Saunders was last seen alive on surveillance footage leaving the 
Halifax apartment she started renting to Henneberry and Leggette last 
month.

Just six days 
after her February 13 disappearance, the couple were busted over 2,000 
miles away at a friend's house in Harrow, Ontario with Saunders' car and
 debit card.

Yalcin Surkultay, Saunders' 
boyfriend of two years, was the last to see the three-months pregnant 
woman, who just recently finished her undergraduate thesis on Aboriginal
 women who had gone missing or were murdered in Canada.

The two were living together after she started renting her own apartment in a high-rise building to help cover school expenses.

Victim: Police have classified Saunders' death as a homicide and said they have identified the suspects and are not looking for additional ones

Facing justice: Both  Leggette (left) and Henneberry (right) have been sent back to Halifax to face car theft charges

But Saunders had been having a hard time collecting $700 in rent from the tenants she met on classifieds site Kijiji, so she was going to get the funds in person.

'She went to get her rent Thursday and said if they didn't have it she'll tell them they have to leave.' her brother Edmund Saunders told the National Post. 'When she got there they weren't home. She phoned them, apparently, and told them they had to leave.'

That was the last time she was seen 
in person. CCTV footage caught her leaving the building, and it doesn't 
seem like she was followed.

On camera: Security camera footage shows Saunders leaving the apartment building she started renting to Henneberry and Leggette in January, and it doesn't seem like she was followed

Taken: Six days after Saunders went missing, her tenants were found more than 2,000 miles away with her stolen car

Long way from home: Saunders went missing form Halifax, her car was found 2,000 miles away in Harrow, and her body was discovered in New Brunswick

Hideout: The couple were found and arrested at a friend's house in Harrow, Ontario

At one point, her boyfriend received a
 bizarre text message saying she had locked herself out of her online 
banking account and couldn't remember her mother's maiden name to unlock
 it.

Saunders also had a 'suspiciously short' text message conversation with her sister on Friday, and then ceased all contact.

Saunders was officially reported missing February 17 when she went a long time without contacting her father.

The

 following evening, authorities tracked down Henneberry and Leggette 
more than 2,000 miles away, staying at a friends house in Harrow, 
Ontario.

They had driven there in Saunders' blue 2000 Toyota Celica and had been using her debit card since the day she went missing.

Full of life: Sanders lived with her boyfriend of three years, Yalcin Surkultay (right), and was said to be excited about becoming a mother

Student: Saunders had been studying sociology 
and criminology at Saint Mary's University for the past three years and 
wrote her undergraduate thesis on Aboriginal women who had been murdered
 or gone missing

Will she ever be seen again? Saunders family is organizing search efforts in Halifax, but her brother admitted that they fear the worst

The couple were arrested on charges of possessing a stolen vehicle, but they were also discovered to be fugitives in other provinces on unrelated charges.

Leggette had an outstanding warrant for not appearing in Calgary court while his girlfriend Henneberry was wanted for threatening someone in Halifax in 2011. 

Originally from Hopedale, 
Newfoundland, Saunders was an aspiring lawyer who spent the last three 
years studying  sociology and criminology as an undergraduate at Saint 
Mary's University. Her brother said she was excited to become a mom for 
the first time.

But her past also seems to be marked with hardship. She was a recovering drug addict and was on a Methadone treatment program.
