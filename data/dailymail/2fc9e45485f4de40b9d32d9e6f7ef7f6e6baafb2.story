An international footballer has been expelled from the London Olympics after directing an allegedly racist insult at South Koreans on Twitter.

The Swiss Olympic delegation have sent defender Michel Morganella, 23, home from the Games after he posted the message in the wake of the team's 2-1 defeat to South Korea on Sunday.

The star posted the message shortly after the game, saying that 
South Koreans 'can go burn' and referred to them as a 'bunch of 
mongoloids.'

Gian Gilli, chef de mission for the 
Swiss Olympic delegation at the Games, said: 'Michel Morganella gravely 
insulted and discriminated against the South Korean people and their 
football team with his highly offensive comments on Twitter.

'We condemn his comments, which are in fundamental violation of the IOC's Olympic charter and Swiss Olympic's own ethics charter.

'This is why, in consultation with the Swiss Football Association, we have withdrawn Morganella's accreditation.'

Morganella is the second athlete kicked 
off a London Olympics team for offensive Twitter comments, following 
Greek triple jumper Voula Papachristou.

The Swiss player accepted the decision and went on to apologise for his behaviour.

Disgusted: Switzerland's Olympic team chief Gian Gilli said the player's comments were 'highly offensive'

He said: 'I am sincerely sorry for the people of 
South Korea, for the players, but equally for the Swiss delegation and 
Swiss football in general. It's clear that I'm accepting the 
consequences.'

'After the disappointing result and the reaction from Korea that followed, I made a huge error,' Morganella added.

Mr Gilli said the player had been 'provoked' by comments sent to his Twitter account after the match.

Still, the Swiss team leader 
acknowledged that Morganella had to be sent home under the terms of the 
International Olympic Committee's code of conduct, which requires 
athletes to show mutual respect.

'In this case, we felt we have no alternative,' Mr Gilli said.

Swiss media published images of a tweet from Morganella's account. The account has since been deleted. The tweet was 
written in a garbled form of French, appearing to combine a kind of 
French slang called verlan and text-messaging style.

Swiss officials with the team in Cardiff, Wales, said players were told Morganella was already on his way home.

Mr Gilli said he had tried to contact the head of the South Korean team in London to offer a personal explanation.

'We would like to apologise, especially to the South Korea National 
Olympic Committee and the South Korea Football Association for the 
behavior of the player,' he said.

The IOC has encouraged the 10,800 athletes at the London Games to 
communicate with fans through social media, but it issued guidelines on 
the standards of behavior it expected.

Morganella played the entire game in both of Switzerland's matches. He 
received a yellow card against South Korea in Coventry. The Swiss drew 
1-1 with Gabon in Newcastle on Thursday. Switzerland plays its final 
group match against Mexico on Wednesday.

Morganella debuted with the senior national team in May and currently plays for the Italian club Palermo.

'We hope that he will draw the necessary lessons for his still young football career,' Mr Gilli said.

Last week, Greece Olympic officials tossed Papachristou off the team 
after she posted a comment mocking African immigrants and supporting a 
far-right political party.

There was further controversy on the social networking site this evening when diving star Tom Daley reacted angrily after he was targeted by a troll.

The abusive Twitter user told the teenager he had let his late father down by missing out on a medal this afternoon, prompting a host of complaints from Daley's fans.
