Google has said plans to block pornography from search engines would still fail to protect British children.

Sarah Hunter, the company's head of UK public policy, believes the Government's plan for a bar on adult content would give parents a false sense of security and would be a 'mistake'.  

Instead she says adults should always supervise younger children while they surf the internet and chat openly with them about sex as they grow up.

Protecting our youngsters: David Cameron has promised tougher restrictions on explicit music videos, violent computer games and internet porn but Google say it would be a mistake

'Legislation would be a mistake,' she said at the Google conference in Watford yesterday, adding a filter would only 'overblock or underblock' and 'deskill' parents.

'The best thing we can do is make sure parents sit with their children on the internet when they're very young and have conversations with older children about sex in general.

'We at Google also believe that children shouldn't be seeing pornography online.

'What we disagree with is the mechanisms by which we protect our children. It's not that easy and the solutions that are being discussed are not perfect.'

The Google executive also claimed yesterday to have ‘no idea’ how much money the search giant makes from advertising alongside online pornography which can be viewed by children.

Ms Hunter pleaded ignorance during a debate hosted by Google on whether to block porn on the internet to protect youngsters.

A spokesman for the firm later said: ‘We do not break out our revenues  for any area.’

But it is clear that Google makes thousands of pounds per day from paid-for advertising alongside search results after a user keys in a word such as ‘porn’ on the British site.

Google’s own AdWords programme, designed to help advertisers work out how much it will cost to buy the top advert next to a key word such as porn, indicates it will cost as much as £8,000 a day.

Power: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches

Adverts further down the list cost less, but Google’s British profits would clearly run to thousands from ads placed next to every word associated with pornography. Worldwide profits would be far more.

Mrs Hunter told the Google Big Tent media event yesterday in Hertfordshire that the responsibility for protecting children from pornography on the internet lies solely with parents.

Her comments fly in the face of a Daily Mail campaign to protect children by blocking internet porn from computers unless an adult user specifically opts in and elects to see the content.

Google has nearly total domination of the search engine market and is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches, but it refuses to do so as it insists it is a parental responsibility.

Campaigners suggested one reason for Google’s insistence that children’s internet use is the responsibility of their parents is the amount of money the search giant makes from porn advertising.

Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell argued that the internet was ‘full of the most debasing sado-masochistic pornography that no child should ever see’ and said an opt-in policy was the best option.

But Mrs Hunter, a former adviser to Tony Blair on media issues, warned that legislation to filter pornography on the internet was a ‘mistake, absolutely’.

CONCERNS over Google’s creeping intrusion into private life were heightened yesterday when its executive chairman said it would like to know even more about its customers.Eric Schmidt told the Big Tent event that knowing who users’ friends were and what they cared about would improve its services.‘Don’t you think that Google search –  with your permission, I need to say very precisely – will do a better job if we have more information that singles you out – who you are, what you care about – in terms of search results?’ he asked.His words will strike a sinister note for civil liberties campaigners who already believe that Google harvests too much information about its users. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Sadly it is impossible for the average person to figure out what data Google is collecting and how it is being used, a problem exacerbated by the company’s pursuit of combining data from across its services. ‘As far as companies like Google are concerned, you and I are not their customers, we are their product.’

Asked about the amount of money pornography brings in for Google, which makes almost all of its profits through advertising, Mrs Hunter said: ‘I have no idea. We don’t go out of our way to make money from pornography.

‘Like all search engines, we do allow advertisers to place adverts alongside searches that show adult content.

‘But it’s legal. Let’s just be clear. I don’t see the problem with that as long as we put in place sufficient safeguards, as much as we can, for children.’

The event, at the five-star Grove Hotel, was hosted by Channel 4 figures and free copies of the Guardian were handed out.

The Google spokesman added: ‘Like other search engines, our policies allow ads to appear next to search results that contain links to legal pornography.

'We also place ads on other people’s web pages but not on pornographic sites.

‘We understand that some people don’t want to see this material, or have their kids stumble upon it.

‘Google’s Safe Search screens for adult websites and advertising and removes them from search results.’
