A lottery winner who separated from his wife after scooping a £148million jackpot is in a new relationship with a stable girl 16 years younger than himself, it has been reported.

Adrian Bayford is seeing 27 year old horse groomer Samantha Burbidge, who worked at a stable in Thurlow close to Haverhill in Suffolk, where the 43-year-old lives.

She is believed to have now quit her job and moved into his five bedroom home after a whirlwind three week relationship.

Separated: Mr Bayford and his wife Gillian separated and he moved out of their £6million Cambridgeshire estate. He is now reported to be seeing a 27-year-old

Their nine-year marriage 'broke down irretrievably' 15 months after the second biggest UK lottery win ever

It was also reported that the pair are currently enjoying a holiday at a £500-a-night resort in the Maldives.

Miss Burbidge posted a picture on Facebook of her standing on a sun-drenched beach.

A friend of the couple told The Sun on Sunday: 'They are like love-struck teenagers. They can barely take their hands off each other.'

Mr Bayford split from his wife Gillian, 41, in November and the couple announced that their marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after scooping Britain’s second biggest lottery prize.

Mr Bayford – who actually bought the winning EuroMillions ticket – blamed the stresses that their massive jackpot brought for the collapse of their nine-year marriage.

Last month it was reported that Mr Bayford, 43, has developed a ‘friendly relationship’ with Polish-born Marta Jarosz, 30. Miss Jarosz, who lives in a terraced home close to Mr Bayford’s new £500,000 property in Haverhill, Suffolk, works as a nightclub bouncer and is thought to have met him while he was on a night out.

Mr Bayford told the Mail at the time of the split from his wife: ‘Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful. Things happen. Sometimes in life you have to move on. We’re all happy now and life goes on.’

They strenuously denied that anyone else was involved and Mrs Bayford brushed off rumours that she had become close to their bodybuilding groundsman Chris Tovey, 40.

He worked for the couple until he claimed he was hit by a golf buggy driven by Mr Bayford on their 200-acre estate and is now thought to be taking legal action against them.

In December, it was reported that Mrs Bayford was in a relationship with car dealer Alan Warnock, who sold her some of her fleet of cars.

They met in October last year, when the Bayfords visited Gillian’s parents in Scotland – and were sold five luxury vehicles at an Audi dealership by Mr Warnock.

Mrs Bayford, a former hospital healthcare worker in Cambridge, is now thought to have set up home with the sales manager in an exclusive estate in her home town of Dundee.
