Adam Gemili truly announced himself on the global stage on Monday night as the 20-year-old won a Commonwealth silver medal in the men's 100 metres.

Gemili finished second in 10.10secs behind 22-year-old Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole, whose long, loping strides allowed him to reel in the Englishman after his explosive start to win in 10secs flat. Nickel Ashmeade, the Jamaican champion, was third in 10.12secs.

Gemili's time may not have been as quick as the 10.07secs he clocked in the semi-final and he has still to break that magical 10-second barrier but, quite frankly, who cares. That will come.

Disbelief: Gemili can't hide his delight as he looks at a big screen at Hampden Park to confirm his silver medal

Shocked: Gemili covers his face after realising that he's pipped Nickel Ashmeade to second place

More pertinent was the fact this prodigiously talented, yet still raw, sprinter soaked up the warmth of the Hampden Park crowd, smiled broadly when he was introduced and then managed to split two world-class Jamaican sprinters to earn his place on the podium and his first senior medal.

Bailey-Cole, after all, is part of Usain Bolt's training group working under coach Glen Mills in Kingston and, at 6ft 4in tall, bears more than a passing resemblance to the world's fastest man.

Yet Gemili's was also an exceptional performance of confidence and class, delivered when it really mattered. It was also an emphatic response to Michael Johnson's criticism of Gemili's refreshingly enthusiastic and endearing approach to his craft.

Gemili said: 'I'm buzzing. I can't believe it. This is great for me. I was always pushing for the gold, but that's my first senior medal and what better place to do it than on home soil.

'Hopefully I can keep progressing and to use this as a stepping stone to be more established in the senior ranks.

'I just love running at major championships. The main thing is that the crowd give me energy that I need.

'Michael Johnson is such a well-established man, but that is how I run. I can focus.

'I train with a smile on my face. I enjoy what I do. When I am in the blocks, I am focused.'
