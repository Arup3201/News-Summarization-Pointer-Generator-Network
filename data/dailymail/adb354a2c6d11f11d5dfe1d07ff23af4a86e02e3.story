Rangers boss Ally McCoist has told Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson to stop ‘moaning’ as the row over the Charlie Telfer transfer fee rumbles on.

An SPFL tribunal this week ordered the Tannadice club to fork out £204,000 in compensation to the Ibrox club after signing the youngster in the summer.

Rarely used by McCoist, Scotland Under-19 midfielder Telfer turned down a new contract after 10 years at Rangers to team up with Jackie McNamara’s side on a Bosman and was named SPFL Young Player of the Month for November.

After Tuesday’s verdict, United chief Thompson, who had initially offered £100,000 for the 19-year-old, described the figure as ‘ridiculously prohibitive’ and warned it could have a serious impact on young Scottish players’ ability to move clubs under freedom of contract.

But McCoist hit back by claiming Thompson has no reason to complain because he knew the regulations before making his move to land the talented teenager.

‘Stephen knew the rules before he went and got Charlie,’ said McCoist.

‘I don’t think you can complain about the rules after you make your own decision. You have to abide by them.

‘Of course I can understand Dundee United’s disappointment and frustration. But they knew the rules before [they signed Telfer] and now they are having a moan about the rules. I’m not so sure I can understand people complaining about the rules after when they know the rules.

‘We got our just rewards for the education we gave Charlie over the last 10 years.’

The Rangers boss will be without star man Lewis Macleod tonight for the Championship clash against Queen of the South but revealed the hamstring injury sustained in the horror Petrofac Training Cup semi-final defeat at Alloa won’t lead to a lengthy spell on the sidelines for the recent Scotland call-up.

Yet, while McCoist says there is nothing to report on interest in the creative midfielder, he doesn’t expect his injury to render his star player invisible to other clubs.

‘I don’t expect interest probably because I’m not wanting any interest,’ he said. ‘But I’m not daft enough to think that good players don’t attract interest and Lewis is obviously a very, very good player We will just have to react to whatever happens.

‘But it goes without saying that I understand the economics of the whole situation and I wouldn’t be too keen on losing one of our better younger players.’

Meanwhile, Ibrox midfielder Nicky Law has admitted he felt like hiding away after that Indodrill Stadium debacle against Alloa last midweek. But he vowed that effort is not a problem at Ibrox.

‘There’s nobody in our dressing room pointing fingers and accusing others of not trying,’ he said. ‘It’s nothing to do with a lack of effort. We’ve just been switching off at the wrong times. But we are proud professionals and the desire to win this league is huge.

‘But I feel for the fans because they are disappointed. I saw some of them were suggesting we should have gone over to them after losing matches (at Alloa and Hearts), like the Dortmund players did when they lost (at Arsenal in the Champions League). But that’s probably the last thing we should have done.

‘After losing, the last thing our fans would want to shake is our hands.

‘But I feel for the manager too. He’s taking the stick and he’s hurting. But we are the players who are making mistakes and not doing our jobs and we owe it to him to start winning.

‘But we are still in three great competitions we are confident we can still have a good season.’
