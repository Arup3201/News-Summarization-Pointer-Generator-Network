A New Jersey woman has been reunited with her Yorkshire Terrier and flat-screen TV that were snatched during her first date with a man she met online.

The victim, who hasn't been named, called police early Saturday to say that her dog, Violet, had been tied by its leash to the TV, and both were left in the front yard of her Dover home, the Daily Record of Parsippany reported.

Violet appeared to be in good health.

Authorities say the pair met on a dating site and went out for the first time Thursday night.

After returning home, the woman said she became occupied in another room, leaving the man alone.Â 

When she returned, he was gone - and so were her dog, valued at $4,000, and her TV, worth about $3,000, the The Record reported.

The woman said she knew the man only as 'Joel' and believed he lived in Elizabeth.

Sgt. Richard Gonzalez spent Friday following up leads on the alleged dog-napping.

Police said the man used the woman's cellphone, so they dusted it for fingerprints.

They also checked other locations that the short-lived couple visited on their date.

Asking for the public's assistance in finding the terrier and 'Joel,' police released a description and his photograph from the dating website.

He was described as Hispanic and about 5 feet 9 inches tall. He wore a black hooded jacket, blue jeans and black boots on the date. He was driving a gold-colored Mercedes, possibly from 2004 or 2005, with black and beige leather interior and tinted windows.

But by Saturday police said that they knew the man's identity and that charges could be filed, though the investigation is ongoing.
