Apple has admitted some of the iPhones they sold over two years ago are experiencing shorter battery life than is expected

Frustrated iPhone 5 users are being offered free handset replacements by Apple after a batch of the popular models were discovered to have faulty batteries.

Apple has admitted some of the iPhones they sold over two years ago are experiencing shorter battery life than should be expected.

An update posted on Apple's website on Friday said: 'Apple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently.'

However, the new handsets are only being offered to people who bought iPhone 5 models between September 2012 and January 2013.

The phones must also fall within a limited serial number range.

Customers can find out if their phone is eligible for a replacement by entering their handset's serial number on the website.

'If your iPhone 5 is experiencing these symptoms and meets the eligibility requirements noted below, Apple will replace your iPhone 5 battery, free of charge,' Apple said.

The replacement programme is available as of August 22, 2014 in the U.S. and China. In other countries, it will be available as of August 29, 2014.

Apple are offering some iPhone 5 owners a free replacement for their faulty batteries

For people who are still experiencing short battery life but are not eligible for a replacement, there are tips that are recommended by tech experts to extend your talk time.

These include enabling 'flight mode' when you aren't using your phone for calls and texts and disabling push notifications for apps and emails.

You can also visit an Apple retail store for an 'Extended Battery Life Test'. This allows iOS technicians to see a detailed report of battery usage on your device. If your battery is defective, the technicians can replace it for free if your iOS device is under warranty.
