Cirrus des Aigles was denied a fourth win in the Group Two Prix Dollar on Saturday after being disqualified for causing interference.

But the eight-year-old gelding did more than enough to show he was back to form after being injured when winning the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June.,

He will now try to win the Group One Champion Stakes at Ascot which he landed in 2011.

Longchamp stewards demoted Cirrus Des Aigles, who passed the post first, to fifth after deeming he had interfered with Planetaire in his prolonged duel with second past the post and promoted winner Fractional.

Barande-Barbe said: 'He has still 'won' the race, and he was off for a long time, so I'm still very happy.'

Fractional is trained by Andre Fabre and owned by the French branch of Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin organisation.

Their spokeswoman Lisa-Jane Graffard said: 'It's quite an emotional feeling, tempered because you don't want to win a race in the stewards' room and I'm sorry for all the fans of Cirrus Des Aigles. There are no plans for him at the moment.'
