Nearly two thirds of children living in California are physically unfit, according to worrying new test results.

Just 31 per cent of more than a million school pupils assessed by the state's education department were ranked in the 'healthy zone.'

The shocking figures present California with a 'tremendous health challenge' the department's head, Tom Torlakson has warned.

Unfit: Less than a third of children in California have been rated as 'physically fit' in tests conducted by the state's education department (file picture)

The tests involved 1.3 million fifth, seventh and ninth-grade students from across the state.

This is the second year in a row that youngsters in California have received poor fitness results in the tests. Fitness levels in the state had previously been found to be improving.

'When
we can call fewer than one out of three of our kids physically fit, we 
know we have a tremendous public health challenge on our hands,' Mr 
Torlakson, told the Los Angeles Times.

Concern: This is the second year running that Californian youngsters have scored poorly for fitness. This follows years of steady improvement (file picture)

Mr Torlakson warned that their is a 'very clear link between physical fitness and academic achievement.'

He
said Californiaâ€™s children should be given 'more opportunities for 
exercise, along with better access to healthy foods and clean, fresh 
water,' according to the Times.

The state's education department is trying to promote healthy options for youngster's in Californian in schools.
