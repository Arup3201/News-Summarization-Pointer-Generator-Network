For most people, all they require from their toilet is that it flushes without blocking itself.

But now a new high-tech loo has been launched which includes a heated seat, a massage function, and two 'sanitising nozzles' which it claims eliminates the need for toilet paper.

It even includes a lid which automatically opens and closes for you. However, $10,000 (£6,000) for most people it will remain little more than a pipe-dream.

The Neorest 750H will lift its own lid, has a massager built into the seat, uses sanitising spray nozzles so there is no need for toilet paper and will even flush itself when you're done

The designers of the TOTO Neorest 750H claim it is inspired by modern architechture, with the seat placed exactly 17in off the floor to make it as comfortable as possible.

The seat itself includes two stainless-steel spray nozzles which provide 'the ultimate in personal cleansing', with a built-in dryer for your delicate areas.

There is a deodoriser to get rid of any unpleasant smells, and the seat will even remember your daily routines and use that information to mist the bowl before and after use, 'preventing waste’s adherence'.

Special chemicals used in the bowl mean it has a 'pearlescent' appearance. The chemicals also react with a UV light in the lid meaning it cleans itself while closed without the need for water

Using a high-tech flushing system means that even those living in penthouse suites with low water pressure can get a good rinse

The sanitising nozzels will also clean themselves and, using a remote control, people can even adjust the water pressure and temperature for maximum comfort.

The seat also has temperature control which can be adjusted from 88-99F and includes a massage function.

As if all that wasn't enough to tempt you, the lid has a built-in UV light which reacts with a coating on the toilet to clean it while it is not being used.

An extravagant flushing system means even those living in penthouse suites with low water pressure get a thorough flush using less water than a conventional loo.

For those working on a tighter budget, there is always the Swash 1000 seat, which comes with a lot of the same features, clips on to any toilet, and costs $400

When you are finished washing, drying and massaging yourself, the toilet flushes automatically and closes the lid behind you.

If all that isn't enough to tempt you into spending $10,000, there is the Brondell Swash 1000 Bidet, essentially a toilet lid which includes the nozzles, deodoriser and heating functions that is available for only $400 (£240).

The seat comes with clips meaning it can be placed on top of any lavatory, turning your bog-standard bog into something a little more hi-tech.
