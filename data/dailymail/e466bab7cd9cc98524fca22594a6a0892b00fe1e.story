A former model who won £32million in her divorce from her first husband has had her second husband jailed in a row over their £40million fortune.

Fashionista Alisa Thiry secured the eight-figure settlement when she split from French Connection boss Stephen Marks, father of her three children, in 2004.

The wealthy divorcee then married Belgian businessman and property magnate Didier Thiry, 52, who was already worth £8million when their relationship began, a court was told.

Jailed: Didier Thiry, 52 has been sent to prison for 'flagrant' contempt of court during his multi-million pound divorce battle with his wife Alisa

Didier Thiry's four-month sentence is the result of a row between the pair about a £13.8million loan

The couple live on the exclusive Kensington Park Gardens in London and their shared assets include a luxury beach house on the Caribbean island of St Barts, where they met.

But Mrs Thiry, 49, is now in the throes of her second multi-million pound divorce battle – and yesterday Mr Justice Newton ordered that her husband be sent to prison for ‘flagrant’ contempt of court.

His four-month sentence is the result of a row between the pair about a £13.8million loan.

The High Court heard that Mrs Thiry, who has worked as creative director at French Connection and fashion editor of Elle, was already wealthy when she met her second husband – not least as a result of her first divorce.

And after they had married, as ‘part of very complex financial arrangements between husband and wife’, a company owned by Mrs Thiry made a loan of some £13.8million to one of Mr Thiry’s companies.

Mrs Thiry claims this has never  been paid off – and judge Sir Peter Singer made an order requiring  Mr Thiry, who runs a boutique hotel  in Belgium, to disclose information relating to the loan to Mrs Thiry on March 12 this year.

But Harry Oliver, representing Mrs Thiry, told the court that Mr Thiry had failed to comply with that order.

The barrister said Mrs Thiry wanted ‘vital information regarding a bond issued over companies relevant to [the divorce] proceedings, and how a loan owed to the wife, that is the central object of proceedings, worth [£13.8million] plus, will be met.’

Mr Oliver said Mr Thiry’s failure  to 
comply with the order showed  disregard for both his wife and the  
British court system, adding: ‘The breach is a breach of … explicit  
court orders to provide relevant and necessary information.

‘It is of course a breach of the  fundamental duty of full and  frank disclosure.

Battle: She then married Belgian businessman and property magnate, Didier Thiry, 52, but now the couple, whose assets include a luxury beach house on the Caribbean island of St Barthelemy (pictured), are divorcing

‘Such a duty is the bedrock  upon which the efficacy of the  court process in financial remedy  proceedings is based.’

Urging
 the judge to jail Mr Thiry, he went on: ‘The husband is hampering not 
just the wife but this court’s proper exercise of its function. It is 
submitted that a fine … will neither be sufficient punishment nor secure
 future compliance.’

Jailing
 Mr Thiry for four months, Mr Justice Newton said his contempt in 
failing to disclose the information had been ‘flagrant’ and he had 
‘simply failed to comply with the order’. He added: ‘I take the view 
that this type of behaviour cannot be tolerated.

Mrs Thiry worked as creative director at French Connection and fashion editor of Elle. Right, her first husband, Mr Marks, whom she split from in 2004

‘It
 must be understood by this  husband, and by all husbands, that when 
considerable time, money  and effort have been expended, it is simply 
unacceptable for the court to be treated in this way.

‘I find the contempt proved … and  in the circumstances I propose to  pass an immediate sentence of four months imprisonment.’

The judge also ordered the husband to pay £10,000 in legal costs.

Mr Justice Newton added that Mr Thiry is currently in Belgium but he will be arrested the next time he sets foot on UK soil.

However,
 he gave him an opportunity to apply for a hearing to ‘purge his  
contempt’ by handing over the information ordered by the court and 
offering an apology.

Mrs Thiry declined to comment  outside court after the hearing.  Her husband did not attend and was not represented.
