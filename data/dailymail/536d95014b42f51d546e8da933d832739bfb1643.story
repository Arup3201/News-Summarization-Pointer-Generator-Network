A family has witnessed the death of a two-year-old boy, who was struck down and killed out the front of his Arizona home by a recycling truck.

Officials say the toddler was bent over trying to get something out of his foot, believed to be a cactus spin, when the accident happened about 4.10pm Wednesday near Lone Mountain Road, Cave Creek, in the north valley of Phoenix.

The child was playing at the time with his five siblings and mother, who yelled at the driver of the Waste Management truck to stop, but it was too late.

They stood 'horrified' as the truck backed over him.

The boy was pronounced dead at the scene.

A Waste Management recycling truck has backed over a two-year-old boy, who was playing out the front of his house in Cave Creek, in the north valley of Phoenix

Scene: This is street where the accident happened. The house is at the end of the road. Because of its narrowness, trucks back down because they cant turnaround

Neighbors in the remote area told azfamily.com that because there is no turnaround the trucks back down the narrow, dirt street, which leads onto desert.

Devastated: Parents Sara and David Tarnanen are mourning the loss of their son, who has five siblings

Deputies investigating the devastating accident say they have been surprised by the way in which Waste Management have handled themselves.

The driver, 41-year-old Bernardo Hernandez, has exercised his right not to submit to a field test, including sobriety test, or submit a statement.

While authorities have no reason to believe the driver was impaired or speeding, and are likely to close the case as an accident, they have not been able to ask him whether he saw the boy in the rear-view camera.

It means the accident will never be fully explained.

Investigators said the recycling truck’s safety equipment was functioning properly, including beeping as it backed up.

The company issued a release on Thursday that expressed condolences but also said, 'we are cooperating fully with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and other local authorities on the investigation'.

However Maricopa County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Brandon Jones said that is only partly true.

'Waste Management has assisted and cooperated as far as equipment inspection and such, but has not allowed our detectives to ask any questions and would not submit to a field test,' Jones said.

The boy has not been identified, however police have said his parents are Sara and David Tarnanen.

As you can see, the Cave Creek street is extremely narrow, with trucks having to back down in order to get back out

The remote community has been rocked by the tragedy, according to neighbors

'The mother was out there with five siblings,'Lt. Jones told 3TV.

'To watch this happen has to be just horrifying to all of them.'

One neighbor said she was devastated by the accident.

'There are no words,' Sandra Murphy said. 

'They have a lot of kids who are always playing outside. 

'This is just horrible.'
