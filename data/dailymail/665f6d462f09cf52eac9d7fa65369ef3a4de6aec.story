‘I’ve heard it said I must be gutted to have been brought up in a place like Peckham. Rubbish.’

Rio Ferdinand – ‘Rio: My Story’, 2006.

Next to Leyton Square on Peckham Park Road in Southwark, south-east London, there is a blue circular plaque, discreetly placed on the side of a building.

'Rio Ferdinand,' it says in white letters. 'Peckham’s football legend, who lived on the Friary Estate.'

The plaque overlooks a patch of grass and a fenced concrete playground with buildings covered in brightly coloured murals. Ferdinand used to call it ‘The Adventure’.

‘That adventure playground was the hub of the estate,’ recalled Damien Mills, who was in the same school year as Ferdinand at Camelot Primary School on nearby Bird-in-Bush Road.

‘Everybody left their kids there, but we were all safe because they always knew where we were.

‘There were lots of single parents and it was a good place for us to go after school before everyone got called in for dinner.

'You could always hear Rio’s mum calling: "Ree-oh!” Everybody knew her voice.'

Ferdinand was born on November 7 1978 in King’s College Hospital, Camberwell, and lived with his mother Janice and younger brother Anton in a two-bed flat in Gisburn House until he was 14. The Ferdinands' father, Julian, a tailor, moved to the nearby to the Yellow Brick Estate when Rio was nine and Anton was two. His parents never married.

The Ferdinands’ council flat overlooked a patch of grass Rio used to call ‘Wembley’. The fading blooms of red roses mark it now, along with a sign saying ‘No Ball Games’. Not that this would have stopped Rio and Anton.

Andy Morgan lived two doors along on the second floor of Gisburn House. He remembered the boys as ‘very civil and well-mannered’ - even when they were racing other kids from the estate across the car park.

Mr Morgan told Sportsmail in 2010: 'We always thought Anton might be the better player, because he would always win their races. He just looked so natural.’

The young Rio was afraid of dogs, but Mr Morgan let him play with his mongrel, Ranger. He too recalls Rio’s mother calling her son's name as darkness fell, the signal that another day’s play was to end.

‘She was very strict,’ said Mr Morgan. ‘They were never in a lot of bother.’

Ferdinand has said he ‘learned all about life’ during those early days on the Friary Estate. He had to, after all.

‘You became street-wise but you got a sense of real values as well,’ he said in his 2006 autobiography.

Mr Mills agrees. ‘I think, in a way, it helped Rio,' he told Sportsmail in 2010. 'There used to be a real community spirit. The older kids played football with the younger ones, and we aspired to be like them.’

Yet Ferdinand's upbringing was quite different from the lifestyle he and wife Rebecca have been able to give their children Lorenz, eight, Tate, five and Tia, three.

The Friary estate would be scarred by the death of Damilola Taylor in a stairwell on Blakes Road, less than a mile from where the Ferdinands grew up, in 2000.

Ferdinand also knew and was at school with Stephen Lawrence, the 18-year-old who was stabbed to death waiting for a bus in Eltham, six miles south of Peckham, in April 1993. The North Peckham estate received a £290million investment in 2007 and the high-rise blocks are gone, but this is not the Peckham of Del Boy and Rodney.

Mr Morgan, who has lived in Gisburn House for more than 40 years, described stepping over piles of rubbish to get out of the door. There are plenty of public sports facilities – basketball courts, concrete five-a-side pitches and climbing frames - but few kids playing on them these days.

‘The estate’s not the same now though, the warmth has gone,’ said Ferdinand in his autobiography.

‘Everyone keeps to themselves and it’s lost its heart. There’s hardly any kids playing outside there any more. It’s weird, almost eerie.’

Mr Mills added: ‘There were a lot of opportunities for Rio to go down the wrong path. We all know guys who didn’t make it; who just had too many other distractions.

‘For people outside the area, you think of Del Boy and Rodney, but I think a lot of the problems are the same as in any area of poverty.

‘It was too easy to get side-tracked and there were people who were as good as Rio, or better, who didn’t make it because they didn’t have that focus.’

Ferdinand certainly had focus, but he cannot have had much spare time, either. He represented Southwark in gymnastics at the London Games and attended the Central School of Ballet in Farringdon four times a week for four years, doing jazz dance, contemporary and modern ballet. He was also in a drama club at Peckham Settlement, a local resource centre.

Aged 10 he represented Bloomfield Athletic and then spent a year at QPR before playing in midfield a little closer to home at Eltham Town.

By the time he was 14 – and a pupil at Bluecoat School in Blackheath where he would achieve GCSEs in English, maths, drama, PE and science – the Ferdinands had moved to a three-bed flat in Latona Road, the other side of ‘The Adventure’. Janice married Peter St Fort in 1993 and when Rio’s half-sister, Sian, was born, the family needed a bigger home.

The Latona Road flat was, however, nothing compared to the four-bed £300,000 detached house in Mottingham near Bromley that Ferdinand was able to buy the woman he called ‘Super Mum’ when he was 19. ‘All our possessions fitted into the front room,’ he said.

By then, Ferdinand had left Peckham behind and was making waves as a classy central defender for West Ham United. His move to Leeds United in November 2000, when he became the world’s most expensive defender, was only three years away.

But although Ferdinand moved away from the Friary Estate he had called home throughout his childhood, ‘Peckham’s football legend’ has never forgotten his roots. They, too, have never forgotten him.

The shop where Rio used to buy sweets after school and the butchers where his mother would buy meat are still there. People talk about Ferdinand fondly, and with considerable pride. There is a folder in Peckham’s prize-winning library chronicling the newspaper articles that chart Ferdinand’s progress.

There have, of course, been considerable peaks and troughs during Ferdinand's career as a professional footballer but, for many, he remains the boy who raced home from school and dreamed of emulating Diego Maradona.

‘We’re really proud of what he’s done and always hoped he would make it,’ said Mr Mills. ‘Nobody in Peckham really realised you could be a pro footballer.'

And it all started on an adventure playground in Peckham.
