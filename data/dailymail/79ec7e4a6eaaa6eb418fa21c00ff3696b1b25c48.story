From a mythical 40's spacecraft, to a cigarette packet sketch, then to the drawing board, and finally to reality in someone's front garden in Towcester, Northants. 

This is the story of the UK's only Roswell caravan.

Daniel Gregory's persistence, skill and enthusiasm has produced the only Roswell caravan in the country. And as far as anyone knows the only other one ever made is in the United States, but that one is used as a utility trailer with a welding machine in the back. 

Daniel Gregory is believed to have the only 'Roswell Caravan' in the UK, and maybe one of two in the world

The vehicle that 43-year-old Mr Gregory built serves the original purpose it was designed for - as a small family caravan with a double bed in it.

For more than 70 years this unique style of caravan existed only as a rough sketch based on a mythical space craft in the States when space exploration was in its infancy, and Dan Dare was the hero of the day.

Then a few years ago Andrew Gibbons a CAD (Computer aided design) engineer from Newcastle decided to put pencil to paper or in this case 'mouse to computer,' and proceeded to draw a fully dimensional layout of the Roswell from the 70-year-old sketch of what people thought a spacecraft would look like back then. 

Not only does Mr Gregory's design look like something from a space mission, but it is useful as a place for the family to stay on trips

Daniel Gregory used designs by an engineer from Newcastle to design the UK's only Roswell Caravan

Mr Gibbons's aim was to see if anyone might take up the challenge and actually make one.

A few year ago Gregory found out about the existence of the fully finished plans of this as yet, none existent caravan and decided to produce the first one. So he asked Gibbons if he could use his drawings, and produce one for himself and his family, to which the latter was only too pleased. 

Taking around 250 hours of bending shaping and welding, from within his friend's barn, came the birth of the first glistening Roswell caravan. It is made out of sheet aluminium instead of plywood, which was originally planned and 30mmx50mm tubular steel under frame. 

Gregory had put his skills to good use. He left school in 1986 to train and work as a 'Stick welder' in an engineering company that produced components for North Sea gas rigs, but after two year doing that he decided that he wanted to join the RA, spending four years working on transportation. 

The caravan certainly stands out in Mr Gregory's hometown of Towcester in Northamptonshire, with people eager to catch a glimpse

This could be an alien head in the bubble, or maybe just a button on the special caravan

Then a change came along again and he went back to engineering. This time he learnt the skill of 'Tig' welding and he became a fully trained Fabbie, hence his knowledge of welding aluminium and bending sheet metal stood him in good stead for this project. 

In 2000 he went to work with Virgin trains but for the past nine years he drives trains from Banbury for Chiltern railways.

Gregory just loves having things to do, so when this project came up he put his heart and soul into it. Nearing the completion date he had in mind, he put even more time in to finishing the caravan, working on if for five days in a row putting in 15 hours days.

Before Gregory made the full-scale van, 11 feet long by five feet wide and 4.7 feet high, he made one out of cardboard at 12th scale to see if there was going to be any potential problems

Interestingly the indicator lights on top of the wheel arches are from a 1950's jet that he bought of Ebay.

Mr Greogry worked on the project for five days in a row putting in 15 hours days as he neared completion of his masterpiece

The Roswell Caravan is towed around the country by Mr Gregory who takes it to various rallys

His four-year-old daughter Victoria loves the caravan her dad made and helps him clean it.

Last summer her nursery school was doing a week's project on 'Space' and Dad was asked if he would bring the Roswell down to the school.

'It was great,' said Daniel. They (the children) were all over it and inside and out. They were so excited, as to them, I suppose it looks quite large and they would never have seen anything like it before.'

Asked how much interest the space caravan garners, he added: 'I don't even have to take it out of the front garden, as I, or my wife have people knocking on the front door asking if it's for sale or where can they get hold of one.

'I have even been asked by someone in America if I would go over there and make one, but I'm not into that I've got too much going on here. Also if I'm taking it to a rally I see people taking photos from their car windows as they over-take me. 

Mr Gregory took advantage of a rare day of January sun to polish up his special mobile home

'It tows like a dream you wouldn't know you have anything on the back. I suppose it's so aerodynamic that adds to its stability'.

So far it's only Daniel that has been away in the caravan but he is now starting to get it ready to take wife Jo and his daughter with him down to Weymouth in a few months time. 

So out came the metal polish and his electric polisher/buffer on one of the first sunny days this year, and with a lot of elbow grease and a little help from his daughter, he took over six hours to bring back that mirror finish that gets dull and oxidised when it stands out in the garden over the winter months. 

'It doesn't take long to get dull again, added Gregory. 'It's a bit like painting the Forth Bridge, it's an ongoing process.'

Also he needs to revamp the inside, as he is happy to crash out on a bit of sponge and a sleeping bag when he's on his own in it, but he wants to make the inside as impressive as the outside for his wife and daughter when they all go away in it.

Space is limited and it can only take a double bed, a few under bed lockers and bringing the 1940s style up to date, he also wants to install a flat screen TV as well. 

'Jo and Victoria will sleep in the caravan and I'll sleep in the awning when we go away he says, so there's no problem there.'

As well as looking like a space shuttle, inside it has a double bed and is used for trips away
