'Healthy': Presenter Donna Air, believed to be a UK size 4, says her body is natural and she eats healthily

She is the first to admit ‘I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life’.

But Donna Air has now expressed her horror at discovering that images of her are being used on pro-anorexia websites to encourage girls with eating disorders to lose more weight.

Miss Air, 34, is being used as ‘thinspiration’ for sufferers who are starving themselves and are desperate to lose more weight.

Celebrities including supermodel Kate Moss, and presenter Fearne Cotton have all featured on the sites, on which anorexics offer tips and motivation to their followers.

But those used as pin-ups are largely unaware that their pictures are being used.

And today Miss Air, who is currently dating James Middleton, brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, said she was ‘alarmed’ to hear she has become ‘thinspiration’ material.

She said: ‘I didn’t realise I was on any sites and I certainly can’t take responsibility for something as huge as that,’ she said when alerted to the sites.

'I hope these girls get the help they need.’

Miss Air is believed to be a UK size 4 and appears to have recently lost weight. But she insisted she has a ‘healthy’ body image and is a positive role model to her daughter Freya, 10.

She said: ‘I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life. I just don’t sit down – I’m always on the go.

'It must be down to the genes. We have a healthy body image in my house and great appetites.

'It’d be hard for you to find a food I don’t love.’

Miss Air, who rose to fame on the children’s television drama Biker Grove, is known to take Bikram yoga classes to stay in shape.

The intense classes, which last 90 minutes long, take place in around 40 degree heat and are a favourite among celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow.

Today a leading education commentator said she feared ‘stick-thin’ celebrities could have a negative effect on young girls.

Helen Wright, who has been a headmistress at some of the UK’s leading schools, said: ‘No-one is a good role model for anorexics wishing to get thinner; anorexia is a complex psychological illness, but it is exacerbated by the contributing factors of ‘celebrities’ seeking to be stick-thin.

'We need better for our daughters.

‘Parents should be very worried about pro-anorexia websites.

'They promote incredibly unhealthy behaviours around food and lead to potentially fatal consequences.

'There is nothing good about these sites,
and anyone in the public eye who finds themselves associated with them 
should be prepared to denounce them in the strongest terms.’

It comes after experts warned young girls were being driven to eating disorders by super skinny models like Cara Delevingne.

Miss Delevingne, who is the face of some of the world’s biggest fashion brands, and her ‘thigh-gap’ became an object of fascination for teenagers.

They shared tips on how to get legs that,
like Miss Delevingne’s don’t meet above the knee. And they pledge to 
starve themselves to reach their goals. 

However experts said a ‘thigh-gap’ was neither natural nor healthy.

And today a spokesperson from an eating disorders charity warned that images of celebrities are often airbrushed leading to unrealistic perceptions of beauty.

Leanne Thorndyke, from b-eat, said: ‘Pro-anorexia sites are dangerous in that they frequently encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are.

‘Pro-ana sites can encourage people to avoid treatment, and that can be life threatening. Eating disorders have the highest death rate of any mental illness.

‘One typical feature of a pro-ana site is the so called ‘thinspiration’ pictures of famous people looking very thin. These pictures are frequently digitally altered to make them appear even more slender than in real life.'
