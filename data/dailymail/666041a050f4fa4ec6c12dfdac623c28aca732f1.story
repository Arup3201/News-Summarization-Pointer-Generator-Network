The FA of Wales will quote a catalogue of mitigating circumstances after being charged by UEFA over a pitch invasion following Gareth Bale’s winning goal against Andorra.

They will point to the frustrations of the Euro 2016 qualifying match being staged on a substandard artificial 3G pitch, described by Bale as the ‘worst I have ever played on’.

There had been no warm-up events at Andorra’s new Estadio Nacional, the pitch only passed a late inspection and very inexperienced stewards — many in flip-flops and shorts — had not been properly briefed about crowd control.

Real Madrid asked Gareth bale not to play the full match against Andorra due to the poor quality pitch

Wales will also complain the pitch was only watered at half-time in the half Andorra were attacking, with the hosts claiming the irrigation system hadn’t worked on the remainder of the playing surface.

Meanwhile, Wales couldn’t adhere to a gentlemen’s agreement with Real Madrid to ensure Bale did not played the whole game. The Spaniards were understandably concerned about the world’s most expensive player turning out on such a poor pitch.

Wales insiders claim the understanding with Madrid was that Bale would be taken off once victory was assured. But they needed him for 90 minutes after Andorra took the lead with their first competitive goal in four years and Bale’s winner didn’t come until the 81st minute.

Darren Eales, Tottenham’s executive director, is to become president of MLS newcomers Atlanta. Eales follows his Spurs predecessor Paul Barber, who left to run Vancouver Whitecaps before returning as CEO at Brighton. 

Eales is on the FA’s pointless International Committee, which never meets, and won’t be able to do ambassador duties from the USA.

Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers' hotel is causing controversy already

The 133-room Hotel Football next to Old Trafford, in which Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil and Gary Neville are investors, has upset fans even before it opens in December. 

They are moaning that the hotel, which is already fully booked for all home games this season, has a minimum two-night stay policy when there is high demand. 

But the ‘Class of 92’ say the hotel is adopting the same business practice as their Manchester competitors and the biggest challenge will be attracting customers when United aren’t playing.

Arsenal’s Theo Walcott, bidding for a set of sports paintings at a Willow Foundation charity auction, promised to donate £26,000 for nothing, provided his bid rival paid £25,000 for the paintings — which he did.

England outcast Kevin Pietersen will not just be limiting himself to hitting back at his many detractors in his autobiography, to be published on October 9.

KP is also going on a book publicity tour that starts at The Monastery in Manchester on October 7 and includes literary festivals in Cheltenham, Bath and Guildford plus a date at the Institute of Education in London, giving him plenty of opportunities to launch into Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Andy Flower and Matt Prior to name but four.

The hand-picked hosts of the ‘Evenings with Kevin Pietersen’ are sure to be sympathetic to the author, as in Cheltenham where the questions will be asked by top sports journalist David Walsh, who was KP’s ghostwriter. Surrey have not selected KP for their last two Championship games and will need to be convinced he still has an appetite for cricket before offering him another contract.

Kevin Pietersen will go on a tour to talk about his autobiography which will be published next month 

Saturday morning football is the latest battleground in the Sky v BT war.

Soccer AM is seen as a target which BT’s Fletch and Sav programme can outperform.

BT claim they had done so after the first Saturday, adding that Sky overlord Barney Francis went into his Isleworth HQ to monitor the ailing Soccer AM output. 

Sky counter that Francis always views the first Premier League weekend from his office and that BT massaged their figures, which have more than halved since, by taking their peak when viewers were just switching on to watch Manchester United.
