A home video from 1988 has revealed that a couple had actually crossed paths 16 years before they were set up on a blind date.

Jourdan Barovick was 10 when she was being filmed by her parents coming down a waterslide in Langhorne, Pennsylvania.

A boy in glasses aged 13 walks across the video- it is her future husband, Ryan Spencer, reports NJ.com.

In a strange coincidence Ryan and Jourdan were introduced by 16 years later on a blind date and are now married with three children.

The couple, who grew up 45 minutes away from each other, only realized when they were watching old family videos a few years ago. 

'We did a complete double-take,' Jourdan Spencer said. 'We paused, we rewound, we paused, we rewound, over and over again.

'We told everyone we knew — and then the tape went missing. We had no proof this whole time.'

The video sees the pair at Sesame Place amusement park - Jourdan's mother is standing with her younger siblings, when Ryan strolls past, directly in front of the camera.

The pair re-found the video at Christmas last year when it was transferred on to DVD and showed their family who compared the boy in the video to photos of younger Ryan.  

'I got a chill at first,' Ryan Spencer said. 

'I couldn't believe it was me, and then it became kind of a romantic thing.' 

After being set up on a blind date they married in 2007 - they have three children - Sophie, six; Max, three and Mabel, five months.

They took their children back to the summer spot where they first met - and plan to give them the video as a keepsake when they are older.
