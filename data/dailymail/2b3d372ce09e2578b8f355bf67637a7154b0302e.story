If the idea of getting on a flight already fills you with dread, the latest breakthrough in aviation technology could turn fears into full-blown phobias.

Researchers have successfully shown how a pilot can take off, fly, twist and turn, and land a drone using just his thoughts. 

The flight involved an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap and specially-designed software - and it could one day lead to passenger planes being controlled using only brainwaves.

Researchers have successfully shown how brainwaves can be used to control and land a drone (right) in Portugal. During a public presentation in Lisbon, the team used a high-performance electroencephalogram (EEG) cap (left) to measure the brain waves of a ‘pilot’. An algorithm converted these  signals into commands

The brain-to-computer interface (BCI) software was developed as part of the Brainflight project.

Brainflight is the work of four firms including Tekever, Champalimaud Foundation, Eagle Science and Technische Universität München.

During a public presentation in Lisbon, Tekever and Champalimaud teams used a high-performance EEG cap to measure the brain waves of the ‘pilot’.

A bespoke software and algorithm then converted these brain signals into drone commands.

In December, a groundbreaking experiment gave a double amputee two mind controlled arms.

Les Baugh, who lost both arms in an electrical accident 40 years ago, was able to operate the system by simply thinking about moving his limbs.

After training his muscles to use the new arms, he was able to lift cups, and perform a range of motions with each arm, in a procedure experts say could change the way prosthetics are used. 

By thinking about which direction he wanted the drone to travel, the pilot was able to fly, turn and land the craft.

‘The drone operator, wearing a cap that measures brain activity, influences the drone’s path using nothing but simple thoughts,’ said Tekever.

‘Essentially, the electricity flowing through the pilot's brain acts as an input to the drone’s control system, in order to perform, on the air, a mission with objectives previously defined by the research team.'

Brainflight combines aeronautical systems engineering with neuroscience research.

The system has already been tested in a four seat, twin engine, propeller driven airplane simulator, and the next step is to use the technology in live flights.

The researchers are hoping that BCI will be adopted in the future as a method of control for aircraft - both manned and remotely piloted.

The Brainflight work builds on previous brain-computer interface technology and software developed at the University of Minnesota (pictured). Researchers released a video showing students learning to steer a flying robot around a gym, making it turn, rise, dip, and even sail through a ring

‘Through the BCI approach, we believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,' continued the firm.

‘This will mean that pilots will be able to focus on higher cognitive activities while still being able to operate such a complex system as an aircraft.’

As a result, experts said pilots will reduce their workload, and disabled people may be able to become pilots.

Beyond aviation, the project imagines the BCI technology being used in advanced prosthetics, and to control other complex systems such as cars, boats and trains.

Similar technology was also recently shown off at the University of Texas at San Antonio. These researchers claim the technology could help make soldiers more mobile and remove the need for ground stations to send instructions to vehicles flying overhead

‘The project has successfully demonstrated that the use of the brain computer interface (BMI) on a simulator for the Diamond DA42 aircraft, where one pilot controlled the simulator through the Brainflight system,’ said Tekever’s Ricardo Mendes.

‘We’ve also integrated the BMI with UAV ground systems and have successfully tested it in UAV simulators. We’re now taking it one step further, and performing live flight tests with the UAV.’

This work builds on previous brain-computer interface technology and software developed at the University of Minnesota.

Researchers, led by biomedical engineering professor Bin He, released a video showing students learning to steer a flying robot around a gym, making it turn, rise, dip, and even sail through a ring.
