Rescue crews resumed their search Monday for the body of a four-year-old boy who went missing Saturday afternoon in Florida after falling out of his grandfather's boat.

Officials said Logan Torrance Fontana disappeared while returning home from a fishing trip near Fort Pickens in Pensacola Bay.

Logan's grandfather, Steve Maye, had dusted sand off his grandson's life and handed it back to him, saying to put it on, according to Fox 10 News.

Maye then went to the front of the 19-foot fishing boat, which he was piloting, and picked up speed.

Presumed dead: Logan Fontana, 4, fell from his grandfather's boat in Pensacola Bay on Saturday afternoon. Because he has missing for over 24 hours, the search mission has changed from rescue to a recovery mission

No life jacket: Logan fell from this boat, which his grandfather was piloting. Logan's life jacket was found inside the boat

The rescue boats are equipped with side-imaging technology, which allows officials to pinpoint certain targets underwater that could be Logan. Once something is detected divers are dent down

Maye told police that, about 60 seconds later, he turned around and Logan was gone.

The life jacket was still in the boat.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have since been searching around the clock for Logan, along with other assisting agencies and some good samaritans.

'The way it works is we set up search patterns,' Lt. Berryman told Fox 10.

'We have boats that are working the perimeters, and we have boats that are working a grid type pattern going back and forth'

Berryman said crews are also searching for Logan with aircrafts.

Most of the boats used in the search are equipped with side-imaging technology, which allows officials to pinpoint certain targets underwater that could be Logan.

For every target that is picked up, a diver is sent down to check it out.

Tragic: Logan Torrance Fontana of Pensacola disappeared from his grandfatherÂ¿s boat Saturday as they were coming home from a day of fishing near Fort Pickens in Pensacola Bay. He is presumed dead

Search crews worked around the clock to try and find Logan but have not yet found him. He has been missing since Saturday afternoon

'Right now we're utilizing our side imaging sonar which is allowing us to canvas and search an area, we're looking from top to bottom in the water column, and then out anywhere from 30 to 50 feet, on each direction of the vessel,' explained Clint Retherford, a commander with Escambia Search and Rescue.

Because Logan has not been found within 24 hours of going missing, the search is now considered a recovery, not a rescue.
