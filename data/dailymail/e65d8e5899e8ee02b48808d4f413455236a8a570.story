BBC bosses have been forced to knock down a conspiracy theory circulating online that one of their Middle East correspondents was pulled from the air after a complaint by Israel.

Rumours emerged on Twitter that Jeremy Bowen had incensed the Israelis by making 'pro-Hamas' comments in a recent article.

Writing in the New Statesman last month, the veteran broadcaster said he had not seen 'any evidence' that Hamas had used Palestinian civilians as human shields.

Twitterstorm: This false statement which emerged online has fuelled a conspiracy theory that BBC reporter Jeremy Bowen was pulled from the air after a complaint from Israel that he made 'pro-Hamas' comments

A few days later, he disappeared from TV screens and has not been seen since, prompting a flurry of speculation.

Among them was a mocked-up image of Mr Bowen next to the BBC logo with a false statement giving the reasons for his apparent departure.

It read: 'BBC has removed Jeremy Bowen from Gaza, its most experienced Middle East correspondent for saying "He (sic) had not see any evidence of Hamas using civilians as human shields".

'Israel complaint (sic) to BBC and said that this was pro-Hamas and BBC immediately pulled him out of Gaza.'

On holiday: The rumours circulated despite the veteran broadcaster tweeting that he was on annual leave

The image was quickly retweeted and within the space of 12 hours his name had appeared on the social networking site more than 3,000 times, it was noted by BBC Trending.

Despite Mr Bowen tweeting an explanation on Friday that he was on holiday, the debate raged and his superiors were yesterday forced to address the rumours.

Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of newsgathering, tweeted: 'Nonsense that @BowenBBC left Gaza under Israeli pressure. After Syria, Iraq, Israel & Gaza he's on holiday.'

The BBC later released an official statement to that effect.

BBC Trending said it can 'confirm that Jeremy will indeed be back in his usual capacity very soon'.Â
