Prince Charles and David Cameron arrived in Saudi Arabia yesterday to pay their respects after the death of King Abdullah – despite mounting protests over the country’s ‘appalling’ human rights record.

There were also claims that flying the Union Jack at half-mast last week was unnecessary, because the Saudis had not lowered their own flag.

The Prince of Wales, Mr Cameron and other leaders were set to meet the new ruler King Salman in the capital, Riyadh. But the visit was dogged by claims that UK tributes – including lowering flags at Buckingham Palace and Downing Street – were inappropriate.

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston ridiculed Mr Cameron’s claim that Abdullah, ruler of a strict Islamic country, had fostered ‘understanding between faiths’. 

She said: ‘That will ring rather hollow for anyone who wanted to convert to Christianity or even carry a Bible in Saudi Arabia.’

She added: ‘Half-mast for all Saudi women subject to enforced subservience . . . half-mast for all those Saudis and migrant workers publicly beheaded, stoned, subject to judicial mutilation or flogging.’

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch claimed Mr Cameron and the Prince were ‘spitting on’ women, gay people and the freedom of expression. 

However, former Labour Middle East Minister Kim Howells said that maintaining good relations was ‘realpolitik’ because of the oil-rich state’s strategic importance.

Flag experts claimed yesterday that the Government had no need to fly the Union Jack at half-mast on Friday in tribute to Abdullah, who died aged 90 on Thursday.

Graham Bartram, of the Flag Institute, said: ‘Saudi Arabia is about the only country in the world where we could get away with not flying it at half-mast. 

'Saudi Arabia doesn’t fly its flag at half-mast. . . because it contains the Shahada, the [Muslim] statement of faith, and they believe that would be an insult to God.’
