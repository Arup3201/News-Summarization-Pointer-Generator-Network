American Apparel models have taken to Twitter to hit back against the company after an email leaked last week said they would only be hiring 'real models' and not 'Instagram hoes or THOTS' as part of an effort to rebrand the company.

THOTS is an acronym for 'that ho over there.' 

American Apparel apologized publicly for the email and posted an image of 'curvier models' to their Facebook page on Tuesday night.

'This is American Apparel, always has been and always will be. We love all of our models, all shapes and sizes. #welovediversity #weloveyouall!,' read the caption with the photograph.

Public apology: American Apparel posted this photograph of 'curvy models' on Tuesday in order to apologize for the leaked email and to prove that they hire models of all sizes along with the caption #welovediversity

Infuriated: Model Barbara who appears in the image posted by the company on Tuesday in their effort to apologize has chastised the company for using her picture 

Insulted: Barbara says she hasn't shot at the company for several months and that their using her image is a 'slap in the face' 

One of those models named Barbara who goes by the Twitter handle @boredbarbara responded to the company's decision to post an image of her on Facebook in order to promote diversity.

'Have not shot for AA in months bc the money isnt anywhere near right and now an even bigger slap in the face loo,' she tweeted on Tuesday after the company posted her photo.

She responded to the company calling their old models 'Instagram hoes,' by Tweeting, 'just bc some girls took their brand into their own hands and garnered attention for it doesn't mean they're less credible than others.'

Barbara isn't the only model hitting back at the company over their decision to veer away from their old image.

Another 'curvy' American Apparel model named Megan Fay who goes by @meganfayy on Twitter wrote a message about the importance of self-love on Tuesday.

The email: This leaked company email said the company was going through a rebranding and would be hiring only 'real models' and not 'Intsagram hoes' or THOTS'

Model of Instagram: Barbara posts photos of herself on Instagram in an attempt to take her brand into 'her own hands' and criticized the company for calling models 'Instgram hoes'

Showing support: Barbara said that models who use Instagram to promote themselves are just as credible as other models 

'My goal with modeling has always been/will be to promote positive body image & inspire people to love themselves. Nothing can change that,' Fay wrote.

'Love yourself. Love your body. You are beautiful the way you are. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not worth your time,' she also said.

American Apparel model Valerie Chris also piped up and tweeted about the company's choice of words  to describe their former models.

Speaking out: American Apparel Model Megan fay who to some is considered 'curvy' also posted on her twitter  on Tuesday to show support for models who have been employed by the company

Positive body image: Model Megan Fay posted yesterday that she hopes to inspire more women to love themselves and that nothing can change that 

Love your body:  'Love yourself. Love your body. You are beautiful the way you are. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not worth your time,' Megan Fay also tweeted on Tuesday

'Far from deserving of any of that disrespectful language used. So good luck with that rebranding if that's the attitude moving forward,' the model tweeted under her account @valeriechris_ on Tuesday.

'Cuz these girls are far above and beyond the level of calling other women hoes or degrading their work,' she added in another tweet.

The company has desperately been trying to rebrand their image after the former CEO Dov Charney was fired following the company's willful misconduct claims that he 'acted inappropriately' and 'sexually harassed employees.'

Charney was the mastermind behind the famed ads that were sometimes criticized for being too racy or 'pornographic.'

Far from deserving: Model Valerie Chris tweeted about her disgust after the leaked company email surfaced 

Good luck: Valerie Chris wished the company good luck with rebranding their image after the email calling their models 'Instagram hoes' surfaced 

Degrading: Valerie Chris called the the company email 'degrading' in the way it criticized models' work 

American Apparel would sometimes even employ porn actors as models.

This month the company began airbrushing off models' nipples on their website in an attempt to make the advertisements less sexual in nature.

Notorious model Jessie Andrews who has worked as a pornographic actor, a club DJ, and jewelry designer posed for the brand in the past and this week shared her opinion about the company's attempt to change their look.

'I'm really disappointed in the new AA CEO. Go create your own brand from scratch. Don't try to change a brand that stands for so much...' she tweeted on Tuesday under her account @jessieslife.

Porn actress: Model, porn actress, DJ, and jewelry designer Jessie Andrews has worn many hats, one of which was for American Aparel

Dissatisfied: Jessie Andrews tweeted about American Apparel's decision to airbrush nipples and the leaked email that called the girls 'Instagram hoes'

Don't change: Jessie Andrews hit back at the company for trying to rebrand the company after former CEO Dov Charney was sacked from the company last year 

Be proud: Jessie Andrews' message to American Apparel models on Tuesday was to promote positive iamges and not fall into a high fashion mold 

Rebranding: Jessie Andrews also criticized the company for blurring out nipples and public hair on their website in attempt to make their adverts less racy and 'pornographic'

Photoshop: Jessie Andrews dug on the company's rebranding and their attempt to photoshop out nipples and hire more conventional models 

'Why blur nipples & pubic hair out when you're selling see-through lingerie?! You are not selling it to 12 yr olds! This is what made AA, AA,' she wrote on Tuesday.

'AA models work so hard to promote positive body images. You were given a body. Love it. Be proud. Don't fall into a mold,' she also tweeted on Tuesday.

Casting director Phira Luon who wrote the email on March 18 that was later obtained by The New York Post issued a formal apology and said the email, 'was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy/views in anyway,’ reported News.au.com.

Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right 

'[The] company is going through a rebranding image, so we will be shooting models moving forward. Real models. Not Instagram hoes or THOTs,' read the email in its entirety.

News.au.com also reported that American Apparel’s new senior vice president of marketing, Cynthia Erland, allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were 'too short and round.'

'It’s become a running joke around the office — like, "I can’t do this, I’m too short and round,'  said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark.

'I’ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so,' that employee added. 

Erland responded to News.com.au in a statement that said, 'This is completely false. American Apparel embraces body types of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes, and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this.'

The company urged that sentiment again on Tuesday when they posted a photo of 'curvy models' to their Facebook is celebration of diversity. 

Leaked email: A leaked email written by model casting agent Phira Luon said the company would only be hiring 'real models' not 'Instagram hoes'
