Last week she released a catchy new song called Welcome to New York. 

And her enthusiasm for the Big Apple was cemented yesterday, when Taylor Swift was announced as Global Welcome Ambassador for New York City.

Appearing on Good Morning America, the 24-year-old, who was born in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Nashville, said: 'I'm so enthusiastic about this city that I feel like, when I love something, I'm very vocal about it, I'm vocal about it with my music.

'I just go around like, "Everybody! New York is amazing!" So I think they just picked up on that and gave me a title.'

As part of her role, the singer presented a series of videos for New York's official tourism agency, NYC Go, including one in which the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'.

In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.'

But it seems not everyone is quite so upbeat about her appointment. 

The singer, who recently bought a £12million apartment in the trendy Tribeca area, has lived in the city less than a year, and residents were shocked that she was selected to represent the city.

'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world.

'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 

'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City.

'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 

'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 

'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 

'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 

'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.'

Just moments after the announcement was made, the decision was attacked by New Yorkers, who felt the singer was not suitable for the role.

'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens.

He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town.

'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added. 

'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.' 

The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses.

'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers.

'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer.

But NYC Go stood by their decision, saying: 'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City.' 

'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals,' they told MailOnline Travel. 

'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.'
