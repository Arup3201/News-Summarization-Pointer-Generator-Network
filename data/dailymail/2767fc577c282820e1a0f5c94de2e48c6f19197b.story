A YouTube video which teaches viewers how to turn themselves into a Barbie doll has been revealed as the most-watched make-up tutorial on the site after racking up nearly 60 million views, according to WWD.

The video, which was created in 2009 by YouTube star Michelle Phan, offers viewers a step-by-step guide to creating the perfect plastic look and includes everything from finding the ideal eyeshadow shades - pink, blue and white - to sourcing the best accessories - anything pink, of course. 

While recreating the look on her own face, Phan throws in a series of helpful tips such as: 'Barbie's skin is flawless so start off with acne serum that reduces blemishes and large pores.'

She even offers tips on how to create Barbie's 'tiny nose', advising viewers to 'contour' their nose in order to make it appear smaller and more doll-like. 

Starting the tutorial from scratch, without a scrap of make-up on, it takes Phan less than ten minutes to complete the entire look - including the time spent putting on her bouncy blonde wig. 

The video currently has 57 million views - a total which is growing by the hour and remains un-matched by any other beauty-based tutorial on the site.

And it's not just the Barbie tutorial that has captured the attention of YouTube fans around the globe. Phan, who currently has more than seven million subscribers to her beauty channel, also boasts similarly impressive viewing figures on two of her Lady Gaga-inspired tutorials. 

'Lady Gaga Bad Romance Look' and 'Lady Gaga Poker Face Tutorial' have received 47 million and 34 million view respectively - numbers which will no doubt continue to grow as viewers search for Halloween costume inspiration. 

'If you look at her channel now, [Phan’s] taken advantage of the seasonality [of her content],' Lisa Green, head of industry, luxury and apparel at Google, told WWD.

'She has all these Halloween videos up that aren’t even new. She is resurfacing content because she knows what people are looking for.' 

Phan's strategy is clearly paying off; it was recently revealed that the YouTuber's company, created as a means of capitalizing on her internet success, has an $84 million annual sales run-rate. 

The company's 'Glam Bags' - a monthly subscription service which provides customers with a regular delivery of beauty samples at a cost of $10 per month - currently have 700,000 subscribers.

 'I showed people how they can transform their face,' Phan recently said of her success during an interview at the Code/Mobile conference. '[Lady Gaga] really helped put me on the map.'
