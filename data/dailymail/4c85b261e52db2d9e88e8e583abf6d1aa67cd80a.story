A permanent memorial is to be built in tribute to murdered soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in his home town.

Plans are being drawn up for a 'lasting tribute' to the 25-year-old who was from Middleton in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

Drummer Rigby was stabbed to death outside Woolwich barracks in south east London in May.

Rochdale Council leader Colin Lambert said: 'We are planning, along with his family, to provide a lasting tribute to Lee which is befitting to his memory and bravery.'

It is not known at this stage exactly where or what form the memorial will take, but reports suggest it may be located in a local park.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael 
Adebowale, 22, have been charged with Drummer Rigby's murder and are due to stand 
trial at the Old Bailey on November 18.

A funeral is due to take place next Friday at a parish church in Bury, Greater Manchester.

A guard of honour will keep vigil over his body the night before the private service set, the 
Ministry of Defence has confirmed.

Bury has strong links with Drummer 
Rigby's regiment, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, whose 
roots go back to the Bury-based Lancashire Fusiliers.

The funeral will be a private service, broadcast to outsiders via a PA system, said an MoD spokesman.

Drummer Rigby's family posted a moving birthday message to their 'beautiful boy' today on a Facebook page set up in his memory.

The message: 'Happy 26th birthday to our son the hero' was posted alongside a picture of a smiling Drummer Rigby.

It
 went on: 'Love and miss u so much wish u was here with us av a good 
drink at the heroes bar u will.always be in our hearts and memories

Adebolajo and Adebowale will appear at the Old Bailey for a plea and case management hearing on September 27.

Grief: Bouquets of flowers carpeted the pavement where Drummer Rigby was killed near the South East London barracks

The outpouring of grief in the 
wake of Drummer Rigby's death saw thousands of tributes left at the 
gates surrounding Woolwich Barracks.

As
 well as the soldier's own friends and family, members of the public 
young and old - includnig veterans and fellow servicemen and women - 
arrived at the scene to pay their respects with flowers and flags, poems
 and messages of support.

The
 Queen was among those to pay her respects at the barracks in the days 
after Drummer Rigby's death, with the monarch holding a private meeting 
with friends and colleagues of the murdered soldier during a visit to 
review The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.
