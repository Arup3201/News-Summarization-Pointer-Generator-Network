A driver who flipped over his car and ejected his girlfriend onto the road faces manslaughter and negligent homicide charges.

Kieran Duffy, 26, lost control of his Chevrolet pickup truck, which entered the center median on a highway outside of Fairbanks, Alaska, and began to rollover multiple times.

The car, which was heading south around 12.30am early Saturday morning, rolled over to the northbound lanes and threw Amber Rae Evans, 26, who was believed not to be wearing a seat belt.
