Former boxing World Champion Amir Khan, pictured, was arrested after allegedly attacking two teenagers in a street assault

Boxer Amir Khan has been arrested after allegedly attacking two teenagers in a street assault.

The 27-year-old former World Champion and Olympic silver medallist was arrested in the early hours of today following an incident in Russell Street, Bolton, as his alleged victims were returning from a nearby mosque.

Police said the two men were hurt but not seriously injured in the incident.

Witnesses said the alleged attack happened after Mr Khan pulled up alongside the group of men in a Mercedes C Class.

One of the alleged victims is believed to have suffered an injury to his cheek and the other to his leg.

The men were known to Mr Khan.

Witnesses claim the incident started when a member of the group was accused of giving 'cheek' to a friend of the boxer.

One man, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed: 'Amir was saying don't you know who I am, I am AK.

'We have always looked up to him as a role model with him being a Muslim and successful. It is going to cause tension in the community.

'He is a world champion, an adult, the people involved are aged 19.'

A woman, who also did not want to be named, added: 'I could hear a lot of noise and I saw Amir's car. Then I saw him get out of the car.

'Then he drove off and there was a man on the floor.'

A spokesman from Tangerine PR, which represents the former World Champion, said: 'Amir Khan was arrested on suspicion of common assault in the early hours of Friday July 4.

'Amir has since been released without charge on bail pending further enquiries. At the stage we are unable to comment further on this matter.'

Mr Khan was arrested in March, 2006, in Bradshawgate, Bolton town centre, after a pedestrian was injured in an accident involving the boxer's BMW 654 convertible.

Geoffrey Hatton had to have a metal rode inserted in his leg following the crash.

He has since died, although his death was not due to the crash.

The two alleged victims were believed to be known to Amir Khan, who is pictured left landing a punch on Carlos Molina during their WBC Silver Super Lightweight title bout in Los Angeles

Mr Khan was cleared of dangerous driving but convicted of driving without due care and attention, fined Â£1,000 and banned from the road for six months.

In October 2012, boxer was knocked to the ground and robbed outside a bar in Birmingham.

It came after masked men had threatened to attack him via a sinister YouTube message.
