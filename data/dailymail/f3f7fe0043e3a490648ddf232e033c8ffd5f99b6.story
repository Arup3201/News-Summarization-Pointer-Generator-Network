An Australian couple's idyllic beachfront wedding photos were foiled when two groomsmen had to strip down and rescue a fisherman who capsized his boat and drifted out to sea.

Jo-Anne and Aaron Easterbrook were posing for photos with their wedding party on a jetty in Palm Cove, north of Cairns, on Monday when they saw the dinghy overturn close to nearby rocks.

The two groomsmen, Dougal Grey and Clayton Deane, immediately stripped down to their underwear and swam towards the out-of-breath fisherman.

They pulled him back towards the shore with his dinghy and then dragged him the rest of the way on to dry ground where he crashed on the sand due to exhaustion.

'I think he was a bit shockedâ€¦ exhausted but grateful,' Mrs Easterbrook told the Cairns Post.

'The fisherman wasn't in the water for very long, he was still afloat and conscious.'

The groomsmen then swam back out to pull the dinghy in the rest of the way.

Pictures of the dramatic rescue were caught on camera by wedding photographers and their aerial camera drone.

The men were captured lugging the boat's outboard motor onto the beach, as well as helping to drag the weathered dinghy to shore.

Wedding party photos resumed after the rescue, albeit with two very wet groomsmen in their underwear.  

The couple, who live in the Northern Territory, met seven years ago through their love of fishing in Nhulunbuy, east of Darwin.

They leave for their honeymoon in Fiji on Wednesday night.
