The body of millionairess Carole Waugh was found yesterday stashed in the boot of a car hidden in a lock-up.

Police said a badly decomposed body found crumpled in the back of a VW Golf was that of the wealthy former oil executive who went missing from her luxury Marylebone flat more than three months ago.

A post-mortem examination found that Miss Waugh was killed by a single stab wound. Detectives are trying to trace the owner of the vehicle as it emerged that a mystery man hired the garage after spotting an advertisement on the Gumtree website in May, just days after the 50-year-old went missing.

Found: Police have discovered the body of missing millionairess Carole Waugh, 50, in London

Police erected a tent outside a garage lock-up in the neighbourhood homeowners have described as 'peaceful and quiet'

The body was believed to have been found in this blue VW Golf which was inside the lock-up garage, after police received new information

The gruesome discovery following a 
tip-off to police is a devastating blow to Miss Waugh’s family, who have
 feared the worst after detectives discovered that hundreds of thousands
 of pounds had been siphoned off from her bank accounts by a gang 
suspected of kidnapping her.

At least three women have tried to use her credit cards and a man posed as her brother to try to sell her £650,000 flat.

Police believe Miss Waugh may have led
 a secret double life as an escort when she returned to Britain after 
working in Dubai for eight years.

Yesterday detectives began a massive 
search of automatic number-plate recognition cameras to track the car’s 
movements since April.

Police are patrolling the area as they await the outcome of the postmortem which confirmed the identity of the body to be Carole Waugh

The quiet road has become the scene of a major crime investigation, as police now pursue the possibility that Ms Waugh may have been murdered

The owner of the lock-up, which is off
 a quiet residential street in New Malden, Surrey, said a man contacted 
him after seeing the advert which read: ‘A very secure lock-up garage. 
Good access and off road. Ideal for garaging car, storage, vintage car 
etc. Electricity available.’

Nick Kerven, the director of a 
Reigate-based building company, said he agreed to hire the garage for 
£135 a month.

The man provided a home address in Central London and 
arranged to pay by standing order, but he did not specify how long he 
wanted it for.

Mr Kerven said that because the garage
 was open, there had been no need to send the new tenant keys, and that 
the man said he would use his own padlock. He added: ‘I had never met 
the guy. We put out an advert on Gumtree and in May, around the time 
this lady went missing, he called me.

‘He rang me after seeing the advert 
and I rented him the garage. He paid money directly into my bank account
 but we never met face to face.

‘It’s shocking. My father built these 
garages himself and we’ve been renting them out for 50 years and we’ve 
never had anything like this before.’

Those who worked with Miss Waugh during the eight years she spent in the Libya speak of 'a complex character' who told extraordinary stories about her life in England

Police have been trying to piece 
together the life of a ‘secretive’ and private woman who was known to 
have met men through a variety of internet dating sites.

Those who worked with Miss Waugh 
during the eight years she spent in Libya as a secretary for an oil 
company described her as ‘a fantasist with a reputation for 
exaggeration’.

Despite never marrying, she wore a 
diamond engagement ring and gold wedding band and boasted that her 
wealthy Egyptian husband had died of a heart attack and left her a 
fortune.

She told other secretaries that she 
had rubbed shoulders with film stars at parties in London and she 
claimed to be a property developer.

Miss Waugh said she owned a flat 
behind Harrods and had a top-of-the-range Harley Davidson motorbike, 
despite her modest £25,000 salary.

Despite never being married, she wore a huge diamond solitaire engagement ring and gold wedding band

Police have arrested ten people during the investigation, including arresting one man on suspicion of murder

Known as a party girl, Miss Waugh 
spent her time in Libya at the Janzour Tourist Village, a hotel and 
villa complex overlooking the Mediterranean on the outskirts of Tripoli,
 with one of the sons of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif, among her neighbours. 
But little is known about her life after she moved back to London in 
2008.

Her brother Chris, a 53-year-old 
Barclays bank manager, has described her as ‘secretive’, adding: ‘I’m 
embarrassed about how little I knew.’

Her mother Margaret, 78, said after her disappearance: ‘I think the world of her, but she’s a girl you couldn’t talk to.

‘She never gave a good answer, if you know what I mean.

‘She kept everything to herself. She spoke to me two or three times a week, then all of a sudden, nothing.’

This yellow gold bracelet in the picture is identical to that worn by Carole Waugh. It was previously missing but has now been recovered

The bracelet and its golden twin have been found but a ring and a yellow golden necklace in the same series by Cartier is still missing

The alarm was raised on May 7 after Miss Waugh failed to answer calls from her family after she was last seen on April 16.

Last night detectives were quizzing a 
47-year-old man detained when he flew into Luton Airport on Tuesday 
night and later arrested on suspicion of her murder, kidnap and 
conspiracy to defraud.

Ten people – six men and four women – have been arrested in connection with Ms Waugh’s disappearance and fraud.

Scotland Yard is appealing for information about the blue Volkswagen Golf, which has the registration number W466 NHL.
