When Kayleigh Moran was handed an envelope by an elderly stranger while she was Christmas shopping she presumed it was probably a request for a charity donation. 

Following the man's directions not to open it until he was out of sight, Ms Moran waited until he disappeared among shoppers in Ashton in Greater Manchester.

But when she opened the envelope she discovered £200 inside in cash from a real-life secret Santa. 

Ms Moran, who was shopping with her 17-month-old daughter Daisy, has no idea who the man was.

Kayleigh Moran was handed an envelope containing £200 in cash and wishing her Merry Christmas by a kind stranger in his 70s as she shopped with her 17-month-old daughter Daisy in Ashton, Greater Manchester

But she said the selfless gift helped her pay for a headstone for her grandmother's grave. It will also mean she can visit her mother in North Wales for Christmas. 

'I can't believe anyone could be that nice,' she said. 

'It has been a big help to me and I just want to tell him thank you.

'I had just assumed he was collecting for charity or doing a nice thing and handing out Christmas cards - I was so shocked when I opened the envelope.

Ms Moran followed the instructions from the stranger to not open the envelope until he was out of sight

The kind stranger is thought to be in his 70s and disappeared into the crowd after leaving the envelope

'He was an elderly man, about 70. I've never met him before and I didn't see him hand anything to anyone else.

'It is such a lovely thing to do - you see people walking past homeless people and not giving as little as 50p but this man chose to give me and my family £200.' 

The man gave Ms Moran the envelope last Thursday. 

It contained a card which said 'A little something for you' and said 'Very best wishes for Xmas' inside.

Miss Moran used some of the money to buy Christmas presents for a local children's toy appeal and will spend the rest on visiting her mother during the festive period.

The envelope was pressed into Ms Moran's hand by the kind stranger as she did her shopping in Ashton

She said: 'I have never missed a Christmas with my mum and it would have been horrible but this means I can go and see her now.

'I don't think the man would want to be recognised but I wish I could tell him thank you.

'It has made me so happy - especially that I have been able to buy some ornaments for my Gran and give her a proper grave site.'
