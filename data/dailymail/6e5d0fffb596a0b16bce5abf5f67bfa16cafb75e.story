A quarter of television viewers now watch their favourite programmes using catch-up services, it has been revealed, after the recent episode of Sherlock picked up an extra 3.5 million viewers through BBC iPlayer in the days after it was first broadcast.

Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time, overtaking the 2011 Downton Abbey Christmas special, which received 3.1 million views through ITV Player.

When total viewing figures are analysed, roughly a third of those who watch a programme will now do so through an online catch-up service or or through their television's recording device.

Play it again: Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time. One theory on why 'cult' dramas perform so well on catch-up services is because fans re-watch the same episode multiple times

The New Year's Day episode of Sherlock was criticised for failing to answer questions about how the world's most famous detective faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series.

But that didn't stop it attracting over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast, raising to 13 million when catch-up services are factored in.

The popularity of catch-up services has been attributed to changing lifestyle habits, with people often choosing to use mobile phones or tablets to watch programmes on the move, rather than at home.

Now that services such as BBC's iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4's 40D are available as standard on the majority new television sets, the practice of the entire country settling down to watch a programme at the same time is increasingly unrealistic.

Top ratings: Downton Abbey's 2011 Christmas special received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. The 2012 version was almost as popular on the catch-up service, bringing in an extra 2.76 million viewers

High ratings: The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million viewers via catch-up, with a further 2.75million watching an episode from February 4 2013

Many of the programmes with high post-broadcast viewing figures are so-called 'cult' dramas, such as Doctor Who and the aforementioned Sherlock.

Although these programmes are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views, it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast, then re-watch one or more times through a catch-up service.

Contender: Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer

Speaking to the Telegraph: Charlotte 
Moore, the controller of BBC One, said: 'I'm very proud to have Sherlock
 on BBC One and see it topping the charts as the biggest consolidated 
audience ever. It demonstrates that ambition and quality matter to our 
audience.'

Of the all time top 10 most watched programmes on a catch-up service, seven are programmes that first appeared on the BBC.

Behind Sherlock and Downtown Abbey, the 2012 Call the Midlife Christmas Special is in third place attracting a total of 2.92 additional viewers and 10.1million overall.

The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million catch-up viewers, with a further 2.75million
 watching an episode from February 4 2013.

Although the 2011 episode of Downtown Abbey sits in second place, the 2012 version was almost as popular bringing in 2.76 million catch-up viewers, taking its total to 10.3 million.

A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had its viewing figures pushed up from 9.57million to 12.23 million by catchâ€“up.

Somewhat less surprising entries were Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special, which attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer - taking the total to 12.8 million, and acclaimed dram Broadchurch, which was watched an additional 2.45million times after first being shown.

Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC's director-general has previously stated that he says catch-up services as the future of television and radio.

Still attracting fans: A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had total viewing figures of 12.23 million

Speaking about his plans for the BBC late last year, he said: 'No listener or viewer should ever have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn't ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves.'

He added: 'The BBC you can have is catching up with the BBC you want; there's a fundamental shift happening.'
