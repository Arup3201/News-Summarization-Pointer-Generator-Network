It was already going to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

Now experts are predicting this week ‘Black Friday’ will hit the record books as customers flock to the internet to buy Christmas gifts.

British shoppers are expected to spend £363million online alone, an 11 per cent increase on 2012, according to the Centre for Retail Research.

Black Friday is named after the day of frenzied shopping in the US after Thanksgiving when retailers traditionally started making a profit, or went into ‘the black’.

The concept was introduced to Britain by online sites like Amazon in 2010, but gained momentum last year when Walmart-owned Asda slashed its prices on electrical goods, leading to scuffles in stores.

Some stores are now expecting the day to outstrip next week’s Cyber Monday as the biggest online shopping event of the year.

Customers in Britain will spend more than £1million every three minutes on average on Friday – which is payday for the majority of workers – according to a report by Visa Europe.

This year the supermarket has trebled the number of deals – including a £6,500 quad bike reduced to £3,5000 - and will draft in ‘thousands’ of additional staff for the day, including extra security to cope with crowds.

Ayaz Alam, senior director general merchandise, said: ‘Last year we were the first major retailer to bring Black Friday to the UK.

‘This year, we’ve stepped it up a gear again and we’ll be bringing an even bigger and better sale to the UK than ever before.’

While Amazon started its Black Friday deals yesterday and will stagger 3,000 offers throughout the week in a bid to beat its rivals, many British retailers are keeping their deals secret until the day to avoid being undercut by competitors.

High street brands including Boots, Argos, Tesco, Superdrug and Currys PC World are taking part with sales both online and in store.

John Lewis said it ‘fully expected’ to break its record online sales figure for a single day set on Black Friday last year with offers on around 100 products.

It is opening all its stores from 8am – at least an hour early – and some will close later, with its flagship Oxford Street shop open until 10pm.

Online director Mark Lewis said: ‘Now that customers are aware of the date and expecting it, we anticipate that this year’s Black Friday will be bigger still.’

Sainsbury’s will take part for the first time this year, with 485 stores offering discounts on mainly electrical items from as early as 1am in its 24-hour shops.

Director of retail and operations Roger Burnley said: ‘It’s a competitive market, so it felt right to be part of the mix this year and kick off the busiest trading time of the year with a popular sales event.’

Some shopping centres will host their own events, with Manchester’s Arndale Centre cutting prices by up to 80 per cent for the day.

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: ‘Last year we only had three or four major retailers that were pushing Black Friday but now many more have jumped on the bandwagon. 

'I think it will go terrifically and that will link into Cyber Monday when we are also expecting good sales.’
