Passengers on board a Malindo Air flight on Monday were left terrified when its oxygen masks deployed and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangkok.

The five-hour flight from New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur was aborted and the plane diverted to Thailand after the cabin began to depressurise as it flew through a storm.

Those on board said a child vomited in her oxygen mask and an elderly man fell in the toilet ‘when the plane began losing altitude’.

The plane landed safely in Bangkok after the pilot told passengers an 'emergency descent' would take place

Flight OD206 was carrying 121 passengers, including three infants, and eight crew members when ‘a slow decompression’ was detected by the pilot, a Malindo spokesman told AFP.

He said the Boeing 737-900ER’s oxygen masks deployed as a precaution and the plane landed safely in Bangkok. 

One of the passengers, Puteri Shehnaz Majid, described the situation in a post on Facebook, saying the plane was flying over the Indian Ocean when the pilot came on the loudspeaker to announce that they would be making an ‘emergency descent’.

She said the aircraft then lost altitude in turbulent skies.

According to a report by The Rakyat Post, she said: ‘The oxygen masks came down and the AC (air-conditioner) was switched off. We were breathing through the masks for a good half an hour at least and a lightning storm to go with it.

‘The plane had to divert and we had an emergency landing in Bangkok. By the time we landed everyone was drenched in sweat.

‘A child vomited in her oxygen mask. An old man fell in the toilet when the plane began losing altitude.’

Malindo Air said the plane is being inspected for a ‘technical glitch’ and passengers were placed on another aircraft to resume their journey to Malaysia.
