Diego Poyet is wasting little time getting to know his new West Ham team-mates while on tour in France as he posed for a picture with Adrian and Mauro Zarate.

The Hammers expect to formally announce the signing of Poyet on Monday after holding talks over a five-year contract.

The 19-year-old midfielder recently tweeted: 'Not ignoring everyone, crazy but exciting last few days. All will be revealed in time. Thanks for the messages #COYI'.

Predicament: Born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, Poyet could play for all three nations

Poyet came through Charlton's academy and managed to make 23 appearances for the Addicks last season.

Born: April 8, 1995 (Age 19), Zaragoza, Spain

England youth capsU16: 7U17: 6

Debut: Charlton vs Oxford, January 21, 2014

Appearances: 23

Addicks' Player of the Year: 2013-14

He won the Charlton Player of the Year award. That came, incredibly, despite the youngster only breaking into the team in January.

Charlton had been in discussions with Poyet's representatives over an extension to his deal, which expired on July 1, but he made his feelings clear by telling the club he would not report to pre-season training.

Poyet, born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, finds himself in a rare predicament.

He can play for all three, as he holds a passport for each, but has represented England at U16 and U17 levels.
