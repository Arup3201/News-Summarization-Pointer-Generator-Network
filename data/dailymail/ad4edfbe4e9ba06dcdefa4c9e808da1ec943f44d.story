A three-year-old who suffered horrific burns in a caravan blaze that killed two relatives has defied doctors and made an astonishing recovery in time for Christmas.

Emmy Taylor received 65 per cent burns to her face and body in the fire at a caravan site near Barmouth, north Wales, in June. Her grandfather, Robert Taylor, 58, and uncle, Andrew Taylor, 26, were killed in the blaze.

Emmy, from Flint, was pulled to safety by her grandmother and has spent months in a Liverpool hospital undergoing 33 operations, including multiple skin grafts.

Now, after spending her third birthday
in intensive care, Emmy has finally been allowed home in time for Christmas - 
and is planning to go to her first pantomime on New Year's Eve.

Emmy's
parents, Laura and Ian, kept a bedside vigil at Alder Hey Children’s 
Hospital while their daughter recovered from her injuries.

Mrs Taylor, 25, said: 'She's so brave - her injuries still hurt but we control it where we can with medication.'

Emmy
still has to attend  physiotherapy sessions at the hospital three times
a week and a cream and pressure garments are applied to her injuries 
daily.

'The scars will be permanent but we don’t know what they will look like until she is older,” said Mrs Taylor.

'But Emmy is still here so we don’t care about the scars.

'We were told in the beginning that we didn’t know if we would have Emmy so the scars are the least of our worries.'

Emmy, who hopes to receive a princess castle and costume for Christmas, will be back at her nursery school at Ysgol Gwynedd in Flint next term.

'She loves being with her friends - the kids are marvellous with her and do not treat her any differently,' Mrs Taylor said.

The family is also planning a trip to 
the pantomime Cinderella in Denbigh, before the wedding of Laura’s 
sister Zoe, 24, in the town on New Year’s Eve, when Emmy will be a flower
girl.

'No doubt Emmy will steal the show from Zoe,' Mrs Taylor said.

Last month, verdicts of accidental death were recorded on Emmy's grandfather and uncle.

Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones said the fire was started by a coiled-up extension lead which would have generated heat.

A smoke detector had been fitted in the caravan but did not have a battery.
