A celebrity chef told yesterday how she was attacked by a hammer-wielding gang of robbers whose crime spree brought terror to the streets of Hampstead.

Children’s food guru Annabel Karmel thought she would die after being ambushed by muggers on mopeds who grabbed the 5ft 1in blonde and held a hammer to her head as they ripped her £12,000 gold Rolex from her wrist.

The businesswoman spoke out for the first time yesterday after the robbers, who targeted celebrities and millionaire homeowners in North London’s luvvieland, were jailed for a total of 23 years.

During a three-month crime spree, Corrie Moroney, 23, Alan Fitzgerald, 20, and Ellis Parkinson, 21, preyed on well-heeled residents living within three miles of Hampstead Heath.

They snatched luxury watches, designer handbags and gold jewellery from their victims who were threatened with a hammer, knives and a Taser.

They selected targets due to their ‘outward show of wealth’. 

One of their victims was newspaper executive Stan Myerson, the joint managing director of Northern & Shell, which owns Express newspapers, who was attacked in his driveway and stripped of his watch and cash.

Alan  Fitzgerald, 20, was sent to a young offenders institution for four years

But the gang were finally caught after robbing Mrs Karmel who helped bring them to justice. 

The 51-year-old mother-of-three was mugged in broad daylight after parking on a side street in St John’s Wood where she planned to go shopping. 

She recalled: ‘I opened the boot and suddenly these guys on mopeds with helmets on were there on the pavement.

‘One held a hammer over my head and said in a really vicious way “give us your watch”.

‘I screamed, I thought they were going to hit me with the hammer.

‘It was so scary, I just knew they would use the hammer. They grabbed my arm, I couldn’t move. They cut my arm as they ripped off my watch. Then they took my shopping bag.’

The attack on June 20 last year lasted just minutes but Mrs Karmel was able to note the number plate of the moped. 

She reported the registration to police but was astonished when the Flying Squad were able to track down the offenders just 90 minutes later after following their movements using undercover officers and the police helicopter.

Detectives showed her photographs of a moped they had recovered which still had Mrs Karmel’s £150 designer Henri Bendel canvas shopping bag in it. 

The evidence proved to be crucial in convicting the gang who later pleaded guilty to 12 robberies.

Mrs Karmel told the Mail the ordeal continues to affect her: ‘It was terrifying… It has made me feel wary. Now I am more careful and worry about getting out of my car. I run into my house. I don’t wear a nice watch or fancy jewellery.’

Blackfriars Crown Court heard how most of the victims were mugged on their driveways by the thugs who shattered car windows with hammers before stripping the terrified occupants of Rolex and Cartier watches worth up to £60,000 each, rings worth thousands and designer purses.

The thieves – dressed in black, with their faces disguised by helmets, balaclavas and scarves – struck so frequently that residents in the wealthy North London district hired ex-gurkha soldiers as private security guards to patrol the roads.

The first robbery happened on March 5 last year when a pensioner was ambushed outside his Hampstead home as he got out of his Bentley. 

The 70-year-old was hit with a hammer several times by the robbers who threatened to smash his kneecaps unless he handed over his watch.

One girl of nine whose mother was mugged wrote a poem telling of her fear at the sound of motorbikes.

The gang were finally snared after a two-week surveillance operation by the Yard’s Flying Squad who studied CCTV footage and witness statements to identify the robbers.

Ringleader Moroney was sentenced to ten years in prison plus an extra year for an assault in a betting shop. Parkinson received eight years and his accomplice Fitzgerald four years.

All of the robberies took place within a three miles or the affluent north London suburb of Hampstead (file picture)
