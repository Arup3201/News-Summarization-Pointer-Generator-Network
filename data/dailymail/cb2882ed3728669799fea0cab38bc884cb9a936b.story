A group of gypsies has been driven out of a Belgian town after the mayor hired a DJ to blast rock music at them.

The Roma had amassed 30 caravans at a site in Landen, a small town with a population of less than 15,000, around 30 miles east of Brussels, with no plans to leave.

But after a DJ played Dire Straits at a volume of 95 decibels - equivalent to the sound of a pneumatic drill from 50 feet away - they caved in and agreed to go.

The gypsies had initially agreed with a landowner to park 14 caravans at the site in Flemish Brabant province until Tuesday, according to Landen mayor Gino Debroux.

But since arriving on Sunday, they had reportedly amassed a further 16 vehicles.

'Since then, they've said they won't leave and they're there with 30 caravans,' Mr Debroux told Reuters via phone earlier this week.

'This is an industrial site and is not designed for camping.'Â 

Controversial decision: Landen mayor Gino Debroux (right) said the music was 'a way of putting pressure on' the gypsies. Left, a group of Roma children started dancing to the music when it played yesterday morning

Mr Debroux said the group's refusal to leave had prompted him to hire a DJ to blast music at them from 9am yesterday.

'This
 is a way of putting pressure on them. It was very difficult to 
negotiate with the gypsy king, as he called himself,' he said. 'It's a 
non-violent method to ask them to come to an agreement.'

The
 DJ kicked off his set with Dire Straits' 'Sultans of Swing', before 
continuing to play music at 95 decibels until shortly after midday, 
according to local media.

Belgian television showed Roma children dancing to the music.

'I want to thank the mayor,' said one camp resident. 'It's very nice that he sent a DJ for us to have a party.'

However, by midday, the Roma had agreed with police that they would leave the site. They are expected to depart at some point today.

The drastic measure has sparked a range of reactions of social media, including some from fellow members of Mr Debroux's socialist Sp.a party.

'Not OK, what happened in Landen. Really not OK,' said former minister Freya Van den Bossche.
