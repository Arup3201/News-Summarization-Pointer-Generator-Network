Danny Welbeck began his Arsenal career on Wednesday with the chance of proving he can be a top-flight middle man.

The Gunners squad took part in a training session  ahead of Saturday lunchtime's Premier League clash with Manchester City.

Following his heroics for England on Monday night, Welbeck trained at Arsenal's London Colney HQ for the first time since his £16million move from Manchester United. However, the striker took part in a behind closed doors gym session while his new team-mates took to the field.

Get shirty: Arsenal snapped up Danny Welbeck for £16m from Manchester United on transfer deadline day

The 23-year-old spent Tuesday settling into London life after spending 15 years at Old Trafford.

And he will immediately be presented with the chance to stake a claim to be the club's first-choice central striker in training.

Welbeck sees his long-term future playing as a centre forward despite being utilised as a wide man for much of his career.

And manager Arsene Wenger wants to utilise his new signing in that position in training this week ahead of Saturday's clash against Manchester City.

Given Olivier Giroud's four month lay off with an ankle injury, Welbeck will be given ample opportunity to prove he can play in that role for the Gunners in the Premier League and Champions League.

But Welbeck will not have sole ownership of that central striker role he craves, with Wenger still keen to give much-maligned striker Yaya Sanogo a chance to prove he can still make an impact for his side.
