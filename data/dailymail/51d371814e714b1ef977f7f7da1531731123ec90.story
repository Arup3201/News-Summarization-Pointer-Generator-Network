Italy boss Antonio Conte has suggested that he was Manchester United's prime target last year before they appointed Louis van Gaal as their new manager.

The Red Devils were in search of a new man in the Old Trafford hotseat following the ill-fated reign of David Moyes and then Ryan Giggs' short stint as caretaker manager until the end of the season, once the former was sacked in April.

Both Conte and Van Gaal were available to work elsewhere ahead of this campaign as the duo left Juventus and Holland respectively.

'The English team that looked for me ended up signing the Coach of a national team,' Conte told TV show Grand Hotel Chiambretti.

'But my challenge with the national team is personal. Becoming a Coach where usually the job is to select players, it is inspiring.'

The 45-year-old subsequently was appointed the manager of his national side in August - where he has led Italy to five wins and one defeat in his first six games in charge.
