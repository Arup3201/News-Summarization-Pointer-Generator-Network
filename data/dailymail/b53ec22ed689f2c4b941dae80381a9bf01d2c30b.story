James Milner has won the Premier League and played in the World Cup, but admitted that neither of those things have affected him in the way that parenthood has.

The Manchester City midfielder became a father for the first time this season, and the former Leeds man revealed that although it's far from easy, he's thoroughly enjoying the experience. 

Speaking to The Sun, Milner said: 'Having a child is massive in your life and changes you as a person, but I'm loving every minute of it.

'It's the biggest thing you can go through, a great thing that so many people experience. I'm in hotels the night before games and there is no problem with the football side - but away from that you do your bit.'

Milner is enjoying arguably his finest season since moving to the Etihad Stadium, but worryingly for City supporters his contract expires at the end of the season and he is yet to agree fresh terms.

Liverpool and Arsenal are among the teams to have shown an interest in the 29-year-old, but his recent run in the team may help to convince him to stay put.

He said: 'I've played more games this season, which helps. Some people have come up to me and asked what's different this season and I just say it's hard to play well when you're sitting on the bench. I'm confident that if I get playing time, I will play well.'
