A police officer shot and blinded in one eye during an arrest has posted a moving video diary of his recovery  - describing the attack as “one of those things.”

Police sergeant Jon King, 48, was blasted twice in the face at close range after he and his colleagues were called to help paramedics detain a man under the Mental Health Act.

The officer, who has 26 years’ service with the force, now faces the possibility of his career being over after being blinded in his right eye.

Speaking for the first time since the attack, he said: “I thought at first I was dead and the man had blown half my head off.

“I was too scared to touch my face in case it wasn’t there.

“It was dark but he was about 6ft away from me when he shot me. It knocked me straight off my feet.

“When I got up and went past him he shot me again in the other eye but thankfully it just grazed it. He was arrested and I was taken to hospital.

“When I was told I’d lost my right eye and might lose the sight in my left I thought immediately of David Rathband who was blinded by Raul Moat a couple of years ago.

“I remember saying to a nurse ‘if I’m blind in both eyes I’m going to jump out the window’ and the way I felt at that moment I was serious.

“Luckily, I can see out my left eye and, although my career might be over, I feel incredibly lucky that it wasn’t a lot worse.” 

The officer, who has racked up four commendations, including two bravery awards over his career, has started a video blog chronicling his recovery.

Just hours after he uploaded it to YouTube on Thursday night it attracted a staggering 1,500 hits from people across the globe.

On the video, which he filmed at his home in Cannock, Staffs., he said: “Hi everyone this is part one of my video adventure really.

“I am a police officer who was shot two weeks ago in this eye (points to right eye) with a gas powered handgun.

“Shot a little hard rubber bullet which went straight into my eye which basically smashed my eyeball.

“I’ve had surgery on it but I’m completely blind in it. The second shot glanced across this eye (points to left eye) just gave me bleed in it.

“This eye is OK and the bleed has gone. I think I’m going to have a prosthetic eye and what I will want to do is just post some videos up as we go along.

“I’ve got an appointment in two weeks with a plastics team and then they are going to see what they can do for me.

“So in a couple of weeks I’ll come back on and give you an update.

“I’m not really going to go into the shooting side of it, that will be dealt with at court.

“It’s just one of those things.

“I’ve got 26 years’ service and those sort of things just happen.

“So I will get back and put another one on and hopefully we’ll see some progress with this thing (points to right eye)

“Thanks for watching.”

 A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of “disengaging an air weapon” during the disturbance in Tyler Close, Rugeley, Staffordshire., at 7.30pm on October 19.

Sgt King was rushed to the trauma unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the attack where surgeons battled to save his sight.

Medics were unable to save his right eye and warned him he might lost the sight in his left after the second bullet grazed the back of it.

The father-of-four, who is married to Lisa, 43, a detective constable for Staffordshire CID, added: “I absolutely love my job but I always knew something like this would happen one day.

“If you put yourself in the frontline for 26 years, you will get hurt at some point. The fact my career, certainly in the frontline, is almost certainly over is a massive blow.

“I just hope by putting my video blogs online I will be able to look back in the future and see how far I’ve come.”

Shortly after the attack, Chief Inspector Stephen Morrey, of Staffordshire Police, condemned the shooting, saying Sgt King was injured “doing his duty.”
