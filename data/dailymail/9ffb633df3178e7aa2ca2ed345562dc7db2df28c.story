A bereaved and angered father has attacked the suspected drunken driver allegedly responsible for his son's death after following him into in a men's room inside a Florida courthouse.

Juan Gonzalez Sr, 56, was arrested Monday and charged with two counts of battery for allegedly ambushing defendant John Powers and his friend. 

Powers, 54, emerged from the restroom after the beating with blood dripping from his left ear down his neck and onto his white button-down shirt.

Bereaved dad: Juan Gonzalez, 56, is questioned at the Broward Courthouse after being accused of attacking the man allegedly responsible for his son's death in a 2011 car crash

The bloodied defendant at once reported the assault to Broward Circuit Judge Marc Gold, who then ordered the arrest of Mr Gonzalez.

The father allegedly trailed his son's suspected killer when he left the courtroom to use the bathroom, struck him several times and knocked him to the ground.

'You killed my son,' Mr Gonzalez allegedly told Powers, according to Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 'I will be watching you.' 

The man's son, Juan Manuel Gonzalez Jr , was fatally injured June 12, 2011, after being involved in a collision at State Road 7 and Orange Drive in Davie.

According to an arrest report, an inebriated John Powers attempted to make a U-turn from northbound State Road 7, forcing Gonzalez, who was riding his motorcycle southbound, to slam on the brakes in order to avoid hitting the vehicle.

As a result, Gonzalez's Suzuki bike skidded and crashed into Powers' Jeep. The biker was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries the following day.

Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was nearly twice the legal limit, according to the report.

The 54-year-old is facing DUi manslaughter and manslaughter with an unlawful blood alcohol level. He pleaded not guilty during his arraignment yesterday.

During the hearing, Powers and his friend, 59-year-old Jay Israel, went to the men's room directly outside the courtroom, where they were confronted by Gonzalez.

Israel later recounted to deputies that the angered man grabbed him by the throat before turning his attention to Powers, whom he punched several times in the head and knocked to the floor.

Gonzalez was quickly apprehended and identified by Israel and Powers as their assailant. He could face up to a year in jail if convicted of the two misdemeanor battery counts.

This was not Gonzalez’s first run-in with the law. According to records, the man was charged in 2006 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, leaving the scene of an accident and reckless driving, and sentenced to three years of probation.

Meanwhile, John Powers is due back in court in March in the fatal DUI case.
