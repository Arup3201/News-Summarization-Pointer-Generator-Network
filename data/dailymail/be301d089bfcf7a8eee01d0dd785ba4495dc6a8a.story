Steve Hirsch, founder and chairman of Vivid Entertainment, said the DVD distribution freeze is effective at once and will continue indefinitely.

A major porn studio has stopped the distribution of a sex tape starring Mindy McCready following the singer's suicide.

Steve Hirsch, founder and chairman of Vivid Entertainment, said the DVD distribution freeze is effective at once and will continue indefinitely.

The tape, called the Baseball Mistress, featured McCready and her boyfriend at the time but it is not known exactly when it was shot.

It was originally released by Vivid in 2010, after the singer appeared on Celebrity Rehab.

In the tape, McCready discusses her 
alleged affair with married baseball legend Roger Clemens, although the 
singer said she never authorised the tape's release.

Hirsch said it would be harder to 
regulate the footage appearing online but that he planned to pull all
copies of the video from the Vivid website immediately, according to TMZ.

Mindy McCready is the fifth former 
contestant on 'Celebrity Rehab' who died within three years of appearing
on the television show.

Since the country star was found at her cabin in Arkansas, the reality show 
that she starred in has come under increased scrutiny.

However,
McCready herself was possibly under scrutiny at the time of her death.

Police were reportedly planning to question her about the death last month 
of her boyfriend David Wilson, who was shot at the same Heber Spring, 
Arkansas, home where McCready died.

It was revealed on Monday that McCready had been working on a suicide awareness video right before her death.

Private investigator Danno Hanks told E! News the 37-year-old had asked him to work on a cover of I'll See You Yesterday which was written by Courtney Dashe, a fan of McCready's who wanted her to sing the song.

Then on Saturday, the day before she was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at her Arkansas home, she sent him a frame for a video with a suicide hotline number.

He said: 'She said she wanted to put 
together this video to help people deal when someone had suffered a 
suicide in their life and God, she was literally having me write her 
suicide note.

If I had known, I would have made 
sure someone was there with her all the time. I thought she was talking 
about sending a message about suicide for David's death but this is 
unbelievable.

'She was sending me a message. I wish I had been more alert to what it 
was. I just didn't think she would do this. She had two kids to live 
for. I still can't fathom the whole thing.'

McCready was also facing public scrutiny over the death of Wilson on January 13.

Sheriff's deputies investigating the case had said the death was suspicious. They were planning to re-interview before she died, People magazine reports.

McCready denied having anything to do with his death - calling David Wilson her 
'soulmate' - but police said unanswered questions remain.

McCready
was allegedly in the house at the time of his death but she allegedly 
did not hear the gun shot because the television was too loud.

Following Wilson's death, she 
attended court-ordered rehab and her two sons were put into foster care,
and they remained in the custody of the state at the time of her death.

Yellow crime-scene tape blocks off the home of Mindy McCready in Heber Springs, Arkansas on Monday, February 18, 2013, the day after the country singer was found dead there Sunday in an apparent suicide

On her bio page from 
Celebrity Rehab's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems 
and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships.

Her
biography on the show's page says: 'Although she was arrested and 
jailed for trying to buy OxyContin with a false prescription and 
attempted suicide with an overdose of drugs and alcohol, Mindy believes 
her only true addiction is to violent relationships.'
