Yoga classes, coffee shops, artisan bakeries and gyms – Tesco is trying to turn its supermarkets into the sort of place families might visit for a day out.

Its bosses fear customers have effectively rejected the chain’s Extra hypermarkets as vast, soulless warehouses.

In response, revamped stores will have the supermarket equivalent of village halls: community spaces for customers to use free of charge for activities such as yoga, baby gym and cookery classes.

New breed: The Watford branch of Tesco is trialling the scheme, which will see everything from restaurants to yoga rooms added to stores

Britain’s biggest retailer is trying to replicate the town centre of the past, with a vibrant mix of independent traders, each with its own character and appeal, but relying on Tesco’s own food and leisure brands.

These include the high street restaurant chain Giraffe, which was bought this year for  £50million, and the burgeoning coffee shop brand Harris + Hoole.

Named after a shop mentioned in the 1664 diary of Samuel Pepys, its website calls it ‘a family affair’, but it is 49 per cent owned by Tesco, which gets to keep a good chunk of the profits.

Another new name in the Tesco stable is the bakery business Euphorium, which taps into the current fixation with baking and will offer freshly made artisan bread, celebration cakes and pastries.

Also included are a pharmacy, optician, health products shop and nail bar.

The first of the new-look sites, in Watford,  was revealed yesterday to positive reaction from retail analysts and shoppers.

The revamp is a major strategy shift for Tesco, which became Britain’s richest retailer by creating an empire of bricks- and-mortar outlets.

The hypermarkets were built to sell everything from washing machines to garden furniture. But now families buy these big items on the internet and Tesco has cancelled a planned 100 new stores in what it calls the ‘end of the  space race’.

Managing director Chris Bush said yesterday: ‘Watford represents a fundamental change  in the way  people are doing their shopping. It offers us a glimpse into what stores of the future might look like.’ 

But praise was not universal. One critic tweeted: ‘This new Tesco store just looks like an absolute mish-mash mess. Either go for the fully bespoke look or don’t.’
