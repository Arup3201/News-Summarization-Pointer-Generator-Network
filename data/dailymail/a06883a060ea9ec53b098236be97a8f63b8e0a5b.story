President Obama personally apologized on Thursday to the millions of Americans who have lost their individual health insurance plans as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act becoming law.

'I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,' the president said.

'We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them, and that we’re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.'

Obama's surprising mea culpa came during a wide-ranging interview with NBC News.

President Obama personally apologized Thursday to Americans who have lost their health insurance after he promised more than two dozen times that it would never happen

Millions of Americans have lost their individual health insurance plans since the Affordable Care Act became law, and a website called mycancellation.com is publishing the bad-news letters

He promised Americans more than two dozen times during and after his two presidential campaigns that 'if you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan' under his landmark health insurance overhaul.

'First of all, I meant what I said,' he insisted during Thursday's interview with NBC reporter Chuck Todd, 'and we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented that properly

'But obviously we didn't do a good enough job. And I regret that.'

Obama ultimately dissembled, though, blaming Americans' anger and late-night comedians' jokes on a lack of clarity – not on a politically expedient lie.

'I regret very much that what we intended 
to do – which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans 
because they want 'em, as opposed to because they're forced into it – that, you know, we weren't as clear as we needed to be.'

'Hey B! You lied,' wrote one North Carolina cancellation victim. He said BlueCross was the only participant in his health care marketplace, resulting in a plan costing $4,000 more per year with a higher deductible

Cancellation letters have hit an estimated 2.5 million Americans, and some analysts predict a total near 12 million by year's end

The president also repeated an explanation that his spokespersons have articulated often in recent weeks: that only '5 per cent of the population, in what's called the individual market' were affected by the rash of cancellations that some analysts predict will top 12 million.

The Denver Post reported Thursday that 250,000 people in Colorado alone are in that group.

'A lot of these plans' that they're losing, Obama claimed for the third time in two weeks, 'are sub-par plans.'

He seemed to acknowledge for the first time, however, that some Americans were content with those insurance policies.

'Folks since then have bought subpar plans' on their own, Obama conceded.

'And now that may be all they can afford.'

He also claimed that many people with cancelled policies will find better and cheaper options in the government-run exchanges than they did before the federal government began to control the market.

'The majority of folks will end up being better off,' Obama said.

'Of course, because the website's not working right, they don't necessarily know it, right?
