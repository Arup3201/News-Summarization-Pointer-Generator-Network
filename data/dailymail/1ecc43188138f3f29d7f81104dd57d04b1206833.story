A Belgian woman, aged 105, and in unbearable pain is believed to be the oldest person ever to choose to die by euthanasia.

Germaine de Koninck whose death by a lethal injection was revealed today chose to end her long life because she was in constant pain and could no longer bear living in a care home and seeing her friends die one by one.

Her daughter Greta, 82, who was with her mother when she died, said yesterday: ‘She could not hear well, could hardly read and spent years in a wheelchair.

Mrs de Koninck died surrounded by three of her grandchildren and other family members. ‘It was all so tender, so peaceful. It was just beautiful,’ her daughter said  (File photo)

‘She also had poor blood circulation which caused her severe pain.

‘When people congratulated her on her long life she would reply: “Thanks but I hope you don't have to live as long as me.”

‘And when other people living in the same corridor in the home passed away she would say: “Why isn't it me?"

Greta added: ‘My mother's wish for euthanasia was approved by the authorities in August. It was as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.’

Mrs de Koninck died surrounded by three of her grandchildren and other family members. ‘It was all so tender, so peaceful. It was just beautiful,’ her daughter said.

Belgium's controversial euthanasia laws now result in about one in 50 deaths in the country; a total of 1,432 people died in 2012. Among them were 44-year-old twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, who were both deaf and going blind.

Another case involved a man whose sex change operation went wrong. ‘I don't want to be a monster,’ he said.

The law can be applied in cases of unbearable physical or mental problems, backed up by medical evidence from a doctor.
