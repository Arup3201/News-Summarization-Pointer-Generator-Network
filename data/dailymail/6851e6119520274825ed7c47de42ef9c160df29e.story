The Navy has now decided to scrap the USS Miami due to budget cuts instead of fixing the nuclear submarine, which a civilian shipyard worker set fire to in 2012 because he wanted to go home early.

Navy officials said repairing the Groton, Connecticut-based sub would have meant canceling work on dozens of other ships because of new budget constraints into which the Miami’s $450 million repairs just won’t fit.

While Navy officials said the military's overall readiness would be compromised if the Miami were given precedence over so many other ships, several representatives in Congress were quick to criticize the decision.

‘The Navy and the nation simply cannot afford to weaken other fleet readiness in the way that would be required to afford repairs to Miami,’ said Rear Admiral Rick Breckenridge, director of undersea warfare.

Pricey: Casey James Fury is now serving 17 years in federal prison after admitting he intentionally set the fire that caused $450 million in damage to the USS Miami

The Navy originally said it planned to repair the submarine but the discovery of additional damage raised the cost.

The Los Angeles-class attack sub was commissioned in 1990 at a cost of $900 million

Shipyard worker Casey James Fury, of 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was sentenced to 17 years in prison after 
admitting he set fire to the Miami, which was in dry dock during a 
20-month overhaul at the Kittery shipyard.

He said at the time that he was suffering from anxiety and having problems with his ex-girlfriend and set the blaze in order to get out of work early.

It took 12 hours and the efforts of more than 100 firefighters to extinguish the flames. Seven people were hurt.

The fire, set on May 23, 2012, 
damaged forward compartments including living quarters, a command and 
control center and the torpedo room. Weapons had been removed for the 
repair, and the fire never reached the rear of the submarine, where the 
nuclear propulsion components are located.

U.S.
Senators Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine and Jeanne Shaheen and 
Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire issued a statement blaming the decision to
scrap the submarine on the automatic budget cuts known as 
sequestration.

‘We are 
disappointed by the Navy's decision to discontinue repairs to the USS 
Miami. Inactivating the Miami will mean a loss to our nuclear submarine 
fleet — yet another unfortunate consequence of the across-the-board cuts
known as sequestration. We will continue to work together to find a 
responsible budget solution that replaces sequestration,’ they said.

Critics: Several U.S. lawmakers criticized the Navy's decision. 'Yet another unfortunate consequence of the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration,' wrote Senators Collins and Ayotte, among others

The Navy announced last summer that it intended to repair the Miami with a goal of returning it to service in 2015. The Navy said it would be cost-effective because the 23-year-old submarine could serve another 10 years.

The decision to inactivate the Miami was a difficult one, ‘taken after hard analysis and not made lightly,’ Breckenridge said in his statement. ‘But in exchange for avoiding the cost of repairs, we will open up funds to support other vital maintenance efforts, improving the wholeness and readiness of the fleet.’

The repairs have potential implications for both Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers and workers from Electric Boat in Groton, who expected to play a major role in the repair effort.

U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, whose Maine district includes the shipyard, blamed the submarine's loss on Congress' inability to come up with a budget.

‘It's outrageous that the yard won't get the chance to put the Miami back in service because of sequestration,’ she said.
