It was the legendary Tudor manor that came to epitomise the  ruthless world of Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell and inspired Hilary Mantel's novel Wolf Hall.

But while the timber-framed medieval house Henry's third wife Jane Seymour once called home has been lost to history, a family home still exists on the estate depicted in the BBC's historical drama - complete with underground passages, creaking floorboards and even a ghost.

Wolf Hall Manor, in Burbage, Wiltshire, stands close to the site of the Seymour family seat and is named after the original house. But the royal knights and regal splendour have gone - replaced by trampolines and wonky basketball hoops in the manor's overgrown garden. 

This is Wolf Hall Manor, which stands close to the site of the Tudor mansion which Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour called home

The timber-framed medieval house that was home to the Seymours has been lost to history, but a family house still exists on the estate depicted in the BBC's historical drama - complete with underground passages, creaking floorboards and even a ghost

The property is now home to the Binney family, three brothers and a sister, who have not seen any of the series staring Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as Cromwell, and admit the house is now a 'bit of a mess'.

The 12-bedroom manor passed to Dominic Binney, 30, and his siblings Theo, 25, Orlando, 23, and Genevieve, 20, when their mother passed away in 2013.

Dominic, who grew up in Wolf Hall Manor, is now working to clear and clean the estate.

'The house has been neglected a bit over the last 10 years,' he said. 'We've got lots of bills to pay and lots of work to do to the house.

The original Wolf Hall was inhabited by servants after the Seymours left and became increasingly dilapidated until it was largely demolished in 1665 to build nearby Tottenham House for the Seymours before the turn of the century

'To be honest, I feel too young to be running this place. We are just trying to clean up the house and not because of the attention.

'It's not collapsing but the whole place is going to be shaped up. The garden needs a lot of seeing to.

'Tenants did what they wanted and we need to change it all. It's a bit of a mess to be honest and it's now time to clean up.'

Like Wolf Hall Manor, Dame Hilary's novel is named after the Seymour's original home, also called Wulfhall. 

Henry VIII stayed there in the summer of 1535 - when Jane caught his eye, prompting the king to begin wooing her and plotting the demise of second wife Anne Boleyn after this visit, according to historians.

According to historians, Henry VIII stayed at Wolf Hall in the summer of 1535 - when Jane, played in the BBC drama by Kate  Philips, caught his eye

The meeting was shown on last week's Wolf Hall episode, but sparked comments from some fans who complained over the language used - notably the use of the C-word during a discussion between courtiers about Jane.

As the king looked out of the window at his future bride, he mused: 'Does not Mistress Seymour have the tiniest hands?'

While he walked away, courtiers mocked him behind his back, with one saying: 'Does she not have the whitest throat?'

At that point, one nobleman joked: ‘Has she not got the wettest c*** you ever groped?’

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Wolf Hall is broadcast after the watershed and the language in this powerful scene was taken from Hilary Mantel’s original text.'

Local folklore says the royal couple held a celebratory wedding feast in Wolf Hall's gigantic barn, before the Seymours abandoned their home in the late 16 century for nearby Tottenham House.

'We don't know what happened here - good things, bad things,' said Dominic.

'What secrets buried in the dirt, you just don't know. A lot of the men who lived here were apparently beheaded.

'Over the years we have had many people feeling a presence here that makes their hair stand on end - something that is definitely not explained by an old house's sounds and creaky floorboards.

'I've absolutely felt and heard unexplained things. We had mediums and psychics come here to chase the ghosts away.' 

There is no surviving picture of Wolf Hall as King Henry saw it, but historians believe it was a timber-framed house with a long gallery, chapel, kennel and a tower.

The accompanying ancient barn, which was said to have the original hooks that decorations and tapestries had hung from, lasted longer than the house, but burnt down in the 1920s.

The red brick Wolfhall Farmhouse, 200 metres away from the current Wolf Hall Manor, is a listed building for its 16th century origins - notably tall, Tudor chimneys.

The original Wolf Hall was inhabited by servants after the Seymours  left and became increasingly dilapidated until it was largely demolished in 1665 to build nearby Tottenham House for the Seymours before the turn of the century.

'We are not quite sure where the original house was,' Dominic's grandmother Anne Elizabeth Binney, 88, said. 'We are all a bit confused.'

Dominic's grandparents first acquired the house in 1940s, and the family believe the 4ft high underground passages leading from the house  might connect to  Tottenham House.

'People say the passageways are Tudor. They're older than the foundations of this building,' Dominic said.

Over the last ten years, the house fell into disrepair as his mother struggled to maintain it.

Seven people live in the main house, which has been partitioned for tenants and several families live in other estate buildings.

The four foot high passageways are believed to be Tudor, and pre-date the rest of the house, including its foundations

Washing lines with colourful pegs traverse the front lawn, in which one tenant has planted gnomes.

A dragon and a witches broom also greet visitors at Wolf Hall's official front door - also courtesy of a resident - while a few trampolines and a wonky basketball hoop lie in the garden along with an old stove and a stack of chairs.

There is also an overgrown tennis court and a secret garden, encircled by ivy-covered walls - outside of which sit tenants' cars and a broken swing set.

Dominic has neither read Wolf Hall, nor watched the adaptation, which is set to reach a bloody conclusion tomorrow night.

Family grandmother Anne Binney, 88, said she 'very much' liked Dame Hilary's first book Wolf Hall and has been watching the BBC2 drama, which is also based on the novel's sequel Bring Up The Bodies

'I think it's nice it people are enjoying it. But it's fiction, it isn't genuine. I don't watch TV,' he said.

His grandmother, however, 'very much' liked Dame Hilary's first book Wolf Hall and has been watching the BBC2 drama, which is based on the novel's sequel Bring Up The Bodies.

She said: 'I don't like the television programme; I just think they get things wrong. I shall watch the rest though.

Mrs Binney bought a collection of wooden portraits of Henry VIII and his six wives - copies of Holbein pictures - when she lived in the house, which now sit above the kitchen door.

The only other remnant of Wolf Hall's Tudor past is the eerie feeling people have had in the house, although would-be treasure hunters have scoured the estate with metal detectors in the hope of finding Tudor gold

The only other remnant of Wolf Hall's Tudor past is the eerie feeling people have had in the house, although would-be treasure hunters have scoured the estate with metal detectors in the hope of finding Tudor gold.

'They haven't found anything so far but I think there is bound to be a big pot of gold hidden here somewhere,' Dominic added.

Dominic hopes that one the estate is cleaned up that they might open the gardens to the public or use the buildings to set up a petting zoo.

'Locally, we [the estate] haven't got an amazing reputation but we would like to change that,' he said.
