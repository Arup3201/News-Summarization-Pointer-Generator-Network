He's back! 'Deadbeat dad' Terry  Turnage owes at least 17 women child support in both Tennessee and Arkansas

A man dubbed 'deadbeat dad' for owing child support on 25 children to 15 different women is now wanted in another state for owing money on three more kids he fathered. 

Terry Tyrone Turnage was wanted two years ago in Memphis, Tennessee, because he owed thousands in back child support for the care of dozens of children.

Turnage, believed to be in his late thirties, has popped up again in Forrest City, Arkansas, where he owes money to at least two women, and probably a third, for children they claim were fathered by him.

The exact number of children he has fathered and the exact number of women involved remains unclear.  

Paula Stewart, 22, who has a two-year-old son by Turnage, told WREG this week: 'Everybody tells me, ''What you doing talking to him?'' 

'''How you didn’t know he had all these kids?'' Uh duh, I’ve been in school. I wasn’t out like that.'

A second woman, Miesha Davis,  found out the father of her son was 'famous' after a conversation with the child support office.

She believed that her little boy was number 26 and that Turnage had a child by another woman between her and Miss Stewart.

Turnage is known in Forrest City as a club owner who drives expensive cars and has the nickname TYB, which reportedly stands for 'Take Your B*****'.

He recently threw a 700-person birthday party over two days at his club where he boasted about spending hundreds of dollars on top-shelf champagne. 

Both Miss Stewart and Miss Davis went to the club event saying that they just went 'to have a good time' and not to see Turnage.

Turnage, who owes at least 15 women child support in Tennessee has now shown up in Arkansas where the list of mothers waiting on child support from him is growing 

During a recent child support hearing in Forrest City, Turnage did not show up for his appointment. 

In 2012, a girlfriend, who had spent nearly eight years with Turnage, said her 'knees buckled' when a prosecutor at family court told her that the father of her child had 20 other children. 

'During the whole relationship, I only knew of four children,' Latoya Shields told WREG in 2012. 

'At that time, three years ago, my child was the 21st child. Yeah, that would be overwhelming for anybody.'

In May 2012, Turnage filed a petition at Shelby County Juvenile Court to lower his child support payments for the mothers of his children - but never turned up to the hearing. 

Miss Shields said the dad has shown little interest in his daughter. 'She calls him and it's a "hi" and "bye, see you later" type of situation,' she said.

Miss Shields has only ever received checks from him between $6 and $9 dollars. He was ordered by a judge to pay her $259 dollars a month. 

A phone number linked to Turnage was disconnected on Thursday when called by MailOnline.  

Latoya Shields said in 2012 that 'her knees buckled' when she found out that Turnage, the father of her child, had at least 20 more kids
