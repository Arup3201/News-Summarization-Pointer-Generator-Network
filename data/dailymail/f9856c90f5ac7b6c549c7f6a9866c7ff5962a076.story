Staffers working on The Late Show with David Letterman have revealed the bizarre requests Bill Cosby would make before his appearances.

Sources told the New York Daily News the 77-year-old would demand that 'young girls, interns and assistants' sit down and watch him eat curry backstage in the Green Room before the interviews.

They described how no one would say anything, but the comedian allegedly would still make them stay until he finished his meal. He last appeared on the CBS talk show in January.

As historic sexual assault allegations against Cosby continue to resurface, his next scheduled appearance with Letterman was cancelled. 

He has also recently been dropped from Queen Latifah's talk show and has not commented on the allegations during interviews.

The employees told the paper that producers would make them do it because 'that’s what he (Cosby) wanted', even though they admitted not liking the pre-show scenario.

The revelations come as Cosby's 'fixer' for NBC claimed that he helped the funnyman channel star funnel thousands of dollars to a virtual harem of young women he kept as the The Cosby Show was filmed. 

Frank Scotti, 90, told the Daily News on Sunday that he acted as a conduit through whom the actor sent lady pals funds and as a guard at Cosby's dressing room door when those women visited.

After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby.

One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father.

In recent days, 15 women have gone public accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them. His lawyer Martin Singer has said branded the stories 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity.

In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.'

The comedian, who has been performing on stage despite the resurgence of allegations, stayed silent during a radio interview with NPR and pressured the Associated Press not to broadcast an interview where he was asked about the rape allegations.

He was given two standing ovations when he appeared before an enthusiastic audience in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday night.

The audience cheered as he walked on the stage and again when he completed his 90-minute performance.

Many in the audience even shouted for an encore at the end of the show, but Cosby did not reappear.

On the same day Law & Order: SVU star Michelle Hurd came forward to say that Cosby acted highly inappropriately towards her when she was a stand-in on The Cosby Show, and claimed that she knows of one woman on set who woke up drugged at his apartment.

Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions.

Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967.
