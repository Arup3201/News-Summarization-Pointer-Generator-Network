What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

Beating New Zealand. If England can beat the world’s best with a depleted team their World Cup credentials would be hard to argue with.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

Semesa Rokoduguni. If he can reproduce his club form he could be a hugely exciting addition.

Semesa Rokoduguni has the chance to be the man everyone is talking about after the Autumn internationals

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

Owen Farrell. I’m a huge fan but he needs to show he can play that flat, attacking game at No 10 that would unleash England’s backs.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

Israel Folau. An incredible athlete and one of the most destructive broken-field runners in the game.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

I expect Wales to beat Australia. It is high time they took a southern hemisphere scalp.

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

New Zealand, South Africa, Australia

Owen Farrell has a point to prove over November, and can help release England's backs at Twickenham

Neil Back (England World Cup winning flanker)

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

With some luck we could win all four, but the important thing is to at least stay within a score.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

We’ve got plenty of pace and it can all by bolstered by Brad Barritt doing the basics really well.

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

There is a lot of focus on Chris Robshaw, he’s got to go out there and prove that he is the best number seven.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

Julian Savea’s scoring record against England is phenomenal.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

I think Wales and Ireland will both beat one of the teams ranked above them.

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

Epic acid test.

Julian Savea’s scoring record against England is phenomenal, will it continue at Twickenham?

Maggie Alphonsi (England World Cup winner)

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

Four out of four would be ideal but England are quite slow starters. Opening against New Zealand will be a massive challenge, so I think we will settle for three wins.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

It’s got to be the Fijian soldier, Semesa Rokoduguni. He’s been playing really well at Bath and it’s a bold but exciting call to give him a debut against the All Blacks.

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

It’s a massive opportunity for Kyle Eastmond to show what he’s about. There were some good signs in New Zealand but he wasn’t at his best in the final Test, so I think he will have a point to prove.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

As a back row I’m looking forward to seeing Kieran Read for New Zealand. He’s the best No 8 in the world and his ball handling skills are fantastic to watch.

Kyle Eastmond showed his potential in the summer against the All Blacks, and has the chance again

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

Wales are a quality side and Australia are on form, almost beating New Zealand, but I think Warren Gatland’s lot could definitely edge that one out.

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

Testing, physical and exciting.

Serge Betsen (France legend)

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

If they beat the All Blacks, they will have the belief to win all four.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

Billy Vunipola; he made his debut alongside me at Wasps and when he told me he was born in 1992 I realised it was time to retire! He is a fantastic player.

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

My old mate James Haskell is back near the squad. He is taking the challenge really seriously to be part of the World Cup.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

Sonny Bill Williams was my roommate in the Barbarians and I’m really excited to see him back.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

I don’t see Scotland beating the All Blacks!

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

Exhausting, exciting, enjoyable.

Chris Foy

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

Winning three matches out of four - based on one victory against either New Zealand or South Africa, before beating Samoa and Australia.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

It has to be Semesa Rokoduguni, as the new addition to the back line who can provide power, pace, nifty footwork and finishing class.

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

After an injury-hit start to the season, there will be a big onus on Owen Farrell to justify his status as first-choice No 10.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

For open-field audacity, thrills and spills, Israel Folau of Australia. For aggression and hard-edged physicality, the Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

Wales have a decent shot against the Wallabies, as have Ireland

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

North-south divide.

Sam Peters

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

Anything less than three wins from four will leave serious question marks over next year’s World Cup.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

Kyle Eastmond. Tiny by international standards but has quick feet and a superb eye for space.

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

Tom Wood. One of the fittest players in squad and undeniably a leader of men but has turned over too much ball in recent Tests.

Tom Wood has a point to prove in November after failing to live up to his potential in recent Tests

Which visiting player will excite us most?

Conrad Smith. The All Black outside centre doesn’t fit the physical mould of a modern-day centre but is clever, inventive and brave.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

Wales and Ireland need to overcome hoodoo in this series to avoid chokers tag.

Sum up the autumn internationals in three words.

Daunting. Exciting. Brutal.

Nik Simon

What would constitute a good Autumn for England?

Three wins from four – anything less is a failure. A victory against the All Blacks would send out the strongest statement.

Which England player should we be most excited about?

Bath’s Anthony Watson has moved above Marland Yarde in selection and has pace to burn.

Anthony Watson of Bath has overtaken Marland Yarde in the pecking order for England

And which one has the biggest point to prove?

Owen Farrell has had a difficult start to the season and Danny Cipriani will feel aggrieved if he doesn’t come up trumps.

Which visiting player will excite us most?

Young South African fly half Andre Pollard.

Can the other home nations take down a big gun?

Australia’s recent turmoil could give Wales their break on Saturday
