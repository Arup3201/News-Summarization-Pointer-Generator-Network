Officials investigating the victimisation of NHS whistleblowers have been deluged by comments from thousands of concerned staff.

They were meant to publish their findings two months ago but have repeatedly had to push back the date because so many people have got in touch.

The review is being overseen by the leading barrister Sir Robert Francis QC, who produced two reports into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal.

So far, the review team has received 17,500 online responses and 600 by post – although some individuals may have got in touch more than once.

Meanwhile, a critical report by MPs on the Health Select Committee warns that despite some improvements, many staff are still too scared to raise concerns and have been put off by the experiences of others.

The report concludes: ‘The treatment of whistleblowers is a stain on the reputation of the NHS and has led to unwarranted, inexcusable pain for the courageous individuals affected.’

The Mail has long campaigned for the protection of whistleblowers and earlier this month revealed how a senior cancer doctor had been gagged by his hospital. 

Professor Joseph Meirion Thomas was put on two weeks’ gardening leave by the Royal Marsden Hospital in London after writing two critical articles about the NHS.

The review into whistleblowing was ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last summer over concerns that many NHS staff were still too afraid to speak out.

Often those who implicate more senior colleagues when they raise concerns of poor care are bullied, disciplined or forced out of their job.

Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘We’re not saying that everyone who raises concerns in the NHS suffers harm as a result. But there have been a number of high profile cases where that has happened.

‘There is evidence that for those professionals thinking of raising concerns, the fear of how that might impact on their career is still acting as a deterrent in coming forward. The system needs to continue to change.’

MPs also wants to make it easier for patients and families to complain by setting up a ‘one-stop’ helpline and website.

Dr Kim Holt, a paediatrician who raised the alarm at the clinic which failed to spot abuse of Baby P, said: ‘The treatment of some staff has undermined patient safety, as there is a lack of trust in the system.

‘People have lost faith that they will be properly supported and protected – fear is pervasive.’

Two years ago Mr Hunt promised to make it easier for staff to raise concerns by launching a whistleblowing helpline and pledging to end gagging orders.

These are payments made to employees to keep them quiet when they are dismissed from hospitals after speaking out.

Last year the Mail highlighted the case of cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu, whose NHS trust had spent £10million trying to silence him after he warned of patients dying on overcrowded wards.

He was suspended from Coventry’s Walgrave Hospital in 2000 and later sacked but finally vindicated in April when a judge ruled he had been unfairly treated.

Yesterday Mr Hunt said: ‘We want to make the NHS the safest healthcare system in the world and we know that listening to patients and staff is absolutely vital to improve care.’

÷A whistleblower paramedic who was banned from two hospitals after warning that patients were being treated in corridors has had the restriction lifted. Stuart Gardner was told by managers that he was ‘not welcome’ at either hospital after stating that conditions at Worcestershire Royal Hospital were the worst he had seen in 26 years. He told the BBC that at one point there were 18 patients queued up on trolleys.

Yesterday Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospitals, the Royal in Worcester and Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, backed down.

It said in a statement: ‘Unison and the Trust have agreed that the Trust does not have the authority to exclude an individual paramedic from its premises and the paramedic has received an apology for the suggestion that he should be excluded.’ 

Final embrace: Lisa Mpongwana, 27, and her husband Mthuthuzeli, 38,  after she made the decision to switch off his life-support machine - she claims he would still be alive if there had not been an ambulance delay

This harrowing picture shows the pain of a wife with her dying husband after he waited more than five hours for an ambulance.

 Lisa Mpongwana, 27, and her husband Mthuthuzeli, 38, are locked in a final embrace after she made the heart-breaking decision to switch off his life-support machine.

He died from meningitis after falling unconscious in an ambulance which arrived at his home over five hours after his wife first called the emergency services.

Mrs Mpongwana claims he would still be alive today without the delay.

She said she first called 111 between 10.30pm and 11pm on January 5 after her husband began showing flu-like symptoms earlier that day. 

The operator was concerned and said a blue lights ambulance would be sent. 

However, nothing happened until 1.18am when a lone paramedic arrived in a car and then called for an ambulance. 

But the ambulance did not arrive until 4.30am, by which point Mr Mpongwana was fading and became unresponsive during the journey to the Bristol Royal Infirmary.

Mrs Mpongwana spent the morning of January 7 in the arms of her husband before giving her consent for his life-support machine to be switched off.

She decided to release the photograph – taken by a relative at the hospital – to raise awareness of meningitis. 

Mrs Mpongwana said: ‘People need to see the hurt I went through.’

South Western Ambulance Service has apologised for the hold-up blaming it on a ‘very busy time’.
