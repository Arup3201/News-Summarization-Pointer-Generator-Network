Land Rover is developing a ‘see-through’ car that gives drivers the sense of Superman-style ‘X-ray eyes’ to look beyond the metal at what dangers lurk beneath their vehicles.

The system combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  ‘transparent’ bonnet.

Although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices  when they take their 4X4s seriously off-road, it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight.

The pioneering technology is to be showcased next week at the New York International Auto Show on a prototype off-roader called ‘Discovery Vision’ which signals the design direction of a new next generation ‘family’ of Land Rover Discoveries.

Land Rover bosses said the system is being developed to give Land Rover drivers a ‘digital vision’ of the terrain ahead by making the front of the car ‘virtually invisible’ and is expected to become an option on future models.

The system acts like an electronic periscope to project image from below the car onto the windscreen in front of the driver.

Cameras in the vehicle’s grille capture mobbing pictures of the state of the road or terrain immediately ahead.

This video image is then transmitted 
digitally to a Head-Up Display of the type already used on many luxury 
and executive cars to project sat-nav and speed  details onto the 
windscreen.

The virtual image of the ground is superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet. This
 allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently 
‘see-through’ the front of the car.

The virtual image of the ground is thus superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet.

This allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘see-through’ the front of the car and its engine bay onto the road below,  as if with x-ray eyes.

The technology has been called Transparent Bonnet by its creators and is expected to be offered as an option on future models.

A Land Rover spokesman said: ‘The technology provides full visibility of what is underneath and in front of the car, with total clarity of otherwise hidden obstacles.’

He added: ‘It enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels.

‘It breaks new ground in visual driver assistance. And it shows how advanced technology will take Land Rover’s unrivalled capability to the next level.’

Jaguar Land Rover’s director of research and technology Dr Wolfgang Epple said: ‘As our vehicles become more capable and autonomous off-road, we will ensure the driver has the confidence to allow the car to continue to progress, over any terrain.

‘We are developing new technologies including the Transparent Bonnet to give drivers an augmented view of reality to help them tackle anything from the toughest off-road route to the tight confines of an urban car park.’

Dr Epple said: ‘We believe the next 25 years will be the most exciting and dynamic the automotive industry has ever experienced. There will be huge strides in environmental innovation, in safety and capability.’

A spokesman said: ’It demonstrates Land Rover’s design vision for a future family of premium sports utility vehicles built on  our key principles of emotive design, unrivalled capability and ultimate versatility.

‘From the city to the sand dunes, Land Rover’s new, driver-assisting technology will enable safer, smarter and more enjoyable driving in the SUVs of tomorrow.’
