A image of cheerleaders striking poses to apparently mimic gang members has sparked an investigation at one California school district.

The Redlands East Valley High school district officials are looking into background on the photo being spread around social media, which shows the girls pretending to be pregnant, flashing gang signs, and holding simulated weapons.

KTLA reports one parent who saw the image on Facebook called it 'really sad.'

On the other hand, parent Sherry Garcia thought the concerns were disproportionate.

'I think they’re just being teenagers, having fun, being silly,' she said.

But the squad is hiatus until further notice by order of the district superintendent Lori Rhodes. 

'I find this picture offensive, and this type of depiction will not 
be tolerated,' she said in a statement. 'I  apologize that any Redland USD student 
organization would be involved in an activity of this type.'

Rhodes said she understood the shot was taken taken during an exercise to 'build team spirit and camaraderie in a positive manner' but that the squad 'should never demean, insult, or portray negative stereotypes, as done in this photo.'

Rhodes said appropriate action would be taken once an investigation was complete.

At least one of their peers believes the squad is being misjudged.

Ashley Scott, who graduated recently and knows several of the cheerleaders, told NBC Lost Angeles that any adults involved should be held responsible.

'I
 was a little disappointed in the girls, just because that's not who we 
are,' she said. 'I don't believe that any of the girls meant to do 
this on purpose, to send any kind of message to anyone.'
