Despite a lack of consistency and cutting edge, Brendan Rodgers still believes his 10th-placed Liverpool team can challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League this season.

Unfortunately for Rodgers, the history books firmly suggest otherwise with no team since the Premier League's inception finishing higher than sixth after being 10th at Christmas. 

A third decent performance in a week saw Martin Skrtel salvage a point with a header in the seventh minute of added time as they drew 2-2 with Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.

Speaking after the game, Rodgers declared: 'Can we now challenge for the top four? Yes. Absolutely. The most important thing is that we are moving in the right direction again.'

While Liverpool have at times impressed with the pace, pressing and passing which was associated with their run to second place last season, they have collected just 22 points from their 17 games which finds them languishing in mid-table.

The last club to finish as high as sixth after a spending the festive period in 10th was, in fact, Liverpool in 1993. 

During that season, with club legend Graeme Souness at the helm, Liverpool were had earned 28 points from their opening 20 games, winning eight compared to Liverpool's six victories since the start of the current campaign.

Rodgers may be backing his side to make history, but with Liverpool's frontline of Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini, Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert scoring just two Premier League goals between them so far, Reds fans will be calling out for a star striker such as Ian Rush, who bagged 14 league goals for the club during the 1992-93 campaign.

There's little doubt that Liverpool will be in far better shape after the return of injured frontman Sturridge.

In his absence others have had to weigh in with goals but they haven't done nearly enough as Skrtel's late effort against Arsenal took the club's tally to just 21 in 17 matches.

Since 1992, London trio Chelsea, Tottenham and Fulham have all spent time in 10th position at Christmas with mediocre second halves of the season to follow.

In the 22 season, only eight teams have managed to finish in a higher position than their festive spot with Newcastle and Blackburn managing to finish in seventh during their respective seasons in 2005-06 and 2007-08.

Only one team has ended up being relegated from the top flight after being mid-table ahead of the new year, with Blackpool ending their 2010-11 Premier League season in 19th position after a disastrous second half of the season.

Liverpool will not fare that badly, but fourth seems a long way away.
