A dachshund that took on a bull mastiff as it dragged a terrified 11-year-old girl down the street by her arm paid for its bravery with its life.

Police in the northern Serbian town of Pancevo said that the mastiff which is normally kept in a cage had managed to escape when the owner was away.

It had run into the street where it then attacked a girl playing on her roller skates, biting her arms and legs and dragging her back to its cage.

As she screamed for help, a man was 
walking nearby with his dachshund named Leo, which ran over and bit the mastiff on
 the leg, sparking a fight between the animals.

Leo was fatally wounded, but his intervention had allowed the girl, named Sofia Vucetic, to escape unharmed.

Eyewitness Milica Panajotovic, 35, said: 'The girl spotted the dog running towards her because it was barking, but she had no chance to get away, and it knocked her flying.

'It then grabbed her arms and legs and was biting her and then started to drag her by the arm back to its cage.

'I was just struck dumb and unable to move, and there was a man walking his Dachshund as well who seemed frozen to the spot.

'But his dog which was off the lead when it saw what was happening ran over and started barking at the bigger dog, and then tried to bite it on the leg.

'This distracted the mastiff that turned round and started fighting with the dachshund. Of course it wasn't a very even battle and the Dachshund was badly wounded.

'But the child managed to get away from the mastiff while it was attacking the Dachshund.'

As other witnesses appeared a couple took the child to safety while three men grabbed sticks and used them to drive off the mastiff.

They managed to rescue Leo, but he was badly hurt and even though a vet was called and an emergency operation carried out he was unable to do anything to save the dog.

Its owner said he had named the dog Leo because although it was tiny it had never been afraid of anything and had a heart as big as a lion.

Leo's owner said: 'Everybody loved Leo, he was so kind and playful. We will miss him terribly, but will always remember he saved a child's life. He really is a hero dog. He will never be forgotten.

'He was a really laid back dachshund, but he obviously saw the child was in danger and his natural hunting instinct kicked in and he went to attack the other dog to save the girl.'

The injured girl's mother said: 'My daughter Sofia was very scared and traumatised. Her left hand was all bitten. It was horrible.

'She was very shaken up. The dog pulled her around like a rag doll, banging her around.

'I can only imagine what could have happened if that little dog was not that brave. We were praying for the dog. He saved our daughter's life.'

Neighbours now say they want to put up a memorial to Leo so people remember the dog's bravery which ultimately led to the child's life being saved.

One said: 'We want to make sure the dog is honoured. If the dog had not jumped to the rescue the little girl could have been killed.

The child has been released from hospital and is now recovering at home.

Police confirmed they are investigating the incident.

Dachshunds are known to be playful, but as hunting dogs they can be quite stubborn, and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity.
