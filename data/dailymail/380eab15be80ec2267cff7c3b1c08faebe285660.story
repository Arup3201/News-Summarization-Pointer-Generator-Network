Wall Street markets suffered huge falls today as fears grow that Europe's plan to save the euro will unravel before it can even kick in.

Greek Premier George Papandreou said he will put Greece's bailout through a referendum, throwing the long-awaited deal into disarray.

Financial markets around the world tumbled in reaction to the shock announcement today and U.S. stocks fell by up to three per cent.

The Dow Jones closed down 295 points, or 2.5 per cent, at 11,660; the S&P 500 was down 35 points, or 2.8 per cent, at 1,218; and the Nasdaq was down 77 points, or 2.9 per cent, at 2,607.

Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy called a crisis meeting and agreed the Greek decision has made it more necessary than ever to push forward with plans thrashed out during last week's EU summit.

The German and French leaders will meet with the Greek government, the IMF and their European partners tomorrow in Cannes, ahead of a G20 summit, to push forward support for their view.

Meanwhile following a surprise meeting of the cabinet, the beleaguered Greek government shocked its nation again by sacking all of its defence chiefs for no clear reason.

‘The market did not see this Greek referendum coming, which is potentially a killer,’ said investment strategist Paul Mendelsohn. ‘It could knock the wheels off the bus of the whole (Europe rescue) plan.’

The FTSE in Britain fell two per cent, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 both plunged by a worrying five per cent in trading on Tuesday.

Most Asian stock markets fell after 
factory activity in the region's export powerhouses slowed to near 
three-year lows in October.

The falls were due to lower European demand, reinforcing fears the euro zone's debt troubles were sapping global growth.

China's factory activity last month was 
its slowest since February 2009 - an unexpected decline that reflected a
drop in new export orders.

The U.S. dollar index rose 1.5 per cent. U.S. oil futures dropped 2.7 per cent and copper prices fell 3.8 per cent.

Markets in Asia have also fallen with Japan's Nikkei closing with a 1.7 per cent drop and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing 2.5 per cent.

Mr Papandreou took many of his own 
parliament by surprise by declaring that the hard-bargained agreement 
will be put to a public ballot.

It will be Greece's first referendum since 1974, when the monarchy was abolished by a landslide vote after the collapse of a military dictatorship.

Mr Papandreou's decision means voters will be asked to approve a €100bn deal that would see 50 per cent of the country’s debts written off.

But it would also see harsh austerity measures imposed for years to come.

A ‘no’ vote would prove catastrophic for the EU and could prompt a disorderly default on the country’s debts and an exit from the euro.

One recent poll showed that 59 per cent of Greeks think the new package is ‘negative’ or ‘probably negative’ for their country.

The turmoil in Europe has also seen U.S. brokerage firm MF Global file for bankruptcy after suffering massive losses gambling on eurozone bonds.

The firm was founded by sugar broker James Man in 1783 and is now led by former New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs chief Jon Corzine.

George Papandreou said a referendum will be held in a ‘supreme act of democracy and of patriotism for the people to make their own decision’.

His announcement that the public will be
able to vote on whether to accept the latest package is being 
considered as a way to regain more popularity.

A recent opinion poll suggested that 60 per cent of Greeks were against the austerity measures that have been put forward.

But other surveys show broad support for remaining in the eurozone and investors are not hopeful that Mr Papandreou will be able to pull off a victory.

Greece's main opposition conservatives called for Mr Papandreou's resignation, accusing him of incompetence and blackmail.

The referendum is expected to be held early next year. A confidence vote in the Socialist government will also take place at the end of this week.

American-born Georgios Papandreou (left) helped cement the top political post in Greece into a dynasty as he is the third member of his family to lead the country in the last 65 years, after his father and grandfather.

Mr Papandreou has been leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party since February 2004 and became the 182nd prime minister of Greece in October 2009.

His grandfather George Papandreou Sr had three terms, between 1944 and 1945, in 1963, and then from 1964 to 1965.

While the current PM's father Andreas Papandreou (right) served two terms, from 1981 to 1989, and then from 1993 to 1996.

In two separate polls, conducted in 2007 and 2010, Mr Papandreou, who was known to the public simply as 'Andreas', was voted as the best prime minister of Greece since democracy re-emerged in 1974. It is unlikely in light of recent events that his son will challenge him for this crown.

Mr Papandreou was elected in a landslide victory where the country's conservatives suffered one of their worst ever general election results.

On the back of a huge swell of public support and an emphatic majority he promised to reinvigorate Greece's stuttering economy by pumping in three billion euros.

However it then came out that the country was in much more debt than first thought so he began to cut spending, bump-up taxes and slash public sector jobs, leading to national strikes.

Fellow eurozone members also hit out at Mr Papandreou, saying he failed to manage his economy properly. This has led to poor opinion polls and a lack of parliamentary backing.

In May, 77 per cent of the people asked said they had no faith in his handling of the Greek economic crisis and a month later he narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in parliament with a majority of two.

His announcement that the public will be able to vote on whether to accept the latest austerity package is being considered as a way to regain more popularity.

But it seems that his period in charge of the country will always be tainted by Greece's financial collapse.
