The cost of buying a house in Australia is continuing to rocket as it’s revealed Sydney’s median house price is now a staggering $811,837.

However, Australia's biggest banks are determined not to let that stop people buying and have rolled out their best ever mortgage rates.

Commonwealth Bank dropped its five-year fixed rate to below 5 per cent on Wednesday.

Soaring: Sydney's median house price is now a staggering $811,837

This means the monthly repayments on a $400,000 mortgage have been lowered by $166 a month.

The record low rate led to Westpac and National Australia Bank also slashing their repayments within an hour of the change.

NAB head of retail banking Gavin Slater told the Sydney Morning Herald he had seen an increased demand for fixed-rate products over the past year.

And it's not just Sydney house prices that are growing.

Price growth in almost all capital cities in the three months to June has helped the median Australian house price soar almost 11 per cent in just 12 months.

Cheaper: To the north of Sydney, in Mount Kuring-Gai, this house is on sale for offers over $795,000

Sydney is leading the surge, where the median house price climbed by more than $100,000 in the year to June, or 17 per cent, to hit a record $812,000.

But Melbourne recorded 10 per cent growth to $608,000, according to the latest report from Australian Property Monitors (APM).

June quarter prices showed capital city housing markets are showing no signs of slowing down, APM senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said.

'Most capital cities are maintaining or exceeding the solid to strong prices growth levels recorded during the previous quarter,' he told AAP.

'Other leading indicators of housing market activity such as home loan activity and auction clearance rates point to continued solid buyer activity through 2014.'

Canberra was the only capital city not to have an increase in house prices in 2013/14, dropping by 0.5 per cent to a median price of $576,000.

Despite strong growth in median house prices, unit prices were more varied.

Sydney's 13.3 per cent growth did pull the national average up to 8.3 per cent, but Brisbane, Canberra and Hobart all fell.

In Sydney it's not your average family who are stumping up the cash for properties, investors are the main people involved in buying at such high-prices a local real estate agent has claimed.

'We've sold two properties in the past two weeks to investors that have gone for $100,000 more than they sold for a year ago,’ principal of Belle Property Manly, Brendan Essery, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Meanwhile, thousands more homes are due to be built to meet the growing demand from an increasing population.

Construction forecasters BIS Shrapnel said that activity will reach a new high in terms of homes constructed, and ‘more of those new homes will continue to be in apartment towers’.

In their latest housing outlook this week BIS associate director Dr Kim Hawtrey said: ‘New housing starts are forecast to reach 190,000 nationwide in 2014/15, which will surpass the previous peak of around 187,000 set back in the 1994 boom.'
