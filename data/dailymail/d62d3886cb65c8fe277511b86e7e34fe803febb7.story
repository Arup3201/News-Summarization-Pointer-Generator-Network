Parents in Romania have had to undergo therapy after agreeing to watch child porn made by a star of hit reality TV show 'The Voice of Romania'â€¦ to check if their children were among those he abused.

Lucian Darie, a music teacher from Piatra Neamt, a city in north-eastern Romania, was arrested when the parents of one of the girls complained that their daughter said he had assaulted her.

Police also seized the man's computer where they found hundreds of pornographic movies mostly involving girls aged between six and seven.

But with many of the videos not showing the girls' heads, police decided the only way to identify any of the other victims was to contact the parents of girls he had taught, and ask them to view the images.

As a result, several other girls who were students of Darie were identified and the man is now due to go on trial for the sexual abuse of under-aged girls while in a position of trust.

Police confirmed that they had found DNA samples that incriminated the music teacher as a result of identifying additional alleged victims.

Police defended the decision to ask the parents to help, saying that it was the only way to make sure victims who would need help could be identified, and to make sure the arrested man was tried for all the offences when the court case starts next month.
