Five teenagers died after they were involved in a crash on Saturday night which left others injured and a road closed for more than five hours.

Three males and two females, all aged between 16 and 18, died after the crash which took place at about 9.40pm in foggy conditions on the A630 in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, approximately 650 yards from Archer Way.

The five were all travelling in the same Toyota and a man in the other car, a Seat, involved in the crash was taken to hospital with a broken leg.

A 21-year-old man from Doncaster, who police believe may have been driving a third vehicle which could have been involved, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail.

Five teenagers died after a crash on the A630 in Conisbrough near Doncaster on Saturday night. A man was taken to hospital with a broken leg and another arrested and bailed for causing death by dangerous driving

The road in South Yorkshire re-opened at about 3am today - more than five hours after the crash took place. 

The five teenagers who died were all travelling in a Toyota which collided with a Seat.

South Yorkshire Police confirmed two males and a female died last night, and a third male in the early hours of this morning. The second female was taken to hospital with critical injuries and died this morning. 

A spokeswoman said formal identification of the teenagers had not yet taken place, but they are all aged between 16 and 18 and are from the Doncaster area.

Sergeant Pete Serhatlic told BBC Radio Sheffield: 'It's absolutely horrific, it's an extremely sad situation.

'To a certain degree it's pretty unbelievable that five young people have lost their lives in an incident like this.'

 

The crash took place in Conisbrough, about 100 yards from a crash which killed three teenagers in 2011 

A man driving the Seat was taken to hospital last night with a broken leg. 

The long straight road has a 40mph speed limit on the edge of the village that is flanked by woodland and countryside.

South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service was called to the accident last night and posted on Twitter: 'We send our deepest condolences to the families affected by the fatal RTC we attended last night.'

This morning the only evidence of the crash was a South Yorkshire Police witness appeal board placed by the side of the road..

The A630 was closed for five hours as police tried to clear the road, where fragments of glass are visible 

A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been bailed 

The A630 is a long straight road with a 40mph limit and is flanked either side by trees and countryside 

One local resident out walking his dog this morning said: 'It's just terrible.

'It was foggy here last night just like it is now. It's only a few years ago that all those other kids died. Terrible.'

The scene of the crash is just over 100 yards from the location of another crash which left three teenagers dead on the same road three years ago. Two boys, aged 15 and 16, and a 14-year-old girl died when the car they were in hit a tree. Tributes to the teenagers are still visible at the site.
