For more than a century, this historic clock's chimes have been part of village life, day and night.

But they are about to be partially silenced in the latest example of health and safety gone mad – after a complaint from a couple who recently bought the house next door.

The decision in Ash, Surrey, was last night slated as a 'politically correct health-and-safety purge' by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who said he was issuing new guidance to councils to prevent it happening again.

First, Mr Tai, who works as a case manager at the Royal Courts of Justice, complained to the trust that manages Victoria Hall – the community hall on top of which the three-faced clock stands

'If people don't like the chime of a bell that has sounded for generations, they should reflect on whether they want to live next door to it in the first place or consider the merits of double glazing,' the minister told the Daily Mail.

The row began shortly after legal expert Steve Tai, 44, and his accountant wife Yong Wong, 41, moved to Ash from a nearby village last September. 

First, Mr Tai, who works as a case manager at the Royal Courts of Justice, complained to the trust that manages Victoria Hall – the community hall on top of which the three-faced clock stands. 

Then he contacted the parish council and Guildford Borough Council, threatening to sue because the chimes, which have sounded every 15 minutes since 1900, had left the couple unable to sleep and 'depressed'.

The trust was advised it would probably lose if the case went to court. So it has now had to buy a bespoke timer for £1,700 plus installation costs to stop the chimes between 11pm and 7am. 

However, in an inspiring show of community spirit, villagers have chipped in with donations to meet the fee, despite being outraged by the move.

David Brown, of the hall's management committee said: 'There's a lot of resentment that someone can come into a place and stop something that's been going on for 100 years without any real feel for the community in general. 

'People have powerful memories of the hall and the clock. It has been a venue for wedding receptions, for all sorts of events and groups. In the First World War ladies gathered there to write letters to men at the Front.'

Nigel Manning, chairman of Ash Parish Council, said: 'To my mind it's "buyer beware". You can't really miss the clock – it's 90ft tall and right next door.'

Mr Pickles's department has now drafted guidance to councils that the local character of a place should be taken into account during noise disputes. 

'In recent years, too many town halls have been over-zealous in trying to silence church bells and village clocks which have chimed for decades, if not centuries,' he said.

'We need some common sense to recognise such sounds are part of the fabric of Britain's life, rather than trying to whitewash all the character out of our heritage.' 

Mr Tai insisted he did not know the clock chimed every 15 minutes when he bought the house for £295,950 after just one viewing.

'We changed the double glazing and paid for sound-proofing but it's still not working,' he said. 'I don't think there's any point that they should chime after 11pm.'
