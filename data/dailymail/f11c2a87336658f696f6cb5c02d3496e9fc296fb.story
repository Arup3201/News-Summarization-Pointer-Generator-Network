Young widow: Chanel Reynolds has set up a website helping people to get their affairs in order to in case they unexpectedly die

A young widow has set up a website helping people to get their affairs in order in case they unexpectedly die.

Get Your S*** Together was the brainchild of Chanel Reynolds, 42, who felt after her husband was killed in an accident, the grieving process was made more traumatic by financial worries.

The website helps users to prepare for the unexpected by asking them to detail everything from email passwords to bank account codes.

It also offers practical advice telling parents to consider who would look after their children if they died.

'The trauma and grief are enough to 
completely level you – and yet, the fear about having our wills drafted 
but not signed, not knowing how much life insurance we had, not knowing 
the password to his phone so I could call his family, etc. – were often 
the things that pushed me over the edge,' she explains on her website.

Ms Reynolds' husband Jose Hernando, 43, a Flash developer, was killed in 2009 after being hit by a van near their Seattle home.

'He was set on going for a quick training ride before his last bike race of the season. I wanted him to go to a dinner party with me and our 5-year old instead,' she writes on the website.

'Our last moment together, he was being goofy and adorable, wanting me to kiss him before he left. I refused, twice. I was mad. He tried one last time and I couldn’t help smile at him and kiss him back. 

'My last words to him were, “Ok, I’ll kiss you, but I’m still mad at you.”

Killed: Ms Reynold's husband Jose Hernando, 43, a Flash developer, was killed in 2009 after being hit by a van near their Seattle home

Tragic accident: After Mr Hernando's medical support was withdrawn at the hospital, Ms Reynold's explained that her grief was worsened by her immediate panic about what she needed to do next as a single mother

Chanel Reynolds advises on her website: 'Here’s something you can do this evening over a glass of wine.

'Take 
one hour to jot down all of the passwords, numbers and other bits of 
information that you take for granted every day, but without which daily
 life would come grinding to a halt.

'This document will save you time at least a few times a year when you
 can easily dig up a pin or account number.

'Worst case scenario, you’ll 
save your family hours of misery and stress spent calling around trying 
to clean up your piles of unsorted paperwork.

'Take it from me. It is 
nothing short of punishing to call credit companies and government 
offices saying over and over again, “My husband died and I am trying to 
locate/get access to xxxx.'

Twenty minutes later her husband collided with a van and which 'decimated his upper spine and caused an immediate traumatic cardiac arrest. Technically, he died on the scene.'

After medical support was withdrawn at the hospital, Ms Reynolds explains that her grief was worsened by her immediate panic about what she needed to do next as a single mother.

'All of that extra stress and pain could have easily been avoided with a few hours of organization and follow through. I don’t want anyone to suffer the same way,' she explains.

Ms Reynolds was only just saved from financial ruin due to life insurance which kept her from having to go right back to work as a freelance project manager and sell the house they had only bought the previous year, at a massive loss.

But she grew tired of explain to 
companies that her husband had died and she needed access to the account
 because she did not know any of his passwords.

This experience inspired her to create her website which already has 500,000 page views and the spreadsheet lists detailing what to write down have been downloaded 85,000 times.

Idea: Get Your S*** Together was the brainchild of Chanel Reynolds, 42, who felt after her husband was killed in an accident, the grieving process was made more traumatic by financial worries

The site offers some basic financial 
advice, gives away free templates for a master checklist and provides 
starter forms to draft a will, living will and power of attorney.

There’s also a guide to starting a 
list of all of the accounts in your life that someone might need to 
access and shut down in your absence.

She believes the website is unique because it puts both life planning and death planning in the same place.  

As well as practical advice Ms Reynold's also offers personal advice - she says parents need to think about who would look after their children.

If she says a user finds themselves at a loss to know who should care for their children or to who they would like to make the decision to withdraw care then perhaps they may need to reconsider their friends.
