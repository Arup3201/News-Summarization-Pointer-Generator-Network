For regular smartphone users, trying to use your handset to zoom on screen while holding a cup of coffee or your shopping can be something of a juggling act. 

However, one US user of Google's maps software has discovered a secret gesture built into the firm's software than makes life easier.

It allows users to 'zoom' on the map simply by double clicking on the screen then leaving their finger on screen.

The newly-discovered 'one hand zoom' feature on Google's Maps app lets users easily zoom in with one hand while out and about by simply double tapping and holding their finger on the screen

'A friend and I just discovered a simple yet incredibly useful feature in Google Maps for iPhone… The one-hand zoom,' said Carl Sednaoui, who blogged about the find.

'To perform a one-hand zoom simply double tap on your map and, after the second tap, leave your finger pressed.

'You can then move your finger up and down to zoom in/ zoom out.'

The tip soon wen viral, and was described by Sednaoui as 'Simple, useful, elegant, brilliant.'

He also called for other mobile phone firms to implement the feature.

'Dear Apple, I’d love to see you implement this in Apple Maps.

'Dear developers, I’d love to see you implement this in any pinch-to-zoom app.'

Google's map app is available on both android (shown here) and Apple's iOS - and the new one hand zoom technique works on both.

Google yesterday announced the 
introduction of Treasure Mode following the discovery of the long lost 
maps of pirate Willian 'Captain' Kidd during an underwater exhibition.

They're
only kidding about the discovery, of course - it's one of a string of 
hoax new products and services the online ads giant revealed for April 
Fool's Day.

But the new 
Treasure Mode is such fun that observers are nonetheless hoping that it 
will actually last beyond the annual day of tricks and tomfoolery.

Me hearties! Google today announced the introduction of Treasure Mode following the discovery of the long lost maps of pirate Willian 'Captain' Kidd during an underwater exhibition

tech-related April Fool's japes, with its Treasure Mode joining Gmail 
Blue, Google Nose and the announcement that YouTube has in fact been an 
eight-year competition to find the best video.
