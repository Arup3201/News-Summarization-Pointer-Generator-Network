It’s a year out of your life that’s supposed to provide the chance to experience new cultures, learn the rigors of travel and expand your mind and horizons.

More often than not though, gap year returnees pick up crippling debt, tropical diseases, questionable hairstyles and STIs.

Now new research commissioned by student shipping specialists 1StopShip reveals what we’ve long suspected – that gap years and travelling is not always the ‘enriching’ experience we hope for.

Worth leaving home for? 62 per cent of people questioned admitted travelling didn't enrich them as a person

1,000 backpackers across the UK were questioned on their attitudes to travelling in hindsight.

The study  coincides with the start of the university term where thousands return from a year abroad – or defer studying in favour of a gap year.

More than 60 per cent of people admitted it didn't enrich them as a person, while 28 per cent who originally thought they had changed for the better, revised that opinion after returning to the UK and realising they were exactly the same.

Tell someone who cares: 29 per cent admitted to growing sick of their backpacking friends’ stories

A lonely road: 34 per cent admitted they struggled to get back into a work routine after being overseas

Nearly 30 per cent admitted to growing sick of their backpacking friends’ stories - and 12 per cent claimed that their friends returned with a false sense of superiority.

The general consensus was that travelling can harm your employment prospects and actually lose you friends.

19 per cent said that their current boss viewed their time travelling negatively and more than a third (34 per cent) admitted they struggled to make the transition to work after returning from time abroad.

Not all bad: 39 per cent of backpackers saw traveling as something that reflected well on their CV

Some 14 per cent claimed their stint overseas left them dreading work and feeling unprepared and the same number had trouble getting a job because they lacked experience compared to their non-travelling fellow candidates of a similar age.

Despite this, a 39 per cent of backpackers saw traveling as a positive and something that reflected well on their CV.

Ian Brown, from 1StopShip, said, ‘While the research may seem a little damning when it comes to taking a gap year, we know from our customers – a good proportion of whom are young people, recent school leavers or graduates – that there can be huge benefits too. 

'We would advise anyone looking to genuinely enrich themselves, or make a positive impression on prospective employers to consider incorporating both work and travel, such as teaching or temping overseas; this can ensure you acquire new skills, whilst also experiencing a new culture and seeing new places.’
