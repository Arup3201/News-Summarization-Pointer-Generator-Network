A teenager who pinned a 'lovable' father of two to the floor then punched him repeatedly has been spared jailed for his brutal attack - even though his victim had a fatal heart attack ten minutes later.

Shane Lethbridge, 19, had a grudge against Colin Palmer, 57, and beat him on the street in Biscovey, Cornwall.

He was found guilty of assault at Bodmin Magistrates' Court in Cornwall - but the trial heard that he was not to blame for the death as Mr Palmer already had heart disease.

However, experts said the 'sustained' and 'violent' attack couldn't be 'discounted' as a potential factor which contributed to the death.

The court heard how, after the attack, Mr Palmer got to his feet and staggered to a stranger’s door 'red-faced and breathless', begging for help.

He collapsed on the pavement moments later and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead having suffered a heart attack.

Bodmin Magistrates Court heard Lethbridge’s “sustained, violent and totally unjust” attack had likely “played a role” in Mr Palmer’s death.

But the court was told that his victim was suffering from heart disease and diabetes and could have suffered a heart attack at any moment.

Lethbridge, an engineering contractor, denied assault by beating but was found guilty by District Judge Nicholas Sanders after a two-day summary trial.

He sentenced him to six months in a Young Offenders’ Institution, suspended for 18 months.

Judge Sanders told him: 'My sympathy goes out to Mr Palmer’s friends and family - but this is not a trial for murder but for a common assault which was carried out about ten minutes before.

'It is clear to me that Mr Lethbridge did have a grudge against Mr Palmer but I can’t exclude the possibility that Mr Palmer played some role in how the incident started. This was a sustained, violent and totally unjust attack in Mr Palmer.

'He was vulnerable because of his age and illness and evidence suggests your actions played a role in his death from heart problems.

'It is clear you used considerable force and intended more harm on him than you caused at the time.'

The trial heard Lethbridge had 'a long-standing grudge' against Mr Palmer, a loading vehicle driver. who had been a family friend until the teen’s parents divorced.

Prosecutor Anthony Eskander said Lethbridge punched Mr Palmer several times to the head and body before throwing him to the ground when they bumped into one another in the street on August 18 last year.

Lethbridge’s friend, Ashley Curtis, said he helped Mr Palmer to his feet and he walked off.

Mr Curtis told the court: 'It wasn’t a fight - it was a girly scrap. Shane was on top and the old boy was kicking Shane.”

However, another teenage witness told the court: 'Shane was on top and started shouting at Mr Palmer. He was speaking to him as if he had done something wrong.

'He had aggression in his voice. A lot of punches were thrown, you could hear the thumps when he hit him. I only saw Mr Palmer trying to defend himself.'

Ten minutes after the attack in Biscovey, Cornwall, Jonathen L’Anson answered his door to Mr Palmer, who collapsed shortly afterwards and was later pronounced dead.

Lethbridge was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but he told police he only hit the older man once in self-defence after he was kicked.

A custody suite nurse found just a red mark on his upper body and a graze to his elbow, while Mr Palmer had abrasions, bruises and a fractured skull.

However Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said the wounds could have been caused by him collapsing to the floor or by vigorous attempts to resuscitate him.

He concluded that Mr Palmer was killed by a heart attack and could have died at any time, but said the stress of being assault 'couldn’t be discounted as a possible contributory factor'.

Judge Sanders said he took into account Lethbridge’s previous good character and age in deciding to suspend his prison term.

Lethbridge, from St Blazey Gate, Cornwall, was also ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid community work, handed a six-month curfew and was ordered told to pay £620 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Mr Palmer’s family issued a statement afterwards, saying: 'Colin was a cuddly, loveable guy who everybody said had a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face.

'He managed to go out every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend, for 20 years and never got into a fight, which shows the sort of character he was.

'We are pleased that the truth is finally out there; that Colin was a kind and loveable man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

'We have been robbed of a father, a son, a brother and a friend, and he will never ever be forgotten.'
