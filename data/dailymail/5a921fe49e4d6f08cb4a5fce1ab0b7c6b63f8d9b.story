It's the kind of Christmas tradition that could only exist in Australia.

The local fire brigade at Coledale, north of Wollongong in New South Wales, has staged its annual water fight against the local Surf Club and residents.

The Northern Hemisphere may be gearing up to celebrate the festive season with snow and cold weather, but Down Under Australians are enjoying the summer sunshine.

Beachgoers in the seaside town, north of Wollongong in New South Wales, threw waterbombs at firies

Fire trucks drove along with their sirens blaring as the firefighters sprayed locals with the fire hose

Hilarious footage shows a fire truck driving along with its sirens blaring as the firefighters spray locals with the fire hose and yell out 'Merry Christmas everyone' through a megaphone.

Beachgoers and campers throw water bombs at the firefighters who are dressed in full uniform standing on the roof of the truck.

Adults and children on the side of the road, some standing on the back of a ute, try in vain to fight back at the firies but end up getting saturated by the hose.

The fire truck is decorated with tinsel and a mini Santa Claus.

Locals said the water fight lasted about two hours.

NSW Rural Fore Service spokesman Matt Sun said many local brigades around the state have their own Christmas traditions.

'Some dress up as Santa, others have water balloon fights, it's just a bit of community spirit at a time when most of the community is available,' Mr Sun said.

Mr Sun added that the bushfire season had not been as intense as it was last year, but said firefighters were still working hard.

Between July 1 and Christmas Eve this year the NSW Rural Fire Service has attended 4637 bush and grass fires.

'We're not seeing a major fire incident like we saw last October but there's still plenty of activity around,' he said.

'We've had a number of hot days over the last few months and multiple total fire bans.'
