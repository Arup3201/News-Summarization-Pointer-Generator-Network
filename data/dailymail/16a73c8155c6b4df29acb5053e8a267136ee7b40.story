Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City’s season will not have been ‘a disaster’ even the Premier League champions fail to overhaul Chelsea in the title race.

The City boss is under fire after seeing his team crash out of Europe to Barcelona for the second season in a row on Wednesday night.

They must beat West Bromwich Albion at the Etihad this lunchtime (sat) to keep the pressure on Jose Mourinho’s side, who are six points clear with a game in hand, and stay clear of the chasing pack.

But Pellegrini said: ‘Second position in the whole year I don’t think is a disaster. We are not in eighth, ninth or 10th. Only Chelsea has done better than our team.

‘As I said to the players, we are still in this competition. We have nine games left and me must try to play well and do what we must for this team, which is to stay in second positon. 

'And – I repeat – never give up, because in football anything can happen, so we will fight to retain the title to the end.’

City’s players were criticised for their lack of effort in last weekend’s defeat at Burnley but Pellegrini insisted that the buck stops with him.

He added: ‘It will be my responsibility because I always choose the starting XI, I choose the squad and I choose the way we like to play.’

Asked if he still enjoyed the job, he replied: ‘Of course. Every day I enjoy it. If you cannot enjoy playing in the Champions League against Barcelona, fighting for title in the Premier League, being with this team, being in best league in world, you should go and see a doctor.’
