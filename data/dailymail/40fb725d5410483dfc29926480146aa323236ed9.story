The BBC website led yesterday afternoon with a claim from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable that by publishing the material the Guardian had done a 'considerable public service'

The BBC was accused last night of siding with the Guardian in its coverage of criticism of the newspaper’s release of top-secret documents.

The corporation’s website led yesterday afternoon with a claim from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable that by publishing the material the Guardian had done a ‘considerable public service’.

The headline echoed wording used on the newspaper’s live blog. That read: ‘NSA files – Guardian has done “considerable public service”, says Vince Cable.’

The BBC story also initially buried former Home Secretary Jack Straw’s damaging attack on the Guardian over the secret documents.

Mr Straw had made the comments to a BBC outlet and they appeared to have emerged after Mr Cable had spoken on the flagship BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday at 8.10am.

The Labour grandee’s powerful intervention was not mentioned at all on last night’s Six O’Clock News.

Their story instead led on David Cameron being ‘ready to listen’ on the issue of improving political oversight of security services, while ruling out a review. 

On Thursday, the Today programme failed to ask Home Secretary Theresa May about the Guardian row when she was interviewed in the same slot. Later in the day she was asked about it in separate BBC interviews and said the revelations had given ‘some comfort to terrorists’.

Robert Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, said: ‘It’s incredibly sad that our national broadcaster has seemingly chosen to side with the Guardian and impose a news blackout on an alleged major threat to our national security by a national newspaper.’

All week commentators have lambasted the BBC for its failure to give the story due prominence.

On Tuesday, when the story broke, the main news at 10pm led with MI5 director general Andrew Parker’s speech but made no mention of the key claim that the left-wing newspaper’s publication of GCHQ secrets had done ‘enormous damage’.

This prompted MPs to claim BBC journalists were ‘protecting their Left-wing friends’.

The following morning, bulletins on BBC Radio 4 failed to mention the newspaper at all although it was mention in later reports.

The BBC did not change its online coverage of the story on Wednesday to reflect criticism of the Guardian until the newspaper’s editor, Alan Rusbridger, publicly defended its actions.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We completely reject any suggestion that our reporting has been biased.

‘From the outset we have given this story a high profile and robustly questioned all the protagonists involved, representing a range of views as they have emerged including the new angles today, which were the comments from Vince Cable and Jack Straw.’
