A vintage dating guide reveals exactly what first dates were like for the single women of the 1950s - and it seems that restaurants were a landmine.

The unearthed guide from the October 1950 issue of Woman's Own sheds light on dating hurdles of the era.

The guide, ‘How to Behave in a Restaurant’, contains plenty of tips for young women, including this one:
 ‘The man always does the ordering, never ask the waiter yourself for 
anything.'

The magazine warned certain foods, such as celery, could ‘quite correctly be eaten with the hands’. However apples and pears should be approached with caution, because ‘fruit causes some embarrassment.’

'The rules of correct procedure vary,' the magazine warned. ''There are certain foods which are eaten in a manner entirely different from others. For instance, asparagus is one of the few foods which can be eaten with fingers.

'On the Continent, fruit is always eaten with a knife and fork but in this country it is sometimes correct to cut the apple or pear into sections and eat it with your fingers or just the fork.

'Cherries should be put into the mouth whole and the stones carefully placed on a spoon.'

Step-by-step guide: The article even has imagery showing a woman exactly how to behave in a restaurant, advising her how to eat fruit and to never drop cutlery on the floor

Rules: The article warns: 'Watch your table manners, people are so apt to decide what kind of person you are by watching you eat, it's easy to make mistakes'

And it wasn’t just dessert which could cause a problem, the magazine steered women away from fish because it could be ‘difficult to manage’ and when the meal was over, they were reminded it was ‘bad taste’ to leave lipstick marks on a cup.

Further advice suggests: 'tipping your soup bowl away from you' because lifting it towards you was the ‘height of bad manners’.

The guide also adds: 'It is bad manners to put your elbows on
 the table. It is also very bad manners to powder your nose or put on 
lipstick at the table, and unforgivable to comb your hair at the meal.'

Dropped your knife on the floor? Heed Woman's Own's advice: 'you do not start frantically hunting to retrieve it, ask the waiter to bring you a clean one.'

Although the type of Woman’s Own content has moved on since the 'How to Behave in a Restaurant' days, the weekly magazine say its mantra has remained the same since the 1930's.

Terry Tavner, Editor in Large of Woman's Own, said: 'Since 1932, Woman's Own has been entertaining and educating women of every generation.

'The magazine is less about age and more about life stages, which is why we attract readers in their 30s through to their 70s.

'Woman's Own is a rite of passage, handed down from generation to generation and we are honoured to continue that tradition in the 21st century.'

A spokesperson for CupidSpeedDater.com, who uncovered the piece, said: 'Thankfully 
times have changed and the dating game is more relaxed. While dating can
 still be daunting at least women no longer have to worry if they drop a
 knife on the floor during a meal.'
