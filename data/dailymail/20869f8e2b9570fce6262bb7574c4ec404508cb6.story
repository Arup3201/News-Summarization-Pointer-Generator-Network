Richard Dawe, 80, breached a restraining order banning him from being anti-social (file picture)

An ASBO pensioner who has terrorised his neighbours living in a rural village for the past 16 years has been jailed for breaching the order for the 25th time. 

Richard Dawe, 80, breached a restraining order banning him from being anti-social when he launched a verbal attack on Barbara Wilks, 57, who lives next door to him.

The sheep farmer has a string of ASBOs - including one for singing ‘Oh What A Beautiful Morning’ and Tom Jones’ classic ‘Delilah’ - at the top of his voice outside his neighbour’s houses.

Dawe was jailed previously in 2012 after he threw mud at windows as well as calling Mrs Wilks 'ugly' during the ongoing feud.

He also swore at his neighbours, attacked one with a shovel and made peacock noises to annoy a woman who he claimed played her radio too loudly.

His bizarre hate campaign against his long-suffering neighbours in the pretty village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire, dates back to 1998.

The serial pest described another’s home as a ‘tart’s boudoir’ and once goose-stepped up an anthill shouting ‘the Don rules’, has repeatedly breached the terms of his order since it was imposed.

He was finally jailed for six months in July 2012 after he was caught on CCTV lobbing clumps of mud and stone at his neighbour’s garage window which smashed.

However, last week he was back on trial again at Worcester Crown Court accused of breaching an ASBO - which was imposed on October 5, 2004. 

The court heard the breach occurred when Dawe shouted 'a load of bloody c***s' at Mrs Wilks following a long-standing row over land on January 14.

On Monday the OAP - described as having a criminal record the 'length of War and Peace' - was jailed again after he admitted breaching the 10-year ASBO.

Sentencing Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'The language was particularly vile.

'He was trying to discuss some kind of deal over the land and it was in that context he used the language he admitted to using.

'The order was designed to stop him using language of this kind.

'You have offended in this context of breaching criminal orders since 1998.

'I cannot tell you how much I hope that I never see you in this court again.'

The five day trial heard the OAP used the offensive language at around 6pm on January 14.

The court was told he 'delighted' in terrorising residents by referring himself as the 'Don of Castlemorton', 'The Godfather' and referring to himself as 'Mad Max'.

Prosecuting Roger Brown said: 'Every time she goes out Barbara Wilkes takes a dictaphone to record him. 

'This has happened frequently.

'She (Barbara Wilkes) is very upset. The language was very unpleasant.'

He was also accused of driving onto Mrs Wilkes’ land before chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car, but a jury cleared him of this charge.

Dawe admitted driving at the sheep on March 18 but said he did so slowly to shepherd them away. 

He also claimed his two dogs were in his car at all times and said he only let them out of the vehicle once the sheep were out of the field and the gate was closed.

The court heard the ASBO was handed to Dawe at Birmingham Crown Court on October 5, 2004 and was due to expire on October 4 this year. 

Dawe, who has numerous previous convictions including wounding and harassment, was also cleared of charges of criminal damage and breaching an ASBO by damage to property.

Defending Lee Masters said: 'He is 80 years old and he has been in custody for 171 days in total, an awful long time.

'Quite frankly, he is his own worst enemy. 

'If he returns home today, you may think he may not be able to resist saying, for instance, "Mrs Wilkes, your lies were not believed by the jury". 

'However, he instructed me all he wants to do is go home to his wife.'

Dawe - who will be free in a month - has previously dismissed the ongoing feud in the idyllic village and branded it as petty parish politics.

Speaking four years ago he said: 'I’ve been a valuable member of the community all my life. 

'But the neighbours have ganged up on me because they want that corner of the street to themselves. 

'I’ve been victimised by them.

'I like to sing and I just let out whatever tunes come into my head. It’s all just petty parish politics.'
