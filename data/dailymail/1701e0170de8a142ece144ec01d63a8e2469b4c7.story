In court: Geoffrey Butler, 54, is accused of racially harassing a German man and his wife

A teacher put his German neighbour through four years of ‘hell’ by blaring out the Dambusters theme, Vera Lynn singing White Cliffs of Dover and Rule Britannia, a court heard.

Geoffrey Butler, 54, is accused of  racially harassing the man and his wife by playing wartime classics, including  the Colonel Bogey March from the film Bridge On the River Kwai, doing a Nazi salute and broadcasting a Winston Churchill speech.

He is also accused of whistling patriotic tunes, staring at his neighbours and making unfounded complaints about them.

Butler, a maths teacher for 28 years, denies the four-year hate campaign. Medway magistrates in Kent heard that Reinhard Wendt, 62, and his wife Kathryn moved next door to Butler in the village of Lower Upnor in 2007.

At first the neighbours got on well, but before long they fell out over a tiny piece of land no more than six feet long which was to be transferred to the Wendts.

Mr Butler accused the Wendts of being dishonest and complained the failed deal cost him £256 in solicitors’ fees. The row quickly escalated, the court heard.

Butler, whose family  members served in the RAF including one in the 617  ‘Dambusters’ squadron, was questioned on suspicion of assault after an incident between him and Mr Wendt  in July 2007, but no charges were brought.

Butler was arrested last May and charged with racially-aggravated harassment.

The court heard he told police: ‘I haven’t been doing this. It may happen on the odd occasion, whatever. I don’t see anything wrong with Dame Vera Lynn. I come from an RAF family.’

But Mr Wendt, who moved to Britain from Germany in 1999, accused Butler of whistling the war tunes and playing them from his car stereo regularly since 2007.

He also claimed Butler would pretend to be on his phone next to the garden fence and talk loudly about Nazis.

He told magistrates he had nightmares and said: ‘It was like waterboarding, after a while a little whistle was enough. It let me know he was there and watching me.’

Social worker Mrs Wendt, who broke down in tears  giving evidence, said: ‘It made me feel nervous and intimidated and I didn’t want to  go out into my back garden.

'I just want to live a peaceful life. I haven’t looked for this trouble.’

The court was told that Butler would stand on his garage roof and his ladder to stare at the Wendts, but Butler said he was sunbathing.

Events came to a head last April when the Wendts claimed they were sitting in bed and saw Butler taking a picture of them through the window, which Butler denied.

That afternoon Mr Wendt made a recording on his  phone, apparently of Butler playing one of Churchill’s  war speeches.

Five days later the Wendts claimed they saw Butler in his kitchen making a Nazi salute, mimicking a Hitler moustache with his fingers and shouting.

Butler told police Mr Wendt was the one giving him the salute, adding: ‘Why would I do that? I find it grossly offensive.’

If found guilty he could face up to two years’ jail.

The case was adjourned.
