A primary school teacher kissed a 15-year-old girl in a classroom cupboard and engaged in sex acts with her and another teenager in his car, a court heard.

Jonathan Norbury, 33, is accused of sexually touching two teenage girls as well 'inciting' the pair to perform sex acts on him. 

Swansea Crown Court was told he would sneak the 15-year-old, who can not be named for legal reasons, into his classroom after school and take her into the stationery cupboard where he asked to see her underwear.

Jonathan Norbury, pictured arriving at court with his wife, is accused of sexually touching two teenage girls as well 'inciting' the pair to perform sex acts on him 

As well as letting the secondary school student into the classroom through the fire exit, the girl claims she would creep out of her house in the middle of the night, where they would perform sex acts on one another.

The girl, who is now an adult, said: 'We would go into the cupboard, he would normally ask me to show him my underwear which I would.

'Then he would say something sexual, and then we would start kissing.'

The girl claims her sexual relationship with Norbury started not long after she turned 15 when he allegedly texted her to say she looked 'hot'. 

Recalling the message, she said: 'I was quite shocked to start with but also quite pleased....pleased because I thought he was good-looking and an older man.'

The woman said she had bought a second phone to keep in contact with Norbury, and would send Norbury photographs of herself in her underwear. 

During their secret meetings in his car, she said they would kiss and touch each other's genitals.

'After I turned 16, it seemed that he sort of lost interest,' she said.

The pair later kept in touch via phone, with a jury hearing that Norbury told his future wife about his relationship with her.

The witness said: 'I told him "I bet you didn't tell her how old I was". I then heard what sounded like crying. I never heard from him again.'

During cross-examination, defence QC Elwen Evans questioned the witness's account of the text message Norbury allegedly sent.

The court heard the woman had written about the alleged text on her personal organiser - and the note was dated.

But Miss Evans asked whether you could put any date in the organiser and 'backdate it'.

The witness agreed that this was possible to do.

Norbury admits having mutual sexual relations with both girls, but denies the charges against him, insisting that the relationships took place only when the girls were aged 16 or over 

After telling the jury she had used the organiser off and on for around a year, Miss Evans asked why there were only two entries on it.

'There were all sorts of things that you said Jonathan said and did after that ... none of which you have noted on your organiser,' Miss Evans said.

The QC also asked the witness: 'Did you want some form of revenge (on Norbury)?'

She replied: 'No. I have got no reason to.' 

Another alleged victim claims she was also in a relationship with Norbury when she was 15 - with the teacher taking her to beauty spots in his car, where they would have 'sexual contact'.

She alleges that she and Norbury, a devout Christian, continued their relationship until she was around 19, but she agreed to keep their trysts a secret as it might affect Norbury's respected position at a local church.

She says she lost her virginity to Norbury a few weeks after her 16th birthday, having met him in early 2005, but said they had engaged in sexual contact before then.

However, she told the court she could not remember exactly when the relationship had started, or when the sexual activity began. 

She also said Norbury contacted her in 2012 to apologise 'for everything that happened' ahead of him getting married. 

Earlier in the trial, she told the jury that her decision to break her silence was not motivated by jealousy.

During cross-examination, the woman was asked how she felt when their relationship ended.

She said: 'Did I accept the relationship was over? No. I would phone him and text him.

'Do I accept that I would text him 30 or 40 times a day? I could have done.

'Two years after the break-up was I still trying to get back with Jonathan? Yes.'

But the woman insisted it was the police who contacted her about Norbury after detectives began investigating allegations involving him and the other 15-year-old.

She said: 'My job is working with vulnerable children under the age of 16. The reason why I brought this up (to police) was if I thought one of my children were being sexually abused or groomed by an older man, then I would want something done about it. That's the reason why I brought this (up to police).

'I would have never have brought the case against him... it was the police who approached me.'

Norbury admits having mutual sexual relations with both girls, but denies the charges against him, insisting that the relationships took place only when the girls were aged 16 or over. Neither of the women were his pupils.   

Neither the church Norbury was a member of and the primary school he was working at the time of the alleged offences can be revealed for legal reasons.

A judge has also issued an order preventing the media from naming the address where Norbury currently resides. 

The case continues.
