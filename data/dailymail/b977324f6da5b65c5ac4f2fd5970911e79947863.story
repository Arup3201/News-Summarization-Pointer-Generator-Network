A Romanian man has been arrested after sneaking aboard a Wizz Air flight to Spain to visit his girlfriend.

Claudiu-Gabriel Costin's plan was foiled after security spotted the light from his phone flashing as he took selfies inside the cockpit.

The 30 year-old man arrived at Cluj international airport in north-western Romania, crept past security, got onto the runway and clambered into a stationary plane that was due to travel to Spain.

He uploaded the pictures onto Facebook for his girlfriend to see with a song called 'I'd like to get to you'

Under the cover of darkness no one immediately saw the stowaway as he boarded the plane. The incident is especially embarrassing for airport officials given that they were on heightened security alert after a dangerous criminal had escaped from a local prison.

According to Romanian Times, Costin hadn't been able to book a ticket, so decided to take matters into his own hands.

He said: 'I wanted to visit my girlfriend who lives in London but when I tried to book a ticket, they had all sold out.

'I haven't seen her for weeks now and I miss her very much so I decided that no matter what, I would go and see her.'

However Costin, who is listed on his Facebook page as a life coach, grew bored of waiting for the flight to take off so started taking photographs.

After entering the pilot's cockpit he took snaps of himself, the controls and the Wizz Air flight log book before posting them on Facebook where his girlfriend Aline Haskil, 27, would see them. He also posted a song by Romanian pop-rock band Bere Gratis called 'I'd like to get to you'.

Although claiming he wanted to visit his girlfriend in London, Costin had boarded a flight that was bound for Spain.

An airport spokesperson said: 'It was an evening flight and he was caught after security noticed his camera flash going off inside the cockpit.

Costin denies sneaking into cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who offered him sexual favours

'When they went to investigate they found the man inside. We are looking into the circumstances and how he managed to breach security, get onto the runway and climb abroad the plane without being noticed.

'There was clearly a lapse in security and this will be addressed and sorted out.'

Clearly caught in a tricky spot Costin denies sneaking into the cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who  then inexplicably offered him sexual favours.

He told local authorities: 'I was just wandering around when a pilot appeared and told me to get inside the cockpit and he'd do me a favour. 

I didn't understand what he meant but then he got his penis out. I was really shocked, and decided I was going to leave town and go and live in a hut in the mountains.'

The airport spokesperson said: 'This makes no sense and there was no sign of any pilot.'

It is, as yet, unclear what penalty Mr Costin will face. 

Wizz Air has said: 'Wizz Air confirms that Cluj Airport suffered a security breach unauthorized access to parked and sealed aircraft in the early morning hours 27 January.

An individual who is understood to have broken into the airport campus and into a closed aircraft, was subsequently arrested. While this is now a matter for the police, Wizz Air welcomes Cluj Airport's full revision of its security procedures. 

Passenger safety was ensured at all times as all Wizz Air aircraft are subject to thorough inspection before entering service.'
