Google has taken tourism to the next level by allowing people from around the world to see monuments like Stonehenge, the streets of Pompeii and the remote landscapes of Antarctica from the comfort of their own living room.

Now the company is allowing users to explore Mexico's ancient Mayan ruins through their digital devices after adding dozens of sites to Google Street View.

Google used a three wheeled trike to ride around Mayan monuments to capture 360 degree images for its Street View project. This is Chichen Itza, a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya civilization.

Users will be able to interact with a multitude of images from pre-Hispanic sites on the Street View feature that is incorporated into Google Maps.

Google Mexico and Mexico's National 
Institute of Anthropology and History announced yesterday  that 30 sites
have been added to Street View so far.

However, dozens more will be coming online this year and the target is to reach 90 sites. 

The world-famous sites already online include Chichen Itza, Uman - Hopelchen, Teotihuacan (the world's third largest pyramid) and Monte Alban.

Today, the Maya and their descendants form large populations throughout the Maya area where they maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs.

The heart of the Mayan civilization lies further south in Honduras, Guatemala, and western El Salvador, more than 1,000 km (620 mi) from Mexico.

Mayan ruins in Chetumal, the capital of Quintana Roo, and one of thirty key Mayan sites Google has added to its Street View project.

Street View allows users to click on map
locations to obtain 360-degree, interactive images composed of millions
of photos taken at street level by specially equipped vehicles.

Campaigners have warned that privacy risks being sacrificed in a commercial race between Google and its rival Apple, which unveiled its latest mapping technology yesterday.

The two are competing to produce three-dimensional maps and have deployed spy planes to photograph streets and homes.

The planes will be able to operate in British skies without special licensing or permits.

Google has also used its Street View cars to gather ground-level panoramic photographs.

Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with an estimated 1.2 million tourists visit the ruins every year. Google allows pictures taken by tourists to be overlaid onto the pictures from its trike

Name: Street View Trike

Inpiration: a rickshaw

Number of wheels: 3

Weight:18 stone

Cameras: capture and match images to a specific location

Google uses a special, three-wheeled bicycle to photograph some of the hardest to reach places on the planet.

The Street View trike, as it is known, has been sent around the world to reach remote places that cars can't get to.

They carry the same camera equipment usually found on Google's fleet of Vauxhall Astras which have been touring Britain taking shots for the service.

The bike allows Google to collect 360° horizontal and 
290° vertical panoramic street level views using special cameras.

They capture and match images to a specific location using GPS devices.

Once the images are captured, they are 'sewn' together to create a 360° panorama.

Users can search Street View by entering a specific address, or pulling the yellow 'Pegman' icon to the area they want to see.

One of the sites featured is Palenque; a former Mayan city in Southern Mexico that flourished in the 7th century

The Mayans lived between 2000BC to 250AD. This pale stone building is found in the ancient Mayan city of Uxmal
