The longest heatwave in seven years has claimed the lives of 13 people swimming in open waters.

The Met Office yesterday issued a level three heat health warning – one notch below the most serious – after 12 days of temperatures of 28C (82F).

The alert across London and the South East warns that the young, old and those with chronic diseases could be at risk.

Yesterday, temperatures soared to the 
highest this year, the Met Office said, reaching 32C (90F) in Northolt, 
north-west London.

For five days, the mercury has exceeded 30C (86F) – 
leading many to escape the heat by swimming.

So far 13 people have died in old 
quarries, lakes and rivers, including a man who dived into the Thames to
 save a 12-year-old girl.

Yesterday a 16-year-old boy and Ryan 
Pettengell, 41, drowned at a quarry near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, after 
becoming  tangled in reeds 6ft underwater. A friend of Mr Pettengell 
said he had a broken arm.

On Monday Daniel Clemo, 24, from 
Caerphilly, and a man of 52 were found dead in reservoirs in the Brecon 
Beacons, South Wales. Mr Clemo’s mother Tina said: ‘I just want 
people to look at this and to stay away from the water – it entices all 
ages but it’s no good.’

On Sunday Nathan Lane, 28,  
disappeared after diving into the Thames at Gravesend, Kent, to save a 
12-year-old girl who was later rescued by others. His body has not been 
found.

Last Friday John Shailes, 27, drowned 
on a late-night swim after drinking with friends in Swindon, Wilts. 
Damian Southall, 20, died in the Severn River in Shropshire.

On Friday, Justas Juzenas, 22, drowned at Gullet Quarry, Worcs., where 17-year-old Russell O’Neill died on Saturday July 6.

Schoolgirl Hollie McClymont, 14, 
drowned at Barry Island, South Wales, on Sunday July 7. The body of 
Matthew Joseph, 21, was pulled from Coniston Water in the Lake District 
on the same day.

The growing number of fatalities 
yesterday prompted a warning from the Royal Lifesaving Society.

Chief 
Executive Di Standley said: ‘The number of people who have lost their 
life is not only extremely sad but extremely worrying.

‘Do not be tempted to cool off in open water, unless it is a supervised area intended for swimming, or an organised event.’

Swimming is banned in the lakes, parts of which have unpredictable depths and dense undergrowth, but many ignore the signs and take to the waters regardless

David Walker, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ‘The water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater debris.

‘Consider how you will get out of the water before you get in.’

The heatwave could make July the 
driest on record. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘Wednesday 
was the 12th day that we have seen temperatures above 28C. The last time
 we saw this was seven years ago in July 2006.

‘The hot weather is set to continue until next week, when things start to look a bit more changeable and we may get some rain.’

Health officials have urged people to 
keep cool, drink water and keep an eye on people who may be at risk, 
such as pregnant women.
