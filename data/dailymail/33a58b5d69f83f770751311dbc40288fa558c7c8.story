A Browning machine gun found in a downed Spitfire has been fired for the first time in 70 years.

The weapon worked despite being buried in peat since the aeroplane that housed it plummeted to earth in Donegal in 1941.

A
 team from the BBC went to the site and dug the guns from where the 
Spitfire had crashed and could even smell aviation fuel in the air.

Six Browning machine guns were found in good nick thanks to the ideal clay, soil and peat condition

Despite being buried for the last 70 years, the Browning machine gun worked perfectly

There were six guns that presenter 
Dan Snow reported were in 'great shape, with belts containing hundreds 
of gleaming .303 rounds.'

They even found pilot Roland 'Bud' Wolfe's leather helmet among the wreckage.

The guns were cleaned and a couple of pieces were straightened out after suffering some damage on impact.

The
 soil, clay and peat had provided the perfect conditions for the 
artefacts to be preserved and, when fired, they worked like a treat.

Mr Snow continued: 'The gun fired 
without a hitch. There can be no greater testament to the machinists and
 engineers in UK factories in the 1940s who, despite churning out guns 
at the rate of thousands per month, made each one of such high quality 
that they could survive a plane crash and 70 years underground and still
 fire like the day they were made.'

Excavation work at the site on the moors above Donegal uncovered the wreckage of the Spitfire - much of it was still intact

Hundreds of bullets were found with the Browning machine gun

When Wolfe crashed his British 
Spitfire into a peat bog in Ireland during World War Two, few thought it
 would ever be seen again.

The pilot who bailed out immediately wanted to climb into the cockpit of another military aircraft and continue fighting for the allies.

Knowing
 that his fighter was doomed, the young RAF officer had radioed: 'I'm 
going over the side' before parachuting to safety moments before impact.

Historian Dan Snow led the project to dig the Spitfire out of the peat bog almost 70 years after the pilot bailed out of the doomed plane

But instead of fighting again the 
serviceman was interned in a camp - where captured UK and U.S. troops 
mixed freely with the German enemy.

Despite
 managing to escape from Ireland, neutral during the war, and making his
 way back to Britain, the 23-year-old was sent back to the camp.

Fearing
 a diplomatic row, the British Government returned Wolfe to the most 
relaxed of 'prison' camps in Ireland where he was kept for a further two
 years.

The pilot from 
Nebraska had been stripped of his U.S. citizenship after agreeing to 
fight for the British because the Americans had not yet joined the war.

Now
 almost 70 years after the pilot from the 133 'Eagle' Squadron 
crash-landed in the north of Ireland in November 1941, his crashed plane
 has been recovered.

The 
Spitfire was the first of 20 made with a donation from a Canadian 
millionaire called Willard Garfield Weston who wanted to support the 
Allies in the Battle of Britain with a £100,000 donation.

Remarkably large parts of the plane have been recovered from the bog.

Six
 machine guns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also discovered 
by archaeologists searching the Inishowen Peninsula in Co Donegal.

The excavation was carried out as part of a BBC Northern Ireland programme.

Historian
 Dan Snow said: 'The plane itself is obviously kind of wreckage and the 
big pieces survived. We're expecting to find things like the engine and 
there still may be personal effects in the cockpit.

'It's
 just incredible because it's just so wet here that the ground just 
sucked it up and the plane was able to burrow into it and it's been 
preserved.

'It's in amazing condition,' he told RTE radio.

Mr Snow said Mr Wolf was forced to 
abandon his Spitfire over the Republic when its engine overheated about 
13 miles from his base at RAF Eglinton, now Derry International Airport,
 in Northern Ireland.

Aviation archeologist Simon Parry 
told the Irish Independent that it was highly significant that the 
doomed plane had been recovered.

'The
 pilot was lucky to survive that day because if his engine had failed a 
few minutes earlier he would have ended up in the sea,' he said.

Landing on neutral soil, the 23-year-old pilot was interned at Curragh detention camp in Co Kildare for two years.

With
 fishing trips, fox hunts and football matches it sounded almost like a 
holiday camp - and seemingly the ideal place to be holed up as war raged
 across the rest of Europe.

The guards were only issued with blank rounds, visitors were permitted and there were frequent excursions to nearby pubs.

Around 40 RAF pilots who crashed in Ireland were held in the corrugated iron huts alongside the German enemy.

The crew of destroyed U-boats and Luftwaffe planes also ended up at the camp.

The
 warring nations even played football matches against each other - with 
the Germans defeating the largely English team 8-3, in a precursor to 
their repeated post-war footballing triumphs over their North Atlantic 
enemy.

But although servicemen were free to come and go from the camp Wolfe, who died in 1994, was determined to fight on.

In December 1941, just two weeks 
after his crash, the serviceman made his way into Dublin before hopping 
onto a train to Belfast which was British territory.

As his doomed plane came down he parachuted out before watching it plunge into the ground half a mile away.

Although
 he made his way back to RAF Eglinton, he was returned to the Irish camp
 where he spent a further two years before it was closed.

Belatedly
 he got his wish, and in 1943 he was allowed to return to frontline 
action as the tide of the war turned in the Allies direction.

It is only because of the unusually soft ground that the crashed Spitfire could be recovered in the 70th year after the crash.

The
 Irish Defence Forces said the six Browning .303 machine guns and 
approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered by a team of 
archaeologists from Queens University buried up to 30 feet in the bog.

'The
 six machine guns and ammunition have been removed by the bomb disposal 
team to a secure military location where they will be decommissioned and
 cleaned before being handed over to the Derry Museum,' a spokesman 
added.

The plane will now be preserved and go on display at the Tower Museum in Derry.
