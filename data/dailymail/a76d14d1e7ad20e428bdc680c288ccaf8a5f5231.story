Major film studios battling online piracy launched a test case action at the High Court yesterday against Britain's biggest internet service provider.

They are urging a judge in London to grant an order which would force BT to cut off customers' access to a website accused of 'flagrant' copyright infringement.

Hollywood studios - including Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Disney - have brought the proceedings over the Newzbin website, which has around 700,000 members.

'Social evil': Major film studios battling online piracy have launched a test case action at the High Court against BT, Britain's biggest internet service provider

Richard Spearman QC, arguing for an 
injunction on behalf of the applicants, told Mr Justice Arnold at the 
start of an estimated three-day hearing that the Newzbin copyright 
infringement was being carried out on a 'grand scale'.

The general economic impact of piracy on the film and TV industry was, he said, 'nothing short of staggering'.

Describing
the illegal activity as a 'social evil', Mr Spearman said the loss to 
the industry was estimated to be 'several hundred millions of pounds'.

A
report published last year estimated overall loss to the film industry 
to be £477million in 2009 and £58million to the TV industry.

The High Court action, which is being
brought on behalf of all members of the Motion Picture Association of 
America, is believed to be the first in Britain where an attempt is 
being made to force an internet provider to block a site under the 1988 
Copyright, Design and Patents Act (CDPA).

Filmmakers want BT to block Newzbin with the same system that stops access to sites hosting child sex abuse images.

Mr Spearman said the order sought was a simple one for BT to implement and 'costs nothing'.

The
QC told the judge: 'The applicants and others have been making huge 
efforts, not only against the Newzbin website, but against piracy in 
general and yet the industries are still suffering huge losses to 
piracy.

'If the order is 
not made, websites such as Newzbin will simply be able to move offshore,
anonymise the individuals behind the website and cock a snook at the 
courts and at rights holders who put their trust in the courts.'

Studios - including Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Disney - have brought the proceedings over the Newzbin website, which has 700,000 members

BT is contesting the claim for an injunction, arguing that there is no jurisdiction for the court to make the order sought against it under the CDPA.

Mr Spearman said the background to the dispute was a successful High Court action last year against Newzbin.

As a result of orders made by a judge in those proceedings the Newzbin website was taken offline and the company that operated it was put into liquidation 'avoiding the payment of the costs order and any damages'.

But the website was only offline for a 'very short while' and was now back up and running and continued to focus on providing movies and TV.

The QC told the judge that apart from the addition of the digit '2' to the name to make it Newzbin2 'the only difference appears to be that the operation has been moved offshore'.

The upshot was that, despite 'considerable effort and expense' in bringing a successful action against the website operators, those behind it 'continue flagrantly to infringe the applicants' copyrights'.

The 'very large' number of subscribers to the Newzbin website 'continue to infringe the applicants' copyrights by downloading copies of many commercially important motion pictures and television programmes'.

Mr Spearman told the judge: 'The applicants have no realistic means of bringing this wide-scale infringement to an end by pursuing the operators of the website or its subscribers.'

In written argument before the court, submitting that the injunction application should be dismissed, Antony White QC, for BT, argued that if the court ordered it to block access to the newzbin2 website 'there would be nothing to stop countless other claimants coming forward demanding that BT block other websites alleged to contain unlawful material'.

Rights holders in the music and movie industries 'have already identified 100 copyright infringing websites which they would like to see blocked'.

BT had heard 'verbal indications from rights holders' representatives to the effect that they would like to see 400 sites a year blocked by ISPs'.

Mr White added: 'Nor would this flood of claims be restricted to copyright infringement.

'Claimants would seek orders blocking access to websites alleged to contain defamatory allegations or private and confidential information.'

The case continues.
