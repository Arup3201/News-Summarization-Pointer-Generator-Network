He was freed from prison on compassionate grounds because he supposedly only had months to live.

Now - two and a half years on - the Lockerbie bomber will protest his innocence in 'deathbed memoirs' to be published next week.

To avoid a public backlash, profits 
from sales will be handed to charities – with the convicted terrorist 
himself receiving none of the cash.

Deathbed: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi has terminal cancer

However, it has emerged that one of the 
first beneficiaries is likely to be a group which has publicly backed 
Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi’s fight to clear his name.

The move will raise fears that the Libyan will indirectly profit from a boost to the campaign to prove his innocence.

The book could also heap fresh embarrassment on the Scottish Government and Labour, whose ministers repeatedly claimed 
the decision to free Megrahi, incensing Lockerbie victims' families, was
 taken solely by the Scottish Executive on 'compassionate grounds'.

But documents have since come to 
light showing that Labour secretly helped free Megrahi to appease 
Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and 
unleash 'holy war' on Britain.

Megrahi was controversially released from a life sentence in August 2009 because of his terminal illness. He was believed to have only months to live.

The former Libyan intelligence officer 
is the only person convicted of the December 21, 1988 atrocity. The 
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland killed 270 people.

Upon his release, he returned to Libya, where he was hailed as a hero.

He was last seen in December, 
apparently
 with just days to live, when he gave an interview from his death bed. 
Speaking from his family home in Tripoli, he protested his 
innocence and asked to be left alone to die from the ravages caused by 
prostate cancer.

He said he had little knowledge of 
the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and claimed Libyan 
opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him.

Relatives of those killed in the December 1988 atrocity claimed any profits should go instead to those affected by the attack.

Frank Duggan, president of Victims of 
Pan Am 103 – which represents the  families of the Americans who died – 
said: ‘Why not give this money to the people of Lockerbie, or give it to
 the people who helped the victims’ relatives?

‘At the very least it would have been less contentious to give it to charities which haven’t actively supported him.’

However, he added: ‘Victims’ relatives in the U.S. wouldn’t accept five cents from him and they know the whole book is really nothing more than a fraud.’

Megrahi, who will turn 60 on April 1, 
has worked on the book with English author John Ashton since his release
 from Greenock Prison in Renfrewshire.

Edinburgh-based
 publisher Birlinn is to unveil Megrahi –  You Are My Jury: The 
Lockerbie Evidence on Tuesday next week and is planning to donate all 
the profits to charity.

The 
Mail has learned one of first recipients of the cash will be the 
Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (MOJO), which has publicly 
supported Megrahi and believes he is innocent.

Its project co-ordinator, John McManus, has said Megrahi should never have been convicted, calling him a ‘political pawn.’

A
 MOJO spokesman said ‘in principle’ the Glasgow-based charity would be 
happy to accept the cash and the decision was likely to be ratified at a
 meeting tomorrow.

But last 
night Scottish Tory justice spokesman David McLetchie said: ‘The 
publication of a book written by Megrahi, the UK’s worst mass murderer, 
will only cause further heartache for the families of his victims.

‘It’s
 a bitter reminder that a man given a short time to live and let out of 
jail by the SNP is now authoring a book two-and-a-half years later, 
which further demonstrates the folly of this decision.’

The 496-page paperback, priced at 
£14.99, promises to present ‘conclusive new evidence’ to prove Megrahi 
was ‘an innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and 
judicial folly’.

In it, 
Megrahi will claim to reveal ‘how I came to be blamed for Britain’s 
worst mass murder, my nightmare decade in prison and the truth about my 
controversial release’.

A BBC Scotland documentary to accompany the publication of the book will also be aired next Monday.

Last night, a Birlinn spokesman insisted ‘no money will ever go to Megrahi’.

Managing director Hugh Andrew added: ‘I absolutely defend our right to publish this book. It is not a statement on his innocence or guilt but he has the right to have his case in the public domain. A great deal more information has come to light since the trial.’

Author Mr Ashton, who has invested much of his own money in the project, said: ‘On the advice of his lawyers, Abdelbaset opted not to give evidence at trial – a decision he regretted. The book presents the account that he would have given at trial and leaves it to the readers to judge.’

A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We do not doubt the safety of the conviction of Al Megrahi, who was found guilty of an act of state-sponsored terrorism and did not act alone.’
