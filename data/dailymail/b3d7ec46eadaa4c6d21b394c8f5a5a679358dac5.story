Bayern Munich goalkeeper Pepe Reina has been ruled out 'for a number of weeks' after sustaining a calf injury, the club has confirmed.

Reina - who joined the Bundesliga champions in August on a three-year deal - injured himself while playing for the club in a friendly against an amateur set of fans on Monday night.

The 32-year-old - who is challenging Manuel Neuer for the No 1 shirt at the club - now faces a spell on the sidelines with former second-choice keeper Tom Starke filling Reina's void while he recovers.

A Bayern XI ran out 5-1 winners against the Paulaner Dream Team with Xabi Alonso netting his first goal for the club in the low-key contest.

The experienced midfielder scored a peacher of a goal fit to win any game, as he chested the ball down just outside the area before firing an impressive half-volley into the corner of the net.

The Bundesliga giants will be hoping for more of the same from the ex-Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder in the future as they look to replicate their league and cup double success from last season and eye their second Champions League crown in three years.
