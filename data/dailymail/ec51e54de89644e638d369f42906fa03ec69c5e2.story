Relatives found the young boy, whose clothes were soaking wet, but were unable to find Rushona because of the green algae covering the surface of the lake.

A major rescue operation was launched, with the NYPD deploying their specialist sub aqua unit as well as a helicopter which hovered low over the lake in a bid to blow away some of the algae.

Tragically, divers found Rushona's body at 6.06pm on Saturday and carefully brought it to the shore, covered in a grey blanket.

Rushona's family were celebrating the July 4 holiday weekend and were grilling kabobs in the park overlooking the lake when she went missing.

The medical examiner's office ruled the tragedy a case of accidental drowning.

Her uncle Dekzod Isokov told the New York Post: 'They walked off, and we didn't know,' he said. The boy was later found soaked, but safe, in bushes and woods near the lake.

Officers combed the 585-acre park from bicycles and helicopters and underwater as members of the public also joined the search. 

Rushona Kurbonova's body was recovered by NYPD divers after she wandered off during a family picnic in Prospect Park, Brooklyn and drowned in the lake

Shavonne Dillard was having a picnic with fellow members of her Pentecostal congregation when she witnessed the tragic scenes. She said: 'My
 whole church family was looking for this baby, and we were praying out 
here,'

Ms Dillard said Rushona's 37-year-old mother paced by the lake as the massive search was underway. 'She was frantic,' added Ms Dillard.

As the dive team brought Rushona's body to the shore, her mother collapsed and was taken to hospital suffering from shock.

Brooklyn Borough president, Eric Adams said: 'No parent should ever have to bury a child. We all have a part to play in promoting safe play conditions.'

Zada Bacoj, superintendent of the tragic family's Brooklyn apartment building told the Daily News that the toddler was 'a little angel.

'What bigger heartbreak than this?' he added.

The family were described as incredibly hard working with Rushona's father driving a taxi.

The parents were described as devoted to their three children.

Rushova went missing around 1pm, launching a frantic five-hour search, combing the 585-acre park.

Another 
witness, Angela Peterson, said she saw an older boy she believed to be 
the girl's older brother running though the park shouting in another 
language as the mother frantically trailed after him.

She said: 'I heard the mother say, "Oh my god! Oh my god!" She was so distraught,' Peterson recalled.

A person called 911 saying a woman approached her shouting 'my babies!'

'She
 didn’t speak much English.

'The mother was in a 
terrible shock — that feeling when you lose something and you go numb. I
 know the park like the back of my hand but for a child…it’s almost like
 a maze, a game.'

Police sources said the lake bottom is like quick sand while there was almost zero visibility under the water due to the green algae covering the surface.
