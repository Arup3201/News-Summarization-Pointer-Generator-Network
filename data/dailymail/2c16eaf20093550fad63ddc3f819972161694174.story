It's makers had hoped it would be the next big adventure movie franchise.

Disney had even planned sequels and a theme park.

But John Carter, an unlikely tale about an American Civil War soldier who ends up on Mars, is on course to lose more money than any movie in history.

Its producers admitted the film, released in the UK a fortnight ago, is set for losses of more than £120million.

Colossal flop: Science-fiction action film John Carter has made about $184million in ticket sales worldwide so far. But box office receipts are split roughly in half with cinema owners and it cost $250million and a further $100million to promote

Disney, which was hoping the 3D 
production would achieve the same success as its Pirates of the 
Caribbean series, lavished close to £160million making John Carter and a
further £63million on global marketing and advertising.

The film features newcomer Taylor Kitsch as Carter along with British 
stars Samantha Morton, Dominic West, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hinds.

But the company has now projected that it will lose millions after it failed to impress critics and the public alike.

Audience reviews have branded it ‘dull’, ‘pointless’ and ‘too long’.

Literary origins: The movie starring model/actor Taylor Kitsch (pictured) was based on a series of books written by the late Edgar Rice Burroughs, starting with A Princess Of Mars in 1912 and ending with John Carter Of Mars, published posthumously in 1964

This list features the films that have lost the most money, adjusted for inflation, for the Hollywood studio that bankrolled the movie.

It does not take into account the losses suffered by the distributor and cinemas. If so, these figures would actually be much higher.

The biggest money-losing films ever are:

BBC reviewer Mark Kermode said: ‘The storytelling is incomprehensible, 
the characterisation is ludicrous, the story is two and a quarter hours 
long and it’s a boring, boring, boring two and a quarter hours long.’

Disney said John Carter had brought in about £116million in ticket sales
worldwide so far but it retains only £58million of that as the money is
split equally with cinema chains.

A spokesman confirmed: ‘In light of the theatrical performance of John 
Carter, we expect the film to generate an operating loss of 
approximately $200million (£126million).’

He added that its failure would mean the studio itself will lose up to 
£76million for the quarter as the profits from other films and  ventures
are not enough to break even.

Disney would not confirm the total budget of the film as it has held the
rights since 2007 and spent additional money on developing the idea.

But industry sources have said it may need to gross more than £380million for the film to make all its money back.

The poor performance of the film is a surprise, because its director, 
Pixar’s Andrew Stanton, had previously achieved acclaim with Finding 
Nemo and Wall-E.

John Carter is based on a series of books written by Edgar Rice 
Burroughs, who also created Tarzan. The stories follow a war veteran who
finds himself transported to Mars and battling to save the planet’s 
inhabitants.

The series began with A Princess of Mars in 1912 and ended with John Carter of Mars, published after the author’s death in 1964.

Biggest flop: Pirate romp Cutthroat Island (1995) starred Geena Davis and Matthew Modine and lost studio MGM $147,157,68

Industry experts believe Disney’s figures for John Carter make it the biggest box office disaster ever.

But it is difficult to make comparisons as studios reveal little financial detail and allowances have to be made for inflation.

When Kevin Costner’s ambitious £96million epic Waterworld was released 
in 1995 it was condemned as the biggest film flop of all time.

But the film went on to break even through worldwide sales and then made
more money with lucrative tie-ins from a video game and theme park 
attractions at Universal Studios in Hollywood, Japan and Singapore.

Heaven’s Gate, a Wild West movie starring Kris Kristofferson, was one of
the most critically derided bombs in Hollywood history, costing 
£27.7million to make but taking only £2.12million when it was released 
in 1980.
