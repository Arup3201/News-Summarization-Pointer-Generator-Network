It might not have been the result he was hoping for, but Charlotte Hind tried her best to cheer up Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers as the pair left Anfield together earlier this week. 

The couple were seen walking side-by-side as they left the ground on Sunday afternoon following the club's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United.

Although Mr Rodgers looked less than pleased with the day's events, his girlfriend was all smiles as she stepped out with her boyfriend and daughter, dressed head-to-toe in black.

The manager look straight-faced as he left the club following the team's defeat to Manchester United - but his girlfriend was all smiles 

The 31-year-old, who had the young girl with former husband Steven Hind, has been dating the Liverpool boss since the middle of last year.

The mother-of-one, who was pushing her daughter's buggy, has now been spotted several times at the ground. 

Mr Rodgers, who was wearing a club-coloured red tie, took over at Liverpool FC in the summer of 2012, after previously guiding Swansea City into the Premier League.

The move made him one of the most high-profile figures in the football world.

The manager, who grew up in Northern Ireland and previously held the top job at Watford and Reading, has adopted a new and more fashionable image in recent months.

He has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground.

Mr Rogers met his wife Susan when he was a young player at Reading Football Club.

The couple have two children, Oldham Athletic footballer Anton, 20, and daughter Mischa,17. 

But he split from his wife, with whom he had been for more than 12 years, just more than one year ago.

Since then, Mr Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football.

The 41-year-old has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight after exercising at the club's Melwood training ground. 

The father-of-two also moved from the family home into a £1.2million flat.
