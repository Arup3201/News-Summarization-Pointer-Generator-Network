After 10 league games without a goal or assist Peter Crouch got one of each. 

Mark Hughes is braced for a fight to keep Peter Crouch, claiming the Stoke striker gets better as he gets older.

Crouch, a boyhood QPR fan, scored one goal and created another, leaving Rangers boss Harry Redknapp to admit he would like the 33-year-old back at Loftus Road. 

Stoke boss Hughes said he expected bids in January, adding: ‘My game wasn’t based on pace and I carried on until I was 38, so he has the potential.’

Crouch got the better of Rio Ferdinand (R) by claiming a goal and assist against the veteran defender

The former England striker made fellow veteran Rio Ferdinand look his age after beating him in the air to set up Mame Biram Diouf's opener and losing the defender in the box to  fire in Stoke's second.

Crouch also beat the former Manchester United captain for pace during a rare run down the wing that left Ferdinand trailing in his wake.

Niko Kranjcar equalised with a late free-kick to leave Hughes ruing a missed opportunity.

‘The overriding emotion is disappointment,’ said former QPR boss Hughes. ‘We allowed them back into the game and it should have already been too far away from them.’
