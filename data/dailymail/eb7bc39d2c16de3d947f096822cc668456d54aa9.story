The son of an elderly hospital patient who was 'starved to death' on the Liverpool Care Pathway has called for police to launch a murder inquiry.

Peter Tulloch believes the death of his mother, Jean Tulloch, was the result of 'negligent' and 'unlawful' care at the Western General hospital in Edinburgh.

The 56-year-old has urged police to take action after an independent medical report found Mrs Tulloch had gone without food or water for up to 30 hours in the weeks before her death.

Jean Tulloch, 83, died in March after being placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway at Edinburgh's Western General hospital

The widow was left without food or water for up to 30 hours by doctors who provided 'unlawful' and 'negligent' care, according to the independent report

The care-home resident died aged 83 in March after being admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection. 

An investigation was launched into her death earlier this year by the Crown Office after her son raised concerns about the standard of care provided by doctors on the Liverpool Care Pathway.

However an independent medical report found 'the starvation diet' his mother received on what Mr Tulloch describes as 'the death pathway' directly contributed to her death.

Mr Tulloch has notified the report's findings to Lothian and Borders Police, who have referred the matter to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.

'I have called for a murder inquiry to be opened into this now.

It is claimed the 83-year-old went without food or water for up to 30 hours without her legal guardian's permission

'As far as I'm concerned this is proof that my mum was neglected in hospital,' said Mr Tulloch, a London Underground systems engineer.

'I was worried that my mother was not being fed at the time and raised the issue in formal complaints which were not treated properly.

'No attempt to feed her was ever made.

'She was let down by the NHS and I want answers.

'Doctors and nurses should face stiff penalties for neglect.

'A few prominent convictions would concentrate people’s minds and prevent a lot of the abuse that has been exposed recently.'

A Crown Office spokesperson said: 'The Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit is considering the facts and circumstances of the death of Jean Tulloch.'

Mr Tulloch claims staff at the hospital put his ailing mother on the Liverpool Care Pathway without proper consent, and ignored his rights to make decisions on her behalf as her legally appointed welfare guardian.

In the weeks before her death, it is alleged doctors detached a drip providing Mrs Tulloch with vital fluids without her son's permission.

The report comes as both the Scottish and UK Governments look to introduce harsher punishment for doctors found guilty of wilful neglect.

Mrs Tulloch, a retired nurse, was admitted to hospital in March with a urinary tract infection.

Though doctors were able to stabalise her condition, her family was told she had only three weeks to live.

But Mr Tulloch claims when he visited his mother at the Edinburgh hospital she was 'far from dying'.

He says the 83-year-old was able to smile and communicate, but was unable to talk because of sores in her mouth.

Doctors told the family to return to their homes where they would be notified of any change in her condition.

Upon a visit the following day however, Mr Tulloch claims he found his mother had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway, a course of treatment designed to allow 'people with a terminal illness to die with dignity', according to the NHS. 

Doctors took Mrs Tulloch off the treatment plan following her son's objections, but she died two weeks later. 

Cameron Fyfe, the lawyer responsible for commissioning the report said: 'Peter instructed me to obtain a report from an expert consultant on whether his mother was deprived of nutrition by the hospital.

'The expert believes this was the case and that the lack of nutrition materially contributed to Mrs Tulloch’s death.

'We have now intimated a claim for compensation against the Health Board.'

A spokesperson for NHS Lothian said: 'We cannot comment on individual patient cases and as this is now a legal issue it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'
