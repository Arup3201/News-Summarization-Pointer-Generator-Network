His unexpected injury caused a large state of panic for Arsenal supporters, but Mesut Ozil is already back in the gym working on his return to fitness.

The playmaker, signed for £42.5million last summer, was ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with a knee ligament injury.

The German Football Federation sent him home from international duty because of the knock, and he has now tweeted a picture of himself lifting weights as he looks to regain fitness.

Ozil was absent for the Gunners' narrow victory over Anderlecht on Wednesday night, and admitted he was relieved after two goals in two minutes late on in Brussels.

He tweeted: 'I'm relieved about yesterday's victory but nevertheless these weights feel heavy on my shoulders...' 

Ozil's team-mates Laurent Koscielny, David Ospina, Yaya Sanogo, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud are also out injured.
