When the sun is shining, there's nothing like an ice-cold drink to cool you down.

However, guests at the Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa in Tokyo might be left feeling a little hot under the collar when they receive the bill for their chilled frappe.

The five-star resort has started selling the large bowls of icy raspberry flavoured drink topped with Dom Perignon - that can be eaten with a spoon.

Nice ice! The frappe cocktail served at the Grand Prince Hotel in Tokyo will set you back £200

However, the drink will set you back nearly £200.

Although the bowl does contain enough frozen frappe to serve seven glasses - so if you split the bill with a few friends, it's £30 a head. 

Served in a silver bowl, the frozen pink slush is sprinkled with a gold leaf design and features large chunks of frozen fruit.

Do you want ice with that? The frozen cocktail is served in a silver bowl in martini glasses and champagne

A sommelier will also prepare guests drinks in a cocktail glass, finishing it off by pouring a generous drop of bubbly on top of the ice.

The champagne beverage is only on sale until September 12.
