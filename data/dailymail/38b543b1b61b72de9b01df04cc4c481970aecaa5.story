The parents of a boy shot dead in the US school massacre have called for gun control laws to be passed immediately.

Dylan Hockley was one of 20 children and six teachers killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last month by gunman Adam Lanza.

The British-born six-year-old had moved to the US with his family, including older brother Jake, from Eastleigh in Hampshire two years ago.

Remembered: Six-year-old Dylan Hockley, who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting last month, was described as fun-loving and incredibly empathetic by his parents

Fears: Patents Ian Hockley and his wife Nicole told the BBC they were concerned that moves to introduce tighter gun controls in the wake of the tragedy will amount to nothing

Talking to the BBC, his father Ian 
said: 'The unthinkable has happened. All the shootings that have come 
before have indeed been terrible tragedies, but now it's sunk so low 
that very small children have now been the target of this.

'How could it possibly get worse? If 
they cannot address this now, it's as if they think they can never 
address it and they will give up and this will go on.'

During the interview, Dylan's mother Nicole told how she looked for her son at the school after the shootings.

'After a while, as the kids were all 
leaving with their parents, you just start wandering around thinking, "Where's mine?",' she said.

'The police confirmed that 20 
children had been shot and the room erupted. And I remember I started 
shaking - and I just couldn't stop for the life of me,' said Mrs 
Hockley.

Protector: Dylan's parents said that they were comforted to know that their son had died in the arms of his beloved teacher Anne Marie Murphy

Dylan's body was found in the embrace of his classroom assistant, Anne Marie Murphy.

'Dylan was wrapped in Mrs Murphy's 
arms," said Mrs Hockley. "She was protecting several children, but Dylan
was the one that was actually in her arms. And that helps a little 
bit.'

President Barack Obama is expected to
put pressure on Congress to come up with 'concrete proposals' on 
tighter gun control, a spokesman said.

But the move is certain to spark 
opposition from Republicans in Congress and from pro-gun lobby 
organisation the National Rifle Association

Americans still seem to support gun 
control one month after the massacre with a Washington Post/ABC poll 
published yesterday showing that 52 per cent say they support gun 
controls in the wake of Newtown.

As the Hockleys try to come to terms 
with the devastating loss of their son, they have decided to move house 
as driving past the home of gunman Adam Lanza is more than they can cope
with each day.

Mrs Hockley said: 'You can't drive up your driveway every 
day and see the house of a person who took your son's life and who 
brought so much pain to so many people.'

Dylan's older brother Jake is also struggling to come to terms with the 
loss of his sibling and the many questions he has as to why this 
happened.
