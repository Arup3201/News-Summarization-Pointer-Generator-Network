A fisherman has caught what is thought to be a record-breaking snakehead in the waters of the Pomtomac in Maryland.

The whopper was four foot long and weighed in at 18lbs - 1lb heavier than the previous record caught in Japan.

Snakehead fish have become a pest in Maryland after infiltrating the waters a decade ago - being nicknamed Frankenfish because of their unfortunate looks.

What lies beneath: This terrifying snakehead fish could be a world record breaker - weighing in at 18lbs

Hideous: The snakehead fish has been nicknamed the Frankenfish because of its repulsive appearance

The state of Maryland are keen to rid the Pomtomac of the fish because it is a voracious top-level predator, meaning that it has no natural enemies, and could decimate populations of native fish.

About 90 per cent of it's diet consists of other fish and it is even known to swallow sea bass whole.

But this snakehead fish is anything but ugly to Juan Duran who was beaming as he was interviewed about his catch by a local news reporter from CBS Baltimore.Â 

Smiling: Angler Juan Duran is thrilled at the catch and tells CBS Baltimore that he doesn't think the fish are ugly at all

'They'll take your thumb off!': Juan warns that you shouldn't touch the beasts from beneath while they are still alive

Grinning Juan said: 'I think they are really cool looking, I like the way they look. They fight hard and they are really aggressive but you can catch them on any bass fishing lures.'

He told how you shouldn't touch the fish while it was still alive because its fangs would 'tear your thumb off' and how he thought the fish's pattern looked like a 'diamond-back rattlesnake'.

It's been eight years since a snakehead fish was discovered in the Potomac. But biologists would rather see them gone and the state have offered to give the angler with the biggest catch a $200 gift certificate.

'Slippery and aggressive': At 18lbs the it needs strength and dedication to reel a snakehead in

Fangs: Luckily this snakehead is dead but you wouldn't want to have your fingers so close to a live one
