When their five-year-old pestered them to let him play on their iPad, Greg and Sharon Kitchen’s first instinct was to say No.

But faced with the distraction of a house full of visitors, along with their son’s insistence that the game he wanted to play was free, and you might understand why they eventually said Yes.

That decision was a costly one. The next day they found out their son Danny’s little game-playing session had cost them £1,700.

Oops! Five-year-old Danny Kitchen was left in tears after his parents told him how much money he had spent

Yesterday the Kitchens warned other 
parents of the danger of allowing children to play ‘free’ games which 
come with hidden costs. Although Apple has since refunded the full 
amount, the family said it has been a tough lesson to learn.

Danny had asked his father for a 
passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves 
touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies.

His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at 
their home.

But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’.

His mother knew nothing about his 
subsequent spending spree until she saw emails from iTunes the following
 day listing what he had bought.

‘Danny was pestering us to let him have a go on the iPad,’ she said from the family home in Warmley, near Bristol.

‘He kept saying it was a free game so my husband put in the passcode and handed it to him.

The app involves throwing darts and bombs at zombies and users can get extras... but at a cost

The game is free but the creators get their money from extra weapons

‘It worried me when he asked  for the
 password but I had a look  at the game, it said it was free  so I 
didn’t think there would be a problem.

'We had lots of visitors in the house
 and were both a little preoccupied. I woke up Monday morning and looked
 at my emails and had loads from iTunes.

'I thought it must be a mistake, so I 
checked my bank balance online and nothing had been taken out. I thought
 nothing of it until my credit card adviser phoned and told me they had 
authorise  the transaction.’

Danny had bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time.

‘I can’t believe he was able to spend 
so much,’ said Mrs Kitchen, a mother of five who runs a children’s 
entertainment business with her husband.

‘It was far too easy a thing for  him to do and more should be done to limit stuff like this from happening.

‘I told Danny he’d better get ready for bed and run and hide before Daddy got home.

‘Through his tears he turned  back and
 said “But where can I hide?” Bless him – that stopped me being angry 
but of course, it’s a lot  of money.’

Danny said: ‘I said to Dad can you put
 the passcode for the game, he said no and then I said it was free so he
 said yes. The next day it cost lots of money. I was worried and I felt 
sad. I was crying. I’m not sure how I did it, I thought it was free.

‘I’m banned from the iPad now.’

Mr Kitchen, 44, said: ‘I was livid. 
Not amused at all. But Danny was very sorry so I couldn’t stay mad at 
him for long. I’m relieved that they have said they are going to give us
 back our money.’

An Apple spokesman said it was vital that parents kept
 their passcodes safe and  said software was available to  prevent 
children from using the iTunes store.

In an email to Mr Kitchen the company 
said iPads, iPhones and iPod touches have built-in parental controls to 
restrict access to content. They also have the option to turn off 
‘in-app purchases’.

The Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps entirely.

Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether.

It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content.

To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'.

Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm.

Now you can set restrictions from the menu below.

In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills.

Angry Birds, pictured, was one of the games featured in a lawsuit in America over children running up huge bills on 'free' games

Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps.

Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards.

Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children.

These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game.

When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged.

Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011.

But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills.

A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

The company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK.

Those claiming $30 or more from Apple may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an iTunes store credit, according to the filing.

The case involves games such as Angry Birds, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as Apple's iPad.
