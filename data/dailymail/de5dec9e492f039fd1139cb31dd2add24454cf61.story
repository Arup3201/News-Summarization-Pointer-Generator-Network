They sent a creepy feeling through several Southern California families, but authorities say the person who left porcelain dolls on doorsteps didn't mean any harm.

The woman, who hasn't been named, told investigators she was 'embarrassed' by the concern she caused among the families.

The Orange County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that someone had left the dolls wearing nightgowns and lace dresses at as many as eight homes in a San Clemente neighborhood this week.

Disturbing: This doll was left outside of a home in California where a little girl lives with her family - 10 others have also been found

Mystery: At least 11 porcelain dolls were left outside homes in this gated California community

The families were worried because they 
felt each doll resembled a young girl who lived in the house, setting 
off an investigation and call for public help in finding who had placed 
them.

'Because her intentions were good, she 
felt embarrassed at the fear she instilled in the community,' Orange 
County Sheriff's Lieutenant Jeff Hallock told the Los Angeles Times.

'She just thought she was being nice.'

The woman had deliberately matched up the dolls with the girls, thinking they would appreciate the gesture.

As
 many as 11 California families from the gated residential community in 
San Clemente, Orange County, came forward to report finding the dolls on their doorsteps.

The dolls began appearing on doorsteps on July 16. All the girls who received one were aged around 10 years old, and some attend the same elementary school.

'Families in each of the homes where porcelain dolls were left voiced concern that the dolls resembled their daughters,' the Sheriff’s Department stated in a news release.

Photographs of two of the dolls provided by police show one curly-headed and dressed in a pink nightie with bunny slippers, and the other in a ruffled blue dress.

After finding the person responsible, the police said the dolls had been left outside the homes as a 'gesture of goodwill'.

Bizarre: Police don't know if the dolls are meant as gifts or indicate something more concerning

The dolls are currently being stored in the police department's evidence room.

Families who received one of the dolls helped solve the mystery, after realizing that many of them attended the same church.

Police contacted a woman who was part of their church, and who the families said may have been behind the gesture.

According to the OC Register, the woman admitted she had left the dolls outside the houses, and told police she had just been trying to get rid of her collection.

Investigation: Police were called by concerned families after dolls resembling their children were left outside houses

Orange County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Jeff Hallock said the police became involved because the case appeared to involve children.

'Obviously, there’s an indication by some the parents that the dolls resemble their daughters. We’re talking about children here. Anything that has the potential to involve children causes us some concern,' he told KTLA.

The dolls were first reported on Tuesday and were taken as evidence by police.
