Belgian Bob Peeters has been named as the new manager of Charlton Athletic.

The former Millwall striker replaces Jose Riga in the Addicks' hotseat and was confirmed as Charlton's new head coach on Tuesday evening.

The 40-year-old arrives at The Valley from Waasland-Beveren who play in the Belgian top-flight.

Gone: Jose Riga left Charlton with his contract due to expire this summer

Former boss Riga, 56, was only appointed as manager by new owner Roland Duchatelet in March with the Addicks staring at relegation from the Championship.

And even though Riga won three of the last four matches to save Charlton, the club decided to let him leave ahead of his contract expiring this summer.

The swift change in management shouldn't come as a surprise under Duchatelet's stewardship, with the owner renowned for tinkering.

Chris Powell was sacked by the club two months ago, while captain Johnnie Jackson insistent that Riga should have remained with the club ahead of next season.

'He has been good since he came in,' Jackson said earlier this month. 'You can see the way he wants to play and he understands the Championship. If he was given time to implement his methods, we would have the making of a good side.'

Peeters spent two years playing at The Den having signed from Vitesse Arnhem in 2003 and scored three goals in 25 appearances for the Lions.
