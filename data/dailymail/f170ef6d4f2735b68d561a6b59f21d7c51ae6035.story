Cardiff Blues and the WRU are on standby to offer Leigh Halfpenny a swift return to Wales if Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal carries out his threat to tear up the full back’s contract.

The 25-year-old British Lion is yet to play for the French club after a summer move, as he continues to struggle with a groin problem. Toulon fear that he could need another operation and may opt to release him.

Boudjellal told Toulon newspaper Var Matin: ‘The problem that we have now is that we think he may have arrived at Toulon with that injury. If this is the case, we haven’t ruled out terminating his contract. We’re conducting an investigation. We don’t feel like preparing Halfpenny for Wales, just for the Rugby World Cup.’

The WRU and regions recently announced a six-year deal which includes provision to place top Welsh players on dual contracts and that would be an option if Halfpenny became available.

The Blues’ chief executive Richard Holland said: ‘Of course we would be interested, be that on a dual contract or a regional deal.

‘We would be extremely keen to have back a player of Leigh’s calibre. If the reports are true, we are keen to explore this.’

England wing Jack Nowell is on course for an imminent return to first-team action after a successful comeback on Monday, following shoulder and knee surgery.

The 21-year-old, who last played in March, scored two tries in a 34-minute cameo as Exeter Chiefs earned a 45-7 ‘A’-league victory over London Welsh.
