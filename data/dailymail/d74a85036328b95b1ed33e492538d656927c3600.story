Many teenagers' rooms smell like a farmyard, but at least Nasar has an excuse.

He is constantly staring at himself in the mirror, goes days without a shower and is noisy in the small hours, because he is a horse.

The three-year-old castrated Arabian horse fled inside his owners' thatched house during a storm in December, and now he doesn't want to leave.

Stable home: Nasar the three-year-old castrated Arabian horse moved into his owner Stephanie Arndt's house in Holt, Germany, during a hurricane-force storm

Good neigh-bour: Nasar comes and goes as he pleases and sometimes he bugs Stephanie for a glass of juice. His manners are just dreadful though - he slurps terribly

What's on TV tonight? Nasar begs to be let into the living room, left, and once he is inside he completely dominates it - to which Ms Arndt (pictured) can't help but laugh

His owner Stephanie Arndt, from the village of Holt in northern Germany, told Die Welt the horse likes to play the keyboard and drink juice.

He took refuge indoors when much of northern Europe including Britain was battered by the hurricane-strength storm Xaver in December, whose fatalities included a lorry driver in West Lothian and a man crushed by a tree near Nottingham.

So far he has been neater and tidier than many teenagers.

He helps his owner sort out her firewood and the biggest damage he has caused has been a smashed cup, which earned him a stern talking-to.

Ms Arndt, a 39-year-old doctor, said: 'He doesn't like rain and wind... He thought it was very appropriate. Sometimes he stands before the mirror and bobs his head.'

Trotting out his favourite tunes: Nasar's hobbies include playing the keyboard with his face and looking at his long straight hair in the mirror. Like any teenager, then

Why the long face? Like so many teenagers, Nasar is obsessed with looking at his own reflection. Unlike most teenagers, his hair has already gone grey

Home sweet home: Owner Stephanie Arndt defended herself for allowing Nasar into her home, saying: 'I do not think he's in the house against his will'

Nasar usually sleeps outside like a normal horse, preferring to roam indoors during the day, but that does not stop him and Ms Arndt taking the occasional nap.

At the age of three, he is the equine equivalent of a human teenager as he is almost at full maturity.

So shouldn't he be roaming free in the fields, his owner was asked.

Ms Arndt replied he had 'never cared seriously' for his paddock and stable.

She added: 'I do not think he's in the house against his will.'

Does my bum look big in this? As with any stroppy teenager, it is probably not a good idea to startle Nasar from behind. He might not take too kindly to it

What are you up to? Nasar has taken a liking to Ms Arndt's straw filing boxes, possibly because they remind him of the sleeping material inside his stable

Time to hit the hay? Despite being enormous, Nasar feels comfortable in the little thatched house and is known to take the odd nap with his owner

Mine! So far Nasar has caused almost no damage. His owner said the worst so far was a smashed cup - which earned him a very stern talking to. He hasn't done it again
