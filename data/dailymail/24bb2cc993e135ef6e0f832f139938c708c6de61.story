America's favourite chocolate bar – the Hershey bar – is to go GM-free amid growing concerns in the US about ‘Frankenstein food’.

The firm has announced that it will no longer use genetically modified sugar beet or soya lecithin in its milk chocolate bars and packs of chocolate drop ‘Kisses’.

The issue has come to a head in America because of efforts to introduce a law requiring firms to label the use of GM ingredients – as happens in Britain and Europe.

Going GM-free: Chocolate brand Hershey is caving into consumer pressure by dropping genetically modified products - including GM sugar beet and soya lecithin - from the recipe of its bars and chocolate drops

The State of Vermont has voted for GM labelling to come into effect in 2016 and it seems likely to trigger a domino effect with others expected to follow suit.

Once some states require the labelling of GM ingredients like sugar, corn and soya, national food chains will have little option but to adopt the policy across North America.

GM crops like sugar beet, corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment.

The plants have been altered through the insertion of foreign genes that create toxins to kill insects or give them immunity to spraying with powerful chemical weed killers.

There is evidence from the US that certain weeds have developed immunity to the same weed killers with the result that they are taking over many fields.

At the same time, the use of sprays alongside the GM crops is thought to have caused a collapse in the population of the Monarch butterfly, which is now under threat.

Last year, Tesco was criticised for selling a number of American products, including Hershey bars, Oreo Mint Cream biscuits, and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups containing GM ingredients.

The use of GM ingredients has to be included on the labels of the products sold in the UK, however – currently – it is not required on the other side of the Atlantic.

The campaigning group, Green America, welcomed the decision by Hershey as an ‘important move and great first step’.

Its Campaigns Director, Nicole McCann, said: ‘As one of the leading chocolate companies in the US, this commitment will help move the rest of the companies in this sector.

‘Hershey’s joins General Mills, Unilever, Post Foods, and other leading companies in responding to consumer demand to make at least some of its products non-GM.’

The GMO Inside group has led a consumer campaign to put pressure on food giants to stop using GM ingredients.

Its co-chairman, John Roulac, said:’ ‘Hershey’s needs to take the next step and go non-GMO with all of its chocolates, and get third-party verification for non-GMO ingredients.’

Hershey’s said its change to the products is part of a wider initiative to simplify ingredients used in its products and remove artificial additives.

For Hershey’s Milk Chocolate and Kisses, the company will move to natural vanilla, nongenetically modified sugar and milk from cows that have not been treated with the growth hormone rBST.

Director of corporate communications, Jeff Beckman, said: ‘We are looking closely at every ingredient in our products and how we describe them. We will strive for simplicity with all of our ingredients, but we may not achieve it with every product.

‘We are leading industry conversations with suppliers and building our manufacturing capabilities to pursue non-genetically modified ingredients. This is a long-term journey and we are starting with some of our largest and most popular brands.

‘The ingredients we are transitioning to non-GM in both Hershey’s Kisses Milk Chocolates and Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar are sugar and soy lecithin.’

In the US, Hershey also intends to roll out ‘simple snacking products’ without high fructose corn syrup or artificial colours and flavours, such as Brookside Dark Chocolate Fruit & Nut Bars.

It also plans to introduce a full ingredient glossary and profiles of the firm’ s suppliers on its website.
