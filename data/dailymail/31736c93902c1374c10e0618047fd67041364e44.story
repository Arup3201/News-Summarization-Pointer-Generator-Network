Nato is investigating claims that its computer network has been infiltrated after a group of hackers boasted they had breached the organisation's security.

Hacking group Anonymous bragged that they had 'breached' Nato's security and published two classified documents to prove their claims.

The group wrote on Twitter: ‘Yes, Nato was breached. And we have lots of restricted material. In the next days, wait for interesting data.’

Defiant: The hacking group Anonymous brazenly poked fun at FBI and Nato

It added: ‘We are sitting on about one gigabyte of data from Nato now, most of which we cannot publish as it would be irresponsible.’

The hackers also posted links to two documents to prove their claims.

The first, dated August 27 2007 and marked ‘Nato Restricted’, is a technical document about communication systems at the Joint Communications Control Centre for ISAF forces in Afganistan.

The second document, dated 2008 and also
marked ‘Nato Restricted’, covers proposals for outsourcing 
communications systems for Nato forces in Kosovo.

Defiant: The hacking group have declared a war against anyone who tries to stop them infiltrating the system

A Nato spokesman said the organisation was investigating the claims from Anonymous.

He said: ‘Nato is aware that a hackers group has released what it claims to be Nato classified documents on the internet.

'Nato security experts are investigating these claims. We strongly condemn any leak of classified documents, which can potentially endanger the security of Nato Allies, armed forces and citizens.’

Anonymous then took to Twitter to mock Nato, saying they had seen their security procedures, but it would appear 'nobody ever read them'.

Then they said they laughed at Nato's 'battleships' in the war against hackers.

They released a statement to the authorities telling them to expect more hacking,' they wrote.

'These governments and corporations are our enemy.

'And we will continue to fight them, with all methods we have at our disposal, and that certainly includes breaking into their websites and exposing their lies.'

The hacking group is a loosely organized group of hackers sympathetic to WikiLeaks. Along with its splinter group LulzSec, It has claimed responsibility for attacks against corporate and government websites worldwide.

Anonymous claims credit for disrupting the websites of Visa and MasterCard in December when the credit card companies stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.

Hackers from both have attacked websites including those of the CIA in America and SOCA in Britain, and infiltrated networks belonging to Sony.

Earlier this week LulzSec hacked into The Sun newspaper website and published a fake news story claiming Rupert Murdoch had died of metal poisoning.

On Tuesday U.S. authorities announced 14 arrests in connection with December attacks on Internet payment service PayPal that were claimed by Anonymous.

After the international raid two other Americans, four Dutch nationals and one Briton were arrested on suspicion of participating in other attacks against companies and organizations, U.S. authorities said.

The crackdown -the biggest reaction so far by U.S. authorities to a string of cyber attack - has so far resulted in more than 60 arrests in Britain, the US, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey.

The swoop, which seized computers and 
other records, was meant to serve as a deterrent to others who may be 
considering joining the cause.

Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer.

The FBI's arrests is providing a treasure trove of information and will lead to further arrests, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters on Thursday.

The law enforcement official said: 'This is the good example of a significant event that successfully removed a number of individuals from being part of the problem and will certainly lead to information that will result in locating other subjects.'

While attacks by Anonymous and related 'hacktivist' groups have drawn wide attention, other cyber crimes aimed at espionage are a higher priority for the FBI. The latter have included intrusions at Google, Lockheed Martin and the International Monetary Fund.

'We didn't pull resources away from those higher priority cases to work this,' the official said.

Yet Anonymous and Lulz Security, issued a defiant statement on Twitter saying they would continue their efforts.

In an indication that they would increase their hacking efforts if interfered with, Anonymous Tweeted to the FBI: 'The more you arrest, the louder we'll roar.'

James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said U.S. authorities were trying to warn people that they would track down hackers.

'I think they (the FBI) are trying to send a signal that this isn't cost-free in the hopes that it will scare off some of the others. If we're lucky it will work,' Mr Lewis said.

The law enforcement official said that people allegedly involved in the cyber attacks might no realize just how serious the crimes were and that prosecutors would likely seek stiff sentences.

Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer.

'They're probably not the types of people who have been prepared for any time in jail. This is not a joke,' the official said.

'The reality of the fact that this is both a crime and that people will be actually doing time in jail I think really hasn't sunk in to a lot of people who are getting involved in these activities.'

Lewis said one possible benefit from the cyber attacks is that it will lead network and website administrators to beef up their security.

'These guys exploit poor configuration, and that's the simplest thing to fix but there's just so much of it out there it will take a while,' Mr Lewis said.
