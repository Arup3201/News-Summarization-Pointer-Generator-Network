Hannah Wise learned at a young age that the U.S. court system can work in her favor.

The 10-year-old was reunited with her poodle named Mystery on Friday after suing her mom's ex-boyfriend Mitchell Rechter for keeping the dog when the couple broke up.

'I started crying,' Hannah told the Detroit News. 'It's amazing. Right now he's snuggling with me.'

Girl's best friend: Ten-year-old Hannah Wise was reunited with her beloved poodle Mystery on Friday after suing her mom's ex-boyfriend for custody

The dog was returned to Hannah's mom Adrienne Lenhoff on Friday afternoon. Hannah was told she might get the dog back that day but was still surprised when she saw the dog in her house after school.

'Mystery greeted her at the door when she walked in, and she burst into tears,' Ms Lenhoff told the Detroit Free Press.

Hannah says it was was 'one of the happiest days of my life'.

But the lawsuit against Rechter isn't over. Ms Lenhoff is suing him for $54,000 following a nasty break-up.

Ms Lenhoff and her daughter moved out of his house last spring after coming home to find him 'having relations with someone Adrienne later learned was a convicted felon'.

Lenhoff says she also fronted money to renovate Rechter's condo and take trips together, which is incorporated into the $54,000 lawsuit.

The break-up: Hannah and her mom Adrienne Lenhoff moved out of Mitchell Rechter's condo when they found him cheating. He agreed to take care of Mystery while they looked for a new place

Split: Ms Lenhoff is also asking for some of her other possessions to be returned to her including jewelry, accessories, golf shoes, Ugg boots and a Cuisinart toaster

She also wants compensation for moving and storage costs, the cost of her Jewish marriage contract from her first marriage, that Rechter ripped up, and other items he has refused to return including jewelry, accessories, golf shoes, Ugg boots and a Cuisinart toaster.

Lenhoff said Rechter became a father figure to her daughter during their relationship. She said the incident has given her daughter her first heartbreak.

'This has made her not trust adults,' Lenhoff said. 'A big part of her innocence has been taken from her because of this.

'These are lessons that no child 10 years old should have to be learning.'

Lenhoff and Rechter had discussed marriage and buying a home together during their relationship, leading Hannah's mother to sell their condo and move in with him.

The trial is scheduled for July 2014.
