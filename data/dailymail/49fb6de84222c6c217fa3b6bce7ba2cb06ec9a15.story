Fifteen tourists remain missing at sea and ten others, including two Britons, had to swim six hours to safety after a tour boat sank in rough seas off an Indonesian Island.

The British tourists were among ten passengers who survived the ordeal after swimming from the stricken vessel to a remote island where they were greeted by an erupting volcano and had to spend the night drinking their own urine.

They are now recovering in hospital while a huge search and rescue operation scours a 250 mile stretch of sea between the islands of Lombok, east of Bali, and Komodo Island, where the boat went down.

These are the first pictures to emerge of the tourists who were rescued when the tour boat went down in rough seas after hitting a reef between the Indonesian islands of Lombok, east of Bali, and Komodo Island

Among the ten rescued are two Britons and passengers from Germany, France, New Zealand and Spain

As well as the two Britons rescued from the stricken vessel, which sank after hitting a reef in huge waves on Saturday, passengers from Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain have also been saved.

However, 15 foreign passengers remain missing and the Foreign Office confirmed that more British nationals could be among them.

Indonesian officials said it was believed the boat was thrown onto a reef in rough seas and sank very quickly as it made the journey between the islands, which usually takes three days.

Bertrand Homassel, a French survivor, said the boat started sinking slowly after its hull was damaged in the storm and said he and the other survivors had to swim for several hours to shore to save themselves.

While six people managed to be taken to safety in a lifeboat, the others were forced to keep afloat for more than 12 hours in the water before taking action.

He said: 'Six people were in the lifeboat. The others climbed onto the roof of the boat, which had not completely sunk,' he said, speaking from a hotel in Bima on Sumbawa island, where the survivors were taken after being rescued.

The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to the Britons hospitalised after being rescued

'We waited until midday on Saturday. We were five kilometres (three miles) from the coast - there were many big waves separating us from the coast.

'People started to panic... Everyone took the decision to swim to the closest island, five kilometres away, where there was an erupting volcano.'

He said they swam for six hours and arrived on the island, Sangeang, as the sun was setting. They spent Saturday night there, surviving by drinking their own urine and eating leaves.

On Sunday, they attracted the attention of a passing boat by waving their life jackets, and were rescued and taken to Bima, he said.

'I was really very lucky,' Homassel added.

Indonesian police said they were not prepared to release the names of the others rescued until proof of identity could be ascertained – as all passports, credit cards, personal belongings were lost when the tour boat went down in the dark. 

The vessel sank while travelling between a notorious 250 mile stretch of water between the islands of Lombok, east of Bali (pictured) and Komodo Island. A total of 15 foreigners remain missing at sea after tragedy struck

The boat had set out to sail to the tourist attraction of Komodo Island, a drawcard because of the diving it attracts when seas are calm and because of the unique wildlife - the famous but fierce monitor lizards, also known as Komodo dragons.

The seas were rough throughout the journey and even on the island of Bali, hundreds of miles to the west, tourists were complaining of the high tides and strong winds.

Komodo Island is one of several islands which make up the Komodo National Park, a protected area that is home to the Komodo dragon. 

The huge lizards can grow up to three metres (10 feet) long and have a venomous bite.

Indonesia relies heavily on boats to connect its more than 17,000 islands, but has a poor maritime safety record.

Two vessels sank last month in different parts of the archipelago as millions travelled for the Muslim Eid holiday, leaving at least 36 people dead.

Fatal boat sinkings involving asylum-seeker vessels trying to make the treacherous sea crossing from Indonesia to Australia are also common.

But boat sinkings involving foreign tourists are rare, with accidents in Indonesia's booming aviation sector more of a danger for overseas visitors in recent years.

However, it was on the northern reaches of Sambawa Island - some 20 miles west of Komodo island - that the vessel came to grief.

Police on Sambawa Island's main town of Bima said it was believed that the vessel had been thrown onto the reef by the weather, damaged by the coral, and had sunk within minutes.

According to Suryman, a search and rescue official in Bima who, like many Indonesians uses only one name, the boat sank at night on Saturday.

'Fishermen managed to rescue five of them alive later at night on Saturday and then the other five were picked up by a sailing boat,' he said.

It is not known if the rescued British tourists are related, although one is believed to be male.

Budiawan, head of the search and rescue agency in Mataram, the provincial capital of West Nusatenggara, said the boat was carrying 20 foreign tourists, four Indonesian crewmen and an Indonesian guide when it sank just after midnight due to bad weather.

He said at least four ships were currently involved in the search and rescue mission.

Suryaman, a search and rescue official, said the boat had sunk in the early hours of Saturday, but it was not until Saturday evening that those who were rescued were picked up.

Tourist vessels and local fishermen have been scouring the area for survivors today, but their efforts have been hampered by dusk which has started to fall in the region.

While ten people have been rescued, the fate of the remaining 15 is unknown and there are grave fears for their safety after being in the sea for almost 24 hours.

The tourists were on their way to Komodo Island to see Komodo dragons (pictured) when the boat sank 

The Foreign Office confirmed other British nationals may have been involved in the accident.

A spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that two British nationals have been hospitalised following an incident in West Nusa Tenggara, Eastern Indonesia. We are providing consular assistance.

'We are in contact with the local authorities about the incident and stand ready to offer consular assistance to any other British nationals who may be involved.'

She would not comment on the state of their injuries.

Lombok is an island in the Indonesian archipelago, east of Bali. Home to around 3.1 million Indonesians, it attracts thousands of tourists every year.
