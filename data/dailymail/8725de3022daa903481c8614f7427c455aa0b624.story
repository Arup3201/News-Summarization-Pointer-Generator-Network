When Brendon Martin's wife turned her life around after suffering depression for seven years, he decided to start his own campaign to help those who also suffer from mental health illness.

The Gold Coast resident and gym owner has been taking part in '52 events in 52 weeks' this year to raise awareness on depression, anxiety, suicide, as well as funds for beyondblue.

The 38-year-old has been tackling endurance events across Australia, including a 12-hour dusk to dawn mountain-bike ride in Tamworth NSW and a 12 kilometre foot-race in Adelaide's Caudo Vineyards with more than 40 obstacles.

It comes after his wife, Jamie was diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of their third child. But after taking up exercising, she won the battle and 'returned back to her former self.'

'The exercise got her off the medication and it brought her back to normal,' Martin told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was a really difficult few years and she tried everything to alleviate but I'm so glad that by reaching out for support, she was able to begin a long journey of recovery and take back control of her life.

'For this reason, I felt compelled to do something physical to support beyondblue and promote keeping active and staying healthy.' 

The father of three has raised more than $11,000 for beyondblue during his challenge, called '52 for Blue', and is hoping to reach $52,000 by the end of year, which will be his 52nd and final round.

'It's been challenging trying to coordinate everything such as our businesses and not missing out on too much of the kids' activities but the most challenging part was the 50 kilometre stand-up paddle board.'

'I'm hoping to carry the event on again next year and inspire everyone to get together and help them achieve that goal.'

Martin's remaining five events will include a 50KM Ultramarathon from Kurrawa to Duranbah near the Gold Coast on Sunday December 14.

'I've been very humbled by the support I've received from my community and have often been lucky enough to have family members and friends join me for events,' Martin said.

'I am proud to be supporting beyondblue and look forward to pushing myself during the last few weeks of the challenge.'

Martin added: 'My advice to anyone who has experienced the impact of depression that it has on the person, family and friends - All you can do is really support them.

'Don't ever think it's you. It's not about you and it's not about them - it's a condition and hopefully they can recover from it.

'Seek as much professional advice as possible and try and find out what they've got an interest in. Jamie was lucky to find her area in health and exercise but everyone is different.'

Martin has been taking part in a gruelling physical endurance challenge each week throughout 2014

Martin said he feels strongly about the cause as he knows how heartbreaking it is to watch someone close struggle with depression or anxiety

CEO Georgie Harman said beyondblue is grateful to Martin for taking on a massive challenge to support its work.

'For most of us, completing one endurance event in a year, such as a marathon, would be a major accomplishment. To do one every week for a year is nothing short of remarkable,' she said.

'At least one in seven women will experience postnatal depression, and anxiety conditions are thought to be at least as common as depression during this time. 

'By speaking openly about anxiety and depression, particularly postnatal depression and how it affects families, Brendon has been helping to break down the stigma surrounding these conditions, which stops many people from taking action when they are struggling.

'We wish Brendon the very best for the remaining weeks of 52 for Blue and hope he achieves his goal and takes a well-earned rest.'
