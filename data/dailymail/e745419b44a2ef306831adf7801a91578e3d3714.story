A hairdresser has claimed the makers of violent video game Grant Theft Auto V stole the name and look of his barber's shop.

Anthony Braddon, 55, says the ‘Herr Kutz’ salon in the computer game is an exact replica of his family-run business.

Mr Braddon, who runs Herr Kutz barbers in Plymouth, Devon, says the shop in the game has the same name, windows, frontage, interior and sign as his own shop.

He says he consulted lawyers over alleged trademark infringement - but was told they could not do anything.

Mr Braddon, an organist at his local church, doesn’t play the game himself but his three grown-up sons showed him the game on their Xbox.

He says he was shocked to see its 'disgusting' content and fears the association could damage his salon, which he has run with wife Sarah, 56, for 32 years.

Mr Braddon is convinced one of the game’s creators - Scottish-based Rockstar North - must have seen or used his shop and decided to replicate it.

He said: 'I had a business partner who
 is sadly dead now and he had some German connections. Between us we 
invented the name Herr Kutz 32 years ago - it’s a play on words.

Mr Braddon said he was 'particularly disgusted' by the violent content of the game, which has sold more than 3.6million copies in the UK alone

'I
 had a few phone calls from people who had played the game so I went on 
myself to look at it. I have three grown up sons, they showed me the 
game on the Xbox.

'It is exactly the same, the way the logo is written, the same font, the same everything. They have clearly seen the name and thought "Oh that’s good, we’ll pinch that".'

Mr Braddon said he was 'particularly disgusted' by the violent content of the game, which has sold more than 3.6million copies in the UK alone.

The businessman said: 'We are a family shop and this is the complete opposite of what we do.

'It’s all drug taking, car thefts, it goes against everything we stand for. I never thought in a million years that people could pinch the shop’s name.

'I have gone to the solicitors and they say there is nothing we can do about it. All somebody has to do is put a full stop behind it or change it slightly.

'I think it’s an insult and I want them to change it - but I doubt very much that will happen.'

The game allows players to go for hair cuts, buy clothes, and enter restaurants and bars around the city of Los Santos, modelled on Los Angeles.

Rockstar North are yet to comment on the accusations.
