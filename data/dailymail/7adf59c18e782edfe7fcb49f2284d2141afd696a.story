He lies joint-third on the all-time list for Tour de France stage wins with 25. He won Le Tour's best sprinter's green jersey in 2011. He is the only man to have raced first over the finish line at the Champs-Elysees four times consecutively.

But Mark Cavendish, arguably the greatest sprinter in history, has never worn the famous maillot jaune.

On Saturday, in his mother Adele's home town of Harrogate, the Manx rider will aim to cross the finish line first in a sprint finish and don the leader's yellow jersey for the very first time.

25 - Mark Cavendish (Great Britain), Andre Leducq (France)

22 - Andre Darrigade (France)

20 - Nicholas Frantz (Luxembourg)

But, 
twelve months on from his agonising loss to German Marcel Kittel in the 
2013 Tour's opening stage in Corsica, the 29-year-old must be wary.

Kittel has arrived as the new sprint sensation on the block and he does not look like relenting any time soon.

If
 you factor in Kittel's fellow German sprinter Andre Greipel, 
Norwegian paceman Alexander Kristoff and the supremely talented 
double-defending green jersey champion Peter Sagan, then you begin to 
realise how tough a task Cavendish has in front of him to remain the undisputed 'sprint king'.

But
 the British rider is thankfully not alone - he has eight team-mates 
alongside him who will attempt to deliver him safely from Leeds to a 
sprint finish in Harrogate, and then eventually on to the Champs Elysees
 in Paris.

Mark Cavendish (Great Britain)

The Manx Missile will be looking to add to his 25 Tour de France stage victories as he closes in on Eddy Merckx's record of 34.

He will hope his team - and most prominently chief lead-out rider Mark Renshaw - can deliver him to safely to the line in Harrogate on Saturday so he can get his 2014 Tour de France underway.

The 29-year-old will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey (he previously won it back in 2011) but he will need to wrestle it away from the brilliant Slovakian Peter Sagan.

Tony Martin (Germany)

Martin is a time-trial specialist and is a three-time world champion in this discipline.

The 29-year-old has also won two Tour stages (in 2011 and 2013) and will be looking to add to that during Stage 20's time trial.

Martin could control the pace of the peloton with his strong cycling but he will fade in the mountains alongside Cavendish.

Specialist: German Tony Martin is a world time-trial champion and a key member of the team

Mark Renshaw (Australia)

The Australian is Cavendish right-hand man and has been his main lead-out rider at two different teams.

Renshaw first partnered Cavendish at Team Columbia-High Road between 2008 and 2011 before Cavendish joined Omega last year.

Cavendish trusts the 31-year-old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in Harrogate on Saturday.

Niki Terpstra (Holland)

The 30-year-old Dutchman won the Paris-Roubaix classic earlier this year and he is an outside bet to claim a stage victory this year if he can form a breakaway.

Michal Kwiatkowski (Poland)

Kwiatkowski is a bit of an all-rounder - he is strong at climbing, is a competent sprinter and an ex-junior world champion time-trialist.

The 29-year-old will help Cavendish out by attempting to control the pace on sprint stages but he could be let loose in the mountains to chase personal glory.

Matteo Trentin (Italy)

Omega are littered with potential stage winners and 24-year-old Trentin will hope to add to his solitary Tour victory last season.

Trentin rushed away from the peloton to win in a sprint finish on Stage 14 in 2013 and he could repeat that feat in a long, drawn-out stage this year.

Talented: Belgian Jan Bakelants is the only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey

Jan Bakelants (Belgium)

The only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey, Bakelants claimed the maillot jaune when he won stage two in 2013.

Bakelants, 28, has just joined the team this season from RadioShack-Leopard and he will be expected to do some of Cavendish's grunt work to help him don the famous jersey this time around.

Michal Golas (Poland)

Golas is a domestique everyone would love to have in their team and the 30-year-old will cycle himself into the ground to deliver Cavendish, Kwiatkowski or Trentin to stage victories.

Experienced: Italian Alessandro Petacchi has won the points jerseys at all three Grand Tours

Alessandro Petacchi (Italy)

Petacchi is the veteran of the team at 40 years of age but he is a specialist sprinter like Cavendish who has an impressive six individual stage victories to his name - as well as being the 2010 green jersey winner.

He has a chequered past having been banned for doping in 2007, but he has won 48 Grand Tour stages and the points jersey in the Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a Espana and the Tour.

Petacchi gave up his role as lead sprinter last year and left Lampre-Merida for Omega, where he now performs a role as part of the lead-out team for Cavendish. He will be key alongside Renshaw if Cavendish is to claim stage wins.

The Manx Missile rides for the Belgian 
Omega Pharma-Quick Step team, whose title sponsors are both a 
pharmaceutical company and manufacturers of laminate flooring.

His
 team contains four other riders with Tour stage victories under their 
belt - including world time-trial champion Tony Martin - as well as his 
most trusted lieutenant.

Australian Mark Renshaw is Cavendish's right-hand man and he has been the Manx cyclist's main lead-out rider at two different teams.

Renshaw first partnered Cavendish at Team Columbia-High Road between 2008 and 2011 before the Manxman joined Omega last year.

Cavendish
 trusts the 31-year-old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final 
bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in Harrogate on Saturday.

When asked about competing in Harrogate, Cavendish said: 'To think the first stage is in Yorkshire and finishes in my mother's home town - it's really exciting.

'But there are 200 bike riders on the start line almost and every one of those would like to win the yellow jersey.

'It just so happens the media attention is around me because my mum is from Harrogate.

'I remember being here in Harrogate many summers. My grandparents, my uncle still lives here.

'It's nice to look around the places I knew when I was young.'

One
 thing is for certain, it is not just Cavendish from Omega Pharma-Quick 
Step who wants him to cross that finish line first - there are eight other 
men who will give everything for the Brit's cause.

And,
 if they can deliver once more, then Cavendish will finally get his 
dream of wearing that famous yellow jersey in his mother's home town.
