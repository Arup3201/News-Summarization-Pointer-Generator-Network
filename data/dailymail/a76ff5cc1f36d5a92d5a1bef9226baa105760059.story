A six-year-old boy was on his way to his martial arts class when he was hit by an oncoming car in Sydney.

The boy was struck in Hurstville, Sydney's south, on Monday afternoon but tragically died in hospital.

It is believed he was with his aunt when he broke free from her and ran across the road.

The boy, who's name has not been released, suffered from severe head and chest injuries when paramedics were called to the scene about 4.40pm.

He was flung metres into the air when he was struck by the car - just outside the the Boy Scout Club in Hurstville which is where he attended his tae kwon do classes, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The female driver stopped after the crash underwent mandatory testing.

Speed and alcohol were not factors in the accident, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Traffic and Highway Patrol Commandâ€™s Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said the tragedy was heartbreaking.

'The impact of a crash on everyone who is linked to it resonates well after headlines have faded,' he said.

'After a series of similar events earlier in the year, I would hope anyone with children in their lives would use this an opportunity to talk about road safety with them.'

Acting Assistant Commissioner Smith urged parents and caretakers to take extra precautions when near vehicles.

'As a parent, I would plead with everyone that if they are with young children near a roadway always keep holding their hand,' he said.

'To drivers, particularly if you are passing residential areas, do be mindful children may be about.'
