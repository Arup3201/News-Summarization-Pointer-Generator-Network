A judge has ruled today that controversial bite mark evidence can be used in a New York murder trial, disappointing critics of the technique, who have called it a 'victory for the flat Earth society'.

Evidence from bite marks on victims' bodies has helped trap notorious rapists and killers, including Ted Bundy, but at least 24 men have had convictions overturned since 2000 because of flaws in the forensic method.

In the trial of murder suspect Clarence Brian Dean, Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley said today that bite analysis does meet the standards of evidence in New York law.

The forensic technique involves comparing bite marks left on the flesh of victims with the teeth of suspects.

But, in the past 13 years, several convicts have been exonerated, some after spending more than a decade in prison or on death row, according to an AP study and findings by the Innocence Project, which helps wrongfully convicted inmates win freedom through DNA testing.

The AP analysis is the most comprehensive count to date of those exonerated after being convicted or charged based partially or entirely on bite mark evidence.

In allowing bite mark analysis in his courtroom, Justice Wiley declined to spell out his reasoning, but said it met New York law guidelines and was 'obviously a field that has not been looked at closely by the courts in a long time'.

Chris Fabricant, director at the Innocence Project, was at Thursday's hearing and said the judge's decision was 'contrary to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community'.

'It's a victory for the flat Earth society,' he said.

The Innocence Project and other defense attorneys slam bite mark analysis as sham science and argue that it should no longer be allowed in courtrooms.

Many forensic dentists defend the practice as useful, especially when trying to eliminate suspects, and say it has helped convict murderers and rapists, most famously serial killer Ted Bundy.

In the New York trial of Dean, the 41-year-old is accused of killing 33-year-old Kristine Yitref, whose beaten and strangled body was found wrapped in garbage bags under a bed in a hotel near Times Square in 2007.

A forensic dentist concluded that a mark on her body matched the teeth of Dean, a fugitive sex offender from Alabama.

Dean told police he killed Miss Yitref in self-defense, saying she and another man attacked him in an attempted robbery after he agreed to pay her for sex. No other man was found.

His attorneys declined to comment after Thursday's hearing.

Prosecutors wanted the bite mark evidence allowed at his trial to help convince jurors of Dean's guilt. His defense attorneys wanted it barred because of past mistakes involving the practice and how powerful bite mark evidence can be to jurors, even with opposing testimony.

Dr David Senn, a San Antonio forensic dentist, testified in last year's hearings that bite mark analysis is valid when used in a closed population of suspects and that problems of the past can be blamed on individual dentists, not the science itself.

'The issue is not that bite mark analysis is invalid, but that bite mark examiners are not properly vetted,' he said.

Dr Senn added that he couldn't imagine a case today in which he would identify a biter unless 'there was other very strong corroborating evidence'.

Testifying for defense attorneys at the hearings was Dr Mary Bush, a University of Buffalo researcher who has used computer models to study bite marks made on bodies using a vice grip and dental models.

Her research, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found human dentition is not unique and cannot be accurately transferred to skin.

Dr Bush acknowledged that a significant limitation of her research included its use of dead bodies that have been frozen and thawed, and using machinery to create bite marks - a method far from recreating a real-life bite made on a live person during an act of violence.

She testified that she did not feel bite marks should be admissible in courtrooms, but that more research in the field is needed.
