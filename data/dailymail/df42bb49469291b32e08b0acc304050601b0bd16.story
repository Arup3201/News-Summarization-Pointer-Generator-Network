College tutor Ian Jones, 45 (pictured outside an earlier court hearing), has been warned he faces jail after being found guilty of simulating sex with two students and grabbing a teenage girl's breasts

A college tutor has been warned he faces jail after being found guilty of simulating sex with two female students and grabbing another teenage girl's breasts.

Ian Jones, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, targeted the victims, aged between 16 and 21, while teaching a motor vehicle repair course at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

The 45-year-old went on trial at Warwick Crown Court accused of 18 charges of sexual assault against five girls between 2008 and 2012.

A jury took nine hours and 29 minutes to find him guilty of five of the charges by majority verdict, but cleared him of eight other charges.

The jury were discharged from considering the five remaining counts which they were unable to reach verdicts on.

Prosecutor Graeme Simpson said he wouldn't ask for a retrial on those matters, adding: 'The guilty verdicts fairly reflect his conduct.'

During the trial, the jury heard how Jones was arrested in 2012 following an incident in which he approached a student at the college.

Mr Simpson told the court: 'He walked up to her and put his hand into her coat pocket and moved his hand and touched the crotch of her jeans.

'She asked what he was doing, and he said he was looking for fags.

'Then when she bent over to pick up her bag, he put his hands on her breasts and tried to pull her backwards.'

The court heard the victim, who was left crying and shaking, organised a meeting with the college's safeguarding team where she disclosed what had happened.

Another female pupil then came forward and described how Jones had simulated sex with her by approaching her from behind and pushing her so she was bending over.

There was also an incident when the tutor grabbed her thong as she walked past him, pulling it up with some force and commenting: 'Oh, you've got green knickers on.'

Giving evidence, Jones claimed the victim was dominated by the first girl and suggested she had made a complaint to support her.

The jury heard three other young women then came forward and Jones was convicted of an offence against one of them.

She said Jones had made comments about her breasts and had referred to them as 'a couple of airbags'.

He also pushed her over a table from behind before 'pressing his groin against her backside' and smacking her with a ruler.

Mr Simpson said: 'The nature of the allegations is what one might call bullying, abusing his position of trust, but in each case it was overtly sexual.'

Jones was warned he faces jail at Warwick Crown Court (above) and was bailed until sentencing next month. The judge ordered him to sign the sex offenders' register and said his 'dangerousness' should be assessed

Adjourning the case for sentencing next month, Judge Alan Parker said: 'I have got to say that the report should assess dangerousness.

'I do not have the view that Mr Jones is remotely dangerous, but it seems to me it would be wrong whenever anyone is convicted of an offence under the Sexual Offences Act not to ask for consideration of that aspect.'

Jones, who was ordered to register as a sex offender, was granted bail but was warned he faces jail.

Judge Parker told him: 'It must not be taken as an indication of what I'm going to do, I have an open mind.'

Jones is due to be sentenced next month.
