Chris and Gabby Adcock claimed Commonwealth Games gold for England with a convincing victory over Chris Langridge and Heather Olver in the mixed doubles final.

The husband-and-wife duo, ranked five in the world, lived up to their top-seed billing as they powered to a 21-9 21-12 win over their international team-mates at the Emirates Arena.

The Adcocks did not relinquish their grip after imposing themselves on the second seeds early in the first game and they went on to wrap up victory in 35 minutes.

Family affair: Chris and Gabby Adcock won gold in the badminton mixed doubles finals on Sunday morning

Golden couple: Husband and wife Adcocks won in straight sets 21-9 21-12 at the Emirates Arena

The Adcocks' victory capped a superb tournament in which they were hardly troubled and did not drop a single game.

The most points they conceded in any one game in their five matches was 17.

For Gabby Adcock the gold added to the bronze she won in the women's doubles with Lauren Smith while both she and Chris were part of the silver-medalling England side in the team event.

Langridge and Olver, although completely outplayed, could also reflect on a good Games. Both had a hand in the team success while Langridge will also go home with a bronze medal from the men's doubles.

The future of Langridge and Olver as a partnership is uncertain as Badminton England consider a reshuffle ahead of the 2016 Olympics.

Team to beat: The Adcocks didn't drop a single game in the whole tournament on their way to gold

The Adcocks are certain to spearhead the British drive for Rio in mixed doubles, with their success in Glasgow considerably enhancing their reputation even though it was a non-ranking event.

Chris, 25, and Gabby, 23, who were married last year, have made strong progress since being restored as an on-court partnership after London 2012. Chris had played at the Olympics with Scotland's Imogen Bankier.

Their dominance of the Commonwealth Games competition was underlined in a one-sided final in which Langridge and Olver never won more than two points in succession.

Gabby Adcock said: 'We're over the moon with this gold. There was a lot of pressure coming into this tournament, being number one seeds, but we played so well this week.

'We kept our calm, tried to enjoy it. We are exhausted now but we couldn't be happier.'

The badminton competitions have spanned the length of the Games and the players are now looking forward to returning home to Milton Keynes to rest and see their Maltese dog, Bowser.

Chris Adcock said: 'It was pretty much a perfect game today and to do that on this stage was pretty special.

'We are definitely looking forward to getting home and being able to chill for a few days and reflect on a fantastic couple of weeks.

'But the first thing we want to do is pick up the dog. We've missed him like crazy.'
