A British mum critically injured in a quad bike crash in Ibiza has died in hospital.

Holidaymaker Lisa Darlington, 45, lost her fight for life after a week in intensive care.

Her son Danny, 21, has been arrested for allegedly driving the vehicle without a licence.

Crash: Lisa Darlington, 45, was injured in an accident on a road near Cala Llonga, a popular beach resort on Ibiza's south east coast, at around 9pm last Thursday

The accident happened on September 13 on a road near Cala Llonga, a beach resort on the Spanish island's south east coast.

Police said Ms Darlington was a passenger on the quad being driven by her son, who lost control and smashed into a stone wall at around 8pm.

Ms Darlington suffered serious head injuries and was rushed by ambulance to the Our Lady of Rosario hospital where she underwent emergency surgery.

Doctors kept her in a drug-induced coma and she could only breath with the help of a machine.

She died in the hospital yesterday/on Wednesday morning.

Danny had allegedly rented the quad bike using a provisional UK driving licence, when a full licence is required to drive the vehicle on a road.

He was arrested and appeared before an investigating magistrate, who released him on bail.

He went straight from court to be at his mother's bedside.

He has not been charged with any offence and the magistrate will decide at a later date whether he should face charges.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national on 19 September in Ibiza. We continue to provoke consular assistance to the family.

'We are aware of the arrest of a British national on 14 September and we are providing consular assistance.'

The accident was the fourth in Ibiza involving a quad bike this month and the sixth since June.

On September 9 a British couple, aged 64 and 52, were run down by a quad bike in the party town of San Antonio.

They were struck as they crossed a busy road at a crossing point at 3pm.The 52-year-old woman suffered multiple injuries while both the man's legs were injured.

And in July a French woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries after falling from a quad near Cala Jondal.
