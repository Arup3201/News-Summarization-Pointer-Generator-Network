DJ Edith Bowman has hit out at the trend for 'ridiculous' designer clothes for children.

The former Radio 1 star, who has two young boys, also disapproved of mothers who dress siblings in the same outfits and said that people were too quick to judge women on breastfeeding and Caesarean sections.

She voiced her opinions on Radio 5 Live's series on pregnancy and birth that is presented by her former Radio 1 co-host Colin Murray.

When asked by Murray: 'Do you dress your kids in designer clothes? I hate that', Bowman, 39, replied: 'Agreed. Also, dressing siblings in the same clothes. Let them have their own identity.'

She added: 'When I think of designer clothes, though, I think of those really awful 'almost adult' clothes for kids, like suit jackets and leopard-print head bands.'

When Murray recalled seeing a toddler in Armani shoes, she replied: 'Ridiculous. It's nice to treat yourself now and again, but you have to remember they'll grow out of them so quickly.

'My brother is about to have a baby girl and my mum and I went to have a look at a shop in north London that does sell the most gorgeous, but expensive, kids' clothes. Mum looked at this amazing little dress for a baby girl - it was £300! It would probably fit her for a month.'

Promoting individuality: The DJ is a mother-of-two but won't be dressing her two sons in the same clothes

Bowman, 39, has two sons, Rudy, four, and three-month-old Spike, with Editors frontman Tom Smith. She recently criticised people for being too quick to judge mothers.

'It amazes me how sometimes people can be so thoughtless when they come to give you their opinion, especially around Caesarean sections and breastfeeding,' she told the Radio Times.

'I had no choice in having two C-sections and I can't believe the lack of understanding of people who assume I have not 'put the work in' or don't have the same connection with my child that I would have had if I'd had natural birth.'

'Most natural thing in the world': Edith said she's a big believer in breastfeeding in public (posed by model)

Bowman, who hosts a show on BBC Radio 6 Music, added: 'I am a big believer in breast-feeding in public. It's the most natural thing in the world, and it's not as if I just walk about with my boobies hanging out. You can get some amazing contraptions that help you be as discreet as possible.'

She added: 'You do get some people where you can feel their uncomfortableness or disapproval - weirdly, it's mostly women, and that's a real shame. But I'm sure there is a level of intrigue there, for sure.'
