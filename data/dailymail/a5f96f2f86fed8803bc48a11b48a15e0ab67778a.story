A trusted church treasurer stole £90,000 to fund her online gambling habit, then pretended to be ill to escape justice.

Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon.

But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses.

Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer

Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets.

She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes.

Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen £90,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just £24,000.

She said £7,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and £6,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school.

In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard.

Judge Paul Darlow said:” 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.”'

He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home.

Jo Martin, defending, said: “'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.” '

She said Holding would find prison life '‘extraordinarily difficult'’ because of her ailments.

Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes.

'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said.

'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults.

“'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.”'

Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition.
