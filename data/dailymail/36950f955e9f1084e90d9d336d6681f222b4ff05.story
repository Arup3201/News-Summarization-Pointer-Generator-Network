Steve McManaman hopes that Raheem Sterling and England's youngsters can light up the World Cup - and ready themselves to target winning the tournament in 2018.

The ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder believes that the nation puts too much pressure on its players to perform at major tournaments but the squad Roy Hodgson has picked for Brazil is the right one.

He feels that Sterling, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and England's promising young stars will learn from the experience and be better prepared for challenging at major tournaments come the European Championships in France in 2016 and the World Cup in Russia in 2018.

McManaman said: ‘I hope somebody lights up the World Cup for England, and that player could be Raheem Sterling.

'He had a magnificent season for Liverpool and he has really progressed this year. He is exciting and both him and Adam Lallana can make things happen for England.

'We have several youngsters who have bags of potential but I don’t like to go overboard on a lot of the younger players because as a nation we put too much pressure on them. We always laud them up too much.'

With 37 international caps and having represented England at three major tournaments, the ex-Manchester City midfielder knows the benefit of having experience of the unique environment.

'We’ve got a lot of young players who are going to take this experience from the World Cup and it will help them in the future and I think that’s the main thing for me,' he said.

'Yes I hope they go out and light up the World Cup - I hope six of them light up the World Cup and they win it, then we can go crazy about them. But I think we all feel winning the World Cup in Brazil will be a step too far for them.

'The main thing is they go, they improve, they experience the journey, they know what tournament football’s about. Then, in two years’ time, they will be better equipped and the Euros are going to be in France, on the European continent, and they’ll perform even better then.

'Then hopefully in four years’ time, when it’s in Russia, we’ll have a real good squad of players with a huge amount of talent, a huge amount of experience, that we can take to the next level.'

McManaman was speaking at the launch of the Lucozade Sport Conditions Zone at Canary Wharf in London.

The centre aims to replicate the conditions that England's players will face in their World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus on June 14.

And the 42-year-old, who took part in five-a-side matches in 32-degree temperatures and 76 per cent humidity, explained the difficulties of playing in those conditions.

He said: ‘It is really, really difficult - to move around in those conditions for 90 minutes will be tortuous for the players. I've only played five-a-side but they have to play on a full pitch and for a lot longer.

'I think Miami will help England’s 
preparations for Manaus. England’s preparations are second to none. They’re in Miami now, it’s been hot but it still won’t 
be like Manaus - nothing will be like Manaus.

'The first day, standing on 
that pitch in front of that crowd at the World Cup, it will feel so 
different, but the preparations building for that first game so there’ll
 be no excuses.'
