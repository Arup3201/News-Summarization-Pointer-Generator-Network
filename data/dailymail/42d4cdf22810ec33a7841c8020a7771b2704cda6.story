A life-like outdoor statue of a man sleepwalking in just his underpants is causing a stir at the all-female Wellesley College, where some students have complained it's frightening.

The statue of the nearly-naked man, who has his eyes closed with his arms outstretched in zombie-like trance, is part of an exhibit by sculptor Tony Matelli at the college's Davis Museum.

But after it was placed in a busy area of the Massachusetts campus on Monday, it has prompted more than 270 students to sign an online petition at Change.org to have it taken down.

Realistic: A statue entitled 'Sleepwalker' by Tony Matelli has frightened students on the all-female Wellseley College, where many have thought it was in fact a real, semi-naked man

The statue, 'Sleepwalker', is a 'source of apprehension, fear, and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault' for many, according to a petition started by junior Zoe Magid, the Boston Globe reported.

'While it may appear humorous, or 
thought-provoking to some, it has already become a source of undue 
stress for many Wellesley College students,' the petition read.

Museum director Lisa Fischman wrote on the school website and on the petition's website that the sculpture has succeeded in its goal of provoking discussion.

'We placed the Sleepwalker on the roadside just beyond the Davis to connect the exhibition - within the museum - to the campus world beyond,' Fischman wrote. 

Strange: Some students have been scared on seeing the statue - believing it is a real near-naked man

Spooky: After student complained, the museum director said good art was supposed to provoke

'I love the idea of art escaping the museum and muddling the line between what we expect to be inside (art) and what we expect to be outside (life)."

In response, Magid told the Boston Globe that Fischman hadn't addressed their concerns.

She 'didn’t respond to the fact that it's making students on campus feel unsafe, which is not appropriate,' Magid said. 'We really feel that if a piece of art makes students feel unsafe, that steps over a line.'

Bridget Schreiner, who signed the petition, told the news site that the first time she saw the statue, she thought it was a real person on the campus.

'This could be a trigger for students who have experienced sexual assault,' she said.

Art history student Annie Wang added that while art was supposed to make people think, the statue was not appropriate in its current place.

'Wellesley is a place where we’re supposed to feel safe,' she said.
