Explosive claims: Lawrence Wilkerson (pictured), Colin Powell's former chief of staff, said Diego Garcia was used as a 'transit location' for the US government's 'nefarious activities' after 9/11

Interrogations of terror suspects took place on the British overseas territory of Diego Garcia, according to a senior official in George W Bush's administration.

Lawrence Wilkerson said 'nefarious activities' had occurred on the Indian Ocean island, which the UK leases to the US military.

And he said it was 'difficult to think' the UK authorities were unaware that detainees were being questioned.

The former White House aide's revelations will increase the pressure on David Cameron to order a public inquiry into the extent of Britain's involvement in the CIA's rendition and torture programme.

Ministers say the island was used just twice as a refuelling stop for extraordinary rendition flights – where terror suspects are moved to secret prisons for torture.

But they insist no detainees set foot on the atoll – a claim now seriously undermined by Mr Wilkerson, who was US secretary of state Colin Powell's chief of staff between 2002 and 2005.

He said he received the information about interrogations on Diego Garcia from four well-placed CIA and intelligence sources, including a veteran of the renditions programme and an official who was 'very much plugged in to what was going on at the CIA' after he retired.

It is the first time a senior Bush administration official has stated on the record that the remote British territory was a part of the CIA's global network of secret 'black site' prisons.

In an interview with Vice News, a website, he said it was known as a place to get things done 'out of the limelight'.

'No one has indicated there was a detention site there, not in so many words,' said Mr Wilkerson. 'What they indicated is that interrogations took place there.'

He said there was no permanent detention facility on the outcrop, but added: 'What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable.

'So you might have a case where you simply go in and use a facility at Diego Garcia for a month, or two weeks, or whatever, and you do your nefarious activities there.

'It's difficult for me to think that we could do anything there of any duration to speak of without the British knowing – at least the British on the island – knowing what we were doing. That doesn't mean London knew.'

The Army veteran, who served on the island during the 1980s, added: 'A general theme I heard was that the British were very cooperative with everything.'

Number 10 is already facing accusations that ministers pressed the US Senate intelligence committee to redact any reference to Diego Garcia from its damning report into torture.Lord Goldsmith, who was Tony Blair's top legal adviser, has said he has 'no recollection' of whether discussions took place over using Diego Garcia as a black site.

Manfred Nowak, the United Nations' former special envoy on torture, has said he had been told detainees were held on Diego Garcia in 2002 and 2003.

Cori Crider, a director at human rights charity Reprieve said: 'This suggests the UK Government has not told the whole truth.

'Ministers have consistently claimed only two CIA rendition victims ever landed on Diego Garcia – Lawrence Wilkerson's comments suggest that either they haven't been honest with the public, or the US government hasn't been honest with them.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The US government has assured us that, apart from the two cases in 2002, there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the UK, our overseas territories, or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 September, 2001.'

Diego Garcia is midway between East Africa and the southern tip of Asia and was leased by Britain to the United States, which turned it into a vast military base

The island is midway between East Africa and the southern tip of Asia and was leased by Britain to the U.S., which turned it into a vast military base.

Wilkerson said he thinks it's unlikely the British military personnel on Diego Garcia had not noticed the arrival and departure of prisoners. 

The UK government claims only two rendition flights have passed through the island when they stopped to refuel in 2002. 

Cori Crider, a director at London-based human rights charity Reprieve, said: 'This suggests the UK Government has not told the whole truth about Diego Garcia's part in the CIA's torture programme. 

'Ministers have consistently claimed only two CIA rendition victims ever landed on Diego Garcia – Lawrence Wilkerson's comments suggest that either they haven't been honest with the public, or the US government hasn't been honest with them.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The US government has assured us that, apart from the two cases in 2002, there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the UK, our overseas territories, or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 September, 2001.'
