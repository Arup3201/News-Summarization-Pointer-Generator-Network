As a keen bee keeper himself, he obviously has the highest standards.

Little wonder, then, that the Prince of Wales has brought out his own handcrafted hive. The sting in the tail? Its £1,250 price tag.

The ‘Top Bar Bee Hive’ is currently for sale on his Highgrove website. All profits from the range go to the Prince’s charities.

Charles has spoken passionately about the plight of the bee. In the UK, wild honey bees are nearly extinct and some species of bumblebee have been lost altogether.

Poor weather and pesticides have resulted in the death of a third of all honeybee colonies in England.

The prince supports beekeepers’ associations through The Prince’s Countryside Fund, as well as keeping bees on his Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire.

The website boasts that the  ‘Top Bar’ Bee Hive allows the insects to live in an environment which is sustainable and low-impact, more akin to their natural environment.

Made from FSC cedar and larch in Gloucestershire, the design allows bees to form a natural comb.

The hive has a base trough filled with ‘natural woodland material’ creating an enclosed natural ecosystem allowing beneficial insects to live in harmony with the bees.

The hinged roof also allows easy access and maintenance and observation windows allow monitoring of the activity and progress of the creatures inside.

Each bee hive is completely bespoke and takes between 8-12 weeks to be produced. It is painted in the Highgrove duck-egg blue colours.

The hive isn’t the only luxury animal home the prince has created, however.

He also sold a hen house – also for charity - costing an eye-watering £3,750.

There was even was a £95 house for hibernating hedgehogs, inspired by the garden furniture at his country home.
