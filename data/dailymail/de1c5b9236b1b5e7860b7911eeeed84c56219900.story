A mother feared she'd never find love again as she suffered from an undiagnosed condition which meant she couldn't stay awake long enough to enjoy a date.

Sadie Jones's illness was as dangerous as it was embarrassing as she could unexpectedly nod off at any moment.

The 39-year-old from Devon had been known to snooze in shops, next to loud speakers - and even standing up cutting someone's hair.

Something I said? Sadie Jones, with partner Nick Threadgold, kept falling asleep in embarrassing situations like on dates

Then when she separated from the father of her two sons and daughter, she feared she would never find love again due to her constant need for a quick nap.

She said: 'I went on a date to a 
restaurant but within minutes, even before ordering my meal, I had 
fallen straight to sleep. It was so embarrassing and awful for him - he 
must have thought I found him so boring.

'On
 other occasions I've been known to fall asleep as soon as we got to the
 bar. If only I'd known I had narcolepsy all those years ago.'

After 20 years of suffering, Sadie was finally told she had narcolepsy - which causes people to fall asleep multiple times a day without warning.

Now Sadie is finally being treated and has been able to stay awake long enough to form a happy relationship with partner Nick Threadgold.

Diagnosis at last: After 20 years of suffering, Sadie, 39, was finally told she had narcolepsy

Nick, 39, was understanding after her diagnosis earlier this year and the pair's relationship has gone from strength to strength.

Sadie said: 'Since I've started my medication we've been able to talk in the car, before I would just fall straight to sleep.

'Before he was always so bored, waiting for me to wake up, but now we can finally spend quality time together.'

'I couldn't even take a bath, as I could have fallen asleep and drowned'

Nick said: 'Now that Sadie is on medication it has greatly improved our relationship.

'She is able to keep going during the day and we can actually have conversations when she's comfortable as normally she'd be straight asleep.'

She's been known to snooze next to club speakers, in taxis, at the bus stop and even in shops.

Sadie said: 'I was doing a computer course at college but I had to quit because I would always fall asleep and it was really embarrassing.

New love: Nick, 39, was understanding and after her diagnosis, the pair's relationship has gone from strength to strength

'I hadn't been diagnosed with narcolepsy so people didn't really have much sympathy.'

Sadie, who would fall to sleep up to four times a day and for up to two hours a time never let her â€˜unknown' condition control her future.

She said: 'I had always wanted to become a hairdresser and despite falling asleep all the time I was determined to not let it dominate my life.

Now I've been diagnosed with narcolepsy I can start doing more with my children during the day without always falling asleep

'I was cutting someone's hair one day and completely fell asleep while standing.

'It was embarrassing really as people would just resume I was really lazy.

'I couldn't even take a bath, as I could easily have fallen asleep and drowned.'

But this year Sadie finally found the answers she was looking for following a sleep study and lumbar puncture (a medical procedure where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine, in order to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain).

She said: 'I just don't understand why it took so long to diagnose Narcolepsy when I knew myself I had it for 20-years and I'm not a doctor.'

One of Sadie's friends who were diagnosed decades before her would often comment on how her sleeping pattern was similar to that of herself.

Moving on with their lives: Sadie finally found the answers she was looking for following a sleep study and lumbar puncture

Sadie's final diagnosis was given this year after a 20-year wait.

Sadie said: 'Now I've been diagnosed with narcolepsy I can start doing more with my children during the day without always falling asleep. I can finally look forward to sleep-free days.'

The condition is a rare sleep disorder affecting around 31,000 people in the UK.

Nicola Rule, Treasurer of Narcolepsy UK said: 'So few people know about this medical condition, it is a very complex and chronic illness that won't disappear.

'So many narcolepsy sufferers wait a long time to be diagnosed as many GPs are not fully aware of this neurological condition.

'Our charity aims to raise more awareness so people can be diagnosed quicker.'
