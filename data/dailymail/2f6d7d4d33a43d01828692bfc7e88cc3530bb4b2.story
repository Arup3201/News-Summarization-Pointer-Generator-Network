Philadelphia locals are furious after a local radio station's weekend concert ended with intoxicated youth peeing and publicly having sex on people's private property and in front of innocent children.

Residents from the Philadelphia neighborhood Northern Liberties said that Radio 104.5's summer block party at the outdoor plaza called Piazza at Schmidts didn't have enough security guards or portable toilets.

Music fans who didn't want to wait in a long line to use the bathroom decided that the world was their public toilet and so they peed on the street and in people's backyards.

Drunk concert attendees were caught having sex on people's private property and carried on for 40 minutes despite people yelling for them to stop

The Daily News spoke to resident Sibyl Lindsay, 35, who has lived in Northern Liberties for four years and decided to leave the concert early after her children were forced to witness two teenagers having sex and other teenagers peeing in public.

'I get that people pee in public. But hundreds of people peeing on your property, on your house, in front of your children?' Lindsay told the Daily News.

'Girls were just dropping their pants and peeing all over our property,' she said.

'It wasn't five, it wasn't ten â€” it was hundreds of people.'

Lindsay claimed that there were only 8 to 10 portable toilets for hundreds of drunk party goers. She blames the radio station and the plaza for not securing the event.

Lindsay's neighbor was able to film two people having sex behind condos near the plaza.

With only a limited numbers of portable toilets, drunk teenagers took to peeing all over people's cars and in their backyards

According to witnesses they carried on drunkenly for over 40 minutes despite people yelling for them to stop.

'You can see my kids' castle in our yard while they were doing this,' Lindsay said.

The company that owns the radio station, Clear Channel, apologized for the messy outcome of their weekend event.

'We apologize for any of our fans who may have had a less than enjoyable experience at this past weekend's block party,' said Clear Channle to NBC.

'As these shows have become more popular and larger, we've worked with our partners at the Piazza to have them increase security and facilities.'

There are generally security and sanitation requirements at large events and Westminsiter Management who owns the plaza said that the radio station. 'didn't follow the requirements and standards for public events.'

The next event won't take place at the plaza but will be at a waterfront venue called Penn's Landing a mile away.

Lindsay along with other neighbors have asked that cleanup crews help them with their yards but she has yet to hear back.

Residents also want answers as to why there were not enough police officers sent to manage the crazy scene.

'I don't care where they go, they shouldn't be in the center of any community in Philadelphia,' she said. 'They should be in a proper venue.'
