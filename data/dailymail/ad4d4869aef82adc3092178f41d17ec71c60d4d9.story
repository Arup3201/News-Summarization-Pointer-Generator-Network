It’s been a tough few weeks privately for Lindsey Vonn and she was under huge pressure on home snow. So she had every right to celebrate her first World Cup win on a U.S. slope by striking a pose.

The recently-divorced Colorado skier decided to celebrate her landmark victory by dropping to a knee with her skis in her hand and taking up a prayer pose. It's otherwise known as ‘Tebowing’.

Vonn, 27, has joined the craze that mimics quarterback Tim Tebow of NFL team Denver Broncos - and she had asked his brother beforehand if it would be OK to pull off the pose if she won.

The champion skier’s hometown fans were packed tightly into the stands and some of the local children had even been excused from school to take it all in. She didn’t disappoint them.

Some fans had wondered how she would do without her husband, Thomas Vonn, who served as an adviser and personal coach. But her family, friends, coaches and teammates have stepped in.

The Olympic gold medalist skier confirmed last month the couple started divorce proceedings after more than four years of marriage, and her husband would no longer have a role as her chief advisor.

Vonn, of Vail, Colorado, finished in 1 minute, 10.68 seconds, holding off the Swiss Fabienne Suter by 0.37 seconds and Anna Fenninger of Austria, who came third on the tricky Birds of Prey course.

‘I still don't believe it, really,’ said Vonn, who has now won a U.S.-record four straight Alpine races. ‘Getting a chance to win at home, with a home crowd here, it's just more than I could've expected.’

'I said that if I won in Colorado, or at home, that I would do it. Go Broncos. I did it. Got to represent'

While Vonn's 46th World Cup win moved her into a tie with Austria's Renate Goetschl for third on the career list, she will remember this victory more for finally breaking through in Colorado.

Before stepping on the top step of the podium at the post-race ceremony, she dropped to a knee with her skis in her hand and joined the ‘Tebowing’ craze.

But out of respect for Tebow she asked his brother, who was at the race, if it would be disrespectful. She was given the green light. The two have recently struck up a friendship but deny dating.

‘I said that if I won in Colorado, or at home, that I would do it,’ said Vonn, who befriended Tim Tebow at a charity golf tournament over the off-season. ‘Go Broncos. I did it. Got to represent.’

'This is my first ski race. It was awesome. I told her I’m her good luck charm, because this is the first time she’s won in America'

Robby Tebow

‘This is my first ski race,’ Robby Tebow told the Denver Post. ‘It was awesome. I told her I’m her good luck charm, because this is the first time she’s won in America.’

Vonn won the best female athlete category at the ESPY Awards this summer in in Los Angeles, California, mixing with the likes of Tim Tebow and singer Justin Bieber.
