A Delaware pediatrician who researches near-death experiences involving children may have been experimenting on his 11-year-old stepdaughter by waterboarding her, police said in court documents.

The possible link between Dr. Melvin Morse's research and the waterboarding allegations was revealed in an affidavit for a search warrant for Morse's computers.

According to the affidavit, Dr. Melvin Morse brought the girl 'to a possible near death state from the simulation of drowning.'

'This waterboarding that he has performed ... would fall into the area of study he practices,' police said in the affidavit.

'It is logical that he has therefore written about and/or researched the topic of waterboarding.'

Joe Hurley, an attorney for Morse, 
said the idea that Morse was experimenting on his own daughter is 'the 
sheerest of speculation.'

Morse, who faces a preliminary hearing
Thursday on felony child endangerment and conspiracy charges, has 
authored several books and articles on paranormal science and near-death
experiences.

He has appeared on Larry King Live and
The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss his research on out-of-body 
experiences. His website is strewn with commentary about God, love, 
family and death.

Morse told AP in a telephone interview
Monday that the charges against him are an overreaction from 
authorities who were criticized in the wake of a child sex abuse scandal
involving another pediatrician.

Morse said he is the victim of 
'post-Bradley hysteria,' a reference to pediatrician Earl Bradley, who 
was convicted a year ago and is serving 14 life sentences for sexually 
abusing scores of his young patients over more than a decade.

Following Bradley's arrest in December
2009, state officials ordered investigations into how he was allowed to
continue practicing medicine for years despite suspicions that he was 
molesting his patients.

Lawmakers passed several new laws 
toughening requirements for police, health care workers and others to 
report suspected child abuse.

The allegations of waterboarding came 
after Morse was accused of grabbing his 11-year-old stepdaughter by the 
ankle in July and, as her 6-year-old sister watched, dragging her across
a gravel driveway.

He was arrested July 13 on misdemeanor endangerment and assault charges and released on bail.

When the older girl was interviewed 
last week, she told investigators that her father disciplined her by 
holding her face under a running faucet at least four times since 2009, a
punishment that she said her father called 'waterboarding.'

Waterboarding simulates drowning and 
it has been used in the past by U.S. interrogators on terrorism 
suspects. Many critics call it torture.

State police said the girl's mother, 
Pauline Morse, witnessed some of the waterboarding but did not stop it. 
She is also out on bail.

Melvin and Pauline Morse were both charged with felony child endangerment and conspiracy.

'All of these things are very absurd, except that Delaware has really had the trauma (of Bradley),' Morse told the AP.

Morse, 58, ended the interview before he could be asked directly about the waterboarding allegations.

Mr Hurley, the attorney for Morse, has raised doubts about the girl's claims.

He has described the waterboarding 
description as an 'attention-getter' by authorities, based on an 
allegation from an 11-year-old who he said had made a false abuse claim 
against a family member before.

'Cruel': Morse is a pediatrician and has co-authored books on near-death experiences in children

Frightening: The girl told social workers that her father, left, said she could last for five minutes under the water without getting brain damage. Her mother Pauline, right, has been released on bail

'I have no doubt but that the Bradley 
phenomenon has its fingerprints all over the sensationalization of this 
situation,' Mr Hurley said.

State officials suspended Morse's medical license after his arrest last week.

Morse, who was released from custody 
Friday after posting $14,500 secured bail, claimed he was 'the first 
doctor to blow the whistle on Earl Bradley.'

Morse said he warned state officials 
in 2007 that Bradley was using saline solution to give fake vaccines to 
his patients, though state officials said they never received a report 
from Morse until after Bradley was arrested in 2009.

'I reported that, and I'm the only 
Delaware physician who had the courage to testify for the Bradley 
victims,' said Morse, claiming that he gave a deposition in the Bradley 
case.
