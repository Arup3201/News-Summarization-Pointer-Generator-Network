Hippos are not usually known for their subtlety but this hulking beast appears to be using stealth techniques while he sets his sights on his prey.

The large mammal submerged itself before seemingly gliding gracefully head first out of the water.

For a moment, its large head appeared camouflaged in the brown water and even looked more like a stalking crocodile than a cumbersome hippo.

Making a wake: The hippo glides through the water, its head just above the surface, as a small wake forms on either side of it at the Chobe National Park in Botswana

Coming up: The surface of the water begins to bubble-up as the hippo spots a boat full of tourists and decides to take a closer look

In the event, its 'prey' was a nearby boat full of sight-seers which quickly made off when the skipper finally spotted the creature from the deep.

Tourist Deena Sveinsson, a commercial airline pilot, had her camera at hand and managed to capture the moment which happened on the Chobe River in the Chobe National Park in Botswana.

Deena, from Colorado, said there was about 30 hippos around in the water about 7am and all but one were busy either playing with each other or sleeping.

Ms Sveinsson said: 'Although we were not very close this particular hippo felt we were and began chasing our boat.

Eerily close: The hippo's ears can be seen just above the water line as it proceeds towards the boat while about 30 other hippos amuse themselves nearby

Breaking mad: The hippo appears out of the water, but not before the tourist boat driver guided his vessel and his passengers well out of harms way

'Sensing this our driver drove the boat away as fast as he could as death by hippo is the number one cause of death in the African Wild.

'Nobody else on the boat caught on that we were being chased and I happened to turn around quickly to see it and snapped these photos.'

When she looked over the pictures Ms Sveinsson said she was surprised at how graceful the hippo looked.

She said: 'I realised that the one of him looking very graceful in the water was very special as it showed hippos in a different way, one that was not yawning or spitting.'
