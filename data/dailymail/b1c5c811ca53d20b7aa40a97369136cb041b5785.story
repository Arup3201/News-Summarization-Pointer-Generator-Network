Lindsay Lohan is trying to use time on stage in London as part of community service for reckless driving, a lawyer will claim today.

Prosecutor Terry White will tell a judge that the actress is attempting to claim credit for the time she spent performing in the West End production Speed The Plow last year. 

The 28-year-old had been ordered to carry out 240 hours of court-ordered community service, which she vowed to complete at the London-based charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV).

But according to tmz, Mr White has examined the hours she spent at the organisation and will tell a judge she violated her probation.

He will claim that on one day the actress was given six hours credit but that two of those hours were for a matinee performance of Speed The Plow, a further two were for an evening performance while two more hours were taken up with a meet-and-greet event afterwards.

The lawyer will also point to a day when Miss Lohan was said to have completed community service between 11am and 3pm. 

According to Tmz he will say that a performance of the play started at 3pm on that day and that she would have been required to be at the theatre - six miles away from the CSV building - 35 minutes early.

The actress faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service she received for reckless driving after her Porsche collided with a truck in 2012.

Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, the movie business satire Speed The Plow. 

She played a forthright secretary in the production at London's Playhouse Theatre.

Mr White told The Mail on Sunday that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for Miss Lohan if she is found in breach of her probation terms.

Tmz says it has tried to contact the Hollywood star's lawyer, Shawn Holley, but has yet to receive a response. 

On Sunday, CSV chief executive Oonagh Aitken said the organisation took its 'responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness.'
