The Duchess of Cambridge last night cheekily recalled the infamous moment she caught Prince William's eye in a see through dress at a university fashion show.

Chatting at a reception with a pretty current female undergraduate at St Andrews University, Kate gave her a knowing glance and asked: 'I hope you weren't involved in the fashion show, you never know what you are going to be asked to wear!'

The Duchess and her husband were at a fund-raising dinner held by St Andrews University, the college where they met for the first time in 2001 and, subsequently, fell in love.

The University has launched a £100 
million 600th anniversary fundraising appeal to offer bursaries to 
bright students who would otherwise not be able to afford to study at a 
leading university.

Last night's dinner was held in the historic Middle Temple Inn in the heart of legal London.

Kate, 30, wore a sexy black and nude 
lace dress by designer Alice Temperley that she previously wore to the 
premiere of War Horse.

Kate's hot! The future Duchess of Cambridge strides down the catwalk aged 19 at a St Andrew's University fashion show in a transparent lace dress in 2002. Prince William was in the audience and apparently whispered to a friend 'Kate's hot!'

Pinned onto it was a crystal red poppy given to her by the Royal British Legion.

At a pre dinner drinks reception she and William chatted with huge fondness about their university days.

The prince spoke of his 'happy, happy 
memories' and described Kate, with whom he studied history of art, as 
his 'art guru' - 'she was much better at it than me,' he said.

He also chatted with one of the 
guests, Adrienne Kimball, about how much he and his wife loved their 
engagement portrait by Mario Testino.

'If we had asked for that picture 
of us hugging we wouldn't have got it. It was just very natural and 
summed up how unbelievably happy we were,' he said.

Kate spoke about her regret at not 
learning to play golf while she was there and recalled being made to 
dress up as a baby complete with a bib for the Raisin Weekend, the 
university's version of rag week.

'I think there is a photo of it out there somewhere,' she told Amanda Bradley.

Mrs Bradley said: 'She clearly loved 
her time at St Andrews and it was obvious the way she and William spoke 
about each other that they are absolutely besotted with each other.'

William launched and became patron of 
the university's appeal when the couple visited the university in the 
run up to their wedding.

Among the guests present tonight
were some of those who have already benefited from such financial help 
as well as supporters and former alumni.

The couple walked into the Inn's Hall 
with a piper ahead of them, before taking their seats in the opulent 
Elizabethan banqueting suite.

The university's Principle, Sir Menzies Campbell, sat next to the Duchess at dinner.

The menu included spiced poached pear 
with roquefort, crown of partridge and rhubarb and ginger crumble washed
 down with a Middle Temple Claret 2009 and, appropriately, a University 
of St Andrews Bruichladdich single malt. In a short address, Prince William 
said his time at university evoked 'the happiest of memories, of cold 
winters and good friends.'

Post dinner entertainment was provided by a student a capella Group called The Other Guys.

Founded in the 15th Century, St Andrews is Scotland’s ‘first’ university and the third-oldest in the English speaking world.

William and Kate both graduated in 2005 with 2:1 honours degrees.

The Duke studied Art History, Social 
Anthropology and Geography before switching at the end of his second 
year to straight Geography, while his future wife initially studied Art 
History, Social Anthropology and Classics before specialising in Art 
History.

Reminiscing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge happily recalled their own days at St Andrews during the gala

Good cause: The reception and dinner was held to launch a £100million fundraising appeal to help offer bursaries to bright students who couldn't afford to study there

Coined ‘Britain's top match-making 
university’, it  has a reputation for students meeting their future 
husband or wife. As many as one in 10 students marry a fellow graduate 
from St. Andrews.

William and Kate had a number of 
history of art and anthropology classes together in their first year, as
 well as living close by in the same halls of residence, St Salvator’s.

At the time, however, Kate was dating a
 fourth-year student, Rupert Finch, while William had his own on-off 
romance with a girl back home to keep him occupied.

Legend has it, however, that the 
prince suddenly realised the girl of his dreams had been in front of his
 nose the whole time when in March 2002 he saw Kate strut down the 
catwalk at a charity fashion show in a see-through dress and stutter: 
‘Wow, Kate’s hot.’

Smart and sophisticated couple: The Duke looked smart in a traditional dinner suit alongside Kate

Respect: Kate showed her support of the military with a sparkling red poppy. William is a serving officer in the RAF

The see through dress she wore sold at auction last year for a staggering £65,000.

The pair shared a house for the rest 
of their time at university and, somewhere along the way, friendship 
blossomed into romance…..and then into the history books.

In his speech William said: 'Tonight 
is very special for Catherine and me.

'It brings together two 
institutions that are dear to us: our alma mater, St Andrews University,
 and Middle Temple, our hosts here tonight. Both are world-renowned. 
Both are roughly of the same venerable age. We are proud to be so 
closely associated with them.‬‪‬‪

'We have been privileged to receive 
the best of university educations. Secondly, we all love St Andrews.  We
 love it for the academic start in life it gives us. 

'We love it for its
 traditions - traditions that lie at the very heart of Scotland’s 
history. 

'We love it because it made us look beyond St Andrews, beyond 
the borders of Scotland, to the wide world.

'But perhaps most important 
of all, we love it for the friendships it has given us.

'As I look around this hall tonight – 
and even take a peek at the person sitting three from my left – I thank 
God for those friendships - our friendship - forged in our ancient 
halls. 

'I even include in that one of my alma mater, who shall remain 
nameless, here tonight who rang me today to say he’d pay good money for 
me not to speak!‬‪‬‪'
