Motorists in California are using less and less gas so state lawmakers are considering imposing a mileage fee to recoup lost gas tax revenue 

Plummeting gas tax revenues have led California to consider imposing a fee on motorists for each mile they drive.

The number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles on the state's roadways has increased in recent years, leading motorists to use less and less gas.

The reduction in gas consumption has led to a reduction in gas tax revenues for the state. 

California collects a 2.25 per cent sales tax on gasoline and a 9.67 per cent tax on diesel. 

That shortfall has left less money to pay for repairs to state highways, roads, bridges and other necessary maintenance. 

In an effort to make up the difference, state officials are considering a plan that would replace the gas tax with an imposed fee for each mile motorists drive.

'We're going to have to find another way to finance the upkeep of the roads,' California Governor Jerry Brown said earlier this month, the San Jose Mercury News reported.  

He has already approved the creation of a commission to study a 'road usage charge'.

The bill which created the 15-member commission also calls for it to establish a program by  2017.

State Representative Mark DeSaulnier helped write the bill that Brown signed into law. 

He said: 'I think there's a long way to go before this is implemented. 

'But we have a real problem when it comes to infrastructure in California.

'We have to do something.'

Oregon is already testing a program which requires some drivers to pay 1.5 cents per mile driven and Colorado and Washington are considering similar initiatives.

It is unclear how California's plan would handle what would occur when people drive out of state or how the miles would be monitored. 

California taxed nearly ten billion gallons of gas in the first eight months of 2014, 24/7 Wall Street reported.
