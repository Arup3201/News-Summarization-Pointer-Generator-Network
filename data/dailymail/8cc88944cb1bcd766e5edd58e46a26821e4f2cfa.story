A mother from Scotland has vented her frustration after council workers refused to collect her bin because it was left open one inch.

The binmen, from Midlothian Council, said that new health and safety rules meant they couldn't collect the waste, claiming the bag had become jammed.

Susan Wright, 39, from Dalkeith, owns the bin and has called the decision 'bonkers'.

Susan Wright, 39, a mother-of-three from Dalkeith has hit out at Midlothian Council after workers refused to empty her bin which had a bag caught in the lid

The mother-of-three said: ‘Surely there’s common sense that tells you that you can lift a bin lid up to see if the bin is overflowing or not, or whether a bag’s just caught.

'They didn’t even bother to do that. They go on about health and safety of their workers, but what about the health and safety of my family?

'We’re a family of five, I’ve got a young baby and I’ve now got to store a month’s worth of bin rubbish.’

However when she complained officials told her she would have to wait a fortnight for the binmen to come back, as workers are being told not to empty any bin which is left open, whether it is overflowing or not.

In a statement, the council said: ‘As you know, due to health and safety regulations, the binmen are now not emptying bins where the lid is open. This is a procedure that they are following very strictly.

‘It is unlikely that the men will call back to empty your bin. I understand that in this case it was not due to the bin overflowing. I have therefore passed your concerns onto the waste management team for information.’

The workers claimed that a bag had become jammed in the lid (pictured) and that they couldn't empty it for 'health and safety reasons'

Mrs Wright claims there are another eight or ten bins that have not been collected because the lids have been left open under the draconian new rules.

Local councillor Margot Russell said common sense had not been used, adding: ‘I’ve seen buckets where the lid is halfway open and it’s full.

'The policy at the moment is that the guys wouldn’t touch that, but this particular one is only a smidgeon – a wee bit – open. They’ve maybe taken the guidelines too strictly.’

Midlothian Council is receiving about 200 calls a day from residents about bins not being collected by the 100 staff that work in waste management.
