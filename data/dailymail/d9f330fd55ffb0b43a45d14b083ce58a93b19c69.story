Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, claimed Vladimir Putin is 'testing' Britain's reaction times

Planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by Russian jets in a highly dangerous 'game of chicken', a former head of the armed forces has warned.

Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup, a former chief of the defence staff, claimed Vladimir Putin is 'testing' the resolve of Britain and its Nato allies in the stand-off in Ukraine.

He accused Moscow of pursuing an 'aggressive' strategy of probing UK defences, using flights by Russian long-range Bear bombers off Bournemouth and the coast of Cornwall.

Two Russian bombers last week skirted British airspace off the coast of Cornwall, where they were intercepted and escorted by the two RAF Typhoon fighters.

It came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth last month.

Lord Stirrup said the flights were not 'joy rides' but 'mission rehearsals' designed to test Britain's capability to react.

He told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: 'They are becoming more aggressive. These aircraft - Russian Bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides. They are mission rehearsals,' he said.

'These aircraft launch stand-off missiles against Western targets and just as they used to do in the Cold War they are practising those profiles.

'They are testing us, they are testing our defences, they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that's very dangerous.

'So we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision, not between RAF and Russia aircraft, but between Russian aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing.' 

Official figures show that RAF jets have been scrambled to deter Russian plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014, including 8 times last year.

A third of all incidents in which RAF pilots were deployed involved a plan from Russia. 

Lord Stirrup suggested that Britain should now consider supplying arms to the Ukraine government to counter the superior firepower of the separatist rebels who are being supplied by Moscow.

'Nato over the years, in the eyes of Putin at least, has become weak. Putin views the West as weak all round and that is a very, very dangerous position for us to be in,' he told Sky News's Murnaghan programme.

'My concern is that Nato is not spending enough resource on defence. If Nato is weak or is perceived to be weak by Putin then the risk of miscalculation is much greater and our security is much lowered as a result.'

Lord Stirrup, who was head of the armed forces at the time of the 2010 strategic defence and security review, said the 'swingeing cuts' to defence spending had left the forces 'right on the limit' and needed to be reversed.

Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included:

Wednesday: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall.

Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel.

Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth.

Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland.

Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne.

Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland.

Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain.

He was backed by Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, who said that all the political parties now needed to commit to maintaining the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence.

'This is absolutely central. Every party must in their manifesto commit to 2% spending on defence,' he told Sky News.

'That is what Nato is about. It is passing the message to Putin that Nato is a serious organisation that is prepared to defend its territory.

'Deterrence is about psychology. That 2 per cent figure is something he is going to be looking at very carefully because that is what we used to show that we are serious.'

Increasing aggression from Russia has led to calls for military support for the Ukrainian government.

Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox has said the West should now consider arming the government in Kiev.

But the idea was rejected by Commons Leader William Hague, who said that the right approach was to ratchet up sanctions if Russia continued to de-stabilise Ukraine.

'We are not planning as the UK to send arms to Ukraine. It hasn't been our approach in any recent conflict in recent years to send arms into those conflicts,' Mr Hague, who was foreign secretary until last year, told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show.

'We want to see a diplomatic solution. We believe that that long-term economic price toRussia and all of those other penalties are the right penalties for Russia to pay. You have to think very carefully before you send additional arms into a conflict.'
