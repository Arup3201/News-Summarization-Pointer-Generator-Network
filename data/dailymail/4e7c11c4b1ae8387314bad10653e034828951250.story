FIFA has agreed to reveal the details of two controversial World Cup bids after their corruption investigator resigned amid claims of an alleged cover up.

American lawyer Michael Garcia was tasked with investigating corruption claims concerning the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids won by Russia and Qatar. 

Mr Garcia resigned as FIFA's ethics investigator on Wednesday after the association refused to allow him to challenge findings that cleared the Russian and Qatari bids of any wrongdoing during the selection process.

Michael Garcia, pictured, was tasked with looking into the bidding process concerning the 2018 and 2022 World Cup competitions which were awarded to Russia and Qatar amid allegations of corruption 

Mr Garcia accused FIFA of suffering from 'a lack of leadership' and announced his resignation on Wednesday. 

He resigned on the eve of a major meeting of FIFA's executive committee which is responsible for running world football.

The committee has been under considerable pressure over allegations surrounding the process used to choose the venues for the next two World Cups.  

At today's meeting in Morocco, FIFA agreed that the 430-page report should be published, with certain names and details redacted for legal reasons.

However, the report's publication will be delayed until the ethics committee considers charges against three of FIFA's ruling executive committee. 

American lawyer Michael Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. He quit on Wednesday as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups.

Today's meeting was addressed by Domenico Scala, head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee who advised that an 'appropriate form' of Mr Garcia's report should be published, with names and other details redacted for legal reasons.

This was agreed unanimously by the executive committee.

German member Theo Zwanziger wanted to change FIFA's ethics code rules to publish the report immediately and in full, but this proposal was not considered by the committe..  

FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, from Northern Ireland, welcomed the move.

JULY 2012

FIFA appoint US lawyer Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to their Ethics Committee. Garcia is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

SEPTEMBER 2014

Garcia submits his 430-page report. Eckert says it will not be made public, with only his summary published.

OCTOBER 2014

Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’

NOVEMBER 2014

Eckert publishes his summary, which clears Russia and Qatar of corruption, but claims England had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign. Garcia says the findings contain ‘erroneous representations ’, and says he will appeal.

DECEMBER 2014

FIFA dismiss Garcia’s complaint to their Appeal Committee. Garcia resigns from the Ethics Committee.

He said: 'I am pleased the the FIFA executive committee decided without a vote to publish this report. It shows that people at FIFA at the moment do desire transparency and the sooner we can get on with talking about the game of football that we all love, the better.'

FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: 'I am pleased they have agreed. It has been a long process to arrive at this point and I understand the views of those who have been critical.

'We have always been determined that the truth should be known. That is, after all, why we set up an independent Ethics Committee with an investigatory chamber that has all necessary means to undertake investigations on its own initiative.' 

Mr Garcia, who said himself that the report should be published, spent 18 months investigating allegations of corruption in the bidding process, during which he interviewed 75 witnesses.

In November, FIFA's ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert issued a 42-page summary based on Garcia's report which identified cases of 'inappropriate conduct' in a number of the bids but said there was not enough evidence to justify re-opening the bidding process.

In Friday's statement, MrBlatter reiterated that the bidding process for the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would not be re-opened.

He said: 'We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts commissioned by Mr Scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the Executive Committee's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

'Now it is important that the work of the Ethics Committee continues and that any instances of wrongdoing are fully investigated and their perpetrators pursued and sanctioned.'

Mr Garcia, who appealed against the summary of his investigation, saying it contained misrepresentations, resigned on Wednesday, one day after a FIFA tribunal ruled his application to be inadmissible. 

The executive committee also appointed Zurich-based Swiss lawyer Cornel Borbely to replace Mr Garcia in an acting capacity. He had previously been Garcia's deputy and investigated the Russian and American World Cup bids.  

Mr Garcia said: 'It is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. No independent governance committee, investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation.’ 

Sepp Blatter, pictured today in Morocco, said that he 'understands the views of those who have been critical'
