Superbike champion: Sean Emmett (pictured), 45, flew into a rage over his girlfriend's table manners

A drunken former British Superbike champion who attacked his girlfriend because he didn’t like the way she was eating has been jailed for three months.

Sean Emmett, 45, of Molesey, Surrey, flew into a rage over the table manners of Lana Saoud, 25, after drinking eight pints of Guinness - throttling her and hitting her around the face.

Blood was found all over the room where the 45-year-old motorcyclist and his partner of two years Miss Saoud were staying following the attack, Guildford Magistrates’ Court was told.

A judge was told father-of-three Emmett lost his temper after the couple returned to the house where they were staying with a takeaway - and he took exception to the way she was eating.

He admitted assault and was jailed for 12 weeks last Friday. Emmett's former wife Abbie died after falling to her death from a hotel while they were on their honeymoon in Dubai in 2013.

At court last week, Carole Fern, prosecuting, said Emmett had calmly returned to the pub to drink more after beating up Miss Saoud. She was left in the street with a nose bleed.

Ms Fern added: ‘They were eating dinner, she was eating quickly as she was hungry. They had a difference of opinion about her manner of eating. She said he grabbed her around the neck with one hand and hit her in the face. 

'He does say she slapped him first and in her statement she does say she slapped him.’  Ms Fern said the man who they were staying with then heard Emmett tell his partner to ‘get out’.

‘She’s injured now and she’s on the street,’ the prosecutor said. ‘It’s about 8.30 or 9 in the evening. While this is happening the defendant goes back to the pub.

‘There are young people outside the Royal Oak pub and the victim is trying to cover her face with her hands. She says “please call me an ambulance, he’s hurt me”.’

However, Miss Saoub later told police and paramedics that she had sustained her injuries after falling over. Ms Fern said she had been left with hand marks around her neck, a very bruised left cheek bone and injuries to her nose.

The Lebanese national had already been attacked by Emmett once before, resulting in him being given a domestic violence protection order, the court heard.

Ms Fern said: ‘She’s vulnerable, she has no place else to go. He has the control there. 

'It’s aggravated by the fact he had a DVPO for the same victim that was breached by taking her away and he served time for that.’

The court was also told how Miss Saoud had given police a statement from her bed in Kingston Hospital in which she said her boyfriend had drunk ‘seven or eight pints of Guinness and she drank four or five’.

The couple had been drinking at The Lord Hotham pub in West Molesey, before the attack took place on January 24 this year.

Simon Collingham, defending, told the court that Emmett admitted going ‘beyond reasonable force’, but claimed it was ‘dangerous’ to speculate about other issues.

He said: ‘Those who deal with the defendant make no comment about his intoxication whatsoever. Do you think it would have been something they would have mentioned? 

‘We only have to judge the case on the facts. He had no intention to cause great harm.' 

Mr Collingham revealed the pair are now engaged to be married and added there had been correspondence between the two while he was in custody.

Chair of the bench Jane Bak decided not to issue a restraining order to Emmett after hearing Miss Saoud did not want one. As well as being jailed, Emmett was told to pay an £80 victim surcharge.
