Few Triple-A titles can live up to their hype, and none carry more expectation than the Halo series.

But where many have failed, Halo 4 succeeds, by not only meeting fans' demands, but exceeding them in almost every way possible.

Standing tall:  The Master Chief's animation has been overhauled to make him move more realistically - especially noticeable in the game's frequent cut-scenes

Once again, you are put in control of the Master Chief, who has been floating in space on a wrecked warship called the Forward Unto Dawn.

It's not long before events take him and long-standing AI, Cortana, to a mysterious Planet called Requiem - inhabited by a species called Forerunners.

Without giving too much away, what follows is an emotional, gripping, often dark yet frequently charming single-player campaign like nothing experienced before.

Gameplay, however, is slightly more familiar. Developers 343, who have taken over from Bungie, have stayed true to the original, offering highly-kinetic gunplay.

Levels are often multi-layered, giving you the freedom to attack enemy strong points how you want.

There's a vast array of weapons available, too, from the rapid-firing SAW to the traditional assault rifle and shotgun, plus some brilliantly designed Forerunner weapons.

Stunning: Halo 4 is a remarkable technical achievement, boasting graphics never before seen on the aging console

Similar to Halo: Reach, the Master Chief can equip power ups such as shields, sentry guns and Promethean Vision.

Each one is cleverly knitted into the game's narrative and not just thrown in without an explanation.

But perhaps Halo 4's greatest achievement are its visuals and artistic design. The 2001 Xbox original stretched the console to its limit - boasting 'hyper realistic' environments and varied, Intricately-detailed levels.

Sadly, Halo's reputation of being an aesthetic powerhouse has dimmed over the years - with Halo 3, especially, lacking the visual panache many were expecting.

Thankfully, Halo 4 has done things differently and is the best-looking game on the console.

Textures burst with detail, and vistas are so well-imagined and epic in scale that it's often tempting to stop just to soak up the sights.

Indeed, it's a shame that it's towards the end of the console's life that we are treated to the immense graphical feats in can achieve.

The visual flair extends to the character models, too. All humans have lost that googly-eyed, cartoon-look, replaced by NPCs who are capable of showing emotion.

Deep: The relationship between Cortana and the Master Chief reaches new levels

The Covenant are well-detailed beasts packed with character - a far cry from the clumsy lumps of Blue and Red in Halo 3.

And the Promethean enemies, are multi-layered, beautifully animated creations - exposing their vibrant exo-skeletons when shot, before disintegrating into a splendid ball of orange light.

Thankfully, AI has also been improved. Marines no longer gleefully run you over with their Warthogs, or drive you off a cliff when you're in a gunner seat. 

Covenant and Prometheans display behaviour with an awareness of hierarchy.

If a Promethean Knight or Red Elite is killed, for example, the pack of grunts will panic, disperse, or light plasma grenades and charge at you.

There's overarching sense of character in Halo 4, which was only touched on in Halo: Reach. The main reason behind this is that the Master Chief now speaks.

This allows the player to peek through a window into the relationship between him and Cortana for the first time - revealing a more human side to the character that was perhaps presented as no more than a ruthless cyborg in the earlier outings.

Interestingly, multiplayer has a hint of Call of Duty about it. There are lots of new perks available as you rise up the levels – including new armor, weapons and abilities.

A blast: Multiplayer, as per usual in Halo games, is strong,  and has been slightly influenced by Call of Duty

There is also Spartan Ops which offers a series of short-length missions that are playable with up to four players.

Five missions are available from launch, with more promised in the future. The short film that accompanies each episode stops it from feeling like an after-thought, too.

Magical from start to finish, forget game of the year - this is the game of the century.
