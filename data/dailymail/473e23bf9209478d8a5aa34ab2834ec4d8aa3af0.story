Fire chiefs have been accused of 'burning money' after spending £17,000 on bizarre plastic hands for people to press buttons on their smoke alarms.

The 2ft-long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money.

And householders are given the pointers during home fire safety checks - to show them how to press the test button on ceiling-mounted smoke alarms.

Waste? These 2ft-long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money

But the cost of £1.75 a stick was branded a waste when people can just use their own fingers or any stick or broomhandle to test the alarms.

Fire Authority member Gordon Walker said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous waste of money, particularly when budgets are so tight for public services. All people have to do is use a broom handle or something similar'.

Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks, at a cost of £1.75 each - a total of £17,500.

The sticks are approximately 24in long or just over two foot including the pointing finger. But they were blasted as a 'pointless laughing stock' by some householders.

One homeowner said: 'It looks like a comedy toy or a backscratcher rather then something the fire service should be spending its money on.

'Perhaps they should get the point - it is like burning money. Everyone's got a brush or broomhandle in their house.'

A fire service spokesman said the 
sticks were specifically for the elderly and immobile - so they would 
not have to use a stool or stepladder to test their alarms.

He
 confirmed the Labour-run Welsh Government had funded the hand on a 
stick giveaway in a campaign called 'Point the finger at safety - push 
the button not your luck.'

The sticks are described as 'simple and functional hand held pointers' by fire chiefs.

Assistant Chief Fire Officer Chris 
Davies, the service's director of risk, said: 'As the statistics show 
it's not enough to have a smoke alarm fitted in your home.

'These
 alarms need to be tested weekly and dusted regularly to ensure they are
 in working order should the worst case scenario happen.

'It looks like a comedy toy or a backscratcher rather then something the fire service should be spending its money on.'

'The testing sticks have been purchased as part of our prevention and protection strategy to provide elderly and immobile members of our communities with the help they need to test and maintain their smoke alarms safely.'

The sticks have a bilingual safety message on them reminding people in both Welsh and English to test their alarms every week.

A Welsh Government spokesman added: 'We have allocated a total of £900,000 to all three Fire and Rescue Services in Wales through our Community Fire Safety grant.

'It is a matter for the rescue services to decide on the equipment they require.'
