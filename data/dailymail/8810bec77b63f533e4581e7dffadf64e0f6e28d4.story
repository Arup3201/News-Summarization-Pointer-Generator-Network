A Minnesota woman whose body was found just steps from her front doorstep died of hypothermia complicated by acute alcohol intoxication, the state medical examiner has concluded.

Andrea Christine Marker, 32, was found around 4pm on January 7 by her sister close to the front door of the home she shared with her parents and one of her sisters on Illinois Court, Lakeville.

Her body had been obscured by snowbanks and the police chief said she could have been outside for as long as 20 hours.

Close to home: Andrea Marker had almost reached her front door but died in the snow of hypothermia complicated by alcohol toxicity

The last time a family member had spoken to Marker was 8pm the evening before.

Interim Lakeville Police Chief John Kornmann told the Star Tribune that Marker had removed most of her clothing when she was found, indicating she had experienced something known as paradoxical undressing, common in victims of hypothermia.

The phenomenon makes a person feel warm even as they are freezing to death.

The family of Andrea Marker said last week that she had waged a long battle with alcohol.

Addiction: Marker, a mother, aunt, sister and daughter, had long struggled with alcohol, according to her family

Just two days before she was found dead, Marker's family had called police to the house in the early hours of the morning.

Marker was extremely intoxicated and her family was worried she would harm herself. The call-out was ultimately deemed a mental-health check by police.

According to the Star Tribune, Marker was taken to the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview for a mental health examination. It is unclear how long she remained at the hospital.

Exposure: Marker was found outside the home she shared with her parents and sister. Her body had been obscured from the road by snow banks

The night Marker died, temperatures were in the low single digits.

Investigators are focusing on where Marker had been in the 24 hours before her body was found.

Andrea Marker, known as Andie to her loved ones, is survived by a son, her parents and four siblings.
