X Factor bosses are 'tearing up the format' of ITV's flagship show after a string of disastrous viewing figures, with Sunday's final drawing its worst audience for seven years.

According to reports, ITV bosses are set to hold emergency talks with Simon Cowell in anticipation of a complete overhaul of the show's format and judging panel.

Despite putting more money into the show's budget, ratings have halved in two years, and now show chiefs are said to be planning a 'back to basics' approach.

Revamp: It's been reported that the ITV1 is set to go back to basic for the 10th series

The X Factor's ratings slide continued with Sunday's final pulling in 2 million fewer viewers than last year.

Crisis: Simon Cowell is set to sit down and talk through what's next for The X Factor with ITV in the new year following poor ratings

Figures from ITV show that Sunday 
night's two-hour programme, which was won by James Arthur, had an 
average audience of 11.1 million compared with the 13.1 million who 
watched Little Mix win in 2011.

And on Saturday the first part of the
X Factor final - eventually won by James Arthur, 24, had its worst 
audience for seven years as it failed to beat rival Strictly Come 
Dancing again.

X
Factor attracted an average audience of 9.5 million for the first stage
of the final - the lowest audience since 2005 when 9.2 million watched 
Shayne Ward win the show.

The
ITV1 show trailed its BBC1 rival by 1.3 million viewers and it is 
especially embarrassing for The X Factor chiefs because Strictly is 
still two weeks away from hosting its own final.

Now bosses are said to be planning to axe the arena auditions in favour of a more low-key approach.

The new format will include shifting 
the start of next year's show to the weekend after children return to 
school in order to make it more popular with a younger audience.

According to The Sun newspaper, 
Saturday's shows are set to start earlier to avoid the dip in ratings 
after 10pm.

On the chopping board: According to a source Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos could be removed from the judging panel as Cowell plans to rejig things

A production source said: 'It doesn’t take a genius to work out that the show is not in the best health.

'We have had some very strong singers this year but the show is feeling in need of a reboot.'

While another insider claims that Cowell could return to the show as a judge solely during the live shows..

Judges Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos are said to be favourites to face the chop in a cull of the judging panel.

Not winning: This year the final had its worst audience for seven years on Saturday night - and it failed to beat rival Strictly Come Dancing

And one report claimed Cheryl Cole was 
set to return to the X Factor to give the show a boost.

No chance: Cheryl Cole will not be returning to the show that unceremoniously dumped her

But this was categorically denied by the Girls Aloud's singer's spokesperson.

This sounded even more unlikely against the backdrop of Cheryl's $1.4million lawsuit against the U.S. X Factor blindsided show bosses.

A source close to Cowell said: ‘This is a
bolt from the blue. Simon thought he’d patched things up with Cheryl. 
But now she’s attacking when the show is weak.'

In Sunday's live final James, was speechless as he learned that he had gained more votes than runner up Jahmene Douglas.

He said: 'Thank you, thank you so much. Have I really won? Wow. I don't know what to say.'

Jahmene praised the winner and told Dermot: 'It's such a blessing to even share a stage with such a talent, he's my idol.'

The Middlesbrough-born star, who won with 54 percent of the public vote, was presented with his winner's single, a cover of Shontelle's Impossible.

A spokeswoman for the show said: 'The 
series has only just ended but of course we'll review the production, as
we do with all our long-running shows. No details on next year's show 
have been decided yet.'
