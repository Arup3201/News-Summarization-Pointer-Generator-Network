Matt Damon had to drop the price but still made a profit after closing on a deal to sell his waterfront Miami estate overlooking Biscayne Bay.

Patrick Markert, CEO of AmeriSave Mortgage, purchased the property, which the actor had listed at $18.999million, for $15.375million, according to South Florida Business Journal.

The actor bought the seven-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom mansion, known as Maravilla, along with an adjacent lot for the price of $14.5million back in 2005, the year he married his wife Luciana Bozan Barroso.

Payday: The 44-year-old actor, pictured earlier in December on the way to the gym, made $875,000 on the sale of his home

The home was built in 1935, offering 12,705 square feet that includes seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, along with a theater, wine cellar, gourmet kitchen.

A rooftop terrace and living room offer views of Biscayne Bay seen over the home's 170-foot waterfront.

Also on the property is a pool with bay views, a pool house and-two bedroom guest house, according to Zillow. 

Markert bought the property to provide a single-family home to raise his children in, agents Jill Eber and Jill Hertzberg told the Wall Street Journal.

The agents were also representing Markert, who had recently finalized the sale of a trio of adjacent units in a South Beach condominium for $27.5million. 

Damon met his wife in Miami in 2003 while she was bartending and he was filming the movie Stuck On You.

Damon apparently had to drop the price of his waterfront mansion to attract a buyer, shaving off a million from the $20million listing price the home had last year.  

The actor can be seen in the sci-fi epic Interstellar with Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, who will join him in his next movie The Martian, set for release in 2015.
