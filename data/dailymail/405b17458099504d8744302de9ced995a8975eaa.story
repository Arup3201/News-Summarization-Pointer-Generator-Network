Giorgio Chiellini claims the apparent bite from Luis Suarez was 'clear, clear-cut' and that the Uruguay striker should have been dismissed immediately for his actions.

The Italian defender clashed with the Liverpool man during a World Cup Group D decider, but  despite displaying bite marks on his shoulder no action was taken. Minutes later the South Americans scored a crucial winner.

Chiellini labels Suarez, who has previous when it comes to these actions, a 'sneak', who FIFA allow to get away with these things as he is a star player. FIFA told the BBC: 'We are awaiting the official match report and will gather all the necessary elements before making a decision.’

The Juventus stopper also believes video evidence should be used to ban the forward, slamming the referee for not taking action straight away.

'It was ridiculous not to send Suarez off,” Chiellini told Rai TV.

'It is clear, clear-cut and then there was the obvious dive afterwards because he knew very well that he did something that he shouldn’t have done.

And Chiellini continued, telling Sky Sports Italia: 'Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup.

'I'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him. The referee saw the bite mark too, but he did nothing about it.'

Suarez was banned for eight games in England after biting Branislav Ivanovic in 2013, and was also judged to have done the same thing when playing for Ajax.

But the striker, who is a target for Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer, swerved questions on the subject after the final whistle.

'Uruguay is celebrating, we have qualified and now we are going to celebrate this moment because next we have to start thinking about our next opponents.

'The truth is that the team worked incredibly hard and we deserve it.

'After making a bad start to the group against Costa Rica, the best we deserved was this and we showed that we deserve to stay in this World Cup.

'The heat was incredible and we were worn out.'
