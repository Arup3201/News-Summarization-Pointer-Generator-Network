A collection of photographs taken by Dennis Hopper which went undiscovered until his death are to be exhibited.

Hopper had a long an illustrious career as a Hollywood actor and is best known for his roles in Rebel Without A Cause, Blue Velvet and Apocalypse Now.

However, he was also a prolific painter and sculptor and also took hundreds of photographs in the 1960s, capturing a time of social change in America.

Cultural: The exhibition of mainly black and white images captured 
cultural the transformation that took place in 1960s America

In particular, Hopper took up photography intensively from 1961 – 1967 and captured numerous significant political moments.

Boxes of photographs taken by the star were discovered by his family following his death in 2010. The exhibition will feature 400 of these images.

Speaking to The Guardian, the Royal Academy's director of exhibitions, Kathleen Soriano, said the family's discovery showed 'just how obsessively Hopper took photographs.'

She added that most of the images were taken using a 35mm Nikon camera that was given to Hopper by his wife after their house was destroyed by fire in 1961. A selection of Hopper's paintings were destroyed in the fire.

civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King during a march from Selma to 
Montgomery in 1965, as well as images from Hopper's travels in 
Mexico.

Portraits of artists and actors including Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Paul Newman will also be showed.

The show, called Dennis Hopper: The Lost Album, was first seen in Berlin last year and will be staged in the Royal Academy's Burlington Gardens galleries between June and August next year.

The latest show is part of the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition which is now in its 246th year.

The exhibition is the world’s largest open submission of contemporary art and showcases work by both emerging and established artists in all media, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking, architecture and film.
