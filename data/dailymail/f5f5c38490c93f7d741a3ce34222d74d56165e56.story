Reunion: Mark Newbould with partner Susan Garner, who was told her partner was dying by hospital staff and comforted the wrong man in an ambulance

Blundering hospital staff wrongly told a patient’s partner and son that he was fighting for his life.

They were ushered into an ambulance to accompany Mark Newbould to a specialist unit.

Susan Garner and Ryan Newbould were told that Mr Newbould, 53, who had gone to A&E with a bad back, had suffered a severe heart attack and was critically ill.

In the ambulance, a distraught Miss Garner comforted the patient, whose face was obscured by an oxygen mask, kissed him on the forehead and told him she loved him.

But staff at A&E had put the wrong relatives in the ambulance and the man Miss Garner kissed was a stranger of similar age, build and appearance to her partner.

It was only when a paramedic referred to the patient by a different name that Ryan took a closer look – and realised from his moustache that the man was not his father. Mr Newbould, an industrial cleaner, had called an ambulance to his home in Skipton, West Yorkshire, because of agonising back pain. Miss Garner, 63, his partner of 14 years, came home and spoke to him as he was treated in the ambulance.

‘He didn’t look well, but he was certainly not on his deathbed,’ she said. She and Ryan, 26, followed the ambulance to hospital in their car.

As they walked into the A&E unit 
at Airedale Hospital in Keighley, a woman approached them and said: 
‘Susan, can you come with me? Your partner is seriously ill and we need 
to get him to Leeds General Infirmary urgently.’

Confused: Susan Garner, 63, even kissed the 
mystery patient on the head and told him 'it'll be okay', not recognising 
him because of his gas mask

Error: While his family were on their way to Leeds, Mark Newbould was sitting in A&E at Airedale Hospital, West Yorkshire (pictured) waiting to be assessed and wondering where they were

Miss Garner said she did not question this as two years earlier Mr Newbould had nearly died from a serious heart condition.

During the journey she asked the 
paramedic how seriously ill Mark was and she was told his chances 
weren’t good. Later the paramedic asked: ‘What did you say his name 
was?’ When she answered, he said: ‘Well, we haven’t got Mark Newbould in
the back here.’

Serious: Mark Newbould says that the story sounds like a 'sketch' but says it could have had serious consequences for the other man

Miss Garner said: ‘I really thought it was a sick prank, but they assured me it wasn’t.

‘My only slight comfort was that if 
this man knew what was going on, he might have felt better knowing 
someone was there from him.’

Miss Garner and Ryan had phoned their 
workplaces to say Mr Newbould could die. They had to call back to say it
had all been a mistake. ‘People ask us how we didn’t realise it wasn’t 
Mark, but Ryan was sat next to him for the whole journey,’ Miss Garner 
said.

‘It was only when the oxygen mask came off that we saw he had a moustache.’

Ryan, a sales assistant, said: ‘Part 
of me was happy because I realised I wasn’t losing my dad but then I 
didn’t know whether this guy in front of me was going to live.

‘My mum always told me never to get into a car with a stranger, but never an ambulance.’

They continued the 23-mile journey to 
Leeds General Infirmary so the man could be treated. The family were 
later told he recovered. The hospital laid on a taxi to take them back 
to Airedale casualty department, where Mr Newbould – who had nothing 
more life-threatening than severe back spasms – had been wondering for 
an hour and a half where Miss Garner and his son had vanished to.

‘It’s a bit of a comedy sketch moment when you first hear what happened,’ he said.

‘But then you realise how serious a 
blunder it really was. If the paramedics had asked Susan or Ryan if I 
was allergic to anything or on any medication, they would have said “No”
and this man could have been given something that may have potentially 
killed him.’

Mr Newbould spent four hours in 
A&E but collapsed in agony as he was being discharged and ended up 
spending the night in hospital.

Andrew Catto, executive medical 
director at Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, said Mr Newbould and his 
family had received an apology for the mix-up. Identification procedures
for relatives were being reviewed, he added.
