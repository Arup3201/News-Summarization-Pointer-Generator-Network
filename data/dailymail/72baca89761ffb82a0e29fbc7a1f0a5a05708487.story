Hospital managers have apologised to the family of a 34st man who died after doctors delayed giving him a potentially life-saving scan - because he was too fat for their machine.

Lee Perry, 26, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with suspected inflammation of the spine on November 6, 2012.

He was suffering from sporadic numbness in his legs and was struggling to walk.

He was booked in for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis and to detect signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but it was ruled he was too large for the machine.

Doctors even called zoos and an equine centre to see if they had a big enough scanner which could be used - but they were not available.

While waiting for a scan in hospital, Mr Perry, a carer from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, developed DVT and on November 29 he died of a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lungs.

Tragically, he was due to finally undergo an MRI scan the day after his death.

His heartbroken family lodged a formal complaint with the hospital and NHS chiefs apologised for their treatment of Mr Perry.

His mother Angela Scrase, 54, believes he could have survived if he had had better care at the hospital and they had been better prepared to treat a morbidly obese patient.

The hospital has now apologised to Mr Perry's heartbroken mother, Angela Scrase

Mrs Scrase, also from Market Harborough, said: ‘The lack of progress with his treatment just left him hopeless and so he stopped getting better.

‘He was crying all the time and saying he wanted to be at home because he felt trapped in the hospital with no one looking after him and he couldn’t move.

‘He didn’t even have a buzzer to call for help and all he was told to do was shout if he needed anything.

‘He texted me one morning saying he had tried to call for help for two hours before anyone came.

Mr Perry was admitted to hospital after developing numbness in his legs. Doctors suspected that he had inflammation of the spine and needed to carry out an MRI scan to confirm this

Mrs Scrase said that before her son developed the numbness in his legs he was healthy and did a lot of cycling and swimming despite his size

‘He just wanted to know what exactly was wrong with him and know how to get better.

‘I admit he shouldn’t have been that weight but the care he received was terrible, he was as fit as a flea before he got ill.

‘Despite his size he was always outdoors, riding a bike and swimming. He was such a lovely lad and I adored him.

‘He did start to get the feeling back in his legs and he started physio but the progress wasn’t very good.

‘Before he died he couldn’t breathe and I said they should be transferring him to intensive care but they [the hospital] wouldn’t.

‘They had found a blood clot but it was too late. He died at midnight and I went crazy and wouldn’t let anyone touch him.’

The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has apologised to Mr Perry’s family and admitted they need to improve their care for obese patients.

Rachel Overfield, Chief Nurse at Leicester’s Hospitals, said: 'We have met with and apologised to Mr Perry’s family, and would again like to offer our condolences for their loss.

'They raised a number of concerns with us and these were discussed with them through meetings and correspondence.

'At the time we recognised that we could have done some things differently to overcome a few specific challenges involved in caring for bariatric patients in hospital. 

'Whilst Mr Perry was with us we provided him with a bariatric chair and a specially ordered bed with a pressure relieving mattress to reduce his risk of developing a pressure ulcer. 

'Mr Perry was also receiving the appropriate medication to prevent a blood clot as well as physiotherapy. 

Mrs Scrase said: 'He was such a lovely lad and I adored him'

The hospital has apologised to Mr Perry's family and says it has invested in better facilities for obese patients

'Since then we have continued to improve processes and the specialist equipment we have available for this patient group.

'Unfortunately at the time there was a delay in accessing a suitable MRI for Mr Perry. 

'Last year we replaced all of our MRI scanners and have purchased the widest ones available, which can take a patient up to 200kgs. 

'It is worth pointing out that it is very rare that we are unable to scan a patient because of their weight, and on the rare occasions we do have difficulties it is because of the patients’ body shape and their inability to fit into the machine. 

'In these instances we would refer the patient to the nearest hospital with the equipment to perform the MRI, which happens to be over 90 miles away in Cheltenham.'
