A New Jersey man has somehow survived ingesting 30 bags of heroin - or so he claims - while being chased down by police following an attempted robbery.

Michael Pelissier, 42, is accused of breaking into the Petco store on Route 17 north around 2.30am Tuesday.

Officers saw a suspicious 2004 Dodge Ram pickup pull out from behind the store and say Pelissier and another man, Robert Kwiatkowski, 52, were inside.

A plate check on the truck showed its plates were bogus and it had been stolen one week prior, according to NJ.com.

When cops flickered their sirens at the vehicle, the pair quickly pulled over and started running.

Police caught both of them after a brief chase.

As they were arresting Pelissier, he told police he had just swallowed 30 bags of heroin.

Pelissier was then taken to Bergen Regional Medical Center.

Doctors were able to remove the bags from Pelissier without any of them breaking, which could have been fatal.

Inside the pickup police found more heroin and hypodermic needles.

They also recovered large spools of copper wire and an assortment of power and hand tools.  

Scene: The two had allegedly broken into the Petco store on Route 17 north in Jersey around 2.30am Tuesday

The two were booked into Bergen County Jail.

They have been charged with receiving stolen property, possession of heroin and possession of narcotics paraphernalia. 

Pelissier also was charged with eluding police.
