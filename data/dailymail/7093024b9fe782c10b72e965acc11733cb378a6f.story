With its rotting bodywork, rusty wheels and gathering of mould, it may not be a shining example of Ferrari's first ever four-seater.

But the rare car has been saved from the scrapyard and is tipped to sell for £40,000 at auction.

The 1965 Ferrari 330GT 2+2 Berlinetta was one of the first designed for family use and is expected to be worth at least £150,000 once restored to its former glory.

A mouldy old Ferrari that has been sat gathering dust in a garage for 20 years is set to fetch £40,000 when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams, London

Despite being in less than showroom condition, the historic car was the famous Italian marque's first attempt at family motoring

The classic red car has been sat in a garage for the last 20 years, gathering mould on its leather seats.

It has filthy windows and rusting wheels, not to mention the green grime covering the famous Ferrari prancing horse badge.

But experts are confident it will still appeal to enthusiasts looking for a restoration project.

Rob Hubbard, senior car specialist at 
auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'It was brought back from America by the 
owners in the late 1980s. It was put away in the garage and it was never
 used again.

'This will appeal to somebody who wants to put a bit of work into it.

'If they do it will be worth about three times as much.

The dirty back seats in the car that are dusty and covered in mud

When fully operational, the 1965 Ferrari 300 GT 2+2 model can reach a top speed of 152mph.

The car can achieve 0-60mph in 6.6seconds.

It is a rear-wheel drive with a manual 5-speed gearbox, running on petrol.

Originally Ferraris were designed with two seats only but by the end of the 1950s the market for sports cars which could accommodate families had grown.

In response to that demand Ferrari introduced four seats with its 250GTE 2+2 model before bringing out the 330GT with a four-litre V12 engine in 1964.

The rusty Ferrari was originally sold in
 Wiltshire in 1965 before an American bought it and took it to Florida, 
where it was restored in the early 1980s, with the engine rebuilt.

The car has been left to gather in dust

The current owners took it back to 
their home in Kendal, in the Lake District, in the late 1980s and it has
 been gathering dust in their garage since then. It has 57,000 miles on the clock.

Mr Hubbard added: 'This kind of model is different to a model such as the 250, which people will buy to use for parts.

'It is rare to find a 330GT so somebody will I'm sure want to restore the car to its former glory.

'There has been interest in this car already, with three or four telephone bidders lined up.

'Cars like this do not come to the market very often.

'The owners came to the realisation that it had been sat in the garage not doing much for the last 20 years.

'They have a couple of vintage cars and are more interested in them than cars from the 1950s or 1960s so they have decided to let it go to somebody who wants to work on it.'

The Ferrari will go to auction at the Bonhams' Harrogate sale on November 14.
