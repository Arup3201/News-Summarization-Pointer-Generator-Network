David Cameron was drawn into a row over offensive football chants yesterday as he defended Tottenham Hotspur fans who shout the word ‘Yid’.

The Prime Minister revealed that he thought supporters of the North London club should not face prosecution for chanting the terms ‘Yiddos’ and ‘Yid army’ at games because they are jokingly referring to themselves and therefore not ‘motivated by hate’.

But he said other people should be discouraged from using the term, because of the offence it could cause.

His view directly contradicts the official stance of the Football Association, which has issued a statement warning Spurs fans that using the words could result in a banning order or even lead to criminal charges.

His say: Cameron believes fans who used the word should not be prosecuted, unless it is used in hatred

Support: Tottenham fans will face no action for chanting the word 'Yid' last weekend

For
years, Tottenham supporters have been on the receiving end of 
anti-Semitic abuse from opposition fans – as the club has long had a 
Jewish following.

In an 
act of defiance, some started using the word ‘Yid’ themselves and chants
of ‘Yids’, ‘Yid army’ and ‘Yiddos’ are regularly heard coming from the 
home stands at White Hart Lane.

Mr Cameron told The Jewish Chronicle that it was wrong for people to use the word in a derogatory sense.

Yid is probably short for Yiddish, the German-influenced language spoken since medieval times by people from the Jewish diaspora in central and eastern Europe.

The word derives from German word Jude, meaning Jew, which is pronounced with an initial Y sound.

It was first recorded in English in 1874, when it was included in a dictionary of London slang.

Since the Second World War the word has been used by Jewish authors, often to portray antisemitic speech.

Some Jewish groups say the term is offensive all of the time.

But
he added: ‘There’s a difference between Spurs fans self-describing 
themselves as Yids and someone calling someone a Yid as an insult.

‘You have to be motivated by hate. Hate speech should be prosecuted – but only when it’s motivated by hate.’

However
the Football Association said the word was ‘derogatory and offensive’ 
and urged fans to refrain from using it on the terraces.

In
a statement last week the FA announced: ‘The use of the term “Yid” is 
likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer – and it 
considers the term to be inappropriate in a football setting.

‘The FA would encourage fans to avoid using it in any situation.’

The
statement finishes with a warning, which says: ‘Use of the term in a 
public setting could amount to a criminal offence, and leave those fans 
liable to prosecution and potentially a lengthy football banning order.’

The club has responded
to the FA by announcing that they plan to send a questionnaire to all 
season ticket holders asking if they think the practice should stop.

But
fans reacted defiantly to the statement, chanting ‘Yid army’ and ‘we’ll
sing what we want’ throughout their 2-0 win over Norwich. And Ellie 
Kershaw, a board member for Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust, 
insisted that Spurs fans have reclaimed the word, making it no longer 
offensive.

Last night a 
Number 10 spokesman said: ‘We would discourage anyone from using the 
term “Yid” given the historical associations of the term and the offence
that it could cause.

‘The
PM was asked about criminal prosecution and specifically whether people
who refer to themselves in this way should be prosecuted. 
Self-referring is clearly different to people using it as a term of 
abuse motivated by hatred.’

However
the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it backs the Football 
Association’s stance on the use of the word ‘Yid’ – as many see any use 
of the word as an anti-Semitic form of abuse.

And
Jewish Chelsea fan Danny Finkelstein, a former adviser to Mr Cameron, 
said he disagreed with the Prime Minister’s stance. He told BBC Radio 
4’s PM programme: ‘This is an insulting word and when I take my children
to a game with Spurs it is so disturbing to have Chelsea fans react to 
this chant with racist insults.

‘I
don’t think Spurs Jews have control of the term in the way they think 
they do. In addition it makes me very uncomfortable to see so many 
non-Jews use this phrase.’

Hitting back: Comedian David Baddiel, pictured with his wife Morwenna Banks, said only a small minority of Tottenham fans are Jewish

Jewish comedian David Baddiel has spoken out against the chants, insisting that using the word ‘Yid’ is unacceptable – and that only a minority of Spurs fans are actually Jewish.

Mr Baddiel said Tottenham fans’ argument that they are ‘reclaiming’ the term is illogical as the club’s Jewish association has long been considered outdated.

He claimed that fewer than five per cent of those in the ground at home games are now Jewish.

‘There are only 250,000 Jews in Britain as a whole and I’d say that about three or four per cent of Tottenham’s crowd is Jewish,’ he said.

‘That means that well over 90 per cent of those chanting “Yid Army” are not actually Jewish  – and that is just one of several reasons why it cannot be right.’

He added: ‘At Tottenham, the club’s “Jewishness” is just a historical association with the area.

‘It’s doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual Jews in the ground at home games.

‘So the argument “But it is just like Snoop Doggy Dogg using the N-word” does not apply to most of the Spurs fans.’ Mr Baddiel, a Chelsea supporter, who made a film about the issue last year for campaign group Kick Racism Out Of Football, said Spurs fans’ use of the term encouraged other teams’ supporters to use it in a more derogatory sense.

‘It’s a call and response dynamic, like many at football matches,’ he wrote on the Guardian website.

‘So the more Spurs do it, the more it comes back, with menaces. Many Chelsea fans who I have challenged feel they are justified because “the Yids is what Spurs call themselves”.’

He added: ‘The thing to remember about Yid is it’s a race-hate word. It was daubed across the East End by Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts, along with the word “out”.

‘The only possible reason why a culture that has tried to dismiss other race-hate words to the margins of language would consider it acceptable is if the racism of which it is a part is somehow less offensive, somehow less significant, than other racisms.

‘Which must be, I guess, what a lot of people consciously or unconsciously think – if it had been the N-word or the P-word, it wouldn’t have got past David Cameron’s lips.’
