Fabrice Muamba is taking initial steps to become a coach after putting on sessions at Liverpool.

Muamba, 26, retired from football after collapsing on the pitch following a cardiac arrest during Bolton’s FA Cup game away to Tottenham in March 2012.

He is now taking his coaching badges and has been invited to help out at Liverpool.

Muamba's career was cut short when he suffered cardiac arrest on the pitch in March 2012

Coach Of Liverpool U21s Michael Beale said: 'Fabrice came in to do a talk for the Premier League about his situation and how he progressed from a young player right through to recovering from his near-fatal accident.

'I was so taken aback by Fabrice’s enthusiasm and I spoke with him. Fabrice is friends with our physio, Andy Renshaw, from his Bolton days and he is starting his coaching badges.

'We invited Fabrice in and his personality has lit up the Academy in the days that he comes in, and he was with us this week watching our Chelsea game.'

Muamba received support from football fans all over the country, including at Liverpool
