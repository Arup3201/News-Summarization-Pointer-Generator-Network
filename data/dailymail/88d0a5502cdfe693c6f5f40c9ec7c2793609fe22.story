A rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers' everyday life in the First World War 100 years after fighting began.

The 70 images, taken by press and army photographers on the Western Front, were used as positive propaganda back home - but rarely for war material of the time, most were not posed or staged.

Instead they showed the everyday activities of soldiers in the harsh conditions of the trenches, including servicemen attaching a message to a collie dog which would have been used to deliver messages through No Man's Land.

Poignant: A rare set of original prints has cast light on soldiers' everyday life in the First World War 100 years after fighting began. In one, soldiers attach a message to a collie dog which would then be sent through No Man's Land. They would not have been spared by German snipers, but were small and quick enough to avoid them

The first mechanised war: The photos depict everyday scenes near the Western front, including hundreds of 2ft artillery shells lined up neatly ready for battle

Bleak: The photographs were used as propaganda to encourage more men to enlist in the army back in Britain, but unlike many, they were not staged or posed

Muddy: Another one of the photographs showed mules being used to pull horses out of a bog after they became stuck. Conditions in winter were harsh

Dogs were used not because the enemy would spare them - they would have been shot dead like everyone else - but because they were small and quick enough to avoid snipers' bullets.

Among them are images of troops braving the freezing winter months in their fortified trenches at stations in France and Belgium soon after war broke out in summer 1914.

One shot shows a ‘shell dump’, where 2ft tall artillery shells were stored in their hundreds, while another shows soldiers manning rudimentary machine gun posts.

In another, a Tommy loads a rocket onto a wooden launching pole which would then be fired to announce to impending attacks.

Some were not so positive: a particularly grim shot shows mules pulling horses from a muddy bog in which they had become stuck.

Convenient: British foot soldiers pass through a hole in a wall, which handily has been blasted out for them by a previous shell. Few cameras were on the front line

No peace on the horizon: Soldiers using range-finding techniques. The 70 photographs are original prints which would have been made from glass negatives

Everyday work of war: Soldiers reinforcing a trench (left) and hanging telegraph wires from a tree branch (right). Communication was everything in the high-tech war

Remains: The wreckage of a German field gun. What the images do not capture is the unprecedented violence of the world's first fully mechanised war

Just like home: Key trenches were wide enough to take horses and carts, and soldiers would add the names of London streets to make them more familiar

Some of the images carry a ‘press’ stamp on the back, and experts - who expect the collection to sell for £3,000 at an auction next week - say the rest were likely to have been taken by official army photographers.

Although they were seen at the time, as part of a recruitment drive to show troops 'enjoying' life in the trenches, many have not been seen in years since and some may never have been seen publicly at all.

The prints were made from original glass negatives and are being sold in six lots by auctioneers Onslows next Wednesday in Blandford, Dorset.

For 40 years they were owned by an anonymous memorabilia collector from Dorset who has amassed one of the country's finest collections of photographs, documents and medals from the Great War.

Now in his mid-60s, the man - who is not a veteran - acquired the photographs in a single collection by advertising in the classified columns of newspapers and magazines, including the Daily Telegraph and Private Eye.

Lunchtime! Soldiers eating rations. The comparatively primitive cameras of the day had trouble capturing quick movements due to their long exposure times

Bitter: Much of the fighting happened in the dead of winter, as evidenced by the starkly naked trees which line this procession of allied troops

Captured: A German gun emplacement. In the great battles of the First World War, advances of even a few feet were won at the cost of thousands of lives

Camp: Soldiers walk across an improvised bridge in freezing conditions. The owner of the photographs obtained them by placing classified newspaper adverts

Improvising: Soldiers had to do what they could in grim conditions - which included everyday chores. Here they dry their clothes on a bombed-out agricultural site

He decided to sell much of his collection in several sales by Onslows to mark the centenary of the outbreak of war.

Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'Photographs from World War One are very rare, especially those taken on the Western Front. These photos are being sold by a private collector who has spent the last 40 years compiling artefacts from the First World War.

'He bought these photos in a job lot of around 70 pieces. They are original copy prints which makes them incredibly rare. Some have been taken by press photographers and come with a stamp of the news organisation on the back.

'But others don’t have any stamp, which would suggest they were taken by the army’s own photographers.

'The point of the photographs was to portray the war in a good light and to convince more men to enlist. The few photos that were taken on the Western Front were often posed by the soldiers, but these are real life pictures which makes them all the more poignant.'

Hard at work: A machine gun emplacement. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'Photographs from World War One are very rare, especially those taken on the Western Front'

On the march: Not all the troops involved in fighting were British - here, soldiers from overseas saluted their own top brass during an event near the front line

Visitors: Many of the photographs, including this one, came with no captions, leaving their origins mysterious

Bleak: With waters almost down to freezing point, even the job of filling a Dixie can was an arduous one. The photographs tried to portray the war in a positive light

Unavoidable: Even though they were meant to be positive, the grim reality of war could not be evaded. Cart horses struggled and slipped in icy conditions, pictured
