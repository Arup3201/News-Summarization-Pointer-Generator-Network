The elixir of dermatological youth has now arrived on earth - in London's Mayfair, to be more precise - and its makers claim it can banish wrinkles in just 12 minutes.

What's more, after around ten sessions, the effects will last for years.

That's according to Spa Illuminata, which is now offering a new radio frequency treatment called Efficy, made by skincare specialists Germaine de Capuccini.

On the face, the treatment can be used to repair deep lines and wrinkles, reduce double chins or attack lines and puffiness round the eyes.

Efficy in action: The cutting-edge treatment uses a single electrode

It can also reduce fat, cellulite and fluid retention and increase smoothing and tightening on the body.

The cutting-edge non-invasive equipment incorporates three technologies in one treatment. Digital monopolar radio-frequency creates heat which stimulates the production of connective tissue in the dermis (the thick layer of living tissue below the top thin layer of skin); vacuum push-pull technology creates lymphatic drainage and digital transdermal introduction targets specific layers of the skin.

Unlike most radio frequency treatments, which use bi-polar or tri-polar technology, the Efficy machine uses digital mono-polar technology, which means there's only one electrode.

What's the advantage? 'There is no unnecessary flow of current through the body,' explains Gina Baker at Germaine de Capuccini.

'Efficy creates 
retraction of collagen fibres, which produces a flash smoothing effect on 
the skin’s surface giving instant results.'

Before: Visible lines appear on the forehead

After: 12 minutes later the head is smoother

'It also provides 
activation of the heat shock proteins restoring the balance of the 
dermis, stimulating the production of new supporting connective tissue and 
reorganising the dermal structure, making it thicker and reducing 
wrinkles,' she says.

'The treatment increases the production of 
elastin, hyaluronic acid and collagen too, which strengthen the 
dermis.

'By producing greater blood flow, Efficy nourishes and oxygenates the dermis, 
while increasing liquid and toxin drainage,' she adds. The drainage specifically helps with the treatment of double chins and puffiness 
in the eye contour.

The new treatment combines three technologies in one

For the body, the machine works
 by fluidifying fat. 'The fatty tissue presents great resistance to the 
flow of current, increasing lipolysis [fat breakdown],' Gina explains.

They claim results
 are seen from the very first session - in as little as 12 minutes. To create a long-lasting effect, approximately five to 15 sessions are recommended  for the 
face and between 10 and 20 for the body, depending on the condition treated.

Dermotologist Dr Ravi Jain explains, 'Radio frequency is great for people who don't want needles and don't want downtime, but it's not a panacea for everyone.

'If there's already sun damage or loss of elasticity it's unlikely to be as effective. It's usually used more as a prevention that a correction. 

Commenting on the 12-minute claim Dr Jain says, 'All radio frequency treatment tends to give people that healthy glow straight away, but the real measure of how effective it is is how they look a month down the line.'

Alla Higgs, treatment manager at Spa Illuminata says, ‘Despite working deep into the skin, the treatment is not painful so patients can still feel relaxed.'

Following an in-depth consultation the therapist uses a programme tailored to suit individual needs.
