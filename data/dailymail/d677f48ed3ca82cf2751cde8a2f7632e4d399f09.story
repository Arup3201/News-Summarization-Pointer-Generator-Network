A university is probing claims that some of its Muslim students are enforcing segregation between men and women, it emerged today.

Leicester University spoke of its concerns over photos showing hand-written signs requesting that male and female students sit in separate areas at a public talk by the university’s Islamic Society.

The meeting - which discussed God’s existence - was addressed by Islamic speaker Hamza Tzortzis, who speaks at various campuses and was involved in controversy at another university last month.

As reported by MailOnline, University College London banned his Islamic Education & Research Academy group from its campus after the organisation tried to segregate men and women during a debate.

The latest incident in Leicester saw A4 sheets of paper attached to an entrance door with the words ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ and arrows pointing in opposite directions, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The University of Leicester Islamic Society’s website also said in a separate notice that meetings are open to the public, but it has ‘segregated seating for brothers and sisters at all co-attended events’.

Leicester University officials told the Daily Telegraph that they would investigate the signs in the photos and ensure that nobody will be forced to sit apart in the future - unless it is their preference.

A spokesman for Mr Tzortzis’s group said genders were sometimes informally segregated at events.

But he added that signs did not intend to ‘enforce’ separation - and that there were rarely any problems if non-Muslims chose to ignore the advice on where to sit.

'It is a little bit of a storm in a 
teacup. It is down to a bit of a 
misunderstanding about the way that Islam is perceived'

‘It is a little bit of a storm in a teacup,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It is down to a bit of a misunderstanding about the way that Islam is perceived.’

Last month the segregation of men and women at the UCL event was halted only when one speaker, U.S. scientist Lawrence Krauss, walked out.

Ignoring the jeering audience, he told an organiser: ‘Either you quit the segregation or I’m not interested.’

He objected after three people were removed from the room because they complained when they were told that only men or couples were allowed to sit at the front, with single women at the back.

He returned when staff allowed men and women to mix.

The public debate between atheist Mr Krauss and Greek Islamic convert Hamza Tzortzis was on the subject of ‘Islam or Atheism: Which Makes More Sense?’

UCL later issued a statement saying the iERA would not be allowed to hold events on its grounds again.

Audience
 member Dana Sondergaard wrote on her Facebook page: ‘After watching 
three people be kicked out of the auditorium . . . Dr Krauss bravely 
defended his beliefs of gender equality.’

The iERA later claimed the women had segregated themselves through choice.
