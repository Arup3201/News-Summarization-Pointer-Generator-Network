Robert Wilson, 28, was savagely attacked by four men outside a Co-op and suffered horrific injuries

A victim of a horrific assault who was stabbed through the face with a glass bottle has said the ordeal has 'ruined his life.' 

Robert Wilson, 28, was attacked by four men outside a Co-op and suffered a broken cheekbone and scars to his face and head.

He woke in a hospital bed with his face covered in blood and his eyes so swollen he could not open them. 

Mr Wilson may never feel the right side of his face again following surgery to insert a metal plate behind his right eye.

Recalling the assault outside a Portsmouth Co-op on August 31 last year, he said: 'They all just steamed into me with bottles and I hit the floor.

'They all jumped on my head, beating me on the head. I felt kicks in my face and then I was knocked out.

'While I was knocked out they stole my trainers and I was stabbed through the face with a glass bottle.

'I woke up about five hours later in hospital and when I woke up my eyes were swelled shut.

'I didn't know what had happened - I thought I was blind. I couldn't feel my face and I didn't know whether it was a dream or not.

Jack Sharpe, 27, from Portsmouth, was jailed for five years and three months

'The nurses said I had been horrifically attacked. My cheekbone was broken and my eye socket had fallen into my cheek.'

The group who committed the attack, Harry Sharpe, 23, George Claridge, 27, Kenny Deacon, 25, and Jack Sharpe, 27, from Portsmouth, were jailed for a total for 17 years and three months between them after they admitted causing grievous bodily harm.

Claridge, Harry Sharpe and Deacon  were each sentenced to four years in jail.

Jack Sharpe was jailed for five years and three months. He was also convicted of possession with intent to supply a class A drug at Portsmouth Crown Court.

Shockingly, Mr Wilson had known the men for most of his life and fears they could strike again. 

He said: 'If they can do that to me what can they do to someone else?

'I don't really trust people any more. Even the nurse said they didn't know how I survived. There was blood everywhere.

'I've had to move. I don't want to be in Portsmouth any more as I get anxious and the worry has made my mum ill.

'It was horrendous. It's ruined my life and it's going to affect me for ever.'

The severity of the attack meant Mr Wilson had to wait about two-and-a-half months for surgery.

He added: 'I've got a metal plate underneath my eye to hold my eye in place. Part of my face fills up with fluid.

'I'm just constantly reminded of it every time I wake up. My face feels terrible and I don't really get a chance to forget it.'
