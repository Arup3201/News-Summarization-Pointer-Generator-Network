Tony Blair’s appearance at the Leveson Inquiry was dramatically interrupted yesterday when a protester burst in to the chamber and accused him of being a ‘war criminal’.

The former prime minister was giving evidence when 49-year-old David Lawley-Wakelin emerged through a doorway behind Lord Justice Leveson. He shouted: ‘This man should be arrested for war crimes’, gesturing to  Mr Blair.

Mr Lawley-Wakelin claimed that Mr Blair had been ‘bought’ by JP Morgan, and that the US investment bank had profited from the Iraq War.

After the protester was bundled out, a furious Lord Justice Leveson demanded an inquiry into how he had managed to reach ‘what is supposed to be a secure corridor’. Shortly afterwards a cheerful Mr Lawley-Wakelin was marched out of the court and into a van by police officers. He was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours.

A second man was also held after an egg was thrown at Mr Blair's Range Rover as he left the High Court following his evidence.

The dramatic earlier disruption echoed that of Jonnie Marbles who thrust a custard pie into Rupert Murdoch's face during his evidence to a Commons Select Committee last year, provoking wife Wendi Deng to athletically leap to the mogul's defence.

Filmmaker and veteran Iraq-War protester Lawley-Wakelin, 49, who said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry, shouted to a stunned courtroom: 'JP Morgan paid him off for the Iraq war. Three months after he invaded Iraq they held up the Iraq bank for 20 billion.

'He was then paid six million dollars every year and still is from JP Morgan six months after he left office. This man is a war criminal.'

Embarrassing: David Lawley-Wakelin, dressed in a white shirt and chinos, then shouted to the stunned court, 'This man should be arrested for war crimes'

'Completely untrue': After peace was restored to the courtroom, Mr Blair told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue'

The drama began when Mr Lawley-Wakelin burst in, having managed to get past security to access the private corridor into courtroom 73.

As chief counsel Robert Jay QC, who had been leading Blair's grilling, held his head in his hands, security guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of the chamber.

Mr Blair, who is a senior adviser at JP Morgan on a reported salary of between £500,000 and £2.5million, immediately told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue'.

Protester: David Lawley-Wakelin was arrested but it wasn't his first Blair protest. He also interrupted a debate on the Iraq War on BBC's Question Time

Quizzed: David Lawley-Wakelin was taken to a central London police station for questioning

Arrested: David Lawley-Wakelin said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry as he was escorted from the Royal Courts of Justice

Police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin

The father of two, a fierce opponent of the war on Iraq, has publicly heckled Mr Blair before, during an episode of the BBC’s Question Time.

A freelance documentary filmmaker, he is separated from his wife Angela and lives alone in Notting Hill.

After his release yesterday, he said the security at the inquiry was so lax that he was able to walk straight in through the back. ‘I tried to get in through the front entrance but they stopped me. I figured Leveson himself would enter a different way so I walked around, found an empty court and went through the back door of it.

It was not the first televised anti-Blair protest by David Lawley-Wakelin.

The filmmaker and veteran Iraq-War protester launched a similar attack during an episode of Question Time on the BBC (pictured above).

Posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone, he yelled: 'This country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil.' His outburst was met with rapturous applause.

He later travelled to Iraq to make a short film in which he claimed 'to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him'.

The Alternative Iraq Enquiry then asks: 'Should Tony Blair be taken to the Hague and tried for crimes against peace?'

Following a screening of the film at the Frontline Club in west London in 2010, he led a debate with former Labour MP Clare Short and Major General Tim Cross, who was commander of the British Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

According to the Internet Movie Database, the film and TV professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of Time Team - hosted by Tony Robinson - and a first assistant director on a 2010 Everest documentary entitled The Wildest Dream.

He is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called Saint Dracula 3D.

On his Facebook page, under the section entitled 'political views', he writes: 'Blair and at least four of his cronies should be behind bars...'

He once also appeared with anti-Iraq war MP George Galloway in a TalkSport radio show last year.

‘I walked around and managed to find Leveson’s personal chamber.There was no one there so I just went straight in.’

Mr Lawley-Wakelin said it was yesterday morning that he had decided to make his gesture on the ‘spur of the moment’. He added: ‘For evil to carry on it just takes for good men to do nothing. Whenever Blair is in public, there I’ll be.’

Lord Justice Leveson said he wanted an investigation into how the man got into the court through special access, security-coded doors.

He said: 'I would like to find out how this gentleman managed to access the court through what's supposed to be a secure corridor and I'll have an investigation undertaken about that immediately.'

Mr Blair said: 'That's fine, can I just say for the record that what he said about Iraq and JP Morgan is completely untrue.'

The man told reporters his name was David Lawley-Wakelin and he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry, He spoke as security guards escorted him through the Royal Courts of Justice.

When the hearing resumed for the afternoon session, Lord Leveson said: 'Considerable effort has been put into ensuring all witnesses can give their evidence in a safe and secure environment and I very much regret what has happened.

'An investigation is being undertaken and I will be giving consideration to the steps that can be taken and should be taken against this particular intruder.

'Efforts will be redoubled to ensure that incidents of this nature don't recur.

'I repeat my apologies to Mr Blair and indeed to everyone else who was involved in or following our inquiry.'

Mr Blair had been greeted by around two dozen or so protesters as he arrived at the courts.

They waved banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out'.

The close relationship between Mr Blair and Rupert Murdoch was underlined by a list of contacts with newspaper editors and proprietors in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003.

Three telephone calls were recorded between the pair on  11, 13 and 19 March 2003. He admitted to initiating one of them and that they lasted for now more than 45 minutes in total.

He said: ‘I would have been wanting to explain what we are doing. I think I had similar calls with the Observer and the Telegraph. I don't think there's anything particularly odd about that when you're facing such an issue.’

In the run up to the 1997 general election in which Mr Blair took power for the first time, The Sun famously switched its allegiance from the Tory Party and became a vociferous cheerleader for the Iraq War.

Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry.

Arrested: A second man was also held after an egg was thrown at Mr Blair's Range Rover as he left the High Court following his appearance before Lord Justice Leveson

Echoes: The interruption was an embarrassing echo of the 'custard pie' incident when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during a Commons Select Committee last year and his wife, Wendi Deng, leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker

Arriving in a black Range Rover at around 8.30am - a good hour and a half before the scheduled kick off - he waved at the assembled bank of press photographers as he entered through a side door of the London court.

But outside the main entrance, the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling.

Waving banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out', they greeted the former Prime Minister with an angry reception.

Protest: Waving banners reading 'Troops home', 'Bliar' and 'Afghanistan out', about a dozen protesters greeted the former Prime Minister when he arrived at the hearing

Angry: Shouts of 'traitor' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up

Furious: Outside the main entrance, the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling

Mary Macmillan, a Fabian from Soho in London, carried a large knitted puppet of a judge bearing a sign on its chest reading 'Blair the day of judgment.'

The 78-year-old said: 'I was a 1997 Labour Party person when Blair got his majority and I'm afraid he's proved a great let-down.

'We got very few things that he promised. The war in Afghanistan is the greatest treachery.

'I'm glad we could get here today because it's very difficult to get hold of Blair.'

Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry

Anti-war artist Chris Holden, 69, from London, repeated the familiar argument that the Iraq war - Blair's most controversial act in office - had been 'for the oil'.

He asked: 'Why can't they just come out and say (it?)'

Shouts of 'traitor' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up.

'Truth and justice is the central message', Mr Holden said.

But 'justice' for the perceived wrongs of the Iraq war was not on the bill for yesterday's hearing about Blair's relationship with the media.
