Her best friend Ollie Locke may be better known for his glowing tan, but nonetheless, Binky Felstead has joined forces with Rimmel to showcase the brand's new range.

The Made In Chelsea star has been unveiled as the star of its new Sunshimmer advertising campaign.

Rimmel London say that the BAFTA award-winning star of E4's show brings her 'true British flair and glamour' to the brand.

Speaking about her new gig, Binky said: 'I was absolutely thrilled when asked to be a part of the new  campaign. 

'Tanning is an essential part of my beauty regime. I've always loved Rimmel and Sunshimmer’s Instant Tan is a great way to get a sun-kissed glow at home.'

The brand say that, as a girl about town, Binky epitomises Rimmel's 'cool and eclectic' London style.

Binky, who has her own beauty blog, will feature across print, online and in-store advertising and joins the likes of Kate Moss, Rita Ora and Georgia May Jagger who are also Rimmel ambassadors.

Binky showcases her svelte new figure in the campaign imagery, the result of her time at No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, where she recently stayed before a Dubai holiday.

She lost 6lbs during the fitness blitz aimed at getting her bikini body in tip top shape, slimming down to 8st 7lbs - her ideal weight - with help from the military trainers.

But Binky's svelte new figure didn't come without hard work. As a resident of the notoriously hardcore boot camp, she was awoken every morning at at 7am by loud music to do activities such as tyre flipping, circuits, and beach workouts.

Then she would have a specially prepared breakfast before embarking on two hour long sessions of cross, circuit and high intensity interval training - judging by her latest photo shoot, it was worth it!

When it comes to working for the Stalwart make-up brand, Binky is in very good company of course.

British pop star Rita Ora recently launched her range of cosmetics with the brand and Supermodel Kate Moss has long been a Rimmel London ambassador.
