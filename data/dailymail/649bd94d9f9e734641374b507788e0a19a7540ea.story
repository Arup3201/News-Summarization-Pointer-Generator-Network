Emile Heskey believes newly-appointed Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has a 'decent squad to work with' after taking over the reins at the Premier League strugglers. 

Sherwood was announced as the new manager of Aston Villa on Saturday just three days after Paul Lambert's dismissal from his role at Villa Park.

Aston Villa are currently languishing in 18th spot in the Premier League, however Heskey believes Sherwood has enough quality at his disposal to steer his former side away from the relegation zone.

Heskey plied his trade at Aston Villa for three years between 2009 and 2012

Heskey, speaking to the Sunday Mirror, said: 'The new manager will have a decent squad to work with. There are international players there - that says it all. 

'They have good quality, they are fairly young and have good legs on them. It is just finding the right blend and formula that fits with the players you have got. 

 'Villa fans are like most - give them something to cheer about and they will get behind you. At the moment there hasn't been anything to write home about.'

Aston Villa's biggest problem so far this season has been their inability to score goals. The Midlands outfit have scored just 12 goals in the Premier League - with star striker Christian Benteke failing to hit the back of the net in his last six games. 

Heskey believes one of Sherwood's main tasks will be to get the best out of the Belgium international after his recent dip in form.

The Bolton forward added: 'In Christian Benteke they also have somebody who can get goals for them, and part of the job for the new manager will be helping him get through this little spell when, for whatever reason, it hasn't been happening.'
