Prosecutors in the case of the New York City police officer charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women want jurors in the upcoming February trial to learn about the explicit online chats in which he detailed his cannibal desires.

According to court papers 'Cannibal cop' Gilberto Valle, was told by an online friend by the name of 'Moody Blues' that human flesh 'isn't quite like pork, but very meaty anyway' and that he'd previously eaten a 'black woman and a white child.'

The disgraced NYPD officer - who has claimed he hasn't ever eaten anyone before - replied 'Excellent', reveal records at the Manhattan federal court released today.

Valle, 28, is charged with plotting to kidnap, torture, cook and eat at least 100 women and prosecutors also want jurors in his trial to hear of this online exchange between 'Moody Blues', who is based abroad and Valle.

'If we get someone..and we finish the meat early, would you go for another?' wrote 'Moody Blues'.

'Yeah. I think we would have to give it time though,' replies Valle.

'Why? Go for a completely different type. I'd love to eat another child,' countered 'Moody Blues.'

In addition to the gruesome messaging, court papers note that 'Moody Blues' wrote to Valle that 'I also love roasting whole pelvises, mind you only did with the little one so far.'

Prosecutors revealed the chilling messages in response to Valle's legal team and their attempts to bar introduction of evidence 'in which Moody Blues appears to recount times in his past he has cannabilized children.'

Valle's defense team has said that 'Moody Blues''hyperbolic and twisted recanting of prior instances of cannibalization are either irrelevant, exceedingly prejudicial, or both,' and are 'only unrelated claims of Moody Blues' repugnant prior acts.

'Mr. Valle never engages in the conversation on this subject with Moody Blues other than to usher the conversation away from the matter and into sexual fantasies about Which Mr. Valle finds arousing -- all of which have to do with adults,' public defenders Julia Gatto and Christopher Flood wrote.

However, federal prosecutors have insisted in court that the exchanges are not 'unfairly prejudicial' and are 'highly probabtive of Valle's state of mind and of the existence of an actual, and non-fantastical agreement between Valle and the co-conspirator to commit a kidnapping.'

'Indeed , they are no more sensational, depraved and disturbing than the related portions of the conversations (which Valle concedes are admissible) about shoving a specific and identified woman into an oven, with her legs folded under her, or cooking her over an open fire, slowly, to prolong her suffering,' prosecutors Hadassa Waxman and Randall Jackson wrote.

Prosecutors also made the point that Valle as a police officer, 'charged with knowing, and enforcing, the law', was 'voluntarily communicating with an individual who claimed to have murdered and eaten a child, and who desired to commit other murders with Valle.'

Valle who will go on trial next month is accused of scheming online with at least three people to adduct, rape, torture, cook and eat women he targeted using a police database.

The former police officer has said that he was engaging in a role-playing fantasy in his online chats.

Last week a federal appeals court denied bail for Valle after a prosecutor described how the suspect was allegedly salivating over the prospect of cooking a female friend.

'My mouth was watering the whole time,' Gilberto Valle allegedly told a friend on an online forum after he had lunch in Baltimore with a former college pal.

The disgraced NYPD cop later fantasized about slow-cooking and eating the woman, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said in court last Tuesday.

In online transcripts cited by NBC4 Valle at one point tells a co-conspirator that his oven is 'big enough to fit one of these girls if I folded their legs.'

'I was thinking of tying her body onto some kind of apparatus...cook her over a low heat, keep her alive as long as possible,' he is accused of saying in the July conversation.

Also on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe delayed the trial date. Now, jury selection will get under way February 11, with opening statements beginning on February 25.

Originally, the trial was scheduled for next Tuesday, but Valle's lawyers said they need extra time to prepare because being in prison has made it difficult for Valle to review nearly a million pages of evidence.

Defense attorney Julia Gatto said authorities had arranged for him to look at evidence on a computer during the day but he must be handcuffed while doing so.

He has been imprisoned since he was charged last fall with using a law enforcement database between last January and October 24 as he made plans to kidnap, rape, kill and eat women while communicating with others on a website devoted to the exploration of deviant sexual fantasies.

Defense lawyers have said all along he was engaging in sexual fantasies and intended no violence.

Last week, a 22-year-old Trenton, New Jersey, man Michael Van Hise, was charged in the case. He was accused of trying to hire Valle to kidnap a Manhattan woman that he could rape and kill.

He, like Valle, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy. Van Hise’s lawyer has said her client never intended to harm anyone and made that clear to investigators with whom he cooperated for several months before his arrest.

During Tuesday’s appeals arguments, defense attorney Edward Zas said Valle was just like 40,000 other people who go online to 'engage in the most heinous depraved chats but they are imaginary.'

Zas called the prosecution misguided and predicted Valle would be exonerated.

'He’s done nothing except imagine bad things and put them foolishly on the Internet in a very bad way,' Zas said. 'If there is just role playing...there is no crime at all. The only crime is in Mr. Valle’s imagination.'

And in the first week of January Valle's partner, NYPD officer Michael Van Hise, appeared in court for allegedly planning crimes against children in his own family.

Van Hise is alleged to have plotted to turn his three-year-old stepdaughter into a sex slave and offered his two nieces for rape on the internet.

Prosecutors told the court that Van Hise sent a photo of his wife’s seven-year-old niece to two people in an internet chat room, offering her and her nine-year-old sister for rape.

They also alleged Van Hise had similar plans for his own stepdaughter, whose identity has not been revealed for legal reasons.

He suggests that "there are three we can rape, et cetera ...,"' said federal prosecutor Randall Jackson said at Van Hise’s bail hearing yesterday, reported the New York Daily News.

Referring to the online message, posted on Yahoo.com, he added: 'The three-year-old (stepdaughter) he wants to keep as his sex slave.'

He allegedly also posted the street in Hamilton, New Jersey, on which the girls live, adding: 'We can engage in other activities [with them]', the court was told.

Mr Jackson said Van Hise told an FBI agent that he and Valle were 'serious' about their plans to kidnap and rape a woman before admitting he was sexually aroused around children.

Harrowing: He allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators

Van Hise's estranged wife, Bolise, 22, defended him as a 'big teddy bear', adding: 'They make him out to be a monster. He’s not. He’s as hard-core as a baby.'

The alleged plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan, 28, tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims.

In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator.

His defense maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer, who served in Harlem for six years.

Valle plead not guilty to all charges, including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims.
