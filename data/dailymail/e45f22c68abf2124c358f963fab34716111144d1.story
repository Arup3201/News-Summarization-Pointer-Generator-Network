A man suspected of violently kidnapping a woman from her Milwaukie workplace and forcing her into a minivan has been named by police.

The suspect has been identified from CCTV footage as Kelly Vern Swoboda, 49, and is considered armed and dangerous.

The victim, in her mid-20s, was kidnapped from her place of employment on Highway 99 in the Portland suburb – but amazingly managed to leap from the vehicle she had been forced into as it was moving along.

She was found injured by the side of the road by neighbors, who called an ambulance, according to Kgw.com.

Detectives were full of praise for the victim.

Lt. Robert Wurpes told the site: 'She fought back. And that's admirable. It worked in this case, you know, never give up.'

A worker from a nearby shop said: ‘It's really scary. I mean, my brother brought me mace today.

‘It really makes me think of going and getting my gun handlers permit. It’s just scary that it’s so close to home.’

Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said that members of the public should immediately dial 911 if they spot Swoboda, who is at large.

The victim was working alone when the
 suspect walked into the business, physically assaulted her, and forced 
her outside and into a minivan, police said.

A statement described him as ‘an adult male around age 50, with gray hair, wire-rimmed glasses and a goatee or beard, wearing a dark navy-blue hooded jacket and driving a purple-colored minivan’.

The statement added: ‘Stranger-on-stranger abductions are extremely rare, and detectives are taking this case very seriously. This is an open and ongoing investigation.’
