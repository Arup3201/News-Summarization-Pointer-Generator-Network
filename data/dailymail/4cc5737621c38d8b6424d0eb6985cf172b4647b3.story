Taxpayers, including the hostages held at gunpoint by the self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis, may have to foot the bill for his funeral arrangements if no one comes forward to claim his body.

The autopsy on Monis, who was killed when his 16-hour siege at Sydney's Lindt Cafe in Martin Place came to a violent end on Tuesday morning, is expected to be finished by Friday, but his body remains in the morgue and has yet to be claimed.

The bodies of his two victims, Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34, were released to their families on Thursday night.

If no next of kin come forward to claim the body of Man Haron Monis, taxpayers will have to foot the bill for his funeral and burial arrangements

It comes as Sydney's head Islamic funeral director said no Muslim funeral home will accept the body of  Man Haron Monis, suggesting instead that authorities dump his body at sea.

When asked about the fate of the 50-year old extremists body, Amin Sayed, the funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association, told Daily Telegraph: 'We don't care about him, we don't know him, chuck him in the bloody s***house.'

'Nobody's going to do his funeral. No Muslim funeral home will accept him,' he said.

'They can throw him in the bloody sea.'

Mr Sayed said Monis would receive a secret funeral with an unmarked grave, and that they would not accept any amount of money to arrange his funeral.

'Anyone who does harm to Australians, we don't want him,' he said. 

Following a coroner request, a forensic pathologist will carry an autopsy on his body.

The autopsy on gunman Monis began on Thursday and could be completed as early as Friday

But a NSW Health spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Local health districts are responsible for the processing and payment of destitute burials and cremations in their district.

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state.

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state is ultimately responsible for their burial, the local health district will fund a funeral.'

Monis's wife Amirah Droudis is responsible for the funeral arrangements, 

No Muslim can be denied a holy funeral unless they renounce their faith before their death.
