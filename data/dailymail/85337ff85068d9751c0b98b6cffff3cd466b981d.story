GCHQ now concentrates on the ‘darkest places’ of the internet inhabited by ‘the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles’, its outgoing head stressed yesterday.

Its staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploited the so-called ‘dark web’, Sir Iain Lobban said.

Sir Iain, who retires this month after six years in charge, also insisted Britain’s electronic eavesdropping agency did not engage in ‘anything remotely resembling mass surveillance’.

While he acknowledged that tracking down perpetrators online meant accessing the internet ‘at scale’, he said his organisation was committed to delivering security while protecting privacy to the ‘greatest extent possible’.

His comments come after a turbulent year for the intelligence agency, overshadowed by the disclosures of the former US intelligence operative Edward Snowden.

GCHQ has also come under criticism after it was revealed earlier this year they are allowed to spy on British citizens’ use of Facebook, Google and Twitter without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas.

Speaking at the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall, Sir Iain issued an impassioned defence of its work, while paying tribute to his staff, some of whom he said had made ‘the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty’ - although he gave no further details.

Referring to his staff, he added: ‘The people who work at GCHQ would sooner walk out the door than be involved in anything remotely resembling ‘mass surveillance’.

‘My staff are the embodiment of British values, not a threat to them.’

GCHQ and its American counterpart, the NSA, came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic after Mr Snowden leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities.

After Mr Snowden revealed GCHQ was gathering millions of pieces of data on British citizens, Sir Iain was forced to defend his organisation to MPs in an unprecedented public hearing.

In the hearing before the government’s Intelligence and Security Committee, alongside the heads of MI5 and MI6, he claimed terrorists had started changing their tactics because of Mr Snowden’s revelations.

Yesterday Sir Iain sought to underline the scale of the challenge facing the agencies - describing the ‘enormous exodus’ to the internet as ‘the biggest migration in human history’.

He said that only a small percentage of all the emails, texts and images sent globally were within reach of GCHQ’s sensors - of which only a small percentage were actually intercepted.

But he acknowledged the volumes were still large. He said: ‘We access the internet at scale so as to dissect it with surgical precision. Practically, it is now impossible to operate successfully in any other way.

‘You can’t pick and choose the components of a global interception system that you like - catching terrorists and paedophiles - and those you don’t - incidental collection of data at scale: it’s one integrated system.’

With the ‘vast majority’ of such criminal threats to the UK coming from groups or individuals based abroad, Sir Iain said strong intelligence and cyber capabilities were needed to identify and - where they were beyond the reach of international law enforcement - directly disrupt them.

He said: “We all now know that the beautiful dream of the Internet as a totally ungoverned space was just that – a beautiful dream. Like all utopian visions, it was flawed because it failed to account for the persistence of the worst aspects of human nature.

Sir Iain said his organisation was committed to delivering security while ensuring privacy to the 'greatest extent possible'

'Alongside the blessings – the comprehensive information, the communities of interest, the commercial opportunities and efficiencies – there are the plotters, the proliferators and the paedophiles. From what we know of ungoverned spaces in the real world, do we really believe that the world would be a better place if the Internet becomes an ungoverned space where anybody can act freely with impunity?”

He added: ‘Those who would do us harm don’t want to be found. They use certain routers or applications to hide in the darkest places of the internet.

‘We have to enter that labyrinth to find them. We work to crack their defences. We have to understand what adversaries seek to do to us and dedicate ourselves to preventing them from realising their plans.’

He stressed that the ‘core’ of GCHQ’s mission was ‘the protection of liberty, not the erosion of it’ and that it actively sought to minimise intrusion into people’s everyday lives.

He added: ‘By definition, the acquisition, aggregation, usage, sharing and retention of information involve varying degrees of interference with, or intrusion into, the privacy rights of individuals.

‘So those activities can only be undertaken if judged to be necessary in the interests of our statutory purposes - national security, economic well-being or the prevention and detection of serious crime - and proportionate in what we seek to achieve.’

GCHQ was formed in 1919 and employed Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing in the Second World War.
