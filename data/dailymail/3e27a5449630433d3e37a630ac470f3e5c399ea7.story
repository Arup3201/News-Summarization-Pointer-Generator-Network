The BBC’s comedy chief used £120 of public money to buy cupcakes for his staff, it emerged today.

Shane Allen, who is paid a salary of £207,000, claimed the money back for 48 cakes last year.

He also claimed expenses for taxis after watching comedy shows, hosting leaving drinks and buying comedy DVDs.

The details of the spending emerged as the BBC released a slew of expense claims by executives.

The revelations come as the Corporation faces fresh questions about its spending, amid warnings the licence fee could be scrapped altogether.

Mr Allen claimed for 24 cupcakes on October 22 last year and another 24 on November 8.

The BBC insistsed the cakes were a gift for a programme production team.

The release also showed that he claimed £157.55 for a dinner linked to the sitcom Outnumbered, several taxis to take him to comedy gigs and £10 for a DVD - Pat Shortt 'One hell of a do Live'.

The taxis included £7 to take him from the set of the Mrs Brown movie to a nearby tube station.

He also claimed £211.85 for a leaving party for an unnamed member of staff attended by 15 people.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: 'There's nothing funny about blowing taxpayers' cash on cupcakes, so perhaps the Head of Comedy might be in the wrong job. 

'Combined with exorbitant taxis and speaking course junkets, the general impression licence fee payers will get from these expense claims is of a culture of waste at the BBC.

'Unless there is more accountability for the way licence fee revenues are used, sympathy for this outdated tax will continue to wane.'

The BBC’s head of television Danny Cohen and director of strategy James Purnell both registered tickets to a 'one-day Executive Public Speaking Course' called 'Own The Room' as gifts.

Purnell, a Cabinet minister in the last Labour government, also claimed £324 for 'Attending the Labour Conference' and spent £275 registering for the Conservative Party conference.

There were further treats for staff from the controller of BBC Radio 3 Roger Wright who claimed £900 - equivalent to more than six licence fees - for a thank you lunch for the team of 36 people who had worked on the BBC Proms season.

Wright, who is director of the Proms and is paid a salary of £219,650, also claimed taxi fares which amounted to £924 on taxis in a 36-day period last summer. With his previously published quarterly expenses, it brings his total taxi claim for last year's Proms season to £1,386.

The newly released figures show the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob claimed £486.96 on taxis during the quarter.

The £168,300-a-year executive - who earns further income for his presenting duties - also claimed for a £1,502.53 return flight to New York in November and £644 for a four-night spell in the boutique hotel, Sixty LES. The BBC said he was there to meet producers and also for filming commitments.

The BBC's director of news James Harding - who is paid a salary of £340,000 - was reimbursed for flights to Delhi, Zurich and New York - which totalled £2,409.61.

The BBC's former HR director Lucy Adams claimed £321 for 'dinner as part of HR director awayday'.

Ms Adams, who left the corporation in March, was roundly criticised for overseeing the department while large payouts were controversially given to outgoing staff.

In another claim, the BBC's director of workplace and safety, Paul Greeves, claimed £475 for 'thank you drinks' for 19 members of a 'successful procurement team'.

Taxi claims for senior BBC executives for the three-month period have risen by 21.4 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, to stand at £26,023.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'We have strict rules on when taxis are allowed, for example when public transport does not serve the destination or late night travel is required, and we have cut our taxi spend by 33% since the same period in 2009/10.'
