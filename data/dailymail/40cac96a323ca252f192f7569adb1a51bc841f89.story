A Tory MP claimed expenses for condolence cards to send to the families of dead constituents.

Caroline Dinenage claimed £3.95 for a pack of three 'sympathy cards' new records published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal.

The Gosport MP filed the expense claim under 'hospitality' and insisted the claim was fair.

Tory MP Caroline Dinenage replaced Sir Peter Viggers - who was notorious for his duck island expenses claim - in the safe Conservative seat of Gosport

The 42-year-old backbencher insisted she did not need to pay for the cards because she sent them in 'her capacity as an MP', according to the Telegraph.

Miss Dineage's spokesman said she sent the cards for 'consolation or condolence' when a 'formal letter wouldn’t be appropriate'.

But the revelation sparked anger - with one MP suggesting that she did know the difference between work and ordinary manners.

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: 'This is the old problem of people not differentiating what they should be doing personally and what they should be doing professionally.'

Treasury Select Committee member John Mann has been a long-term critic of MPs abusing the expenses system. He attacked Miss Dinenage for forgetting the difference between what she should do professionally and what she should do anyway

He compared the scandal to the when MPs claimed expenses for Remembrance Sunday wreaths.

In 2009, the Telegraph, revealed that Boris Johnson, Ed Balls and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy all claimed for the cost of a Remembrance wreath

A spokesman for Miss Dinenage told the Telegraph today that Miss Dinenage did not pay for the cards herself because they were sent in 'her capacity as an MP'.

He added that they often contained other 'information or correspondence'.

'They are cards that are used for correspondence with constituents when a formal letter would not be appropriate – consolation or condolence,' he said.

'There needs to be something in Caroline’s capacity as an MP [for when] a formal letter wouldn’t be quite right.

'Over the past couple of years we have had constituents that have passed away – if someone has raised this with Caroline when Caroline is corresponding with them then when a formal letter wouldn’t be quite right it’s a card to send instead.

'It is sort of in her formal capacity as MP. It’s when something that needs to be done, it isn’t just a note of sympathy – it won’t just be a personal note. There will be something in her role as an MP, some information, some correspondence in there that isn’t the card.'

Miss Dinenage succeeded Sir Peter Viggers as Gosport MP. He sparked controversy when he claimed £1,600 for a floating duck island. At the time she described surrounding expenses scandal as a 'nightmare'.
