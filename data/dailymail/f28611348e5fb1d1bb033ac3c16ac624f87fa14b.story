The family of a snowboarder who went missing in the Alps have spoken of their heartache after his body was finally found three weeks later.

Steven Rollett, 35, had been snowboarding with friends when he became stuck in a 'basin' of deep snow.

Before his friends had a chance to return with help, he had disappeared without a trace.

The much-loved father, whose wife Nicola is 30 weeks pregnant, was found dead three weeks after going missing in Meribel, in France.

Now Stephen's wife has spoken of the 'most wonderful and amazing person' who will 'live forever' through their unborn daughter.

Nicola said: 'He was my whole world and my life will never be the same without him. 

'He was the most wonderful and amazing person I have ever known and he will live on forever in his daughter I carry.

'He's left a hole in my heart that will never be filled. RIP my beautiful husband, I will love you always.'

Steven, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, arrived at the ski resort on Saturday, January 31, with friends.

They enjoyed an afternoon of snowboarding before three of them including Steven began using a popular off-piste slope.

His heartbroken parents David, 59, and Barbara Rollett, 57, told how Steven veered into an area which was like a basin of snow and became stuck.

The family had to endure an horrendous wait before Steven's body was discovered on February 23.

Barbara Rollett said: 'We're devastated. Nicola has lost her soul-mate. She is absolutely gutted. She's trying to be strong because she's got to look after their baby.

'While they were still looking for Steve she was harbouring hopes of him still being found alive. Now we will have to do what we can for Steve and Nicola and our grandchildren. 

'Our focus is on looking after Nicola, with her parents who have been very good.

'Steve and Nicola's new baby girl will be the light at the end of the tunnel. Steve was so excited about haying a baby daughter and in a way he can live on through her and we take comfort from that.'

Steven, who also has a 14-year-old son from a previous relationship, disappeared after friends tried to get help.

Mr Rollett said: 'There were others using the slope and there was nothing to indicate it was dangerous. 

'Steve veered off to an area which was like a basin and it was full of a lot of snow and he became stuck and couldn't get out.

'His friends could see him and were talking to him but he was on an uphill slope and he was struggling to get out. 

'They went to get help and by this time the resort was coming to a standstill but they kept the ski slopes open to allow the boys to go back to pinpoint where he was to rescuers but by this time he had disappeared.'

Despite a three-hour search, the resort's security team, a mountain rescue team and a helicopter could not find Steven as snow came in over Saturday, January 31, and Sunday, February 1.

One of Steven's friends alerted his family while his parents were in Spain and David and his brother Ray got flights to France by Monday, February 2.

Mr Rollett added: 'We were beside ourselves. By 5pm the same day, mountain rescue people came and told us there was no sign Steve would be found alive after he had been missing two days and it was a case of waiting to see if his body turned up.'

Mr Rollett added: 'We received the peace of knowing he had been found and I believe he died from hypothermia. 

'The chalet managers had been very supportive and the rescuers had done all they could and didn't leave a stone unturned. So we're very grateful for everything they did.'

A funeral is expected this month on a date to be fixed. Those awaiting details can contact Wetton Funeral Service on 01246 232966.

Steven also leaves a son Bradley Annetts, sister Louise Biggs, brother-in-law Gavin Biggs, two nieces and a nephew.
