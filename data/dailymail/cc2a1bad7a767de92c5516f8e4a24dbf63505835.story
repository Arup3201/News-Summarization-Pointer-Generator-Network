Chelsi 
Camp's maternal instincts were so strong that she physically bit off the
 ear of a raging pitbull which nearly mauled her two-year-old daughter 
to death last month inside their Alvin, Texas, home.

Now,
 she has spoken out for the first time to reveal how she had to shove 
her fist into the dogs mouth while wrestling the dog off her little 
girl, Mackenzi.

'You do whatever you can,' said Camp. 'I don't have physical strength at my side.'

On the mend: Mackenzie Camp who has spoken for the first time and her mother, Chelsi, right, are visited in hospital by 911 dispatcher Rhonda Barrow, left, and Officers Massey and Zavesky, who saved the little girl

Two-year-old
 Mackenzie Camp was left with severe head and facial injuries after a 
normally friendly dog turned on the toddler on March 31.

'The
 dog came up and he was just curious,' recalled Camp. 'When he smelled 
her, that's when you saw it flip because I think he smelled my dog on 
her,' said Camp to KHOU.com.

Left with no option but to fight to save her daughter, Camp jumped in between the dog and her child.

'I
 only know to fight so how else do you get somebody to stop,' Camp 
explained. 'I mean I would do the same thing with a human being.'

Camp suffered wounds to her arms and hands and is recovering along with her daughter now at home.

'I can actually hold her again,' said Camp. 'I couldn't hold her for the first week that was the hardest part.'

When police arrived they found the mother and daughter cowering in the bathroom, where the dog had corned them.

The animal, which belonged to 23-year-old Miss Camp's boyfriend, was shot by police and later euthanized.

Mackenzie's
 injuries were so extensive that she had to be airlifted to hospital and
 was in surgery for seven hours immediately after the attack.

Despite her ordeal, her family say the little girl is sitting up in her hospital bed and smiling.

A
 Facebook update from Mackenzie's aunt, Sheryl Camp, said on April 6: 
'I'm pleased to say she doesn't remember a thing. It's amazing what they
 were able to do to put her back together.

'As she grows these scars will fade. If they don't, she is still beautiful like her mother.'

Several
 fundraising events were held in the community and a Go Fund Me page 
raised more than $13,000 towards Mackenzie's medical costs.

The
 pit bull attack was so vicious that the first emergency workers on the 
scene said it will haunt them for the rest of their lives.

As
 soon as Mackenzie was out of intensive care, Officers Massey and 
Zavesky and 911 dispatcher, Rhonda Darrow, who handled the call, visited
 the little girl and her mom at Memorial Hermann Hospital.

The group were pictured with Miss Camp, who had two bandaged hands, and Mackenzie, who looked frail in her hospital bed.

Shocking: Chelsi Camp and her two-year-old daughter Mackenzie are recovering after the attack on March 31

A 
post on the League City Police Department's Facebook page said: 'Rarely 
do we get to know what happens after the emergency response is over. And
 there are some calls that haunt us for the rest of our careers.'

Miss Camp frantically called 911, and spoke to Ms Darrow, after the dog unexpectedly turned on her daughter at about 8.45am.

Police
 said the dog was still attacking the girl when they arrived and an 
officer shot the animal so other officers could help the mother and 
daughter.

'It
 was a very bad scene,' Reagan Pena with the League City Police 
Department told KHOU, adding of Miss Camp: 'Obviously she was trying to 
prevent the dog from attacking her child.'

The
 animal was shot once at the scene but did not die, authorities said. 
Animal control later euthanized the dog and it was carried away from the
 scene in a body bag.
