Early sketches of some of the breakthrough moments in popular culture - from Superman in flight to the creation of Hello Kitty - have been revealed.

The collection of drawings, which also include the original Dennis the Menace comic strip drawn on the back of a cigarette packet, have gone on display at the O2's Eureka! Gallery in  east London.

It also features some more modern illustrations including the plans for the Covent Garden Christmas decorations, drawn up in 2010, and this year's Serpentine Pavilion.

The original sketch by special effects supervisor Andrew Ainsworth shows how he planned to make Superman 'fly' whilst being attached to a wire in the 1978 movie

Christopher Reeve played Superman in the 1978 movie, which left filmmakers struggling to decide how best to make the actor look like he was really flying

The theme for the collection is the moment of 'eureka' experienced by some of the world’s greatest creative visionaries including designers, architects and animators.

Andrew Ainsworth drew up with the first ever sketch showing Superman flying on 'wires' for the groundbreaking 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve.

He unearthed the 1977 sketch while sifting through his attic earlier this year and found it buried in the bottom of a suitcase. 

Producers for the movie version of the comic had been struggling to come up with how the Man of Steel would fly on-screen logistically.

Early sketches of Hello Kitty, who was created by Yuko Yamaguchi, which was first displayed in 1974

The character's first appearance was on a vinyl coin purse in Japan and brought to the United States in 1976

They tried firing a crash test dummy from a cannon, using a remote control to fly the dummy around and 'high quality animation' before realising that none of them produced the required 'flying' effect.

Producer Ilya Salkind said at the time the film 'lost about $2 million on flying tests' before getting it right. 

Mr Ainsworth said his 'eureka' moment came a year after the script was submitted when he showed how he envisaged Superman being suspended form a rail with a pulley-system.

He drew the superhero with a fan blowing in his face to 'give the illusion of movement to his hair and cape'.

Mr Ainsworth, who was the special effects supervisor on the Superman movie, said: 'Back then I only had pencil and paper to work out how the vision in my head could be made a reality on the screen.

The first drawing of Dennis the Menace on the back of a cigarette packet by Ian 'Chiz' Chisholm - a leading member of The Beano editorial team - in 1950 at a meeting with bosses in a pub in Dundee

Dennis the Menace, who first appeared in the comic in 1951, became the Beano's longest running and most popular comic strip

Two months after his first appearance in The Beano he was given his familiar black and red jersey

'Today, we have the wonders of technology to be able to play with and see whole scenes come to life before a frame has been shot.'

The artist, who also created the Stormtrooper helmet for the Star Wars movies, added: 'I put this picture away in a drawer at the time and then it must have been filed away with some papers before it finally made its way to the loft.

'When I was approached to take part in this exhibition, I felt that it was time to look it out.

'A couple of days later, just when I was convinced it was lost forever, it turned up in a suitcase in a cupboard in my loft.'

In the end, producers used rolling riggings suspended from cranes and studio ceilings, with Christopher Reeve or his stunt double attached by wires.

The movie cost £35 million ($55m) to make in the end and reaped huge success at the box office, pulling in a massive £190 million ($300m).

Mark Champkins, inventor in residence at London's Science Museum and who has worked with O2 on the exhibition, said: 'We were blown away when Andrew said he'd rediscovered this image and we knew we had to include it.

'Superman: The Movie was an iconic piece of film-making and so much of today's superhero cinema - the likes of X-Men, Thor, the Avengers - can still trace a direct line of descent back to it.

'This sketch - which shows the Eureka! moment when the film-makers worked out how to make superhuman powers appear real on film - is an important and breakthrough moment in cinema in a pre-digital age.

'Displaying this image on the latest and greatest digital technology is a sign of how far we've come when it comes to the tools of invention.'

The clothing, which is designed for the most extreme environments, hit Korean stores in December 2013

Among the other exhibits at the show of 'cultural breakthroughs' on show at the gallery include the original sketch of Dennis the Menace, drawn on the back of a a cigarette packet.

The sketch, on the back of a packet of Player's Navy Cut cigarettes, was knocked up in 1950 by Ian 'Chiz' Chisholm, a leading member of The Beano editorial team at a meeting with bosses at a pub in Dundee.

Dennis the Menace, who first appeared in the comic in 1951, became the Beano's longest running and most popular comic strip.

Other sketches on show include Hello Kitty, created by Yuko Yamaguchi in 1974, the lead designer at Japanese company Sanrio.

These early sketches show drawings by Leonardo da Vinci of parachute experiments in the 15th century

Ms. Yamaguchi has spent the past 30 years leading the evolution of the beloved global icon and Hello Kitty is now available on over 50,000 products available in over 130 countries worldwide. 

She also came up with the designs for Hello Kitty's 'boyfriend' Dear Daniel in 1999 and her pet cat Charmmy Kitty in 2004.  

Da Vinci's parachute from 1501 and Elizabeth Emanuel's sketch of Princess Diana's Wedding Dress from 1981 are also included in the rare collection, which is being shown on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
