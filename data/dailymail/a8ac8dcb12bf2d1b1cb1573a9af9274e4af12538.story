A majority of Republican supporters don't believe in evolution and instead are convinced that humans have existed in their present form since the dawn of time.

The analysis published this week by the Pew Research Center found that by comparison, a majority of Democrats do believe that man is descended from apes.

The poll found that 67 percent of Democrats believe believe 'humans and other things have evolved over time’, compared to 43 percent of Republicans.

Creationism versus Evolution: Research has found a widening gap between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to how man came to be

The number of Republicans who believe in human evolution has declined nine percent since 2009

One of the most interesting trends to emerge from the analysis is that the number of Republicans who don’t believe in evolution has shifted in the past four years.

In 2009, the amount of Republicans who though humans evolved over time was 54 percent but when the same question was asked earlier this year that number had dropped nine points to 43 percent.

During the same time period, the number of Democrats who think humans evolved increased three points to 67 percent.

‘Republicans are less inclined than either Democrats or political independents to say that humans have evolved over time,’ the study reads.

Several senior Republican figures including Mike Huckabee, left, and Paul Broun, right, have questioned or attacked evolution in recent years

In 2012 Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia blasted evolution, embryology and the big bang as 'lies straight from the pit of hell'

The enduring popularity of the creationism theory within the U.S. puts it at odds with most other developed nations.

An overwhelming majority of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity.

Nearly every scientific society, representing hundreds of thousands of scientists, has issued statements rejecting intelligent design and a petition supporting the teaching of evolutionary biology was endorsed by 72 US Nobel Prize winners.

Additionally, U.S. courts have ruled in favor of teaching evolution in science classrooms, and against teaching creationism however in recent years several senior Republican figures have questioned or attacked evolution in the public sphere.

In 2012 Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia blasted evolution, embryology and the big bang as ‘lies straight from the pit of hell.’

‘I hold the Holy Bible as being the major
 directions to me of how I vote in Washington, D.C. and I'll continue to
 do that,’ the young earth creationist said to resounding applause.

One third of Americans still believe in Creationism versus Evolution

During the 2008 U.S. Republican presidential primaries former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee spoke publicly about his skepticism of evolution.

‘A person either believes that God created this process or that it was an accident,’ Huckabee said during a debate, ‘and that it just happened all on its own.’

Huckabee also dismissed the thought that his rejection of evolution plays any his role in whether he is qualified for public office.

The PEW study was conducted between March 21 and April 8, 2013, with a representative sample of 1,983 adults, aged 18 and older.

The survey was conducted on landlines and cellphones in all 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. The margin of error was three percentage points. 

Overall the poll found that 60 percent of Americans believed in evolution, compared to 33 percent who believed human had evolved over time.

When those people polled were divided by their religious affiliation the results showed that majority of white evangelicals believe that a supreme being guided evolution

Of the group of people who believe in evolution, 32 percent believe it was due to natural selection, while
 roughly 24 percent believe that 'a supreme being guided the evolution 
of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in 
the form it exists today.'

While 78 percent of white mainline protestants said they believed humans and other animals had evolved over time, the number was just 27 percent for white evangelicals.

According to PEW, the belief in creationism versus evolution is closely linked to religious background and race.

The study also investigated the differences between demographic groups and also  the differences in language.

They worded the evolution question in two different ways. One way they phrased it as 'humans and other living things' and the other way they phrased it was as 'animals and other living things.'

They found that exchanging animals for humans made very little difference in people's beliefs about evolution.

However, the study found that men were more likely than women to believe that humans/ animals and other living things evolved.

They also found those who had completed a form of higher education believed in evolution more than people who hadn't.
