More than five months after an Aboriginal woman was shot by a police officer armed with a Taser gun, blinding her left eye, Queensland police are yet to reveal the findings of an investigation into the officer who fired it.

Sheila Oakley was hit inside her home, in Logan, south of Brisbane, during an altercation with police back in February.

Soon after, the state's Ethical Standards Command launched an investigation set-up to explore the conduct of the officer who fired the weapon, and whether the police officer's claim of self defence was justified.

Sheila Oakley was struck with a taser fired by a police officer, leaving her blind in one eye.

The officer, who was a skilled taser user and trainer, alleged Ms Oakley was threatening police with a table leg which had nails protruding from it. But the case, now more than five months in, is still being investigated and civil libertarian and criminal lawyer Terry O'Gorman wants to know why.

Mr O'Gorman has questioned a lack of urgency by police and has demanded that the Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart give reasons why the investigation has taken so long.

'It's an unacceptably long time': Lawyer Terry O'Gorman claims the investigation by Queensland police is lagging.

'Why has it taken since February? It's now July,' he told ABC.

'Why has it taken so long for such a straightforward issue to be investigated.'

He said 'It's an unacceptably long time' and has accused police of delaying the investigation on the grounds that the case is not 'high profile.'

'The fact is that when police want to, (they) pump resources into high profile issues that they choose.

'In relation to complaints against police, they are given a low priority. They are deliberately delayed in the hope that journalists will forget it, and in the hope that complainants will just get sick of the delay and give up.'

The investigation was launched immediately after the February incident.

Mr O'Gorman who has met with Ms Oakley said she is still waiting to hear of the outcome of that investigation.

Police have said there is still one further witness to be interviewed and a final report is expected to be completed by July 30.
