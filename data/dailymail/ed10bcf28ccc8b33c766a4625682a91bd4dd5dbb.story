Since undergoing lap-band surgery in February, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been 'losing weight steadily.'

The plain-speaking governor, who's known for his generous physique, has been given the all-clear by his doctor, who said in medical report that Christie is 'fit to serve.'

Christie, 51, has apparently adopted a more healthy lifestyle since the surgery and continues to lose weight, according to his doctor.

The two-page report from Christie's cardiologist, Dr Rachana Kulkarni, notes that the governor has been 'very compliant' with follow-up treatments and has been eating healthily and exercising four times a week.

While the report failed to mention Christie's starting weight and current weight, the Republican has appeared noticably slimmer in recent days.

He told CBS Sunday Morning that he is more than halfway to his goal weight.

Christie's Democrat opponent Barbara Buono challenged him to release his medical records in a debate three weeks ago.

'Governor Christie has normal blood work, normal cardiovascular test results, and good functional capacity,' the report stated.

'He has no medical limitations and is fit to serve as the Governor of the state of New Jersey.'

It's been speculated that Christie's health-kick is a preemptive measure to deter any concerns about his fitness to run for office.

He's a possible candidate for president in 2016, having refused to rule out his candidacy during the debate with Buono.

Christie is seeking a second term as New Jersey governor in the election to be held November 5.
