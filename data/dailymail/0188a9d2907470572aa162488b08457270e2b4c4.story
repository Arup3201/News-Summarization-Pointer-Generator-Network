A cruel dog owner in Croatia paid a canine 'hitman' to kill his unwanted pet, because he was too tight-fisted to have the animal disposed of humanely.

The owner, who has not been identified, paid just £4 to have the dog shot and thrown into a river, rather than paying £30 to have a vet euthanise the healthy animal.

But the dog - formerly called Olly but now nicknamed Lucky - somehow survived both the shotgun blast and the plunge into icy water.

Olly the dog was left for dead when his cruel owner paid a 'hitman' just £4 to have him executed and dumped in a river. However the pet survived and is now recovering at an animal shelter (right)

Olly's owner, who has not been identified, aid the hitman because he was too tight-fisted to fork out £30 to have a vet destroy the healthy animal humanely

After being blasted with buckshot Olly, who had been nicknamed Lucky, was left in an icy river to drown

The dog's limp body was spotted floating down the river by fishermen who took him to a local shelter

He was shot on the banks of the Drava River near the northern Croatian village of Orehovec, and then hurled into the water by his would-be killer.

Fortunately for Lucky, he was spotted as he floated downstream by some fishermen.

'My son saw him,' said Pawel Brodzky. 'He was floating like a log past us and suddenly his front leg moved, as if he was waving at us.

Olly's attacker was caught after fishermen who spotted his body saw a man loading a shotgun into a car

The would-be killer is now facing court as animal workers believe he is behind a string of canine executions

Olly will now spend the rest of his days at the centre unless another owner comes forward to adopt him

'We pulled the poor creature from the water and took him to a local animal shelter, where he was said to be in poor shape but strong enough to survive.'

Brodzky got the number plate of a hunter further down the river after he saw the assassin putting a gun in the boot of his car.

Animal welfare workers believe the same hunter also shot several other dogs in the past. He now faces up to a year in jail on animal cruelty charges.

Horrifying images of Olly's injuries show he was riddled with buckshot when he arrived at the animal shelter

Surgeons spent hours removing shot from Olly's head and legs. He is expected to recover in two months

Olly's attacker could be facing a year behind bars if he is found guilty of animal cruelty charges

Lucky will now live out his days in an animal shelter unless he is adopted.

He needed surgery for head and leg wounds from the buckshot but should be up and about within two months.
