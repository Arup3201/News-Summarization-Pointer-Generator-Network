The eclectic Joey Barton added another string to his bow with the Morrissey-loving Twitter sage watching the Oakland Raiders train ahead of Sunday’s game with the Miami Dolphins.

The fiesty QPR midfielder is currently nursing a hamstring injury but headed to plush Pennyhill Park to observe the Raiders first-hand.

‘I’m just seeing how they approach stuff. How they approach training, especially with so many big guys. How they fit them all onto one field. They are totally organised and it’s a huge training session. It’s very interesting.’

‘They’ve got a really good structure. They plan to the Nth degree. Everything they do is in centimetres. Watching the quarterbacks earlier on, they are just running repetitive drills over and over and over again to get it right for the game on Sunday.

‘I believe in cross-pollination. I think we can learn a lot from lots of other different sports, this being one of them.’

Barton, who will attend at Sunday’s game, added: ‘It would be great to be able to watch a different team. I’m thinking about the dynasties like Belichick’s Patriots in action. Would they train differently. Or if they do train, how would they differ between each other?’

And fresh from berating Mario Balotelli, the 32-year-old also admitted he will not feature in the Hoops’ trip to Southampton on Saturday.

‘I’m going to miss the game this weekend because it’s really tight. I was in this morning just seeing how it was, so I’ll probably be up against it for this weekend. But I’ll run probably in the next couple of days and see how I am. And hopefully I’ve got a chance.’
