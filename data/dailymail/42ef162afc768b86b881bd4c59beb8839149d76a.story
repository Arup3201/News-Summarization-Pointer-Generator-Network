Suspected fraud: Author Hanif Kureishi has lost £120,000 in a property investment recommended by his then accountant

Bestselling author Hanif Kureishi has lost his £120,000 life savings after falling victim to an alleged investment fraud.

Kureishi, best known for his novel The Buddha Of Suburbia and the screenplay for the hit film My Beautiful Laundrette, last night spoke of his ‘hellish’ experience and claimed that other well-known authors may also have been caught up in the same alleged scam.

‘There have been sleepless nights and a genuine feeling of helplessness,’ said the father of three.

‘This money was meant to be for my children’s education and for my future while I worked on another book.’

He added: ‘I think that there are probably five or six more big-name writers caught up in this.’

Kureishi’s ordeal, which is the subject of a police investigation, began when he asked his representatives at The Agency, one of Britain’s most respected film agencies, to recommend a firm of accountants.

The Agency, which also represents novelists William Boyd and Ian McEwan, suggested a firm called Fisher Phillips, which does its own accounts and also looks after some of its star names.

Kureishi’s affairs were handed over to Adam Woricker, then a partner at the firm, who met the award-winning writer at his London home.

It was at this meeting that Kureishi was first given details of an ill-fated property deal which he subsequently agreed to join.

The author was told that if he invested £50,000 he would get a 15 per cent return within 120 days.Shortly after the first payment of £7,500 arrived, Kureishi agreed to invest a further £70,000.

The first the author knew something was amiss was when Fisher Phillips contacted him to say Woricker had been fired.

He said: ‘Woricker appeared to be a very charming man and a very sweet guy. He said to me that numerous other clients of Fisher Phillips and many of my fellow writers, as he put it, were investing in this particular scheme.’

Kureishi, 58, is now bringing a claim against Fisher Phillips to try to get his money back. He said all his communications with Woricker were through the firm’s email system and he believed Woricker was acting on its behalf.

Kureishi claims Fisher Phillips has subsequently behaved in a ‘disgraceful and shocking way’ and  even threatened him with legal action to try to stop him talking about his ordeal.

Fisher Phillips denies it is liable because it had no prior knowledge of the scheme and it sacked Woricker as soon as it was discovered what he was allegedly doing.

A spokesman said: ‘Adam Woricker was dismissed as a partner of Fisher Phillips in July 2012.

'We were made aware that he had been personally involved in raising finance for an investment scheme and we would like to stress that he was not acting on behalf of Fisher Phillips but in a personal capacity.’

Mr Woricker was arrested in March and bailed until May 28. He was unavailable for comment last night.

The Mail on Sunday was also unable to reach anyone at The Agency for comment.
