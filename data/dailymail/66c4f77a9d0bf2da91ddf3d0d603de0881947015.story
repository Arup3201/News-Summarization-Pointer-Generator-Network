Wayne Rooney has revealed he will have a special companion by his side when he takes to the field at Old Trafford on Sunday - his eldest son Kai.

Last November Kai and his younger brother Klay were mascots when their father won his 100th England cap against Slovenia at Wembley.

And the striker revealed in a post on Instagram on Saturday evening that five-year-old Kai will accompany him on to the pitch for the Spurs game in Manchester this weekend.

Wayne Rooney will walk out with his son Kai by his side on Sunday, as he did before England vs Slovenia

Rooney will hope he gets a similar result, after scoring twice last time his son was mascot

'Big game tomorrow against Tottenham at Old Trafford. Looking forward to walking out again with my son Kai as mascot!' the 29-year-old United captain wrote next to a picture of him and his two sons on the pitch before the Slovenia match.

Rooney scored the opening goal in a 3-1 win that night and United will be hoping for a similar result when they face their rivals for Champions League qualification on Sunday.

For Rooney's 100th cap he brought both kids onto the pitch, but on Sunday just Kai will be mascot

Rooney is in good form at the moment, with three goals in his last three games, since being moved up front
