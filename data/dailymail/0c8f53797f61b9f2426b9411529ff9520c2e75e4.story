'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B': What parents may be called in legal terms if same sex marriage is introduced

Parents could be legally referred to as 'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B' under plans for same sex marriage, regardless of their sexuality, it has been claimed.

A leading lawyer said, if the institution of marriage is redefined, the erosion of traditional words such as 'mother' and 'father' from British law could have 'Orwellian' consequences.

Lord Brennan QC, an opponent of same sex marriage, also claimed the removal of such words from the statute books could result in legislative chaos.

The Labour peer said extending the institution of marriage to include homosexual couples could require amendments to laws dating back 800 years, it has been reported.

He said analysis of other countries which had already legalised same sex marriage had shown erosion of traditional words in statute, such as 'mother', 'father', 'wife' and 'husband'.

Writing in the Telegraph, Lord Brennan - who is also the president of the Catholic Union of Great Britain - used Spain as a recent example, where the Socialist government introduced gay marriage in 2005.

He wrote: 'The following year it was announced that Spanish birth certificates would read "Progenitor A" and "Progenitor B" instead of "mother" and "father".

'This kind of language is Orwellian. Can we really expect the same kind of thing here if marriage is redefined?'

Lord Brennan's warning was dismissed as scaremongering by supporters of same sex marriage, who said the adjustment of legislative language was common practice when new laws are introduced.

A draft Bill drawn up by the gay rights group Stonewall proposed amending the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 using the term 'parties to the marriage' to replace the words 'husband' and 'wife'.

In current law, the word 'husband' appears 1,003 times, 'wife' 888 times and 'spouse' 2,740.

However the QC - who is a member of 
Matrix Chambers and has also represented the families of the Omagh bomb 
victims - argued it would take up too much of the government's time and 
energy making the amendments.

He added in his commentary in the Telegraph: 'In the present grave economic situation, which does Mr Cameron think that so much government and parliamentary time and energy should be dedicated to such a change in the law, effectively obliterating vast amounts of our cultural and legal heritage?'

Ben Summerskill, from the gay rights group Stonewall, said there was no evidence extending marriage to same sex couple would cause legal chaos adding: 'I doubt there is legislation from the reign of Edward I that refers to trains or traffic lights but somehow we've managed to amend it.'

If the law is changed, Britain will 
become the sixth European country - after the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Sweden, Spain and Norway - to recognise same-sex marriage.

An end to discrimination? But gay marriage ceremonies might not be allowed to take place in church

Despite fierce opposition from the 
church, David Cameron has remained resolute in his determination to end 
the discrimination faced by homosexual couples.

However, Downing Street - in what is thought to be a bid to avert a damaging rebellion by the bishops who sit in the House of Lords - has insisted that the gay marriage ceremonies will not be allowed to take place in church.

Mr Cameron faces a major revolt by up to 100 Conservative MPs who have threatened to vote against or abstain when the measure, which is backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, comes to the Commons.

The coalition led by Lord Carey, which is backed by Tory MPs, peers and family groups, will warn the Government to leave traditional marriage alone.

It also says the changes are not wanted by the majority of the population and will require the rewriting of 800 years of legislation.

The word ‘marriage’ appears 3,258 times in UK legislation, which underlines the central role the institution plays in national law.

If the change goes ahead the Government could face legal challenges from the heterosexual community. Ministers have ruled out extending civil partnerships, which became law in December 2005, beyond the gay community.

Even though none of the three main political parties included the proposal in their manifestos at the 2010 election, the legislation could be in the next Queen’s Speech in May.

A new grassroots organisation, the 
Coalition For Marriage (C4M), opposes the redefinition of marriage
to include same sex couples.

It was launched in response to the forthcoming publication of a consultation document by the Equalities 
Minister, Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone, on how to introduce same-sex 
marriage before 2015.

Colin Hart, C4M's campaign director, said the proposed upheaval was being driven by the forces of political correctness and a handful of single-issue pressure groups.

He said: ‘The word marriage is woven into the fabric of our national laws. That can’t be just unpicked in a single stroke.'
