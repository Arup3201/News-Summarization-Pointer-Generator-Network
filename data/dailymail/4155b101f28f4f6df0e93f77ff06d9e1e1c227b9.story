Detroit’s newly-appointed emergency financial manager won’t rule out bankruptcy for the city and says the step might be one he’ll be forced to take.

Kevyn Orr assumes the newly created job post March 25, but he told the Detroit Free Press Friday that he’s comfortable orchestrating what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.

The ailing Midwestern city holds around $14 billion in debts and Orr was chosen for the job by Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder.

Big problems: Lawyer Kevyn Orr was chosen by Mich. Governor Rick Snyder to be Detroit's first Emergency Financial Manager and tackle the ailing city's massive debt problems

Ahead of his first day, Orr—a veteran in corporate bankruptcy—dropped hints that it might be in the interest of the strapped city’s creditors to help cut a deal.

‘The one thing everyone needs to know: If you go into bankruptcy,’ said the hard-hitting Washington, DC attorney, ‘Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code is weighted toward the municipality.’

Orr was careful to stress his desire to find other solutions to the city’s extreme money woes.

‘I prefer to pursue a consensual resolution,’ Orr said.

Regardless of Orr’s preference, however, he acknowledges the threat of bankruptcy court is powerful leverage in his negotiations with creditors.

Dire straights: Detroit's decline has been fast and steep and the city now owes its creditors around $14 billion after years of over-borrowing

‘I think it can be done because the issue of the crisis is...so significant,’ he said. ‘I would think it would be reasonable within their authority to make a negotiated solution.’

If the city and Orr do proceed with the bankruptcy, reports the Free Press, it would likely take the form of a prepackaged bankruptcy.

In such a deal, Orr would work out the terms of the deal with all Detroit’s creditors and present them alongside his bankruptcy petition.

Those parties include vendors of goods and services, municipal bondholders, unions, pensioners, and others.

Members of such groups, many of whom are left to assume that benefits like union-level wages are on the chopping block by Orr, are now protesting the emergency financial manager's appointment.

Not all good: Though Orr might help the city as a whole, groups like city workers fear cuts he'll make will take away benefits they now enjoy

Orr will be doing a great deal of negotiating whether or not bankruptcy enters the picture, it seems.

Though he might be Detroit’s best hope out of a tough situation, he doesn’t see himself as a savior for the city, but rather as a man working to show Detroit how to save itself.

‘I view my role as providing some architecture for a sustainable model for the city going forward.’

How he’ll build such an architecture, in a city that struggles to provide its residents with basic municipal services, remains to be seen.

But, Orr says 'everything's on the table.'
