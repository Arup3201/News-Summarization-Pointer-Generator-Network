A broken theme park ride left thrill seekers, many of them children, stranded in mid-air for up to two hours.

Fire crews had to cut 39 people from safety restraints last night as they hung 20ft in the air on the Rameses Revenge ride.

Riders, including 25 children, are believed to have become trapped on the attraction at Chessington World of Adventures, Surrey.

Stuck: The fault was caused by a mechanical failure which saw the riders trapped in their harnesses

The fault was caused by a mechanical 
failure which saw the riders trapped in their harnesses. The London 
Fire Brigade managed to get everyone off by 7:30pm with specialist 
cutting equipment.

Nobody was injured but several were said to be ‘agitated and stressed’.

It is thought staff tried to restart 
the ride before calling 999 at 5.20pm. It then took two hours to free 
riders as staff handed up sunscreen and water.

Justin Coo, of London Fire Brigade, 
said children as young as eight were likely to have been trapped, but 
due to a minimum height requirement of 4ft 7in there were not thought 
to be any younger children.

Mr Coo said at 7pm that there were around 15 people left on the ride - and half an hour later the fire service had confirmed that everyone had been rescued.

He added that Chessington had been looking after the riders - ‘feeding and watering them’ - while park staff tried to release all 39 themselves, before they decided to call the fire brigade.

He told Sky News: ‘As to how it 
happened, it's a mechanical failure. We've only got about 15 people 
remaining on the ride. They had been there for about two hours before.

‘We've
 had one minor asthma attack. We had 39 in total on the ride, and I 
would suggest that two thirds of those were children - probably from 
about age eight upwards.’

‘We can confirm that there has been 
the failure and we're using our dedicated cutters. They (Chessington) 
were looking to have a mechanical solution themselves - and they asked 
us to attend.’

'There are some kids on there with learning difficulties that are being brought down. It is very concerning because they were stuck and all the electrics failed'

Mother whose daughter, 13, was on ride

One mother whose 13-year-old daughter was on board said the ride stopped at around 4pm.

She told Sky News: ‘They have been 
sending up water and sun cream to them because it was rather hot 
initially. They are taking children down first.

‘There are some kids on there with 
learning difficulties that are being brought down. It is very concerning
 because they were stuck and all the electrics failed.

‘They were on the ride for 90 minutes 
before the fire and rescue service came out to them. I think they are 
all in a little personal discomfort. I hear some people are in a bit of 
distress now.’

A fire engine from Surbiton fire station
 along with three fire rescue units from Wimbledon, Battersea and Heston
 stations were at the scene.

Break down: Officials at the park - which was founded as a zoo in 1931 on the grounds of a country mansion, before reopening as a theme park in 1987 - confirmed the attraction would be open tomorrow

The
 ride sits in the 
Forbidden Kingdom area of the park - where adult tickets cost £43 on the
 gate - and was opened in 1995.

Its description on the park website says: 'Enjoy an exhilarating ride as Rameses Revenge turns you upside down, spins you around and lowers you head first over water fountains.'

'We are very sorry for any discomfort our guests experienced during the delay'

Chessington World of Adventures spokesman

A Chessington  spokesman said: ‘At 4:06pm the Rameses
Revenge at Chessington World of Adventures resort in Surrey experienced a
technical problem.

'This resulted in the automatic fail-safe system bringing the
ride to a controlled stop. Experienced resort staff were on site immediately to
assist with guest care. No guests were injured in the incident.

'A small number of
people were on the ride at the time and the resort's engineers worked with the
emergency services implementing well-rehearsed procedures to ensure their
comfort and safe removal from the ride. We are very sorry for any discomfort our guests experienced
during the delay.’
