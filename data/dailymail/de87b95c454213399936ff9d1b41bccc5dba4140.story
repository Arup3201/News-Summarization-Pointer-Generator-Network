A disturbing video has been released showing the horrifying moment a Melbourne man in his 40's was knocked over by his own delivery van and pinned beneath its wheels.

The footage, captured by CCTV from a nearby property in Balwyn, shows the man as he is pushed to the ground, before the van gathers speed and rolls over the top of him, dragging him into the street.

The man had been delivering a fridge to the house, and it was in the back of the vehicle when it began to roll towards him.

The van comes to a stop just before the front wheels roll over him, and he is shown trapped underneath the weight of the vehicle in the middle of the road. 

Despite the wheels rolling over man's upper body and head, he remained conscious and able to talk until ambulance officers arrived to rush him to hospital.

'The van began to roll, and he's attempted from the rear end to try and stop that himself, which didn't end too well,' Lindsay Bent from Ambulance Victoria told Channel Seven.

The man's colleague jumped into the van in order to turn off the vehicle's engine and prevent it from moving further, before the footage shows a maxi taxi arriving just outside the property. 

Andrew McArthur, a local resident who had arrived back with his family from a holiday in Hong Kong, immediately try to assist by lifting the van off the man's body, reported The Herald Sun.

'We stopped the car, got the jack out and jacked it up, took the pressure off and waited for the ambulance to arrive,' Mr McArthur said.

'We also chocked the van up with timber, just in case the jack slipped,' he said.

Police confirmed that the man's head was pinned under the car, but believed that because of the angle of the road, the man's head was not under the expected amount of pressure.

The man was trapped for 25 minutes, surrounded by those who had rushed to help him.

'He was complaining it was getting increasingly more uncomfortable for him,' Mr McArthur told Channel Seven.

'He was saying his back was really sore and the pressure was getting to him.'

The man suffered injuries to his pelvis and chest, and despite being taken to Alfred Hospital in a serious condition he is now stable and is expected to make a full recovery. 

The fridge in the back of the van stayed upright throughout the incident, shocking ambulance officers who said that his injuries could have been 'catastrophic'. 

'Put the park break on whatever you do, and stay safe,' said Sergeant Charl Van Tonder.
