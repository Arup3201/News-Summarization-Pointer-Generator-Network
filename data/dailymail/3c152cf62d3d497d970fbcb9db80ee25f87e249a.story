The dramatic moment an exhausted pet dog was plucked from a frozen lake after falling through the ice has been caught on camera.

Firefighter Sean Coyle risked his own safety to venture out on to frozen Pleasure Bay off Castle Island in South Boston during the rescue.

Sylvie, a 13-year-old husky, had plunged into the frigid water during her morning walk on Thursday.

She had spent more than 30 minutes treading water before help arrived.

Her frantic owner looked on, powerless to help, as the member of Ladder 19 put on a survival suit and headed onto the treacherous bay.

Inching out across the cracking ice, fireman Coyle carefully closed in on the struggling animal with a Stokes basket, a specialized stretcher, ready to carry the animal back if need be.

Struggle: Exhausted Sylvie had been in the frigid water for more than 30 minutes by the time rescue arrived

Hold on: The husky clings to the ice as firefighter Sean Coyle inches out to the hole

In safe hands: Fireman Coyle grabs Sylvie by the scuff of the neck as he attempts to lift her from the water

He managed to grab hold of the pet by the scruff of the neck and haul the animal out of the water.

Mr
 Coyle told the Boston Globe: 'She was pretty shaken up when I got to her. At that point,
 her barks had turned into whimpers. She was losing energy.'

Coyle extricated the animal, put it in
 the Stokes basket, and started heading back to shore.

Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald said the rescue carried with it significant danger for the firefighter.

'Even though weâ€™ve had cold temperatures, weâ€™ve had some periods of thawing, too,' he told the Boston Globe.

Lucky escape: The 13-year-old Husky's thick winter coat helped her stay alive in the freezing water

Soaking: The pet emerged from the water and totters on the ice as she regained her balance

After
 being plucked from the water, rescuer and dog had the risky journey back to shore, across 30 or 40 yards of brittle ice.

About
 halfway back, Coyle let the animal out of the basket, and let the
 dog to walk the rest of the way.

She bounded up to a the man who had been walking
 the dog for his niece.

Reunited with the pet, the relieved man headed home, this time with the dog on a leash.

Danger: The risks were not over once Sylvie had been plucked from the water as thinning ice meant rescuer and dog could fall back in at any second

Hold on tight: Sylvie is grabbed to prevent her heading back on to the treacherous ice

Reunited: A worried owner is reunited with his beloved pet on the banks of Castle Island's Pleasure Bay
