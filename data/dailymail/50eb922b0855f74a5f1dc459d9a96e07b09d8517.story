A brand new superyacht has been unveiled to the world for the first time ahead of being delivered to its new owner - Formula One mogul Eddie Jordan.

The Sunseeker 155 has been under development for 18 months, and will cost a total of £32million when it is finally completed.

This week it was taken out of the shed in Poole, Dorset where it is being built, as it is now too large to be housed in the hangar.

Unveiled: The Sunseeker 155 superyacht, commissioned by Eddie Jordan, has been unveiled to the public

Under construction: The boat has been moved out of the shed where it was built because it is now too large

It was transported at a glacial place by a radio-controlled unit as it was manoeuvred out of the shed with just a few inches to spare.

The four-deck yacht includes five bedrooms, enabling Mr Jordan to host up to 10 guests at once, while the boat also has space for 11 members of staff.

Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event.

The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey.

Sunseeker International, the company building the boat, expects to be able to begin testing it on the water next month, before delivering it to Mr Jordan in the spring.

But even after the businessman has taken delivery of his new pride and joy, handing over £32million in the process, the Sunseeker 155 will not come cheap.

Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time.

Despite the gigantic scale of the Sunseeker 155, it is still very far from the record for the biggest yacht in the world - the Azzam, completed last year, measures almost 600ft.

Glamorous: But the boat has a top speed of just 22 knots (25mph) due to its vast size

Vast: However, the 155ft yacht is still some way off the world record, which stands at a staggering 600ft

Stewart McIntyre, managing director at Sunseeker International, said: 'This is an extremely exciting time for Sunseeker as we inch ever closer to the completion of the 155 Yacht.

'This is the biggest project we have ever undertaken and since the announcement of its build it has been the talk of the industry.

'We are incredibly proud of what we have created and look forward to showcasing it to the world.'

Mr Jordan, who commissioned the yacht, grew up in Ireland and ran a number of racing teams before setting up Jordan Grand Prix, whose drivers included Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill.

After the team shut down in 2005, the 65-year-old became a racing commentator for the BBC.

Last year it was revealed that the Emirati royal family own the world's biggest mega-yacht, knocking Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's off the top spot.

The Chelsea owner's vessel Eclipse had been the world's biggest yacht for the past three years, but it was usurped by the 590ft Azzam, which Yachts France revealed belongs to Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nayan, President of the United Arab Emirates and Emir of Abu Dhabi and is worth £390million.

The yacht requires a staff of 50, and interior features include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior.

Abramovich's Eclipse, valued at £740million, features an armour-plated master suite, two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and even its own missile defence system.

It had in turn taken the title of world's biggest private yacht from the 454ft Rising Sun, owned by American businessman Larry Ellison, which topped the 414ft Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

Of the top 100 yachts featured in the Yachts France mega yacht league table, 31 were owned by people from the Middle East, 19 were Russian owned, and 17 belonged to Americans.
