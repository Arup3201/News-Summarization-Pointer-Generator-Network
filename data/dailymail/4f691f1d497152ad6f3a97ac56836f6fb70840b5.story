The children of mothers who smoke and breastfeed are more likely to develop serious health problems as they grow up, scientists warned yesterday.

Even a small period of exposure to nicotine in the first months of life raises the danger of illnesses such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, compared with those breastfed by non-smoking mothers.

Last night, scientists demanded better information for new mothers on the long-term effects of nicotine exposure on their children’s health.

The new research, which was carried out on rats, follows earlier studies on humans which suggested breastfeeding mothers who smoke may pass on long-term health risks to their babies.

The rats were fitted with nicotine-producing implants to model the effect of smoking during breastfeeding.

They nursed their offspring as normal and the health of the babies was monitored into adulthood.

The babies grew up to develop problems such as obesity and underactive thyroid glands – hypothyroidism – while those raised by mothers without the nicotine implant remained healthy.

 Around 5,000 babies die in the womb or shortly after birth each year in Britain as a result of their mothers smoking during pregnancy.

Yet one in four pregnant women smokes, despite warnings about the effects on their baby and widely available NHS services to help smokers quit.

Children exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb are at greater risk of a range of health disorders and cot death, as well as later behavioural problems.

The latest study looked at how nicotine exposure in the first months after birth affects cell and hormonal development.

The research team, based at the State University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, found the nicotine exposure caused a reduction in thyroid hormone levels compared with the baby rats of non-smoking mothers.

Sensitivity to the hormone leptin, which controls appetite and signals when it’s time to stop eating, was also lower in the infants of breastfeeding rats that were fitted with the nicotine implants.

It is thought that smoking in human mothers could affect the health of children in the same way.

Dr Patricia Lisboa, who led the study published in the Society for Endocrinology’s Journal of Endocrinology, said: ‘We have shown that even a small period of nicotine exposure during breastfeeding can permanently damage the future health of a child.

‘Future work on this project will investigate the addiction potential of nicotine and the neurological effects of smoking while breastfeeding on offspring.’

In the UK, warnings by doctors about the effects of smoking on the unborn baby were first made in 1971, while the first national no-smoking campaign was launched in 1974.

But Dr Lisboa says it is vital that more advice is aimed at new mothers. She said breastfeeding mums in particular had to be told: ‘Smoking during breastfeeding can be as dangerous to offspring as smoking during pregnancy.’
