With the World Cup in Brazil just months away, riot police in Rio de Janeiro have made a show of strength to deter unrest over the tournament which has seen rioting across the country.

Officers in full body armour and bearing shields faced off against 50 violent protestors - their colleagues - as part of a training exercise.

It took place next to Rio's Sambadrome, a downtown parade area, while a police helicopter hovered above and relayed information back to contollers on the ground.

The 'rioters' threw traffic cones, battered the police shield wall, who responded with tear gas.

Opposition to the cost of hosting the World Cup this summer has become a rallying cry for millions of disaffected Brazilians – who believe they are being prevented from seeing the benefits of their country’s rapid economic boom.

Last month demonstrations were held in more than 30 cities across the country, but the Sao Paulo demonstrations quickly turned violent, with more than 100 people arrested.

Many Brazilians are furious about the cost of the World Cup, saying the money should be spent on infrastructure and the poor

Student Leonardo Pelegrini dos Santos said: ‘We are against the millions and millions of dollars that are being spent for the Cup.

‘It is money that should be invested in better health and education services and better transportation and housing.’

Clashes earlier this month saw rioters seize control of Rio's main railway station as police tear gas cannister and stun grenades rained down.

A Brazilian cameraman covering the riots over bus far increases was left braindead after being hit by an explosive device.

Santiago Andrade, 49, was filming the bloody confrontation near Rio de Janeiro's central station for the Band TV channel when he was hit by the projectile, thought to have been thrown by a protester.

The World Cup is being held in Brazil from June 12 until July 13. It is the first time since 1950 the South American nation is hosting the tournament.

But the violent demonstrators were actually fellow officers and the confrontation was a drill
