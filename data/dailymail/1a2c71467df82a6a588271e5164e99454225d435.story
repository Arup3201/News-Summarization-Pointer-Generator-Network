'Regret': Andy Coulson told the hacking trial he 'regrets' his treatment of David Blunkett in 2004

Andy Coulson was accused of ‘pure hypocrisy’ yesterday over his decision to expose a senior politician’s affair while he was himself involved in an illicit relationship with Rebekah Brooks.

The former News of the World editor admitted there was an ‘irony’ in his confrontation with David Blunkett over the then Home Secretary’s relationship with married magazine publisher Kimberley Fortier.

Coulson, 46, has admitted he learned of the affair when he was played voicemail messages in which the Labour politician ‘effectively declared his love’ for the Spectator publisher, and conceded he had misled Mr Blunkett when he claimed the affair had been revealed by ‘sources’.

He told the hacking trial of his ‘regret’ over his treatment of the politician and accepted the irony of his actions, in the light of his on-off affair with Brooks, his predecessor as editor at the News of the World.

Coulson, who later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s communications director, was asked if he felt ‘shame’ about his treatment of Mr Blunkett, described in court as a ‘decent man’.

He replied: ‘This story was about someone’s love life, about them having an affair. Given what was going on in my own private life, the irony of it is not lost on me.’

David Spens QC, the lawyer for former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, responded: ‘It’s pure hypocrisy, isn’t it?’

Coulson replied again: ‘The irony is not lost on me.’

The jury has heard Coulson and Brooks were involved in an on-off affair which started in 1998 and which was rekindled while both of them were married to other people.

Coulson’s wife, Eloise, has been in court for most of his evidence.

Voicemails: Coulson admitted he learned of the affair between Blunkett and publisher Kimberley Fortier after being played voicemail messages

Coulson told the court he regretted his 
decision to tell Mr Blunkett the affair was revealed by the newspaper’s 
sources, rather than admitting it was uncovered when a journalist hacked
 his voicemail messages to his lover.

News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck played Coulson excerpts from the messages in August 2004 - the ‘first and only’ time Coulson admits hearing hacked phone messages.

The former editor was blasted for his ironic behaviour in light of his affair with Rebekah Brooks

He said he did not ask Thurlbeck how he had got the messages and did not discipline him over the apparent intrusion, but did tell him to stop. Thurlbeck has admitted phone hacking.

Coulson said he did not tell police about the Thurlbeck messages in 2006, after royal editor Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were arrested for hacking Palace aides, but has denied he was part of a cover-up.

Mr Spens, for Goodman, accused him of trying to save himself. He asked: ‘You chose not to tell police about Neville Thurlbeck hacking because you were concerned to save your own skin.’

Coulson replied: ‘I certainly accept the impact on me was a factor, but there were other factors.’

Mr Spens responded: ‘Self-preservation usually comes first doesn’t it?’

Coulson denied he put Goodman under pressure to plead guilty or that he offered him work in a bid to stop the journalist from implicating him or others at the News of the World.

Goodman and Mulcaire both admitted hacking royal aides and were jailed in 2007. Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World and was subsequently appointed as the Conservative Party’s director of communications.

Coulson and Brooks, 45, both deny charges that they were part of a six-year conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World, or that they made allegedly corrupt payments to public officials. Goodman, 56, is not accused of hacking in the current trial but also denies conspiring to pay public officials.

All seven defendants in the case deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
