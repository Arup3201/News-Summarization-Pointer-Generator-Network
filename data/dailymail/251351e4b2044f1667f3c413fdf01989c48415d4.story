Britain will get 5G internet so fast that users can download a feature film in less than a second, under a major deal struck with Germany.

David Cameron said that with the ’world on fast forward’, the UK risks being left behind without ultra-fast broadband.

Speaking at a hi-tech summit in Germany, the Prime Minister also announced £73million to develop the Internet of Things, which allow billions of everyday objects to communicate with each other online.

The deal between Britain and Germany was sealed at the CeBIT 2014 trade fair in Hanover today. It is designed to stop the two countries from falling behind more advanced nations.

The Internet of Things would allow appliances, gadgets and the devices of the future to communicate, such as power meters which automatically get customers the best deal and monitors which allow doctors to track heart rate in real time.

South Korea is expected to roll-out 5G within the next two years. 5G will allow users to download a 800-megabyte movie file in one second.

Today’s announcement includes a collaboration between the University of Dresden, King’s College University in London and the University of Surrey to develop 5G in the UK and Germany.

Mr Cameron said: ‘This is a world on fast forward. A world of permanent technological revolution.

‘And in this world, countries like the UK and Germany will only succeed if we have a relentless drive for new ideas and innovations. The UK tech scene today is dynamic. Relentlessly ambitious. Leading the way.

'It is our ambition to make the UK the most digital nation in the G8 and it is my mission to show the world that we’re getting there.’

Mr Cameron is on a two-day visit to Germany, which he will use to forge stronger ties with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

In addition to developing 5G, two leaders also want to strengthening the EU’s digital single market.

And
 Mr Cameron will hail the Internet of Things for its potential to change
 how we live our lives, unveiling another £45million funding for 
research, taking the total sum available to £73million.

Mr Cameron said: ‘These are developments that could allow literally billions of everyday objects to talk to each other over the internet – using low-cost, low-power chips.

‘And this has enormous potential to change our lives. Electricity meters that talk to the grid to get you the best deals. Health monitors that keep an eye on your heart rate. Water pipes that warn of a fall in pressure.

'I see the Internet of Things as a huge transformative development - a way of boosting productivity, of keeping us healthier, making transport more efficient, reducing energy needs, tackling climate change.

‘We are on the brink of a new industrial revolution and I want us – the UK and Germany – to lead it.

‘Take British ingenuity in software, services and design, add German excellence in engineering and industrial manufacturing and together we can lead in this new revolution.’
