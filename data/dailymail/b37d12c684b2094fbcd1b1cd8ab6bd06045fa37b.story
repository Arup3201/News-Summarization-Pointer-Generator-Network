A women's college basketball team - and their coach's one-year-old son - have spent more than 24 hours in their bus after it became stranded in four feet of snow in upstate New York.

The 25 players and coaches with Niagara University's squad were heading home after the team's loss at Pittsburgh on Monday night when their bus became stuck on the New York State Thruway near Buffalo.

After being marooned for more than 24 hours, they finally tweeted photos showing a plow clearing the road early on Wednesday and they started moving around 4am.

But before they started on their way again, Head Coach Kendra Faustin spoke to the Associated Press about their ordeal and described their panic at having very little food and water on board.

Stranded! Members of Niagara University's women's basketball team shared photos to social media after they became stuck in heavy snow on their way back from a game in Pittsburgh on Monday night

 Help! The team posted selfies and signs calling for help as they waited for 26 hours before moving

'It started to get bad fast at about 2am (Tuesday morning) and we came to a dead stop and haven't moved since,' she said. 'It was a rough weekend for us on the court and it just won't end.'

When the players realized how low they were on food, local officials dropped off snacks and drinks. Before the supplies arrived, the team had resorted to turning some of the snow into water.

'We have snacks, some granola bars and pretzels,' Faustin said. 'We found six bottles of water and have been rationing it.

'We thought we'd be here for a couple hours and a couple of hours turned into 12 hours. It's now 24 hours.'

Still smiling: There were 25 students and coaches from Niagara University's squad on board - as well as head coach Kendra Faustin's one-year-old son (they are pictured together center)

In it together: Spirits remained high, their coach said, and they eventually started moving this morning

Hanging in there: 'We have been praying each hour,' this photo's caption read. 'It has now been 24 hours'

Kindness of strangers: One of the team members shared this photo to Twitter with the caption: 'Thank you God!!! Random citizens came to bring us snacks ! Very grateful'

Stash: The student took a snap of the snacks given to them by strangers and local officials

Still, she said that the team - and her young son - had remained in good spirits and were enjoying sharing selfies and photos of the snow on social media. 

'They really have been great,' she said. 'There's been no complaining at all. They've been joking around: I want a steak, I want a soft taco, a Slurpee.'

As well as posing for pictures, players had also watched movies and the Duke-Michigan State men's basketball game on television Tuesday night, she said.

Other motorists also came on the bus seeking shelter and chatted with the team. 

'There's definitely nothing in the coaching handbook to prepare you for this,' she added. 'I'm sure when it's all done we'll look back at it and remember how great a bonding experience it was. For now, I think everyone just wants to get home and sleep in their own beds.'

Freedom! The team grinned as they traveled on a bus back to campus early on Wednesday morning

Stuck: A truck is seen stranded in the snow on a ramp leading to Route 391 in Boston, New York on Tuesday

In deep: A dog in a home in South Buffalo, New York sniffs at snow blocking a doorway on Tuesday

On Wednesday, shortly after 4am, she shared a final photo of a few relieved members of the team with the message: 'We are safe at toll plaza. Making our way to police station and then to campus.'

Just before 6am, the team's Twitter page shared a photo of the team smiling and crossing their fingers.

'On our way back to campus now!' the post read.

The bus became stranded after a massive storm dumped four feet of snow around Buffalo. At least six deaths across three states were blamed on the huge storm.
