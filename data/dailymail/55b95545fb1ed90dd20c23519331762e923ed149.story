Steve Bruce was in the mood for celebrating on Saturday night despite Arsenal's late equaliser at the Emirates.

It had looked as if Hull would be leaving the capital with all three points, only for Danny Welbeck to strike in stoppage time. 

That, however, didn't stop Bruce - who was understandably proud of his side - hotfooting it up to Manchester for Sam Allardyce's 60th birthday bash.

The 53-year-old was pictured riding the Piccadilly Line of the London underground from Arsenal, presumably to Euston train station before heading north.

Welbeck's late show was all the more galling for Bruce after he revealed the Tigers could have signed the former Manchester United striker before he eventually opted for a move to the Gunners. 

'He had a pick shall we say but, yes, we had a dabble,' Bruce said. 

'I've got no doubt in my mind after working with him that he can play at any top four side, no question. He's a top player.

'He's played a lot on the left (for United) and then people start criticising his goalscoring record, but you put him down the middle as a striker and he will score.'
