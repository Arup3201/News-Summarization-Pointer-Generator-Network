Some towns will see their population soar by more than a fifth over the next few years, according to new estimates.

The Office for National Statistics says some areas will see expansion of more than 20 per cent between 2011 and 2021, in a population boom that looks certain to engulf much of the south of the country.

The forecasts come at a time of political concern over immigration – responsible for around two thirds of current population increase – and the need for large-scale housing construction.

The Government is also facing pressure from conservation groups led by the National Trust, which says councils are now aiming to meet the pressure for development by building on Green Belt land.

According to ONS projections, the population of England will rise from 53.1 million to nearly 58 million by 2021, up 8.6 per cent on 2011 levels.

Growth will be at its slowest in the north, it says, with an increase of 4.4 per cent in the North West and 4.9 per cent in the North East.

Hart in Hampshire is the UK’s most desirable place to live for the third year in a row.

Factors such as life expectancy, crime rates, jobs and schools figure in the annual Halifax quality of life survey.

Hart had the healthiest residents – 97.4 per cent in good or fairly good health and average male life expectancy of 82.9 years against a national 79.

Nowhere in Wales or Northern Ireland made the ‘top 50’ list, but the Orkney Islands put Scotland in at number 50.

This contrasts with a projected 14.2 per cent rise in London; 10.2 per cent in the East region; and 9.3 per cent in the South East.

Population pressure will also be high in the East Midlands, which will have to make room for nearly 400,000 more people, an 8.6 per cent increase, and in the South West, where an expected extra 440,000 people will mean a 8.3 per cent rise.

Increases of more than a fifth are expected in a string of London boroughs and the districts of Welwyn Hatfield, north of London, and East Cambridgeshire.

The town of Boston in Lincolnshire, already one of the most popular destinations for immigrant workers from Poland and Eastern Europe, is set to take another 11,200 by 2021, pushing up its numbers by 17.4 per cent.

The population increases in the south and east are in line with the past impact of immigration, which over the past 15 years has seen most new arrivals heading for London and its prosperous  neighbouring areas.

Citizens from Romania and Bulgaria, will have the right to work freely in Britain from January 1, 2014.
