A millionairess dentist whose 'strong mutual antipathy’ with her 'controlling' former mother-in-law took them to the High Court has won a key dispute at the heart of her bitter divorce battle.

Anushika Sharma, 36, and her 45-year-old former husband Sunny, worked 
together running their ‘niche’ dentistry business and are believed to 
have had assets worth up to £10million.

They raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across London and the Home Counties.

When the couple divorced last year, Mrs Sharma took ownership of seven of them, which upset him and Mr Sharma's ‘strong-willed’ mother Kesh Sharma.

But Mr Sharma insisted that five of those surgeries belonged to them, but the High Court today said they did not agree.

Anushika's barrister, Alan Gourgey QC, told the court about the deep rift between her and her mother-in-law at the heart of the expensive court battle.

'At
the heart of the case, lay a strong mutual antipathy between two very 
strong-willed women, the husband's mother Kesh and the wife,' he said.

'Kesh
had been the driving force of the Sharma family businesses and she held
a dominant and highly controlling position within the Sharma 
family...she expected deference from her family, which she regarded as 
her due, both as a mother and one of the founders of the family 
fortune.'

Richard Snowden QC, for Kesh and her sons, confirmed that Anushika was 'a daughter-in-law for whom she had no warm feelings.'

Today judges sided with the younger party and handed her victory.

Mr Justice Jackson said the business had depended on her dentistry expertise and her husband’s family had invested no capital and 'no more than minimal effort' in the venture.

The case hinged on what was said at a 2007 family meeting at which it was agreed to set up a company - Aspire Dental Care Limited (ADC) - of which Anushika would be sole director. The shares in the company were to split in quarters between Anushika, Kesh, Sunny and his brother, Raj.

Over the next few years, Anushika was enormously successful in building the business, buying or setting up a string of practices on behalf of the company. However, she also took on five surgeries herself and they were the focus of the family mud-slinging in court.

Anushika said she had started her own 'parallel' company, alongside ADC, to escape 'interference' in her commercial affairs by her 'dominant and highly controlling mother-in-law'.

However, Kesh and her sons insisted she had violated her duty as a director by going it alone instead of working for the benefit of ADC. As 75 per cent shareholders, they said they were entitled to the lion’s share of the five practices.

However, dismissing their appeal, Mr Justice Jackson said it had been agreed at the meeting that Anushika would 'run the company as she saw fit'.

Observing that the whole set-up was 'extraordinarily favourable' to Kesh and her sons, he added: 'They were receiving 75% of the shares of a potentially valuable company in which they were investing neither capital nor more than minimal effort'.

Anushika not only had clinical control over the business, but also responsbility for its day-to-day management, and her view that “she did not need Kesh’s permission” to acquire new surgeries for herself was “perfectly understandable”.

He concluded that Kesh and her sons had 'with full knowledge of the material facts, acquiesced in an arrangement whereby Anushika would be free to acquire some dental practices for the company and others for herself'.
