Roy Hodgson has told the Football Association he would like to continue as England manager for a further two years and have a second crack at the World Cup.

Hodgson’s contract runs until next summer’s European Championship and no formal discussions have taken place to extend his deal.

But Hodgson is enjoying the job, with his England side six points clear at the top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group after four straight wins.

He has told senior members of the FA that, even at 67, he does not feel ready to retire.

Hodgson is said to feel he has unfinished business after such a disappointing World Cup in Brazil last year and he would like to put his experience to good use in Russia in 2018.

Hodgson certainly has significant support at Wembley. He received the backing of FA chairman Greg Dyke after England’s early exit in Brazil and he also enjoys a close working relationship with Dan Ashworth, the FA technical director who worked with Hodgson at West Bromwich Albion. The FA will wait until a new chief executive has been appointed, who will, along with Dyke and Ashworth decide Hodgson’s future.

It could well be that the FA take the sensible option of delaying a final decision until after Euro 2016 in France.

Recently Hodgson hinted publicly that he does not feel ready to retire.

‘At the moment I feel good and I don’t feel anything like my age,’ he said. ‘I hope that will continue for a few more years.

‘I am confident that I will know what the right time is. But I have an important job to do which I really enjoy, so as for 2018 and 2020 we will see.’
