Brian Charrington was arrested in Spain by police targeting cocaine smuggling between Europe and South America

A suspected British drugs baron, described as 'one of the top ten most investigated criminals in Europe', has 
been arrested in Spain accused of trying to smuggle cocaine into Europe.

Brian Charrington, 57, a former 
associate of notorious gangster Curtis Warren, was detained along with 
his son on the Costa Blanca near Alicante.

The former Middlesbrough car 
dealer's girlfriend, who detectives allege had travelled to Venezuela to 
organise a shipment of cocaine back to Europe on a yacht, has also been 
held.

More details of the 
police operation, which led to the seizure of 485 pounds (220 kilos) of cocaine worth
£10million at an apartment in Albir near Benidorm, were due to be given
later today at a press briefing in Madrid.

Britain's Serious Organised Crime 
Agency, Venezuelan police and a regional 18-member-state police 
organisation called Ameripol set up to fight drugs trafficking, were 
also involved.

Seven people were arrested in Spain and six in Venezuela during the joint operation.

Spanish police described Charrington 
today as 'one of the ten most investigated criminals' by European police
forces and 'leader of an international gang of drugs smugglers.'

A court on the Costa Blanca has embargoed bank accounts, property and other assets worth more than £5million.

Two years ago his fortune was put at £20million.

In the eighties he teamed up with Curtis
Warren, whose personal fortune was so large he appeared on the Sunday 
Times Rich List, to import cocaine to the UK from Venezuela.

The pair were arrested in early 1992 
after a shipment of almost 2,000 pounds (900 kilos) of cocaine sealed inside lead 
ingots in steel boxes was discovered.

The subsequent trial collapsed after it transpired Charrington was a police informant for the North-East Regional Crime Squad.

Britain's security forces went on to re-home him in Australia but his visa was revoked shortly after his arrival.

He then moved to Spain where he is accused of building up a drugs empire.

Charrington was acquitted in two drugs trials 
in the UK before being extradited to Germany and sentenced to seven 
years jail in 2003 for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the country.

His son Brian Charrington Jr served four years and three months.

Charrington senior was extradited to 
France following his release in 2006 to serve a two year prison term 
over the discovery of 1,433 pounds (650 kilos) of hashish found on his yacht in the 
English Channel in 1995.

In 2004 he lost a civil suit against 
the Assets Recovery Agency over more than £2million found in his loft 
which he and Curtis Warren disputed the ownership of.

His arrest is the third high-profile detention of a British criminal by Spanish police in the past three months.

Earlier this month wanted drugs 
trafficker Mark Lilley was arrested naked at a panic room in his luxury 
villa in Alhaurin de la Torre near Malaga.

The 41-year-old, originally from 
Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, is expected to be extradited to the UK 
within weeks to start a 23-year-jail sentence.

Spain remains a popular destination for British criminals, who exploited the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries for several years until 1985.
