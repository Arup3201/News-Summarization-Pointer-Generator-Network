Volatile volcano Mount Etna has been blowing perfect 'smoke' rings into Sicily's blue skies.

The volcano erupted violently on November 11 and since then has produced regular explosions, as well as hundreds of perfect vortex rings.

While theories abound, scientists are not entirely sure why the volcano is able to blow the circular puffs of steam - although some think a circular vent could be the cause.

Volatile volcano Mount Etna has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on November 11 and has since produced regular explosions, as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings

Some of the smoke rings measure hundreds of feet in diameter, according to Volcano Discovery.

German volcanologist Dr Tom Pfeiffer, who founded the volcano watching website and runs tours of active volcanoes, said dozens of smoke rings were blown eastwards by a strong wind.

He believes the reason for the unusual smoke-like formations is because the violent eruption had changed the structure of a vent – perhaps into a particularly circular shape that allowed the volcano to make the steam rings, which he said are a ‘rare phenomenon'.

Writing on the website, he said: ‘Being 
Etna, she exaggerates: Not only one ring every now and then, but she 
made dozens if not hundreds during a few hours, often in a row.’

In 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings, Two volcanologists, said they could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere. More recent rings are pictured

It is not the first time that Etna has managed to produce the circular smoke rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000.

Mount Etna is the tallest and most active
 volcano in Europe and is situated on the geological boundary where the 
European and African plates collide.

In
 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings, Two
 volcanologists, Drs Jurg Alean and Maro Fulle, told the BBC: ‘They [the rings] could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere.

‘The physics seems somewhat complicated and we are trying to establish if there are sound scientific theories about them.’

The pair run a monitoring station and keep a photographic record of the volcano’s activity.

Other experts have theories about why the rings of steam are produced.

Writing on Fiboni blog, Sana Lane said steam rings above volcanoes typically measure between 100m and 200m across.

She said 'vortex rings' are formed when air mixes with steam or smoke, having been forced out of a small circular opening.

Because there is a bottleneck at the opening, the air in the centre if forced out faster, which creates a circular motion to form a vortex.

The shape of the ring is maintained because of the rotational motion of the air so the rings need the right shaped opening and velocity to form.

Mount Etna is not the only volcano to have created the curious rings and Stromboli in Italy, Hekla in Iceland and Mount Aso in Japan are also said to have produced steam rings.

Mount Etna is an active volcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, close to the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies on a convergent plate margin between the African plate and the Erasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano on the European continent at 3,329m high

When Etna started to erupt last month (pictured) none of the villages of Catania, dotted around the mountain, needed to be evacuated, though airspace over the southern Italian island was briefly closed

More than 25 per cent of Sicily's population lives on Etna's slopes, and it is the main source of income for the island - a combination of agriculture, due to its rich volcanic soil, and tourism. Here, Etna is pictured erupting last month
