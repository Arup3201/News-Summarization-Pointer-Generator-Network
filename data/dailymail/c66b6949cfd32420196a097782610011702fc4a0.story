A Latvian man who left a baby girl with a serious brain injury after smashing a lorry into a car driven by her police officer father has been jailed for nine months.

Warehouse worker Gendrihs Kuplovs-Okinskis, 44, of Southend, admitted he had not driven a lorry in a long time but claims his bosses at Peacock Foods ordered him to get behind the wheel of a bread delivery truck or lose his job.

He veered into the path of oncoming traffic and smashed into a Vauxhall Zafira driven by off-duty policeman David Moon.

The Vauxhall was destroyed in the September 6 accident and Maisie, aged 15 months at the time, suffered serious head injuries and had to be flown to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for life-saving treatment.

The two-year-old is still receiving physiotherapy and speech therapy as a result of her injuries.

Mr Moon suffered a broken rib and his other daughter, Ella, was left with cuts and bruises.

Samantha Leigh, prosecuting, told 
Chelmsford Crown Court Kuplovs-Okinskis, who has an HGV licence, 
over-corrected after avoiding low-hanging branches on a road in Earls 
Colne, Essex. He was not speeding and the lorry was found to have no 
defects.

Shauna Ritchie, mitigating, told the court Kuplovs-Okinskis had a valid licence to drive HGVs in his native Latvia and in the UK, but had not driven a lorry for a significant period.

He was pressed into service as a driver by his boss at short notice, the court heard.

Mrs Ritchie said: 'He is hard working and has been trying to make his way in this country. He did not wish to drive as part of his employment.

'This is an unusual case of dangerous driving because the bad driving was not prolonged, persistent, deliberate or aggressive.

'No sentence can compensate the Moon family for what they have been through, but custody will do no better.

'He says it was his mistake and one he will always regret. He should have said no to driving and taken the consequences himself.

'He genuinely struggles to live with what he has done.'

Kuplovs-Okinskis admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for nine months and banned from driving for two years.

Judge John Dodd QC, addressing Kuplovs-Okinskis, said: 'No sentence I can pass can properly address the gravity of the injuries caused.

'I accept you have expressed real and profound remorse for your actions and the consequences.

'You made the fateful decision to take the wheel of a lorry at the insistence of your employer and the prosecution and the defence agree you were placed under inappropriate pressure.'

The court heard the police have taken action against Peacock Foods in Halstead, Essex for not holding an operator's licence.

Mr Moon, speaking after the hearing, said: 'It is nice the case has finished and we can close the book and go back to caring for Maisie and what she is going to need as she gets older.

'She is doing really well. She is recovering well but things with the brain injury are only just showing, which we were warned would be the case.'
