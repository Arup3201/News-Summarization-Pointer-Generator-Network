Any Premier League clubs hoping to lure Jurgen Klopp to England were dealt a blow after Borussia Dortmund reiterated that the club has full faith in their under-pressure manager.

Klopp guided Dortmund to Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 but has struggled this season with 10 defeats from 17 games - leaving the former champions second-bottom in the table going in to the winter break.

Nonetheless, general manager Hans-Joachim Watzke told the Bild paper on Tuesday: 'We are fully convinced of him.'

Watzke went on to say that he has 'zero point zero doubts' that Klopp still controls the dressing room and dismissed introducing a deadline to lift the team to safety as 'perverse' saying the 47-year-old's position would not change.

Following a crisis meeting with Klopp and sporting director Michael Zorc, Watzke said: 'There are zero doubts. We are totally convinced of him. A few weeks ago he was praised into the skies, and the very same people now say that his time is over. I think that's just embarrassing.' 

The general manager also hinted the manager would be backed in the January market where players who were not fully committed would be replaced.

'It's not ruled out that we'll do a bit in the next few days,' Watzke told Bild - adding that 'there are no taboos in the other direction as well.'

Dortmund sold South Korean Ji Dong Won to Augsburg on Monday while bringing in Slovenia midfielder Kevin Kampl from Red Bull Salzburg - who claims to have supported BVB since his childhood.

'It's great that it worked out,' the forward said on Sky. 

'I am delighted. I have been a BVB fanatic as a kid, and it's a dream fulfilled to be able to play for such an outstanding club.'
