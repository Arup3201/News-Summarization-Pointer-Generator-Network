A mother of three is facing death after being refused a breakthrough cancer treatment.

Kathy Craven, 43, who has been fighting breast cancer for five years, was denied the treatment because of a recent NHS funding clampdown.

Just two months ago, she would have got a new type of radiation therapy, but she was not referred to hospital until it was too late.

She had gone to her GP surgery 15 times with telltale symptoms that her cancer had spread to her liver – but was told  she was probably too young for that to have happened.

The therapy, which could halve Mrs Craven’s tumours, was cut from the Cancer Drugs Fund list of treatments in April.

In a further bitter twist, the radiation would even save the NHS money as it costs less than the chemotherapy she is having – which is failing to work.

Now Mrs Craven, her partner Brian Russell, 47, and three boys, Alfie, 13, Finn, eight, and seven-year-old Casey are determined not to lose the chance of spending more time together.

She said: ‘Time is of the essence, and I don’t understand why I and women like me can be refused funding – it is grossly unfair.

‘When this nightmare started and I had to tell my boys that I had cancer, I promised them that I would do everything and anything in my power to stay with them for as long as I possibly could. I was elated when I discovered there was a real chance of extending my life, but it has turned to despair.

‘My oncologist says I need to be treated within the next month, and I will fight this decision – I am fighting for my life.’

Mrs Craven, who lives near Wimborne, Dorset, had pinned her hopes on a breakthrough treatment called Selective Internal Radiation Therapy, known as SIRT, in which millions of tiny radioactive beads are injected into the artery that supplies the cancer.

Battle: Selective Internal Radiation Therapy only became available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund two years ago after a fight by doctor Becky Smith (pictured), who was denied it by a local trust. She died last year

She eventually got treatment after a U-turn but died in May last year. Since then SIRT has been axed pending a review – a decision which could stop up to 500 patients getting it this year.

Doctors can make funding requests for ‘exceptional’ patients, but two attempts to get treatment for Mrs Craven have been rejected.

When first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, aged 39, she made the brave decision to also have her healthy breast removed because cases of cancer in the family meant odds were stacked against her.

Despite the operation, by October 2010 Mrs Craven felt very unwell and feared the cancer had spread. But it took 15 visits to GPs and a private CT scan before a huge mass was found on her liver.

She said she was ‘over the moon’ when her doctor said SIRT treatment might reduce the liver tumours by 50 per cent and prolong her life ‘by many months’.

But Mrs Craven’s medical team at hospitals in Poole and Southampton were told last week by NHS England, which oversees such requests, they were not allowed  to treat her.

She said: ‘I was so shocked. I didn’t think it would be a problem as the NHS is paying for my chemo which is very expensive and isn’t working. What can I do to be more “exceptional”?

'I still have three children at school.’ The family now face the daunting task of raising £45,000 for private treatment – when the NHS cost is around £14,000.

She added: ‘My grandmother, who is now expected to outlive her granddaughter, always said “Value your health”… I just wish the NHS would give me the chance to do that.’
