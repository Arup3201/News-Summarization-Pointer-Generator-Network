Singer Katie Melua has spoken of how she was 'spooked and shocked' after she was mugged for her smartphone in London.

Thieves ripped her iPhone 5 from her hands as she walked from a Notting Hill recording studio to her home in Holland Park.

Miss Melua, who was singing last night for the Queen at the Coronation Gala at Buckingham Palace, is the latest celebrity to become a victim of street robbers.

She said: 'It was quite late, but with the weather being so gorgeous I thought a stroll would be great.

'And because I’m not familiar with the backstreets, I was holding my phone out in front of me and following the directions on a map home.

'I heard running steps behind me and before I could turn to see who it was, I felt their hands grab mine and wrestle my phone out of my grip.'

The 28-year-old Georgian-born singer, who is married to superbike champion James Toseland, managed to escape unhurt from the incident on Monday.

She said: 'I was spooked and shocked, but I’m relieved they didn’t take my bag, too.

'Afterwards, I went up to a couple nearby and asked them to walk with me and help me find a taxi.'

Miss Melua is said to be treating the incident as a 'life lesson', according to the London Evening Standard.

Her manager Mike Batt told the paper: 'She has bounced back and just taken it as a life lesson - something she shouldn't do now.'

In recent months, mugging victims have included Annette Mason, wife of Pink Floyd star Nick, who had her phone ripped from her hands as she walked across Hampstead Heath.
