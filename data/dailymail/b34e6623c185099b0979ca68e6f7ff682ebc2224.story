DIY: Celebrity builder Tommy Walsh has teamed up with Poundland for a range of tools costing £1 each

The price of hitting yourself on the thumb or hanging wallpaper upside down has just got cheaper.

For Poundland is launching a range of 200 DIY essentials from hammers to packs of paint brushes and screwdrivers - and yes, they all cost no more than £1.

The thriving budget chain has signed a partnership with celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who appeared alongside Alan Titchmarsh in the BBC’s Changing Rooms, to develop and test the range.

Recent reports from major DIY warehouses suggest many young adults don’t have the skills or the interest in home make-overs or doing jobs around the home.

However, Mr Walsh insists people can save a fortune by avoiding the need for tradesmen if they have their own tools and make sure they plan their jobs carefully.

He claims the items in the range are at least five to six times more expensive at the major DIY chains. He gave the example of a three piece professional paint brush set, which would be at £5-£6 at a leading shop.

Other items include a 7.5m tape measure and 20g tube of superglue, as well as a 1m spirit level, paint rollers and trays, masking tape, a five pack of screwdrivers and the 330g tubes of all-purpose filler and mastic.

‘The cost of calling out a tradesman or even buying tools for small home improvements can mount up quickly,’ Mr Walsh said.

‘DIY should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Customers can fill their toolbox with all the essentials they need for as little as £10.’

The range has been trialled by tradesmen who decorate and carry out repairs for a living to ensure it is robust and easy to use. The grips have been ergonomically designed so the hand tools are easy to use for long periods without causing blisters.

The decision by Poundland to move into DIY comes just as some of the big names are closing outlets, following a fall in trade. Homebase is shutting 80 stores amid claims today’s home makers do not know how to do even simple jobs like putting up a shelf or a curtain pole.

Budget: The chain hopes to step in to the gap left by floundering 

Poundland has helped DIY novices by splitting the range into four colour coded categories - ‘Decorating Essentials’ in red, ‘Adhesives’ in blue, ‘Toolbox Essentials’ in yellow and ‘Fixtures and Fittings’ in orange.

Each pack will provide tips from Mr Walsh on how to carry out the corresponding DIY task.

The partnership with the celebrity builder is part of a wider trend by the budget chain to bring in middle income shoppers.

It already offers Jane Asher bakeware range, which has achieved double its predicted sales, while there are beauty products that have been well received by the fashion press, and jewellery.

Poundland chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘Purchasing DIY products can be very expensive. We believe we have identified a gap in the market and can challenge other retailers with our more affordable products.

‘Tommy’s range offers outstanding value for money and will make home improvement accessible for everyone no matter what their budget.’
