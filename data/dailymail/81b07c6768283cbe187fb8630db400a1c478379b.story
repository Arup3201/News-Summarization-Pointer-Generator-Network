Manny Pacquiao is not only one of the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers in the world but a master of understatement.

Such is the modesty of the multi-tasking Filipino – he is also a congressman, the world's shortest professional basketball player, a singer, actor and philanthropist – that he describes the up-coming richest event in boxing history like this:

'I can say this will be one of the most important fights in my career.'

Manny Pacquiao says the fight with Floyd Mayweather will be one of the biggest in his career

Pacquiao spoke to CNN's Ivan Watson in an exclusive interview, where he spoke about the May 2 fight

Yes he could say that, since for their exploits in Las Vegas on May 2 he and Floyd Mayweather are expected to share a $300million (£218m) purse ($180m (£131m) to the Money Man, $120m (£87m) to the PacMan).

Pacquaio, in an exclusive interview with CNN, also reveals that the eldest of his five children played a major part in urging him to keep pursuing Mayweather for the showdown which is expected to draw a record US pay-per-view audience of four to five million buys.

'My son and daughter really wanted this fight to happen and they will be in the front row,' he says of the $6,000-plus seats he has reserved for them and his wife Jinker at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

'Three years ago they said 'Daddy, I want you to fight Mayweather. I want you to fight Mayweather.' I said, 'Why? It's not my fault he doesn't want to fight.'

'Finally now it's happened. And they really, really want to watch.

'It's been five years in the making…and finally it's happening. The fans deserve it.'

Of his massive pay-day, the PacMan says: 'I feel blessed and I owe a lot to those fans. First to God but also the fans because of their support.'

This highest of all his multi-million pay-days – a good proportion of which will be donated to the poor in his homeland - will not result in his offspring being spoiled.

To help teach their children to appreciate the life they now enjoy, the man who rose from poverty to an unprecedented eight world titles in different divisions and his wife have moved them from an academy for international students to a school with no air conditioning.

He says: 'I want them to experience, so they can meet hungry families. So they will not mistreat other people or treat other people differently.' 

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau on November 23, 2014
