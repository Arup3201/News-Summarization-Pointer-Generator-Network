Revelations: A book written by Amanda Knox 'will shock you the core', according to the lawyer

A book written by Amanda Knox 'will shock you the core', according to the lawyer who set up her $4m publishing deal.

Robert Barnett insisted the autobiography 'Waiting to be Heard' will still be published next month despite an Italian court ordering a re-trial for Knox.

The decision by Italy's highest court to overturn the 25 year old's acquittal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher will also have no effect on her first TV interview to be broadcast on April 30th.

Barnett said Knox's book about her arrest, trial and eventual release from jail in Italy is 'very parents nightmare.'

He hinted that the book will contain major revelations that will help sway public opinion in favour of Knox.

He said:'People will see when Amanda Knox goes public with her interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC [on April 30] that she is mature beyond her years.

'She is extremely smart. She has taken a set of experiences that are almost impossible to imagine and learned from them and marched through them with incredible dignity and respect.

'What she went through is in some ways every parent's nightmare, if not every person's nightmare. She was caught up in a set of terrible circumstances that were not her doing and lost 4½ years of her young life to an inappropriate and improper conviction.

Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday

'While people know the story of the trial, they don't know the personal story, the family's story, the prison story and, believe it or not, the legal story.'

Decision: Knox is to face a retrial over the  2007 murder of Meredith Kercher

He added to The Hollywood Reporter:'Aspects of that revealed in the book will shock you to the core.'

Barnett helped negotiate an estimated $4m advance for 25 year old Knox following her return to her home in Seattle, Washington, from prison in Perugia, Italy.

The Washington DC based lawyer has previously negotiated book deals for former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary.

Yesterday Amanda Knox collapsed and had to be 
supported by her boyfriend when she was told she would face a 
retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher.

The
 American was at home with her family in Seattle when she received a 
phone call at 2am telling her an Italian court had quashed her acquittal
 for the killing.

She 
was shattered by the news, and turned to her lover James Terrano in an 
attempt to 'keep positive' despite the new development.

Knox,
 25, will not voluntarily return to Italy to stand trial, and is 
unlikely to be extradited by her native U.S. - she will therefore 
probably be tried in absentia.

The colour ran from her face as she heard the news,' a source told the Sun.

Her lawyer phoned her family home in 
the early hours of the morning after she had gathered relatives and 
friends together to wait for confirmation of the court's decision.

Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four 
years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds 
DNA evidence was flawed

'She hugged James and then the rest of the family,' the source said. 'They are trying to keep positive but it is hard.'

Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year.

Judges
 accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case, quashing the 
acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 
29.

In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, 
who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared, were 
told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old 
British student.

Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her 
home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to 
appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at 
all.

er lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said: 
‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial. Her home is in 
Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’

He added that the decision to order a 
new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he 
said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’

Within minutes of the ruling, Knox 
issued a statement condemning it. The girl known worldwide by her 
self-awarded nickname 'Foxy Knoxy' said: ‘It was painful to receive the 
news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for 
revision when the prosecution’s theory of my involvement in Meredith’s 
murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and 
unfair.

‘I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution.

‘The prosecution responsible for the 
many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for 
Raffaele’s sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith’s
 family.’
