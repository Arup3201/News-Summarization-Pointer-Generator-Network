Temporary tattoos may be all the rage again thanks to Beyoncé - but it seems they're not just for humans.

A new brand creates body art just for horses, helping transform equine friends into  My Little Ponies.

The Glamourati stencilled designs claim to be ideal for the horse and rider who like to stand out from the crowd.

Glittery tattoos for horses are brainchild of Sally Rees from Coventry, who took inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter-marking. Designs are applied using stencils and last up to two weeks

Created by mother of two Sally Rees, 40, from Coventry, the temporary tattoos can last from a day to two weeks, depending on the glue used to apply them.

The glue doesn't touch the horse's skin, so vets say it's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap, water and a brush.

Sally, a former beauty spa director, came up with the idea for the sparkly marks while looking for a way to generate extra income after becoming a mother-of-two. 

She explains: 'I used to be the managing director of a beauty spa until 2009 when I gave it up to look after my two young children. 

'I had been dabbling with different ideas to bring a bit more money in when I came across someone doing glitter tattoos at a craft fair.

'My daughter fell in love with them straight away and so I started doing them at children's parties.

'About a year ago my in-laws from Ireland were visiting and knowing they have horses I just said: "I don't know why no-one has made these for horses".

'It was a light-bulb moment for me - the more I thought about it the more it seemed like a good idea.

'I started to look into it and realised there was a real gap in the market.'

A year after her eureka moment, Sally has turned her idea into a fully-fledged business.

She is now turning horses into real life My Little Ponies after inventing temporary tattoos for the animals made from glitter.

The savvy 'horse beautician' has taken inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter-marking.

The art involves the hair on a horse's rear quarter being brushed into patterns for show.

Sally has dubbed her venture 'quarter-marketing' - as brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses.

Different colourways suit different horses for dramatic effects

The tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture, and Sally said the products have been popular with horse owners and have been approved by vets.

She said: 'We spent a lot of time developing an adhesive that was long lasting but easily washed off. 

'We then tried out our new products on some horses at our local riding school and they were an instant hit. 

'Quarter-marketing': Brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses.

Temporary: The pictures last a day or two weeks depending on the glue used

'We then had a stall at a big horse show and we had queues of people waiting to get glitter tattoos on their horses.

'The glitter kits are completely safe to use - they have been given the thumbs up by vets.

'Glitter and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too.

'When the sun comes out you can't describe how amazing the glitter tattoos look.'

Sally's equestrian glitter tattoo kits cost between £19.99 and £59.99 and can be bought from her website glamouratiuk.com

Riders can emblazon the horse's name on their side using glitter
