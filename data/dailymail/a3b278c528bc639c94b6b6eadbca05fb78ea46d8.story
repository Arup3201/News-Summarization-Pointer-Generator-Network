ARTURO VIDAL LATEST

United have failed in their attempt to lure Vidal to Manchester with a £30m bid.

Juventus are unmoved by the offer, which sources say was made on Friday, and the Turin club want the midfielder to remain in Serie A for at least another year. 

Juventus officials set an August 15 deadline for reaching any agreement, and felt leaving it so late gave insufficient time for recruiting an adequate replacement. 

The powerhouse will not be the answer to United's midfield woes.

WILLIAM CARVALHO LATEST

Calvalho appears to have poured cold water on his £20m move to United and Arsenal.

The Sporting Lisbon defender has a buy-out clause of £37m but  the Portuguese club were open to a more reasonable bid. The 22-year-old, though, announced his wish to stay put.

'I have a deal with Sporting and I am a player of Sporting,' he said. 

'My present is this club and I am feeling very good with Sporting. It really has not entered my head to leave Sporting on the last day.'

KENNETH VERMEER LATEST

More doom and gloom for United as their bid for Ajax goalkeeper Vermeer is rejected.

The Ajax stopper, who would have provided cover for first-choice David De Gea, has agreed to join fellow Dutch outfit Feyenoord instead. 

The 28-year-old was in the original squad for Van Gaal's Netherlands at this summer's World Cup, but failed to make the final 23 due to Jasper Cillessen's fine form.
