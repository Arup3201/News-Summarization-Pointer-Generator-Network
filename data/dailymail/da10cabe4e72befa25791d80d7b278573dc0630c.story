He is the man in charge of making sure the nation’s finances add up.

But George Osborne has ducked a simple maths quiz during while being grilled on TV by schoolchildren.

The Chancellor refused point blank to say what seven times eight equals, claiming he has ‘a rule in life’ not to answer maths questions.

Mr Osborne appeared on Sky News to face questions from a panel of children readers of the First News newspaper.

Seven-year-old Samuel Reddings challenged him: ‘What’s seven times eight.’

But the Chancellor responded: 'Look I'm not going to get into a whole string of... I've made it a rule in life not to answer a whole load of maths questions.’

Mr Osborne said he had studied maths at A-Level and often been 'tested at school'.

He added: ‘Of course there is a lot of maths in my job but it also about making judgements about where the Government should spend its money.’

With the economy now growing at a faster rate than any major country, Mr Osborne’s reputation has been in the ascendancy.

But he admitted that he wishes he had done more to repair the damage caused by the 2007 crash.

He appeared taken aback when asked what his biggest regret had been from his time in government.

He suggested that the scale of the economic challenge Britain faced in 2010 meant he wished he could have doe more to deal to put the country back on track. 

‘Wow.... What decision do I regret most? I think what is true is that when you get into office that's your best opportunity to take some really big decisions,’ he said.

'And we did take some big decisions because then you've got a few years to see them played out.

'But actually I look back and think there's even more we could have done to fix some of the economic problems and I want to go on therefore taking decisions that will help create jobs for you and your families and make sure the country is more prosperous.

'If anything, it's like I wish we'd done even more. But that’s aright we are doing more now.'

However, he gave no detail of what additional efforts to encourage he wishes he had taken.

The Chancellor also revealed he wishes he could have done more to help the economy

One his own family’s finances, he said his children received pocket money without having to help around the house.

He revealed he saved his own pocket money for a Scalextric set, adding: ‘I spent it most of the time but I did save up for a Scalextric set.

‘Computers games were only just starting. Scalextric, I think it is still around, this was where you could race cars around an electric track and it was quite expensive.

'I remember I really wanted one and so I asked for money especially for my birthday to get one and saved up some of my pocket money to get this Scalextric set.'

The Chancellor, who was this week pictured singing along to the Monty Python live show at the O2, struggled when quizzed about rap music.

He said he preferred 'quite cheesy pop songs' including Pharrell Williams who he listens to while jogging in a park.
