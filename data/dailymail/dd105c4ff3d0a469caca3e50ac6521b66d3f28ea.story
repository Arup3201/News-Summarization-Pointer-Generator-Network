Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is not anything like Mario Kart – a statement that may come as a shock to some, but is – in fact, wholly justified.

For developers Sumo Digital have not simply repackaged Nintendo’s winning formula, but have carved their own niche.

The result is a wonderful, often moving, tribute to the golden age of gaming – a high speed trip down memory lane exploring the titles which shaped video game history.

Vibrant: Graphics stay true to each one of SEGA's masterpieces, while giving them a current-gen twist.

Thankfully, every bit of SEGA’s work has been handled with respect and care. You’ll race across the aircraft carrier decks made famous in Afterburner, meander through the orange canyons of Panzer Dragoon, and weave through rivers of lava in Golden Axe.

The visuals, too, are exceptional – striking a perfect balance between achieving nostalgia without taking away from each one’s distinct artistic direction.

Colours are vibrant, draw distances impressive and every mascot has been lovingly restored in pixel-perfect glory.

Refreshingly, gameplay has had as much love and care spent on it, too. For starters, it doesn’t simply involve driving around in a cart. Instead, your vehicle can transform into a boat or plane to adapt to the ever-changing levels.

Laps are rarely the same, and see you gliding through the skies one minute, and tackling waves the next.

All vehicles handle very differently. In cart mode, you can drift around corners to accumulate boost, while you’re encouraged to zip through checkpoints when in plane form. Boats bob up and down gleefully, handling in a way reminiscent of Wave Racer.

It’s this variation in gameplay that makes the career mode so enjoyable – all too often the weakest hand in these sort of games.

There’s even an XP system, which allows you to upgrade your character and their vehicle. Other modes include World Tour, Grand Prix and Battle Arenas.

Multiplayer, though, is where most of the fun is – both offline or when taking on up to 10 players online.

Old favourites: There's a large roster of SEGA stars to choose from, each with their own powers and cart.

Although graphics and frame rate take a hit when competing in split-screen mode, there are wonderfully inventive party modes (that are best left a surprise), as well as more traditional racing.

That’s what best describes All-Stars Racing…’a surprise’. A game that stands head and shoulders above every carting game of recent years, and one – like the titles it pays tribute to – will be remembered and cherished.
