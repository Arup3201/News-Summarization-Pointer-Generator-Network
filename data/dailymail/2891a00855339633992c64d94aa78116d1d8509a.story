Comedian Drew Carey is offering to help police find those involved in dumping a bucket of urine and faeces on a special-needs teen in Ohio who was reportedly told the prank was part of the Ice Bucket Challenge.

The Cleveland native posted on his Twitter account Saturday that he's willing to donate $10,000 if police in suburban Bay Village want to start a reward fund.

The 14-year-old boy's mother found a cellphone video of teenagers dumping the bucket on her autistic son.

Help: Comedian Drew Carey is offering to help police find those involved in dumping a bucket of urine and faeces on a special-needs teen in Ohio

Tweet: Drew Carey tweeted if Bay Village PD wants to start a reward fund to find who did this contact me. I'll donate $10k.

Bay Village High School organized a 
vigil for the teen before a football game on Friday and school officials
 have condemned the prank.

Carey is the host of the popular game show The Price is Right and starred in the comedy The Drew Carey Show.

The Bay Village Police Department launched an investigation into the incident Wednesday after watching the video.

Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy 
from Ohio has agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing 
that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him 

Humiliating:
 Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a 
mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts

Revolting: The victim had no ideas about the contents of the bucket until it was too late 

Detective Kevin Krolkosky said the youths suspected of bullying the 15-year-old could face criminal delinquency charges.

The teen's family said they want the teens behind the twisted ALS challenge held accountable.

‘The
 bucket challenge is supposed to be raising awareness for this disease 
and now they’ve turned it into a sick joke,’ Diane said. ‘I just can’t 
understand why kids would do something this cruel.’

Horrified: The 15-year-old's mother, Diane, later discovered the shocking video on her son's phone 

Furious: The boy's parents and his older 
brother (center) now want the bullies responsible for the sickening 
bucket challege held accountable for their actions
