A trio of teenage girls have been arrested after they allegedly attacked a 12-year-old boy with a bottle of ketchup.

Police said the boy let a group of four teenage girls into his home in Chicago, where he had been watching television, when they arrived and asked if they could use the bathroom at around 9pm on Wednesday night.

When he turned his back one of the girls hit him in the back with a glass ketchup bottle, while two others searched the kitchen and bedrooms, eventually leaving with money, jewellery and cell phones, police said.

Arrested: Vanessa Mejia, 17, and Sendi Ocampo, 18, were arrested and charged with home invasion and armed robbery in Palatine, Chicago

The boy was taken to Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights after the incident with multiple, non life-threatening cuts.

Bottle: The girls brought a glass ketchup bottle to the 12-year-old boy's apartment

Vanessa Mejia, 17, and Sendi Ocampo, 18, both of Palatine, were arrested and charged with home invasion and armed robbery.

A 16-year-old girl accused of cutting the boy with the ketchup bottle is being charged as a juvenile, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.

A fourth female suspect remains at large, police said.

Police said all three charged teenagers voluntarily went to police headquarters and gave verbal and written confessions two days after the attack. A fourth suspect remains at large.

Officers said one of the four girls had gone to the boy's apartment in East Osage Lane alone at around 9pm on Wednesday night, and claimed to be a friend of his sister.

She left when the boy told her his sister was not at home.

She returned accompanied by the other three girls around 10 minutes later, and asked to use the bathroom.

It was at then that the girl lashed out at the boy with the empty ketchup bottle she had brought with her, police said.

'It was a pretty big cut,' Sergeant Dave Weeks said of the boy's injuries.

Jewellery, two cell phones and $50 were taken during the alleged home invasion, said officers, who added that no-one else was hurt.

Police were called when the 12-year-old victim's sister returned home and discovered her brother's injuries.

She was able to identify the four girls as former friends, police said.
