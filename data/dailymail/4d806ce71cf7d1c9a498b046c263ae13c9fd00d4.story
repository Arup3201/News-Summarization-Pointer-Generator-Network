Crowds of shoppers pushed and shoved their way into Aldi supermarkets to get their hands on the store's own tablet which went on sale today.

At one branch in Old Kent Road, South London, hundreds of people clambered to get hold of the tablet when they discovered there were only 12 gadgets left in the store.

The launch has opened up a festive price war with other high street brands by launching the tablet which costs just £79.

Rush: Hundreds of people pushed to get through the doors of Aldi in Tottenham which today launched its Christmas alternative to the iPad - a £70 tablet called the Lifetab

Customers couldn't wait to get their hands on Aldi's latest gadget - its own version of the iPad which is just a snip of the price at £79

Success: Tes was the first person to buy the Aldi Lifetab gadget at the Old Kent Road store in south London

Tesco has already enjoyed huge success with its low-priced Hudl tablet, which launched in September.

But at £119 it is now far more expensive than the Lifetab.

Experts
said that while the quality of budget options might not compare with 
Apple’s original tablet computer, the affordability factor would lead to
a rush of new sales.

Tony Cripps, of technology analysts Ovum, said: ‘It is a real threat to anyone in the tablet market.’

Aldi's Lifetab E7316, created with electronics firm Medion, may be cheaper but it has just 8GB of storage - half that of Tesco's tablet

When
it launched Tesco’s Hudl was the cheapest tablet on the market and sold
incredibly well, with supermarkets shifting 35,000 models in  the first
48 hours, and it has sold out twice since. 

Last week nearly every colour model, other than purple, is shown as ‘currently unavailable’ on Tesco’s website, and a number of accessories aren’t available either.

This has raised fears customers may not be able to get hold of the cut-price gadget in time for Christmas.

Yet, the company has dismissed claims that the shortfall is due to supply problems.

The Hudl is manufactured by French company Archos.

It has 16GB of built-in memory - the same as the iPad mini and Google’s £80 more expensive Nexus 7 - and can access the internet and stream music and movies as well as on-demand TV services from Tesco-owned Blinkbox.

It has front and rear-facing cameras, allowing users to talk face to face via Skype, too.

The device also features a ‘Tesco launcher’ button to access online grocery shopping and the supermarket chain’s other businesses including clothing, banking and mobile phone services.

Aldi’s
Lifetab E7316, created with electronics firm Medion, may be cheaper but
it has just 8GB of storage – half that of Tesco’s tablet – and offers 
just four hours of battery life compared to 9.5 hours on the Hudl.

But it does come with a three year warranty.

Argos also tried to grab a share of the market, launching its £100 MyTablet in October.

It has now almost sold out.

Both the Lifetab and the Hudl will now also compete with Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD, on offer at £159, as well as the retail giant’s new 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX, which was reduced from £199 to £169 for Cyber Monday.

Apple’s second-generation iPad mini was launched last month, and costs £319, but has a slightly larger 7.9-inch screen.

Tablets have proved hugely popular since the launch of the iPad three years ago and some forecasters have predicted they will overtake sales of traditional computers by the end of this year.Three quarters of households still do not have one however.

Tony 
Baines, of Aldi, said: ‘We have positioned our Christmas offering this 
year to cater for every member of the immediate family with a fantastic 
gift at a manageable price, without compromising on quality.’

The
number of parents reading books to their children at bedtime is in 
rapid decline, according to a survey.

Some 70 per cent of 2,000 parents 
questioned now use tablets, computers or iPhone apps instead.

But
parents said technology was helping to revive the tradition, and more 
than half felt that it made bedtime reading more stimulating.
