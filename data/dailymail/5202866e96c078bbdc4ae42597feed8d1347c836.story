No footballer likes getting hit with the ball from close range but Zlatan Ibrahimovic went further than most to protect himself on Wednesday evening.

The Paris Saint-Germain striker was seen protecting his nose and groin area as he lined up in the French side's wall to defend an Ajax free-kick.

The 32-year-old may also have been trying to put the off Ajax's Lasse Schone but it didn't work as the midfielder curled the ball into far corner to make it 1-1.

It proved a frustrating night for Ibrahimovic - who was returning to the club where he first made his name - and PSG, who had earlier gone ahead through Edison Cavani but were unable to find a winner. 

Despite an underwhelming start, PSG will be hoping to improve on last year’s Champions League showing, when they were knocked out by Chelsea on away goals in the quarter-finals.

Joey Barton might suggest that Ibrahimovic's right hand would not be big enough to protect his nose.

In 2013, the then on-loan Marseille midfielder mocked the Sweden star for the size of his hooter, which was brave.
