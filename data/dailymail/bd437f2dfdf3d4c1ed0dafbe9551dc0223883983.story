Proud: James Yuen, with his father Samuel, has won one of only four scholarship places at Eton College

A 12-year-old maths prodigy who lives with his parents above their Chinese takeaway has won a Â£32,000-a-year scholarship to study at Eton.

James Yuen is one of only four state school pupils, out of hundreds who applied, to win a place at the prestigious school.

From September he will be swapping the flat above Hong Kong Takeaway in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, for an Eton dormitory.

James secured his place after achieving an A grade in GCSE maths at the age of 10, followed by an A at A-Level last year at Westcliff High School for Boys.

Famous Old Etonians include author George Orwell, actor and comedian Hugh Laurie, Princes William and Harry, and Prime Minister David Cameron.

Proud father Samuel Yuen, 39, said his success is to hard work and focus: 'He applied to take the exams, we encouraged him but didn't push him.

'I told him to go and to try his best, and that if he didn't make it, it didn't matter, because he already goes to a very good local school.

'Anyone could have applied, and there were lots of boys there at the open day. He will now have to knuckle down for the next five years in order to maintain his focus and good work.'

After attending an open day and sitting 
gruelling entrance exams James was granted a scholarship to the famous 
college in Windsor, Berkshire.

There are only four of the New Foundation scholarships available to boys who have been educated in state schools.

The intellectual standard expected by the college is described in its prospectus as 'very high' and 'fully on potential rather than knowledge'.

James attended an open day in early November, followed by round one of assessments. He was then shortlisted and invited to take part in the scholarship examinations, which take place over a three-day period and involved a two-night stay in a boarding house at the college. This was followed by a further interview.

James currently attends Westcliff High School for Boys, an academy grammar school that boasts exceptionally high exam results both at GCSE and A Level. He will finish this academic year at Westcliff before starting at Eton College in September.

Headteacher Michael Skelly said: 'James was very keen to pursue this, and he has been successful. Eton college is a very fine school, and I wish him all the best for the future.'

James Courtenay, the Tory councillor responsible for children and learning, said: 'I would like to offer my congratulations to James for his achievement, as it is an achievement for any child to be able to further their education at such a fine school as Eton.

'I would also like to extend my thanks to the staff at Westcliff High School for Boys for supporting James in his decision, and I wish him every success in his education.'
