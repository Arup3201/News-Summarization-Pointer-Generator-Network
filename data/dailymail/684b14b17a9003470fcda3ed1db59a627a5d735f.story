Robert F Kennedy Jr. is set to be quizzed over the exact nature of his relationship with his alleged mistress Chelsea Kirwan, MailOnline can reveal.

The Kennedy scion, who only married actress Cheryl Hines just weeks ago, will be dragged into the bitter divorce battle between Mrs Kirwan and her estranged husband, plastic surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan.

Dr Kirwan’s lawyers have informed Chelsea's legal team that they plan to depose both her and Mr Kennedy in a letter sent out this week.

The
62-year-old surgeon is currently trying to negotiate more time to see his three 
children with Chelsea and, as MailOnline has reported, was aware that 
she had enjoyed a close friendship with Bobby, as a source said: 
‘Laurence was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before
 their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’

Bobby, 60, allegedly had a two-year 'affair' with Chelsea, 42, which was reported earlier this year.

Soon
 after the news became public, a source said Bobby was set to be 
questioned under oath as part of the Kirwans' divorce case, saying: 
'Chelsea fears Laurence’s lawyers want to discredit her as a wife and a 
mom.

It is believed a 
friendship between Bobby and Chelsea started well before the Kirwans 
separated on July 4, 2012 - and a source told how Chelsea’s cell phone 
records showed she was speaking to Bobby five times a day in August 
2012.

The pair were also 
pictured together at an event in Seattle in April 2013, where Bobby 
feted mountaineer Jim Whittaker. And she is believed to have accompanied
 him around the country.

Dr Kirwan's lawyers want to ascertain whether the friendship started during the Kirwans marriage - and what the exact nature of the friendship was.

Under Connecticut law, where the divorce is being argued, any deposition would be made public.

Father-of-six Bobby married Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl, 49, on August
 2 at the Kennedy compound on Hyannis Port, Mass, in front of the Kennedy 
clan, including his mother Ethel Kennedy, and watched by a starry crowd 
including Cheryl’s former co-star and good friend Larry David and Julia 
Louis-Dreyfuss, while Natasha Bedingfield serenaded them.

His second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy - the mother of four of his children - killed herself in May 2012.

And
 asked about their relationship, Cheryl said: 'We share the same values.
 Family first. We like to have a good time and work hard. It’s fun to 
have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

The
 new Mr and Mrs Kennedy have since bought a $5m home in Malibu, 
California and Bobby now spends the majority of his time on the West 
Coast with his family.

He is believed to be spending two days a week in New York teaching at Pace Law School.

And a source close to the environmental lawyer said he would try and stay out of the Kirwans divorce, saying: 'I can't imagine Bobby will let himself be deposed. I think he'll find some way out.'

The 
Kirwans have had an acrimonious split. In August 2012, Dr Kirwan was 
charged with attacking Chelsea and his step daughter in an angry 
confrontation at their family home in Connecticut, a six-bedroom, $5.9 
million property complete with swimming pool.

'We share the same values': Cheryl Hines - pictured with Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2012 - spoke out about their upcoming marriage, saying: 'It's fun to have a partner. It's a good match up.'

But he later turned himself in to police, and was arrested and placed in custody.

He
 was charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against 
his alleged victims - Chelsea and her daughter Tailor, then 18, now 20.

Admitting to indiscretions,Dr Kirwan nonetheless said: ‘I have the greatest respect for my wife and I 
have tried hard to save my marriage. I still want to do everything 
possible to work it out.’

There
 are now new attorneys working on the divorce case following a mistrial 
and Dr Kirwan's lawyers have said they are available to depose both Chelsea and Bobby within the next few weeks.

In November, the 
charges will be dropped as he will have completed his two years 
probation, if he successfully adheres to the protection order and the 
guidelines set by the court.

When reached by MailOnline, Dr Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan Chapman declined to comment.

While a spokeswoman for Cheryl and Bobby also declined to comment when contacted.
