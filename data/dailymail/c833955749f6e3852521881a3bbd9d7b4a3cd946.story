Finding a hole in your sock is a distressing moment for anyone - and an American entrepreneur claims to have found an answer.

Cameron Carter, a 23 years old from Chicago who attended the US Air Force Academy, decided to take the military technology usually found in bulletproof vests, and put them into socks.

The resulting product is called 'Socrates', and are guaranteed to never develop holes or worn out bottoms.

The Socrates project is training money via Kickstarter - and has already almost tripled its target of $10,000

Carter has turned to online site Kickstarter to fund the project, and has already almost tripled his original aim, raising $28,000 dollars.

'Most people wear socks every day, all day, but continue to buy flimsy products, said Cameron on the firm's web site.

'Break the cycle! Your socks should be as sophisticated as you are.'

The sock is made primarily made from fabric with built in lycra.

The Kevlar sections are carbon 
threaded around the toe and heel areas where wear and tear is greatest.

The Socrates have kevlar fibres, usually found in bulletproof vests, sewn into the sole, toes and heel.

The firm is selling the socks online for $25 for two pairs, or $65 for three, and says they will be shipped five weeks after the Kickstarter funding closes later this month.

The product has already become a huge success, with over 700 people having signed up.

Once production has begun, the firm is also planning to expand with women's socks and different designs.

The Socrates appear to be normal such - the their inventor claims they will last forever.
