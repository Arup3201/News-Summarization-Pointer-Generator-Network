A British couple who survived a horrific machete attack at their Tobago holiday home are suing the Caribbean island's government £2 million for psychological damage.

Peter and Murium Green were left in a pool of blood after a man walked into the garden of their Tobago villain August 2009 and savagely hacked at them while they napped.

Retired hotelier Peter, 70, was left blind in one eye and suffered permanent brain damage while Murium, 65, was left with a huge permanent scar across her face.

The couple, from Wellington, Somerset, now say they deserve pay out of £1 million each for the lasting physical and psychological damage they suffered in the murderous assault.

They bought their home in Bacolet in the late 1990s and traveled over for two weeks in the sun before Peter began treatment for prostate cancer in August 2009.

A man burst into their property and left Peter with a cracked skull, fractured cheekbones, smashed teeth, limited vision after the knife cut out his left cornea, and nerve damage.

Murium, who has multiple sclerosis, had both cheekbones and eye sockets smashed, and her jaw detached. Medics said had she not regained consciousness and crawled to get help, the couple could have died.

Peter was put into a medically-induced coma after the attack, had to learn to walk again, and suffers from numbness down the left side of his body.

Recalling the horror, he said: 'When I was hit the pain in my head was something I could never parallel with anything else, and as I began to lose vision I had the fear of knowing I was dying.

'You hear about attacks there all the time and people need to know it's a dangerous place.

The couple think the government should have done more to warn tourists the resort was 'dangerous'

'The authorities don't like me because I am a constant reminder of what their republic stands for.

'They say I've ruined their tourism industry and had an effect on hoteliers, but people need to know how dangerous this place is.'

A 25-year-old local man was arrested but the case against him was dropped in April 2011 due to an apparent lack of evidence.

The couple also revealed that while in Tobago they had befriended a German couple called Brigid and Hubertus Keil who were discovered hacked to death in Bacolet Bay on Saturday – not far from the Green's home.

Mr Green said: 'The Keils were a delightful couple, we used to go for walks along the beach together and would occasionally go dancing together.

'Apparently someone crept up behind them and attacked them with a machete. When I heard what happened to suddenly made me relive what happened to us.

'When I was hit, the pain in my head was something I could never parallel with anything else, and as I began to lose vision I had the fear of knowing I was dying.

'When I heard what happened to the Keils I relived all that and knew the Keils must have gone through the same fear.' 

The couple's lawyers are preparing a legal challenge against the Trinidad and Tobago Government for £1 million compensation each, which will begin after they get the results of medical assessments.

They claim they have suffered ongoing physical and psychological damage and think the government should have done more to warn tourists the resort was 'dangerous'.

The couple have not returned to their villa since the attack and Peter believes the whole experience has cost his family more than £470,000.

He said: 'It might cost us a lot but we're going to do it. We want to bring it to people's attention that these islands are dangerous.

'There have been several other incidents. A Swedish couple were decapitated just west of Bacolet not long before we were attacked.

'It's a beautiful place but they do not tell you your life is in danger if you're going over there - it should carry some sort of health warning like on a cigarette packet.'
