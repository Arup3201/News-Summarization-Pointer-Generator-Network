Odds on: Vladimir Putin delivers a speech in Moscow on Friday. He is likely to sweep back into the Kremlin today with two-thirds of the vote

Moscow is on high alert for today’s 
presidential election, which is expected to see Vladimir Putin return to
 the Kremlin after a four-year absence.

Polls predict that Mr Putin will 
storm to victory – he is on course to gain 60 per cent of the vote – and
 the security services are preparing a major clampdown on protests.

Mr Putin’s nearest rival, veteran Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, is unlikely to secure more than 15 per cent of the vote.

Victory for Mr Putin, 59, will 
trigger a fresh round of opposition against what is seen as his 
authoritarian methods and new complaints over vote-rigging.

Demonstrators who poured on to the streets after December’s heavily disputed parliamentary elections are likely to return.

Security officials say police in 
Moscow are on ‘high alert’, with 34,500 officers in place today, and 
more than 6,000 reinforcements due into the city to cope with expected 
protests from tomorrow.

Special forces troops will also be on
 standby. Across the country, about 380,000 police will be on duty today
 alongside 60,000 private guards.

Russians were warned that officials will take tough action against any unauthorised mass protests around the Kremlin.

Blogger Alexei Navalny, the 
unofficial protest leader, called for a new round of peaceful action and
 said the people would never consider Mr Putin a president with 
legitimacy.

He told the Associated Press: 'People in Russia are not going to recognize Putin's victory in the first round.'

Another prominent protest figure, Ilya Ponomarev, a parliament member from the opposition A Just Russia party, said protesters' mood has become more truculent after authorities brushed off their demands for nullifying the results of the December parliament election.

'It has evolved from "we demand a rerun" to "go to hell",' he said.

Last December opposition rallies attracted vast crowds, upwards of 50,000 in Moscow. State television gave them substantial and mostly neutral coverage.

Mr Putin has repeatedly alleged that the protesters are stooges of the U.S. and Western European countries that want to undermine Russia.

He has also insulted them, saying for instance that their white ribbon emblems looked like condoms.

In the past week, the rhetoric became even harsher as Mr Putin publicly suggested the opposition was willing to kill one of its own figures in order to stoke outrage against him.

That claim came on the heels of state television reports that a plot by Chechen rebels to kill Mr Putin right after the election had been foiled.

Some of Mr Putin's election rivals dismissed the report as a campaign trick to boost support for him.

Despite official hostility to 
December's protests, they did force the government into some changes 
aimed at making the electoral process more transparent.

As
 the first protests roiled the country, Putin announced an expensive 
program to place two web cameras in each of the country's 90,000 polling
 stations, one showing a general view and one focusing on the ballot 
box.

However, foreign electoral observers have cast doubt on their effectiveness.

A
 report on Russia's electoral preparations by an election observation 
mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
noted: 'Cameras cannot capture all the details of the voting process, in
 particular during counting.'

Along with the OSCE mission, tens of thousands of Russians have volunteered to be election observers, receiving training on how to recognise vote-rigging and record and report violations.

In the December election, observers from the non-governmental group Golos reported being threatened and kicked out of polling stations.

Hostility to the group among officials remains. In January, the head of the Federal Security Service in the Komi republic called the group 'extremists' inspired from abroad.

Hugh Williamson of the international watchdog Human Rights Watch said in a statement: 'The Russian government has done the right thing by allowing unprecedented public protests and proposing some reforms.'

But, he added, despite the positive developments, the climate for civil society is as hostile as it ever was.'

In his past four years as prime minister - a sojourn he took because of a constitutional limit of two consecutive presidential terms - steely Mr Putin remained Russia's dominant political figure, overshadowing mild-mannered successor Dmitry Medvedev, who spoke often of reforms but accomplished little.

Mr Putin has promised to appoint Mr Medvedev prime minister if he wins the presidency in order to pursue his reform ideas, but many regard Mr Medvedev as lacking the hard-edge political skills to be an effective reformer.

In addition, appointing him premier could anger the opposition by echoing an earlier humiliation - the day in September when Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev told an obedient convention of the ruling United Russia party that Mr Medvedev would step aside from seeking a second term in order to allow Mr Putin to run.

The decision, done without public input and presented as a fait-accompli, was widely seen as cynical and anti-democratic - even an analyst close to the Kremlin called it a 'filthy deal' - and contributed strongly to the growing disillusion with Mr Putin.
