Two twin brothers were dramatically found safe today after going missing from a house on Corsica.

The disappearance on Friday of the three-year-old boys, Medhi and Yanis Boudjema, sparked a huge hunt in Levie on the French Mediterranean island, until they were both found separately.

Mehdi - who was staying with Yanis and his nanny - was the last of the two boys to be found safe today, by Chief Warrant Officer Bruno Mourier and his dog Hugo, and was reunited with his father.

Hunt: Around 100 police officers and firefighters, including trained mountain rescuers, were involved in the search, with air support from a helicopter. They are pictured outside the house from which the boys vanished

Yanis and Mehdi spent 30 and 36 hours alone respectively after vanishing on Friday at 7pm from Levie, a mountainous village around 24 miles from Porto-Vecchio in the Corse-du-Sud department.

The brown and blonde-haired boys were said to have been playing in a small cabin below the house.

A villager helped find the first child, Yanis, after hearing him crying in the silence of the mountains at around midnight on Sunday morning, before Mehdi was found by the dog at about 6:30am.

The children were found around 440 yards from each other, about 1.2 miles from the house at the bottom of a valley where they were staying, reported French news magazine L’Express.

A doctor found Mehdi to be in good health, before he was taken by helicopter to hospital in Ajaccio. It was said that the boys’ health would have entered a ‘danger zone’ had they been lost for 48 hours.

Yamina Boudjema, 35 - the mother of the twins, who lives in Porto-Vecchio - said: ‘They are doing very well. They were a little hungry and dehydrated, but they have since slept and ate.

'I have not yet asked for an explanation of what happened - it will come in time. Mehdi said simply: "Dog! Dog!"

‘I have not yet asked for an explanation of what happened - it will come in time. Mehdi said simply: “Dog! Dog!”. I want to thank from my heart all the help and the people of Levie and other villages. I kept hope through them - each had a kind word.’

Interior Minister Manuel Valls said he warmly welcomed the discovery of the boys and added that the ‘happy ending is a huge relief’.

Around 100 police officers and firefighters, including trained mountain rescuers, were involved in the search, with air support from a police helicopter.
