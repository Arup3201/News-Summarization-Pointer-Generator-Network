President Obama and his family have flipped the switch for the 90th annual lighting of the National Christmas Tree, marking the holiday season in the nation's capital.

Mr Obama was joined by his daughters, Sasha, 11, and Malia, 14, and wife Michelle. All were bundled to shield themselves from the cold December night.

Also helping in the festive ceremony was actor and singer Neil Patrick Harris, who hosted the tree-lighting ceremony.

Showman: As well as joining in with the singing, the President delivered a short speech in front of the dazzling tree in Washington

‘Merry Christmas, everybody!’ the 
president began. He was wearing a black wool overcoat and a maroon scarf
tucked loosely in his jacket. He was then interrupted by Harris, who 
said that it was wonderful to see Mr Obama’s daughters out and about.

‘It’s wonderful to see you, Mr President,’ the ‘How I Met Your Mother’ star added.

Mr Obama feigned confusion. ‘Is it time?’ he asked.

‘I
hope everybody’s ready,’ Mr Obama said. ‘We gotta do the countdown.’ 
The crowd then counted down from five, before the first lady and her 
daughters switched on the blue spruce's magnificent lights.

After the lighting, Harris continued to banter with the president, and joked with actor Rico Rodriguez of ABC's 'Modern Family' about joining the Obamas in Hawaii this Christmas.

The Fray, performed Christmas songs before a crowd of about 17,000 on 
the Ellipse, a park that sits between the White House and the National 
Mall.

The president said in a brief speech 
he has been inspired by Americans' response to Hurricane Sandy, which 
ravaged the Northeast in late October. He told a story of a street in 
Staten Island, where houses and businesses were devastated by the storm.

'A great big Christmas tree shines 
out of the darkness,' he said. 'A local nursery donated the tree, 
another business chipped in for lights and a star, and 70-year-old Tom 
Killeen and his friends planted it at the end of the street, overlooking
the town beach.'

'As Tom says, the tree has one message: `It's Christmas time, not disaster time,' the president concluded.

The National Christmas Tree ablaze 
with white lights and stars, Mr Obama joined the singers on stage in a 
singalong version of 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' before heading 
home, a short motorcade ride away.

This
year's giant blue spruce is new and was transplanted in October on the 
Ellipse, a park that lies between the White House and the National Mall.

The
previous tree died from transplant shock after just a year. Before 
that, a tree that stood for more than 30 years was destroyed by winds in
February. 2011.
