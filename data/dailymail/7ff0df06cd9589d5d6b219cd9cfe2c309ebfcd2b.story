She might have made headlines when a sprinkling of grey hairs were seen marring her glossy locks but that hasn't stopped the Duchess of Cambridge from being voted the UK's number one beauty icon for the third year in a row.

The 32-year-old royal saw off competition from TV favourite Holly Willoughby and Strictly Come Dancing champion Abbey Clancy to take the title, which was bestowed following a poll of 2000 British women.

Completing the top five were singer Beyonce and perennial favourite Cheryl Cole who remained popular despite adding an eye-catching tattoo to her posterior earlier this year.

Winner: The Duchess of Cambridge was named the UK's top beauty icon for the third year in a row

Runners up: Beyonce took third place while Holly Willoughby narrowly missed out on the top spot

The study placed Hollywood humanitarian icon Angelina Jolie as the sixth biggest beauty icon of the year, while X Factor
 judge Nicole Scherzinger was in seventh place, closely followed by 
Adele, who leapt from 14th to eighth place.

Fashion
 designer Victoria Beckham took ninth place, while Cara Delevigne, 
perhaps now more famous for her party girl antics than modelling career,
 completed the top ten.

Older women also proved popular, with 68-year-old Helen Mirren narrowly missing out on a top 10 ranking in 11th place.

Other more mature ladies to appear in the top 50 include Dame Judi Dench in at number 32 and Sharon Osbourne in 48th place.

Model
 Amy Willerton is a new entry in the top 50 beauty icons, at number 39 
following her appearance on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Perennial favourites: The ever popular Angelina Jolie and Cheryl Cole took fifth and sixth place

Celebrities Michelle Keegan, Alexa Chung, Alesha Dixon and Rihanna also appeared in the top 20, along with Michelle Obama and Mila Kunis.

The
 study also found just under half of all women polled are envious of the
 way celebrities look, and one quarter look to their favourites for 
inspiration on what to wear and how to look.

Forty-two per cent said seeing celebrities look amazing makes them take 
better care of their own appearance, while 18 per cent directly compare 
themselves to famous people.

Simon Comins of Superdrug, which conducted the annual Beauty Icons study of 2013, said: 'Kate Middleton has secured her place in the nation's hearts, and has cemented her position as a beauty Icon.

Over 50 and fabulous: Dame Judi Dench came 32nd while Helen Mirren narrowly missed out on the top 10

'The Duchess is always immaculately presented, but is styled in a way the average person can relate to, and take inspiration from.

'Our customers definitely take note of Kate's look, brunette hair colours and natural makeup have never been more popular, and it's interesting that the majority of our top ten list this year have naturally brown hair.'

He added: 'We spend a huge amount of time watching celebrity trends and beauty looks because we know our customers watch them too.

'But while today's women are inspired by beautiful women in the public eye, we're not seeing them slavishly copying specific looks - it's more about being encouraged to try something new after seeing it on a famous face.'
