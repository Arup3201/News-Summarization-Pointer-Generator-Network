Protesters in Ferguson continued their protests against the police last night, making a statement with a huge mirrored coffin.

Organizers in the Missouri town where black teenager Michael Brown was shot in August carried the symbolic item through the town.

The coffin, coated in mirror panes which were cracked in some places, is meant as a message to show that anybody could become a victim.

It also brought law the waiting line of police, wearing riot gear, face-to-face with their own reflections.

Those in charge of the 'Ferguson October' events are expecting 6,000 participants for the four-day event.

But the initial protest Friday outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton didn't draw nearly that amount.

Later Friday, tensions increased, with hundreds of people amassing outside the Ferguson Police Department and chanting anti-police slogans such as, 'Killer cops, KKK, how many kids did you kill today?' as a wall of about 100 officers in riot gear stood near them.

Some 300 people stood in the middle of the street screaming out: 'My hands on my head. Please don't shoot me dead' and 'Who shuts it down? We shut it down!' Roughly 30 regularly uniformed police officers stood guard outside the department.

Soon after, most of the crowd left, with organizers urging people to avoid arrest so that they could come back for more protests throughout the weekend.

Protesters renewed their call for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, an armed black teenager. 

A grand jury is reviewing the case, and the US Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death and a broader inquiry into the Ferguson police force.

'We are here to demand the justice that our people have died for,' chanted protest organizer Montague Simmons of the local group Organization for Black Struggle. 'We are here to bring peace, to bring restoration, to lift our banners in the name of those who've been sacrificed.'

In Clayton, officers escorted the several hundred demonstrators through the suburb's downtown as they marched past high-end restaurants, jewelry stores, banks and law offices in the rain, before the protests moved to Ferguson. 

After the Ferguson demonstration broke up, some protesters planned to go to the site of a police shooting in St. Louis.

Meanwhile, the St. Louis Police Department announced it had encrypted its radio communications system, saying tactical information relayed to officers had been compromised during recent events, putting officer and the public at risk.

Tensions remain high in the wake of another black 18-year-old's shooting death by a white police officer Wednesday night in St. Louis. Police say Vonderrit D. Myers shot at the St. Louis officer, who was in uniform but working off-duty for a private neighborhood security patrol. Myers' parents say he was unarmed.

The officer's name hasn't been released.

'It's important for this country to stand with this community,' said protester Ellen Davidson of New York City, who was making her second trip to the St. Louis area since Brown's death. 'This community is under siege. ... The eyes of the world are watching.' 

On Saturday, the protests shift to downtown St. Louis, hours before the Cardinals host the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series. And on Monday, a series of planned — but unannounced — acts of civil disobedience are to take place throughout the St. Louis region.

'I'm not planning to get arrested,' said Davidson, who was meeting up with other protesters from Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Tennessee. 'But I do plan to do what I believe are in my rights as a protester. If I get arrested, that's on the people who arrest me.'

Rain or shine: Bad weather did nothing to stop a protest against the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown

Protesters are calling for the arrest of Darren Wilson, the white Ferguson officer who killed Brown 

Officers escorted the several hundred demonstrators through the suburb's downtown as they marched past high-end restaurants, jewelry stores, banks and law offices 

Brown's parents, the local chapter of the NAACP and other organizations called for peaceful protests ahead of the 'Ferguson October' events. 

'We understand first-hand the powerless frustration felt by people of all walks of life regarding their interactions with law enforcement,' they said in a statement. 'We ask that those coming to show support for our son do so within the law.' 

St. Louis police arrested eight people Thursday as hundreds gathered to protest Myers' death. At one point officers used pepper spray to force protesters back. 

A police spokeswoman said one officer was struck in the arm after someone threw a brick, and several cars were damaged.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said authorities are planning for large crowds and possible violence. 

Black leaders in St. Louis want the Justice Department to investigate Myers' shooting as well. Police said the officer fired 17 rounds after Myers shot at him. Preliminary autopsy results show a shot to the head killed Myers. The officer wasn't injured.

Online court documents show Myers was free on bond when he was killed. He had been charged with the unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest in June.
