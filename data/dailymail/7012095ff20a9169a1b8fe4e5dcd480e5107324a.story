A Ukrainian man made bomb threats before trying to hijack a plane and divert it to Sochi, where the 2014 Winter Olympics are opening.

The man claimed there was an explosive aboard the Pegasus Airlines aircraft, a Boeing 737 which was travelling from Ukraine to Turkey.

He tried to force his way into the cockpit while armed with a device described as a detonator - but the pilot sounded the alarm and a military jet escorted the aircraft to an airport in Turkey.

The man, whom some reports say was extremely drunk at the time, was assured the plane was headed to Sochi, while in fact the aircraft, accompanied by a Turkish F-16 fighter jet, landed in Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport.

State television reported that the man has now been captured and taken away for questioning.

Unconfirmed reports have said that the man was drunk while making the threats. The Interfax news agency said sources in the Ukrainian Special Services described him as being severely drunk.

Earlier an official at the Sabiha Gokcen airport described how a translator was recruited to 'calm down' the suspect.

The source said: 'People are still inside but the pilot called security and gave them a signal that they can enter the plane. There is a translator - a Turkish man near the Ukrainian to calm him down'.

An official from the Turkish government confirmed that the plane from Kharkov, Ukraine, landed safely at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport.

Habib Soluk, the country's Transport Ministry undersecretary, had earlier given a television interview confirming the facts of the incident, and that officials were trying to convince the hijacker to turn himself in.

Mr Soluk said the man rose from his seat, shouted that there was bomb on board and tried to enter the locked cockpit. The pilot signaled that there was a hijack attempt and the airport was placed on high alert.

He said that the suspect was tricked into thinking the plane was headed to Sochi as it was taken to Turkey.

Mr Soluk said: 'The man was made to believe the plane was heading to Sochi. We are hoping that the passengers are evacuated without even a nose-bleed.'

Pegasus Airlines confirmed in a brief statement that there was a 'bomb threat' aboard their flight from Kharkov.

Russia had pledged that the Sochi games will be 'the safest Olympics in history' and has deployed around 100,000 police, security agents and soldiers in a massive security operation.

But fears of a terror attack, fuelled by recent suicide bombings in Russia, have left guests at Sochi concerned about potential threats.

Security experts have warned that Islamic militants in the Caucasus, who have threatened to derail the games, which run from today until February 23, could achieve their goal by choosing soft targets away from the Olympic sites.

The back-to-back December suicide bombings of a railway station and a bus in Volgograd, 400 miles east of Sochi, killed 34 people.

A jihadist group in Dagestan, part of the Russian Federation, claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings and has threatened to strike Sochi.
