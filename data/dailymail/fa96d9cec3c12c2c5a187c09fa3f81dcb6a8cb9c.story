Lord Sterling said there were a 'small amount of customers' trying to abuse the scheme

Rules surrounding a cars-for-disabled service are to be tightened after it emerged that high-end models could be being used by able-bodied friends and family of debilitated drivers.

State-funded charity Motability - which offers concessions on new cars for disabled motorists - says the number of people using the service has shot up from 200,000 to 575,000 also said it would no longer offer

The service, which costs £1.5billion a year, offers modified cars to those who qualify for government help with a disability.

However the Government is concerned that not enough checks are being made on those registered for the scheme and believe vehicles are being routinely passed on to claimants' friends and family.

As well as amending its qualifying rules, Motability also said it would no longer be offering top-of-the-range cars.

The move comes after allegations emerged that models such as BMWs and Mercedes were actually being used able-bodied drivers.

Lord Sterling, Motability chairman, said today that there were a 'small amount of customers who will try to abuse the scheme'.

He added that during Motability's last financial year, the charity had taken enforcement action in 2,139 cases, including 829 customers who had had their agreements terminated and their cars withdrawn.

The announcement will mean that the number of car models offered in the charity's price guide will be slashed by more than half.

Motability is tightening the rules over nominated drivers and pushing forward plans to increase its ability to investigate and act on allegations of abuse.

Lord Sterling said: 'With regards to how the car may be used and by whom, the principle of the scheme remains as it always has been - that cars must be used for the benefit of the disabled person.

'However, we have identified a need to refine our processes and communications around this principle, with clearer parameters so that customers can use the car appropriately and with confidence.

'In particular, we will now only accept nominated drivers who live within five miles of the customer in order to minimise the risk of the car being used other than for the benefit of the disabled person.'

The charity initially began by offering modified vehicles such as Mini Clubman Estate with wheelchair ramps, but it now has much more high-spec cars such as Audis and BMWs.
