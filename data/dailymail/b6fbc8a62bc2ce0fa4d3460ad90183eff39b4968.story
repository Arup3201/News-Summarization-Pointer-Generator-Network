A dog that was found in a frozen lake has been reunited with its owners after they saw news coverage of his Coast Guard rescue.

Owner Jodi Benchich said that her 14-year-old dog KC went missing 10 days ago and she had been searching for him.

'(I) found that the rope was broke and I just dropped everything and went searching,' Ms Benchich told WXYZ.

Happy together: Jodi Benchich was reunited with her 14-year-old dog KC after it was missing for 10 days

Tender loving care: The vet said that KC's frost bite and 30 pound weight loss can be fixed by Benchich

The dog covered a lot of territory, and the lake where he was found is about 30 miles away from his home in Romeo.

'I owe the Coast Guard guys a lot. It's amazing that they'll stop to even help an animal,' Ms Benchich said.

The veterinarian treating the dog said that it had not suffered any irreparable damage though it did have frostbite.

KC had also lost about 30 pounds during the ordeal, but that can be fixed with special meals and attentive care from his owners.

Handling with care: Two officers from a Coast Guard ice cutter came to the aid of this dog who was trapped in this ice on Lake St. Clair on the Michigan-Canada border on Monday

The Coast Guard's Bristol Bay ice 
cutter was headed to search for any other vessels that could have been 
trapped in the frozen ice when they spotted a group of foxes surrounding
 something in the distance.

As they made their way closer to the site, they realized that a dog had become trapped in the layers of ice and was near death.

'It was cold, weak and tired. It may have been out there for a couple of days or so,' Chief Petty Officer Alan Haraf told The Detroit Free Press.

'They noticed three burrows the dog tried to dig for itself for protection. They said the paws were bleeding and the nails were pretty much down to nothing.'

Three petty officers on board the ice cutter, called the Bristol Bay, packed on their cold weather gear and rescued the dog.

The dog, which the crew members nicknamed 'Lucky', was wearing a collar and harness but did not have a tag.

Making a stop: The boat was looking for stranded vessels when it spotted a group of foxes that had surrounded this dog

Once the dog was brought back on board using a stretcher, he was warmed up by the officers and fed some chicken breast.

The ice breaker headed back to Detroit from there and one of the officers took it to a local veterinarian.

It still remains unclear how the dog got out onto the ice and how he became stuck.
