This is a massive season for English clubs and England rugby — and with a few exceptions my interest in the Aviva Premiership is focused on how it impacts on Stuart Lancaster’s selections for the World Cup. It has to be that way.

It will be different and special this season and the scrutiny and debates will start the moment Northampton and Gloucester kick off on Friday night.

Now the dust has settled the truth is the three summer Test matches against New Zealand offered no answers to key questions being asked — and they all concern the backs.

Ready for the battle: The 12 captains gathered for the relaunch of the Aviva Premiership at Twickenham 

The England forwards are in very good shape — I would give my right arm to coach them — and the questions over the pack are all positive.

Can Geoff Parling get into a second row containing Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury? Could a fit-again Tom Croft be accommodated in the back row? Where would Steffon Armitage slot in, if he became available?

I have no serious issues with the pack and they will automatically make England competitive. There is depth, competition for places and their scope to improve over the next season, as a unit and individually, is very exciting.

But to win a World Cup we need to score tries and lots of them. England must be dynamic and pose huge problems in the backs.

Start: The Aviva Premiership has launched again for the 2014/15 season with Northampton reigning champions

RWC2015 will be exactly like the recent football World Cup. It will be the bold attack-minded teams with pace, vision and courage who prevail.

I’m convinced England have the players behind the scrum, but we have not yet got them on the pitch together and in the right positions — and some aren’t yet playing to their full potential.

So the Aviva Premiership this season, not least in this first tranche of games, before the England squad is announced for the November internationals, is going to be an important proving ground.

All the England guys must raise their standards this season. There will be a big step up this autumn and then another step again at the World Cup itself.

It will be fascinating to see if those who need to put their hands up can show us something special and whether they are given the licence to express themselves because the clubs’ primary concern is always winning league points. I hope so — there is a much bigger picture involved here.

Prospect: Watson has been widely tipped to feature for England next summer but has to perform for Bath

ANTHONY WATSON (Bath)

England wasted a golden chance to blood Watson against New Zealand this summer despite a cracking performance against Canterbury. So now he must make an unanswerable case with Bath on the fast early-season tracks and earn a start in the autumn.

He can play anywhere in the back three but England will see him as a wing. Where will Bath start him?

Powerhouse: Tuilagi is a regular starter for England with his strength and power but 'doesn't frighten the best'

 MANU TUILAGI (Leicester)

Has great strength and power, but that doesn’t frighten the best.

I want to see Manu spin passes out off both hands and put in a few chips. I want to see him looking for space, not contact. I know he can do it and it will transform his game. Manu could be the world-class inside centre England crave.

He is so much more than just a battering ram.

Starter: Farrell has established himself as England's No 10 as a world-class kicker and hard tackling

OWEN FARRELL (Saracens)

I like Farrell. He’s a world-class goal-kicker, tackles hard, has got attitude and can play centre as well.

He is in my squad every time, but do I see England winning a World Cup with Farrell starting at No 10? Not currently. I want to see more craft and devil in his kicking and passing, asking more questions of defences.

His bravery without the ball is indisputable, but how bold can he be with the gain line, how flat can he play?

Player to watch: Christian Wade has been troubled by injuries but is razor sharp when fit for London Wasps

CHRISTIAN WADE (Wasps)

Huge season for the Wasps wing after nine months out with injury. He’s got gas, wonderful feet and scores tries for fun and, being a glass half-full person, I love that.

OK, his defence might be suspect and he could be vulnerable under the high ball but this guy can terrify defenders. It is important that he quickly resumes normal try-scoring service for Wasps.

Challenger: Freddie Burns will hope for a big season with Leicester to challenge for a No 10 England shirt

FREDDIE BURNS (Leicester)

His game went stale while at Gloucester but the summer move to Leicester, and the confidence of playing in a team more used to winning, could re-energise him.

For me Burns falls between the physicality and goal-kicking excellence of Farrell and the creative skills of an X-Factor like Danny Cipriani — but he has the platform now at Tigers to take his game to another level.

Mercurial talent : Danny Cipriani (right) could yet make a late charge on Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad

DANNY CIPRIANI (Sale)

LIKE all the England No 10s could do with a fast start. Conducted himself very well throughout last season so that slate is surely wiped clean. Must be considered purely on merit now.

I keep asking myself one question: ‘Who would New Zealand least like to see playing fly-half for England?’ And my answer is a properly utilised, fully motivated, Cipriani.

Change: Sam Burgess of Rugby League'South Sydney Rabbitohs will switch codes and join Bath in October

SAM BURGESS (Bath)

I’ve been hitting YouTube and am impressed by what Burgess could potentially offer at inside centre.

Bath have said that is where they will play him initially, which is good, but I would fast-track him into the England squad anyway.

I would also give him game time in the autumn internationals. We need to know sooner rather than later.

DAVID HUMPHREYS (Director of rugby at Gloucester)

I Know David well from London Irish days. He is a top-quality individual and one of the best young directors of rugby about. Gloucester should be one of the giants of the English club game, but the job has thwarted some of the best rugby brains around.

Which is, I suspect, exactly why David has accepted the challenge. It will be tough but watch this space.

All Black: Piri Weepu, a World Cup winner with All Black pedigree, will be the key for London Welsh

PIRI WEEPU (London Welsh)

Weepu is not a ‘great’ All Black in the manner of a Richie McCaw or Dan Carter but he is a very good All Black — a World Cup winner — and you can gauge the whole-hearted character of the man by his opting for a team who will surely be battling to avoid the drop.

There has been a huge influx of new players at Welsh and he has a big role to play in setting the standards.

BRAD THORN (Leicester)

Tigers fans will absolutely love this World Cup winner, and vice versa. A big tough mean Kiwi second row who wins trophies wherever he plays. Opponents absolutely hate playing against him.

He’s 39 years old now, but when you have never relied on speed anyway, what does that matter?

Do Leicester start games with Thorn or bring him on after 50 minutes? I’d start him.
