Jane Fonda has revealed that she lied about losing her virginity to friends at school because she 'wanted to fit in.'

The 76-year-old New Yorker opened up about the difficulty of coming to terms with her sexuality as a teenager on the Today show this morning, but declined to divulge the exact age she first had sex.

Growing pains: Jane Fonda revealed that she lied about losing her virginity to friends at school because she 'wanted to fit in' on the Today show this morning

'One of the things I say in the book is 
often [young people] hear from their peers that everybody is "doing it". Not true,' she told Today host, Matt Lauer.

'In fact more adolescents are not engaged in sexual activity. I [lied about losing my virginity] because I wanted to fit in.'

In her new book, Ms Fonda 'straight talks' about a range of topics from sexting to eating disorders.

With three children of her own - two 
biological and one adopted - and two grandchildren she said she has 
great insight into the problems many young people encounter.

'Today it's even more difficult for kids because of the media,
 cyber bullying, sexting,' she continued.

'No is a complete sentence.
 Kids need to learn to say no.

'Boys and girls have right to have agency
 over their bodies.

'We're such a strange nation. We're very puritanical
 on one level and then yet there's a lot of sexuality in the media. You're supposed to look sexy and be the good girl.'

All smiles: The thrice-married blonde is currently in a solid relationship with music producer Richard Perry -  five years her junior - and says she is happier than ever

Ms Fonda has been very open about her sex life in recent years, claiming that it helps keep her young and in shape.

However,
 decades ago it was something that she did 'without feeling' as she was forced
 to participate in a range of sexual acts, including threesomes, by her former husband 
Roger Vadim.

The thrice-married blonde is now in a solid relationship with music producer Richard Perry -  five years her junior - and says she is happier than ever.

Revealing the secrets to a healthy relationship she said on Today: 'You have
 to be able to trust the person you're with.

You should be able to feel you could tell him or her private things without them being used against you.'

She added that the one thing she now values in people is 'kindness' - a quality she overlooked in her younger years.

Asked if she thinks about mortality as she nears 'the big 8-0', Ms Fonda merely replied: 'All the time.'

'I think it's really important to realize we're not going to live forever. I'm not scared of dying,' she added.
