There was chaos on the streets of downtown Hong Kong today as hundreds of masked men attacked barricades erected by pro-democracy demonstrators.

The counter-demonstrators pulled at the metal fencing stretching across the roads of central Hong Kong, shouted abuse and picked fights with Occupy protesters.

The latest attack on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement came as the the semi-autonomous Chinese city's Beijing-backed leader proclaimed they have 'almost zero' chance of meeting their objectives.

CY Leung, chief executive of the former British colony, dismissed the protesters' efforts in an interview with a local television station. 

'I believe we all know that the chance is almost zero,' he said of demonstrators' goal of forcing China to allow a free vote in the territory's next election. 

Responding to calls for his resignation, Mr Leung said last night that his leaving office would not 'solve the problem' and denounced protest leaders for allowing demonstrations to 'spin out of control'. 

Today several hundred people - mostly men of middle age or older - crowded in front of the Occupy Central barricades chanting 'Open the road!'

Some tried to pull down the metal barricades that protesters have set up to block off main roads near the heart of the city's financial district.

They also shouted, 'Occupy Central is illegal,' referring to one of the names of the pro-democracy movement that has swept Hong Kong.

Taxi drivers also joined in, with some driving their cabs up to the barricades and leaning on their horns to express their anger about the traffic disruptions.

They were held back by a line of police officers.

The protesters faced them from the other side of the barricades. Police took away some masked men inside the protest zone who tried to pick fights with the protesters.

Alex Kwok, an Occupy protester, said he received a scratch on his arm after he was attacked by several men whom he accused of being members of triads, or organised crime gangs. 

Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017.

Beijing said a 1,200-member committee stacked with pro-government elites should nominate two or three leadership candidates before the public votes.

Protesters say this gives them no real choice and do not amount to genuine democracy. 

The protests are the worst in Hong Kong since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. They pose one of the biggest political challenges for Beijing since it violently crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. 

When China took control of Hong Kong, it agreed to a policy of 'one country, two systems' which allowed it a high degree of control over its own affairs and kept in place liberties unseen on the mainland.

It also promised that the city's leader would eventually be chosen through universal suffrage, and Hong Kong residents have long felt their island stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems.

At one point tens of thousands of protesters occupied busy roads outside the city government headquarters as well as in two busy shopping districts, but their numbers have since dwindled.

You are free to do what we tell you: Jackie Chan has criticised the HK protests 

Much-loved kung fu film star Jackie Chan has further cemented his new position as an apparent Chinese communist party stooge with criticism of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests.

The star of such classics as Drunken Master and Police Story posted a message on micro-blogging site Weibo saying he was 'worried' by the demonstrations and calling on protesters to 'return to rationality'.

His comments more or less parroted the official rhetoric regarding the demonstrations handed down from officials in Beijing and Hong Kong.

According to an English translation by the website Shanghaiist, Chan, now 60, wrote: 'I found out through the news that Hong Kong’s economic losses reached HK$350 billion [$45 billion] and I’m really worried...

'I believe every Hong Kong resident loves Hong Kong and wishes it well! Hong Kong’s bright tomorrow requires everyone’s support and hard work...

'In the song "Country," one line goes: "There is no prosperous home without a strong country." I am willing to work hard with everyone and return to rationality, to face the future, love our country, love our Hong Kong.'

It is not the first time that Chan, a Hong Kong native, has spoken out against public protests - a key democratic freedom. 

In 2012 he complained 'Hong Kong protests about everything', and even went so far as to suggest there should be rules about what people can protest about.

Jackie Chan's son Jaycee Chan is currently in trouble with the law in China after he was arrested for allowing others to take drugs at his Beijing home.

Jaycee, 32, was in August held alongside Taiwan-based movie star Kai Ko after police found them with nearly four ounces of cannabis at Chan's property in the Chinese capital's Dongcheng district.
