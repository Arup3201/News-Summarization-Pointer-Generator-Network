A family were left baffled after discovering a strange ‘sea monster’ washed up on a British beach.

Lisa Worthington, 42, chanced upon the creature while out walking the family dog with husband, Peter, 52, and their two children.

The two-foot long skeletal remains were found on the high tide mark on the beach in Weston-Super-Mare, north Somerset.

Mysterious: The two-foot skeletal remains of a sea creature were found on Weston-Super-Mare beach

The family decided to take the mysterious skeleton home so that her 10-year-old son Tyler could show his friends.

Lisa, a stay-at-home mother, from Uphill, near Bristol, said: 'It was really quite strange. We were just walking the dogs when we stumbled across it. It was very strange.

'People have come up with some crazy ideas as to what it could be. My friend even thought it could be a llama, as the long tail-y bit looks like a neck.

Odd: The remains baffled one marine biologist, who declared that he'd never seen anything like it before

'I guess with it being washed up on the beach you would expect it to be a fish or something, but it doesn't look very fishy.

'My son was fascinated by it. I've definitely not seen anything like it before. He wanted to take it to school for show and tell.

'He carried it home in a big carrier bag. It absolutely stinks now though. I’ve told him he’s going to have to get rid of it.'

The family posted an image of the skeleton on Facebook where speculation grew about what the creature could be.

Mystery solved? One marine biologist believe the skeleton could be that of a thornback ray (pictured)

Some suggested the animal was a lizard or swan whilst others claimed it was some kind of large fish or stingray.

Marine biologist, Steve Simpson, said: 'This is certainly nothing I have seen before.'

Other deep sea creature experts said that it was likely the skeleton was that of a thornback ray.

Shelby Temple, a professor at Bristol University, said: 'I think that is the remains of a thornback ray (Raja clavata).

'They are fairly common on muddy/sandy substrates around the UK and Europe.

'The photos certainly make it look like a weird deep sea creature. You wouldn't want to inadvertently step on that tail!'

The discovery followed a rare bluefin tuna worth close to £1million being brought ashore by five university friends in Cornwall.

Strict EU laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in Japan for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them.

So Sarah Little, 22, Laura Pickervance and Shauna Creamer, both 23, and Charlotte Chambers and Hannah Ford, both 24, will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in Cornwall.

The 7ft 1in specimen, which was perfectly edible, has been sitting in a fisherman’s freezer prior to being taken to the University of Exeter on Sunday where it will be dissected and studied by experts, rather than served up in a restaurant.
