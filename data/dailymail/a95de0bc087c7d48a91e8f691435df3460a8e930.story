At first sight, this could be one of the hooded, black-clad terrorists involved in the Paris shootings.

In reality, it is a male model on a London catwalk yesterday, promoting military-influenced ‘utility-chic’ designer wear.

With highly dubious timing, fashion label Maharishi continued with its show as world leaders prepared to join a million-strong march in Paris today to remember those killed in the outrage.

One model wears a black jacket with a hood that resembles a balaclava, with the mouth covered and just the eyes exposed and carries an ominous-looking umbrella on his back. 

Former Home Office Minister Norman Baker said: ‘The timing of this does look a little unfortunate.’ 

The designer, which was established in 1994 by Hardy Blechman, has been specialising in military fashion since its outset.

It made a comeback on the runway for today's show where the autumn/winter 2015 collection featured nineties trademark camo print and combat trousers.  

Blechman previously worked in the international military and industrial clothing surplus trade and began producing hemp and other natural fibre clothing as well as recycling workwear.

It comes as millions of people prepare to march in Paris today to remember those who were killed in the Charlie Hebdo massacre and hostages at the Jewish kosher supermarket.

A total of 12 people were killed at the satirical magazines offices on Wednesday, including cartoonists and two police officers, as well as four people held hostage on Friday.
