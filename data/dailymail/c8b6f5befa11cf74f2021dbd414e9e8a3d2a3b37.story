The sight of Jonathan Trott and 
Alastair Cook getting out  to loose, almost reckless shots when survival
 was the height of ambition said everything about the sorry state 
England found themselves in at the end of a Test series they should have
 dominated.

England’s most prolific and 
single-minded batsmen are usually  perfect for a crisis. But their  
departures on the fourth evening of this final, decisive Test in the 
face of a mountainous target looked to have made this a case of one  
survival battle too many.

England went into the final day at 
Eden Park perilously placed at 90 for four. They were chasing a  nominal
 481 for victory but needing a rescue act beyond even those that saw 
them draw Tests against the odds in recent times at Centurion, Cape 
Town, Cardiff and, in this series, Dunedin.

Batting coach Graham Gooch, who has pretty much seen it all, admitted that England may have underestimated New Zealand.

‘I think it’s a great reality check 
that you can’t take any team lightly and can’t play people on what it 
says in the rankings, or on a piece of paper,’ said Gooch after the 
fourth day. ‘You have to play good cricket to compete and in two of the 
three matches so far, New Zealand have been in the ascendancy.

‘Our performance has not been up to 
the standards we’ve produced on a consistent basis so we’ll have to look
 at that, yes. But I wouldn’t say we took them lightly after the  first 
match, when New Zealand  dominated the game. They’ve  outbowled and 
outbatted us so far.’

What makes this so hard to take is 
that New Zealand, the world’s eighth-ranked team, lost seven of their 
eight Tests prior to this series and endured an internal crisis over 
Ross Taylor’s removal as captain which was every bit as damaging as the 
Kevin Pietersen affair.

Yet they went into the final day as 
hot favourites to wrap up only their fourth Test series triumph over 
England and their first against  anybody other than Zimbabwe and 
Bangladesh since 2006, when they defeated West Indies.

The first session of day four summed 
up this Test and the whole sorry series for England. They were dreadful.
 They lacked ideas, imagination and, frankly, leadership as New Zealand 
moved into a position from which history tells you they could not 
possibly lose this Test.

So bad were England before lunch that 
New Zealand, who began the day at 35 for three and under a smidgen of 
pressure, were able to score freely and aggressively to rack up 141 in 
the session for the loss of Dean Brownlie. It was witless, hopeless 
cricket from England, notable for the petulance of Stuart Broad in 
berating his fielders and the apparent lack of anything resembling 
tactical nous.

Double up: Fulton is applauded off on the day he completed his second century of the Test match

The biggest recipient of England’s 
largesse was Peter Fulton, a  cricketing journeyman who was expected to 
be little more than a walking wicket in this series after a four-year 
absence from the five-day game. Instead, he became only the fourth New 
Zealander, after Glenn Turner, Geoff Howarth and Andrew Jones, to score 
two centuries in the same Test.

New Zealand started the fourth day 
with a lead of 274 but by  the time Fulton and Brendon  McCullum, with 
yet another half-century, had completed their stand of 117 in only 16.5 
overs, the Test was out of England’s reach barring a recovery of 
historic proportions.

Monty Panesar, who had started the day
 by taking Brownlie’s wicket thanks to an excellent catch from Ian Bell 
and bowled four maidens on the trot, was then destroyed to the tune of 
52 runs in his next five overs.

Fulton, vulnerable outside  off stump,
 was allowed to indulge his love of the leg side, seemingly dispatching 
Panesar over the short, straight boundary at will. It was when Fulton 
brought up his hundred with another straight six, off Broad, that the 
game was up.

McCullum, a combative, purposeful 
cricketer who has vindicated his controversial elevation above Taylor by
 out-captaining Cook, delayed his declaration possibly longer than 
necessary and set England 481 to win.

It was quickly made worse when Nick 
Compton, who came into this match with successive centuries, fell 
cheaply for the second time in the match. And it could have been made 
terminal had Cook not been dropped by diving wicketkeeper BJ Watling on 
one.

It looked likely to be costly but when
 Jonathan Trott was out, uncharacteristically driving at a wide one from
 Neil Wagner, and Cook — showing unnecessary attacking intent — was 
snaffled by a smart Brownlie catch, England were in big trouble.

The departure of the Watford Wall, 
nightwatchman Steven Finn, to what became the final ball of the day 
completed England’s misery. It is time for some soul-searching before 
the return series in England in May and then 10 back-to-back Ashes 
Tests.

‘It’s not the sort of conclusion to 
the winter we wanted,’ admitted Gooch. ‘We wanted to finish strongly 
going into a big summer and build on the Test cricket we played in 
India.

‘We’ve had some good performances but 
here we’ve not found that form so we’ve got to be disappointed. We can’t
 be happy with the way we’ve played.’

HOW KIWI ATTACK WON TEST BATTLE

England came into this series with a much-envied bowling unit. But while Jimmy Anderson and Co have been off the pace, the New Zealand underdogs have shown plenty of bite. All four of England’s main bowlers have underperformed, as the statistics show, while their Kiwi opponents, with the exception of Tim Southee, have all improved their career statistics.
