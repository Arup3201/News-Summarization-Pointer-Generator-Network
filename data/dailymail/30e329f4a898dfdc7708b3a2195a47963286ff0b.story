An Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Expert has been stood down over alleged offensive slurs on his Facebook page, including one referring to Federal treasurer Joe Hockey.

 ACCI chief economist Burcell Wilson is being investigated over claims he posted a number of wildly inappropriate comments against the disabled, the refugees, Muslims and Mr Hockey describing him as a 'fat b*****d' whose biography was tedious.

The claims have been denied by Mr Wilson who believes someone is after him over political reasons.

The Australian reported that a complaint had been lodged with the ACCI via an email containing screen grabs that the complainant alleged were from Mr Wilson’s Facebook account.

After finding out about the alleged distasteful slurs, CEO Kate Carnell took action immediately. 

ACCI CEO Kate Carnell has stood down fellow colleague Burcell Wilson over offensive facebook posts saying an investigation will take place\

'Today I have been made aware of a number of offensive, derogatory and completely unacceptable Facebook posts allegedly made by ACCI Chief Economist Burchell Wilson.' she wrote in a statement.

'After learning of the matter, I spoke to Mr Wilson and directed him to stand-down from his position pending a thorough investigation.'

'This is a matter we are taking very seriously.' Ms Carnell said.

'ACCI also takes issues of natural justice seriously, and are providing Mr Wilson with an opportunity to respond to the allegations before any further action is taken.'

'I will make no further public comment on this matter at this time.' she said.

In screen shots of the status updates sent to The Australian, the emails included a post claiming moderate Islamic leaders were providing a smokescreen for Muslims who were 'putting bombs on your buses and raping your children'.

More alleged screen grabs posted saying 'the c*** sitting next to me at the bench is bitching to his deformed girlfriend about 'once you are recognised as a refugee.....'. Shut the f**k up or I will make you one'. 

An alleged attack by Mr Wilson on rival business group BCA (Business Council of Australia) and its CEO Jennifer Westacott were also mentioned. 

But The Australian has also reported that Mr Wilson claimed he was the victim of hacking.

 'I’ve spoken to the ACT Police today as I have genuine concerns for my safety from this complainant,' he said.

'I’m disappointed my CEO didn’t consider my personal safety or the safety of her staff before standing me down.'

'This lunatic is coming after me purely for political reasons.' he said.

In a biography posted on the ACCI website, it states Burchell Wilson has been ACCI's Senior Economist since early 2009.

He produces regular Economic Policy Bulletins on major economic data releases and announcements by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
