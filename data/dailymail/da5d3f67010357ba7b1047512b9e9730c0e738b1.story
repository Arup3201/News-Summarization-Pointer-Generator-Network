When the set of photos apparently showing a naked Prince Harry cavorting in his hotel suite surfaced last night, the initial reaction for many was one of disbelief.

Firstly, we thought, wasn't it unlikely that a member of the Royal Family should strip naked in front of camera-wielding strangers? Even if that member of the Royal Family is the notorious good-time guy, Harry?

Secondly, we couldn't help but recall those 'stolen' photos taken by photographer Alison Jackson, famous for mocking up unseemly situations using Royal lookalikes.

In naked photographs of Prince Harry that surfaced yesterday the young royal wore a distinctive silver pendant that he had worn on numerous occasions before - and is said to have been a love token from Chelsy Davy

Indeed, following the Royal wedding, Jackson staged some fake photographs of a cheeky Prince Harry pinching the bottom of a very realistic Pippa Middleton lookalike. Could these be some well-timed works from Jackson?

But on closer examination, we realised - thanks to a very distinctive piece of jewellery - that we were indeed looking at photographs of the third in line to the throne in the altogether.

The jewellery in question is a silver pendant with a small amber-coloured stone in the middle, and it was reportedly given to the young royal by his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in the early days of their five year relationship.

Harry has been wearing the necklace on and off ever since - the leather thong is frequently seen peeping above the neckline of his shirt - but according to recent reports, the fact that he has returned to wearing it religiously shows the depth of his affection for Chelsy.

For her part, Chelsy is said to reciprocate by wearing a blue topaz ring that was a gift from Harry.

Love
token: Chelsy Davy, pictured here with Prince Harry in 2007, is said to
have given Prince Harry the necklace when they first started dating

Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas?

Quite what Chelsy would have made of the circumstances in which the love token (if it is indeed such a thing) found itself is another matter - but given the length of time that the relationship has lasted, one can assume she is fairly accepting of his carousing ways.

The 27-year-old prince's on-off relationship with Chelsy, 26, has spanned seven years in total, and the two are still close.

Chelsy joined Prince Harry as recently as 2 May for Princess Eugenie's birthday party at Windsor Castle, and it was reported at the time that the two were in the process of rekindling their romance.

The couple split when Chelsy decided that following a Royal lifestyle was not for her - but with Harry wearing the love token so publicly, could yet another rekindled romance be on the cards?

Watch this space.

THIS NECKLACE HAS HISTORY...

The leather thong of the necklace can be seen at the neckline of his shirt - but the precious pendant was tucked away inside for the majority of Harry's Brazil tour

Prince Harry wore the necklace at the end of last year on a night out at the Arts Club in London's Mayfair

... and again, just glimpsed, on a night out with friends at Mahiki nightclub in London
