The owners of a run-down Disney-esque theme park  are hoping for a fairytale ending in their search for a passionate buyer willing to part with $560,000 to restore the tourist attraction to it's former glory.

Shane and Karen Hay put the iconic Fantasy Glades theme park, in Port Macquarie, NSW, on the market after six years of trying to restore and modernise the amusement park for a new generation.

Fantasy Glades, set in two hectares of bushland, was home to Snow White's cottage, Cinderella's castle (complete with drawbridge), and a dragon cave, and ran for 35 years before shutting in 2002.

Theme park Fantasy Glades in Port Macquarie, NSW, is up for sale for $560,000 

Fantasy Glades was built by a family of little people- George and Rosemary Whitaker and their children

The theme park was created by George and Rosemary Whitaker, who had dwarfism, along with their children and Rosemary's parents, and opened in 1968 out of a desire to build their own fairy tale.

After changing hands several times, the Hay's bought the property at 44 Parklands Close, Port Macquarie, in 2009 as a 'semi-retirement plan' after falling in love with the theme park.

'We wanted to bring it back to life, and it was a matter of bringing it into the new age to make it digital and more modern,' Shane Hay told Daily Mail Australia.

'My father was a builder and he was going to help us but he passed away and unfortunately we have to move on,' he said.

Fantasy Glades has deteriorated over the years, vandalised by graffiti and attacked by natural elements, and is now a shadow of the park it used to be.

The castle, which is owner Karen Hay's favourite attraction, has deteriorated since the park closed in 2002

Many of the windows have been broken by rocks, and rotted wood and faded paint now feature heavily around the theme park. 

In the theme park's heyday, thousands of excited families streamed into the tourist attraction to spend time in fairy tales brought to life.

Mr Hay said that he and his wife both have fond memories of Fantasy Glades, and his wife's favourite attraction  was the chapel and Cinderella's castle. 

'How would you like to live in and enjoy this idyllic situation, there is more than enough room to build the home of your dreams and take advantage of the unique ambiance that this property has to offer,' says the ad on Gumtree.

The mini-chapel featured tiny pews and was inscribed with Rosemary's favourite bible verse, Psalm 23

The Hays wanted to modernise the attractions at Fantasy Glades for a new generation

Popular attractions included Snow White's cottage- complete with dwarves and beds-, the Old Lady who lived in a Shoe, the Crooked House, a monorail, Humpty Dumpty, Little Red Riding Hood's Grandmother's House, and many others. 

'My wife always wanted to do it up, and we'd like to see it sold to someone who will preserve the heritage,' he said.

The couple had made plans to import modern dinosaur figures, to add to the original figurines, which have now been sold and are being kept in storage. 

While Mr Hay said that the couple are realistic about needing to sell, and cannot hold onto the property forever, they would ideally like the potential buyer to be passionate about the site and interested in restoring it.

Snow White's cottage featured dwarves and beds for the characters to sleep in 

Snow White's Diamond Mine was a walk-through mine with a series of animated show-scenes

Snow White's cottage was a miniature replica of the house where Snow White and the Seven Dwarves

'We've had a fair amount of interest, and some from local groups who would like to use it as a community site for gardens and sculptures,' he said.

The ad on Gumtree has had 28,000 hits, and close to 5,500 people have joined the Facebook page in support of keeping Fantasy Glades open. 

'Port Macquarie really needs something like this. I'm sure there's someone out there, someone younger than us,' said Mr Hay. 

The theme park is up for both cash and trade, with the ad indicating that up to $210,000 in trade will be accepted.

While the Hay's hope that someday their prince will come- and that he'll bring along $500,000 with him- the property is still on the market, offering some lucky potential buyer a modern fairy tale in the making.

The theme park operated for 35 years before being closed in 2002

Mr Hay said that he hopes the new buyer will respect the theme park's heritage and restore it's glory
