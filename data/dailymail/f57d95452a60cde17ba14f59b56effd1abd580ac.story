Peter Foster can no longer eat through this mouth and relies on a tube for all his bodily needs.

Before that he couldn't taste or smell.

The 20-year-old suffers from glaucoma - which has blinded his left eye and enabled only minor vision in his right - and his lung capacity is down to 35 percent.

Peter also has micropthalmia, a congenital eye abnormality resulting in small eyeballs.

But, despite having over 25 diagnoses and undergoing between 40 and 60 procedures in his short life, Foster remains incredibly optimistic.

Inspiration: Ben Foster, 21, has developed quite a following line, thanks to his YouTube videos that document his many medical issues. He recently had to have a feeding tube inserted in his stomach

Ongoing issues: Peter has been plagued with sickness his whole life, and now relies on a tube (right) for all food and drink, unable to eat with his mouth. But he consistently remains optimistic in his online diaries 

Peter's personal motto is simple.

'No matter what, it could always get worse,' he says.

Peter has operated a YouTube account since 2011, documenting his medical issues.

This week he posted his fist video in two, updating his channel's 16,150 subscribers.

'Over the last couple years, my health has deteriorated, but I'm still loving life,' he said.

'I now have an eating tube in my stomach. I eat totally via tube.'

'I get weak and I get tired very easily.'

'But I hope that you guys will watch my videos if I decide to start uploading again.'

'I just want to say to thank you to anyone who still watches my channel. God bless you.' 

The video is quickly gaining traction online, especially on Reddit, where Peter appears to have a decent amount of followers.

According to The Daily Dot, one such follower posted this message of support: 'Understanding the struggles of others can help put our own lives in perspective and teach us to be more appreciative of what we have.'
