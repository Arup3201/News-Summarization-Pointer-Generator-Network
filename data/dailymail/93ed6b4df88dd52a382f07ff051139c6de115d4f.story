Police have been hunting down boozy drivers

The number of drink drivers caught behind the wheel by police has soared in the last two years - with officers catching one boozy motorist who was just 14.

The youth was among almost a dozen underage drivers suspected of drinking and driving over the past two years, along with eight 16-year-olds and two teens aged 15.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed the 14-year-old boy was stopped in 2010 by West Midlands Police.

Meanwhile the oldest driver who faced prosecution for being under the influence of alcohol was 85.

The force charged 3,094 people with drink-driving last year - 409 more than the 2010 figure of 2,685.

The figures emerged after the force recorded a 19 per cent jump in the number of people failing breath tests during a month-long summer crackdown.

Inspector Greg Jennings, who led the campaign, said: 'Drivers are putting themselves at risk of losing their licence, large fines and imprisonment as well as the guilt and shame of ruining the lives of others.

'The only safe level of alcohol to drive with is zero.

'Drinking any alcohol consumption will impair your ability to drive.'

Police say there has been a worrying rise in the amount of underage drink drivers who are getting behind the wheel when they have had too much to drink (posed by models)

Road safety campaigners said they were 'deeply concerned' at the rise in young drink drivers.

Alice Granville, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'It’s deeply concerning that there have been a number of recent drink-drive incidents involving minors in the West Midlands.

'Underage offenders need to be educated on the effects of drink driving and the dangers of being reckless behind the wheel.'

Britain’s youngest drink driver was caught in 2005 in Thatcham, Berkshire, when police pulled over a swerving Vauxhall Corsa on Christmas day to find a 12-year-old girl at the wheel.

Earlier this week it was revealed that businessman Arthur Kibble was selling controversial pills which claimed to help drivers beat police breath tests.

He was condemned for marketing what safety campaigners called the 'dangerous and stupid' Alcopal tablets.
