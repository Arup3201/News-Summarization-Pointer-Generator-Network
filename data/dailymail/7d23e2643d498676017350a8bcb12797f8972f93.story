This is the amazing moment firefighters brought a cat back from the brink of death using tiny, pet-sized rescue equipment.

A rescue team plucked the pet - named Soldier - from a blazing building in Columbia, South Carolina, and found that he was lifeless and unresponsive.

But the undaunted firefighters performed CPR on the cat, while giving him oxygen through a specially-designed mask meant for rescuing pets.

Back from the brink: Firefighters used a pet-sized oxygen mask to revive Soldier the cat, whom they plucked from a burning building in Columbia, South Carolina

Alive: After several minutes of CPR, and help from the oxygen mask, soldier came to and was able to take a drink from the firemen who had saved his life

After several minutes, Soldier started breathing normally again, and was able to get up and walk over to another firefighter who gave him a drink after the rescue last Wednesday.

The tiny oxygen mask - developed by a firm called Wag'N O2 Fur Life - was bought for the Columbia fire service using donations from the public, local TV station WLTX reported.

According to the company, pets usually respond to house fires by finding a hiding place rather than fleeing, making them much more vulnerable to smoke.

Tim Gorman, Soldier's owner, told the TV station: 'They nicknamed him Smoky because they didn't know what the cat's name was - he was unresponsive, but they were able to revive him by performing chest compressions.'

'I appreciate everything you've done, everything you guys do.'

A fire service spokesman said: 'Columbia Fire Department takes it serious [sic] when we save any life, whether that’s two-legged or four-legged.'
