Adult entertainment website PornHub announced it is starting a music label, called Pornhub Records.

The announcement was made in a Billboard interview on Wednesday with Pornhub record executives Matt Blake and Corey Price.

'We've always seen a strong music presence from the beginning of Pornhub,' Blake told the website.

'Artists upload their own stuff, like uncensored tracks and R-rated versions of songs,' the head of PR and marketing continued. 'Some people come in and upload exclusive videos, so it creates a buzz for them.'

Pornhub Records also has a newly-revealed song contest, which it says will give artists 'Minimum 5,000 views guaranteed' - but a record deal is not guaranteed as part of the grand prize, Billboard reported.

'We'll help produce the official music video and feature it on Pornhub TV,' Pornhub promises online.

'A&R is a work in progress,' Blake told Billboard. 'Right now it's all about forming relationships and understanding how this all works. We're focused on distributing through the platform and digital sales.'

Artists Coolio, Xiu Xiu and FaltyDL already have videos with the new music company, the  website reported.

Price revealed to Billboard 'We're looking for acts that aren't necessarily porn-focused.'

'We're an ad-based network looking for content that appeals to our demographic,' the vice president continued. 'Mature lyrics for an adult audience; no boy bands or teen-pop, for instance.'

Price also said that 'Producers, music technicians, everyone in the business you could imagine' contacted the record label. 'There's erotic folk, rap, country - everybody has come to us.' 

Price revealed to MailOnline that adult film stars have even expressed interest in music careers. 

'We’ve been approached by all sorts of people – from adult stars, to mainstream celebs, to music producers, sound engineers etc. It’s been a work-in-progress so far, so we’re pretty happy with where we’ve come getting everything off the ground. As far as signing, we’re definitely considering some of the folks who’ve approached us, especially if they’re talented, but this label and the song contest are for the people first. 

'Our whole mission is to put the word out and catch the attention of fledgling musicians or enthusiasts that are looking for a platform for their art. It’s the fans and viewers that have helped us grow into what we are, and so this is mainly a way for us to give back to the community; to give people a voice.' 

Asked if the record label will release new music soundtracks, as opposed to '70-style funk soundtracks stereotypically associated with adult films, Price said 'while 70s funk soundtracks may have been the rage 40+ years ago, I don’t think it’s necessarily the case now. But hey, that’s what this contest and this label is all about – hopefully we’ll get our hands on some amazing material to put out.'
