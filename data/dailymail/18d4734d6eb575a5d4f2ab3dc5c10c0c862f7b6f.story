A family's pet dog has miraculously been found after he went missing in Central Australia for almost a decade.

Donovan Baarda, who lives in Sydney, believed his beloved Jack Russell Terrier, Zippy, was gone forever until he received an email from the Alice Springs Veterinary Hospital, in the Northern Territory.

They told Mr Baarda that Zippy had been hit by a car and was being treated for lacerations to his abdomen.

Donovan Baarda, who lives in Sydney, believed his beloved Jack Russell Terrier, Zippy(pictured), was gone forever until he received an email from the Alice Springs Veterinary Hospital, in the Northern Territory.

Vet nurse from Alice Springs Veterinary Hospital, Lee Blomfield, told Daily Mail Australia they tracked down Mr Baarda’s email through the national animal registry.

‘When Donovan told us he lived in Sydney we thought, “How is Zippy in Alice Springs when you are in Sydney?”

He told them Zippy went missing about nine years ago after he jumped from his brother’s car while driving to Yuendumu, a remote town in Northern Territory.

Mr Baarda said he searched everywhere for Zippy but had no luck.

‘I haven’t seen him for at least nine years,’ Mr Baarda told ntnews.com.au.

Now, the chance for Mr Baarda to reunite with his long lost dog proved more difficult than it seemed.

Ms Blomfield said Mr Baarda agreed to pay for Zippy’s medical bills, but hoped that the person who had been caring for him would come forward.

A family's pet dog called Zippy (pictured) has miraculously been found after he went missing in Central Australia for almost a decade

That's a long way : A decade after Zippy, the pet dog, went missing in Central Australia he has been found and his original owner contacted. Zippy had been hit by a car and was being treated for lacerations to his abdomen

‘Donovan didn’t want to disrupt his life. He knew he wouldn’t remember him at all.

‘If no one came forward he said he would organise for his ex-wife, who lives in Victoria, to take the dog.’

Luckily Michael Barry, from Alice Springs, saw an article online that included a picture of the injured Jack Russell Terrier. The article urged anyone with information to come forward.

‘That’s Jack!’ Mr Barry said.

Mr Barry told Daily Mail Australia that he picked up ‘Zippy’ around nine years ago after dropping his daughter to school.

‘I asked a bike rider close by if he (the dog) was his and he said no, so I opened my door and he jumped in the car,’ Mr Barry said.

'Jack's been with us ever since.'  

Zippy went missing ten years ago after he jumped from the owners brother’s car while driving to Yuendumu, a remote town in Northern Territory.

Zippy or Jack has been treated for his injuries and is expected to make a swift recovery

‘Jack’, Zippy’s new name, was rushed to the Alice Springs Veterinary Hospital after a lady accidentally ran him over with her car nearly two weeks ago. 

He had been missing for a few days before Mr Barry discovered what had happened.  

‘I started worrying and called the RSPCA every day but a vet told me sometimes old dogs wander off to die,’ Mr Barry said.  

Jack has been treated for his injuries and is expected to make a swift recovery.

‘I am taking him to the vet tomorrow to get his stitches removed,’ Mr Barry said.
