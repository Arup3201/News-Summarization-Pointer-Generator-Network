Sarah Storey stormed to victory in the women's cycling road race today to claim her eleventh Paralympic gold medal, prompting speculation she could be in line for a damehood.

The swimmer-turned-cyclist took first place at Brands Hatch with an imperious performance in the women's C4-5 road race for her fourth gold of the London 2012.

With the win Storey completed a clean sweep of her cycling events at the Games.

Her career total of 11 gold medals matches the achievements of Paralympic greats Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and Dave Roberts.

The 34-year-old's achievement is particularly impressive because she has earned her medals in two different sports.

She won the first of her five Paralympic golds in swimming at the Barcelona Games of 1992, when she was only 14 years old.

She switched to cycling in 2005 following an ear infection, and today's victory brought her sixth gold medal in the sport.

Storey attacked from the start of the eight-lap event and finished in one hour 40 minutes, ahead of the men's C1-3 field which started in front of her.

Speaking after the race, the 
Manchester-based cyclist said: 'I can't believe I pulled it off today. 
I'm just so chuffed, it was amazing.'

She hailed the fans who lined the track, adding: 'I wanted to say thank you to the crowds but had to keep my head down.

'I just can't get over it.'

The only Briton to have more success 
in the Paralympics is swimmer Mike Kenny, who won 16 gold medals from 1976 to 1988, with some of his successes coming in a 25-metre pool.

Speaking before Storey's latest gold, Baroness Grey-Thompson praised Storey's versatility and dedication to her 'second sport'.

'She's been such an amazing athlete for years,' she said.

'I've known Sarah since she was 14, 
since her first Paralympics. We go back a long way. I've been around 
when she's had ups and downs.

'As a friend, you want her to do the best she can and I want her to do really well.

'It's good for her and for cycling that she's going well. With two track, two road, it's a pretty tough schedule.'

Storey's win comes just a day after 
she romped to victory in the women's C5 cycling time trial with a time 
of 22 minutes 40 seconds, also at Brands Hatch.

During this year's Games she has also 
taken two golds in the velodrome.

Storey also competes against able-bodied 
athletes and this year only just missed on a place in the Olympic team 
for the women's team pursuit.

Speaking about matching Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson's Paralympic medal haul, Storey said: 'It is fantastic, a
 great feeling. I didn't expect to be able to catch her as quickly.

'I 
suppose it did look easy but mentally you have to prepare and make it 
happen. I have to respect all my competitors.'

She
 said of her success yesterday in the time trial: ‘To compete in a home Games like this with 
all the crowds is a dream come true and I feel honoured to have been 
here.’

Meanwhile, Great Britain's Mark Colbourne had to settle for silver in the men's C1 time-trial.

Colbourne,
 who won individual pursuit gold in the velodrome, clocked 25mins 29secs
 on the 16km course, but Michael Teuber of Germany pipped him to 
victory, finishing first in 25:16.

It
 was the 42-year-old Welshman's third medal of his first Games after 
breaking his back in a paragliding accident three years ago.

'I gave it everything, I'm happy with my silver,' Colbourne said. 'I'm very proud of what I've done today.'

The switch to cycling

She had met cyclist Barney Storey the previous year and the couple married in 2007.

Storey credits her husband with playing a major role in her transformation from swimmer to cyclist.

She said: ‘His expertise in cycling is just phenomenal.

‘Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo cycling sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grand prix in Europe.

‘Barney’s
 got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came 
along, this big-shouldered raw swimmer, he just taught me everything I 
know.’
