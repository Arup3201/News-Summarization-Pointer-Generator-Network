BMW’s revolutionary new electric i3 car was unveiled to the world in Britain today, promising fun-filled green motoring at under 2p a mile.

The new futuristic-looking green city run-around, said to be one of the most important in the German company's history, was revealed simultaneously in London, New York and Beijing.

BMW engineers said that a full battery charge from empty will cost about £2 and will take it up to 100 miles.

The fuel economy is equivalent to a conventionally-fuelled car doing around 425 miles to the gallon, they added, while a partially charged battery on an overnight charge will cost only 1.6p per mile.

Images of the full production-ready version of the electric super-mini leaked out early on the internet, sparking global interest.

BMW's engineers says the fuel economy of their new electric model is equivalent to a conventionally fuelled car doing around 425 miles to the gallon

But now the covers have officially come 
off the model that customers can buy or lease from showrooms. The event 
was streamed live on the internet at 1.15pm UK time.

First deliveries of the electric i3 
will be in November priced from £25,680 - which includes a £5,000 
taxpayer-funded ‘green’ subsidy courtesy of the UK Government.

BMW is also introducing a ‘range-extender’ version  at £28,830, which features an additional 650cc two-cylinder petrol engine to maintain the battery charge and extend the range to between 160 miles and 186miles on one tank of fuel.

This version is aimed at people who suffer from ‘range-anxiety’ – a fear of being left stranded before reaching their destination -  and has average emissions of just 13g/kilometre.

BMW’s global sales and marketing director Dr Ian Robertson said: ’The i3 has re-written the rule book. After 100 years of landlines the mobile telephone opened up so many opportunities and changed the face of the communications industry.

'Electric vehicles will do the same for individual mobility. The car has been around for 130 years and today marks a change in the future of mobility. One thing the i3 will share with every other BMW is sheer driving pleasure.’

The car can be connected wirelessly to the driver’s smartphone so they can check the charge in the battery before and after a journey.

As it is driven around, the i3 also 
keeps the driver in touch with traffic conditions, telling him or her 
where to park, find a charging point and even when the next train is 
leaving if you are heading out of town into the countryside.

A phone app will let drivers know at 
any time where they have parked their car – or guide them on foot to 
their final  destination after they park up.

A 'driving range assistant' linked to the car's sat-nav will look at the battery's charge and work out whether the destination is too far for the vehicle to go.

If so, the assistant can suggest switching to a more economical driving mode or direct the driver to a public charging station.

It even takes account of traffic jams, uphill climbs, and stop-start conditions ‘to make allowances for the energy required.’

Innovation: The German company is hoping its new electric car will be a breakthrough for the industry

Also, to save energy, the electric 
motor switches from ‘drive’ to ‘generator mode once the driver takes his
foot off the accelerator, feeding power into the lithium ion battery 
and helping the car ‘brake itself’.

BMW said: ’This  recharging effect is
speed sensitive which means the car ‘coasts’ with maximum efficiency at
high speeds and generates strong braking effect at low speeds.’

It noted: ‘Thinking ahead in city 
traffic can allow the driver to carry out  75 per cent of braking 
manoeuvres without applying the brake pedal.’

The i3 is rear-wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor, and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre-reinforced plastic and aluminium construction.

It has a range of around 80 to 100 miles and can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 7.2 seconds with a top speed of 93mph.

The battery can re-charge 80 per cent of its power within three hours. 

Interior: Traditional dials have been replaced by digital screens inside the i3, according to pictures

Coming soon: The car will be launched on Monday in three 'mega-cities' - London, New York and Beijing

Difficulties: Many customers are put off electric cars by the scarcity of charging points for them

The British capital was chosen for the world premiere because of its trendy image and promotion of low-polluting cars which are exempt from London’s controversial Congestion Charge.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is set to get a personal view of the car tomorrow.

He said:  ‘It is fantastic to see a great brand like BMW introducing such a striking electric vehicle to the mainstream market. This shows that industry, like Government, is serious about this technology.’

The Government recently announced an extra £500million investment  – matched by the automotive industry – to boost  ultra-low emission vehicles:

‘This is some of the most long-sighted and comprehensive support for these vehicles anywhere in the world and will put Britain in the vanguard of this growing market,' Mr McLoughlin said.

The i3 is built in  Leipzig in Eastern Germany, where new production processes means the plant uses less energy, less water and produces less noise.

Charge: Ahead of next week's UK launch, BMW is set to buy a stake in a pioneering British company which produces and installs half of the UK's charging points for electric cars

The i3 will be at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, where it will be on show alongside the production version of the i8 hybrid supercar

Dr Robertson - the only Briton on the German firm’s board - said: ‘The BMW i3 heralds the dawn of a new era for individual mobility and for the BMW Group.

'It has strong emotional appeal, outstanding product substance and a guarantee of sheer driving pleasure.

'With this leading-edge vehicle and compelling price, we will provide customers with an attractive offer for electromobility.’

The i3 will be at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, where it will be on show alongside the production version of the i8 hybrid supercar.

The two models will kick-start a new ‘i’ family of electric BMW cars that could eventually include an i4 coupe and i5 saloon.

Subsidised: Each model sold in the UK comes with a £5,000 payment from the British Government

Reverse: The i3 can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 7.2 seconds with a top speed of 93mph

Ahead of next week’s UK launch, BMW is set to buy a stake in a pioneering British company which produces and installs half of the UK's charging points for electric cars.

The German car-maker is set to invest up to £500,000 in Chargemaster which is based near Luton.

The European Commission demands that 795,000 charging points are installed across the Continent by 2020.

The UK Government is subsidising up to 75 per cent of the cost of domestic charging points, according to the British company's flotation documents.

Annual European demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure is expected to reach $1billion (£650million) by 2021.

Chargemaster
makes money by supplying home, workplace and public charging units for 
motor manufacturers such as Nissan, Renault and Toyota as well as local 
authorities and supermarkets.

The i3 is rear-wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor, and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre-reinforced plastic and aluminium construction

Growth in electric car use has been hampered by too few public charging points and exacerbated by a phenomenon known as ‘range anxiety’ – a fear by motorists that their batteries will run out of juice and leave them stranded.

Chargemaster was set up by David Martell, the entrepreneur who made his first fortune from the creation of the Trafficmaster satellite navigation system, who owns 50 per cent of the company.

Customers can also lease an i3 by putting down a deposit of £2,995 and paying £369 per month over 36 months.

As part of the deal they can also borrow an X5 or a Z4 for a limited period of time depending on their needs.
