A Sydney man is suing the Australian Tax Office for $5.8 million after a seven-year battle over an audit he says has destroyed his life.

Gary Kurzer, 62, from Bondi says he lost his business, defaulted on his mortgage, suffered mental health problems and split from his partner of 28 years due to his legal fight against the ATO over a bungled tax bill.

The audit began in December 2007 after he and his former partner sold two rental properties they owned in Terrigal, and the ATO claimed they owed $200,000 in GST plus tax on 'a $667,000 profit'.

'In fact we'd actually made losses on the sale - we lost money we didn't make money,' Mr Kurzer told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Kurzer said his tax bill was eventually revised down to just over $8,000 following objections, appeals, an appearance at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2010 and an admittance from the ATO that it had issued 'contradictory and unsustainable objections decisions'.

Following the AAT decision which found the couple did not owe GST or tax, Mr Kurzer claims the ATO again began pursuing him for amounts of up to $230,000.

'This is the situation that taxpayers like myself find we have to battle for anything up to seven years,' he said.

'Unfortunately in that process you lose everything.'

The former architect is now suing the tax office for misfeasance and will represent himself in the NSW Federal Court on September 22.

In its legal defence, the Tax Office said it did not owe Mr Kurzer duty of care, The Canberra Times reported.

The case comes as the ATO has been under fire has come under fire for the way it handles taxpayer disputes following a report from the Inspector General of Taxation published last week.

The report found that about one third of the $4.25 billion in penalties imposed by the tax office in the past three years had been unfair and subsequently reduced.

Mr Kurzer has rejected a settlement offer from the ATO, because he wants to take a stand against their 'incompetence and bullying'.

'I personally am now at retirement age and I find myself destitute as a result of this and I think that's pretty unfair given it was their mistake,' he said.

'This kind of collateral damage is happening every day.'

An ATO spokesman told the Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on the case as it is before the court.
