Brazilian police have uncovered a huge ring operating on the 'dark internet' - a seething matrix of encrypted websites allowing users to browse with complete anonymity.

The year-long 'Operation Darknet' uncovered a large haul of child pornography that had been made in Brazil and was being distributed in four other countries.

The operation has so far led to the arrests of 55 people, with police issuing a further 100 arrest and search warrants and suspects found in Portugal, Italy, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela.

Operation Darknet was launched simultaneously in 18 Brazilian states and the federal district of Brasilia last year. 

During the year-long investigation, six children were rescued from suspected rapists and abusers. 

At a press conference in Rio, Chief of Police of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Sandro Luciano Caron, said: 'We managed to identify people who were trying to distribute child pornography materials and also those who have abused children.'

More than 90 people who shared the child porn images have so far been identified, with the majority of them known child abusers, he added.

Until now, only the FBI and Scotland Yard have managed to break into the dark internet, but Caron said Brazilian police have since been able to adopt the same investigative techniques.

Caron said a number of harrowing details emerged during the investigation, including one man who allegedly started planning the  abuse of his child while his unsuspecting wife was still pregnant.

The nature and extent of some of the abuse shocked and horrified even the most experienced officers involved in the investigation, he added. 

Operation Darknet is considered the latest example of South American governments finally starting to address the problem of the sexual exploitation of children.

Earlier this week Colombia broke up a child-trafficking operation in which children as young as 12 are believed to have been smuggled out of the country for sex. Seven people were arrested.

Tor - short for The onion Router - is a  matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity.

It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online.

Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer.

The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user.

Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search.

An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed.
