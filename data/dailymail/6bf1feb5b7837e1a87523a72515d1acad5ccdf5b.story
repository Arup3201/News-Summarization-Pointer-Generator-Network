Arsenal forward Theo Walcott is relishing the chance to play against north London rivals Tottenham on Saturday. 

The 25-year-old enjoys the fierce competition between the two clubs and famously reminded Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline with a cheeky hand gesture during Arsenal's FA Cup victory last season.

But Walcott insists his antics were all in good fun and to be expected during such a hugely significant game.

'Me and the Tottenham fans have a good relationship in terms of the banter side of things', he told the Evening Standard. 

'That's what comes with football. This is a massive game and it is all about the bragging rights.

'Things like that have happened in the past and it won't be forgotten about, I'm sure, but it is one thing I've moved on from. Every player will get stick I am sure but it is about just trying to go out there and perform.

'Any criticism won't affect me at all. It is enjoyable — it's a bit different and it is always a great atmosphere at White Hart Lane. It is probably the fixture I always look forward to playing in the most, to be fair. It is one of the biggest games for both sets of fans and this year it is going to be tight.'

Arsenal are currently fifth in the Premier League table with 42 points and have not lost since New Year's Day

Walcott heads into Saturday's derby having scored in Arsenal's last two games against Brighton and Aston Villa.  

The Gunners not have lost since their New Year's Day defeat to Southampton and last month's 2-0 win over the champions Manchester City has proven to be the catalyst for a superb upturn in form that shows no signs of dipping.

But Spurs are on a similarly good run themselves and have lost just one of their last nine league games, a shock 2-1 result to Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace.   

With arguably five teams vying for third and fourth place in the Premier League this year, Saturday's derby has seen its stakes undoubtedly raised.

Tottenham are also on a fine run of form and have lost just once in their last nine Premier League games  

Just five points separate third placed Manchester United and seventh placed Liverpool, with Southampton, Arsenal and Spurs occupying the places in between.

With all of these teams targeting qualification for next season's Champions League, the north London derby is perhaps as important as it has ever been. 

'I think it is an even bigger game this year than ever,' said Walcott. 'Tottenham are doing very well, getting those last-minute goals which shows a knack of getting important three points. It will be two very strong teams that are very high on confidence so for the neutral it will be a very interesting game.'
