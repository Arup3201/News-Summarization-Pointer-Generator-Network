Fernando Torres has spoken of his delight at being back in his national setup after a spending a year in the Spanish wilderness.

The Chelsea striker has not started for Spain since last summer's 3-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil in the Confederations Cup final - a game in which he was unceremoniously hauled off after 59 minutes.

Torres was actually the joint top scorer in the tournament -along with Brazil striker Fred - but in fairness four of his five goals did came in their 10-0 group stage drubbing of minnows Tahiti.VIDEO: Scroll down for Spain boss Del Bosque delays naming 23-man squad

A mixture of injuries and dreadful form had kept the 30-year-old out of Vicente del Bosque's team all season, but a slight upturn in performances towards the end convinced his national manager that he was worthy of a place in the provisional 30-man list.

And Torres will get a chance to prove his worth in the upcoming warm up game against Bolivia, having been named in a 19-man squad that has omitted other strikers Fernando Llorente, Alvaro Negredo and the injured Diego Costa.

'It's very nice to be back with the national team. I've gone a year without being with La Roja, since the Confederations Cup,' he said.

'I knew that anything could happen. Yesterday, I was only hoping to hear my name. I knew that I could've been here or not, but now I have a better chance of being in Brazil.

'It's been a difficult year but I finished the season very well. I'm grateful for the words of Vicente, who has valued my performances in the final phases.

'There's always been a lot of 
competition here since the 2008 European Championships: (Fernando) 
Morientes, Raul, (David) Villa, (Roberto) Soldado, Negredo, now 
Costa...

'The level is very high, but we're not rivals, we're team-mates 
and whoever is chosen to play has the support of everyone.

'Now to fight during these days to be in the final list for Brazil.'

Torres links up with his national team on the back of what has been a mixed season for Chelsea.

The Blues have enjoyed plenty of success over the last decade but suffered a rare barren year in 2013/14 under returning coach Jose Mourinho, although they did finish third in the Premier League and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League.

'It's been a strange year overall, one of transition at the club," said Torres, who scored 11 times for Chelsea last season.

'We've been close in everything but in the end we've not managed to get anything after several years of winning titles.

'On a personal level, it's been the same. But to be here (with Spain) is a great prize.

'I've played less minutes than in other seasons and, maybe, that could be good to be better physically. I feel very good.

'I'm happy and looking forward to getting started.'
