Whether grainy movie reels featuring marching armies of khaki-clad soldiers heading towards the front line or harrowing images that reveal the aftermath in bloody detail, World War One was among the first to be documented in photos and on film.

Now a new exhibition is to combine rarely seen photos of men and women fighting in the Great War with a series of harrowing artworks that shed light on the human tragedy that ensued.

The Great War in Portraits, which debuts at the National Portrait Gallery next month, also tells the stories of some of the most fascinating participants, among them a Russian female soldier, a British nurse executed by the Germans and the first Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross.

The Gassed and Wounded: Eric Kennington's 1918 work was based on sketches made on the front line

Harrowing: Two of the portraits from Henry Tonks' series, Soldiers With Facial Wounds

Others, among them the striking Henry Tonks' series, Soldiers With Facial Wounds, document the experience of disfigured British soldiers and their treatment in the hands of Dr Harold Gilles - one of the founding fathers of modern cosmetic surgery.

His techniques, pioneered at the Cambridge Hospital at Aldershot and The Queen's Hospital in Sidcup, were used to reconstruct the faces of injured soldiers, with Tonks on hand to provide the before and after shots.

Equally startling is Gilbert Rogers 1919 effort, The Dead Stretcher Bearer, which was commissioned by the government-sponsored Committee for the Medical History of the War.

Charged with recording the medical consequences of the war, Rogers, who served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, offers a painfully frank account of the risks faced by both soldiers and support staff.

Record: Gilbert Rogers was commissioned to paint The Dead Stretcher Bearer in 1919

But not every soldier to appear in the new exhibition does so through an artists' gaze. Many more peer shyly out of the exhibition's vast collection of photographs.

And it's not just men: some of World War One's female participants feature, among them Mata Hari, the exotic Dutch dancer executed by the French after being accused of spying for the Germans, and Maria Bochkareva, a Russian peasant woman who became a soldier with the blessing of Tsar Nicholas.

Although badly injured in 1916, Bochkareva later went on to form the 2,000-strong 1st Russian Womenâ€™s Battalion of Death in 1917.

Sadly ,after the Bolshevik Revolution ended Russia's involvement in the Great War, Bochkareva was deemed surplus to requirements and was executed in 1920 by the Communist regime.

Another woman to suffer a similar fate was British nurse, Edith Cavell, whose daguerreotype portrait also appears in the exhibition.

Executed: Maria Bochkareva died at the hands of the Bolsheviks while Mata Hari was killed by the French

Brave: British nurse Edith Cavell ran a network of safe houses for Allied soldiers but was executed in 1915

Her story began in the village of Swardeston in Norfolk, where she grew up before moving to London to train as a nurse in 1896.

In 1907, she moved to Brussels to become the director of a training school for nurses but was caught behind enemy lines after the German invasion of Belgium in 1914.

The school became part of a network of safe houses created to shelter Allied soldiers before smuggling them into the Netherlands.

Less than a year after the invasion, Cavell was caught by the Germans and on the 12th October 1915, she was executed by firing squad. Her final words were, 'I am glad to die for my country.'

Unlike Cavell, not every soldier fighting in the war did battle on behalf of the country of his birth. As the exhibition makes plain, many troops fighting for Britain hailed from the Commonwealth.

In addition to 100,000 formidable, knife-wielding Gurkhas, troops from India, Australia, Uganda and New Zealand went into battle alongside their British brethren.

Kulbir Thapa was the first Nepalese soldier to win the Victoria Cross

Shahamad Khan, a Punjabi Muslim, also won the UK's highest military honour

Private Ivor Evans, from Swansea, enlisted at 15 and was killed aged 18

Captured: This German soldier was taken prisoner by Scottish and South African troops at Passchendaele

Among them was Kulbir Thapa, the first Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross, whose heroics saved the lives of three injured comrades during the 1915 Battle of Loos.

Another was Shamad Khan, a Punjabi Muslim serving in the 89th Punjabis, British Indian Army, who earned a Victoria Cross while fighting on the Tigris Front.

Equally brave were British recipients of the UK's highest military honour, among them Private Reginald Roy Inwood who won his for capturing an enemy strong point and nine prisoners single-handedly.

Peering out of grainy black and white photos, the portraits of Private Inwood and his comrades offer a very human perspective of what turned out to be a spectacularly inhuman struggle.
