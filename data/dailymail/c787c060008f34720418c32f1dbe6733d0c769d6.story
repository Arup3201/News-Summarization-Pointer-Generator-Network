With his declamatory Scottish tones and often damning catchphrases — diabolical, woeful, shocking, abysmal, time and time again — Alan Hansen does not immediately strike the viewer as a man beset by self-doubt.

Just as the memory of his elegant defending at the back of some of the greatest Liverpool teams does not reveal a man of a nervous disposition.

But the real Hansen, who retires from two decades of authoritative football punditry after Sunday’s World Cup final, possesses a sensitive core.

We glimpsed it when his eyes welled up during the Hillsborough segment of the last BBC Sports Personality of the Year show and in a tribute to be aired tonight he and his family have explained how this ‘wee boy from Sauchie’ is really a softy at heart.

But, first, to the beginning of Hansen’s sporting journey. Despite being raised in a village in the central lowlands of Scotland, where, as Hansen puts it, you played football . . . or played football, his first love was golf.

And it was as a golfer that the young Hansen wanted to make his career. He changed direction after watching Partick Thistle beat mighty Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final in 1971.

Although Hansen had thought about studying history at Aberdeen University or PE at college, he joined his brother John by signing for Partick.

Football, he admits, was almost the last resort.

After four years at Firhill, he moved to Bob Paisley’s Liverpool in 1977. ‘I was very shy and introverted,’ says Hansen. ‘I went to Liverpool at 21. I felt out of my depth. I was so nervous that I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want to leave Scotland. The more experienced I got at Liverpool, I’m thinking the nerves will disappear.

‘They got worse. I would sit in the dressing room with the programme — I’d never warm up — singing the Billy Joel line “Don’t Go Changing”. Underneath I am churning. I was scared.’

He would always touch the ‘This is Anfield’ sign with both hands and suddenly there was ‘not a nerve in my body,’ transforming him into the strolling presence that won eight League titles, three European  Cups and two FA Cups — a dazzling c.v. which included captaining the club to the 1986 double.

Born: Sauchie, near Stirling.Position: Centre back (and sidekick to Gary Lineker on the Match of the Day sofa).

CLUB CAREER Played for Partick and Liverpool, who paid £100,000 for him on Jock Stein’s advice.Liverpool: 620 games, 14 goals.

CLUB HONOURSLeague title: 8 (1979, 80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 88, 90).European Cup: 3 (1978, 81, 84)FA Cup: 2 (1986, 89).League Cup: 4 (1981, 82, 83, 84).

INTERNATIONAL CAREERScotland: 26 caps, 0 goals.

Sheer delight: Hansen punches the air as Liverpool beat Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to secure the First Division title in May 1986

He met his wife Janet on a night out in Liverpool, telling her he worked in insurance. ‘My whole family say she saved me,’ he says.

When his career ended, he did not countenance management because the nerves would have been a ‘thousand times’ worse.

Management’s loss was television’s gain.
