The widow of a Florida cardiologist is inconsolable after thieves ransacked her Fort Lauderdale home and slit the throat of her beloved dog.

When 69-year-old Elaine Vasquez came home just after noon on January 21, she found her back door had been smashed open.

When police arrived to investigate, they followed a trail of blood to a closet where the body of Mrs Vasquez's dog, Papi, was found hanging.

Connection: Elaine Vasquez with her late husband, Erwin, who owned the dog

A bloodied knife was found in the hallway, and the words 'You next' had been scrawled into the grandmother's front door.

When Mrs Vasquez was told that Papi had been killed she was devastated. The dog had belonged to her husband, Erwin Vasquez, who died in 2010.

Family friend Sandra Lozano, who works at the free Light of the World clinic Mrs Vasquez's husband had set up, was shaken by the incident.

'What kind of people could do that?' she said to the Orlando Sentinel. 'We were all moved because we knew how much Papi meant to Elaine. He was Erwin's dog, and her connection to him.'

'She babied that dog like she babied her grandchildren,' Ms Lozano added.

As well as killing one of the grandmother's dogs, thieves ransacked every room, according to a police report.

Mrs Vasquez was at a loss as to why she had been targeting, saying 'I don't know who hates me.'

Several items were reported stolen, but details have not been released about what was taken.

Neighbors reported seeing a white SUV near the single-storey home near the time of the break in.

Mrs Vasquez's daughter, Lisa Miceli, said her mother had also reported seeing a suspicious car outside her home on December 31.
