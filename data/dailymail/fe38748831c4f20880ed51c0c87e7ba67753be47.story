UEFA will not take action against CSKA Moscow after around 200 supporters appeared inside the Arena Khimki during the ‘behind-closed-doors’ Champions League group match with Manchester City.

However, the governing body has confirmed to Sportsmail that they will be reviewing their policy on such matches where fans are banned from the stadium.

UEFA – who had ordered the game to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans – said in a statement: ‘Following Tuesday’s match between CSKA Moscow and Manchester City, UEFA has reviewed the officials’ reports and found no breach of the conditions related to a match played behind closed doors that make part of the disciplinary decision.

‘Only people who were allowed to enter the stadium (club delegations, media, security staff, UEFA and guests of sponsorship partners) attended the match with no record of inappropriate behaviour.

‘However, UEFA is reviewing the “behind closed doors” policy to see if alternative solutions could be implemented in the future.’

The fans were seen drinking alcohol and chanting during the game which saw City draw 2-2 after Seydou Doumbia's close-range finish and Natcho's late penalty cancelled out first-half goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner.

It is claimed they could have obtained the match tickets through sponsors who had been allocated seats for the game.

Manchester City fans were not allocated tickets under the UEFA ruling.

And captain Vincent Kompany said afterwards that they were the ones being punished.

'It's supposed to be a game without fans but yet there are still 500 fans cheering on for them, which is not a problem, but I don't understand where our fans are,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Why can we not bring our fans? 

'I feel like the only team being punished today was Man City.

'Probably pundits and the people writing the column will say well, you know, we should be looking at what our team did, so we'll do that and we'll improve, but (there are) little things where I think sometimes we need to speak up. I mean, it's nonsense.

'They're the team that got done for racism, not Man City. Why can't our fans come?

'It doesn't affect us, but fair is fair and maybe now is the time to say it and now is the time to speak up.'

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was not afraid to point out that CSKA fans were allowed in to watch

Kompany questioned who was being punished after CSKA fans appeared to have been allowed in 

Despite Milner and Aguero's efforts, the game ended 2-2 meaning City have failed to win in Europe this season
