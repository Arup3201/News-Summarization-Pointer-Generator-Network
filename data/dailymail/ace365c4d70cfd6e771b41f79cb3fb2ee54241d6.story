Kit Symons believes he has done enough to land the manager’s job at Craven Cottage after he guided Fulham out of the bottom three.

Under Symons Fulham have won 13 of their 14 points this season since he replaced Felix Magath in September.

And Fulham wrapped up their third home win in a row against London rivals Charlton thanks to a goal from Scott Parker and two from Hugo Rodallega.

And Symons said: ‘I am very confident I will get the job. It has got to be becoming more and more difficult not to when the team keep winning. I would like to think the five man panel will see what the obvious thing and the right thing to do for this football club.

‘I think they are very aware that I want the job and take this brilliant club forward.

‘The chairman is over the week after next. I don't know what to expect, I understand the process but not when a decision will be made or how it will, come about. Hopefully we'll find out sooner rather than later.’

Parker opened the scoring when he picked up a loose ball in the middle of the Charlton half and made a driving run forward before a neat one-two with Ross McCormack before turning the ball in off the cross bar from five yards out after just six minutes.

Fulham doubled their lead through Rodallega, who was alert enough to poke home from close range after McCormack’s volley from the edge of the area was parried into his path by Stephen Henderson.

Charlton did their best to get back into the game and looked neat and tidy in possession, but lacked the killer instinct in front of goal, George Tucudean had a shot from the edge of the area but it did little to trouble Marcus Bettinelli. 

It took Fulham just six minutes after Parker's opener to double their lead through Hugo Rodallega

Tim Hoogland almost extended Fulham’s lead on the half hour mark, but headed just wide from a McCormack free kick.

Bettinelli was forced to make a save when Johnnie Jackson ghosted in to meet Chris Solly’s cross, but saw his effort tipped round the post for a corner.

Charlton came to life at the start of the second half but were still restricted to shots from distance as Franck Moussa saw his effort go just wide.

As Charlton looked for a way back into the game, they left gaps at the back and substitute Cauley Woodrow and Lasse Vigen Christiansen combined well but the Danish midfielder saw his effort go just wide.

But a third did come right at the end when Rodallega added his second when he was played in by Christiansen, he turned Michael Morrison and slotted the ball past Henderson.

Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: ‘After 10 mins we were comfortable and then Solly lost the ball in the centre and they punished us.

‘We kept on doing the same things and created chances, then we did the same thing on the left and they punished us again.

‘I was very happy with response. Everyone gave their max second half. It’s about scoring the goals and that is what we lacked.

‘We have given Kit a gift today. He owes my players especially for the first half if he gets the job.’

It was a comprehensive win and one that is sure to have been noticed on the other side of the Atlantic by owner Shahid Khan

Khan is due in England in the next fortnight to appoint the new manager but after Symons’ fourth league win from seven he has put himself in the box seat.
