These stunning images show heavy fog at sunset surrounding the south tower of the famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

The eerie pictures were taken by photographer Dave Gordon, 34, a travel photographer from San Francisco, who set out to capture the sunset, and then saw the thick fog engulfing the bridge.

The pictures show how the fog swamped the Golden Gate Bridge, which makes it look as if the bridge leads to nowhere.

Mr Gordon said: 'I was sitting at home when I noticed the sky started changing colours into what I was hoping would be a spectacular sunset.

'I gathered my camera, my wife and our dog and rushed out the door. Fortunately we live less than two miles from the Golden Gate Bridge.

'As we approached, the sky began to bloom into the brilliant sunset colours. I literally sprinted to the top of the viewing area from the car, dropped to my knees, steadied the camera and came away with the photograph.

The pictures show the perfect composition of the thick fog, mixing with amazing cloud formations, and the pink sky from the sunset.

Mr Gordon first started taking photographs as a hobby, when he would go out hiking with his labrador puppy and he now has his own business, specialsing in travel photography.
