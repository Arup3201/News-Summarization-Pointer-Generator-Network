This is the moment a brazen thief stole Christmas presents from a stranger's doorstep in broad daylight after chatting to the delivery driver while the homeowner was inside.

In the shocking footage - recorded days before Christmas - the man is seen lurking on Troy Hall's doorstep for several minutes before sparking up a conversation with a UPS driver as he delivers the parcels.

The thief even allegedly tells the employee to leave the parcels on the homeowner's doorstep, before shamelessly walking off with the goods under his arm.

This is the moment a brazen thief stole Christmas presents from a stranger's doorstep in broad daylight after chatting to the delivery driver while the homeowner was inside

The disturbing incident was only revealed when homeowner Mr Hall wondered why his delivery had not turned up and checked his surveillance camera.

It was then that he saw the stranger walking down his driveway as the UPS delivery truck pulled up outside.  

He then realised that his wife had been inside the couple's home throughout the 'disturbing' incident.

He told KCPG news: 'It's disturbing. Because he seems to know where the cameras are, he’s hiding his face.

'I think what he says is, ‘Would these be safe here?’ The thief says, ‘Yes, sir.’'

The thief even allegedly tells the driver to leave the parcels on the doorstep - before shamelessly walking off with the goods under his arm.

Mr Hall says he is furious that the driver trusted the 'suspicious' stranger and left the parcels on the doorstep without a note, despite his wife being inside at the time. 

He told KCPQ: 'I think I would have left a note or come back later or something different than just slide it right next to the person who's looking very suspicious.' 

Mr Hall complained to UPS about the incident, but the company insisted the driver had followed company policy.

On the company's website, it says drivers will leave deliveries at the front door unless a signature is required.

Homeowner Troy Hall (pictured) said the incident was 'disturbing' and that the driver should have left a note or come back to finish the delivery later

In that case, a note will be left saying an attempt was made to deliver the package and when the next attempt will be made.

Mr Hall's package did not require a signature but he said the driver did not leave a note.

According to a post office spokesman, thieves are no longer opportunistically coming across packages outside houses.

Gus Ruiz told KMAX: 'These parcel pirates are following these trucks and as soon as they drop off a parcel on a doorstep or whatever and they see that it's unattended, they will swoop in and off they go.'
