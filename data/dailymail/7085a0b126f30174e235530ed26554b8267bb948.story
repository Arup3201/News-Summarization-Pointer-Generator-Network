Once there, they found a 15-year-old mini horse - that Wirtz said was stuck in a hole between 3 and 4 feet deep.

Wirtz said the hole seemed to be related to a septic system.

'[The hole] appeared to have been the cesspool of an old septic system, the block wall could be seen on one side of the hole,' he said.

Firefighters reportedly dug a ramp to help the small horse get out. It appeared 'uninjured but agitated' by the incident.
