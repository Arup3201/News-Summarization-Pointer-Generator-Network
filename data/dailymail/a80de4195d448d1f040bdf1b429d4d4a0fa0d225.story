President Barack Obama has described the ebola outbreak in West Africa as ‘a threat to global security’.

His warning was echoed last night by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who said the epidemic in West Africa could become a ‘global catastrophe with disastrous consequences’ without more humanitarian support.

The US President announced plans this week to send 3,000 American troops to the region to help build new healthcare facilities.

'We could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected' in west Africa, Obama warned on Tuesday

Mr Obama said the disease required a ‘global response’ as a worsening outbreak would lead to ‘profound political, economic and security implications for all of us’.

He said: ‘In West Africa, ebola is now an epidemic, of the likes that we have not seen before. It’s spiralling out of control: it is getting worse; it’s spreading faster and exponentially.

‘Today thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands infected.

‘This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It’s a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.’

Obama met Tuesday morning with Dr. Kent Brantly and his wife, Amber. Dr. Brantly contracted the Ebola virus while doing missionary aid work in Liberia, but has recovered completely

Britain is to provide hundreds of extra beds to treat people affected by the deadly virus as part of a £100million aid package. Mr Hammond confirmed work is progressing to provide 200 beds to Sierra Leone while a further 500 will be supplied in the coming months. Last week it was announced that British military personnel are setting up a 62-bed ebola treatment centre near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.

Meanwhile, a healthy British woman became the first volunteer to receive a potentially life-saving new vaccine to tackle the virus yesterday.

Ruth Atkins was injected with the experimental drug at Oxford University as part of a safety trial.

If successful, it will be used to treat patients in West Africa where 2,500 people have now died.

The 48-year-old from Marcham in Oxfordshire is one of 60 volunteers taking part in the UK trial over the coming weeks, which has been fast-tracked because of the worsening outbreak. After being given her injection, she said: ‘I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday.’

Mrs Atkins, an NHS communications manager who has also worked as a nurse, will keep a diary of her side effects over the next eight weeks and have regular blood tests. She said she volunteered ‘because the situation in West Africa is so tragic’.

Ten thousand doses of the drug are being manufactured by British drug company GlaxoSmithKline in the hope it will be approved for use.
