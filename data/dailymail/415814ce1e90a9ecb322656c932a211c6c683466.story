The former home of first lady Betty Ford has been destroyed in an early morning fire in Ohio.

Fire officials in Maumee  say the home once occupied by Ford and her first husband, William Warren, was destroyed in a fire that began early Saturday around 3am.

The Blade in Toledo reports Ford and Warren lived in the house in 1942 and 1943 while she modeled and sold merchandise at a department store.

The couple divorced after five years of marriage and Betty went on to marry future president Gerald Ford in 1948. She died in 2011.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the fire chief says investigators believe it began in the basement.

The chief says the fire engulfed the roof and floors, making the home a total loss. No occupants were inside. 

'It’ll be torn down, unfortunately. It’s a historic home in Maumee,' Maumee Fire Chief Brandon Loboschefski said.

A homeowner at the scene of the fire said that it was an investment property, and that they were carrying out renovations on the home. 

Neighbor Bert Trochelman told the Blade that the house had been unoccupied for years despite having several owners.

He says there were workers on Friday cutting trees at the property.
