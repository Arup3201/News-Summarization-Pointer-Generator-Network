From the Atkins to the Dukan diet, there have been hundreds of eating programmes over the years promising to aid weight loss.

Most recently, the 5:2 diet,
which advocates eating just 500 calories (600 for men) on two 
non-consecutive days each week, then normally for the other five, became the diet-de-jour.

But now it seems that dieters are taking a step back in time and turning to the flappers for inspiration.

As art deco spectacle The Great Gatsby is launched in cinemas the 90-year-old diet technique followed by glamorous 1920s flapper girls is experiencing a resurgence.

Blast from the past: The 1920s saw flappers as the feminine ideal and to achieve the look they embarked on The Hay Diet, which is seeing a resurgence

Famous fans: Liz Hurley and Catherine Zeta Jones are followers of The Hay Diet, which is making a comeback from the 1920s when it was first founded

First created in the 1920s by physician William Howard Hay, the Hay Diet was created to achieve the slim, 
hip-less, flat-chested look of the dancers.

Its principles have stood the test of time and it has garnered much praise by nutrition experts for its far-reaching health benefits as well as its ability to help manage body weight.

Unlike faddy crash diets or cleanses, the Hay Diet promotes the idea that it's not so much what you eat, but what you choose to eat with it- artist Man Rey was a notable fan in the 1920s and modern fans include Elizabeth Hurley and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

The Hay Diet is based on the principle 
of segregating certain food types to maintain a healthy weight and the key to the diet is understanding that some food groups shouldn't be consumed with others.

One such mix is carbohydrates and proteins. Whilst following the Hay Diet no one meal should contain both protein and carbohydrates at one sitting.

How it works: The Hay Diet is based on the principle of segregating certain food types to maintain a healthy weight and the key to the diet is understanding that some food groups shouldn't be consumed with others, but is it really effective?

This is because dieters believe that the body's natural ability to digest food and burn fat is hindered and slowed down by tackling both protein and carbohydrate foods at the same time.

In the Hay Diet framework, food is also grouped into two further categories - alkaline and acidic.

This is to ensure that ones diet is not too acidic as this is believed to be the cause of health complications such as acid indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

High acidic foods they advise avoided are cranberries, white flour and cheese, which should be replaced by low acidic foods such as spinach, plums and eggs.

Foods high in alkaline are lemons, asparagus and mangoes, with bananas, tomatoes and peas being a better option.

The diet is also known to have greatly benefitted followers suffering with serious health complications such as allergies, arthritis and diabetes.

Creator of newly launched website HayDiet.co.uk Philip Edwards said: 'Several celebrities and health experts have been very vocal about their positive experiences with the Hay Diet.

No mixing: Whilst following the Hay Diet no one meal should contain both protein and carbohydrates at one sitting, but some nutritionists say this is 'unfounded'

'It is the perfect method for those who are looking to implement clean, healthy habits to boost their fat-burning abilities and boost their energy levels rather than a get-thin-quick scheme which often fails and leaves dieters with low energy and no significant difference in their weight.'

Whilst it counts celebrities as fans, the theory that carbohydrate and protein rich foods should be eaten separately is considered 'unfounded' by some nutritionists who claim it ignores the fact that carbohydrate rich foods all contain significant amounts of protein.

'Eating protein separately from carbohydrates also tends to cause the body to burn the protein as an energy source rather than to build muscle', writes David Bender in A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition.

THE GRAPEFRUIT DIET: The Grapefruit diet, also known as the Hollywood Diet and the 18-Day Diet today, saw women consume only 800 calories a day. They would munch on ‘fat-burning’ grapefruits to kick-start their metabolism, believing that if you ate grapefruit with unhealthy foods, it would somehow block fat.

THE CHEW-CHEW DIET: Dating back to the Art Nouveau period, Art dealer Horace Fletcher, known as The Great Masticator, advocated a diet technique where you should chew but not swallow your food. He claimed by chewing on a piece of food 25 times but spitting it out would help you lose pounds.

THE CIGARETTE DIET: In 1925 doctors prescribed tobacco cigarettes to patients wanting to shed pounds.

THE TAPE-WORM DIET: The idea was that if you ingested a tapeworm, it would magically eat up all your food for you.
