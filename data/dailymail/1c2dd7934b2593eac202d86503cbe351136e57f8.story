Disgraced former Downing Street spin chief Andy Coulson is to face perjury charges in Scotland, it was revealed tonight.

The ex News of the World editor, who became one of David Cameron's closest advisers, will be hauled before the High Court in Glasgow in connection with the trial of former MSP Tommy Sheridan.

The announcement is a body blow for Mr Coulson, who was sentenced to 18 months in jail just last week for phone hacking.

Former Downing Street spin chief Andy Coulson will face charges of perjury. It comes less than a week after he was sentenced to 18 months behind bars for phone hacking

Mr Coulson is expected to attend a preliminary hearing on August 6, the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution authority - confirmed tonight.

The 46-year-old father of three is accused of committing perjury while giving evidence at Mr Sheridan’s own perjury trial.

Mr Sheridan was found guilty of perjury in 2010, and jailed for three years.

Coulson appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court in June 2013, where he did not make a plea or declaration. He was later granted bail by Sheriff John McCormick.

Mr Coulson was the editor of the News of the World from 2003 to 2007 after taking over from Rebekah Brooks, who was acquitted of all the charges against her.

He went on to become the Conservative Party’s director of communications and moved into Downing Street when Mr Cameron became Prime Minister.

But Mr Cameron has welcomed the jail sentence handed down to his former friend. Speaking last week Mr Cameron said justice has been done.

The disgraced former editor was in the dock alongside Mulcaire, 43, and former news editors Greg Miskiw, 64, Neville Thurlbeck, 52, and James Weatherup, 58.

Thurlbeck and Miskiw were jailed for six months, while Mulcaire was given a six months suspended sentence and Weatherup a four month suspended sentence.
