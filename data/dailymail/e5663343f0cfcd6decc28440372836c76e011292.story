Getting a new tattoo isn't the obvious way to celebrate getting married but for one Swansea couple, getting inked proved to be the perfect way to remember their big day.

Paul James, 26, a leak technician, and his new wife Andrea Leahy-James, 28, a senior support assistant, popped out during their wedding last weekend to have 'I do' etched onto their ring fingers.

The tattoos were inked on at a nearby tattoo parlour called Everlasting Inc by tattooist Henry Todd and also included the date of their nuptials.

Andrea said: 'A tattoo is a bit more permanent and it is something we are always going to have.

'We have got "I do" and the date of the wedding as well so we never forget the date.'

Speaking during the tattooing process, she added: 'It's very surreal and painful but I wanted to do something quirky and different for our wedding photos.'

The wedding took place at St Paul's Church in Sketty and was followed by a reception for 96 guests in Norton House in Mumble. A further 80 guests were invited to join the couple to enjoy the evening celebration.

The newly married couple, who both had tattoos prior to their weddings, said the romantic etchings were the perfect way to celebrate.

Andrea added: 'Instead of going to Clyne Gardens [a beautiful botanical garden park in Swansea], we went to a tattoo parlour. Everything has gone perfectly.'

Talking about her tattoos, Andrea explained: 'I've only got a couple of little tattoos on my left wrist, my right ear and on my stomach, back and on my foot.

'Paul also has a tattoo sleeve on his left arm and a tattoo on his neck.'

And she revealed that this isn't the first time the couple have gotten tattoos declaring their love for one another.

'Paul has got one behind his right ear,' the happy bride added. 'It's an 'A' for Andrea and I have an 'A' for Andrea in the same place.'
