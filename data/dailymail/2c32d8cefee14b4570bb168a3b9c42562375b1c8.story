NAVY JUMPSUIT

£112, aqaq.com

Probably the most daring of all the outfits, this jumpsuit’s deep, square neckline shows more of my chest area than I’d usually expose on a beach in high summer. Yet I absolutely love it.

While it shows off plenty of cleavage, it reveals little else. The wide-legged all-in-one exudes 1970s glamour, plus it’s comfy. As it draws attention to only one place, make sure your cleavage is up to the task. I got some extra help from Wonderbra’s Ultimate Deep Plunge Bra (£32, very.co.uk).

Verdict: Daring and dramatic, but a big success.

RARE MAXI DRESS

£22.50, asos.com

Body necklace, £12, riverisland.com

The closest I’ll ever get to feeling like Jennifer Aniston, this shimmering gown exudes old-school Hollywood glamour, and the deep V-neck — accessorised with a body chain — inevitably draws the eye.

I have an average-sized 34B chest and, having had three children, my cleavage is not as perky as it was. But this plummeting neck creates an impressive embonpoint, accentuated by the gathered waist.

Verdict: A dress that will definitely put me in the spotlight, without leaving me over-exposed.

MISSGUIDED DRESS 

£30, missguided.co.uk

Shoes, £185, lucychoilondon.com

ON women of my age, this kind of clingy dress screams ‘cougar’. I’d have avoided a red, Lycra number like this even in my 20s. And it’s clearly not flattering now I’m in my 40s. However, the bodycon tube does create impressive cleavage. It’s tight enough to hold my boobs firmly in place, and the inbuilt cups give me a sculpted, full shape. 

Verdict: Undeniably  good cleavage — but I feel like I’ve gone out in my underwear!

LIPSY DRESS 

£50, lipsy.co.uk

Shoes, £198, lucychoilondon.com

This unusual dress will make you the centre of attention. Just not the right kind of attention. The old rule of thumb says you should never show boobs and legs at the same time: this breaks that rule.

There’s no doubt that it shows off my cleavage, but it exposes too much of everything else as well.

Verdict: A definite step too far.

BLUE MAXI DRESS

£55, asos.com

I feel like a Strictly Come Dancing reject. This gets top marks for flounce — yet in the chest department, it’s decidedly flat. I struggle through layers of chiffon and complicated straps, but it’s when I finally get the dress on that the work begins.

I spend ten minutes trying to get my boobs in place — each time, they slide into nothingness under folds of pleated fabric. In the end, I resort to strategically placed body tape to give my chest the uplift it needs. The result is underwhelming.

Verdict: Strictly to be avoided.
