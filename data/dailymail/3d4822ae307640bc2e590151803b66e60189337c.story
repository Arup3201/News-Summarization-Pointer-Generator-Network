A breathtaking image of the sun beginning to rise over the South Pacific Ocean has been captured by astronauts orbiting the Earth onboard the International space Station.

The incredible image was captured by one of the crew on the station as they passed a few hundred miles east of Easter Island.

It shows the brightness of the sun and the incredible blue of the atmosphere, and is the latest in a stunning series of pictures captured from the orbiting outpost.

The sun is about to come up over the South Pacific Ocean in this colorful scene photographed by one of the Expedition 35 crew members aboard the Earth-orbiting International Space Station

Nasa has not revealed which of the astronauts took the picture, which shows the sun about to come up over the South Pacific Ocean.

'In this 
colorful scene photographed by one of the Expedition 35 crew members 
aboard the Earth-orbiting International Space Station between 4 and 5 
a.m. local time, May 5, 2013, the outpost was at a point above Earth 
located at 27.4 degrees south latitude and 110.1 degrees west longitude,
a few hundred miles east of Easter Island,' Nasa said in a statement accompanying the picture.

 It is the latest in a stunning series of pictures captured by the current crop of astronauts aboard the orbiting outpost.

Although Nasa has not revealed who took the picture, Canadian Chris Hadfield who has gained a cult following on Twitter for his images of the Earth from space is thought to be a front-runner.

He is set to return to Earth later this month, and has tweeted a series of videos and pictures showing everything from how to cry in space to how astronauts cook.

A previous shot, which bears 
striking resemblance to the beginning of the opening credits of a 
Universal film, was posted last week.

The
image was shot over southwestern America and will be one of Hadfield's 
last tweets from space after he announced that his return to earth will 
commence later this month.

Commander of the International Space Station, Chris has gained an army of followers on Facebook and Twitter with his daily updates from space which feature beautiful pictures and news on the progress of the various missions he and his colleagues carry out.

Hadfield has been taking the Twitterverse by storm from aboard the ISS, which orbits the Earth at 8km a second, since he arrived back on December 21.

The collection of images he has posted from space feature locations as diverse as San Francisco's glittering lights and breathtaking cloud formations over Africa.

He has also captured large parts of the UK from space including Manchester, London and Bournemouth.

But his latest shot of the US at dawn is perhaps his best post yet.

The astronaut, who has also posted a variety of amusing videos showing what it is like to shave, vomit and brush your teeth in space, uses a long lens camera to capture the stunning detail of the Earth.

Among his favourite places to photograph is the Sahara in Africa and he explains that he waits until the sun is directly over the desert to get the best shot.

He says: 'The beauty of space station, though, is if it's not here this time, tomorrow it might be, or maybe a month from now.

'There's not a race to get a picture. You can be patient, like a hunter.'

He says that it’s not Instagram, it’s 'Space-a-gram' and that the key steps are: 'Focus, frame, and fire'.

He added: 'We orbit 400km above the earth, so if you want to get a good detailed picture of something you need a long lens. I have one velcroed to the wall.’

Chris uses a special setting on his camera to deal with the bright glare of light from the Earth against the pitch black backdrop of space.

He takes pictures in as high a resolution as possible, so his camera's memory card gets full very quickly.

The first Canadian to walk in space, Commander Hadfield, 53, a former air force fighter pilot, has previously flown two Space Shuttle missions in 1995 and 2001.

Hadfield has amassed 226,000 fans on Facebook and 740,000 followers on Twitter.

He announced that his 'fiery fall' to earth will commence on May 13 after the arrival of a new Russian commander.
