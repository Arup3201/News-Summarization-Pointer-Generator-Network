Locals in a small Pennsylvania town freed an elusive bear from a jar after it had been stuck on the young bruin's head for at least 11 days.

Using only a rope and a flashlight, four central Pennsylvania residents removed the plastic jar from the bear's head on Thursday night after going on a wild chase in the dark, according to the Associated Press and the Press Enterprise of Bloomsburg.

Area residents spotted the 100-pound brown bear—or bruin—on June 3 with a red jar on its head but game wardens failed to track him down. Rescuers said the bear was attracted to the jar because it seemed to once contain cooking oil.

'He put his head in, and had a problem,' said Mike Jurbala, 68, one of the members of the spontaneous rescue team. 'He'd have died in a couple more days.'

Jurbala saw the bear as he was leaving the bar at the Jamison City Hotel in Benton, Pa., and called Jeff Hubler, one of the game wardens who had been trying to capture the bear for several days with a lasso.

Hubler, a local employee of the State Game Comission, joined Jurbala and two other residents in capturing the bear. Along with Morgan Laskowski, 22, the hotel's bartender, and Jody Boyle, the bar's owner, Hubler and Jurbala followed the bear in the darkness.

'You knew where he was because you could hear him banging into things,' Jurbala said.

After the ragtag group cornered the bear in a backyard, the frightened bruin fell into the local resident's pool a couple of times, according to a report by the Press Enterprise.

After a while, the four wrangled the bear into a position where Hubler could safely pull off the jar.

'I thought, "No one is going to believe us,"' Laskowski said.

Boyle, Laskowski's mother, added the bear was stronger than it looked: 'You'd think the bear would be weak, because it hadn't eaten or drunk for a week, but it was strong.

This isn't the first time a bear has gotten in a sticky situation with a jar.

A tiny bear cub in Alaska got its head stuck in a plastic jug in March 2012. A hiker used an ice ax to cut through a plastic container that likely would have killed the 10-pound bear he found on Deer Mountain in Ketchikan, Alaska, according to the Anchorage Daily News.

'His future was pretty said and done,' the hiker, Michael Schuler, said of the cub. 'He wasn't going to move. He probably would have lain there until he died.'

In July 2010, a team with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission saved a six-month-old black bear cub in central Florida from a clear plastic container. The team had to tranquilize the cub's protective mother so they could save him, according to the New York Daily News.

'Although the story appears to have a happy ending,' the commission said of the incident. 'It truly illustrates one of the worst things that can happen when wildlife gets into garbage.'

Hubler, the Central Pennsylvanian game warden, made a note of saying people should keep lids on jars they toss.
