Mo Farah won his second gold medal of the week to become the most successful athlete in European Championship history on the best ever day for British athletes at major championships.

His 5,000m title was the second of five golds in one afternoon, together with two bronzes, to put Great Britain comfortably top of the medal table for only the third time in the 76-year history of this competition.

There were faint echoes of Super Saturday at the Olympic Stadium with Farah storming by the long jump pit en route to glory as Greg Rutherford prepared for his fourth leap, which eventually sealed gold. The household names did their job here.

The best: Mo Farah was joined on the podium by fellow Brit Andy Vernon, who took bronze in the 5,000m 

But it was Andy Vernon, a journeyman 28-year-old from Aldershot, who got Great Britain’s 20th medal of the Championships. Vernon, built like a middleweight boxer and partly funding his athletics career by babysitting, took bronze behind Farah, breaking the previous record of 19 medals, achieved in Barcelona in 2010.

Established members of the team have had curious but delightful breakthroughs this week. Jo Pavey, a 40-year-old mother of two, won her first major gold 25 years after her senior debut and Martyn Rooney, 27, finally fulfilled the promise he showed as a teenager by winning two titles here.

Rooney admitted he has been driven forward by the presence of talented 19-year-old Matt Hudson-Smith, who takes one gold and one silver back from Zurich to Wolverhampton.

‘It’s an incredible medal haul,’ said Rooney. ‘There are a lot of very talented young kids coming through and seeing that makes the older guys step up, so they have to fight for their place on the team. It’s a really cool team, too, one of my favourites to have been on.’

Other talented upstarts, such as sprinters Adam Gemili and Jodie Williams, have got their first taste of victory on the main stage, a point from which to push towards the World Championships next year and the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Farah, though, remains the most likely gold-medal prospect on the world stage. He might not be at his best but, in the watery afternoon sunshine at the Letzigrund Stadium, he achieved what no athlete has before — a triple-double of Olympic, world and European 5k and 10k titles.

‘History is important to me and it feels great to make my country proud,’ said Farah. His numerous entries in the record books are indelible but it is the personal moments that will live longest in the memory.

‘My twins (Aisha and Amani) are here,’ said Farah. ‘They are almost two now and it is the first time they’ve been old enough to properly watch me race. I got a kiss off them at the end. That means a lot.’

Farah has spoken recently of feeling vulnerable on the start line. He has collapsed twice this year — once at the end of the New York half-marathon and once again after a training run in Park City, Utah, which he said reminded him of the fragility of his career. But if he was feeling nervous, his rivals appeared petrified by his presence yesterday.

They knew they were up against a runner who is a class apart. The 31-year-old’s personal best of 12:53.11 is over 11 seconds quicker than next best, Jesus España of Spain.

 In the end Farah wrapped up victory in a pedestrian 14:05.82. He has not run as slowly since 2005, at the European Under 23 Championships.

Only Azerbaijani Hayle Ibrahimov took it to Farah, making a charge with 600m to go. Farah sailed past him and looked almost back to his best. ‘Next year will be interesting,’ he said, firing a thinly veiled warning shot in the direction of his East African rivals. Rutherford, meanwhile, joked he was ‘the biggest fluke going’, after taking his third major title in two years. It was a swipe at witless detractors who mock him for winning without breaking world records.

Rutherford, now the reigning Olympic, Commonwealth and European champion, jumped an impressive 8.29m in the fourth round, improving on his second-round effort of 8.27m.

‘I had the luxury of four rounds and leaving it,’ said Rutherford. ‘I had a slight tightening after the fourth and thought I’d wait and see if someone could jump further.’

Nobody did and the 27-year-old celebrated by sprinting down the track draped in the Union Jack.

Performance director Neil Black gave himself plenty of wriggle room before these championships, targeting a better finish than Helsinki in 2012 (seven in total, four gold) and worse than Barcelona in 2010 (19, six gold).

In the end they achieved their best haul of 23, with 12 gold, five silver and six bronze.

‘Yes, these are the European Championships, not global,’ said Black. ‘But there were still some seriously impressive results and we are top of Europe. It was an incredibly special Sunday.’
