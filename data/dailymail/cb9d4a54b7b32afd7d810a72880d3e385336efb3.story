Norwich defender Martin Olsson has been handed a further three-game ban by the Football Association after he admitted a charge of improper conduct.

The 26-year-old Sweden international appeared to push referee Simon Hooper when he was sent off during the 1-0 defeat by Wolves at Molineux on August 10.

The three-match ban is in addition to the one already served for the red card itself, which was the result of two bookings.

Olsson missed Saturday's 3-0 win over 10-man Watford at Carrow Road and, after the club confirmed they will not appeal the decision, he will also sit out Tuesday's visit of Blackburn, the trip to rivals Ipswich on Saturday and next Tuesday's home Capital One Cup second-round tie against Crawley.

An FA statement read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Norwich City's Martin Olsson has been suspended for three matches commencing with immediate effect, subject to any appeal.

'Olsson, who was also fined £3,000, admitted an FA misconduct charge in relation to an incident which occurred during the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday 10 August 2014.

'The charge was that Olsson's action in making physical contact with the Referee immediately prior to being shown a red card and for his behaviour as he left the field of play amounted to improper conduct, which occurred outside the jurisdiction of the Match Officials.'
