Good Samaritans have rescued an abandoned puppy after she was found covered in blood and left for dead in a tied-up trash bag.

Karen Herrera was walking through her neighborhood in Fontana, California two days before Thanksgiving when she heard whimpering in a nearby field.

She followed the sound to a trash bag and opened it to find a small puppy with patchy fur.

'She was scared and cold,' Herrera told KTLA. 'I patted her on the back of her spine and she was bleeding.'

Found: A puppy, named Gladys by her rescuers, is on the mend after being left for dead in a bag

Discovery: A passerby heard the dog whimpering and found her inside this tied-up trash bag in a field

Herrera called the police and another nearby resident wrapped the dog in a blanket as they waited for animal services to arrive, the Fontana Police Department said.

Animal Services Officers took the dog to an animal hospital and learned that the animal, who they named Gladys, was suffering from bite marks and Mange, a treatable skin disease. 

Gladys is now recovering at Sunshine Haven Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation, where staff say bites on her head suggests she was used as a victim dog used to train pit bulls for attacks. 

'When she came in, she was kind of depressed, she was this sad dog that doesn't move much,' Karolyn Vervill told KTLA.

Hero: Karen Herrera discovered the dog in the tied-up bag while on a walk two days before Thanksgiving

Scared: Herrera said that Gladys, pictured after she was found, was scared and had blood on her back

Treatment: She was taken to an animal hospital where staff found she was covered in bite marks and Mange

But she is going from strength-to-strength and making friends with the other dogs. 

She is expected to recover fully in the next few months and will be put up for adoption.  

Authorities do not know who dumped the dog but are appealing for anyone with information to call the Fontana Police Department anonymous hotline at 909-356-TIPS.

'It is a felony in California to subject any animal to unjustifiable suffering and neglect,' Fontana Animal Services Supervising Officer Jamie Simmons said.

'If you cannot afford veterinary care there are other options such as rescue groups, local shelters, or humane euthanasia through a licensed veterinarian to prevent its suffering.'  

Sad: When she first arrived at the rescue center, staff noticed that she seemed depressed and withdrawn 

Improving: A before (left) and after (right) shot shows how the puppy's skin is improving since she was found

Care: Gladys is now improving and will be put up for adoption when she has recovered in a few months
