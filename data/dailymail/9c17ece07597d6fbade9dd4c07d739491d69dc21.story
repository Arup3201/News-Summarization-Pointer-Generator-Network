Plans to hand MPs an inflation-busting 11 per cent pay rise sparked a civil war in Westminster last night, with ministers and backbenchers at loggerheads over whether to pocket the cash.

The Cabinet, Labour frontbenchers and Lib Dem ministers are all set to reject plans by an independent watchdog to raise their basic salary from £66,396 to £74,000 – nearly three times the average wage – from 2015.

Senior figures in all three parties branded the proposals ‘preposterous’, ‘unthinkable’ and ‘wholly inappropriate’ at a time of public sector  pay freezes. Many are expected to hand the extra cash to charity.

Tension: David Cameron is among a group opposing Ipsa's suggestion to increase MPs salaries to almost triple the average wage. But Jack Straw (right) says it is needed to encourage people from modest backgrounds

But backbench MPs reacted with anger at the calls for restraint, arguing that they deserve pay rises.

And Tory MPs privately said they would frown on calls for restraint from ‘millionaires in the Cabinet’ who have their own private wealth to fall back on.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which was charged with setting MPs’ pay after the expenses scandal, will announce the pay rise on Thursday. MPs can no longer vote to block it.

In return for the extra cash, MPs will have to make higher pension contributions, bringing them in line with the rest of the public sector. 

They will see their expenses claims for dinner, taxis and tea and biscuits slashed.

And in future, MPs who walk away from Parliament will be denied lucrative golden goodbye payments, which will be claimed only by those who are defeated at the polls.

During Ipsa’s consultation process over the summer, 69 per cent of MPs, questioned anonymously, said they deserved a pay rise. On average, they judged they were worth £86,000 a year. One in five wanted more than £95,000.

Against: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told Andrew Marr he will not take the money

Also unhappy: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have also blasted the figure

David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband all told Ipsa to change its plans. But it has ignored the complaints and said MPs need the extra money as they have fallen behind comparable jobs in the civil service and local government.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show he would not take the money – a view echoed by aides to Mr Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable.

Mr Alexander said: ‘I think it would be wholly inappropriate for MPs to get such a large pay rise at a time when every other public sector worker sees their pay rises capped at 1 per cent.’

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘This is not the moment’ for a big pay rise.’

David Cameron is expected to say on Thursday that the Cabinet will hand the pay rise to charities and other good causes. Labour sources said the shadow cabinet is likely to give away the extra money.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Ipsa appeared to have come to its conclusions ‘entirely out of any context of the real world’.

Several MPs including shadow health 
secretary Andy Burnham and Lib Dem pensions minister  Steve Webb said 
they would forego the pay rise.

The clash has divided parliament as some MPs claim they wont take it and others say they need it

But a handful publicly defended the move. Former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw warned that failing to pay MPs more would damage the diversity of the Commons.

‘You will go on recruiting people of some talent who have family money or who have got many fewer family responsibilities but you won’t get, importantly, recruitment from people of modest backgrounds.’

Tory MP David Ruffley said: ‘It is an inconvenient truth that MPs’ pay has fallen behind other equivalent occupations for some years, such as the judiciary.’

But there was also anger that Cabinet ministers like Mr Hammond, who earns £134,000 a year and made millions from business, are expected to call on MPs not to take their pay rise.

One Tory MP said: ‘It’s easy for ministers to tell the rest of us not to take the money when some of them are paid more than twice what backbenchers get.’ 

Sources close to Ipsa said the package would be cost-neutral, with pensions cuts paying for the higher salary.

But short of passing a law to abolish Ipsa, it won’t be possible to hand back the money. One insider stressed: ‘They’ll get the money. What they choose to do with it is a matter for them.’
