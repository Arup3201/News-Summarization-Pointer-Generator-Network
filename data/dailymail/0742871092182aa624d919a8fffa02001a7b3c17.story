A photographer has told of his shock after a conman stole one of his prized images which he used to win first place in an international competition.

Talented Hengki Koentjoro had painstakingly created a beautiful black and white image of a motorcyclist riding through the fog next to a forest, which he had posted on several photographic websites. 

But it was shamelessly stolen by Instagram
 member ‘bogdhan', who flipped it horizontally, put it through one of 
the website's filters and then entered it into Samsung's ‘Live in the 
moment' competition.

The thief was awarded first place and was almost sent a prize of a £500 digital camera before the competition organisers were alerted to his scam.

Mr Koentjoro, a fine-art photographer from Indonesia, had been tipped off about the theft by a friend about a month later and had contacted Samsung just before the prize was sent out.

Incredibly the photograph was still 
posted on 'bogdhan's' Instagram page this week where it has attracted a 
flood of angry comments.

dealt with copycats before I can only begin to try to express the upset 
that this causes, when you work so hard for something only for someone 
to swoop in and take the credit.

'I
 don't understand how you can not feel shame? surely coming first place 
with your own content would be a much better feeling of pride than what 
you have done.

'Its shameful and pure greed. its disrespectful to creativity too to try and rip someone off for your own personal gain.'

Incredibly boghan used his instagram page to criticise Mr Koentjoro, suggesting he was only trying to get his hands on a prize which he didn't deserve.

Addressing his many critics he wrote: 'I suggest you all nicely to stop harassing me with such 
comments and mind your own business.

'I read the rules before I 
participate and I'm very aware that it was respected. So stop being some
 guy kissass'ers in order for him to claim a prize that he doesn't 
deserve.'

Samsung later contacted Mr Koentjoro saying: ‘Thank you for alerting us in regard to this issue. We take copyright infringement very seriously and it is very unfortunate that [the] present case has taken place.

Shameless: The doctored image remains on Bogdhan's Instagram page where it has attracted a flurry of angry comments

‘We have disqualified the applicant of this picture, and he is no longer the winner of the contest – neither will he receive the prize.'

The competition, which was organised at Samsung's headquarters in South Korea, allowed entrants to submit photos via Facebook and Instagram.

They offered a prize of an NX300 camera to the four category winners.

Speaking yesterday to Amateur Photographer magazine, which has published his work in the past, Mr Koentjoro called for more education about photographic copyright among the general public.

He said: ‘Let's warn other photographers to be careful with their work.'
