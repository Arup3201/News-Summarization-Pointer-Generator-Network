The uncle of top Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard is being hunted by police in connection with a an international drug smuggling ring.

Robert Stephen Gerrard, 50, is wanted following a raid by armed officers on a Rotterdam cafe, believed to be an operations centre for international drug traffickers.

He is the second cousin of the Anfield icon, although he is known as 'Uncle Bobby'.

Tuesday’s raid was part of a series of coordinated strikes in the UK and the Netherlands involving officers from the National Crime Agency and the Dutch National Crime Squad.

Two Turkish brothers suspected of running the operations centre were among ten men arrested in the Netherlands.

Three men were arrested in the UK – a 64-year-old from Hale, Greater Manchester, a 36-year-old from Harlow, Essex, and a 47-year-old from Brentwood, Essex. Addresses in Liverpool linked to Gerrard and another man, Michael Paul Moogan, 27, were also searched.

Investigators believe the café, which can only be entered via a buzzer system, is used by criminals from across the world as a meeting place for negotiations with cartels and for arranging the bankrolling and shipping of huge quantities of drugs.

Officers recovered two handguns, over 100 mobile phones, 300,000 Euros, a cash counting machine, a radio scanner, a radio jammer and high value watches from the café. At other addresses in Rotterdam officers seized nine handguns, two semi-automatic rifles, a cocaine press and a total of 200,000 Euros.

There is no suggestion Steven Gerrard currently has any connection to Robert Gerrard.

Steve Baldwin, Regional Head of Investigations for the NCA, said: 'We believe this café was being used as a front for a drug trafficking operations centre with international reach.

'This was a well established set up which was open 18 hours a day. It appears you were only allowed in if your face was known. Taking it out of operation will have caused serious disruption to the activities of organised crime groups across the world.

'We suspect those arrested in the UK and the two men we are now seeking - Gerrard and Moogan - have used the café to orchestrate the importation of large quantities of drugs to the UK. If anyone has information on their whereabouts I would urge them to contact us.'

The 64-year-old from Hale, Greater 
Manchester, was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine – up to 80 
kilos a month since April.

Gerrard and Moogan are wanted in connection with the same conspiracy.

The two men from Essex, who are linked to a separate NCA operation, have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

It is not the first time links between Steven Gerrard and Liverpool's gangsters have arisen.

The Gerrards, it must be stated here, are a law-abiding family without a stain on their character.

In 2008 Gerrard appeared as a character witness to John Kinsella, a known gangster charged with tying up a security guard during a £41,000 robbery.

Gerrard and his father, Paul, were happy to vouch for the defendant's character in an open letter to the court.

Kinsella, the jury heard, had earned their gratitude by persuading a notorious criminal, George Bromley Junior, to call off a campaign of intimidation and extortion against the footballer.

Signed by Paul Gerrard, it detailed how Kinsella, an amateur boxer and martial arts expert, saved Steven from a young gangster who threatened to shoot him in the legs in a dispute over a girlfriend.

'We were at our wits' end when we were introduced by a family friend to John Kinsella,' the letter concluded.

'From that time we have never had any more problems from the Liverpool underworld.'

In 2003, the father of one of his ex-girlfriends, with whom Steven is said to have been close, was given a lengthy jail term for possessing 5,000 ecstasy tablets and a gun.

Further, Gerrard's wife, Alex (nee Curran), used to date a well-known Liverpudlian criminal by the name of Tony Richardson.

Even his stellar football career is alleged to have fallen prey to the villains.

Four years ago, Gerrard's multi-million pound transfer to Chelsea was called off at the eleventh hour because of intolerable pressure being placed on his family by 'certain elements', a source told the Daily Mail in 2008.

The precise reasons why this remarkable U-turn came about remain shrouded in mystery.

However, it is known that, at the time, a number of leading gangland figures in Liverpool were determined that their football club's prize asset should not be lost to the city - at any cost.

Steven Gerrard's representatives were not available for comment.

The NCA is now working closely with 
Merseyside Police to locate Robert Gerrard and Michael Moogan. Anyone with information on their 
whereabouts should contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or the NCA on 0370 496 7622.
