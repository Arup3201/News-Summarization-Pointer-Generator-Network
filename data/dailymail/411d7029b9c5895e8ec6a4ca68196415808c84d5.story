George North has been warned he could put his career in jeopardy if he plays again this season after suffering a third confirmed concussion in the space of four months.

The Northampton and Wales winger, who sustained two head injuries against England in February but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents, was knocked unconscious again on Friday night in Saints' Aviva Premiership win over Wasps.

Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder indicated after the game that the 22-year-old could still be considered for next Saturday's European Champions Cup clash with Clermont, but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season. 'George needs to be given an extended rest period to figure out if this is something that he has just not recovered from or whether there are genuine issues,' World Rugby concussion advisor Professor Willie Stewart said.

'I think he personally needs to say, 'No, I'm not playing again this season'. If he does play again too soon it could be the end of his World Cup or even his career.

'The people looking after him, including Northampton and the Welsh Rugby Union, should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out.

'No-one should be talking about playing him next week. That's just ridiculous. I know at this time of year we're getting into the thick of it for trophies and championships but it's also getting into the sharp end for George's brain.

'I would be surprised if he makes another appearance.

'The people who are minding him and looking after his career should be saying to him that in World Cup year, even if he feels 100 per cent better in six weeks, it is not worth risking his chance on the highest stage.'

North missed Wales' win over South Africa last autumn after being concussed against New Zealand and was given three weeks off in February after the outcry over the way his double head knock against England was handled.

A Northampton statement read: 'After the game George North was conscious and in the Saints' changing room with the rest of the team. He has been into the club for treatment and will continue to be monitored by the Saints' experienced medical team throughout the weekend.

'As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints places the highest importance on player welfare, and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.'

England full back Mike Brown, rested for a month during the Six Nations after being knocked out against Italy on February 14, missed Harlequins' Wembley clash with Saracens after experiencing further concussion-related symptoms in recent days.

Earlier this week former Wales international Jonathan Davies said he feared for Leigh Halfpenny's career if the full back did not improve a tackling technique that contributed to him being concussed in his side's final Six Nations win over Italy.

The North and Brown cases have again raised questions over rugby's return-to-play protocols, which can permit concussed players to play again within six days if they are shown to be symptom free.

In professional boxing, a sport with a concussion rate comparable to professional rugby's, any fighter who loses consciousness for less than a minute faces a mandatory 90 day stand down. A loss of consciousness of more than a minute leads to an enforced 180 day rest period.

North was also knocked out twice during Wales' Six Nations defeat by England earlier this year

The winger played on that day but missed the next match as Wales medics were criticised for their decision
