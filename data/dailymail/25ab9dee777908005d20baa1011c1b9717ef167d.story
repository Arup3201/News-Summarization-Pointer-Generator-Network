Juventus are due to hold talks with Arturo Vidal and his representatives over where his future lies but it is unlikely to be at Manchester United.

The 27-year-old stated last week that he would not be going to Manchester and that was echoed by director general Beppe Marotta.

More pertinently United have not opened talks with Juventus over a deal for the Chile international.

Money talks: Juventus don't want to let Arturo Vidal go but will find it hard to refuse a high price

Asset: Although linked to Old Trafford, there haven't been talks with Juventus about signing Vidal

Juventus have financial difficulties and need to raise funds and, despite claims that they want Vidal to stay along with Paul Pogba, there are suspicions they would welcome substantial offers.

United though are looking elsewhere with Louis van Gaal confirming an interest in Roma's Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman while talks are ongoing over a possible deal for Thomas Vermaelen at Arsenal.

Edinson Cavani has again been proposed to United after productive talks were held in February and March.

The Uruguay striker has been left out of PSG's pre-season tour to Hong Kong officially owing to a virus. The 27-year-old was receptive to joining United when David Moyes was manager and regardless of their qualification for the Champions League.

Talks had been hindered slightly by his change of agent.

United's players meanwhile have reported back favourably about Van Gaal's training so far. Even those who have suffered a rebuke, remark that he has been fair.

There are however likely departures. Javier Hernandez has yet to be fully assessed by Van Gaal but he is a target for several clubs home and abroad with Inter Milan in particular going back and forth on their wishlist.

They are due to hold talks with Southampton about Dani Osvaldo on Tuesday but Hernandez is still in their thoughts.

United midfielder Davide Petrucci, meanwhile, is wanted on loan by League One Sheffield United.

The 22-year-old Italian was one of a number of young United players left behind from the tour of the USA.

Seagulls ramp up move for Stockdale

Brighton manager Sami Hyypia is stepping up his pursuit of Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale.

Sportsmail reported Brighton's interest in the 28-year-old earlier this month and Hyypia wants to close a deal to give his side a stronger foundation for promotion next season.

Talks are advancing as of Monday and Fulham are looking for more than the initial £1million that was proposed.

Highly regarded: Fulham's David Stockdale is a target for Sami Hyypia at Championship rivals Brighton

Stockdale, despite his undoubted talents, has made only 39 appearances for Fulham since arriving from Darlington in 2008 and has been out on loan six times.

He has had to compete with Mark Schwarzer and Maarten Stekelenburg but was still seen as a reliable component of Fulham's squad.

The sale to Championship rivals will raise eyebrows among some at Craven Cottage but Brighton manager Hyypia is eager to make a breakthrough in his search for new recruits.

He is also maintaining an interest in Manchester United's Jesse Lingaard but will have to wait until mid-August for a decision on a loan.

Spurs want Lopes as right-back cover

Tottenham are holding talks with representatives of Miguel Lopes on Tuesday. The Sporting Lisbon right-back was on loan at Lyon last season and will be allowed to leave.

Tottenham want cover at right-back with Kyle Naughton expected to follow Gylfi Sigurdsson to Swansea.

Kyle Walker is getting back to full fitness but Tottenham want quality competition also for the 24-year-old.

Lopes can play left-back also to add to his versatility but Tottenham are planning a new contract for Danny Rose to go with the arrival of Ben Davies.

Tottenham lost out to Atletico Madrid for Antoine Griezmann but had not pushed too hard for the deal and maintain a passing interest in PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay and Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar.

They have yet to firm up interest in Wilfried Bony and have no plan to move for Loic Remy. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin remains a priority.

Off to Rome: Holland defender Stefan de Vrij was linked to Man United but Lazio will land him instead

De Vrij move to Lazio imminent

Lazio expect to sign Stefan de Vrij in the next 48 hours.

The 22-year-old Holland international has been linked with Manchester United consistently throughout the summer while Southampton and Borussia Dortmund have shown an interest in the Feyenoord centre-back also.

However, Lazio have been the constant presence and their bid of £6.7million looks like being successful as he heads to Italy tomorrow for further talks over a five year contract and an expected medical.

Feyenoord remain interested in signing Manchester City striker John Guidetti. The Swede is also in the thinking of Ronald Koeman at Southampton who will press on this week with his rebuilding.

Celtic's Fraser Forster and centre-back Virgil Van Dijk are targets although there are reservations about Van Dijk's pace for the Premier League.

Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar is a target but not easy to do with Paul Lambert keen to keep him.

Villa and Baggies vie for Moses loan

Aston Villa will rival neighbours West Bromwich Albion in a bid to take Victor Moses on loan.

Paul Lambert has an interest in Chelsea's Christian Atsu also but Moses represents a ready-made Premier League player.

Although his loan spell at Liverpool failed to inspire last season, the 23-year-old is eager to make amends and would benefit from greater time on the pitch which Liverpool did not afford him.

Villa have Charles N'Zogbia returning from injury who played alongside Moses at Wigan while Lambert will revive his move for Swansea midfielder Ki Sung Yeung also this week.

Notts talk to former United keeper Carroll 

Former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll is talking over a proposed deal to join Notts County.

The tough Northern Ireland goalkeeper is 36 now and a free agent after leaving Greek side Olympiakos.

Strong presence: After appearing in a friendly for Notts County, Roy Carroll is in talks with the club about a deal

He played for Notts in their friendly defeat to Halifax Town on Saturday.

Manager Shaun Derry said: 'He is the type of keeper I am looking for. He's a man. I heard him talking to the back four and he's got a great mentality.

'He didn't have much chance with the goal, but he commanded his box well and that's what you get with a goalkeeper of his experience.'
