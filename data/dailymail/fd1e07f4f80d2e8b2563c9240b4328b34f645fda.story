To many New Yorker's satisfaction, one Supreme Court justice thinks that while Chicago deep dish is 'very tasty,' it doesn't count as pizza.

Antonin Scalia spoke to an audience at the Union League Club in Chicago for George Washington's birthday and gave his opinion on the New York pizza versus the Chicago pizza controversy.

US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia thinks deep dish pizza should be called 'tomato pie'

Scalia believes real pizza like New York pizza (left) has a thin crust while Chicago pizza (right) has a thick crust and should be called 'tomato pie'

The International Business Times reports that this isn't the first time Scalia has spoken out about his favoritism for New York pizza.

In 2011, Scalia argued that thin-crust New York pizza is 'infinitely better' than deep dish.

He spoke with students at the Chicago Kent School of law and told them, 'I do indeed like so-called "deep dish pizza"... Itâ€™s very tasty...But it should not be called pizza It should be called 'a tomato pie.' Real pizza is Neapolitan. It is thin. It is chewy and crispy, OK?'

Even though Scalia's opinion on the pizza is not an official ruling, Scalia has some background experience in the matter.

The New York Post reports that Scalia was born in New Jersey then grew up in Elmhurst, Queens where he was raised eating New York pizza.

Pizza originates in Italy, and since Scalia is the son of an Italian immigrant it make sense that he has an opinion about the popular dish,

Scalia is one of the more conservative Supreme Court justices and is known for being a textualist, someone who relies very heavily on what the constitution says instead of what makes the most sense for the common law of the time period.

Even though many believe that thin crust pizza evolved over time into its Chicago deep dish counter part, Scalia stands by his original belief that , 'Real pizza is Neapolitan. It is thin. It is chewy and crispy, OK?'

Scalia's penchant for New York thin crust pizza may be due to the fact he is both Italian an was raised in Queens, New York
