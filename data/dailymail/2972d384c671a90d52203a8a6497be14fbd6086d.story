The victim of a devastating flesh-eating disease will return home after a spell of intense rehabilitation to a house completely redesigned to aid her recovery.

Student Aimee Copeland, 24, who lost her left leg, right foot and hands after contracting necrotizing fasciitis after a zip line accident, will live in her very own wing.

The 1,800 sq ft two-storey addition to her childhood Snellville, Georgia, home will have a bedroom, fitness room, sunroom and study, where she can work on her master's degree.

Happy: After nearly two months of battling the rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis, Copeland was all smiles as she finally left the hospital after having four limbs amputated

An elevator will allow her to go wherever she wants - and it's all being built by volunteers touched by her sad story.

Her father Andy said: 'Right now our house is not Aimee-friendly because it's very small and compact. We're going to add an Aimee wing.'

'While she's getting better, we need to have this house prepared so she has a good viable home to come to.'

Aimee was released from Doctors Hospital in August on Monday, two months after she cut open her calf in the accident.

She will undergo rehab at an inpatient facility over the next six weeks, where she will learn to use a wheelchair and her prosthetic limbs.

Dr Alberto Esquenazi, chief medical officer of MossRehab in Philadelphia, said of her long road to recovery: 'The first step is to provide patients with self independence.

'She has the advantage that she's a young woman, and from what I understand a very determined young woman. She also appears to have a very supportive environment, between her family, her friends and her community.'

That is evident by the fact that a local architect volunteered to design the space and several other community members signed on to build it.

Casey Moon, a general and renovation contractor, is just one person to offer support for the worthwhile project.

He said: 'How can you not want to help? I've always been that way. I was raised that way. My family raised me to help and that's what I truly try to do.'

Josh Silvers, who is also pitching in, added: 'I have kids of my own, and it's just touches everybody's heart and you want to come out and help.'

And Garrett Nordille, another volunteer, said: 'I'm just out here to help. I have two children of my own and can only imagine something like this happening. I wanted to stop here and help them out.'

Recovery: Aimee's mother said her daughter was motivated to go and get her rehab started as soon as possible and they hopes the clinic could also do something about the pain she is in

Copeland's parents spoke on Monday to the Today show and revealed how their daughter is determined to walk for her graduation in December.

Her father Andy said: 'It's amazing the things we take for granted, like the ability to get up and go fix a cup of coffee and sit back down again.

'She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her. She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.'

Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital earlier this week smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll.

She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance.

Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.'

Aimee recently revealed to her parents she wants to be able to walk again for her graduation in December.

Asked whether or not they think that is possible, Mr Copeland said: 'I believe in the power of prayer, and she is a very prayerful young lady.

'With that behind us coupled with her determination and her resolute will, I believe anything is possible.

'I think we all deal with the emotional aspect every day and I think that's where the family unit comes together as we support each other and she'll continue to need our support.

'That's why it is good she is local and she told us she wants to see us every day. There is nothing more important to us right now than the health and well-being of our daughter.

'She continues to recover and we want to continue to be there for her and I believe our presence will be a mitigated factor in her recovery.'

Aimee will spend the next six to eight weeks in a rehabilitation clinic learning to move with the aid of a wheelchair after having her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated.

Copeland's speedy recovery has defied 
doctors' initial prognosis. Her father says they at first gave her just a
slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a 
respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace 
infected skin

Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital.

'I think you could say that she's looking forward to it to the same degree that a child would look forward to leaving high school and going off to college, for her this is a major milestone.

'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have.

'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do.

'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.'

Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso

She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain
is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".'

The
University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life 
after the small cut to her leg became infected.

The bacteria that attacked her wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer
of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Aimee has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

Mr
Copeland wrote that support Aimee has come from all over the US, including from celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and 
Ann Curry.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months.

'This
doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
amazed.'
