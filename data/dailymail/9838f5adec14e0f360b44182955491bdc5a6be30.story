Southampton’s extraordinary start to the season, maintained with a brilliant opportunist’s goal from Victor Wanyama at the KC Stadium, has been built on the best defensive record in the country.

The Saints have kept six clean sheets in 10 Premier League matches and conceded just five goals, two of them at Liverpool in the first match Ronald Koeman’s side played together.

Nathaniel Clyne is a key component of the division’s best back line and the 23-year-old right-back sees no reason why this dream season cannot continue — for club and country.

Nathaniel Clyne has been in impressive form for high-flying Southampton so far this season

Victor Wanyama's first-time effort from 40 yards out gave Southampton an early lead at the KC Stadium

‘I think I’ve got the ability to play for my country. Hopefully I can get the call-up next time,’ he said.

England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands as Clyne gave another fine attacking full-back display at the KC Stadium.

Southampton's five goals conceded is half the next lowest number in the Premier League, and the lowest per game in all of English football.

He was an unused substitute in the last squad and hopes for another call-up ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on November 15.

Last time, I did. Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap.’

‘This has been the best season of his career to date. I feel fit, I feel strong, I’m getting a lot of game time and I’m enjoying it.’

Another Englishman, Ryan Bertrand, has been a star performer for the Saints this season

Southampton have another English full-back on the opposite flank in Ryan Bertrand, and an England goalkeeper in Fraser Forster.

With centre-halves Toby Alderweireld and Jose Fonte and defensive midfielders Wanyama (left) and Morgan Schneiderlin, Koeman has constructed a sturdy platform on which his flair players have freedom to operate.

‘We work hard on our defensive shape in training and it shows during games,’ Clyne said. ‘They only had one shot at goal.

‘It’s good and hopefully it continues. If you keep a clean sheet, you’ve always got a chance of winning a game or getting a result that we need.’

Hull’s manager, Steve Bruce, joined the chorus of praise for Southampton, saying it was refreshing to see them riding high. ‘Let’s hope they stay there. There’s no reason they can’t, if they can stay injury-free. To be fair to everyone at Southampton, they can take a big pat on the back.’
