A Dubai-based British motorcyclist has died following an accident at an international cross-country rally, the organisers of the event have said.

Cameron Waugh died in hospital after the accident at the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge.

He was found by fellow rider Jakub Przygonski, from Poland, who set off the satellite alarm and performed cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.

Two doctors and a paramedic arrived at the scene by helicopter within 13 minutes, and Mr Waugh was immediately transferred to hospital. He was later pronounced dead, a statement on the event's website said.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of the Automobile and Touring Club of the UAE (ATCUAE), the rally organisers, said: 'I am deeply shocked and saddened by the news, and on behalf of the ATCUAE and everyone connected with the event, I send our sincere condolences to Cameron's family.

'He was one of our regular competitors, and a very likeable and popular one who loved the sport, and we have lost one of our own today.

'Safety is always our top priority, and the highly motivated professionals in our Search and Rescue and medical teams who responded to today's accident did everything within their power. Our thoughts are with Cameron's family.'

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of reports and are looking into them.'

Sulayem also paid tribute to Jakub Przygonski. He said: 'Jakub performed CPR to the point of exhaustion, and was heroic in the way he tried to save a fellow competitor.'

'A lot of other riders stopped at the scene of the accident and made the area safe, and assisted the medical team. We are very grateful to them all.'

The website for the event says the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge is 'a five-day motor sport spectacular' being staged in its entirety across Abu Dhabi emirate.

It says the event is 'expected to further strengthen Abu Dhabi's credentials as a tourism destination of distinction and major sporting events hub'.

The event began on April 3 and will finish on April 10.
