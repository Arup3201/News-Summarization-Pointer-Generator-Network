Al Gore has decided to follow his former political partner's lead and has switched to a vegan diet.

The former Vice President has expressed and investment interest in a food start up that is trying to develop a plant-based mayonnaise in an effort to cut down American's dependence on eggs.

In a Forbes article about the eco-friendly company, Hampton Creek, it is revealed that Gore is a 'newly turned vegan'.

No more meat products: Former Vice President Al Gore has recently switched to a vegan diet, meaning that he does not eat any animal products and only plants-based food (seen here in October of this year)

Fluctuation: Al Gore's weight has changed dramatically immediately after he lost the 2000 election as many thought he was depressed (seen at left during the campaign, and at right less than a year later)

The switch doesn't come as a massive surprise considering his weight has fluctuated over the years and recently admitted that he was trying to be healthier.

During an interview with New York Magazine in May of this year, he was described as serving himself a vegetable soup and salad followed by a fruit salad for dessert.

'I have been eating more healthfully. I’ve been trying to get in much better shape, and I’ve enjoyed that,' he told the magazine.

The switch to a completely animal-free diet does show a shift in ideology, at least on the personal level, for the politician-turned-environmental advocate.

Gore has dedicated much of his career following the presidential defeat in 2000 to working against climate change and global warming, but he came under fire from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for not pushing for vegetarianism- or even being fully vegetarian himself.

'I'm not a vegetarian, but I have cut back sharply on the meat that I eat,' he said in 2009.

Back in the day: Clinton and Gore, seen during their first bid for the White House in 1992, were noticeably heavier in their younger years and were omnivores on the campaign trail

Setting a good example: Their kick into health awareness started while in office, as then-First Lady Hillary Clinton imposed healthier options at the White House mess (seen jogging during the 1992 campaign)

'I've made those changes, and while I don't go quite as far as... saying everybody should become a vegetarian... it is a legitimate point of view.'

Gore's former running mate Bill Clinton made a very public switch to a vegetable-heavy diet after a number of heart problems including quadruple bypass in 2004 and the implementation of two stents in 2010.

While the former president has said that he considers himself a vegan since he largely abides by the plant-based diet, he did also reveal to the AARP that he has a serving of salmon or eggs once every week in order to get sufficient protein and iron.

Changes: Clinton, who has had multiple heart scares, said that he changed his diet so he could live to see his grandchildren. He lost 30 pounds before Chelsea's wedding (seen together in 1995 at left and in July at right)

Clinton has credited his improved health and dramatic weight loss- he is said to have lost 30 pounds in the months leading up to his daughter Chelsea's wedding- to the 'vegan' diet.

'It's just a good thing to do, it will be healthier for you and you put less stress on your cardiovascular system,' Clinton told fellow-vegan Ellen DeGeneres on her talks show in May of last year.

While his fish and egg exceptions would still qualify him as a vegetarian, he does have one major cheat break coming up: he told CNN's Sanjay Gupta that in 2010 he broke all the rules and had turkey on Thanksgiving- but only one bite.
