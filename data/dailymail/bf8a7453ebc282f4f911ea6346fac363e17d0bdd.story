Their bitter spat over Britain joining the euro led Tony Blair to describe Gordon Brown as ‘crackerjack’, it emerged yesterday.

The then Prime Minister regarded his Chancellor – and rival – as ‘brilliant’ but ‘bonkers’, according to former Labour spin-doctor Alastair Campbell.

In the latest extracts from his diaries, covering 2001 to 2003, Mr Campbell said distrust and loathing between the pair  plummeted to the point where Downing Street believed Mr Brown was ‘hell-bent’ on the Prime Minister’s destruction.

At loggerheads: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair thought his successor Gordon Brown was 'bonkers' and a 'malign force' that was 'hell-bent' on his destruction, according to the latest extracts from Alastair Campbell's diaries

Many of their arguments centred on Britain joining the single currency.

A 2003 entry records pro-euro Mr Blair
saying after an acrimonious meeting with Mr Brown: ‘One thing is for 
sure. At the moment he is crackerjack.’

In June that year, the Chancellor 
announced that Britain had not passed the five tests he had set to 
assess whether Britain should join the euro.

The following day Mr Campbell asked the Prime Minister how long it would take to remove the obstacles to the euro.

Mr Blair replied: ‘The best way would be to get out a gun, shoot the obstacle and then have a reshuffle.

‘[TB] was no longer in any doubt that 
GB was still slowing it down deliberately. [Mr Blair said]: “It’s the 
dead hand, the paralysis of progress.” Then a chat with [TB] and GB on 
the euro. You could tell from his confident body language that GB was 
where he wanted to be.’

The latest extracts from Mr Campbell's Downing Street diaries shine a light on the tension and bitterness behind the scenes during Mr Blair's decade in office

An entry 24 hours later said: ‘Things 
just hadn’t worked on the euro and TB was pretty fed up... the judgment 
was settling that GB had basically thwarted him.’

In the fourth, and final, volume of 
his Downing Street diaries, Mr Campbell reveals more details of 
relentless feuds between the two men at the heart of the last Labour 
government. In an entry for September 2002, Mr Campbell said Mr Blair 
felt a ‘dark cloud of GB (Gordon Brown) over him’ the whole time. ‘[TB] 
said GB was getting desperate and now was acting as a destructive 
force.’

Mr Campbell, the Number 10 director of
communications, and the inspiration behind the claim in 1998 that Mr 
Brown had ‘psychological flaws’, said Mr Blair told him: ‘He’s brilliant
and ambitious but he’s also bonkers and I just can’t be bothered with 
it.’

The extracts also indicate Mr Campbell
suspected the Chancellor and his aides of briefing against the Prime 
Minister, contradicting evidence Mr Brown gave to the Leveson Inquiry 
last week when he denied plotting against Mr Blair.

In November 2002 relations between Mr 
Blair and Mr Brown, who succeeded him in 2007, sank further, with Mr 
Campbell writing: ‘TB said if people knew the truth about how GB treats 
him, they would be appalled. He felt GB was trying to push him into 
trying to get rid of him, and he would then seek to mount a challenge.’

Four days later: ‘I think the general 
feeling now, not just in Number 10 but around the cabinet table too, was
that GB was pretty hell-bent on TB’s destruction.’ Later that month: 
‘TB said he now accepted GB was a largely malign force.’

In January 2003, when Mr Campbell 
asked the Prime Minister what he was going to do about his ‘friend next 
door’, Mr Blair said: ‘I’m going to sack him. The next month, after a 
meeting with Mr Brown and Ed Balls on the euro, Mr Blair said the 
situation ‘was the worst yet’. The diary reads: ‘[TB] said GB talked to 
him like he was a five-year-old.’

On April 4, after another angry 
meeting between the pair on the euro, the Downing St spin doctor wrote: 
‘TB and I went out on the terrace later. “One thing is sure,” he said. 
“At the moment he is crackerjack. My big worry is he will bring the 
whole show down.” ’

The following month: ‘He said he and 
GB were in a different league to the rest of the Cabinet... GB was the 
only one who got anywhere near him in terms of ability, which was why he
still felt he had to be next. But he couldn’t see a way out.

‘He felt if they fell out terminally, and he felt he had to get rid of him, that was the nuclear option.’
