An 11-year-old boy has been eaten by a four-metre crocodile in Papua New Guinea while fishing with his parents.

Melas Mero's hands, legs and one hipbone were found inside the reptile and his head was discovered nearby.

He was enjoying a family day out on Thursday at the Siloura River in Gulf Province, in the south of the country, when the horrific attack happened.

Police commander Lincoln Gerari told PNG's National newspaper: 'The crocodile swept the boy with its tail and then attacked the defenceless child.'

Police discovered the child's limbs after they managed to track down the beast and kill it.

They later found his head and took it to a morgue.

Earlier this year, on January 1, a man was also killed by a saltwater crocodile in the Pacific.

The attack happened at Rawa Bay in North Bougainville.Â 

The reptiles are common in Papua New Guinea and are capable of growing to immense lengths of seven metres or more.

Papua New Guinea, along with Australia, has the highest and healthiest population of large saltwater crocodiles in the world.
