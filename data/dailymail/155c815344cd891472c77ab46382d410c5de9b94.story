Sponge puddings are enjoying a revival as one of the nation’s favourite desserts after decades of declining sales.

Food experts say the surge in popularity is thanks to new varieties with modern flavours such as Swiss chocolate and salt caramel.

Demand for sponge puddings, which have been around since the 18th Century, has soared by 60 per cent at Tesco which now sells nearly 10 million a year.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘An evolution in flavours means that the sponge pudding has won back the hearts of British shoppers.’

The classic sponge and treacle pud became one of the most popular desserts during the Victorian era.

Sales reached their peak in the middle of the 20th Century when they became available in tins.However, the puddings were pushed out of favour by fancier foreign desserts in the 1980s.

Last week, Pret a Manger announced that retro-food porridge was it's biggest seller, with almost 9,000 pots being sold every morning.

Pret a Manger said its £2.35 ‘porridge pots’ were its bestselling item last year, selling more than 3.2million pots in the UK, equal to around 8,800 every day.

With just 243 calories in each 300g pot - compared to 616 calories in its All-Day Breakfast Roll - its porridge is also one of its more slimming options for breakfast.

Pret has only been selling porridge since 2010, and its popularity has surged recently.

Sales rose by ten per cent last year, compared to 2012, even managing to beat the previous bestseller - bananas - into second place in the 2013 league table of Pret’s most popular foods.

Such is its enthusiasm for porridge that it has specially trained ‘porridge chefs’ to make its breakfast bestseller.

It is stirred ‘gently but continuously’ until it is cooked to avoid lumps, and must be removed immediately from the heat when it is ready to stop it from becoming too gloopy.
