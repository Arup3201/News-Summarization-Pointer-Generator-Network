I’ll never forget the day Roy Hodgson made me jump 10 feet off my couch. It was a midweek afternoon and I was at home, winding down after training, when Roy called to tell me he had important news: I was going to be his England captain.

It was an unbelievable feeling, a real ‘punch the air’ moment, and I’m pretty sure Wayne Rooney will get to experience the same emotions this week when my successor is revealed. As far as I am concerned, there is no more worthy candidate to take over.

Roy has tremendous faith in Wayne. When the Manchester United striker was under pressure in the summer, when there was increased speculation about his place in the England team, his manager stuck by him and played him in the games that mattered. It was a big show of respect.

Perhaps other managers would have taken him out of the firing line and put him on the bench when the scrutiny increased, but Roy knows what Wayne brings to England’s team and, just as crucially, what he will continue to contribute in the next few years.

So why do I think Wayne is the No 1 choice? For starters, he is a natural leader. Aside from being a top player, one who commands respect within the group, Wayne is passionate about representing his country and won’t be fazed by the responsibility.

Before a game, he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room. He wouldn’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one-to-one, telling them what is expected.

When he was my deputy, he gave me great support and during our 11 years with England I saw him blossom. There were times when, as a young lad, he didn’t always say the right things in the dressing room but he has matured and chooses his words carefully.

He’s brave, too. Wayne won’t go missing in a game nor will he duck any issues with the media; whether he is in world-class form or going through a difficult patch, he doesn’t shy away from questions.

Don’t think, though, he will expose players in public if things aren’t going well. That wasn’t my style, nor will it be his. He knows the best place to deliver such words is in closed quarters and those he will have to speak to will appreciate him doing it the right way.

I also believe it is important for an England captain to lead his club. Everything that compelled Louis van Gaal to make Wayne United captain after working with him for six weeks are the qualities that Roy has seen at every get-together for the past two years.

My England journey with Wayne started in March 2003. I’d known of him since he was playing for Everton’s Under-13 side with my cousin, Anthony. I was well aware of the hype surrounding him when he broke into Everton’s first team.

The heat is turned up, however, when you get selected for England and I remember thinking, when we joined up for that European Championship qualifier away to Liechtenstein, ‘let’s have a proper look at what you’ve got’ before training with him for the first time. I missed his debut against Australia the previous month as I was injured.

It quickly became apparent this was his stage. During a training game he conjured a chip from nothing that sailed over David James; it was an audacious thing to attempt but Wayne — then only 17 — carried on as if it was the most natural thing to do.

AS the ball nestled in the net, the session stopped so everyone could applaud. It wasn’t a bad way to settle yourself into the group.

Taking the armband won’t be new for Wayne — he’s led England before, against Brazil in Qatar in 2009 and San Marino in October 2012 — but it is a different feeling from when you are just borrowing it.

I couldn’t wait to walk into the dressing room after Roy gave me the news, and it will be the same for Wayne. He will be desperate to get to Wembley for the Norway friendly and the added responsibility could be the catalyst to go on and break Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 goals.

Everything is there for him now. He is set to be captain and the next two tournaments, in France and Russia, are the most important he’ll play in — they can define his legacy.

We played together 71 times for England and at his best, he is a world-class talent. After the disappointment of Brazil, this is a fresh start for everyone and Wayne can lead the team positively into the new campaign.

If and when he leads the team out on September 3, I’ll be delighted for him. We are two lads from council estates in Liverpool who have loved playing for England, and I know what emotions Wayne will feel when he stands at the head of the line in the tunnel.

And how will I feel? I know I’ve made the right decision and I’ll enjoy having a breather, but I’ll miss playing for England. I know that for a fact.
