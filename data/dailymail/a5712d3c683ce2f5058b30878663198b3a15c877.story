A firm that processes raw placentas for new mothers to eat is facing closure over health fears in a landmark case.

The Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network makes capsules and smoothies for mums that it claims have numerous health benefits.

But it has been blocked from trading by a local authority over concerns bacteria within the placenta poses a hazard to a ‘significant proportion’ of women.

A legal case, understood to be the first of its kind, has been heard by a district judge who has reserved judgement.

During the hearing, IPEN argued the law shouldn’t be used to govern people who are ‘eating a product of themselves’.

Placentophagy - the act of eating the placenta - occurs in the animal kingdom and has become trendy in some circles in recent years.

Advocates include Mad Men star January Jones and Kim Kardashian also considered trying it.

Television chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall controversially fried a placenta with garlic and shallots to make pate for a Channel 4 programme 14 years ago.

Benefits are said to include boosting milk production, iron levels and reducing the chances of post-natal depression.

But experts say there is only anecdotal evidence for positive effects.

IPEN, which is based in Hertfordshire, was founded in 2010 by American Lynnea Shrief after she struggled to produce enough milk for her baby.

Dacorum Borough Council issued an Emergency Prohibition Notice in October to halt trading and this has been challenged by IPEN in a court case in Watford, Hertfordshire.

Barrister Nicholas George, representing the council, said the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, which is found in the vagina of one in ten women, could be passed onto the placenta.

The risk it therefore posed to many women was beyond the control of IPEN, which relies on the mother or her partner to look after the organ before it is handed over for processing.

But Bradley Say, representing the firm, said the placenta should be cooled to 8C within four hours of birth and the company always requested a history for each organ before accepting it.

IPEN’s duty was to issue good advice and trust the consumer to look after their own health, he added, and there was no record of customers reporting ill-effects.

‘The law does not need to step in and protect people when what they are eating is a product of themselves,’ he said.

IPEN’s website says it operates a network of ‘placenta specialists’ who are trained during an ‘intensive’ one-day course.

They also complete two online courses - a level 2 City and Guilds in Food Hygiene for Manufacturers and ‘UK Blood-born (sic) Pathogens-Infection Control’.

IPEN failed to respond to a request to comment yesterday.

But Mrs Shrief, a holistic therapist from Detroit, Michigan who now lives in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with husband Saher, was quoted recently saying how business had taken off.

‘Just two years ago we had 30 specialists on our books. Today we have 102,’ she said.

Brighton was a hotspot for the £150 service, she added, with one midwife claiming around one in eight mothers take their placentas home.

A council spokeswoman said there hadn’t been a similar legal case anywhere in Europe.

She added: ‘We don’t take people to court willy-nilly. We try to work with them beforehand - court is a last resort.’

District Judge Annabel Pilling, who heard the case last month, is expected to hand down her judgement next week.
