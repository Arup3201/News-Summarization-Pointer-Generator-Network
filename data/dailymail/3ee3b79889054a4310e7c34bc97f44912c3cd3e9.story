A British man is now claiming Scotland's proudest creation: Whisky.

Entrepreneur Daniel Szor will soon begin creating whisky - more than 500 miles from one of the homelands of whisky - Glenmorangie

Entrepreneur Daniel Szor, 51, plans to produce ultra-premium, small batch single malt whisky from his plant in the Cotswolds.

By 2017, visitors to the area could be enjoying a glass of Cotswolds Single Malt - for the price of £44.95 per bottle.

By then, Mr Szor aims to have his first run of 5,000 'single estate' bottles ready. Yet three years before the launch, he is already taking orders of the whisky.

Mr Szor is renovating two Cotswolds stone buildings at Stourton, near Shipston, in Warkwickshire to equip as the distillery, tasting rooms and offices.

He has also imported a Scotsman to help him with the job - master distiller Harry Cockburn and a wood and ageing consultant, Jim Swan, has also been brought on board.

As well as whisky, the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries.

By September this year, Mr Szor hopes to begin producing his first bottles and in the summer of 2015 gin from the distillery will go on sale.

The distillery will also create a rye whisky called Traitor's Ford Rye after a local landmark associated with the English Civil war.

Mr Szor said:'We are excited to be creating an adventurous new landmark for the region and for English whisky.'

The idea was born out of a passion for single malt. 'I was very much charmed by the Scottish and their production.

'I really didn't want to sit behind a desk any more so I thought to myself 'what else can I do?'

'I just happened to be looking out of the window at our Cotswolds house and I saw a beautiful field full of barley and thought I could distil that,' he said.

And all of the ingredients used in the distillery will be from the Cotswolds.

The businessman bought his first cast of the spirit in 2002, at the newly reopened Bruichladdich distillery on Islay.

Over time, Daniel, who is originally from New York, watched a number of whisky distilleries open, and grow from strength to strength, inspiring him to start his own operation.

The label on the bottles will read: 'Established 2013, single malt whisky'. Each bottle will be decorated with a pheasant

A new home for whisky: the Cotswolds. Mr Szor is pictured here in front of the stone buildings in Stourton, Warwickshire. Soon, bottles of Cotswolds single malt will begin being released from behind these doors

He plans to use locally sourced ingredients in his production, and has already pre-purchased 20 tonnes of barely from a nearby farm.

Cotswolds water will also feature as one of the main ingredients, and bottles of both single-malt and gin will be finished off with speciality water bought in from Blenheim, Oxfordshire.

But although Scotland is the country behind whisky, Mr Szor said he does not find its reputation for the drink intimidating, instead, he plans to follow the Scottish lead.

Mr Szor aims to have his first 5,000 bottles of Costwolds Single Malt ready by 2017

The distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries

From the Warwickshire site, he hopes to produce around 120,000 bottles of whisky a year.

He said: 'I never forget for a day what good quality drinks are being made just a couple of hundred miles north of us.

'What we put out in a year will be what the medium Scottish firms put out in a day or two.

'We are looking to build a reputation regionally, to us Scotland is not intimidating, it is a road to follow.

'I see a lot of people who want to go off and do their own thing, but I'm in this to make a product, I need to be able to sell my second bottle as well as my first.'

The Szor family is funding the project alongside the Cotswolds Distillery Founders Circle - which is offering interested investors an opportunity to take part.

Scottish version of the spirit is spelled without an 'e' the Irish version takes an 'e'

The spirit is distilled and made with cereals, yeast and water

Comes from the Gaelic 'uisge beatha', or 'usquebaugh', meaning 'water of life'

Since 2007, legally, Scotch Single Malt Whisky must be produced in Scotland

Term Single Malt Scotch Whisky can only be used for a Scotch Whisky distilled at a single distillery

From 2012, by law, bottles labelled Single Malt Scotch Wisky can only be produced in Scotland

Whisky
 does not mature, no matter how long it is kept for. For example, a 
10-year-old whisky does not become a 50-year-old whisky if kept for 50 
years

Different grains can be used for the spirit: Barley, rye, corn, maize

The process: First the whisky is malted, which means sugar is extracted from barley and turned into alcohol using yeast.

Next, the malt is ground and hot water is added

The product is distilled - which means that the liquid is heated to the correct temperature.

With whisky the process usually happens twice

Liquid is then stored and matured in oak casks

The whisky is then blended and bottled

Hundreds of miles away in Fife, another unlikely entrepreneur has had a bright idea: to create the first bottle of Scottish wine.

In September, in Upper Largo, some 40 miles from Edinburgh, weather dependant, Scotland's first grapes will be harvested.

Meanwhile in Fife: Christopher Trotter will soon be selling bottles of Chateau Largo from grapes grown some 30 miles from Edinburgh

By summer 2015, Christopher Trotter, the man behind the Scottish wine, will be enjoying a bottle of Chateau Largo - created off the A197.

Chateau Largo will be a medium dry white wine - with a similar taste to Chardonnay or Riesling.

The project of bringing wine to Scotland began with a throwaway comment when a friend of Mr Trotter's said that if climate change continued, Fife would be the same temperature as the Loire valley within 20 years.

Thanks to another friend who supported the project financially, Mr Trotter was able to bring 100 vines from Ryedale  in North Yorkshire to Scotland.

He is growing three grape varieties: Solaris, Siegerrebe and Rondo - all of which originate from Germany.

The grapes were chosen because they can all be harvested in September before temperatures drop.

The plot is a six acre site, with a south-facing slope overlooking the North Sea, where, Mr Trotter says the sunshine is 'fantastic'. Last July the average temperature in Fife was 21.4 degrees.

This morning however, the temperature is just 7 degrees and the humidity is 76 per cent.

But according to Mr Trotter the plot's location is key to the wine's success - there are no hills blocking the sun and drainage to get rid of the rain.

Mr Trotter has high hopes for the British wine industry. If the wine is a success, he hopes to attract an investor who will help finance planting 5,000 vineyards and produce 15,000 bottles of wine a year.
