Academic Theodora Dallas, 34, had told other jurors what her research had revealed about a defendant

A juror who caused a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant’s past on the internet was jailed for six months yesterday.

Lecturer Theodora Dallas, 34, turned to the web while trying a man for grievous bodily harm.

She discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at Luton Crown Court.

Dallas shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of Barry Medlock, 64, a violent drinker, was halted.

Dallas was charged with contempt of court after the case was referred to the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC, who said prosecution for contempt ‘sent out an important message’.

Greek-born Dallas claimed she had not understood internet searches were banned as ‘sometimes my grasp of English is not that good’.

But her excuse – as well as pleas by her counsel Charles Parry for a suspended sentence – was rejected by three senior judges who said her actions undermined the system of trial by jury. She will serve three months and be on licence for the remainder of the term.

The Lord Chief Justice, Igor Judge sitting with Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Openshaw said Dallas had ‘deliberately disobeyed’ the trial judge’s instructions not to search the internet.

Sentencing Dallas, Lord Judge said she was guilty of ‘contempt of the jury and the jury system’.

He stressed jurors could not ‘pick and choose which principles governing trial by jury they would obey’.

‘In the long run, any system which allows itself to be treated with contempt faces extinction,’ he said. ‘That is a possibility we cannot countenance.’

At the time of her jury service, Dallas was lecturing at the University of Bedfordshire in Luton after obtaining a doctorate of philosophy in health psychology. Her long-term academic career is now in jeopardy.

Mr Grieve, who prosecuted the case, later told Radio 4:  ‘If a juror goes off and carries out research and obtains information that has never been put before the jury about the defendant then that is perfectly capable of influencing that juror.

‘Nobody in court will have had the ability to deal with that information, explain it, challenge it or do anything about it. It is central to the fairness of our trial process that only what is heard in court should determine the jury’s verdict.’

In June 2011, a 40-year-old woman was 
given an eight-month jail term after becoming the first juror to be 
prosecuted for contempt of court for using the internet.

Joanne Fraill, 40, admitted using 
Facebook to exchange messages with Jamie Sewart, 34, a defendant already
 acquitted in an ongoing multimillion-pound drug trial in Manchester in 
2010.

Fraill, from Blackley, Manchester, 
also admitted conducting an internet search into Sewart’s boyfriend, 
Gary Knox, a co-defendant, while the jury was deliberating.

She was jailed after a hearing at the High Court in London before a panel of judges which included Lord Judge.

He added: ‘I take no pleasure in bringing such cases but they send an important message.’

In a statement read to the court, Dallas, whose cousin Elena Votsi designed the 2004 Athens Olympics medal, said she had been checking the meaning of grievous bodily harm on the internet.

She had typed the word ‘Luton’ into a search engine and found a newspaper article which mentioned Medlock and the previous rape allegation.

Dallas said in a written witness statement given to judges that ‘sometimes my grasp of English is not that good’.

‘I did not understand that I could make no search on the internet,’ she said.

‘I had no intention at all to prejudice the jury in any way. I had no intention to disobey what the judge said. I really apologise. I never thought it would cause such disruption.’

The court heard that Dallas’s actions resulted in a waste of court time and public money and caused ‘obvious’ damage to the administration of justice.

Medlock was later jailed for 11 years after a retrial.
