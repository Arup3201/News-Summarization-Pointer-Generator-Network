This huge litter of cute piglets shocked keepers at an activity farm after they were all born to one sow.

Staff had been expecting Daisy the Kunekune pig to have only four babies in her first litter.

They arrived for work in the morning to find the one-year-old mum had given birth to 11 of the adorable piglets without any help.

But there is little chance of rest for overworked Daisy who now has her hands full feeding the huge litter at the Farmer Palmer's Farm Park, near Wareham, Dorset.

Kunekune pigs are the smallest domesticated breed in the world, originally come from New Zealand, and have an average of six to eight piglets at a time.

It is not unheard of for a pig to have more in their first litter but because Daisy is very small staff expected fewer babies.

Sandra Palmer, co-owner of Farmer Palmer's, said: 'We expected her to have between four and eight piglets because she is so tiny.

'Daisy is about half the size of the other Kunekune pigs we have had here so we really didn't expect her to have so many, it was a bit of a surprise.

'She managed to do it overnight without any help.

'She is having lots of food to give her enough energy to feed the piglets and has her own separate compartment to sleep in so she can have some rest, which the piglets can access.

'The piglets sleep on top of each other to conserve body heat which is very cute. We are planning to keep them until the summer and then we will sell some of them.'

It is thought that Kunekune pigs were brought to New Zealand in the 19th century by whalers and were swapped for goods with the Maori people.

The name 'Kunekune' was given to the hairy pigs by the indigenous tribes, which translates to 'fat and round'.

The animals were on the brink of extinction in the 1970s until a conservation programme was put in place.

Kunekunes were imported to Britain in 1992 when horse rider Zoe Lindop and Andrew Calveley heard about their endangered status and began breeding them from the UK.
