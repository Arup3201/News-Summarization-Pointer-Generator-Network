Three hunters are trying to make amends for causing an outcry after they killed a rare albino moose considered sacred by the indigenous Mi'kmaq people.

The hunters, who have not been named, shot the animal in the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia in Canada during a recent trip to the area.

They claim they did not realise that their trophy would spark outrage among the Mi'kmaq, who believe albino creatures to be 'spirit' animals.

Their calamitous error was spotted by Jim Hnatiuks, when the trio brought the carcass of the dead creature 
into his hunting and taxidermy store in Lantz for it to be mounted.

He said: 'The hunters are saying "we wouldn’t have shot the moose if we had known it meant that much."

'They thought they had a 
successful moose hunt. It was odd that they shot a white moose, but to 
find out "wow", there’s a lot more behind it.'

Mr Hnatiuks insisted the hunters were unaware of the implications of killing the rare Spirit Moose.

They are returning the hide so the Mi’kmaq can perform a sacred ceremony.

Chief
 Bob Gloade, of the Millbrook First Nation, said: 'We’ve received full 
cooperation from the hunters and from Mr Hnatiuks as well and, during 
the ceremonies next week, they’re actually willing to participate.

First Nation communities voiced their anger after photos of the hunters posing with the moose appeared on social media.

Mr Hnatiuks is now acting on behalf of 
the hunters to ensure the moose is disposed of in a manner 
considered respectful by the Mi'kmaq.

'It shows a willingness to cooperate and an ability to show respect to not only the Mi’kmaq people but also to the culture and history.'

While it is not illegal to shoot a white moose
 during the hunting season the Mi'kmaq believe it breaks an unwritten rule surrounding a cultural belief held by them for generations.

Mr Gloade said the only protection open for the sacred animals is tradition, but he is hoping for legislation to protect spirit animals from being hunted.

He added: 'To recognise the importance and significance to the Mi’kmaq people is the next step moving forward and it’s a way of building better relationships between the aboriginal and non-aboriginal community.'
