A terminally ill nine-year-old whose last wish was to break a world record for receiving the most Christmas cards before succumbing to his life-long battle with cystic fibrosis has died - but not before hitting his goal.

Dalton Dingus, who inspired hundreds of thousands around the world to help him reach his goal, amassed more than 700,000 cards in his rural Kentucky home, more than tripling the old record.

'The cards give him something to look forward to. Something to get excited about,' Dalton's mother Jessica Dingus told ABC News before his death.

On Saturday, the tiny boy honoured as a courageous junior deputy, junior firefighter and junior rescuer by his local police and fire department, finally lost his fight.

Big accomplishment: Nine-year-old Dalton Dingus, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, received hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards from strangers across the world wishing him a merry Christmas

Outreach: The nine-year-old, pictured with his family here, had battled cystic fibrosis his entire life before amassing more than 700,000 cards in just a few weeks

Multiplying: In what started out as a few several hundred cards quickly multiplied with the family soon unable to contain them all in their rural Kentucky home

In a funeral service held on 
Wednesday just a sample of the handmade and store-bought cards were 
seen decorating the Bethlehem to Cavalry Apostolic Church in 
Salyersvile.

'There were lots and lots of people 
there,' Kathy Smithers who attended the service told ABC. 'Members of 
the police department, and the fire department, and the sheriff. It felt
like the whole town was here.'

But what remains to be seen if the 
9-year-old did in fact earn his name in the record books.

The last official Guinness record for a Christmas card category in 1992 was for 205,120 cards by Canadian Jarrod Booth.

The family's 
application to the Guinness World Records has yet to be made according 
to a spokeswoman. Guinness is also currently not monitoring attempts for receiving Christmas cards.

Extras: Adding one more card to his wish, along with a present from Santa seated before him, Dalton opens and reads just one of his hundreds of thousands of cards

Plea: It originally started after a family 
friend posted on Facebook asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his 
parents, Jessica and Tommy, pictured, could put up in the home - and the
message went viral

Generosity: The youngster received more than half a million cards, which no longer fit in his family home

Loved: UPS brought him 30,000 on Christmas Eve alone. Volunteers handpick ones for him to read

All over: Boxes and boxes of the cards were collected for the boy from all over the word, some in languages he and his family couldn't read

Outpouring: Piles and piles of letters are seen in USPS boxes awaiting sorting

'At this time, there has been no 
formal record application made with Guinness World Records for this 
particular attempt, so we are unable to speculate on whether or not it 
would constitute a new record,' spokeswoman Jamie Panas told ABC.

If the application is submitted, Ms Panas said they will consider re-opening 'a designation for his feat.'

Cards seen stacked in the family's 
garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as Germany, 
the Ukraine and South Korea in what his mother Jessica calls 'a Christmas miracle'.

The
first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on Facebook 
asking for messages of support that Jessica Dingus could place on the 
mantlepiece for her sick son.

But as cards started coming in from 
neighbours and friends, the Facebook message began spreading across the 
social network and was picked up by local media.

With this boost came thousands more cards, including stacks hand-delivered by Miss Kentucky and Kentucky State Troopers.

Show of support: A stack of the cards was hand-delivered to Dalton by Kentucky state troopers

Battle: Dalton relies on a mask to help him breathe. Doctors said he had just days to live in October, but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold, right

On Christmas Eve alone, the postal 
service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages, some of which were 
crammed full with cards, David Walton, from the US Postal Service, told 
ABC.

In addition to these, services such as UPS and FedEx delivered hundreds more.

There are so many that the cards could longer fit in the family's 
home and the postal service could no longer fit them all into a truck.

Instead, in another show of goodwill, a 
local television reporter had started filling a trailer to bring all 
the cards to Dalton's grandfather's church.

There, dozens of volunteers were sifting through the thousands of letters, 
opening each one and saving special ones to take Dalton to read himself.

'One little girl said she wished he was her boyfriend,' volunteer Debra Williams said. 'The big majority of the town has sent cards or is helping out. Everyone just wants to do what we can.'

Extra hands: Requiring extra help to handle and sort all the letters, the youngster was soon aided by volunteers, several seen here

Outpouring: The number of cards he has received has easily overtaken the last record in 1992 of 205,120

The youngster had stage four cystic 
fibrosis, which makes it near impossible to breathe. He took 18 
different medicines each day and wore a face mask to help him breath.

In October, doctors gave him just two to eight days to live, Jessica Dingus said.

But 'he's doing pretty good now,' she said. 'It's just been the best Christmas ever.
He's excited for the first time in a long time. He's smiling more. He's
laughing more, he's beginning to become how he was two years ago.

'I think just knowing people really do care for him, that the cards let him know people love him, it has all helped.'

There is no time limit on when Dalton can stop receiving the cards, the Guinness spokesperson said.
