Hannah Swanson was just 16 when she met the man who would change her life forever. The youngest daughter of a nurse and a policeman, she was still at school and looking forward to a bright future.

Not any more. That boy turned out to be a pimp and by the time she was 18, Hannah, a bright, educated, middle class girl, had disappeared into the world of vice and violence that blights Las Vegas.

One of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 35 million tourists each year, Las Vegas is also one of the wealthiest with net profits worth an estimated $15bn generated each year by the lucrative casinos.

Loss: Andrea Swanson told Ross Kemp of losing her daughter Hannah, now 18, to Las Vegas' vice rings

But the bright lights of the Strip conceal a dark underbelly; a seedy world of drug addicts, gambling junkies, gangs and violent pimps.

And it's in this grim, vice-ridden world that Hannah now lives - much to the distress of her mother, Andrea.

Speaking to Ross Kemp on the latest episode of Ross Kemp: Extreme World, Andrea told of her loss and utter distress that there's little she can do to get Hannah back.

'In the
autumn of her junior year at High School, she met this boy,' remembers Andrea. 'All of a sudden, 
she's not angry anymore and it all seems to be because of this new 
boyfriend. We were delighted.'

But her delight at her daughter's seemingly benign new boyfriend wasn't to last. 'All
 of a sudden, he ends up in prison for stealing cars,' she says. 'That's where 
the grooming happened.

Devastating: Andrea says her family has been ripped apart by the actions of their daughter's pimp boyfriend

Bright lights: Las Vegas is famous for its neon lights and casinos but they conceal a dark underbelly

'He was writing her letters, filling her head with
 all these promises... Writing me letters, telling me he cared for my 
daughter...'

After two years in prison, Hannah's boyfriend was released and Andrea and her family cautiously welcomed him back into their lives.

'We spoke to his 
parole officer,' she adds. 'I felt in control of the situation but that only lasted two to three weeks.

'Then they stopped following the rules, they started coming in a 
little later and we didn't always know where she was... Three weeks later, 
Hannah was gone.'

Drawn into a seedy world where women are sold for a few dollars and pimps reign supreme, Hannah was just 18-years-old and had had much to look forward to.

And she's not alone. According to Chris Baughman, the head of the PIT team, a branch of the Las Vegas police department's human-trafficking section, middle-class girls are becoming an increasingly common sight on the streets.

'There used to be a time back in the 80s 
where guys targeted the downtrodden - girls with drug addictions or from 
broken homes but we're far past that,' explains Boffman. 'We've seen girls as young as 12 
and they've come from a decent family.'

Chris Boffman of Las Vegas police says the level of violence dished out by pimps to their victims is 'unreal'

Arrests: Chris has arrested more than 100 pimps, many making millions from vice, during his career

Sex is big business in Las Vegas, with colourful posters advertising escort companies on every other billboard and even on targeted ad vans.

'The catch is, they aren't selling 
prostitution,' says Boffman. 'It is legal to run an escort company but some of these escort 
companies are run by pimps.'

And the rewards for those ruthless and violent enough to prosper can be huge.

'With 
three girls, they can make $1m a year,' adds Boffman. 'One of the reasons they're 
so violent and protective of the women that they're trafficking is that 
they have so much to gain and so much to lose if the girl should try and
 come to the police or run away.

'I've seen everything from women 
sexually assaulted, group raped, burned with irons, tattoos burned off 
them with irons, water boarding... The violence that we see here is 
unreal.'

For Andrea, her only hope is that her daughter will one day manage to escape her boyfriend, who they later discovered was a pimp.

'About two to three days 
before she graduated high school, I came home from work early and Hannah
 was there,' remembers Andrea.

Drugs: Many of the women who frequent Las Vegas' underworld are addicted to drugs like crystal meth

'I said "I'm worried about you Hannah" and she flipped out. 
She said "OK, OK, I f***ing trick-rolled! Is that OK now?

'You find the 
drunkest motherf***er on the strip, you proposition him, you take his 
ass up to the room and tell him to clean up.

'Then you steal him... you 
steal him blind. You take his wallet, his watch, whatever. I did it, 
Mum. Get the hell out of here!"'

She told her FBI agent husband who immediately called in Chris Boffman and the vice squad.

'They came over and Detective Boffman had a three-inch binder with her 
boyfriend's name on it. I was like "what is her boyfriend's name doing 
on that binder? What's going on?"

'They basically said they had enough 
evidence to build a case against her boyfriend as a pimp. I let him into
 our house! I let him into my heart, into my family and he was slicking 
off to fool me too.'

She isn't fooled anymore but Andrea remains estranged from her daughter and has no idea where she might be.

'We need tourist money in this town, we just don't need it off the backs of our daughters,' she adds.

'The
 attitude of Vegas is do what you would never do anywhere else, and 
leave. And you don't ever have to think about it again but my family has
 been ripped apart.'
