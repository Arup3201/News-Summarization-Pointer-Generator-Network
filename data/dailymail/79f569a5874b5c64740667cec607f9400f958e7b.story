The families of two unarmed policewomen killed in an ambush wept in court yesterday as the details of the women’s final moments were revealed.

They heard how PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were shot at 32 times less than a minute after arriving to investigate a fictitious burglary.

As they approached the property, the court was told, the front door was opened by a gunman.

Trial: Dale Cregan (left in police mugshot, 
right in court yesterday) is accused of murdering two unarmed police officers

Emotional: The families of Pcs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes (foreground) sobbed in the public gallery today as they heard an account of how Dale Cregan shot them both dead (court sketch))

Nicholas Clarke QC, prosecuting, said the pair were shot in the chest with a Glock pistol by one-eyed Dale Cregan, 29.

He said: ‘The body armour that they were wearing protected them and the bullets did not penetrate.

‘After the first shots both officers 
made a tactical retreat. PC Fiona Bone moved to her left and PC Nicola 
Hughes turned to run back up the path.

‘But as she retreated more shots were
fired. Nicola was shot, just below her armoured vest, in the middle of 
her back, causing her to fall forwards paralysed on to the path.

As she was falling or lying flat on her stomach, she was shot three more times.

‘Cregan then turned his attention to 
PC Fiona Bone. She was trapped in front of the lounge window and he 
discharged 24 shots at her.

Deaths: Cregan is accused of killing PCs Fiona 
Bone (left), 32, and Nicola Hughes (right), 23, and in a gun and grenade
attack on September 18 last year

Accused: Cregan sat in the dock flanked by security staff at Preston Crown Court

‘She managed to draw and fire her Taser but it was discharged into a hard surface, probably the paving.

‘Fiona was shot between five and eight times, receiving a total of eight gunshot-related injuries.

‘As she turned and fell, one bullet 
managed to get through under her arm, by her body armour. She was killed
by a perforating shot to the upper side of her chest which caused fatal
injuries to the top of her heart.’

Mr Clarke continued: ‘Cregan was not 
finished. He turned his attention back to PC Hughes and fired three more
shots into the back and side of her head.

‘She was shot eight times. Four shots
caused potentially fatal wounds. One had severed her spinal cord, 
causing instant paralysis and a potentially fatal wound to her abdominal
aorta.

'The three final shots fired into the head severely damaged her brain.’

Earlier, Preston Crown Court heard 
that Cregan – who was already wanted for the murder of father and son 
David and Mark Short – lured the two officers to the house in Mottram, 
Manchester last September by calling police and reporting a burglary.

Using the name Adam Gartree, Cregan 
said someone had thrown a concrete slab through his back window and then
escaped across a field on foot.

When told that officers would be round to investigate shortly, the court heard that Cregan replied: ‘I’ll be waiting.’

Mr Clarke said Cregan only stopped 
shooting the officers when his pistol ran out of ammunition. He then 
threw a hand grenade at them as they lay prone on the ground.

He said: ‘Such was the speed of the 
attack upon the two officers that only a matter of 31 seconds had 
elapsed between Nicola Hughes switching off the engine of their vehicle 
and Fiona Bone firing the Taser.’

Afterwards, it is alleged, Cregan 
jumped in a car and drove to a police station, where he is said to have 
told the counter clerk: ‘I’m wanted by the police and I’ve just done two
coppers.’

Victims: Cregan is accused of the murders of David Short (left), 46, and his son, Mark (right), 23, in the months before allegedly killing the Greater Manchester Police constables

Asked whether he had any weapons on 
him he reportedly replied: ‘I dropped the gun at the scene and I’ve 
murdered two police officers.

'You were hounding my family so I took
it out on yous.’ Later he is said to have added: ‘Sorry about those two
that have been killed. I wish it was men.’

Dale Cregan, originally from 
Droylsden, Manchester, pleaded not guilty to four charges of murder, 
four attempted murders and one of causing an explosion.

Nine other defendants have pleaded not
guilty to a variety of offences, including murder, attempted murder, 
causing an explosion and assisting an offender.

The case continues.
