Britain's biggest colony of leafcutter ants has self-destructed after chewing through a power cable in its tank.

More than a million of the tropical insects - who can carry 20 times their weight in their jaws - had been living at Butterfly World near St Albans, Hertfordshire.

They were dominated by a giant queen ant, the size of a small mouse, who was protected by an inner circle of soldier ants.

But in recent weeks, some of the ants had started nibbling on a power lead in their glass cabinet, which was linked to a water tank regulating their temperature.

They finally bit through the lead and sent an electric current shooting through the colony - killing the queen and her soldier guards.

Most of the worker ants escaped the shock as they were in a separate part of the enclosure cutting leaves. But carnage erupted when they returned to find the queen and her inner circle dead.

Without a queen to protect, fighting broke out and the leaderless ants started dying in huge numbers as they killed each other or starved to death.

And within two months, every single member of the colony at the wildlife park was dead.

Butterfly World spokeswoman Sally Cornish said there was nothing staff could have done to help the ants after their queen was killed.

'It was a freak accident. The ants are quite adventurous and I guess some of them took a fancy to the wire,' she said.

'The electric shock killed the queen, who was the size of a small mouse. Once that happened, everything changed.

'The ants started wandering around aimlessly because they had no queen to protect. They sort of lost their purpose in life. It was horrible to watch them all dying.

'Afterwards we dug into the tank to see if we could find her body but she wasnâ€™t there. We think the ants probably ate her after she died.

'We are all really sad about it because they were characters and although they could be a real nuisance they were part of Butterfly World.'

Ms Cornish added that the power lead had been inside the tank for four years and was a commonly-used method of controlling its temperature.

The park has now hired an ant specialist to find a replacement queen in the rainforest in Trinidad in a bid to start building a new leafcutter ant colony.
