The off-duty New Jersey police officer who was behind the wheel during a wrong-way crash that killed two on Staten Island last week had eight previous accidents and a DUI on his record.

Linden Officer Pedro Abad Jr. killed Officer Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez - both 28 - when he drove the wrong way after a night at a  strip club and collided head-on with a tractor-trailer.

Abad had his license suspended for seven months starting in October 2013 after an alcohol-related accident in Rahway, New Jersey, in February of that year.

Pedro Abad Jr. (pictured both) had eight accidents and a DUI on his record before the Staten Island crash

Abad was driving four people including himself when he crashed into the truck on Staten Island on March 20

Off-duty officer Frank Viggiano, 28 (left), was in the rear right seat and died in the crash. Patrik Kudlac, 23 (right), is now in a critical condition. He was also off duty at the time. 

His license was taken after a a judge found Abad refused to submit to a chemical test and was driving under the influence.

Before that crash, Abad had been involved in six accidents dating back to 2005, the New York Daily News reported. 

He was reportedly involved in another accident, his eighth, four months after the Rahway incident.

It is unclear if he was determined to be at fault in the accidents. 

The fatal crash on the West Shore Expressway on March 20 on State Island was his ninth accident.

Abad's license was restored in March 2014, but he had to use an ignition lock until September 2014, according to New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission spokeswoman Elyse Coffey.

The 27-year-old cop, who was hired as a police officer in 2008, was on the force at the time of the suspension. 

Abad and 23-year-old Officer Patrik Kudlac were in critical but stable condition after the crash.

The crash occurred after the three off-duty New Jersey cops and their friend left this Staten Island strip club

The truck driver suffered injuries that are not considered life-threatening. 

Hours before the crash, Abad had posted a photo on his Instagram page of three shot glasses filled with what he identified as 'Jack Daniels Fire on the house.' 

Investigators have applied for a warrant to test Abad's blood-alcohol level. 

New Jersey officials said there was one other violation on Abad's record. 

He was cited for driving with a cellphone in August 2012.

A funeral for Rodriguez will be held at on Wednesday and Viggiano’s funeral will be held  on Thursday.
