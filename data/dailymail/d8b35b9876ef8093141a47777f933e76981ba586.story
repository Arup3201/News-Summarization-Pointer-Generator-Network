When Manchester City paid Porto £32million this summer to make Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football, it was with a view to keeping goals out.

On Saturday, the Frenchman fell some way short of expectations. He scored an own-goal and conceded a penalty as the Barclays Premier League champions surrendered a two-goal lead at the KC Stadium.

Manuel Pellegrini’s side recovered to secure their first win in four league games with a decisive goal from Edin Dzeko and Frank Lampard’s fourth in a week, but the result should not paper over the fact that this game proved every bit as challenging for Mangala as his debut against Chelsea last weekend.

He passed that test with flying colours. This one did not go quite so smoothly. There was no one near the Frenchman when Liam Rosenior crossed into the box from the right flank in the 21st minute, having beaten Gael Clichy far too easily.

Mangala craned his neck and guided the ball over Willy Caballero into the top corner. There was a sympathetic pat on the back from captain Vincent Kompany but worse was to follow in the 31st minute.

Mohamed Diame clipped the ball towards Abel Hernandez inside the box and Mangala looked every inch a lumbering centre-back as he launched into a clumsy challenge, sinking his boot into the Uruguay striker’s midriff. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot and Hernandez slotted home.

Those kind of mistakes could prove far more costly against Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night, but Pellegrini was quick to defend his player.

‘You cannot analyse a player from one match, not when he played wonderfully in the last game and everybody said he was the best defender in the world,’ said the City boss.

‘He has played in the Champions League, won titles with Porto and is in the French national squad. We cannot analyse because he was unlucky or made a mistake. He’s a very good player and will continue playing in our team.

‘I think the own-goal was very unlucky. To score from where he did is very difficult. It made Mangala a little bit nervous and he gave away the penalty. But he played very well in the second half which wasn’t easy with a yellow card.’

Neither goal was the fault of Caballero, who kept his place in goal following the seven-goal thrashing of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup in midweek, but will relinquish it to Joe Hart against Roma.

‘For Willy it was good to play not just one but two games,’ added Pellegrini. ‘Joe Hart had played eight games in 32 days so that’s a lot of games for a goalkeeper.’

For the opening 11 minutes it looked as though City could do without a goalkeeper altogether as they raced into a two-goal lead.

Sergio Aguero was the recipient of Pablo Zabaleta’s knockdown in the seventh minute, swivelling to hook the ball past Allan McGregor and into the far corner. There were more serious question marks over Hull’s defending when Dzeko got the second four minutes later.

The Bosnia striker still had plenty to do when David Silva found him on the edge of the box. Two markers stood off him and Dzeko cut inside before sending a magnificent effort curling into the top corner.

That was the cue for Mangala to go into meltdown as Hull levelled before half-time with a magnificent fightback. Hull boss Steve Bruce said: ‘It shows the character that we rolled up our sleeves up and got back into it.

‘For a good hour, it could have gone either way. We gave it a right good go, but it just didn’t go for us.’

After Yaya Toure had rattled the post with a thunderous 30-yard strike, Dzeko nudged City back in front with a far less impressive effort in the 68th minute.

Again Silva was the provider, sliding the ball to his team-mate inside the box. Dzeko’s shot bobbled under Rosenior’s body and agonisingly wide of McGregor’s outstretched fingers on its way inside the far post.

After scoring a dramatic late equaliser against his old club Chelsea and two more in midweek, it was no surprise that Lampard weighed in with another after coming off the bench. He arrived to meet Zabaleta’s pass and stroke the ball home from close range.

It will no doubt fuel the debate about how long City can delay Lampard’s move to New York City.

‘I was absolutely sure that Frank could continue being a very important player,’ said Pellegrini. ‘At 36, he can’t play three (full) games in a week but nobody can be surprised at the way Frank Lampard is playing.’
