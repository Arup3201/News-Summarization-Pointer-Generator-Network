Steven Gerrard's dream of featuring in the FA Cup final at Wembley on his 35th birthday remains a reality after Liverpool saw off Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday night.

Gerrard was suspended for the quarter-final replay following his red card for a stamp on Manchester United's Ander Herrera at Anfield on March 22.

Yet Philippe Coutinho came to the rescue for Liverpool by scoring the game's only goal at Ewood Park to book their place in the semi-final with Aston Villa.

Even Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer feels it would be fitting for Liverpool's captain to lift the trophy before he leaves for Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy.

'I wish Liverpool all the very best,' Bowyer said. 'It would be fitting if they could win it for Gerrard, it would be a great way for him to finish his Liverpool career.

'He's been one of the best midfielders for a long, long time in this country. Whilst I wasn't wanting it to happen, now we're out of the cup I certainly hope it does.'
