Louise Thompson was Made In Chelsea's original fashionista, known for established a successful jeans company at the same time as studying for her final year exams at 
Edinburgh University and filming dramatic scenes for the E4 reality TV show.

And it seems there is just no stopping the pint-sized brunette, who is expanding her denim line, Pocket London, to include more than just brightly-coloured trousers.

Along
 with her university friend Edward Page, the 23-year-old has created
 the line from scratch and it's set to show at London Fashion Week in September.

Cool new look: Made In Chelsea's Louise Thompson models the edgy new range of clothes from her Pocket London brand

The design duo met on holiday in 2007 and came up with the idea over lunch.

'Edward
 had the idea a while back but as we had university commitments we 
didn’t act on it,' Louise told MailOnline.

'We were having lunch together and by 
the end we had decided to start a jeans line. We had no name or 
anything; we just had the concept of having a different colour pocket.'

Extended range: The range started off as colourful jeans range and has now expanded to include printed tees and slogan jumpers

Vibrant: The brand is famed for its brightly coloured trousers and Edward and Louise have added more relaxed culotte style trousers, as well as jeans

Edward added: 'Neither of us had prior design experience, so we had to go with our instinct.

'Louise
 knows a lot about the fashion world already and I have always trusted 
my taste. So between us we were confident we could take the brand in a 
certain direction, and off the beaten track in the jeans world.'

It seemed their gamble paid off: Pocket London, which is sold at TnT Showroom, Wolf & Badger and Natasha Coote, has become so successful and demand is so great that the duo are adding new styles, such as jumpsuits, as well as exciting new prints.

Brains behind the brand: Louise and Edward have been friends since 2007 when they met on holiday and thought up the idea over lunch one day

'There are many exciting projects on the horizon such SS15 The Spirit of London collection with the help of Maya Finkelstein Amrami, which is set to be sold worldwide, and will also be on display at London Fashion Week in September,' Edward said.

Louise is currently in New York with the rest of the Made In Chelsea cast filming for a special episode but Edward tells us she will be sporting all of their new designs whilst stateside.

So what's the future of Pocket London?

'With the brand making waves online, the future will see Pocket London moving into shops and spreading its wings overseas in cities such a Seoul, Jeddah and Hong Kong,' added Edward.
