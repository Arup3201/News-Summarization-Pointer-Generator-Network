The remains of a former Brazilian president have been exhumed for tests almost four decades after he died to determine whether he was murdered.

It has long been thought that Joao Goulart, known as Jango, died of a heart attack in exile in Argentina in 1976.

But digging work to remove Mr Goulart's body from his grave in Sao Borja, Brazil, began on Wednesday morning after a Uruguayan intelligence officer claimed that he was poisoned by spies working for the country's military government.

Mr Goulart had ruled in Brazil from 1961, but was overthrown in a military coup three years later.

He initially fled to Uruguay but later moved to Argentina after he was invited by then-president Juan Peron in 1973.

The progressive leader, who was known to have left-wing sympathies, died in December 1976 in Mercedes.

His death came months after Peron's widow Isabel was overthrown by a military junta.

No post mortem was ever carried out in either Argentina or Brazil where he was buried.

Officials said he had died of a heart attack.

But Mario Neira, who had been jailed for drug smuggling, alleged five years ago that Jango had been poisoned at the request of Brazilian military rulers.

He claimed that the plan to kill Mr Goulart, codenamed Operation Condor, was a collaborative effort between governments in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.

Neira alleged that spies swapped Mr Goulart's heart medication for tablets that triggered a cardiac arrest.

Now his claims are being investigated by Brazil's National Truth Commission.

Mr Goulart's body will reportedly be taken to Brasilia for tests before an official ceremony is held as he is the only former Brazilian president to be buried with out full honours.

According to the BBC, the commission said in a statement: 'Today we will open a new chapter in the tale of mystery which has surround the death 37 years ago of the former president.

'The exhumation will put an end to the anguish of his family and thousands of Brazilians who have sufficient reason to believe that his death did not occur spontaneously, as stated in the death certificate - which was issued without a prior post mortem examination.'
