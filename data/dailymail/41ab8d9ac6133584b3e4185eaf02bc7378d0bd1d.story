A teenage boy's trial begins today for the brutal rape and murder of his three-year-old half-sister.

D’Marques Jones faces life in prison over the death of Makayla Jones in June last year. The toddler died from 'multisysterm organ failure' caused by an infection built up after she sustained traumatic injuries.

Jones, from Barberton, is the first minor to be tried by a jury at the juvenile court in Summit County, Ohio.

Jury selection will begin at 9am on Monday morning under Judge Linda Tucci Teodosio.

Jones turned 17 last month and has been classified as a 'serious youth offender', his lawyer Scott A. Rilley told Ohio.com. He allegedly committed the crimes when he was 15. It has not been revealed what Jones will plea over the rape and murder charges.

If Jones is found guilty, he can only be held in juvenile detention until he is 21. However if the 17-year-old is convicted and then gets into trouble at the detention center, he could have adult prison time added to his sentence.

Makayla was taken to hospital by her father Marques Jones after he noticed the little girl was vomiting food and drink. Her teenage half-brother turned himself into police four months later in November, 2011 following an investigation.

His father had originally been 
considered a suspect after detectives found evidence that the child had 
been raped with an object.

He was described as 'distraught' that his son, a high school sophomore, was later charged over his daughter's death.

A murder conviction carries a life sentence while being found guilty of rape holds up to 11 years in prison.
