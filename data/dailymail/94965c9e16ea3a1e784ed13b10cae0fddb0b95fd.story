 Adelaide Crows defender Daniel Talia has kept his driving licence, telling a court he was speeding 36km over the limit because he was distracted by his sick cat. The 22-year-old AFL star, who drove 96km/h in a 60km/h road works zone on the South Eastern expressway in February, said he didn't see the reduced speed sign because he was so distracted by his cat vomiting violently in the back seat of his car. 

In the Adelaide magistrates court on Wednesday, Magistrate Bob Harrap fined Talia $824 for exceeding the speed limit by more than 30km/h. He lost four demerit points, instead of seven, because of his significant training commitments.

The court heard that Talia did not understand he was committing an offence at the time because his attention was diverted by the ill cat.
