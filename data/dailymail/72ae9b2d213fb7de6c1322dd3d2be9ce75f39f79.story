A 12 year-old from Milton Keynes has set a new Guinness record – for owning the largest collection of Moshi Monsters in the world with nearly 2,000 pieces.

Lucy Neath’s monstrous appetite for the toys, which are based on a virtual game which allows players to adopt their own pet monster, means she has collected 1,914 mementos.

The tiny creatures, which are known as moshlings, caught Lucy’s eye three years ago when she started playing on the online children’s forum.

Lucy from Milton Keynes has hoarded 1,914 Moshi Monster mementos over the years and has set a Guinness World Record for the world's largest collection

She bought her first item - a Moshling Series One bag containing random collectable moshling figures.

A Moshling Collectables Pack typically costs £3.75 for five figurines.

But Lucy didn’t stop there and now her enormous collection ranges from from Moshlings and mugs to Moshi Monsters cushions and cuddly toys.

Guinness World Records contacted Lucy after seeing her Moshi Monsters YouTube page.

In two years Lucy has posted hundreds of videos, gained over 14,000 subscribers, and had more than 9,500,000 views.

She said:  ‘I really had no idea this would happen when I began playing the online version of Moshi three years ago.

‘I
 spend most of my pocket money on Moshi merchandise and more than 
anything, I hope one day to go to Moshi HQ as it would be a dream come 
true.’

And her dream is set to be made a reality as Mind Candy, who produce Moshi Monsters, have invited her to the company’s headquarters in the heart of ‘Tech city’ in east London.

Michael Acton Smith, founder of Mind Candy who produce Moshi Monsters, said: ‘At Mind Candy we were very excited to learn that Lucy has set a new Moshi related world record and is a super fan! - We can’t wait to have her at Moshi HQ.’

Annie Nguyen, from Guinness World Records, said: ‘We were blown away by the collection and it’s a pleasure to welcome Lucy, and her 1,914 record-breaking Moshi friends, into the Guinness World Records family.’
