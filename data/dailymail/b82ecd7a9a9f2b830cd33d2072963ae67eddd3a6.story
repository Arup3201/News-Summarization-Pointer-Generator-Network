Stitched together with chicken skin and stuffed with who-knows-what, this terrifying teddy will very likely put those with even the most hardened stomachs off their Christmas dinner.

A picture of the festive creation, likened to a Frankenstein's monster of the toy bear world, has gone viral on Twitter after it emerged yesterday.

It comes just a few days after pictures emerged of the so-called Cthurkey - a frightening hybrid of crab, turkey and octopus that was put together by a database administrator and served on an old Nazi plate complete with Swastika.

Seconds, anyone? A picture of the stomach-churning creation, likened to a Frankenstein's monster of the teddy bear world, has gone viral on Twitter

The latest culinary car crash, named the turkey bear, was posted on Twitter yesterday morning by chef Simon Hulstone, who joked that he had made it for his children.

However, it later transpired that it was made by Russian artist Viktor Ivanov, who used chicken rather than turkey.

Details about the bear are sparse and it is not clear what it has been stuffed with.

Describing himself on his website, Mr Ivanov says: 'I work with found objects for which I find a new meaning and function.

'Objects become reconfigured, searching for a new purpose. Mutation of ideas and forms is central my practice.'

Earlier this month, data administrator Rusty Eulberg revealing his menacing insectoid-like feast of turkey, crab and octopus - and insisted the ingredients taste great together.

Rusty Eulberg said his 'culinary abomination', which was conceived and created two years ago, is inspired by the horrifying imagery of fantasy writer H.P. Lovercraft's octopus-headed creature the, Cthulhu.
