A former model who used sunbeds for over 20 years has called for them to be banned after she was diagnosed with rare eye cancer and given weeks to live.

Mother-of-one Debi Gibson from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, starting using sunbeds at the age of 14. She decided not to use protective goggles when on the sunbed so she would be free of any tan lines.

The 42-year-old was diagnosed with rare eye cancer in April 2012 - and has now been given a terminal diagnosis after the disease spread to her liver.

The mother, who had one eye removed in October 2012 because of the disease, is now calling for sunbeds to be banned.

Speaking today she said: 'I want 
something good to come out of my death. All this because I wanted to be
 brown. I would like sunbeds to be banned.

'I am going to have to leave my 
daughter behind. She knows it all. She doesn't understand everything, 
she just knows that mummy is going to go to heaven soon, that mummy has a
 nasty disease called cancer and it is going to kill her.'

Mrs Gibson, who has starred in Eastenders and alongside Madonna in musical Evita, gave up sunbeds in 2005 after hearing stories of others being struck down with cancer.

But after suffering blurred vision in April 2012 she was told she had a choroidal melanoma, a type of cancer that affects the eye.

A year later surgeons removed her left
 eye after chemotherapy failed to kill the deadly growth, which was 
covering half of her eyeball.

Earlier this year she was handed the devastating news that the disease had spread to her liver.

She said: 'There
 is this pressure when you are modelling or in the acting profession to 
be the perfect colour. I saved up the money myself when I was 14 to buy a
 sunbed and had it at my parent's house.

'I used it all the time, back then there weren't any guidelines around, people thought this was the safest way to tan.

'I eventually became a personal trainer at a gym and I used to use the sunbed there as well.

'They came with goggles, but those left you with ugly tan lines so I didn't use them, I never thought that would kill me.

'I moved to London when I was 18 to become an actress and a model. There was so much pressure to look tanned, I went through that with the film industry.

'Then around 2005, there was a lot of bad press around sunbeds, so I stopped using them.

'In 2012 I woke up and found everything was blurry, I went to my doctors and he sent me to the hospital.

'They did a scan and sat me down and told me that half of my eye was covered in a tumour.

'It's rare, only around one in every six million people get it, the doctors said it is only seen in sunny countries and they only thing they could think caused it was my use of sunbeds without the protection.

'They tried chemo but eventually they told me it hadn't worked as they had hoped.

'I was already going blind at this point, so it felt easier when they told me they were going to take the eye out.

'It
 happened pretty quickly. They told me I needed the operation in the 
October, and it was removed in the November. It was a horrendous time.

'Then after about a year I went back for another scan and they told me it had spread to my liver and I was going to die.

'The doctor gave me eight weeks to live, which runs out next week.'

'At first I went mad, completely mad, I pulled my daughter straight out of school and we all went on holiday.

'But after a little while I came to terms with it. The doctors have me on a trial drug and are giving me chemo to shrink the tumour. That could give me months or years more time.'

Her husband Darren Gibson said: 'It has been horrendous. Nurses have been coming out to see her from the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and they have been fantastic.'

'Debi is an amazing woman. She never seems scared, I'm sure she's struggling inside sometimes, but she is an actress.'

The Sunbed Association (TSA) was set up in 1995 and is a non-profit representing operators, manufacturers and distributors of sunbeds.

Members of TSA agree to comply with the Sunbeds (Regulations) Act.

It includes making sure sunbeds 
meet European standards, that trained staff are on duty at all times and
 that protective goggles are always worn.

A new law introduced in 2011 
means it is illegal for under-18s to use sunbeds.

Research has shown using sunbeds increases your risk of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent.

The Health and Safety Executive advise people with fair skin and moles not to use them at all because of the risks involved.

A new law introduced in 2011 means it is illegal for under-18s to use sunbeds.

A TSA spokesman said: 'Millions of people use sunbeds safely and responsibly following correct usage guidance, which includes the wearing of protective eyewear.

'Therefore, to call for a ban on a product or service when it has been used inappropriately is unfortunately misguided and even more so when self-diagnosis on the cause of a disease has taken place.

'Education about responsible use of sunbeds and sunbathing in general is of course very important, which is why we would always recommend anyone using a sunbed does so in a Sunbed Association member salon, where they will receive correct advice and information from properly trained staff.

'UV penetrates the skin, so it is insufficient either on a sunbed or when sunbathing just to close your eyes, as this will not protect them.'
