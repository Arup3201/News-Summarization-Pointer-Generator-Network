Nerves in a World Cup quarter final can get the better of any side - but Argentina are lucky that they had the best player left in the competition to calm theirs.

It took their talismanic forward just eight minutes to open up Belgium and help to swing this tight tie in the South Americans' favour. Even his stoppage time one-on-one miss could not ruin the celebrations.

Vincent Kompany and co have conceded just two goals at this World Cup - an Algerian penalty and a United States consolation goal - but Messi made a mockery of them with some fancy footwork to start the move for Gonzalo Higuain's opener.

8 minutes: Magnificent from Messi - he dodges a couple of challenges in midfield, plays the ball to Angel Di Maria who sets up Gonzalo Higuain for the opener.

39 minutes: Big chance for Argentina as Messi escapes Axel Witsel and plays it to Marouane Fellaini who is fouled.

40 minutes: Messi takes the free kick and opts for power but it goes over the bar.

48 minutes: Argentina's talisman lofts a pass to the back post but it is overhit.

94 minutes: Messi is put through on goal on the counter as Belgium throw men forward but he sticks his shot straight at Thibaut Courtois.

With his back to goal, Argentina's captain twisted and turned, left then right, and quickly escaped the attentions of Marouane Fellaini and Toby Alderweireld before slipping the ball to Angel Di Maria.

From there, the ball reached Higuain who brilliantly volleyed in on the turn.

And that was all it took - 1-0 and it looked so simple for Messi, leaving players from one of the World Cup's best defensive sides looking like statues.

It was a tough afternoon for the creative players: Di Maria came off injured in the first half and Eden Hazard saw himself subbed as Belgium searched for an equaliser, but Messi still made the difference.

He had a quiet second period but then so did most. And he still managed to be key for his country, dropping deeper into midfield where he completed 86.4% of his 22 passes.

Leader: Messi has captained Argentina to their first World Cup semi final in 24 years

His crossing was less successful and 
his dribbling suffered but Argentina were generally satisfied with 
holding Belgium back as both sides showed weaknesses.

Unfortunately
 he missed the chance to add to his four-goal haul so far in the 
tournament by failing to finish past Thibaut Courtois when through on 
goal.

But what mattered
 for Messi is that he is one step closer to a dream final in the 
Maracana and finally proving his doubters wrong on the international 
stage.

The undisputed best remaining player in the World Cup is two steps from lifting the trophy.
