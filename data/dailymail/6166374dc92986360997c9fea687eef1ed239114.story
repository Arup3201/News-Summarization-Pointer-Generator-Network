Barcelona have had their appeal against a two-window transfer ban rejected by FIFA following a hearing on Wednesday. 

The Spanish giants will be barred from signing players in the next two transfer windows - taking them through until January 2016 - after breaching transfer conditions to do with 'the protection of minors'. 

But the club have confirmed that they will now take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in order to have the ban overturned.

Just days after hearing that Luis Suarez would not have his ban for biting reduced - though the forward is now allowed to train with the club and made his debut in a friendly on Monday - the Catalans once again attempted to plead their case for leniency.  

A club statement read: 'Regarding the resolution handed today by FIFA's appeal committee with regards to the transfer and registrations of players under 18, FC Barcelona announces that it will continue to defend its interests to the highest sporting legal court, in this case the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

'FC Barcelona cannot agree in any way with the resolution that goes against the spirit of our Masia (Barcelona's youth academy), an example of academic, human and sporting development, recognised worldwide.'

FIFA announced in April that Barca would be unable to sign any players for two transfer windows due to the 'international transfer of minors', but the Spanish giants immediately appealed the decision.

That caused their embargo being indefinitely postponed - leading to the signing of five players this summer.

The most notable arrival was the £75million acquisition of Suarez from Liverpool.

Thomas Vermaelen, Jeremy Mathieu, Claudio Bravo and Ivan Rakitic also joined the Catalans this summer.

FIFA's statement on Wednesday morning read: 'Barcelona is to serve a transfer ban which will see the club prevented from registering any players at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, starting with the next registration period (January 2015) given that the appeal of the club had been granted suspensive effect by the chairman of the FIFA appeal committee.

'FC Barcelona has also been ordered to pay a fine of CHF 450,000 (£295,000) and been given a period of 90 days from today in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.'
