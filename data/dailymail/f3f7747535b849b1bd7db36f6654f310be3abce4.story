A picture taken of the al-Hilli family just 15 minutes before they were gunned down has been released by French media.

The image, which shows Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, with their two children, was part of a shocking collection of crime scene photographs taken in the aftermath of the Alps shooting.

The photos were revealed as a former police officer was arrested in connection with the murder of Mr al-Hilli, a British engineer and his family while they were on holiday.

Mollier

The 48-year-old, named locally as Eric
 Devouassoux, lives close to where Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 
47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were shot near Lake Annecy, in 
eastern France.

The trained
 marksman and gun collector served for France’s municipal police in the 
town of Menthon-Saint-Bernard before leaving last June.

This
 morning, it was reported that an antique Luger pistol has been in 
Devouassoux's home, the  same type of weapon was used to gun down the 
al-Hilli family and the cyclist.

Searches of two properties 
linked to him yielded more than 10 weapons including a pistol similar to
 the 7.65mm Luger P06 used in the bloodbath.

While
 the hand gun found in Devouassoux’s house in the village of Talloires 
is of a different calibre, detectives said ‘a manual; of the PO6, which 
was widely used by the Swiss Army in the 1920s and 30s, was also found.

In a further development, a ‘light grey motorbike’ was removed from the property by police, who were seen digging up the garden and using metal detectors.

Last night it was claimed  Devouassoux’s mobile phone data indicates that he was around the crime scene 
‘at the precise time’ the family, from Claygate, Surrey, and local 
cyclist Sylvain Mollier were killed in September 2012.

The
 al-Hillis’ daughters survived the attack. Zainab, then seven, was shot 
in the shoulder and clubbed with a pistol by the gunman, who left her 
for dead.

Zeena, then four, 
escaped unharmed by hiding beneath her dead mother’s skirt. She was only
 discovered eight hours later when police searched the family’s car.

A
 local police source said that 'technical evidence compiled using the arrested man's mobile phone also places him in 
the area at the precise time of the crime.’

The man, who has not yet been officially named by police, is being held in custody on suspicion of ‘murder as 
part of an organised gang’, said French investigators, who added there 
could be more arrests soon.

He
 is the second suspect arrested since the shootings, and was brought in 
following the publication of an e-fit picture said to look ‘just like 
him’.

The e-fit image shows
 a bearded motorcyclist spotted by two forestry workers just before the 
bloodbath, which was carried out using an antique Luger pistol popular 
with many Alpine gun owners.

Mr
 al-Hilli’s elder brother Zaid was the first suspect arrested last year.
 But the 54-year-old has been told by British police that there is not 
enough evidence to charge him in connection with the killing of  his 
brother.

Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor leading the inquiry, described the arrest as a ‘significant breakthrough’.

He said the arrested man, who is married, was held at gunpoint as he left his home around 10am.

Guns were seized, but there was no violence, and the suspect ‘came quietly’, said Mr Maillaud.

Officers
 from the CIGN, a tactical military unit, joined local gendarmes in 
yesterday’s raid, which is thought to have taken place in the hamlet of 
Lathuile – just a few miles from Chevaline, where they al-Hilli family 
were murdered.

Antoine de 
Menthon, the Mayor of nearby Menthon-Saint-Bernard where the man served 
as a police officer, said the man was ‘removed from his job in June’ and
 ‘then asked to leave communal housing’.

He said that the man was trained
 in the use of guns during his career in the force, and had gone on to 
work as a security guard in the Swiss city of Geneva.

A
 second raid also took place on a house in the village of Talloires, 
where police were seen digging up the garden and carrying out searches 
using metal detectors.

The arrested man recently bought a house in Talloires, and was renting it out.

Lathuile
 is also the home of Brett Martin, the British cyclist and ex-RAF 
Serviceman who was the first person to find the al-Hillis’ bodies.

Last
 night, Mr Martin, 54, said: ‘I have just heard on the news that the man
 is from Lathuile. It is uncomfortable that it is so close. I have no 
idea who it is.

‘It is a like any village in England, you know your neighbours but  not everyone.’

Zaid
 al-Hilli, of Chessington, Surrey, refused to comment on the arrest last
 night as he left the luxury golf course where he works.

The suspect 
reportedly lives in the village of Lathuile – pictured - which is a few miles from Chevaline
 and scene of another brutal gun murder in November last year

A
 Surrey Police statement yesterday said: ‘The arrest has resulted from a
 line of inquiry in France and is not as a result of the investigation 
carried out in the UK.’

Mr
 Maillaud said the man could not yet be named 'for legal reasons'. He 
reportedly lives in the village of Lathuile – a few miles from Chevaline
 and scene of another brutal gun murder in November last year.

Lathuile
 is also where Brett Martin, the British cyclist who was the first 
witness at the scene of the Al-Hilli murders, owns a home.

In
 November, masked gunmen shot a woman dead in Lathuile, a hamlet next to
 Lake Annecy. Two men wearing cagoules and gloves broke into the home of
 the owners of a private camping site.

The woman was killed by a bullet to the chest at around 2am, while her husband was hit with the butt of the weapon.

Mr Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor, would not rule out a link between the Chevalina and Lathuile murders.

Investigation: French Prosecutor Eric Maillaud (pictured) said the suspect, who lives near to where the brutal killings took place, could not yet be named 'for legal reasons'

There were only 8000 made in black, which is the colour the forestry workers saw.

Today Surrey Police confirmed: 'Surrey Police can confirm that an arrest has been made in France today in connection with the murders of four people near Annecy, southern France in September 2012.

'The arrest has resulted from a line of inquiry in France and is not as a result of the investigation carried out in the UK.'

Police have struggled to make any progress in the case despite a major investigation carried out in coordination with British officers.

Saad al-Hilli's accountant brother Zaid, 54, from Surrey, was arrested in Britain in June last year on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder but police said last month there was insufficient evidence to press charges.

But the French have expressed ‘extreme frustration’ at the decision, saying they still have questions to ask him and consider him a suspect.

He had been involved in a dispute with his brother over their father's will.

A Surrey Police spokesman last month: ‘At this stage there is insufficient evidence to charge him with any criminal offence and no further police action is being taken at this time.

54, from Surrey, was arrested in June last year on suspicion 
of conspiracy to commit murder but police said there was 
insufficient evidence to press charges

‘This remains a French-led investigation and officers from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team continue to work closely with the French authorities’.

Since the deaths, speculation has surrounded whether the shooting was linked to the al-Hillis' native Iraq, or Saad's work as a satellite engineer.

The horrific murder scene was discovered by cyclist Mr Martin, who found Iraqi-born Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old dentist wife and her elderly mother blasted to death in their BMW.

The al-Hillis' first-born daughter Zainab was shot in the shoulder and beaten, but survived. Her then four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's body and was only discovered eight hours after the murders.

The al-Hilli brothers were alleged to have been locked in an inheritance dispute centred on the £825,000 home in Claygate where Saad and his family lived after their mother died from a heart attack in 2003.

Zaid, who inherited half the property, claimed that in 2011 his brother began to demand his share of the house 'there and then' and pinned him down during a row.

The two men never spoke again except through lawyers, but Zaid denied rumours that he had threatened to kill his brother.

He said he knew little about a Swiss bank account containing the proceeds from their father's business in Iraq.
