We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Emily Blunt's waist.

It's hard to believe that Emily Blunt gave birth less than a year ago - at a recent awards ceremony, she revealed an incredibly trim waist. The 31-year-old actress attributes her post-baby physique to training she did with co-star Tom Cruise for the film Edge Of Tomorrow.

'My body bounced back quicker,' she says. 

For the role, she took up gymnastics, martial arts, weight-training and sprint-training. She wore a 30-to-80 lb weighted vest for circuit training, did sprints and stair-running. 

'It was six days a week, two-and-a-half hours a day,' she says. 'It was brutal at first, then became addictive.'

What to try: 

The Russian twist is a fantastic waist-trimming exercise. 

Sit on the floor, with knees bent and feet flat. 

Clasp hands lightly together and raise them to eye level.

Lean back a little and raise feet a few inches off the floor. 

Keeping your legs and trunk stable, bring hands to your right side, so they touch the floor.

Without stopping, lift hands over to the left side and tap the floor again. 

Repeat 12 to 15 times.
