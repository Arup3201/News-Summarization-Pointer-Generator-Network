The first words of a hiker who was forced to eat his beloved dog to stay alive in the wilderness were: 'I want to get a new dog.'

Marco
 Lavoie, killed and ate his beloved pet after a bear destroyed his canoe
 and food supply - leaving him 500 miles outside Montreal for three 
months.

The German Shepherd saved his life, chasing off a
 bear, just three days before Lavoie killed it with a rock, according
 to Canadian news agency QMI.

Lavoie was stranded alone for three months in a remote area of Canada and was found close to death by rescuers last Wednesday.

After the bear attack, he sprained his ankle so he was unable to hunt or find any other source of food.

Lavoie
 was rescued by helicopter on Wednesday. He had lost 90 pounds and was 
suffering from hypothermia. He is now in a critical condition in a 
hospital in Northern Quebec.

And today a spokesperson for Sûreté 
du Québec told MailOnline the first thing Lavoie told officers was that 
he wanted to get a new dog.

Richard Carbanneu said: 'He is very 
ill and he can barely talk, but when our officers spoke to him in 
hospital the only thing he said was, "I want to get a new dog."

'I
 suppose he must feel very guilty about eating his pet, it is obvious he
 loved him very much and did not want to do what he did.'

Mr Carbanneu joined survivalists in saying that Lavoie's decision to  sacrifice his dearest companion likely saved his life.

'He 
was alone in the wilderness with no food for weeks. He had badly hurt 
his ankle as well, so he could not hunt for food. I suppose he thought he
 had no choice,' he said.

The 44-year-old hiker was in the midst of a lengthy solo climbing trip into the the forbidding Nottaway River wilderness when disaster struck.

Lavoie left his friends and family at home and took only his beloved German Shepherd for company.

In the midst of the long hike, a bear attacked him - destroying his canoe and the food supplied he brought with him.

'He is an experienced hiker, but he ran into serious trouble,' Mr Carbanneu said. 

Lavoie has been able to say only a few words to rescuers - and it could be some time before authorities get a full picture of what happened in the wilderness.

'He
 will be in hospital for around two weeks and I don't think he will be 
able to talk much before then. Hopefully when he is well enough he will 
be able to give is a better idea of what happened,' Mr Carbanneu said.

Andre Diamond, a Waswanipi Cree who lives on an island at the mouth of the river, told the Toronto Sun he had warned Mr Lavoie to stay away.

'He
 said it didn't scare him, but it's not a river to travel alone,' Mr 
Diamond said. 'Other adventurers have gone there over 20, 30 years and 
never came back.'

Mr Lavoie is currently in serious condition in hospital.
