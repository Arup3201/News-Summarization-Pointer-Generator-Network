A plan to boost herds of bighorn sheep in southern Arizona has been mired in controversy after half of the animals that were relocated were devoured by mountain lions.

Wildlife officials spent $150,000 taking 31 of the protected species to the Catalina Mountains, near Tucson, only for 15 of them to be eaten by predators within a few months of arriving.

Now animal rights activists are calling for the conservation project to be scrapped, arguing that it cruelly exposes the sheep to unnecessary risk.

And they have slammed plans to shoot mountain lions in transplant areas before bringing in the bighorns, saying that the big cats should not be punished for following their natural predatory instincts.

Bighorn sheep once flourished across the western U.S. until a precipitous decline in their population over the past century. There are now an estimated 6,000 bighorns in the whole of Arizona.

In an effort to rebuild a herd which disappeared from the Catalinas in the Nineties, Arizona's Game and Fish Department in November began a three-year plan to transplant bighorns from Yuma to the mountain range near Tucson.

In the first phase of the $600,000 project, wildlife officials spent $150,000 on catching 31 sheep, fitting them with GPS tracking collars and flying them by helicopter to their new home.

But just four months later, 15 of the animals had been caught, killed and eaten by mountain lions, Fox News reports.

Now officials are planning to cull the big cats before executing the next stage of their conservation plan, even after the shooting of two in the aftermath of the bighorn feeding frenzy sparked protests.

Jim Paxon of Arizona's Game and Fish Department told Fox News that 'in hindsight, we should have taken out some mountain lions.'

'Conservation of wildlife is never easy, never quick and is often what biology professors call messy,' he said, adding that officials are not planning a 'wholesale removal of mountain lions' from the Catalinas.

'All weâ€™re doing is removing mountain lions that prey on bighorn sheep in the best habitat area for those sheep,' he said.

Critics say that Arizona's bighorn conservation plan was badly planned from the start and should be stopped immediately.

Ricardo Small of the group Friends of Wild Animals called the planned mountain lion cull 'a mistake', claiming that less competition merely leads to more cubs and 'the result is more mountain lions than were there to begin with.'

'It's a waste of bighorn sheep and a waste of mountain lion,' he added.
