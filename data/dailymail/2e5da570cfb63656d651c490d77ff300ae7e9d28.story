Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie and Amy Adams were among the stars snubbed at this year's Academy Awards nominations. 

Jennifer had admitted just hours prior to the announcement that she was hoping to be asleep when the Oscar nods were announced, and hopefully that was the case because she did not receive her first Best Actress nod for her role in Cake.

The 45-year-old actress had received nominations at the Golden Globes, SAGs and Critics' Choice Awards but sadly it wasn't enough for the Academy.

Snubbed: Jennifer Aniston did not receive a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her role in Cake

Eyes closed: Amy Adams won't be getting her sixth Oscar nod after she was snubbed for Best Actress, despite winning the Golden Globe equivalent on Sunday for her part in Big Eyes

Jennifer had said on Wednesday night that she wouldn't be waking up early to hear the announcement.

'I'm not going to torture myself,' Aniston told E! News. 'I'll be in bed. I'll be in bed with my beloved and my dogs dreaming wild little dreams.'

Amy Adams actually won the Golden Globe for her Best Actress performance in Tim Burton's Big Eyes on Sunday night but she was, rather surprisingly, not recognised this year.

No to Unbroken: Angelina Jolie's wartime epic did not pick up a Best Picture nomination or a Best Director for the actress

Amy had been nominated five times at the Oscars; once for Best Actress and four times for Best Supporting Actress.

Instead Marion Cotillard, (Two Days, One Night), Felicity Jones (The Theory Of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl), and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) are up for the highly-coveted prize.

Angelina Jolie was also overlooked in both the Best Director and Best Picture category for her wartime epic Unbroken.

Based on the harrowing but inspiring story of Olympian turned World War II prisoner Louis Zamperini, Unbroken seemed set to become an awards season frontrunner but it has been overlooked across the board apart from in the more technical categories. 

Surprise: Based on the harrowing but inspiring story of Olympian turned World War II prisoner Louis Zamperini, it was thought Unbroken would be an awards frontrunner

She wasn't the only female director to be snubbed as Selma's Ava DuVernay did not get recognised for her work on the civil rights period film. 

The shortlist was all male featuring Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), Richard Linklater (Boyhood), Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher) Wes Anderson (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game). 

Also missing from the list were the four time Oscar-nominated and twice-winning actor/director Clint Eastwood for American Sniper, as well as Christopher Nolan for his epic Interstellar.

It's a shock for most film-lovers to see the Sci-fi blockbuster and Angelina's Unbroken missing from the Best Picture shortlist, considering there are 10 spots in the field and only eight filled. 

Another year for Jessica: Chastain did not get a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her turn in A Most Violent Year

Missed out: Jake Gyllenhaal and Reno Russo had been celebrated for their performances in Nightcrawler but neither received nods in the Best Actor or Best Supporting Actress categories

Elsewhere, Jessica Chastain did not receive a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her turn in A Most Violent Year but Emma Stone picked up her first ever Oscar nomination in the same category.

Jake Gyllenhaal, Riz Ahmed and Reno Russo had been celebrated for their performances in Nightcrawler but not one of them received a nod in the Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor or Best Supporting Actress categories.

Same goes for British actor Timothy Spall, who won the Best Actor award at last year's Cannes Film Festival for his role as the titular character in Mr. Turner, but failed to secure a nod at the Oscars or the BAFTAs.

Not the Academy's cup of tea: British actor Timothy Spall won the Best Actor award at last year's Cannes Film Festival for his role as the title character in Mr. Turner but failed to secure a nod at the Oscars or the BAFTAs

British actor David Oyelowo will not be practicing his speech making for the Oscars either after his turn as Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma was not recognised in the Best Actor category. 

Sadly, Ralph Fiennes was another Brit who didn't get a nod for their critically-acclaimed performance, though his turn as Monsieur Gustave H. in Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel could win him a BAFTA.

Lorde was snubbed for Best Song for her track Yellow Flicker Beat from the movie The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One.

She had picked up a nomination at the Golden Globes but lost out to John Legend and Common's track, Glory, from the Selma soundtrack.

The LEGO Movie lost out on a nomination in the Best Animated Feature category, leaving Big Hero 6, The Box Trolls, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Song Of The Sea and Tale Of The Princess Kaguya hoping to win.

However it did get a nod for Best Original Song and director Philip Lord tweeted a picture of his own Oscar - made out of Lego.

'This is not a tragedy,' Lord wrote. 'Congrats to incredible crew and cast of The Lego Movie, who made a classic.'
