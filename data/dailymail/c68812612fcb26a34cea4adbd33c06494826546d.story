Perry Reeves faces three counts of statutory rape by an authority figure

A 30-year-old high school teacher was caught having sex with his 15-year-old student and tried to flee the scene after her boyfriend called the cops on him.

Perry Reeves, a first-year high school teacher in Alamo, Tennessee, failed to escape through a cornfield after running out the back door of his student’s home, where police deputies arrested him.

The Jackson Sun reported that authorities say Reeves had sex with his student in her home on three occasions.

The incidents occurred on June 6, June 16 and June 27, according to court documents. 

A grand jury indicted Reeves on three counts of statutory rape by an authority figure and three counts of aggravated statutory rape.

Reeves had just completed his first year teaching history and assistant coaching football at Crockett County High School at the time of his arrest, according to the Jackson Sun.

A Crockett County Sheriff's Lieutenant said Reeves posted a $25,000 bond and was released from jail on June 28.

Reeves was indicted this month.

His next court date is December 17.

Reeves was a first-year high school teacher at Crockett County High School in Alamo, Tennessee
