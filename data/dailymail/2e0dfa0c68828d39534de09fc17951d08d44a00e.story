Shortly after moving into their stunning Suffolk barn conversion, Bob and Nora Hutchinson were enjoying a rerun of the BBC TV show Lovejoy when their own living room suddenly appeared on the screen.

Roguish antique dealer Lovejoy, played by the actor Ian McShane, was kissing his girlfriend beneath  the distinctive vaulted ceiling of their six-bedroom home.

‘It was unmistakably our drawing room because of the beams,’ says Nora, 63. ‘Later we saw the camera pan out as Lovejoy drove off down our gravel drive and there was a shot of the house itself.’

Dramatic setting: The timber-clad converted Hall Barn, pictured, is set in idyllic 1.6-acre grounds, which include a pond, in Preston St Mary, Suffolk

This was the moment when the Hutchinsons discovered that their home had a starring role in a show that had always been one of their favourites. They had bought the house for £735,000 in 2006, several years after the television crews moved on.

The Sunday night staple, which ran for eight years from the late 1980s and regularly drew 15 million viewers at its peak, was set in East Anglia, and was mostly filmed around Suffolk and Essex.

The picture it painted of English country life was as much a part of its charm as Lovejoy himself sniffing out a valuable heirloom.

Hall Barn was the fictional home of auctioneer Charlotte, played by Caroline Langrishe, Lovejoy’s girlfriend in series five and six, which aired in 1993 and 1994.

It’s easy to see why the property appealed to the producers. Located in the sleepy village of Preston St Mary, two miles from the medieval town of Lavenham, it is full of interesting features, with red-brick fireplaces, stone floors and beamed doorways.

‘We later found out that the television crew virtually camped out in the village pub for two years because so much of the series was filmed in and around here,’ says Nora.

The barn itself dates from 1520 but a previous owner converted it into a home in 1989. With a red-brick and weather-boarded facade, it is set in idyllic 1.6-acre grounds, which include a pond, summerhouse and stables.

‘It was converted before building regulations were brought in restricting the number of windows, so it’s very light and bright, and has great height, which must have been perfect for filming,’ says Bob, 62, who sold his successful chain of opticians in 1999 and is now  a business consultant for firms including Specsavers.

The couple, who have both been married before and have six daughters and nine grandchildren between them, have spent about £100,000 on the property.

They converted the former coach-house into a luxurious master bedroom suite, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading on to the garden, and a roomy en suite bath and shower room. They also installed a Sonos sound system with built-in speakers in the drawing room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom and garden.

Bob and Nora have put the property on the market for £975,000 as they are downsizing. Estate agent Alex Davies, of David Burr, says prices in this region of Suffolk have steadily increased over the past couple of years but haven’t quite recovered to 2007/08 levels.

‘Property is moving and usually selling for the asking price,’ he adds.

He points out that the area is popular with retirees moving further out from London and Essex, although some younger buyers are prepared to brave the 90-minute commute to the capital from Stowmarket station.

The Hutchinsons spend almost half the year at their three-bedroom home in Florida, and have decided to look for a smaller house closer to Lavenham.
