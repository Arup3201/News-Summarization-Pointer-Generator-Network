Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard appears to have shrugged off the row about the Liberal Party's insulting menu, as she is pictured at a breakfast meeting with action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Miss Gillard and the former Californian Governor have teamed up to write a joint opinion piece to urge global action on climate change.

The British-born prime minster has week- this morning she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay.

Miss Gillard appeared relaxed and undaunted sharing a light breakfast with Hollywood legend Schawarzenegger as the unlikely pair collaborated on their article.

The joint piece, which has been published in News Limited newspapers, draws on the similarities between California and Australia.

The article reads: 'California and Australia have a lot in common - climate change threatens our fragile environments and aggravates serious bushfires, droughts and floods, which put our important agricultural industries at risk.

'Because of these similar challenges, even though we are leaders from different sides of the political spectrum, we strongly agree on two fundamental ideas - that taking action on climate change can no longer be delayed and that such actions can succeed beyond partisan politics.'

In a vulgar incident earlier this week it 
emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail',  
described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'.

Today Miss Gillard, who has attacked the Liberal Party for what she said was their sexist attitude to women, was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay.

Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser

Appearing on a radio show in Perth, Western Australia, 51-year-old Miss Gillard was asked outright if Mr Mathieson, 56, was gay because he was a hairdresser.

'That's absurd,' Miss Gillard told interviewer Howard Sattler on radio 6PR when he said he wanted to ask her about Mr Mathieson's sexuality.

But the interviewer was not going to drop the subject, after earlier asking the Labour leader about the sexist menu.

'But you hear it,' said Mr Sattler, quoting what people were saying: 'He must be gay, he's a hairdresser.'

Miss Gillard made it clear that she was not going to be drawn in to the rumours Mr Sattler said were being bandied about.

'I mean, Howard, I don't know if every silly thing that gets said is going to be repeated to me now,' she said.

To all the hairdressers out there, including the men who are listening, I don't think in life one can actually look at a whole profession full of different human beings and say "Gee, we know something about every one of those human beings."'

Mr Sattler reminded the Prime Minister that he had been promised a candid interview with her, asking: 'You can confirm that he's not (gay)?'

'Oh Howard, don't be ridiculous, of course he not,' said the British-born Prime Minister.

'But you're in a heterosexual relationship?' he pressed. 'That's all I'm asking.'

She replied: 'Howard, let me just bring you back to earth - you and I have just talked about me and Tim living at the lodge. We live there together as a couple, you know that.'

The astonishing interview had begun with Mr Sattler telling Miss Gillard that she had been the butt of rumours and snide jokes many times, to which she she said that was probably right.

When he asked if he could test a few out and she asked in what way, he said: 'Tim's gay.'

After telling the radio host that the suggestion was ridiculous she said: 'Yes, on the internet, you know, there are lots of, you know, what I've referred to in the past as nutjobs and I'm happy to use the expression again - people who peddle and circulate vile and offensive things.'

Bloggers later pointed out that the questions had put Miss Gillard off guard - she told Mr Sattler that the general election was on September 12 when it is actually being held on September 14.

Mr Mathieson is divorced with four adult children, three born during his marriage and one who he fathered in his late teens.

He began dating Miss Gillard in 2006 and has been her partner ever since.

trick'

Political observers said the dinner 
menu's contents had blunted the Liberal Party's attack on Miss Gillard's
 campaign to warn about about the threat of male dominance in government
 if the Liberals won the election, as the opinion polls are suggesting.

The dinner menu made its unsubtle attack on British-born Miss Gillard under the title of Moroccan Quail.

Liberal leader Tony Abbott was also quick to condemn the menu, calling it 'tawdry'.

'I think we should all be bigger and better than that,' he said.

Today Miss Gillard to have put the incident behind her appearing relaxed and undaunted as she met with Hollywood legend Schawarzenegger to collaborated on an article.

In 2006 as governor of California Schwarzenegger making it the first US state to impose limits on global warming gases.

One of Gillard's key policies since taking office has been the introduction of a carbon pollution tax.

The article emphasised the importance of carbon pricing in lowering emissions to less damaging levels and reducing climate change.

It read: 'This means we need to put a meaningful, global price on carbon pollution now.

'What the Industrial Revolution and the Information Technology Revolution have shown is that the people in regions which lead these transformations prosper the most and the soonest.

'It is the same with the Clean Energy Revolution.'
