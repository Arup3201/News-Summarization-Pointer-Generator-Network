President Obama’s reelection campaign launched Vice President Joe Biden’s Twitter feed two days ago, but the veep’s playful sense of humour has already taken centre stage.

The campaign staff running his Twitter feed posted two pictures of both Mr Obama and Mr Biden in the midst of a water gun battle.

In the first photo, President Obama is in a baseball cap and shorts, running around a pool and wielding an orange and white gun.

In the second, Mr Biden is taking aim at an unknown target while wearing sunglasses. It appears that he is at a children’s birthday party.

Mr Biden’s tweets – which are run by the Obama 2012 campaign staff, unless specifically noted – begin with several tweets of his schedule.

Then came the tweet with the Super Soaker photos. Along with the pictures, he writes: ‘Favourite Joe photos, volume one.’

The bizarre post is also accompanied by a picture of Mr Obama giving Mr Biden a high five in a gymnasium – coincidentally on the day after Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum announced he was dropping his bid for president.

Mr Biden, who hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania, has frequently been lampooned on Saturday Night Live for his ‘folksy’ mannerisms and absent-minded behaviour.

Played by Jason Sudeikis, the faux-politician is portrayed as zany and energetic.

Only yesterday, the internet took to scrutinising Mr Obama’s seemingly diminished frame. An image of him topping Drudge Report said under it that Mr Obama was ‘thin and wasting away.’

Eagle-eyed Twitter users were quick to come up with snarky comments. Slate’s John Dickerson responded: ‘The Secret Service lets (Obama) run around the pool!?!’

Reuters’ Ross Neumann took it one step further, incorporating the popular meme of Hillary Clinton texting with her sunglasses on, and writing: ‘For the last time, you are not Seal Team Six.'
