A surprise promise by David Cameron to rule out further defence cuts unravelled today, with Downing Street forced to admit spending will not rise until after 2016.

Travelling in Algeria, the Prime Minister told reporters military spending would rise in real terms after 2015.

But Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today insisted the promise was only that equipment spending would rise by one per cent a year, but other areas would be cut.

Downing Street today scrambled to clear up the confusion, insisting Mr Cameron's was a Tory party election pledge for beyond 2016.

However, in the imminent spending review for 2015-16, only the equipment budget would be protected.

During a historic trip to Algeria, the Prime Minister sought to quell a mounting backlash from Tory MPs and military top brass.

The turmoil came as the Ministry of Defence’s finances were once again 
called into question by the National Audit Office, Britain’s spending 
watchdog.

In Algeria Mr Cameron said he was keen to veto fresh cuts to avoid throwing the MoD into fresh financial turmoil.

An insider said the Prime Minister has not gone back on ‘anything he has said in the past about defence spending’.

Mr Cameron, who recently warned about a ‘generational struggle’ against Al Qaeda in the Sahara region, is the first serving British prime minister to visit Algeria since it gained independence in 1962.

In 2010, the Ministry of Defence was ordered to cut £4.7billion – or 8 per cent – from its budget. But speaking at the time, Mr Cameron promised ‘year on year real-terms growth in the defence budget in the years beyond 2015’.

The PM's decision to ringfence the defence budget sets the scene for a bloody Cabinet battle over the 2015-16 spending review

George Osborne has already agreed 
that the MoD’s equipment budget should rise by 1 per cent a year every 
year from 2015 to 2020.

Mr Hammond appeared to row back on PM's pledge to protect defence spending in interviews this morning.

'I think what the Prime Minister was 
referring to was the pledge that was made – which Treasury ministers 
have repeated – that the equipment plan, the part of the defence budget 
which funds equipment, will rise by 1% a year in real terms after 2015,'
 he told Sky News.

'And the Treasury has re-confirmed that commitment since the announcements in the Autumn Statement.

'So as far as the equipment plan is 
concerned – and that’s what we’re talking about today in this 
publication – we’re confident that the funding will be there through to 
the end of the decade.'

Kevan Jones, Labour’s shadow armed forces minister, said: 'Our forces deserve honesty. Cameron’s spinning is now unravelling.

'Our forces don’t want jam tomorrow and P45s today. They will judge ministers on their record.

'More cuts may be made to fund the shaky equipment plan and claims to have balanced the budget are woefully hollow.'

The Chancellor has announced that he wants to make a further £10billion cuts across Whitehall.

The move comes days after it was announced that a third round of 5,300 Army redundancies will be made in June.

Mr Hammond will today publish the department’s long-awaited equipment plan explaining how it would spend £160billion over the next decade on buying and maintaining military hardware such as submarines, warships, fighter jets and attack helicopters.

But a National Audit Office report on the equipment programme, published simultaneously, warned that the cash-strapped MoD had failed to get to grips with its budget. ‘We have a concern that there are still areas of risk to affordability,’ it said.

It pointed to an internal MoD review which concluded that the equipment plan faced a £12.5billion shortfall.
