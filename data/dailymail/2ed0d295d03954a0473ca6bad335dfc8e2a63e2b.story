A family had a lucky escape when their 4x4 plunged 20ft down an embankment after careering past traffic lights and through a safety barrier.

The Volvo XC90 was being driven through Lincoln by a 37-year-old woman carrying two children on board, who apparently lost control of the vehicle and drove down the steep slope into a row of back gardens.

The car destroyed the safety barrier and uprooted a tree before finally coming to rest on top of a basket of children's toys during the accident last week.

Crash: A 4x4 ended up in a back garden in Lincoln after smashing through two safety barriers

Carnage: The force of the Volvo XC90 left the mangled barriers dangling into the garden

Despite the destruction caused by the terrifying incident last Monday afternoon, no one was hurt in the crash.

It is unclear how the driver, who has not been identified, lost control of her car.

Neighbours described their horror at witnessing the accident, which was 'like an earthquake' - and said they were shocked that more people were not injured.

Lucy MacKenzie had left the garden outside her home with her son Tyler just minutes before the crash.Â 

Recovery: Workers had to lift the car out of the garden with a crane after it tumbled down an embankment

Escape: The 37-year-old woman who was driving the car with her two children in was unharmed

Written off: The front of the car was utterly mangled after its 20ft fall last Monday afternoon

'I was upstairs when I heard a noise and I just looked out of window and saw the car coming into the garden,' the 23-year-old said.

'I'm shocked, but relieved that no one was in the garden at the time. Luckily, I was not feeling very well so I had gone upstairs with Tyler to watch a DVD.

'I definitely think there needs to be a better barrier between the road and our gardens.'

Scene: The communal garden where the car fell was littered with debris following the accident

Relief: Andrew and Lisa Cowley with their one-year-old daughter Bethany, whose toys the car landed on

Her next-door neighbour Andrew Cowley, who also has access to the communal garden, said: 'I was in the kitchen and it felt as if the whole house was shaking, almost like an earthquake.

'I wasn't sure what was going on. I heard children crying and went out and saw a car had ended up in our gardens.'

His wife Lisa, who was out at the time with their one-year-old daughter Bethany, added: 'It was the tree that stopped the car from hitting the house.

'This could have been a tragedy on another level. I think there needs to be a secure barrier on the road made out of concrete.'
