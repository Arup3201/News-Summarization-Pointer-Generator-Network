Snow - The Double Life Of A World War II Spy tells how the journey of Arthur Owens (pictured) into the world of spying began when he walked into the Germany embassy in Belgium in 1935

When MI5 first set eyes upon him, Arthur Owens was breezily described as 'an underfed Cardiff type'.

But the Welsh electrical engineer was a complex man who led an extraordinary life during World War II becoming Britain's first double agent and helping to crack Germany's Enigma military codes, a new book reveals.

Given the codename Johnny O'Brien by his paymasters in Berlin, he helped MI5 capture numerous Nazi spies, including all those dropped by parachute or boat in England in 1940.

Snow - The Double Life Of A World War II Spy by Nigel West and Madoc Roberts - tells how his journey into the world of spying began when he walked into the Germany embassy in Belgium in 1935.

Mired in debt after failing to sell a method for improving batteries he went there in the hope they would be interested in his invention.

'He walked into the German Embassy as an inventor but he came out as the German spy "Johnny O'Brien",' co-author Madoc Roberts told thisissouthwales.

'As they secretly rearmed themselves in preparation for war, the Germans were keen to know how prepared Britain was against attack. With his contacts in the military in Britain and his cover as a battery inventor, Arthur Owens was exactly what the Germans were looking for.'

But his activities eventually became known to MI5 and it was then that he agreed to work for them thereby becoming their first double agent. His codename became Snow, a partial anagram of his surname Owens.

Patricia Owens, his daughter from his first marriage, went on to become a Hollywood actress who starred in the 1958 sci-fi classic The Fly. She also appeared in films alongside Marlon Brando and James Mason

Interviewed about his father, Graham White said: 'I would say the only side he was on was his own side. He was very much for himself.'

The Welsh nationalist was seen by Berlin as being a key part of building up their spy network in Britain and furthermore the Germans saw nationalists as useful in organising a future invasion. As a result, all agents sent to the UK were ordered to get in touch with 'Johnny'.

This then gave MI5 the edge in the espionage war and enabled them to give those they captured a stark choice of either working as double agents or facing the firing squad. These agents were then used to feed false information back to Berlin.

Owens became wealthy with his activities but MI5 were never wholly convinced by his loyalty. The book reveals how they also knew that after drinking he would say he loathed the English establishment because his father had been cheated out of money for ordnance he invented in the Great War.

To this end they sent a minder - a Swansea policeman - with him when he went on a daring mission to Hamburg to meet the city's head of the secret service known as Dr Rantzau.

The Germans were keen to find a drop-off point for weapons along the South Wales coast and MI5, keen to keep their cover as real as possible, sent the men to the Gower peninsula where they found a beach for U-Boots to deliver arms.Â 

The book also reveals the men were told by their German handlers that anyone prepared to fly a Spitfire back to Occupied Europe would be richly rewarded.

The end to his spying activities came in 1941 when Owens was ordered to go to Lisbon, in Portugal, by Dr Rantzau where he was immediately accused of being a double agent. The book says he admitted it but then, mysteriously, was allowed to return to England where he told MI5 what had happened.

Already suspicious of him, they became wary of whose side he was really on and interned him for the rest of the war.

Interviewed about his father, Graham White said: 'I would say the only side he was on was his own side. It looked like he just changed sides with the prevailing wind. He was very much for himself.'

He said he had no idea about his father's extraordinary past until after he died and his mother told him.

Furthermore, he found out that his step-sister Patricia Owens was the Hollywood actress who starred in the 1958 sci-fi classic The Fly.

She would also go on to star alongside Marlon Brando and James Mason.

Fearful that her father would still be seen as a traitor she kept their relationship quiet.

Mr White said he should have realised there was something odd about his father when as a youngster he walked through his father's shop with a friend carrying a flag which had a swastika on it.

'He went ballistic when he saw this. He said "Are you trying to get me locked up?!". We did not understand what he meant at the time but looking back on it now I see the significance.'

His father died in 1957 and is buried in an unmarked grave outside Wexford in southern Ireland.

When asked what kind of a man his father was, he replied: 'A very interesting person, whatever your loyalties or politics are. He wasn't your average Joe.'
