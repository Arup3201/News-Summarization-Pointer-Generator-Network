Four live mortar bombs were intercepted by police in Northern Ireland minutes before being launched, according to a senior police officer.

They were discovered in the back of a van which had part of its roof cut back as part of plans to bomb a police station in Londonderry.

Chief Supt Stephen Cargin said the bombs could have caused mass murder.

Three men, all in their 30s, were arrested - two at the scene. One was detained in searches afterwards.

The officer said the mortars were 'primed and ready to go'.

'These were people who were mindless, totally reckless, willing to drive four live mortar bombs through a built-up area with no regard to the people, the residents and the families living in the area,' he said.

'We believe those devices were destined for one of the police stations here in the city.Â 

'I have no doubt they would have caused mass fatalities. They were on their way to a target. These are crude home-made devices. There is no way the people who planned their attack would have known they would have hit their target.'

It is understood one of the men had 
been on a motorcycle following the van when police intercepted it near 
the city centre last night.

More than 100 homes had to be evacuated in the Brandywell area.

Officers intercepted the van in the 
Letterkenny Road area of Londonderry last night, prompting the 
evacuation as army bomb disposal experts were scrambled to the scene.

The roof of the van is believed to have been removed and the mortars mounted on the back in preparation for an imminent attack.

A 37-year-old man was detained today following a search of a property in the city, police said.

A PSNI spokesman said: 'Approximately 100 homes have been evacuated and army technical officers are at the scene.

'Two males aged 35 and 37 have been arrested and taken to Antrim serious crime suite where they are helping with inquiries.

'Detectives from PSNI serious crime branch are dealing with the incident and are linking it with dissident republican activity.'

Alert: Residents gathered to watch forensic investigators examine the scene in the Letterkenny Road area of the city, where around 100 homes were evacuated

The incident comes just days before a by-election to replace Martin McGuinness as MP for Mid Ulster, after Stormont's Deputy First Minister resigned his Westminster seat as part of his party's policy to end double-jobbing in politics.

The four contenders for Thursday's by-election are Sinn Fein Assembly Member Francie Molloy, independent Nigel Lutton, the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Patsy McGlone and Eric Bullick of the cross-community Alliance Party.
