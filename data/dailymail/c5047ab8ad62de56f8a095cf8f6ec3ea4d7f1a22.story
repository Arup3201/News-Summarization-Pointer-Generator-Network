Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow today – after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked his leadership and questioned whether they could vote for him.

Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'

His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband.

The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election.

According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29.

This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one.

Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent.

Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories.

Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government.

'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.'

Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'

The pair dismissed the idea of hosting a political programme.

Mr Donnelly: 'The problem is people want to watch people they like. It's very hard to make politicians likeable.'

Mr McPartlin: 'If you're a family in Middlesbrough and you're watching grown men arguing on the TV, you're not going to know what the parties stand for, just two men trying to get the better of each other. I can't stand it. No wonder people don't relate.'

The Geordie pair have previously opened up about politics.

Mr McPartlin has previously admitted his decision to vote Tory at the last election would make his family in the North East 'very angry'.
