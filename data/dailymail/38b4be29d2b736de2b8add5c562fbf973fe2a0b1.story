F3 racing driver Jonathan Legris, 26, has been charged with assisting an offender - his father, Pierre Legris, 60, appeared in court today accused of murdering hsi wife, nurse Rui Li , 44

The husband of a nurse who was found dead in the boot of a car has appeared in court accused of her murder.

Pierre Legris, 60, appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court this morning charged with killing 44-year-old Rui Li, who worked at Poole Hospital.

Legris, who spoke with a heavy French accent to confirm his name, date of birth and address, is accused of murdering his wife at his home in Bournemouth, and will appear before Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday.

Legris’s 26-year-old son, F3 racing driver Jonathan Legris, also from Bournemouth, has been charged with assisting an offender and will appear before magistrates in the town on 17 June.

Ms Li's 18-year-old daughter, Lu Yao, watched the proceedings supported by other family members at court this morning.

She was the last person to have seen her mother alive, at their home in Bournemouth on the 
evening of 23 May.  Ms Li had been captured on CCTV earlier that day as she 
drove out of the hospital car park in her Porsche Boxter car after 
finishing work.

She was 
reported missing by her mother last Tuesday, and officers discovered Ms 
Li’s body 'concealed within a silver Fiat Punto' in north Bournemouth, 
four and a half miles away from her home on Friday night.

Detectives said Ms Li moved to the UK from China a decade ago and had worked at the hospital since 2009.

They said she lived 'quite a private personal life' and officers were trying to build a picture of her lifestyle.

A
 Dorset Police spokesman said: 'We still very much want to hear from 
anyone who may have any information about what happened to Rui Li.

'In
 particular we would like anyone with information about the movements of
 two vehicles - a silver Fiat Punto with registration plate W887 PDL and
 a large white Ford Transit van with registration plate Y491 GFT - 
between 24 May and 28 May to contact police.'

After Ms Li went missing, colleagues from Poole Hospital said: 'Rui was a big character in our small close-knit team.

'Funny and so unique, she was totally reliable, professional and conscientious to a tee. She is terribly missed by all of us.

'Her nature was gentle and serene, and that is part of the reason why we and the patients love her so much.'
