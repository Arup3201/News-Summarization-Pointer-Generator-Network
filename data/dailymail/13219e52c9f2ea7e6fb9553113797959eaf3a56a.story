A 28-year-old high school chemistry teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with one of her 17-year-old students.

Jessica Deck, 28, allegedly had sex once in the past month with the teen, whom classmates described as a good student and athlete at Sun Valley High School in Indian Trail, North Carolina.

Authorities launched an investigation after a school resource officer received a tip about the alleged incident and contacted the sheriff's office.

Deck, who 
teaches honors chemistry and physics at the school, was 
suspended without pay by the Union County Schools following her arrest 
last week, WBTV reported.

Arrest: Jessica Deck, 28, was arrested last week after allegedly having sex with one of her teenage students

Arrest information indicates that she was arrested at the Union County Public Schools building.

She has been charged with indecent liberties with a student.

Authorities will not say if the student and teacher were involved in a longer term relationship, or if the encounter was an isolated incident. They would also not say where they allegedly had sex.

Students at the school said they were shocked by the reports.

'It hit 
everybody like a brick wall,' Ethan Parker, a junior and in Deck's 
chemistry class, told WBTV. 'It was not something you would 
expect.'

Accused: She was arrested and suspended from her science teacher job after a tip was sent to her school

Scene: Deck has worked at Sun Valley High School in Indian Trail, North Carolina since August 2012

He continued: 'I think they're both good people. He's a good kid. He's smart. He's a good athlete. She's a good teacher. She's really smart.'

Authorities said the investigation is ongoing.

'There's the obvious line that teachers 
in a position of trust, authority over students - they just can't cross 
that line at all,' Union County Sheriff's Office Captain Ronnie Whitaker said.

The age of consent in North Carolina is 16.

Deck, who has worked for the county since
 August 2012, was released from the Union County Jail on Thursday night 
after posting bond and she is due in court on Friday.
