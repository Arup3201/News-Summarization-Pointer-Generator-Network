Glen Turner was shot and killed on a property near Moree in northern NSW over an environmental dispute

The 79-year-old Moree wheat farmer accused of the shooting murder of a state government worker has been hit with two new charges and will remain behind bars.

Ian Robert Turnbull was refused bail after two further charges were laid against him at Moree Local Court on Tuesday.

Glen Turner was allegedly shot dead by Mr Turnbull on Talga Lane, near Moree in north-west NSW, about 5.40pm on July 29.

Mr Turnbull is accused of also assaulting Mr Turner's colleague Robert Strange on the same day, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The farmer had allegedly stopped his car next to the environmental compliance officers, who were both carrying out an on site inspection, before he armed himself with a rifle and opened fire.

Mr Turner was allegedly shot several times before he was found by police. Mr Turnbull was arrested five hours later at a nearby property.

Mr Turnbull will return to court in September.

Mr Turner was working for the department and is survived by his wife Alison and their two children, aged nine and 10.

The state government worker was shot as he served a notice to an elderly man accused of illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area

Mr Turnbull had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area.

The Land and Environment Court had ordered the farmer to remediate the land after it found the Native Title Vegetation Act had been breached.

In the wake of the tragedy, Mr Turnbull's family hope to see the legislation changed so farmers have more control over how they clear their land after persistent calls from farming communities.

The family member said Mr Turnbull was the 'respected elder' who people into the community turned too and not a 'hermit'.

'He was out in the community - he was helping to build old people's homes, he was collecting trampolines at school fetes, he did Meals on Wheels,' the family member told The Daily Telegraph.

'He has held this all in, he has crumbled, he has tried to carry this all to himself.'

The Turnbulls said the tragedy had catastrophic impacts for both families and offered their condolences to the Turners.

They added that the death was not right and Mr Turner's children had been robbed of their father.Â 

Police and paramedics were called to a Croppa Creek property about 55 kilometres north of Moree on the Newell Highway, where they found the body of the victim late on Tuesday afternoon.

A post-mortem will be held to determine exactly how the 51-year-old died. He was informing Mr Turnbull that there would be a formal inspection of his property in relation to the suspected illegally clearing of vegetation before the incident occurred.

Another worker was with the victim when he was shot, a department source who did not wish to be named said. The other worker is understood to be in shock but is otherwise uninjured.

Friends of the alleged shooter have described Mr Turnbull as even-tempered but admitted the whole town knew that he had cleared too many trees.

The wheat farmer owned five properties in the area and the shooting took place about a kilometre from one of those.

Moree Plains Shire mayor Katrina Humphries said the shooting highlighted the volatile issue of land clearing in northern NSW.

Environmental issues including land clearing and coal seam gas exploration have been a source of frustration in the rural community, she said.

'This is why I say, and I am not saying it flippantly and I mean it, I am not surprised this has happened,' she said.

'Because I know people have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This is their life and this is their livelihood,' Ms Humphries said.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce agreed with these comments, and said this was a tragedy but not an isolated incident, just the worst one.

Northern NSW ecologist Phil Spark said the farmer had cleared about 100 hectares of land.

'And a lot of that is koala habitat so that has been a real conflict between conservation and this farmer having the right to clear his land,' he told ABC Radio.

The NSW Public Service Association says the tragedy highlights the need for better risk assessment.

'The protection of the environment is an issue that generates great passion with strong feelings on both sides of the argument,' acting general secretary Steve Turner said in a statement.

NSW Environment Minister Rob Stokes said he was deeply saddened by the death.
