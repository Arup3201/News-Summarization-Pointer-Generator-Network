A couple who met on the ITV dating show Take Me Out are set to tie the knot after finding true love on the fictional Isle of Fernando's.

Gemma Gordon, 27, bagged herself a date with personal trainer Gavin Ellis, 28, after impressing her groom-to-be by performing 30 press-ups in a minute on the program hosted by Paddy McGuiness.

The couple, who appeared on the fifth series of the show in February 2013, are among the first contestants to say 'I do.'

They're also expecting a baby together next month.

Each episode sees single men trying to impress 30 single girls, eventually selecting their favourites from those who still have their lights left on. 

Miss Gordon caught her groom-to-be's eye, and was then pitted against another girl to perform a fitness challenge to win Mr Ellis's affections.

She managed to beat the other contestant by performing 30 press-ups in a minute, and winning herself a date. 

The pair were whisked away to the Isle of Fernando's  where they found love and moved in together in Chorley, Lancashire, a few months later.

Mr Ellis tweeted a picture of his fiances engagement ring after she accepted his proposal 

Mr Ellis, who is a part time guitar instructor said: 'There were 30 girls, but Gemma really stood out to me.'  

After the pair had been on their date, Mr Ellis admitted that he was 'smitten' and said: 'She is a beautiful girl and as soon as I got to know her we just clicked and I felt like there was something special there.'

Mr Ellis, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, proposed to his bride-to-be in April last year but the couple kept it a secret until now.

The couple also shared an ultra sound image of their baby that is due just weeks before they tie the knot

Makers of Take Me Out sent the happy couple a congratulatory tweet after learning of their engagement

With the return of the show for its seventh season last weekend, they took the opportunity to announce their happy news. 

Just a few weeks before their wedding in March this year, the couple will be expecting the arrival of their first child together - a baby girl.

Gemma's daughters, Grace, eight and Olivia, five, will be bridesmaids.

All eyes will be on whether Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness, who hails from nearby Horwich, will be guest on the big day. 

Last August contestants Adele Vellacott and Dave Cobain, who ended up going on separate dates when they appeared on the program in 2012, became the first couple to walk down the aisle.
