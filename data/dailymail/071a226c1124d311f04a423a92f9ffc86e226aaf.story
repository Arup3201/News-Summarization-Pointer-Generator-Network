Senator Al Franken has sent a letter to Apple’s chief executive highlighting ‘substantial’ security concerns about fingerprint recognition technology on its iPhone 5S. 

The iPhone 5S, which went on sale today, includes a fingerprint sensor that lets users touch the phone's home button with their finger to unlock it, rather than enter a passcode.

Apple claims its scanner, known as Touch ID, is ‘one of the best passwords in the world.’

But Senator Franken said that while a password can be kept a secret and changed if it's hacked, fingerprints are permanent and left on everything a person touches.

In a letter to Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, the Minnesota Democrat asked for more clarity on security questions.

‘If someone hacks your password, you can change it – as many times as you want,’ said Senator Franken, in his letter.

‘You can’t change your fingerprints. You have only ten of them. And you leave them on everything you touch; they are definitely not a secret.’

Apple claims this kind of technology boosts security for users.

It added that the fingerprint data is stored on the phone in a place that's inaccessible to other apps and to Apple's remote servers.

Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now'

Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger.

Users can 'train' their iPhone to 
read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home 
button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire 
crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7
 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

All fingerprint information is 
encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip.

The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.

Senator Franken said that, unlike a string of numbers, a fingerprint uniquely identifies its owner.

‘Let me put it this way,’ he said. ‘If hackers get a hold of your thumbprint, they could use it to identify and impersonate you for the rest of your life.’

Apple is yet to issue an official response to Senator Franken, but it has published a support document on its website outlining the security features of Touch ID.

‘Touch ID does not store any images of your fingerprint. It stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint,’ it said.

‘It isn’t possible for your actual fingerprint image to be reverse-engineered from this mathematical representation.’

‘Your fingerprint data is never accessed by iOS or other apps, never stored on Apple servers, and never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else,’ it added.

Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire-based materials. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its iPhone 5S, pictured, and to protect the cameras on its latest models. Rumours now claim Apple could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens

Apple's Phil Schiller, pictured, explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip, and not online. Yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere

Even before the new iPhone 5S was released, a group of hackers pooled their funds to offer a bounty of over £10,000, bottles of booze and other prizes, for the first person that can crack the iPhone 5S’s Touch ID fingerprint sensors. 

IsTouchIDhackedyet.com, the creation of security researcher Nick DePetrillo, said it is hoping to help Apple identify bugs that it may have missed.

Security engineer Charlie Miller said it could take fewer than two weeks for a smart hacker to get around the new lock.

Among those getting ready for the hacking contest is David Kennedy, a former U.S. Marine Corps cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in Iraq and now runs his own consulting firm, TrustedSec LLC.

Kennedy said he needs to examine the new iPhone to figure out how to best attempt an attack.

He said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data, or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom-built device that would impersonate Apple's fingerprint reader.

He added that it might be possible to lift a user's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it.

The Touch ID sensor is built into the premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or PIN.

Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said: 'Half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords. [Touch ID] is an easier and more fun alternative.

'It uses key you have with you everywhere you go. Your finger.'

It works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger.

A user can 'train' their iPhone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button, the phone is unlocked.

Touch ID can also replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books.

It uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-res image scan and the Touch ID software in iOS 7 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not.

Apple said it is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now.' 

Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud.
