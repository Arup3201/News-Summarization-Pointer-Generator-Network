The nine-day-old baby who died after being given infected feed through a hospital drip was a twin and his brother is still in hospital, it emerged yesterday.

Yousef Al-Kharboush died on Sunday after contracting a deadly bacterial infection from the intravenous fluid at St  Thomas’ Hospital in London.

His father, Raaid Hassan Sakkijha, yesterday told of his agony at seeing his son suffer. He called for the  contaminated feed blamed for his son’s death to be withdrawn from production so no other children would fall victim to the same fate.

New tragedy: A second baby fed on a contaminated drip died today, ten days after nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died in the premature unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London

Hours after he spoke out, it emerged 
that three more babies had been infected – bringing the total number of 
vulnerable infants struck down with blood poisoning to 21 across ten 
hospitals in England.

This is despite the pharmaceutical company that
 manufactured the product, ITH Pharma, insisting on Thursday that there 
was ‘no reason’ for any more families to be concerned because the rogue 
batch had been withdrawn.

At a pre-inquest review at Southwark 
Coroner’s Court yesterday, Mr Sakkijha described his agony at watching 
as his tiny son deteriorated and then died last Sunday. His surviving 
baby, Abdullilah, remains in hospital.

Officials confirmed a baby at Peterborough City Hospital has tested positive test for Bacillus cereus

A baby at Basildon Hospital in Essex has a suspected case of the bug which has not been confirmed

‘My son has just died and I 
don’t want more children to die,’ he said. ‘If you look at Yousef, he 
was dying because of this product. If you could see Yousef, he was 
suffering. He died because of this.’

The twins were placed on life 
support after being born eight weeks premature at St Thomas’ on May 23. 
But Yousef, who weighed just 1lb 9oz at birth, fell seriously ill on May
 30 when infected with the bacterium bacillus cereus, apparently as a 
result of being given the contaminated feed. He died two days later. Mr 
Sakkijha, who also has two older children aged seven and ten, asked 
health officials whether investigations into the contamination would 
consider if any children could be affected when they grow older.

‘How do we know that the solution will not affect babies at a later stage, maybe after one or two years?’ he said.

‘How can you guarantee this will not happen? Is that part of the investigations?’

He said he hoped that the inquiries into his son’s death would save other children.

‘I
 was hoping to hear this product would be completely stopped from 
production until they make sure that ... no other babies are being 
contaminated,’ he said.

Karen Hamling, the managing director of 
London-based firm ITH Pharma, said further batches would not be supplied
 until investigations are complete. ‘We are co-operating with all of our
 regulatory  bodies because we want to ensure something like this never 
happens again,’ she told the hearing.

It was announced yesterday that
 three new cases of infection had been found at Stoke Mandeville 
Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in  
London, and Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
