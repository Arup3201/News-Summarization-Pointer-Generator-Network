Jessica McDivitt, 26, was hit by a truck in December as she walked home from work

A family who wanted to carry out their daughter's request of being an organ donor have found out it is not possible because doctors have discovered she also had breast cancer.

Jessica McDivitt, 26, was hit by a truck in December as she walked home from work in the town of Niagara, New York. 

She was taken to hospital with severe head and body injuries.

And days later her family were told she was brain dead.

They decided to switch off her life-support machine and donate her organs - her mother Mildred say: 'It's what Jessica wanted.'

But they then received a call saying the organs could not be donated as Jessica had breast cancer.

The news left the family reeling as neither Jessica or her family knew she had the cancer.

'They found a lump in her breast, and it turned out to be breast cancer,' Jessica's mother told WKBW.

'It was devastating. We had no idea, no idea.'

Although it is possible for people who have had cancer to donate their organs, this usually only happens if there is a long cancer-free interval before the organ donation.

At present the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), does not recommend accepting organs from people with 'actively spreading cancer.' 

According to cancer.org, this means that most people recently diagnosed with cancer cannot donate organs, but it is 'okay to accept organs from donors with primary brain tumors that have not spread beyond the brain stem.' 

Jessica's mother and sister (pictured) were heartbroken when they found out her organs could not be donated because she had breast cancer 

The driver of the truck was not charged on the scene, but was driving without a registration.

Town of Niagara Police Chief H. James Suitor told The Buffalo News, the road where Jessica was hit is dimly lit and there are no sidewalks.

He said the the driver of the pickup, Fateen Abdellatis, of North Tonawanda, stopped and was questioned at the scene - he told the police did not see Jessica. 

He was charged at the scene with having an unregistered motor vehicle and the Niagara County Sheriff's accident investigation unit is now handling the case.  

Jessica's funeral is planned for Wednesday - a Go Fund Me account has been set up to help her family pay for the $10,000 funeral costs.

He hit her so hard she was knocked right out of her shoes and the truck looked like it hit a tree. She was mercy flighted to ECMC where she fought for 5 days but with no chance of survival the family decided to donate her organs. 

She is survived by her loving mother, sister & older brother. Her father passed away when she was very young. No one was prepared for this sudden tragedy. Her birthday would have been this Saturday, January 3rd.'
