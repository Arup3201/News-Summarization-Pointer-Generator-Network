Three drones flew up to 10,000 feet above the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and the barges on the water at Sydney's fireworks display

Three drones captured exclusive footage of the spectacular fireworks above Sydney's Harbour on New Year's Eve this year, for the first time ever.

Each drone, fitted with six high definition cameras, captured footage of the fireworks being emitted from the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and the barges on the water from up to 1000 feet.

The 360-degree footage was featured live across ABC's broadcast of the event and on Telstra's YouTube stream.

Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, told the ABC earlier in the day: 'Those images will be beamed to a billion people around the world'.

'Our New Year's Eve team and pyrotechnic experts are busy putting the finishing touches on tonight's displays, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us.'

'If you're staying at home, tune in to our fantastic broadcasts, which will include never-before-seen drone footage of the fireworks – giving you the chance to be part of the event without having to leave the house.'

Ms Moore revealed that drones would not be the only new innovative technology used on the night via her Twitter account. 

'For the first time we're projecting your tweets on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Use #SydNYE to take part,' She tweeted on Wednesday.

Thousands of people streamed into Sydney's CBD in anticipation of the evening's spectacular fireworks display, with at least 1.6 million Sydneysiders  filling the Harbour.

The harbour dazzled onlookers as 50 vessels carrying over 8,000 people erupted in light shortly after the first round of fireworks at 9pm.

At 12pm, the queue to enter Mrs Macquarie's point, considered by many to offer the best view of the Harbour, stretched back for hundreds of metres.

As of 3pm, Mrs Macquaries Point, Tarpeian Precint, the Sydney Opera House and Mary Booth had all been closed, reported The Australian.

Drones were not the only innovative technology used on the night: Tweets with the hashtag #SydNYE were projected onto the Harbour Bridge for the first time
