Football players who suffer concussion should only be allowed back on the pitch after being examined by an independent doctor, say medics.

The proposal backs the world players’ union FIFPro, which criticised FIFA over its handling of head injuries during the World Cup and in particular Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira overruling his team doctors’ advice to be substituted.

In an editorial published in The Lancet Neurology, medics say that FIFA needs to get its house in order before the next World Cup: ‘Changes are clearly needed to protect athletes.’

The doctors say players must be taken off if there is any suspicion of head injury as it has been linked to dementia and other problems in later life.

Pereira continued playing in the game which saw his Uruguay side beat England “'after a blow to the head that left him in an apparent state of concussion.'

As a result FIFPro called on FIFA to 'conduct a thorough investigation into its own competition concussion protocol which failed to protect' the Uruguayan.

It called for 'a review of the laws of the game so that a player with a suspected concussion can be temporarily replaced whilst being diagnosed.'

It stressed: 'The World Cup must set the standard for player health and safety to educate the international football community.

'Medical evidence shows that a person faces the risk of very serious brain injury, or worse, if he or she suffers a severe head trauma from a concussive blow.

'Football is awash with incidents in which players suffer potentially concussive blows to the head and stay on the pitch. In Pereira’s case, he demanded to play on while overruling advice from Uruguay’s team physician for him to be immediately substituted.

'FIFPro understands that in the heat of the moment, faced by the pressures of such an important international stage, many players would react in this way, but there are times when the players also need protection from making any rash decisions.

'Furthermore, FIFPro states any sideline concussion assessment must not be conducted solely by a national team physician.'

It said if there is any suspicion of injury the only safe thing would be to take players off as a range of symptoms can last for weeks or months afterwards and has been linked to dementia in later life.

It said: 'Cerebral concussion is the most common form of sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and there is growing recognition of the lasting effects of mild TBI.

'A range of symptoms such as headache and dizziness can continue for weeks or even months after a concussion; the causes of post-concussion syndrome are unclear and do not seem to correlate with the severity of injury.'

Medics said the long-term consequences of repeated mild TBI have been recognised for some time in the boxing world where symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), including dementia, appears years or decades after brain trauma.

Despite the collision, Pereira refused to leave the field and carried on playing for the rest of the match

The editorial called for better education to prevent, recognise and respond to the effects of mild head injuries in sport while more research into the short and long-term effects of mild TBI was needed.

It added: 'Concussion signs and symptoms are not necessarily sensitive indicators of brain injury and we know that these symptoms can pass quickly even when neurological damage remains.

'Advanced neuroimaging and biomarkers are needed to diagnose and monitor CTE - characterised by progressive tauopathy and neurodegeneration - during life.

'Gives us hope that when teams gather in four year’s time for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, football and other sports will feel a safer place for athletes of all ages.'
