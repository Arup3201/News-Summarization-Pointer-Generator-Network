Forget garden tools and snow shovels, a trio of designers believes many of your household chores can be completed using a somewhat unlikely device - a flamethrower. 

The petrol-powered $699 (£466) XM42 shoots streams of flaming fuel up to 25 feet (7.6 metres) and its creators claim this can be used to clear snow, eliminate weeds and kill insects. 

And despite the potential dangers of such a device, the technology is legal and free to use across most of the US.

The XM42 was built by Cincinnati-based Ion Productions, run by Chris Byars, Tony Sroka and Jim Stewart. 

It is currently a prototype and the firm plans to launch an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the finished model on Monday. 

Once the ignition is pressed, flames are fired at the press of a button between 20ft (6 metres) and 25ft (7.6 metres) from the nozzle.

It runs on 87 octane gasoline, which is available directly from gas stations across the US. 

There are generally no restrictions on flamethrower ownership in the United States. 

There are generally no restrictions on flamethrower ownership in the United States. 

However, California and Maryland both have legislation regarding the devices. 

In California people must get a licence to use flamethrowers, and unlicensed possession of 'any non-stationary and transportable device designed or intended to emit or propel a burning stream of combustible or flammable liquid a distance of at least 10ft' is punishable with jail or a fine of up to $10,000. 

That said, the firm said anyone interested in buying the XM42 should check with local laws before ordering and it is their 'responsibility to understand and abide by all regulations.'

'It's designed to be safe when used properly,' said the firm. 

'We strongly encourage using the XM42 outdoors away from others and away from anything that could be accidentally set on fire.
