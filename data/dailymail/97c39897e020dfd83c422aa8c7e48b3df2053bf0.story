Victim: April Taylor, 31, was stung 40 times last Tuesday and died three days later in a Utah hospital

An amateur beekeeper with a 6-year-old son has died after what appears to be a fatal allergic reaction to 40 stings.

April Taylor was wearing gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family's back yard in Willard, Utah.

Those precautions did not cover her entirely, however, as many beekeepers regularly wear full suits and high boots to insure that they are entirely covered when they interact with the insects.

Mrs Taylor, 31, came into her house on Tuesday May 13 and showed her husband Zac how she had been stung 30 or 40 times.

He told the Deseret News that she said she seemed fine but later that day she went back outside and he found her passed out.

She was rushed to the local hospital but died three days later at Ogden Regional Medical Center.

'We all started thinking, "Well, how did this happen? … Killer bees or what? But I guess after she had got stung, her husband called the beekeeper, and he came and figured out there was no queen bee in the hive,"' Zak Taylor's uncle Bruce Vail told the paper.

'He said if there's no queen bee in the hive, they get really protective of their hive and they just swarmed her.'

According to her Facebook page, Mrs Taylor also suffered from multiple sclerosis.

Hobby: Mrs Taylor, seen with her husband of 11 years Zak Taylor, was a hairdresser by trade but kept bees in her backyard

Tragic: The couple has a 6-year-old son named Lux (pictured with his face blurred because of his age)

'Just a free spirit, nice girl, good mother,' Mr Vail said.

'They just swarmed her, it was a freak thing.'

Agriculture officials are investigating the incident, and have not yet been able to determine if it was an official attack.

'We're not certain that this was an attack. We feel this is a stinging event,' Larry Lewis from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food told KSL.

The concern is whether or not the fatal stings were a result of honeybees being cross-bred with Africanized bees which are generally more defensive and aggressive than the typically-docile bees found across the United States.

'Anytime someone is stung and passes away, that's a serious event,' Mr Lewis said.

Left behind: Zak Taylor, pictured with their son, said that he saw his wife's sings but said she seemed fine and it was only later when he found her passed out in their backyard that he called an ambulance

'We want to know exactly what happened and whether they were European honeybees, or Africanized, or any kind of percentage of Africanized bees. It’s unlikely that it’s Africanized.'

According to Boston Children's Hospital, about two million people in the United States are allergic to bee stings and about 100 people die every year as a result of the stings.

April and Zak Taylor were married in 2002 and have a 6-year-old son named Lux.

Home: The bees were stored in the Taylor's backyard (their home pictured in 2012)

According to her obituary, April was a licensed hairdresser who worked out of her home and a local barber shop.

She graduated from Box Elder High School in 2001 and later attended Bridgerland Cosmetology School.

Her hobbies included camping, fishing, gardening, and attending Renaissance Faires.

Her funeral will be held on Wednesday in Brigham City.
