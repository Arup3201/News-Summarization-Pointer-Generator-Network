Wayne Routledge has signed a one-year contract extension at Swansea, tying him to the club until 2018.

The winger has reignited his career since joining the Welsh club in 2011, with Roy Hodgson understood to have had an eye on the 29-year-old when he visited the Liberty Stadium for Swansea's 1-0 defeat against Southampton on Saturday.

Manager Garry Monk said: 'We've just had confirmation that he signed an extension to 2018. He thoroughly deserves it.

'His commitment to his club and how he's been, he's found a home, found somewhere he can be himself and bring out the player we now see week in week out. He's an experienced professional and what he brings the squad is very valuable.'

Commenting on how the former England Under 21 international has improved at his ninth club, Monk added: 'His experience is invaluable to players. He's been a around at a lot of top clubs, seen a lot of things.

'He has to trust you first before he opens up but his vast experience means when he does is very interesting.

'He'll admit himself a little bit he rebelled at times as a youngster but I think he never clicked at clubs where he felt he could express himself. Perhaps he was unsure of what he was capable of, but here he's had that freedom and guidance to be better. He does extras in training, he wants to improve all the time, it's great to have him here.'
