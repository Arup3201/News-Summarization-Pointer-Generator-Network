A French-built warship designed to strengthen Russia's ability to deploy helicopter gunships, troops and tanks is preparing for its first test run today.

The test of the Vladivostok helicopter carrier comes just as Western powers threaten economic sanctions in the hope of reining in Russian President Vladimir Putin's military threat to Ukraine.

The warship is part of a €1.2billion
 deal that marked the biggest-ever sale of Nato weaponry 
to Moscow - a deal that raised eyebrows in Russia and the West when it was struck in
 2011.

Bad timing: The test of the Vladivostok helicopter carrier comes just as Western powers threaten economic sanctions in the hope of reining in Russian President Vladimir Putin's military threat to Ukraine. It is preparing to sail from Sanit-Nazaire harbour in northern France today.

Prepared: The warship is part of a billion euro deal that marked the biggest-ever sale of Nato weaponry to Moscow - a deal that raised eyebrows in Russia and the West when it was struck in 2011.

A spokesman for the shipbuilder says the Vladivostok helicopter carrier is setting sail from the French Atlantic port of Saint-Nazaire later today.

A few hundred miles away in Paris, France's government is hosting American, Russian and other leading world diplomats amid mounting tensions over Ukraine.

France is one of the many countries to have criticised Russia's military incursion into Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, but says it has no plans to scrap the controversial defense deal. 

France, like many of 
Russia's European trading partners, has found itself wedged between 
efforts to squeeze Russia diplomatically and its own economic interests.

On its way: The Vladivostok is on track to be delivered to Russia by the last quarter of this year, a spokesman for the French state-backed naval shipbuilder said

Prepared: The warship is part of a billion euro deal that marked the biggest-ever sale of Nato weaponry to Moscow - a deal that raised eyebrows in Russia and the West when it was struck in 2011. It was first launched in Octover last year, when Russian naval officials (second from left and second from right) were present to inspect their new helicopter carrier.

Awkward: France is one of the many countries to have criticised Russia's military incursion into Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, but says it has no plans to scrap the controversial defense deal

Unplanned: A sister ship, the Sebastopol - named after a port in the Ukrainian region of Crimea that has been controlled by Russia since Saturday - is scheduled to be delivered late next year

The French government's priority is reviving the economy and battling unemployment, and the deal with Russia underpins some 1,000 jobs.

The Vladivostok is on track to be delivered to Russia by the last quarter of this year, said spokesman Emmanuel Gaudez of DCNS, a French state-backed naval shipbuilder manufacturing the warships along with South Korean-controlled shipbuilder STX.

A sister ship, the Sebastopol - named after a port in the Ukrainian region of Crimea that has been controlled by Russia since Saturday - is scheduled to be delivered about a year later.

'We're not going to comment on the political situation - that's for politicians to decide,' the spokesman said..

Sanctions: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (left) this morning warned Vladimir Putin (right) that the EU may seize billions of roubles belonging to him and his oligarch allies if there is no 'de-escalation' in tensions

Threat: Armed Russian soldiers march outside a Ukrainian military unit in the village of Perevalnoye in Crimea

France has joined the United States and Britain in suspending preparations for a Group of Eight summit in Russia in June, and France and EU allies are considering possible sanctions against Russia.

Earlier this morning, European Union leaders warned Russia that it may seize money held in European bank accounts if there is no 'de-escalation' in tensions with Ukraine by tomorrow.

The sanctions could lead to billions of roubles in cash and assets belonging to Putin and his oligarch allies being seized, with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius adding that the measures could also include visa restrictions and the suspension of other economic ties.

Russia responded to the threats by issuing its own sanctions warning, saying lawmakers are drafting a law to allow the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of European or U.S. companies if sanctions are imposed over Ukraine.

Weapons: The heavily armed Russian servicemen patrol the Ukrainian military base earlier this morning

Not getting through: Russian Navy ships block the entrance to the important Crimean port of Sevastopol

Speaking to France's BFM TV, Fabius: 'Let's start to initiate the path of dialogue, but at the same time tomorrow there is an EU summit and sanctions could be voted tomorrow if there is no de-escalation. I expect and hope that Russia will today tell us that there is a prospect for dialogue [with Ukraine].'

Fabius was speaking before hosting talks between his Russian, U.S., Ukrainian and other counterparts on the margins of a long-scheduled meeting on Lebanon in the French capital.

Andrei Klishas, head of the constitutional legislation committee in Russia's upper parliament house, responded to the threats by detailing plans for sanctions against EU and U.S. assets in responce.

He was quoted by Russia's RIA news service as saying: the bill 'would offer the president and government opportunities to defend our sovereignty from threats'.

He added that lawyers were examining whether the confiscation of foreign companies' assets, property and accounts would comply with the Russian constitution but said such steps would 'clearly be in line with European standards'.

The economic sabre-rattling came as new Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Russia's deployment of forces in the Crimea region is having an 'extremely negative' impact on the country's economy.
