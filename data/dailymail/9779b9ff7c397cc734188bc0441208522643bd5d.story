Green-fingered allotment owners whose patches were torched after they won a gardening competition say they were targeted by jealous arsonists.

Roy Brookman, 78, and Bill Boag, 64, won first and second prizes in this summer's Bexley in Bloom competition with their carefully-tended allotments in Sidcup, Kent.

But days later the results of their hard work were razed to the ground after a fire broke out on their plots, completely destroying them.

In ruins: Bill Boag, 64, and Roy Brookman, 78, found their prize-winning Sidcup allotments burned to the ground

Scorched earth: The friends say they can't accuse anyone but they suspect arson after last Sunday's blaze

Before the blaze: It's not hard to see why the men responsible for this meticulous allotment have won prizes

Retired bus driver Roy Brookman, 78, said: 'Both our sheds were totally burnt to the ground - it's so depressing.

'We don't know what happened. There could be jealousy going on.

'We can't accuse anyone but that's what we think, as we got first and second prize at the Bexley in Bloom competition in July.'

Mr Brookman and his friend, retired policeman Mr Boag, regularly tend to their crops at the allotments in Sidcup, Kent.

But at 9pm last Sunday, firefighters were called fire broke out at their carefully cultivated allotments.

Grandfather of six Mr Brookman said the blaze destroyed not only the displays and crops at the allotment he has cultivated for the last five years, but also his shed which housed a cooker, tools and tunnels.

Targets: Police are treating the blaze at the allotments tended by Mr Boag, left, and Mr Brookman, as suspicious

He said: 'It could cost £500 to £600 to replace but it's not just the expense, it's the work we've put in.

'Four years of hard work destroyed in a few hours - so many tools and memories of keepsakes.'

Ten firefighters managed to prevent the blaze from spreading to the rest of the allotments, and Bexley police confirmed they are treating the blaze as suspicious.
