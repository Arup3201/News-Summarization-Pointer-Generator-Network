Golf caddy Matt Kelly was caught brawling with a rival bagman at the Australian Open

Two golf caddies were caught brawling at the Australian Open yesterday after a row at a casino spilled out onto the green.

Grant Buchanan, who works for world no. 544 James Nitties and Matt Kelly, who works for world no.88 Marc Leishman had to be physically restrained after coming to blows in the practice area.

PGA Tour officials interviewed the pair who are now facing disciplinary action.

Tournament director Andrew Langford-Jones said decision on any disciplinary action would be determined within a week.

'Our
members in no way condone this behavior, and we are saddened the 
incident has drawn attention away from this great tournament,' he said.

According
to Buchanan, Kelly had been mocking him in a casino on Tuesday night 
over Nitties failure to break into the US PGA Tour.

He claimed Kelly said: 'You blokes are f***ing kidding, why are you wasting your time in America?'

Buchanan claimed when they bumped into each other on the practice green Kelly began taunting him again.

He
added: 'Matt was a good friend of mine, so I thought. He said some 
things that offended me and I approached him to clarify it and clear the
air, and he pretty much laughed in my face.â€™

The two caddies then began to brawl and tumbled to the ground before being broken up by Nitties.

Kelly sustained a cut lip in the fight and had to leave the course to wash blood from his

He has refused to comment.

Leishman, who is Australia's only winner on the US PGA tour this season, said he was sure his bagman was the victim.

He told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'I don't think me or Matty have got anything to worry about.

'I was there and he didn't do anything.

Now you're fore it: Grant Buchanan, the caddy for golfer James Nitties (left) and Matt Kelly who carries the bag of golfer Marc Leishman had to be separated after coming to blows

'He stood there, copped what he got and didn't do anything apart from that. I was proud of him, to be honest.'

Leishman had a 2-under 70 on Thursday, leaving him four 
strokes behind leader John Senden.

Nitties shot 77. He failed to earn a 2013 PGA Tour card 
Monday in California in the qualifying tournament.
