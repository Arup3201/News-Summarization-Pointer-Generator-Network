In Las Vegas the stakes are always high - but for this fearless daredevil dicing with death on a wire hundreds of feet above the ground they just got even higher.

Thrill seeker Mickey Wilson laid it all on the line as he placed his hands behind his head and dangled by his feet from the wire with the hustle and bustle of the famous party strip below.

Relying on just a thin safety rope attached to the line, even the slightest lapse in concentration could have sent him tumbling. But this didn't prevent him from performing heart-stopping tricks for onlookers almost 500ft below.

High stakes: Daredevil Mickey Wilson performs tricks on a wire hundreds of feet above the hustle and bustle of the famous Las Vegas party strip

Laying it on the line: Mr Wilson lies back and puts his hands behind his head with just his feet balancing on the wire as he dangles above the famous Sin City

Show of strength: The incredible moves were captured by keen photographer Dan Krauss, who explained how slacklining 'is all based on concentration and mental discipline'

Risky business: Mr Wilson manages to keep his balance on the line 500ft above the city of Las Vegas

The scenery is totally alien to what Mr Wilson , from Boulder in Colorado, USA, is used to - with bright lights, 
music, traffic, screams from rollercoasters and even giant aircraft 
flying overhead to distract him.

His
 incredible skill was captured by keen photographer Dan Krauss who said:
 'Slacklining is all based on concentration and mental discipline - as 
soon as you lose your focus you will lose your balance.

'In the desert you're usually alone with yourself, your friends and nature with not much to distract you except your thoughts.

'But
 with an urban line there are countless distractions making it extremely
 difficult to concentrate on your balance - fortunately Mickey is one of
 the best in the world, he's amazing.

Above the lights: Even the slightest lapse in concentration could send the daring thrill seeker tumbling, but even this doesn't prevent him performing heart-stopping tricks for onlookers almost 500ft below

Setting: The Las Vegas scenery is not what Mr Wilson, from Boulder in Colorado, is used to, with bright lights, music, traffic, and even giant aircraft flying overhead to distract him

Distractions: Photographer Mr Krauss said slacklining in urban areas means 'there are countless distractions making it extremely difficult to concentrate on your balance'

Audience: Mr Krauss said people on the ground 'seemed pretty shocked and couldn't believe what was happening' as they watched Mr Wilson walk the line

'People seemed pretty shocked and couldn't believe what was happening up there - they seemed excited as well as confused.

'From a photography perspective the biggest challenge was getting unique shots as it was pretty difficult to move around freely.

'After too many trips running back inside and out to get to each side I just started walking across the edge of the building which was a little scary without a harness and at the edge of something so high.'

Finely balanced: The talented Mr Wilson concentrates as he makes his way along the line, hundreds of feet in the air above Las Vegas

Shots: Photographer Mr Krauss said one of the biggest challenges was getting some unique shots due to the difficulty in being able to move freely while in the correct position to capture the images
