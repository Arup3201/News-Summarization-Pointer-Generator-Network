Shamed Andrew Mitchell’s official Jaguar has been scrapped by new Chief Whip Sir George Young.

The gas-guzzling car was ordered by Mr Mitchell after he discovered he would have to walk the 200 yards from Downing Street to Parliament.

But on Friday he was forced to resign, a month after a foul-mouthed rant at police officers who told him he could not ride his bike through the Downing Street gates.

At the height of the plebgate row, Andrew Mitchell emerged from a small blue car to deliver an apology. But he had a Jaguar XF on order

Now Sir George – dubbed the bicycling 
baronet for his preferred mode of transport – has pulled the plug before
 a final contract was signed.

Two weeks after his appointment Mr Mitchell had demanded a dedicated vehicle to ferry him and other whips around the corner in Westminster.

While most ministers use an eco-friendly Toyota Prius, Mr Mitchell insisted on a Jaguar XF.

But Sir George was appalled at the idea and has cancelled the order.

A Whitehall source said: ‘In a nutshell the order had been placed but the contract was never signed. The new chief whip is happy not to have a car.’

The move will save £100,000 for the taxpayer.

Mr Mitchell’s demand staggered civil servants since whips do not have public engagements.

On September 19 while trying to leave Downing Street on his bike, Mr Mitchell was told by officers to use a side gate.

In his extraordinary resignation letter Mr Mitchell denied calling police officers ‘plebs’, as they have claimed, but admitted swearing at them, telling the Prime Minister he had said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to ****ing  help us.’

This appears to contradict an appearance in the Commons earlier this week when he was seen mouthing the words ‘I didn’t swear’.

He said in his letter: ‘Over the last two days it has become clear to me that whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter I will not be able to fulfil my duties as we would both wish.’

David Cameron said he was ‘sorry’ to lose Mr Mitchell but understood why he was leaving.

Yesterday the Prime Minister was ridiculed by Labour, because he had replaced Rugby-educated Mr Mitchell with Sir George, who went to Eton.
