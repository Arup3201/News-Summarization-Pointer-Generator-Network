Council chiefs have been blamed for leaving their town a 'laughing stock' after Christmas lights were finally put up today - a month late.

While most people were preparing to take down their Christmas decorations today on the Twelfth Night, Walsall Council were erecting illuminations in Brownhills town centre in the West Midlands.

The late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs and talks had held with local people to help solve the argument over replacing the £600 set of lights.

The late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs. But rather than waiting until next year to put up the lights, the council decided to put them up today and rebranded them as 'Winter Lights' 

But the decision came too late for contractors to carry out the work in time for the Christmas period.

And rather than waiting until next year, the authority has decided to erect the tree decorations this week - and rebranded the display as 'Winter Lights' instead.

Today furious residents and local councillors slammed the council and described the move as a 'joke'.

Chairman of Brownhills Local Committee Doug Birch said: 'We are very angry about this. The town has been treated very badly.

'Our councillors pushed very hard to get us some better lights but to no avail.

'Eventually, two days before Christmas Eve, officers came to us and said they had got the funding for some new lights but it was too late for the contractors to get them up.

'They said it will be done this month and the display will be called winter lights instead.

'We don’t think it is good enough at all.'

Shop owner George Tomkins, 44, added: 'Everyone feels really let down by the council.

'We must be the only town in the country who is putting their Christmas decorations up in the New Year - we are a laughing stock.

While another resident Emily Pritchard, 67, added: 'The lights the council usually put up are very tacky and minimalistic.

'I was delighted when I heard they had paid for new ones but when we heard it wouldn’t be going up until after Christmas it became a farce.

'It is the Twelfth Night and everyone is taking their decorations down and here we are putting up ours. It is a joke.

However, Walsall Council has defended the decision to install the lights after the festive period, saying the new display will look 'amazing'.

Councillor Mohammad Nazir, cabinet member for regeneration, said: 'The original lights, which were deemed unsafe and no longer fit for purpose, were removed in preparation for the new scheme.

'The new lights, which are being installed for future use, will look amazing as hundreds of LED bulbs will bring sparkle and light to the Miner’s Island.'

According to the tradition, Christmas decorations should come down on the Twelfth Night which officially falls on January 5.

Other people maintain the actual date falls on the Epiphany on January 6 and churches often keep manger decorations up as part of their services.

The Epiphany marks the visit of the three Kings to the baby Jesus and  in which he was revealed as the son of God.
