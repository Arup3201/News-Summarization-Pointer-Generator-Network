Retailer J.C. Penney may want to rethink the design of their new kettle after a string of customers complained it looks remarkably like Hitler.

The retailer advertised the new kettle - which is exclusively available in its stores - on a huge billboard over the 405 Interstate Highway in southern California.

But rather than being tempted into buying new kitchen equipment, commuters driving along the route near Culver City found themselves instantly reminded of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

Several motorists took pictures of the sign, which is around 10 foot tall and 36 foot wide, and posted it on Twitter along with their views about the kettle's resemblance to the  World War II dictator.

Jim @scplanetable tweeted: Every time I see that JC Penny billboard with the teapot, I keep seeing Hitler. Seriously, the thing looks exactly like Hitler. 405 S, man.'

Proving the billboard may not be the best advertising for the retailer, another commuter, Benari @benarilee tweeted: 'Uh, no thanks, JC Penny. I don't think I want your HITLER teapot.'

Other social media users added that they dreaded to think what the store's pressure cookers must look like.

Some took to Twitter to complain of the similarity between the stainless steel tea kettle and the Nazi dictator
