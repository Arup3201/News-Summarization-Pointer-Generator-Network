The decorative teapot, made from Paris porcelein, is to be put on sale for the first time in 213 years

It would have been enough to make Admiral Lord Nelson choke on his tea.

A decorative teapot Nelson used at the height of the Napoleonic Wars unaware it was actually French porcelain has emerged for sale for the first time in 213 years.

The 6ins high piece was part of a service known as the 'Baltic tea set' presented to the great naval hero to mark his victory at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1802.

The blank chinaware set was decorated with oak leaves, acorns and an anchor in a London workshop in a rush so it could be used at a banquet held in Nelson's honour.

The service was gifted to Nelson afterwards and ended up at Merton Place in Surrey, the palatial home Nelson shared with his mistress, Lady Emma Hamilton. 

Following his death in 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, where Nelson led the Royal Navy to victory against the combined French and Spanish fleet, the set was listed on an inventory of Emma's possessions at Merton.

It was later passed onto Nelson's brother, William, and his wife, Hilare Barlow, Dowager Countess Nelson, Duchess of Bronte, and then by descent to the present owner, who is remaining anonymous.

It was only after the teapot was put up for auction with an estimate of £20,000 that experts were able to examine it and found the porcelain was actually made in Paris.

It was imported to Britain and is likely to have been surplus stock available to the chinaware decorators in London at the time.

Admiral Horatio Nelson would not have known the teapot, which was part of the 'Baltic tea set', was French

Experts say Nelson would not have been aware it was French.

Fergus Gambon, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Nelson wouldn't have had a clue as to what porcelain the set was made from.

'In the early 19th century, when this teapot made, a lot of white porcelain from Paris was imported to the UK where it would have been decorated.

'The workshops of London probably didn't have an idea if they were painting French or English porcelain.

'The shapes of French porcelain items compared to English porcelain are often different. This teapot is distinctly French. You can tell by its tall, cylinder shape and sloping shoulders.'

The teapot first surfaced on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow last year after its owner took it along.

John Sandon, the expert who inspected the teapot on the Roadshow, said: 'The ladies of London clubbed together to give to Nelson chinaware when he attended a banquet with the Lord Mayor.

'It is slightly confusing when you look at the teapot because it isn't a British teapot at all, it is French.

'Nelson was out there fighting the enemy yet here is a teapot of French porcelain.

'Nelson shared his home with Emma and while he was away at sea one can imagine her being there and entertaining with the very fine china that Nelson had been given.

'When he died there was an inventory made of all the contents at Merton and there were two services listed.

'One was the Baltic service. It is exciting to think of Emma pouring tea for Nelson out of this teapot.'

The 'Baltic Set' was a tea service and a dessert set both of Paris porcelain, together with a dinner set believed to be creamware.

The teapot carries the inscription 'Nelson 2nd April Baltic', the handle and spout flanked by further gilding of '15th Febry', 'San Joseph', and 'Glorious 1st August'.

Nelson's niece, Charlotte Nelson, accompanied her uncle at the banquet in London.

She said at the time: 'I wish you could have seen all the people jumping up to the carriage to see my uncle and thousands of people round him looking up at him.

'All the ladies had their handkerchiefs out of the windows when my uncle passed, they and the people calling out "Nelson for Ever."'

Following William Nelson's death in 1835, Hilare married for the third time to George Knight, the nephew of Jane Austen.

When she died in 1857, this teapot passed to her niece, Florence Catherine Elizabeth Barlow, and then to her daughter, Colin Joyce who bequeathed it to her cousin, Hilare Margaret Barlow, who is mother of the present owner.

The teapot is being sold by Bonhams on April 1.
