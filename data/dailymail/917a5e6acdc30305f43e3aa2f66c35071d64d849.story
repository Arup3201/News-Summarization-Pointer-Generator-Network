One of the last remaining survivors of the largest Jewish revolt of the Second World War has died at the age of 93.

Boruch Spiegel, who is believed to have given the signal to launch the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, was described by his son Julius as a 'reluctant hero', following his death in Montreal.

Mr Spiegel was among 750 Jews who managed to hold off heavily armed German soldiers for more than a month as they tried to storm the Polish ghetto, intent on transporting its occupants to Nazi death camps.

With Mr Spiegel's death on May 9, the tiny group of 
survivors of the legendary World War II revolt that was crushed 70 years
 ago this month grows even smaller.

The then 23-year-old was one of about 750 Jewish fighters who on April 19, 1943, launched an uprising that took the Germans off guard.

The fighters were overwhelmingly outnumbered and outgunned and the revolt never had a real chance of victory, but the determined insurgents still managed to hold out for a month - longer than some countries invaded by Hitler.

'He was very modest, a reluctant hero,' his son Julius Spiegel said of his father. 'He was given an opportunity and he took it. I don’t think he was braver or more resourceful than anyone else.'

By the end of May German forces had crushed the uprising, by which time Mr Spiegel had escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with a few dozen other fighters - among them his future wife, Chaika Belchatowska.

They trawled through underground sewage canals to reach the so-called 'Aryan side' of the Polish capital.

Those left behind were sent to death camps such as Treblinka, where most died.

Their struggle endures as a symbol of resistance against the odds and a desire to maintain human dignity in the worst of possible conditions.

Ultimately, though, the German revenge was brutal; the Warsaw Ghetto was systematically burned down building by building, culminating in the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw.

After surviving the ghetto uprising, Mr Spiegel and his future wife joined the Polish partisans and also took part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, a larger city-wide revolt against the occupying Germans.

'He was essentially an ordinary guy forced by circumstances to do things that were out of character,' Julius Spiegel said.

Born in October 1919, Mr Spiegel grew up in Warsaw, the son of an Orthodox woman and a leather worker father, according to a New York Times report.

After the Germans invaded in 1939, Mr Spiegel and his brother Beryl became involved in the Bundist underground.

The Spiegel family managed to hold out for a period as Jewish families were deported around them, thanks to a steel door on their apartment, but his father died of malnutrition and his mother, two sisters, and brother Beryl died in a manner he never learned.

Mr Spiegel himself was once taken to the staging area for the Treblinka camp, but managed to escape and return to the ghetto, the report said.

Even after the Germans crushed the 1943 uprising, Mr Spiegel fought with Partisans before returning to Warsaw to fight with Poles in a further revolt from August to September 1944. Warsaw was liberated in January 1945.

The Spiegels moved to Canada in 1948, where Mr Spiegel followed in the footsteps of his father by working in the leather industry, eventually establishing his own factory.

It's not clear how many of the Warsaw Ghetto fighters are still living, but the number is certainly small.

When
 Poland held national ceremonies last month marking the 70th anniversary
 of the start of the ghetto uprising, officials in Warsaw said they 
believed there could be four survivors left.

Only
 one, Simha Rotem, was visibly present at the ceremony, giving a speech 
and accepting a high state honor from the Polish president.

However, Havi Dreifuss, a historian and Holocaust expert with Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem, the Jerusalem-based Holocaust research institution and museum, warned against trying to put a number on how many fighters remain, in part because it's sometimes hard to distinguish fighters from other resisters.

She noted that aside from those with weapons, there were others who were entrenched in hiding places and refused to obey Nazi orders to show up for transportations to labor or concentration camps, and that an appreciation has grown over time for their resistance during the uprising.

Borech Spiegel is survived by his son, Julius, a retired parks commissioner for Brooklyn, daughter Mindy Spiegel of Montreal, and four grandchildren. His wife died in 2002.

During the Second World War as many as 400,000 Polish Jews were crammed into the confines of the Warsaw Ghetto.

Within its walls they lived under the shadow of rampant disease and starvation, even before German troops began transporting Jews en masse to the Treblinka extermination camp.

The seeds were sown for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in January 1943, when German soldiers arriving to implement a second deportation of Jews to the camp were met by Jewish resistance fighters who engaged them in clashes.

The deportation was halted after a period of days and only saw 5,000 - rather than the intended 7,000 - Jews taken away. The occupants of the ghetto were ready to fight what was regarded as a battle of honour for the Jewish people, led by two resistance organisations; the ZZW and the ZOB.

On 19 April 1943 the police and SS auxiliary forces entered the ghetto for a further deportation action intended to last three days.

They were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways, sewers, and windows. The Germans suffered casualties and their advance was halted.

German forces resorted to systematically burning down the ghetto, building by building, prompting thousands of surviving Jews and fighters to take cover in underground bunkers or the sewer system. Many were forced out of their hiding places by troops who dropped in smoke bombs.

On May 8, the Germans discovered a large dugout located at Miła 18 Street, which served as ŻOB's main command post. Most of the organisation's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed a mass suicide by ingesting cyanide.

The suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 May 1943, with the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw.
