U.S. envoy Samantha Power demonstrated the new, safe way to greet people in Ebola-ravaged countries this week.

It's known as the 'Ebola handshake', which involves touching the person you're greeting with your elbow.

Ms Power, the U.S ambassador to the UN, touched elbows on Tuesday with Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf during a news conference in the city of Monrovia.

Ebola is not contagious until symptoms begin, and it takes close contact with bodily fluids to spread

Ebola is spread through direct contact (through broken skin or through your eyes, nose, or mouth) with Blood and body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects (like needles) that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola.

Ms Power said
she will return from West Africa to the United States and the
United Nations on Thursday with a message of 'hope and
possibility' that the global response to the Ebola outbreak is
working, but more resources are needed.

But she warned: 'This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines. A few are doing a lot. But a lot are doing very little, or nothing at all.'

Speaking to Reuters after visiting the three worst-affected
countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, Power said among
several areas to focus on was removing the stigma of the deadly
hemorrhagic disease in those countries and around the world.

Ebola survivors in West Africa have been shunned, while
Australia has banned visas for citizens of the three countries
and several U.S. states have imposed a mandatory quarantine on
health care workers returning from the region.

'It is quite literally the most heartbreaking form of
ailment that any community could ever go through where you
cannot care for your loved ones,' Power said. 'The only thing
worse than losing a child is not being able to hold the child
that you're losing. It's mind-blowing.'

She said recently established command and control centers in
the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone - bringing together the
governments, the United Nations, foreign countries taking a lead
in the response and aid groups - were proving successful.

The coordination was 'a sight to behold,' said Power.

In Freetown in Sierra Leone, the rate of safe burials of the
highly contagious bodies of Ebola victims had risen from 30
percent to 98 percent in the few days a burial command center
had been in operation, while in Liberia a mobile laboratory in a
remote area had cut testing times from five days to five hours.

'It's a great privilege to be able to bring back that sense
of hope and possibility to the United States and to the U.N. Now
the message is, 'What we are doing is working,'' she said.

'What we have is not enough, but we know from our
interventions that they can have these pronounced speedy
effects. So now we can say you have opportunity to be a part of
a winning enterprise,' Power said of her bid to convince more
countries to join the response efforts. 

Power said it was important that command and control centers
were now in place in regional areas in all three countries.

She said lessons could be learned and shared from the
responses in each country. In Guinea, the national response
center in Conakry was a couple of conference rooms with few 
resources and U.N. officials were based elsewhere in the city.

As hundreds of millions of dollars is spent on tackling the
outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday that
Liberia may be seeing a decline in the spread of the virus,
though the battle is far from won.

'Given the unpredictability of the epidemic, the risk of
having excess capacity on the ground and available is a risk
well worth taking,' Andy Weber, deputy head of the U.S. State
Department's Ebola Coordination Unit, told Reuters.

'We can't stop the work to get as many of the required ETUs
(Ebola Treatment Units) in place, to have them geographically
dispersed so they're accessible to as many potential patients as
possible,' said Weber, who traveled to West Africa with Power.

Power will speak at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels on
Thursday. She says more countries need to step up to help fight
the disease that has killed 5,000 people mainly in Liberia,
Sierra Leone and Guinea since March, with a handful of cases in
Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the United States.

The epidemic remains at a scale and severity the world has
never seen before, said Power, who spoke with Reuters as she
traveled to Brussels from West Africa.

'It will be something people talk about generations from
now. There are these historical challenges that arise. Sometimes
it's the violence that one country commits against another, or
atrocities against civilians. It could be a tsunami. Here it is
the worst public health emergency in history,' she said.

'People will ask, 'Where were you when Ebola tried to wipe
out communities in West Africa?''
