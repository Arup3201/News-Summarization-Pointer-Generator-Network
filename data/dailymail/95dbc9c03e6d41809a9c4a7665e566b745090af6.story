Pull a British-owned suitcase off an airport conveyor belt and chances are you will be able to tell where in the country its owners are from, just by opening it up and taking a peek inside

And you needn't even look too closely at the contents of the bag to make your guess... just at how they have been packed.

Whether you're a roller, a wrapper, a shrinker, a flinger or a stacker may provide clues as to where in the UK you reside, according to new research into the holiday packing habits of the population.

Are you a flinger, a roller, a wrapper or a stacker? Where in Britain you live might determine it

Holiday-makers from Scotland, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland are most often space-saving 'rollers', turning each item of clothing into a neat little sausage to maximise space and prevent crumpling.

The West Midlands, North East and South West is home to the super-neat and ultra-careful 'wrappers', fond of neatly encasing each piece of clothing in tissue paper to minimise ironing later.

Architecturally-savvy 'stackers' are most often found in East Anglia and the North West, and they can be spotted building piles of clothes, beginning with the largest pieces and working their way up to the smaller items in an orderly manner.

One third of Britons will be stowing away food and beverage 
favourites such as teabags, brown sauce, pork pies, digestive biscuits 
and marmalade into their suitcase to enjoy while on holiday.

'Shrinker' fashionistas - most frequently found in London and Wales - are the most forward-thinking of the lot, choosing outfits for every day of the holiday, then vacuum-packing each one to utilise on space and aid un-packing later.

And then there are the 'flingers', those who don't have the time, energy or inclination to bother with any of the above, and instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close. And these busy souls are living in Yorkshire and the South East.

Flingers, those who don't have the time, energy or inclination to bother rolling or stacking, instead just hurl anything they can find into the open suitcase and pray it will close

The research, conducted by Travelodge, also found that 52 per cent of the Britons who will be going on summer holiday this year (75 per cent) will dedicate an enormous seven hours
packing their holiday essentials, which includes shopping for bits and pieces needed for the trip.

Wrappers

Neatly wrap each piece of clothing in tissue paper to prevent creasing

Stackers

Build a stack of clothes starting with the biggest items at the bottom and working up to the smaller items

(East Anglia, North West)

Shrinkers

Make complete outfits and  vacuum pack to utilise space and aid un-packing   

(London, Wales)

Flingers

Throw everything into a bag with no order or folding involved

(South East, Yorkshire)

Despite this, British holidaymakers will collectively splash out 
£684 million during their holiday on essential items they have accidentally left at home, an average spend of £26.50.

Some 51 per cent of us forget something important at home, and the items most frequently needed to be bought at the airport or holiday destination are men's swimming trunks, followed by jumpers and cardigans, then bikinis, dresses, sunglasses, shorts, underwear, coats and finally shoes.

In all, the UK will splash out a staggering £684 
million (an average spend of £26.50) on forgotten items every year.

Travelodge surveyed 2,000 adults aged 25 to 34, and found that 82 per cent of holidaymakers find 
packing for their summer break very stressful.

A fifth (20 per cent) of Britons 
totally rely upon their partner to pack for them, and one in ten farm the task out to their mothers.

The research also revealed a fifth
(21 per cent) of lazy Britons just throw a selection of items into their 
suitcase and play pot luck with their belongings on holiday, while 61 per cent pack with military precision and dedicate time to prepare a detailed schedule and essentials check-list 
prior to starting the task.

Ironically, whilst British 
holidaymakers' bulging suitcases may be lacking one holiday essential, more
than two thirds of us (67 per cent) of Britons usually bring back home 
up to six unworn complete outfits and three pairs of shoes that were not
suitable for their holiday. 

How do you pack yours?

To help Britons pack better for their 
holiday, Travelodge developed a seven step guide to ensure no 
essential holiday items are left behind for this year’s summer break.

Step One: Think
What & Where

Consider everything you might be doing during your 
holiday (Posh dinners, sporting activities, sight seeing) then put your 
favourite items for these scenarios on your bed in piles of tops, 
bottoms, dresses, shoes, jackets/cover-ups, swimwear. Anything that 
doesn't have a specific use doesn't need to come with you.

Step Two: Colour Code Clothes:

Look at everything and choose items based on the fact they will work 
with lots of other items. Thinking of a colour palette makes this even 
simpler. What you are doing here is ensuring everything works really 
hard and you don’t end up lugging loads of things that just don’t go 
with anything else and you will end up never wearing.

Step Three: Divide
& Rule

Once you have decided on your clotting, lay it out on the
bed before you place them in the suitcase and cut in half. It may sound
drastic but it forces you to focus and just remember all the items you 
have taken on holiday before and never worn.

Step Four: Rollin’,
Rollin’, Rollin’

Roll every item that can be rolled, as this will 
negate creasing. If you take anything remotely tailored, turn it inside 
out and tuck in the sleeves and it will arrive in the best shape 
possible.

Sitting on your suitcase to cram everything in is a common last resort

Step Five: Bury
the shoes 

Pack shoes at the bottom of your suitcase and surround 
them with your underwear. Remember to pack into the corners of your bag -
lots of space can be wasted by not filling a bag correctly.

Step Six: Go
See Through   

See through wash bags with compartments are brilliant 
for organising your toiletries. They tend to be lightweight and you can 
check quickly to see if you've forgotten anything

Step Seven: Weather
planning  

Look at an updated weather forecast just before packing to 
ensure you are taking the right clothes for the weather conditions at 
your destination.
