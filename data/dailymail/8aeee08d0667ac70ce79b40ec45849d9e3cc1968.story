For many women, trying to balance childcare responsibilities with a busy career can be a struggle.

Middle-class mothers are quitting high powered jobs because they are not prepared to behave like men by getting into work early and staying out late socialising, a new study claims.

Women are more likely to ditch a highly paid job that clashes with childcare responsibilities, rather than compete with men in their office, British researchers said.

Trying to have it all: Women are more likely to ditch a highly paid job that clashes with childcare responsibilities, rather than compete with men in their office, researchers said

Despite some gains in equality, workplace culture is still male dominated, said workplace psychologists from the University of Leicester's School of Management.

This means that workplaces could be losing well qualified and capable female executives rather than adapt the culture to suit working mothers.

‘Middle-class working mothers are leaving work because they are unwilling to behave like men,’ said report authors Emma Cahusac and Shireen Kanji.

‘Mothers in professional and managerial jobs are expected to stay late or get in early even if they have negotiated reduced working hours.

‘And (they are expected) to socialise with colleagues or clients in the evenings - even though this clashes with their childcare responsibilities.

‘They must do so because working culture is still organised by men, who are less involved in childcare. Many mothers respond by leaving their jobs.

‘Unless mothers mimic successful men, they do not look the part for success in organisations.’

Their study, which is based on interviews with professional women in different sectors, found that it is not just men who are guilty of creating a hostile environment for working mothers.

Female employees without children are quite happy to promote and join in with the macho culture, they found.

One mother, who used to work as a banker, said when she left as 6pm to look after her children she would get 'barbed comments' from a female co-worker who did not have children.

Some women hide the fact they are mothers to avoid falling foul of hostile attitudes, according to the report that was published in the journal Gender, Work and Organisation.

The researchers interviewed 26 women who had left work after having children or getting pregnant in reach their conclusions.

Many of the women said they were 'side-lined' on their return to the office after giving birth.

'Many women leave high-powered jobs because they are relegated to lesser roles and feel the need to suppress their identities as mothers,' the study said.

‘This is not only unfair. As an economy, we cannot afford to waste such skilled and educated workers.’

Boys whose fathers work very long hours are more likely to become tearaways, according to research published last summer.

A study of more than 1,400 children found those whose fathers worked more than 55 hours a week were more delinquent and aggressive than their peers, yet the same phenomenon was not identified in daughters.

Further research now needs to be carried out to discover why this happens in males, and to look for ways to tackle it.

The study was run by the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, but was based in Western Australia where one in five fathers work at least 55 hours week when their children were between five and eight.

Mothers' working hours did not seem to matter, although few Australian mothers worked long hours, according to the study.

Dr Jianghong Li, of The Social Science Research Centre, Berlin, said: 'It is possible when fathers work very long hours, children are less well monitored after school, especially if mothers also work full time hours.

'There is some evidence pre-adolescent boys are less well monitored than girls when fathers have high work related demands, including long hours, and as a consequence have more conduct problems.'

The culture of working long hours, which has crept into many jobs should be the next policy frontier, said the researchers.
