The Class of '92 have made their first major managerial decision after sacking Phil Power as Salford City's manager and raiding Ramsbottom United for Anthony Johnson.

Salford had won only seven of their last 20 games and the owners - Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt decided in conjunction with joint stakeholder Peter Lim and the club's board - that a change needed to be made.

Power's exit was confirmed on Friday and Phil Neville and Paul Scholes stepped in to oversee the 2-1 victory over Kendal Town on Saturday afternoon. Gary Neville is understood to be in Dubai this weekend.

Sportsmail revealed on Saturday that the Neville and Scholes tag-team would be a one-off with Ramsbottom's Johnson poised to take the job.

A club statement read: 'Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley have agreed to take over at Moor Lane following the departure of Phil Power yesterday Salford City Football Club are delighted to announce the appointment of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley as joint managers with Glen Moses acting as their assistant.

'All three have joined from Ramsbottom United where they have spent six very successful seasons.'

Salford are third in the Evostik League Northern Premier.
