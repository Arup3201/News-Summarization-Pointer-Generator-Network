When you first see Alien Disclosure UK's 'evidence' of life on the Red Planet, all you can see is a mass of rocks.

But as the camera zooms in and then pulls back, you cannot help but make out the form of a little green man scuttling forward to pick up what appears to be an iconic Dr Martens boot lying on the dusty floor.

The video is the latest in a long line of curious and quirky images from the Red Planet that internet users have jumped to interpret.

That's where we left it! A 'boot' is visible, sitting on the surface of Mars, and just behind it, a little hominid appears to be tracking forward

On the right foot: The alien looks too small to get any use out of the boot - just one of the many mysteries of Mars

However, it is unlikely to be the smoking gun (or boot) that NASA has been looking for to announce the existence of extra-terrestrial existence.

In the early days, the planet was throwing up curiosities. In the 1800s, earthbound observers were certain they could see canals - and even cities - through their telescopes.

But as we became better with our optics, so did our understanding of Mars, and this belief was put to bed as newer images showed no trace of life.

Then, in 1976, Mars was back with a new mystery - the famous Face on Mars, taken by the Viking 1 during a flyby in 1976.

This was later shown to be just another light and perspective trick by Mars, but the haunting visage captured the world's attention.

More recently, YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, part of Alien Disclosure UK, has been gazing at the latest images from the Curiosity Rover, and has collected a fine collection of oddities.

These include white 'flying objects' zooming across the Martian sky - and then a 
collection of mysterious 'items' he spotted in a video from Gale Crater.

The
 image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint 
outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail.

Another
 rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal, and a crevice on 
another geological formation looks like a smiling Martian critter.

He announced: 'Mars Curiosity captures a 
possible ancient finger, a dome shaped object, a shoe or sandal and a 
possible Martian creature.

'Are
 these anomalies real, tricks of the light or something else, as always 
you decide.'

Ancient digit: From the Face on Mars, captured by NASA in 1976, to the 'finger' found just last week, Mars likes to tease us with suggestions of life

Martian footwear: Another rock that caught the attention of the UFO enthusiast made him think of a long-forgotten shoe or sandal on the surface of the Red Planet

Martian life form: An image of a rock with a crevice in the middle vaguely resembles a grinning extra-terrestrial critter

Incredible: Nasa's Curiosity shows the base of Mount Sharp, the rover's eventual science destination, in its latest image release

UFO or camera snafu: The same relentless web user posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a Curiosity image, revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers

Theory debunked: Experts came out saying that the four 'saucers' are actually just dead pixels in the rover's camera

The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence. A fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image

Two lights are seen on Mars. First (top), a light moves across the Martian horizon, and second (bottom) a small light rises from the surface of the planet
