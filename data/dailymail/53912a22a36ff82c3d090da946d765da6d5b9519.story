A herd of cows was spotted marauding through a sleepy village and into residents' front gardens after mysteriously escaping from a field in a quiet Suffolk village.

Police had to help round up the Longhorn steers, cattle and calves after they sauntered through the streets of Reydon, near the seaside resort of Southwold, Suffolk, early on Sunday morning.

Community nurse Cathy Ryan, 57, jumped out of bed after hearing the cows 'bellowing' outside her home and managed to coax them back into a field.

Cows were seen strolling through the streets of the tiny village Reydon, near Southwold, Suffolk, early on Sunday morning

She said: 'I am used to waking up to the dawn chorus. But I thought I was dreaming when I heard cows bellowing outside my bedroom window at 5am on a Sunday morning.

'The whole herd of cattle, including the Longhorn steers, were running down, heading towards Southwold.

'They briefly stopped to munch the grass and then turned back and ran.'

She added: 'I managed to get them back to the footpath leading to their field but needed more hands as there were too many escape routes.

Police rounded up the cows into a nearby field and said they were still trying to locate the owner of the escaped cattle

'Eventually police back-up arrived and we safely herded them into a field. It's a total mystery how they escaped and thankfully no one was hurt.'

A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'We had a report that a herd of cows, some with horns, had escaped from a field and were in people's gardens.

'At 6am they were back in a field, although it was not clear whether it was the right one. We are still trying to locate the owner of the cows.'
