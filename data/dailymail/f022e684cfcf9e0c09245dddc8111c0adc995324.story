Crystal Palace and Manchester United are thrashing out a deal to make Wilfried Zaha's loan deal a permanent one.

Zaha is keen on a full-time return to his old team and the two clubs are at the negotiating table now.

Palace are keen to pay around £6million,inclusive of add-ons, but United are understood to want closer to £10m for a player that cost them £15m just two years ago.

That would mean the south London club would write off the remaining £4m owed to them by United after Zaha's move to Old Trafford. 

Zaha's loan is set to run until the end of the season but if the two clubs can come to an agreement over the transfer fee it could go through on Monday with a new five-and-a-half-year contract.

The 22-year-old recently claimed he felt back at home playing back at Selhurst Park where he became a fans' favourite before leaving for Manchester United.

Zaha failed to make an impact following his £15m move to Manchester United in January 2013

Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed under former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013.

But he was loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at Old Trafford until the following summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes.

During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff.

However, Zaha is rejuvenated back at Palace and manager Alan Pardew hopes he can keep the talented winger, especially as he doesn't fall into Louis van Gaal's United plans.
