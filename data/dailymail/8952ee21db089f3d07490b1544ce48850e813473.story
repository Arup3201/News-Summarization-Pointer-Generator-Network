A former Indiana State Trooper who was acquitted last month of the murders of his wife and two children has spoken out publicly for the first time since the September 2000 slaying that shocked his small community.

David Camm thanked his supporters with a letter he posted on the Facebook group dedicated to clearing him of the murder charges.

'My heart is overflowing with love for each and every one of you. The sacrifices, dedication and emotional investment that you willing express in both words and action for little ole insignificant me is hard to wrap my head around,' he wrote.

Tragedy: Kimberly Camm, 35 (right), her son, Bradley, age 7 (left), and daughter Jill (center), age 5, were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in September 2000

Camm's first public words in more than 13 years come as it is revealed cash-strapped Floyd County, Indiana, spent an estimated $4.5million on three trials for Camm - a legal process that ultimately saw him walk free.

On October 24, jurors cleared Camm over the deaths of 35-year-old Kimberly and their children, Brad, 7, and Jill, 5, who were found shot dead at their home on September 2000.

He was convicted of their murder in 2002 and again in 2006 - though both convictions were overturned on appeal. The third trial, which took place this year and drew jurors from a town 100 miles away from Camm's home in New Albany, resulted in acquittal.

Camm said he felt betrayed by his friends at the State Police and the prosecutors office who pursed charges against him.

'On one hand I had the State of Indiana represented by people I thought were my friends, people who I thought cared for me trying to take my life from away as well as trying to deny justice for Kim, Brad and Jill,' he wrote.Â 

'On the other hand there are all of you. Over the last thirteen years I have seen the worst in people and thanks to all of you I have seen the best.'

Camm left the state police several months before the slayings, which were investigated by his former colleagues. Camm has said he was playing basketball at a church at the time of the slayings. Camm wrote that he was not ready to discuss the loss of his family.

'I am choosing to move forward. I don't want to be consumed by the past. They, the State, are not going to take more from me than they have already have gotten. My focus is the future,' Camm wrote.

He thanked God for the turn in his fortunes. 'I am a blessed man,' he wrote.

The letter was posted in the 'Free David Camm' Facebook group by his uncle, Sam Lockhart. It was signed, 'The Camm Family: David, Kim, Brad and Jill.'

Nick Stein, an attorney for Kim Camm's parents, Frank and Janice Renn, had no immediate comment on the letter. The Renns are suing David Camm to try to prevent him from recovering an estimated $625,000 in life insurance and 401(k) funds.

NBC News reports that local officials estimate the three trials for Camm - including appeals - cost about $4.5million.

That's a sizable bill for Floyd County, which is currently facing a $2.9million budget gap and considering laying off employees.

'I don't know how we're going to do it without raising taxes or laying off employees,' County Councilwoman Dana Fendley told the Louisville Courier-Journal.
