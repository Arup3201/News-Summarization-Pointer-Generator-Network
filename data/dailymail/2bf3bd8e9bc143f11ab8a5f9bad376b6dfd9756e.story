Fox News has made an on-air apology after a terrorism pundit described Birmingham as a 'no-go' area for non-Muslims.

Steven Emerson, billed as an expert on terrorism-related issues, was described by Prime Minister David Cameron as 'a complete idiot' and widely mocked by Twitter users after informing viewers the city was 'totally Muslim' and was not visited by people of other faiths.

Mr Emerson issued a string of apologies to British media outlets over his 'terrible, inexcusable error' during a broadcast last weekend and has also donated $750 to the city's children's hospital.

Fox News presenter Julie Banderas told viewers: 'Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air, regarding the Muslim population in Europe, particularly with regard to England and France.

'This applies especially to discussions of so-called no-go zones, areas where non-Muslims allegedly aren't allowed in, and police supposedly won't go.

'To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country, and no credible information to support the assertion there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion.

'There are, certainly, areas of high crime in Europe, as there are in the United States and other countries, where police and visitors enter with caution.

'We deeply regret the errors and apologise to any and all who may have taken offence, including the people of France and England.'
