He has already made abolishing the Affordable Care Act the centerpiece of his young presidential campaign, and once spoke for 21 hours straight on the floor of the U.S. Senate in a bid to block its funding.

But now Ted Cruz says he and his family will be the latest to use the system, signing up for medical insurance coverage through the Obamacare law's government-run marketplaces.

Cruz's wife Heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at Goldman Sachs to campaign with him – and lost her employer-funded plan in the process.

As Democrats gleefully mocked the irony, though, Cruz insists he's just following the law.

'We will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we're in the process of transitioning over to do that,' Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, told The Des Moines Register on Tuesday. 

The exchanges, created by the Obamacare law, are designed to be state-specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage. Using them is mandatory for middle-income Americans who want to receive federal government subsidies to help pay their premiums. 

The Affordable Care Act originally left members of Congress alone, but Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley famously inserted a 'poison pill' amendment requiring them – and their staff members – to participate like other Americans if they lacked insurance from other sources.

'The more that Congress experiences the laws it passes, the better,' Grassley said back then.

Democrats didn't budge, and the provision now requires Cruz to join millions who have signed up for Obamacare-brokered coverage.

He could get the last laught, however, using his experience to construct a first-hand testimonial about the law's shortcomings. 

Liberal lawmakers were mum Tuesday on the development, passing up an easy opportunity to call Cruz a hypocrite. 

Daily Mail Online asked five Senate offices and five House offices, all Democratic, for comment. None would offer one.

Planned Parenthood, America's biggest abortion lobby, did use the 'H' word. It has defended the Obamacare law, largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage.

'Luckily for Sen. Ted Cruz, hypocrisy isn't a pre-existing condition,' the group tweeted. 

The Democratic National Committee weighed in, but offered only a half-swing at the softball question.

'The Affordable Care Act, by design, helps Americans who have gaps in employment get coverage, and it's working,' DNC National Press Secretary Holly Shulman told Daily Mail Online.

'We encourage others to follow presidential candidate Ted Cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered.'

The Houston firebrand won't exactly get a grassroots experience when he enrolls, however.

GLEE: The Democratic National Committee piled on, but never called Cruz a hypocrite

THe 'H' WORD: Abortion lobby Planned Parenthood heaped on the scorn at Cruz's predicament

The Washington, D.C. city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that's not part of the Affordable Care Act itself, allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city's Small Business Health Options Program.

That system was designed for 'small businesses' with fewer than 50 employees. The United States Congress employs more than 20,000 people.

It also makes medical insurance customers eligible for payments from their employers for most of the premiums. 

The Obama administration's Office of Personnel Management made the arrangement legal by quietly issuing a rule just before the Obamacare law took effect – and setting the typical reimbursement level at 75 per cent.

Some customers, including well-paid senators, will get that benefit even though their income levels would be too high to qualify for subsidies if they had to buy coverage on the open exchanges like millions of others.

Cruz told CNN on Tuesday that he has no choice but to 'follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with.'

'It's one of the real differences – if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change,' Cruz said.

NOT TOO LATE, TED: Even though the Obamacare open-enrollment period is over, Americans can still sign up if they 'have certain life changes in 2015'

He also took a verbal swing at Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has allowed professional staffers on Senate committees to exempt themselves. 

'Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn't want to be under the same rules as the American people,' he sniped.

But Cruz still believes the Obamacare law should be killed – 'ripped out, root and branch' is how he put it during an Iowa event in January.

'And I believe it will be,' he told the paper, the largest and most influential in the early presidential caucus state of Iowa.

'I believe in 2017 a new president, a Republican president will sign legislation repealing every word of it,' he insisted. 

'There are a fair number of Republicans in Washington and elsewhere who have quietly and privatively given up on that fight and I have not.'
