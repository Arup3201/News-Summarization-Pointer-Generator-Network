Even he admitted it was a dumb idea.

But how Shaun Harrington escaped with his life after tackling a tiger shark with a $50 bird cage remains a mystery. 

In a heartstopping video, the 27-year-old is seen bobbing in the water clad just in bright green board shorts and holding the flimsy defence.

Dumb: Shaun Harrington comes alarmingly close to the tiger shark which he attempted to fend off with a bird cage

He holds the bird cage to camera when an eight foot shark comes out of nowhere and charges right at him, narrowly missing the adrenalin junkie as he shields himself with the bird cage.

‘I just thought, “I gotta get out of here”,’ Mr Harrington said of the experience in an interview with Channel Nine’s Today.

‘I saw the shark coming and threw the budgie cage in front of it and it just bounced off it. I thought I would just jump in, get a couple of shots and hop out but the thing just went crazy.

‘It wigged out and came at me. It's probably one of the dumbest things I've ever done.’  

Twin brothers Shaun and Dean were sitting in 1km deep waters off Snapper Rocks in Coolangatta when they decided to shoot the stunt.

Mr Harrington jumped into the water with the shark that had been caught by a professional fisherman. He had originally intended to wear the bird cage on his head.

Defence: The daredevil brandishes a $50 bird cage he hoped to use to fend off the creature

Attack: He hurls the flimsy cage at the shark as it moves in at ferocious speed, creating a splash

Close encounter: The swimmer looks deeply shocked as the shark passes alongside

The extreme video was shot for the brothers' surfing and fishing clothing label, The Mad Hueys, and mad they proved themselves to be as Mr Harrington came frightfully close to the giant man-eater just moments after diving in.

In hindsight, Mr Harrington has admitted the stunt was, ‘not the smartest thing’ and said he now finds himself in trouble with his wife.

‘I'm pretty much in the dog house', he said. ‘I'm thinking of renovating (it) at the moment and putting a pool table in there,’ he said.

The Harrington brothers bragged about their near miss in a comment posted below their YouTube video.

'Cage diving 1km of (sic) the Gold Coast most famous point break Snapper Rocks, a monster, 10 foot Tiger shark got way to (sic) close and almost took me leg off,' it reads.

'Luckely (sic) my trusty bird cage saved me in the end. I thought I was goin (sic) to die.'

Mr Harrington had initially planned to wear the flimsy looking bird cage on his head for the stunt, but didn't expect the Tiger shark to lunge right at him
