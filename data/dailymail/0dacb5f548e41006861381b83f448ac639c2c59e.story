Her hair was looking perfect beneath the sparkling tiara. The beautician had done her spray-on tan, nails and fake lashes, and outside, the limousines were already waiting.

Beth Woolley felt particularly special in her £200 sequinned dress and now she was ready to go to the prom.

This was how an 11-year-old celebrated her last day at primary school – thanks to a proud mum who splashed out £1,000 to make sure her daughter shone at the end of term ball. 

Beth's huge prom extravaganza included this £200 dress and three limousines

In an outing that might have come straight from High School Musical, Beth joined 19 classmates for the kind of juvenile extravaganza that is catching on in Britain – even for pre-teen schoolchildren. The prom phenomenon has become popular after being imported from the US, where it was intended for 16-year-olds.

In Tipton, West Midlands, however, they appear to have turned the clock forward a little.

Aimee Woolley took an extra job as a cleaner to raise enough money to pay for the day of her daughter’s dreams. They began planning her appearance at the junior prom as soon as they got the date for the £15-a-head party for pupils leaving Great Bridge Primary.

The prom, which was organised by parents, not the school, was arranged for Year Six pupils moving to secondary schools.

Dress - £200

Bag - £20

Shoes - £30

Jewellery - £10

Kate's Magic Hair and Beauty - £140

Perfume - £42

Photographer - £200

Cars - £300

Red Carpet - £20

Drinks - £23

Ticket - £15 

Nineteen giggling girls met at a nearby house to enjoy non-alcoholic sparkling drinks from champagne flutes at a red-carpet gathering, pictured by a professional photographer. Then a trio of white, pink and silver limousines took them to the party venue, a local pub.

It was the climax of Beth’s big day – but the preparation had started long before. She and her mother, a school dinner lady, chose the satin and royal blue netting dress online and ordered shoes and a clutch bag to match.

Make-up artist Kate Hadley visited the family home a month in advance to trial hair and make-up styles.

Then she spent six hours getting Beth ready, spread over two visits – one on the eve of the prom, another on the day of the big event. For three months, Mrs Woolley had been getting up at 5am, to start work at 6am, cleaning a factory for two hours. 

Then she returned to take Beth to school, did the housework – and headed back out to her full-time job before 11am. Was it all worth it? ‘Every penny,’ said Mrs Woolley, 36. ‘I just wanted to give my daughter the biggest, best prom she could imagine.’

As over-the-top as it might seem, Beth's story is no way unique.

It seems that proms to mark the end of primary school are
the latest pre-teen craze and the hype has been building for a few years.

End-of-primary school proms aren’t just growing in numbers,
but also in glitz, glamour and expense.

The BBC aired a documentary called Pre-teen Proms, which
told the story of the children at two schools in the three months running up to
this latest rite of passage.

The children demanded ‘pamper parties, horse-drawn
carriages, limos, Maseratis, red carpets and non-alcoholic cocktails - not to
mention prizes for prom king, prom queen and couple most likely to get married.’
And the parents had little choice but to stump up the cash.

Netmums, a discussion forum for mothers, was quick to catch
onto the trend, writing on its site: ‘On Netmums over the years we've heard of
OTT proms - with parents spending a small fortune on dresses and tuxedos,
limousines and even a helicopter to make a grand entrance!

'Beauty salons have
seen a surge in children being booked in for tans and make-up sessions to look
their best at the prom.'

It is also a hot topic on parenting forum Mumsnet. One user
posted: ‘Today [my son] brought home a letter informing us that to celebrate
year 6 leaving, they are having a prom. He is horrified, as apparently a lot of
the girls are insisting on dates. DS would rather lick his own foot than be
seen publicly with a girl, what with him being 11 and all.'

'Tonight
 the fb
discussions have started between parents arranging limos. Limos for 
11-year-olds. Surely this is beyond bats*** crackers? Is this insanity 
normal now? What's
wrong with a disco and a handful of Haribo ? Bewildered.’

An equally unimpressed mother called Josephine responded:
‘Total waste of time. "Proms" are one of the worst things to happen
to British schools in the last 20 years. They should be banned.’

While Startail added: ‘Leaving six form fine, when you have
the figure for suites and long dresses. Any younger no,’ with Mary musing:
‘Good heavens. It will be proms for leaving nursery school next.’

And in fact, Mary could be right: Debenhams has brought out
a new range of prom dresses, with sizes starting at age four.

A spokesperson for ParentsOutloud (parentsoutloud.com) said: 'Whist I understand the reason mothers wish to give their child a very special prom night at 11-years-old this is verging on madness. 

'Having spent £1,000 for a prom to now to find in two years there will be another... this is an American trend we could have lived without; a total mass marketing event which runs on parent blackmail.

'It's impossible to not partake but it should be confined to one prom only, possibly at the end of year 11, and leave primary school children to be just that.'
