A father is about to celebrate his 'first' Christmas, after a brutal assault wiped his memory of the first 49 years of his life. 

Andy Wickens, 50, was left with amnesia after he intervened in a fight outside his home.

 Mr Wickens, from Burgess Hill, West Sussex, was punched in the face and knocked unconscious when his head hit the pavement.

When he came around he could not remember getting married to his wife Petrina and did not recognise their three-year-old son, Jenson.

Since the incident in January, the father-of-three has been forced to rebuild relationships with friends and family, supported by a wife he doesn't remember.

Mrs Wickens, 43, said: 'It was outside his own house, he was cut by a punch to the head and had five stitches.'

'He fell to the ground and smacked his head.'

She is mother to three-year-old Jenson and has two children from a previous marriage, while Mr Wickens also has two daughters from a previous marriage.

She continued: 'He can't remember anybody - not even his own daughters. It has been horrible.

'He knows who I am now, but he can't remember getting married and he doesn't recognise our son.

'He doesn't remember going to school, he doesn't remember his brother and he doesn't remember the birth of his own son.

She added: 'He is not the same man he used to be. 

'He doesn't eat the same food or watch the same television programmes. 

'We have had to get to know each other all over again.

'This year will be like his first Christmas, which is exciting but very sad at the same time.'

Mr Wickens, a vehicle plant worker, was fixing a car outside his home when he was met by a group of bystanders who watched him work.

Later that night two teenagers started acting aggressively towards some of the youngsters in the group.

After trying to defend the children, a heated argument broke out for about 15 minutes which resulted in Mr Wickens being violently attacked.

He was rushed to hospital where he stayed for six hours receiving stitches.

When he woke up, his family were panicked when he didn't recognise them, but doctors reassured them, saying his memory would gradually return.

But after months passed and he still could not remember, experts re-assessed and now say tit is unlikely his memory will ever return.

A 17-year-old man is due to appear in court in April charged with carrying out the assault, which has left Mr Wickens with amnesia and anxiety about leaving the house.

He now works from home and is visited by friends who reintroduce themselves in the hopes of rebuilding their friendship from scratch.

Mr Wickens says he is grateful for his family's support. 'It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life,' he said. 'I look at photos of me from the past but they do not bring back any recollections.' He is pictured getting ready for Christmas with his wife (left) and son (centre)

Mrs Wickens, who claims her husband's attacker was drunk and high on drugs, said: 'He has got to know us all again over the year and is building up relationships with his friends, but a lot of people keep away.

'They are worried about him not recognising them. It's such a shame, and he's missed out on so much, like his grand-daughter's birth.

'He's completely lost the confidence he used to have.'

Mr Wickens said being unable to remember the past is terrifying.

He said: 'It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life.

'I look at photos of me from the past but they do not bring back any recollections.

'I am so grateful to Petrina and my friends and family for sticking by me.'
