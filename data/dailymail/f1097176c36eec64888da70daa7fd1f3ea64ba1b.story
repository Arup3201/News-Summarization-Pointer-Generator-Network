Nine in ten women admit they carry more than ten items of junk in their handbags and yet almost the same amount never carry that one fail-safe essential - cash!

Despite products such as smartphones getting smaller and lighter year on year, totes are now heavier than ever.

The average bag weighs in at an average 5.4lbs filled with all its contents, which is the equivalent of a small dog.

A new survey polled 3,000 British women reminiscing on their handbag of the 90s compared to the essentials of today. 

Results show over the past 20 years the contents of the average woman's handbag has evolved beyond recognition. 

Our lives are now typically run by simply six essential tech items, meaning the average woman is now walking around with £1,095 on her arm.

Despite technology streamlining our everyday essentials from 14 items in 1994 to just 6 key pieces today, women insist on carrying round the 'just in case' items despite never needing to use them.

An overwhelming 73 per cent carry 10 or more items of so-called junk in their handbags.

More than half (56 per cent) of those carry spare shoes, and 36 per cent carrying around spare underwear. Yet only 23 per cent say they use these items on a regular basis.

The research highlighted the increasing dependence on technology, with 86 per cent of women relying solely on card payments, and not ever carrying cash. 

A further 94 per cent of women say they don't own an A-Z, instead depending on their phone's navigation app to get around. This is in stark contrast to women of the 90s who counted their A-Z as the most important item in their handbag after their Filofax and cash.

The smartphone ranked as the single most important item carried on a daily basis, above even cards and keys, compared with women of the 90's who did not view a mobile phone as being an everyday essential at all.

Other items now obsolete include cheque  books, music players and books. They have been replaced with credit cards, phones and e-readers.

The popularity of e-cigarettes, which provide an alternative to smoking, are replacing the cigarettes and lighter' combo as a handbag essential.

However several items have stood the test of time with painkillers, make-up and chewing gum all retaining spots in the top ten. But expensive necessities such as tablets and smartphones, have seen the average cost of a handbag's contents rise to a staggering average £1,095, with women in their 20s typically hauling thousands of pounds worth of gadgets around with them.

A spokesperson for e-cigarette brand Vapestick, which conducted the research, said: 'Technology has had a huge affect on what we all carry around with us these days, and has helped improve almost every aspect of our everyday lives.  

'It will be interesting to see how technological developments will change the contents of a typical handbag again over the next twenty years.'

Empty your bag out and chuck out any rubbish

Make technology work harder for you

We all now have phones that do a million and one things so use the features and ditch the notebook, the map, the camera - and download a book app so you don't need to carry a kindle.

Use a makeup bag

Keep all those rogue lipsticks from rolling around in your bag. 

If it's broken, throw it away

We all love to keep a great eyeshadow palette that's now cracked and leaking but it can soon make a mess of your handbag.

Use up small change

It accumulates in the bottom of your bag and ends up weighing a tonne.

Only carry what you need that day

It sounds simple but we end up carting around shoes, notebooks, books we never read - keep it light and give your back a break.

A place for everything and everything in it's place

We live life at a hundred miles an hour and end up chucking everything into the bottomless pit we call a handbag. Use the side pockets to keep what you need regularly on hand.

Swap bulky items for streamlined ones

Instead of carrying a whole makeup palette invest in handbag eyeshadow - and refill those sample size foundation bottles.

Re-evaluate  

Empty your bag out every weekend and decide what you really need and what you don't - and chuck out any rubbish. Those receipts and train tickets soon mount up.
