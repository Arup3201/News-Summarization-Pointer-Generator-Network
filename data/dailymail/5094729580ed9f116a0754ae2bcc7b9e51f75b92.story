Arsene Wenger would have been a cigarette and blindfold away from the firing line had Arsenal started  as diabolically as they did against Stoke City at the Britannia just one month ago.

There, Arsenal were 3-0 down by half-time, their frail defence unable to cope with the presence of Peter Crouch and the runs behind of Bojan Krkic.

There was no such problem at the Emirates with a back four consisting of Per Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal and Hector Bellerin, replacing Mathieu Debuchy after 13 minutes, as they got revenge for the humiliation felt on December 6.

One difference between then and now is Koscielny. The 29-year-old was left on the substitutes' bench at the Britannia. Not this time.

Without him Arsenal's win percentage is just 33 per cent, they concede 1.9 goals per game and they have three clean sheets since August 2013.

With him it rises to 70 per cent, they concede just 0.7 and Stoke was their 20th clean sheet. 

Koscielny got his reward, too, creating and scoring Arsenal's opening goal with a free header after just six minutes. 

Stoke relied on set pieces, knowing you simply don't out-pass Wenger's Arsenal. 

Their reputation is for being overly physical, and Ryan Shawcross their cheerleader. 

Debuchy discovered that, receiving an unnecessary push from Marko Arnautovic to hit the electronic advertising boards and suffer a shoulder injury to complicate Wenger's  options.

But it was Crouch vs Mertesacker that would also determine whether Arsenal could claim just their sixth Barclays Premier League clean sheet. A 6ft 7in striker against his 6ft 6in marker.

The first test soon arrived. Hands all over one another, grappling in the box before the ball had even been delivered. 

But Stoke tried something new.

It was cut back for Glenn Whelan instead of being thrown into the melee, though the 30-year-old midfielder hit it high, wide, and into the stands. Mark Hughes looked disgusted. No more of those, the Stoke manager shouted in more colourful language.

Then, in first half stoppage time, Crouch finally had a header. It was the first time he'd been given the chance, though it did not trouble David Ospina on his full Premier League debut.

Ospina needed protection. Stoke needed to test the rookie. They never got the chance. Even Bellerin and Monreal were given the freedom of the wing, dominating both the left and right.

And so, while Wenger may be looking longingly towards John Terry at Stamford Bridge, the man he feels is preventing traditional English defenders from becoming extinct, the Frenchman was given no scares from his back four against Stoke this time.

Glenn Hoddle on defensive weakness

'They’ve not gone man for man really on defending, it’s always been zonal so they can get caught out.'

Jamie Carragher on set pieces

'Set pieces are a weak spot. The little players like Carzola or Rosicky aren’t going to offer you a lot defensively so you need your taller players, like Mertersacker to come in and take responsibility.' 

Glenn Hoddle on Stoke's danger man

'Stoke have got players like Bojan who can come in and get in behind the defence, in those pockets and that’s what they’ve got to watch out for.'
