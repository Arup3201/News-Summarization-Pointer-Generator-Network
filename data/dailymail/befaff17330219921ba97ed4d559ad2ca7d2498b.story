He's spent his career playing despicable characters - a rapist in Doctors, a homophobe in Hollyoaks, an abusive boyfriend in Casualty, and now Ross Barton, Emmerdale's womanising crook.

But Michael Parr couldn't be happier. 'I think it's better to play baddies,' says the 27-year-old St Helens-born actor. 'They're always in the thick of the action and you get all these wicked things to say and do.'

As Emmerdale's resident bad boy Ross, he's had his fair share. Ross arrived in the village a year ago, attacking Laurel Thomas and stealing her car. Since then he's been shot in a drug-gang dispute, bungled a robbery with corrupt cop Donna Windsor, and is now falling for her.

Michael Parr insists that, in real life, he doesn't live up to his bad boy character

'Ross is great to play – he's someone you love to hate,' says Michael. 'And even though he does horrible things, now and then he has a lighter side.

'The lines they give me are absolute gold dust. I don't know what it is about me that gets me chosen for these roles. I think I have a menacing stare that puts the wind up people – that's all I can put it down to.'

New York or Dubai? I go to New York all the time because my mum's family come from there.Curry or pizza? Pizza. I had one last night, and the night before, and the night before that - seriously! Beer or spirits? G&T in the summer, but lager the rest of the time. Pub or club? At 27 I already feel I'm older than everyone else in clubs, so I'm becoming a pub person.Oasis or Nirvana? My first album was Nevermind by Nirvana. I like walking with aggressive music, like rock and hip-hop, in my headphones.Designer clothes or high street? I prefer plain clothes to labels.Football or boxing? I did Thai boxing for years and love watching pretty much any kind of martial art.

In real life, Michael couldn't be more different from his on-screen character.

After graduating from drama school aged 21 and while auditioning for acting roles, he worked as a teaching assistant in special needs schools in London.

'Some days it could be the hardest job I've ever done, but it was also incredibly rewarding,' he recalls.

'When you see the children are learning, and you're growing very fond of them, no other job can compare. I think I was a positive role model,' Michael says proudly. 'I'm still in contact with some of them and write job references for them.

'But they made more of an impression on me! The main thing I took from it is to never feel sorry for myself again. Lots of them had problems at home, so coming to school was a major issue, but they were still excited to be there. It gave me another outlook on life.'

But Michael's main goal was always acting and after landing minor roles in other TV soaps and dramas he beat off dozens of rivals for the part of Ross. It came just in time for his biggest fan to see him perform in a major soap.

'My grandma sadly passed away at Christmas, but it meant she got to see me on screen and she had the ultimate bragging rights at church,' he smiles.

Michael's acting success is even more remarkable given that he's dyslexic. 'I've always got by,' he says. 'Reading scripts is fine. But if you asked me to do a presenting job, reading an autocue, I just wouldn't have a hope.'

He says his hectic schedule leaves little time for romance. 'I've had girlfriends, but nothing too serious as at the moment I'm so busy at work! But never say never...'
