Betty Rose, a tattoo artist based in Brooklyn, New York sees hundreds of clients interested in getting one done.

Rose has an etching of her own feline friend on her arm and got it after her pet died. 

She said: 'I was saving this spot on my arm for her and I got it a couple of months after she passed and it's a stylized portrait which means it's her likeness, it's not exactly her.'

She started working at a tattoo parlor in Williamsburg two years ago called Eight of Swords.

It is here that she has made 'cattoos' her trademark design.

David C. Wallin, owner of Eight of Swords tattoo shop said: 'Cat tattoos happened, but it  was more rare. 

'They tended to be serious, in black and grey, Betty is making it more lively.'
