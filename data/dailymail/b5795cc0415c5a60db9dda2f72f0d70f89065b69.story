Watching Blue Peter after school was a rite of passage for generations of children who dreamed of being awarded one of the show's iconic badges.

But now the days of learning to make toys and games using ‘sticky-back plastic’ and toilet rolls appear to be on the way out.

The numbers watching the show have fallen by two-thirds since it was relegated from BBC1 to the Corporation’s’ dedicated children’s channel CBBC last year.

Hugely popular: John Noakes, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves in the early 1970s

Losing its appeal: The show's current presenters Helen Skelton and Barney Harwood

Blue Peter, which was once watched by eight million and celebrates 50 years of handing out its iconic badge today, now attracts an average audience of just 100,000 viewers.

This compares to more than 340,000 who tuned in for each episode in 2012 when it was still being shown on the BBC’s main channel.

The decision to drop the much-loved show from BBC1 sparked controversy at the time.

Filming had already moved from Television  Centre, the London home  of Blue Peter’s famous garden, to Salford, and critics claimed the show was being watered-down.

Last year the programme, which first aired in 1958, was also cut to just one show per week hosted by two presenters.

It has previously had four presenters and was broadcast three times a week.

Last night, Valerie Singleton, 76, who presented the show for a decade from 1962, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I haven’t understood many of the decisions the BBC has made in the past few years – including the move to Salford.

‘It is sad but all good things  come to an end eventually and maybe it’s finally time to say that Blue Peter has had its day.

‘Everyone has such fond memories of the show but  I just think kids have got so many other things to distract them these days.’

Peter Duncan, 59, who was a Blue Peter presenter for five years over two spells in the 1980s, added: ‘Blue Peter was the first programme that had this wonderful idea of interaction – it wasn’t about phoning a telephone line to give a quid to Simon Cowell. The show was interacting with children with  its appeals.’

The BBC sparked controversy in December 2011 when it announced that Blue Peter, now presented by Barney Harwood and Helen Skelton, would be aired first on CBBC and then repeated on BBC1 a day later. The Corporation risked further fury by stopping screening repeats on BBC1 altogether last year.

Last night a BBC spokeswoman said that only 57,000 children aged six to 12 watched the show when it was aired on BBC1, but now it is screened on CBBC more children in that age group watch it. She said: ‘Far from being in decline, Blue Peter is growing in popularity with children and we’re delighted by its success.

‘And children are finding even more ways to interact with the show – 80,000 visit the website each week and we receive about 2,000 letters and emails every week.’
