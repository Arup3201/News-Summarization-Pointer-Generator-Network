Shoppers are frantically spending close to £500,000-a-minute online today as the rush to buy Christmas presents peaked on what experts call Manic Monday.

Millions of shoppers will splurge around £110 each on average  with spending sprees expected to peak at around 7am this morning, at  Midday and finally around 9pm.

Retailers said that Manic Monday - the second Monday in December has overtaken Cyber Monday - the first Monday in December - as the busiest internet shopping day in Britain.

Amazon said today they are 'ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered' today with pictures  showing how their giant warehouse in Swansea is packed with goods and staff.

The site is a quarter of a mile long from end to end and occupies 800,000 square feet -  the size of 11 football pitches - and is packed with thousands of workers.

UK consumers are expected to spend an astonishing £470,000 a minute on gifts - or £676million in total today on Christmas gifts for their friends and loved-ones.

Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day. 

Analysts believe that in total £4.7billion will be spent on online gifts this Christmas in Britain and the rise of Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Manic Monday could kill off the traditional Boxing Day sales. 

British retailers are expecting 151million visits to their websites, according to data firm Experian and online retailing trade association IMRG.

They expect online traffic to be up by 26 per cent on the same day last year, with shoppers spending an average of £470,000 a minute.

In comparison, the two companies predicted consumers would spend £556 million on Black Friday and £650 million on Cyber Monday.

But consumers exceeded predictions, splurging on a shopping spree worth an estimated £810 million on Black Friday and £720 million on Cyber Monday.

Experts identified Manic Monday last year as the key online shopping date ahead of Christmas as consumers left their shopping later because of increased confidence in delivery networks and click-and-collect services to get gifts to them before the holidays.

Huge: In order to cope with all the orders the Swansea warehouse occupies 800,000 square feet and is the size of 11 football pitches

Well stocked: The shelves need to be dozens of feet high and thousands of workers are needed to keep it running over Christmas

Sea change: Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day

In detail: Experts believe sales for Christmas gifts will rocket on several key days, peaking on Manic Monday, December 8 

It is also thought to be fuelled by the widespread use of mobile technology, while the Centre for Retail Research has suggested that the spending can be attributed to shoppers buying early out of fear that the items they want will sell out.

Number of online shoppers: Six million 

Average spend:  Around £110 each

Age bracket: Majority are between 25 and 34

Peak times: 7am, Midday and 9pm

Total spend: £676million - £470,000 per min

Retailer website hits: 151million - up 26%

Christmas spending: £4.7billion this year

The heavy discounting offered by retailers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday is not expected to be a feature of Manic Monday, but many more websites than usual are offering free delivery and are pushing the message that goods will be delivered in time for Christmas.

Experian Marketing Services senior retail consultant James Miller said: 'Christmas 2014 is on track to be another record breaking year for online retail in the UK.

'Continuing a trend we identified last year, Cyber Monday will no longer be the busiest pre-Christmas online shopping day, with Manic Monday expected to take the lead.

'With increased confidence in the standard of delivery services and click and collect, we expect to see people break away from traditional shopping habits.'

Professor Josh Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Manic Monday will be a significant day but I don't expect to see the scale of price cutting that was evident on Black Friday.

'There will still be the discounts but most of the sales will be down to shoppers worried that certain items could be out of stock, as well as making sure they are delivered in time for Christmas.'

Starting again: Customers pushed each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could be even bigger

A Waitrose spokesman told MailOnline that the Heston from Waitrose Ultimate Chocolate Bar has been one of its best pre-Christmas sellers so far.

Sales are up 56 per cent week-on-week, and the retail giant said it has had to double its orders for the £9.99 product to keep up with rising demand.

In addition, sales last week from Waitrose Cellar – its online wine site - were up 40 per cent on last year as customers stocked up on alcohol.
