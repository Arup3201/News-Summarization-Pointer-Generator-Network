Adam Lallana has admitted it would be a 'remarkable achievement' for Liverpool to finish in the top four of the Barclays Premier League this year.

Liverpool ended two points behind winners Manchester City last season, though manager Brendan Rodgers secured the consolation of Champions League football after a five-year absence.

The Reds are languishing in the bottom half of the table - 18 points adrift of Premier League pacesetters Chelsea - and Lallana feels a top-four finish is now their priority.

'We still think we can finish in the top four and I think that would be a remarkable achievement considering we've been in the Champions League,' the attacking midfielder told the BBC.

'But we don't want to look that far and we want to get back to winning ways.'

Rodgers has overseen just four wins in 11 games this season, and the Reds travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on Sunday.

It is a stadium that may bring up bad memories for Liverpool, having let slip a 3-0 lead in the final 11 minutes to draw 3-3 and all but surrender the title to Manuel Pellegrini's City.

But Lallana, a £25million signing from Southampton during the summer, insists it is an opportunity for Liverpool to get their season back on track.

'With a game against Crystal Palace it's a great chance for us to get three points and start a run,' the 26-year-old said.

'(Silverware) should be the target for us. We want to pick up a trophy and the manager said that he felt that since he's come in the team has improved but still without winning a trophy. That's definitely the target.'
