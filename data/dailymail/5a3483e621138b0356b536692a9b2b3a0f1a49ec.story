A U.S. Air Force spy plane avoided a run-in with the Russian military just one day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a suspected missile allegedly fired by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.

CNN reports that the RC-125 Five Joint evaded the Russians by flying into Swedish airspace without Sweden’s permission.

The plane may have traveled into other countries' airspace as well and it's unclear as to whether the plane had permission to do so.

Avoided danger: An RC-135 Rivet Joint Reconnaissance aircraft avoided a dangerous run in with a Russian jet on July 18 by by flying into Swedish air space

CNN reports that a U.S. plane was flying in international airspace to eavesdrop on the Russian military on July 18.

This is just one day after the Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed down in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board the commercial flight.

The Russians began tracking the U.S. spy plane with land-based radar and even sent a fighter jet to intercept the U.S. plane, said an official on Saturday.

Once the crew on board the spy plane realized they were being tracked, they tried their best to get out of the area as soon as possible.

The closest escape from the Russians was in Swedish airspace where they entered without gaining clearance with the country first.

CNN reports that the United States is speaking with Sweden about the fact that they may need to enter Swedish territory in the event the U.S. needs to avoid the Russian military in the future.

The breach of territory was first reported by the Swedish Media outlet DN.se. But Russian officials have not yet replied with their reaction.

'We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise,' said the U.S. State Department.

This is the second potentially dangerous run in the U.S. has had with the Russians in two months.

On April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet nearly collided with a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan,

Even though Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter one another, the land radar activity by the Russians in this particular instance was 'unusual.'

Pro-Russian rebels still deny that they shot down the Malaysian plane and say that Russia didn't supply them with equipment to shoot it down.
