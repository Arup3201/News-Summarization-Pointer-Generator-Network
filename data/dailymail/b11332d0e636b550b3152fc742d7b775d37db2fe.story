A British mountain guide was among nine climbers killed by the ‘deadliest avalanche in years’ in the French Alps yesterday.

Roger Payne, 55, who wrote a training programme on avoiding avalanches, was one of three Britons swept more than 600ft to their deaths by a huge wall of snow.

The victims were part of a group of 28 experienced climbers who had been attempting one of the most dangerous ascents in Europe to reach the summit of Mont Blanc.

The climbers were hit by a 60ft high 
and 500ft wide wall of snow as they climbed 14,649ft Mont Maudit – which
translates as ‘cursed peak’ – to reach Mont Blanc. Police in the nearby
town of Chamonix confirmed that three Germans, two of them women, two 
Spanish and one Swiss victim were among the dead.

Nine others were airlifted to hospital with broken bones, dislocations and deep cuts.

Last night two other British climbers
who had been missing feared dead walked into Chamonix police station. 
By nightfall all the climbers on the trip had been accounted for.

Dramatic pictures taken minutes after
the disaster by mountaineer Klemen Gricar show injured climbers huddled
under survival blankets awaiting rescue. Mr Gricar, a guide who works 
for the British-run company Mountain Tracks, was part of a following 
group and was one of the first on the scene.

He said: ‘I saw people coming down 
the mountain from the accident. Some of them were bleeding and there 
were bad injuries – dislocated shoulders, broken legs. There were dead 
people as well, it was a horrible accident. We helped the injured 
climbers and mountain guides but the conditions were difficult. It was 
clear but there were very strong winds.’

Rescue: The climbers affected by the avalanche were part of a 28-member group of experienced mountaineers

Aftermath: Huge banks of snow blanket the north face of Mont Maudit minutes after the deadly avalanche

Snow slide: Experts said the avalanche was caused when one of climbers dislodged a 1ft-deep bank of snow on Mont Maudit

He said the climbers had been roped 
together on very short ropes because of the nature of the climb, so 
‘wouldn’t have been able to do much’ when the avalanche hit.

Climber Cesar Gonzalez, 35, was 100 
yards away when the avalanche fell. The web designer from Madrid said: 
‘We heard some crying and when we got up the slope we looked down and 
saw there had been an avalanche.

‘We could see maybe five or six 
bodies in the snow, and six or seven people with broken arms or legs. No
one who was there had escaped injury, though some only had cuts on 
their faces and were walking around.’

British mountaineer Kenton Cool, 
based in Chamonix, said: ‘It would have been a huge wave of snow. The 
climbers making their way up the slope would have had no chance.’

French rescuers believe the disaster unfolded after one of the lead climbers dislodged a bank of snow.

At the scene: The climbing route where emergency crews focused their searches is said to be one of the most dangerous in Europe

The 28 climbers, who had split into 
two groups, had spent Wednesday evening sleeping at Cosmiques Refuge, a 
climbers’ hut at 11,800ft.

They left the hut at 1.30am and began their ascent in temperatures of minus 5C (23F).

When they left there were no weather 
reports warning of avalanche risks, officials say. However gusts of wind
of up to 43mph may have created huge walls of snow, known as wind 
slabs, which are extremely dangerous when they collapse.

The group were trying to climb up a 
steep snow-covered ridge on the north face of Mont Maudit at 13,120ft 
when the avalanche struck. One of the injured climbers called the 
emergency services on his mobile phone at 5.25am.

Another local guide said that some of
the injured were dug out of the snow ‘very quickly’ by the first rescue
teams on the scene.

One of the first to arrive was a 
British guide Victor Saunders and his doctor client. They had left two 
hours later than the avalanched party after the guide expressed concerns
about the weather. They gave first aid to the survivors and alerted the
rescue services.

More than 50 mountain rescuers and 
police using teams of dogs and heat-seeking devices spent the day 
searching the snow in an attempt to find any bodies buried. Teams of 
rescuers from across the border in Italy joined the search.

The Mont Blanc massif, although hugely popular with tourists, is an extremely dangerous climbing area which takes over 100 lives every year.

The route has some of the most easily accessible mountains in the world, but has hidden perils due to its changeable climate.

Unprecedented storms, as well as falling blocks and lightning strikes, all contribute to the dangers of the mountain range.

In August 2008 eight climbers – three Swiss, one German, and four Austrian - died in a similar accident on the nearby Mont Blanc du Tacul.

And a year earlier there was an even more catastrophic death toll, as nearly 30 were killed on Mont Blanc and its satellite peaks in July 2007.

More recently, a Norwegian cross-country skier died in April after being caught up in an avalanche on Mont Blanc, only about a month after a Canadian skier died after plunging into a 20-metre (65-foot) crevice on the mountain.

The latest tragedy on Mont Maudit - literally meaning 'Cursed Mountain' - is the biggest disaster to happen in the French Alps in a decade.

Last night members of the close-knit climbing community were paying their respects to Mr Payne, 55, and the other climbers.

Dave Turnbull, chief executive of the
British Mountaineering Club, said Mr Payne was a former BMC general 
secretary and president of the British Mountain Guides.

‘Roger was one of the UK’s most 
enthusiastic and respected climbers with a track record of Alpine and 
Himalayan mountaineering stretching back to the 1980s,’ he said. ‘Our 
thoughts are with Roger’s friends and family, in particular his wife 
Julie-Ann.’ John Cousins, from the British Mountain Guides Association, 
said: ‘He was such an energetic character. He really was a truly 
remarkable and amazing individual.’

Mr Payne, originally from Hammersmith in West London, was an expert guide with an intimate knowledge of the Alpine range.

The climber, who lived in Leysin, 
Switzerland, with his wife, also a mountaineer, had been on 20 
expeditions to some of the world’s highest and most challenging peaks.

His avalanche training programme is used to teach hundreds of students each year.

Last night members of the British Foreign Office arrived in Chamonix to offer assistance.

The two British climbers who escaped 
had taken a different route, said Sir Peter Ricketts, the British 
Ambassador to France, who last night arrived in Chamonix to offer 
assistance. A local official added: ‘They were part of the original 
party but for some reason they changed their minds. They must have had 
some premonition.’

Recovery: Five Britons are said to be among those still missing from the group of 28 climbers, as helicopters rushed to the scene

One of the dead Spanish climbers was 
Joaquin Aguado, a 51-year-old father of two who was an experienced 
climber and head of the fire services mountain rescue team at Madrid 
national park. In a bizarre twist of fate he and another Spanish victim 
had swapped places with two fellow countrymen to take part in the 
ill-fated trip.

The avalanche is the worst to hit the Chamonix community since 1999 when 12 were killed in their chalets in Montroc.
