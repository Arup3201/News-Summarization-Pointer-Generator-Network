She's Chelsea's resident fashionista who spearheaded the fedora hat trend and dishes out daily style advice, so it's hardly surprising that Rosie Fortescue has been snapped up to front a new campaign.

The long-standing Made In Chelsea star has been unveiled as the face of Pretaportobello.com's new initiative, MarketSpace - an e-tailer that allows up-and-coming independent designers to trade directly with customers.

The brand hand-picked stylish Rosie because she is apparently a big supporter of British design talent.

Fashionable face: Made In Chelsea starlet Rosie Fortescue has been unveiled as the face of Pretaportobello.com's new initiative, MarketSpace - an e-tailer that allows up-and-coming independent designers to trade directly with customers - and she says she is a huge supporter of fledgling designers

Speaking about her involvement, the 24-year-old, who recently unveiled her own fashion range, told MailOnline: 'Supporting up and coming designers is super-important to me and I actually get contacted by a lot of new designers via my blog. 

'I feature them as often I can as I think it's important to show them support.

'There's an amazing array of young design talent on board, helping to give them a platform to get into the mainstream market.'

Rosie recently curated and modelled her debut clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique - and every piece stayed true to the tailored and chic style she's made her own.

Sharing her go-to style formula, she said: 'It's all about finding clothes that fit my body. It's incredibly important to wear items that compliment your figure.  

'I do often stick to the same style when shopping which leaves me with a wardrobe full of muted colours and leather trousers so I do try and think outside the box and be creative.' 

Perfect fit: Rosie said it's essential to find clothes that fit your body. 'It's incredibly important to wear items that compliment your figure,' she advises

Star style: Rosie is a huge fan of tailored pieces and recently chanelled her style expertise into her own range for Lipstick Boutique 

The reality TV star cites her statement Christmas party outfit as a tuxedo suit with a camisole top, sexy heels, statement necklace and clutch bag. 

'It's a go-to outfit for me as I am not the biggest fan of dresses,' she said. 'Don't get me wrong, when I find a dress I adore I really do enjoy wearing it.'

Despite unveiling her debut range earlier this year, Rosie says her fashion coup is yet to come.

'My favourite fashion moment is yet to come I think. I do always enjoy dressing in brands for London Fashion Week and attending all the shows.

'It's a way for me to really play around with style and dress to my exact mood and feelings,' she said.

Citing her icons as Olivia Palermo and Abbey Clancy, Rosie reveals that her best friend and fellow fashion designer Millie Mackintosh had a glance through her look book before it launched and the pair exchanged notes. 'We have been wearing each others ranges,' she added.

Rosie is one of the original Made In Chelsea cast members and as well as seeing her star rise, she says her style has changed, too.

'I have learnt a lot about my body and what suits my shape. For example, I am pale so I would never wear neon.'

She's extremely grateful to the E4 show for providing her with so many opportunities, explaining: 'It's full of drama and fun and we had an amazing time in New York. I am so proud and pleased that it's all going so well.'
