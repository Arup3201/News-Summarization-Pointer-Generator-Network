The police unit at the centre of the Plebgate scandal was rocked by fresh controversy last night as it emerged officers are suspected of exchanging ‘extreme pornography’.

Four officers in Scotland Yard’s elite diplomatic protection group are under investigation after shocking images were apparently found on mobile phones.

Three were arrested and a fourth was interviewed under caution in the latest blow to hit the beleaguered unit.

The images were discovered during the exhaustive £250,000 internal investigation into the controversial Andrew Mitchell affair, known as Operation Alice.

Every officer in the diplomatic protection group, which is responsible for securing Downing Street and other diplomatic addresses, was questioned.

It is understood the images, described as of an ‘extreme sexual nature’ but not involving children, were found during forensic analysis of mobile phones.

One officer has been suspended and three others placed on restricted duties while a file has been passed to prosecutors for consideration.

At the centre of the misconduct 
investigation is the question of whether the images were exchanged while
 the officers were on or off duty.

The revelations pile fresh embarrassment on the force, just days after another officer from the unit was jailed for 12 months for lying over Plebgate.

Keith Wallis, 53, falsely claimed to have witnessed the clash between Mr Mitchell, then The Tory chief whip, and a colleague who was on duty at the Downing Street gates.

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to the senior politician, and the public, this week saying officers must uphold the highest standards of integrity. He added: ‘Where officers break the law they must expect to be held to account and answer for what they have done.’

The three officers were arrested on December 19 on suspicion of being involved in the possession and distribution of obscene images via mobile phones.

The offence carries a maximum penalty of three years’ jail.

The officers were taken to a Central London police station to be questioned and search warrants executed at their homes.

On January 8, a fourth officer was interviewed under caution ‘in connection with the investigation’ and placed on restricted duties.

The Met referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) which ordered it to investigate the matter itself.

A Met spokesman declined to discuss why the force had not revealed the investigation or arrests until contacted by The Times newspaper.
