If we believe in redemption, Ched Evans MUST be allowed to play football again 

Beware the fury of the mob! It will only turn Ched Evans into the victim

Jim McMahon, leader of Oldham Council, sounded genuinely shocked. ‘In recent days we’ve seen a horrendous “trial by social media” with intimidation, abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow,’ he said. 

‘I am urging people on all sides of this debate to please now take stock, show some restraint and calm.’

Too late. The time to take stock was several days ago, when folk like McMahon were too busy adding their own amendments to the criminal justice system to consider much of anything.

Evans, pictured with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, issued a series of statements on Thursday

I am grateful for the support of the PFA in helping me try to return to football and continue my career. Upon legal advice, I was told not to discuss the events in question. 

This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. 

Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so. 

That the fury around the return of Ched Evans has now mutated to such an extent that it is suggested the daughter of an Oldham Athletic director was threatened with rape if Evans was employed, shows the inherent danger when leaders become followers. 

McMahon, and his fellow politicians, had the opportunity to stand foursquare behind the tenets of crime, punishment and rehabilitation, but chose easy populism instead. 

So now here we are. Ched Evans will not join Oldham after all, so the battle is won; but at what cost? Who will be thrown to the mob next, whose sentence will be morally adjusted on release, to satisfy the public whim?

At a time when McMahon could have taken stock, he instead sniffed the air and told the world: ‘I don’t believe Mr Evans would be a suitable role model and ambassador for the town, or for the long-term reputation of the club.’

He does, however, believe in rehabilitation. 

He must, because he said so in the second paragraph of Thursday’s statement, and it is not as if a principle like that would just be tossed in, another empty slogan to appease the masses.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp says convicts deserve a second chance once they have served their time

It has been widely reported that Oldham Athletic will not be signing Ched Evans, which we can now confirm.

The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result.

Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead.

As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media.

We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain.

Finally, we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period, including the club staff, who have acted with professionalism at all times.

We understand Ched has released his own statement on his website.

The club will not be making any further statement on this matter.

It says something for Britain’s political class when one of the more-rounded evaluations came from Harry Redknapp, manager of Queens Park Rangers. 

'I think it’s about getting a second chance,’ Redknapp said on Thursday. 

‘People go to prison, unfortunately a lot of them come out and somewhere along the line you’ve got to make a go of your life. What does he do?

'If he goes and works in a supermarket people are going to say “we’ve got a rapist working in the supermarket”.

‘Somewhere he’s got to work, whether that’s in football or elsewhere. He can’t just not be allowed to carry on with his life.’

That ‘unfortunately’ would suggest Redknapp is not a natural bleeding-heart liberal. 

Even he can see that society risks painting itself into a corner over Evans, though.

Still, McMahon’s initial stance no doubt got him applause in all the right places, as did the statements by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford. 

Cameron was still pontificating on Evans on Thursday in stark contrast to his views on Prince Andrew and allegations of underage sex slaves. Asked for his reaction to that story, the Prime Minister refused to comment. 

Why should he? It isn’t as if the fifth in line to the throne is a role model. 

It’s not as if he’s something very important, like Oldham Athletic’s No 9.

It is with great sadness that today I have withdrawn from talks with Oldham Athletic. I would like to thank the Club, and those who have supported me in my lawful quest to find work. I apologise to the clubs supporters, sponsors and all those effected by the last 72 hours.

Sadly the ‘mob rule’ tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldhams new stand it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.

Upon legal advice, I chose not to discuss the events in question. My silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth.

I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effect that that night in Rhyl has had on many people, especially the woman concerned.

Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.
