After Tiger Woods' former caddie made a racist remark at a awards dinner, he was condemned by the Professional Golfers Association and Tiger Woods' management team, but it's Adam Scott's lack of criticism that has people talking now.

Williams was given an award for the 
year’s best celebration - a reference to his tongue-in-cheek claim that 
his current employer Adam Scott’s victory at the Bridgestone 
Invitational in August was ‘the best win of my career’ - despite being on the bag with Woods for 13 majors.

Asked
 what the celebration was all about, Williams said:
 ‘It was my aim to shove it right up that black a**hole.’

New boss: Williams with Adam Scott  on the 16th hole during the first round of the WGC-HSBC Champions at Sheshan International Golf Club this week

Though Williams issued an apology, people are now criticizing Williams' new boss Adam Scott's lack of criticism.

Scott, who now retains the 47-year-old New Zealeander caddie, said that he disapproves of Williams' remark, but is trying to put the whole incident in the past.

'I don't think anyone condones racism in sport or anything,' Scott said.

'I don't see it being an issue moving forward,' Scott said. 'I think from my side of things and my teams, the matter has been put to bed. I've got nothing more to talk about it with anyone. So I'm moving on.'

 'I had Steve issue an apology. What more should I do?' Scott continued.

'Look, anything with Tiger involved is a story,' Scott said. 'I value Steve's contribution to my game and to have him on the bag.'

Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at Excel Sports Management, was with the golfer when he heard the news.

He said: 'It's a regrettable comment, and there's really nothing that Tiger can do or say. He's just going to move on.'

The comment was met with a mixture of laughter and shock at the ceremony, with some players turning to each other with eyes widened and jaws agape.

One caddie said: ‘Never have you been in
 a room and seen so many jaws drop at the same time. We knew he was an 
idiot but we didn’t know he was a racist idiot. I was standing next to a
 European Tour official who said, “Thank God he is not on our tour”.’

Blast: Williams and Tiger Woods worked together for more than 10 years

Approached early the next morning at breakfast, Williams was stunned to learn that British tabloids had gone with the story.

'Why would they do that?' he said. 'The whole thing was meant to be fun.'

He then posted a statement on his website saying: 'I apologise for the comments I made 
last night at the annual Caddie Awards dinner in Shanghai.

'Players and caddies look forward to 
this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. I now 
realise how my comments could be construed as racist.              

'However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologise to Tiger and anyone else I have offended.' 

The 100 caddies, players and guests in attendance had accepted their invitations on the condition they did not disclose what happened at the ceremony, held after the second round of the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament.

Williams, who could now face a ban or even the sack, had been a regular caddie 
for Woods since 1999 and helped the American to 13 majors before being 
fired in July.         

He hit out at the 
manner of the split and a month later was in the news again after his 
new employer, Scott, won the WGC Bridgestone Invitational at Akron,
 Ohio.

Centre of storm: Steve Williams stunned guests at a gala dinner with a racial slur when accepting a prize for 'best celebration'

Williams had told reporters: 'It's 
the most satisfying win I've ever had, there's no two ways about it. 
It's the greatest week of my life caddying and I sincerely mean that.' 

He later apologised for those comments, saying his emotions got the better of him.        

Williams has disputed Woods' version 
of how their partnership ended, and said he was 
short-shrifted by Woods despite his loyalty to the former No. 1 player 
during the sex scandal that derailed his career.

Scott is today preparing for his third round 
of the HSBC Champions. He is 
going for his second World Golf Championship of the year.

Woods and Scott are to be in the same
 group next week at the Australian Open, and there's chance they also 
could face off at the Presidents Cup in Melbourne the week after.

It's not the first time Williams has run into trouble for his words.

Three years ago at a dinner banquet 
in New Zealand, he made a disparaging remark about Phil Mickelson. 

Williams said it was meant in fun, although he later apologised to 
Mickelson.

Footballer John Terry allegedly made 
racist comments toward Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's 1-0 loss to 
Queens Park Rangers in a Premier League loss last month.
