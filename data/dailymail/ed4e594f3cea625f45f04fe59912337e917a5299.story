Animal welfare activists have labelled the shocking mistreatment of live Australian exports in Middle Eastern countries as 'atrocities'.

Footage released by animal activist group Animals Australia has revealed 'sickening abuse' of cattle and sheep in Gaza, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia during the Islamic festival of sacrifice known as Eid al-Adha.

During the festival, animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor, but the video footage shows such cruelty to Australian produce that the Federal regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny.

'It is nothing short of criminal, that a year on, we have again seen horrendous abuse of Australian cattle in Gaza while for the exporter legally responsible it is business-as-usual,' said Animals Australia Campaign Director Lyn White.

Animal welfare activists have labelled the shocking mistreatment of live Australian exports in Middle Eastern countries as 'atrocities'

Footage released by animal activist group Animals Australia has revealed 'sickening abuse' of cattle and sheep

The abuse occurred in Gaza, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia during the Islamic festival of sacrifice known as Eid al-Adha.

'Despite extensive evidence of recurring breaches and shocking animal welfare consequences, there has not been a single prosecution of an export company, or a single charge laid.' 

In October, Animals Australia launched the largest coordinated live export investigation in history, which uncovered not only cruelty to live exports, but a cover up of the identification of offending exporters.

The activist group pointed out that while the cruelty evidenced in the vision has come to be associated with the festival, the animal abuses have nothing to do with religion and everything to do with exporters who capitalise on the demand for live produce to slaughter en masse.

In the footage, sheep are shown to be forced onto trucks for sale with broken legs, bulls with their legs and neck strung out between poles while their necks are roughly slashed open, and bulls repeatedly stabbed in public until they are unable to stand.

Animals are also shown to have their tails broken, to be hit and made to bleed while crowds cheer, among other actions which the group have labelled   

The activist group claims that investigators looking into illegal sheep sales in Jordan found that one company was offering locals four sheep in trade for 'beating up anyone with a camera'.

During the festival, animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor, but the video footage shows such cruelty to Australian produce that the Federal regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny.

They further claim that the Australian government has 'an abundance of evidence that ear tags are being removed from sheep and cattle being illegally sold and slaughtered in Jordan, Kuwait and Gaza — to prevent identification of the exporter. Akin to a burglar wiping away their fingerprints to avoid detection, nothing has been done to curb this destruction of evidence.'

The group has named exporter Livestock Shipping Services in the investigation, claiming that the company has been implicated for at least 12 breaches of regulations in Gaza, Jordan and Kuwait. 

Meat and Livestock Australia allegedly failed to inform the Federal government that hundreds of sheep were being sold through a livestock market in Kuwait illegally, with Animals Australia claiming that this directly prevented action being taken for the animals in danger of abuse.

Australia exports up to four million sheep and cattle per year, a figure which reflects a growing concern that animals exported have allegedly been deprived of water during extreme heat and left unable to stand after suffering debilitating injuries on long haul trips.

Animals Australia have reported that nine complaints to the Department of Agriculture were lodged, and have said that the abuses could have been avoided if the Department had responded quickly and decisively.

'This shocking abuse could have been prevented had the Department of Agriculture taken strong action against exporters who have repeatedly shown a brazen disregard for regulations in these markets,' said Ms White. 

The Department of Agriculture introduced the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) in 2012 to regulate the treatment of Australian cattle and prevent them being slaughtered in unauthorised abattoirs.  

A spokesperson from the Department said that the welfare of Australian animals remained a priority for the Australian Government.

'No-one supports animal cruelty, least of all Australian farmers and exporters. The Department of Agriculture is investigating the report and will publish its findings, along with any actions taken.'

'Through the ESCAS we continue to ensure that Australian livestock exported for feeder and slaughter purposes are handled and slaughtered in accordance with international standards.'

'Australia has arguably the strictest system in the world to ensure our exported sheep and cattle are treated as humanely as possible. We are the only one of 100 countries that export livestock that seeks to ensure international animal welfare standards are met throughout the entire supply chain.'

However the activist group claim that the Department for Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, were failing to act in an organised and credible manner.

'Barnaby Joyce is overseeing a regulatory system that is shambolic and has no credibility whatsoever. The only reason the government even knows about these breaches is because of the work of a charity,' said Ms White.

'The fact that thousands of animals are continuing to be subjected to sickening cruelty in a number of markets, and yet we are seeing no commercial consequences for responsible export companies to motivate compliance, means that we are left with little choice but to relaunch our public campaign to end live export.' 

'No-one supports animal cruelty, least of all Australian farmers and exporters. The Department of Agriculture is investigating the report and will publish its findings, along with any actions taken,' said a Department spokesperson
