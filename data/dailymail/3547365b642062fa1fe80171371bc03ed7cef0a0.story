A Florida man smeared dog faeces in his mother's face after she refused to give him a shot of vodka, according to a police report.

William Jenkins was arrested yesterday on a felony domestic battery charge for pushing his mother to the floor during a row at their home.

Jenkins, 22, denied shoving his mother, but admitted he 'did rub dog defecation on her face because she yelled at him', according to a Palmetto Police Department report.

The dispute apparently ensued when his mother refused to provide him with a shot of vodka, it was reported on www.thesmokinggun.com.

Jenkins went to the back porch where his mother's dog had relieved itself, then 'reached down with his hand, pick up the dog defecation and rubbed it in his mother's face'.
