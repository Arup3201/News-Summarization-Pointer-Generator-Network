With a single fist in the air, this is how mourners chose to say a final farewell to Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier at his funeral in Paris today.

Surviving cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who drew this week's cover featuring the Prophet Mohammed, bowed his head and wept as he raised his tattooed wrist aloft. 

The defiant gesture is a fitting send-off for Charbonnier, a man who dedicated his life to living in opposition and once declared: 'I would rather die standing than live on my knees'.

Several hundred mourners crowded into the community center in Charbonnier's childhood home of Pontoise, a district of Paris synonymous with impressionist art, to wish him a final goodbye

Stephane Charbonnier, known to friends and fans as Charb, was killed on Wednesday last week after fanatical jihadi gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi opened fire inside the Charlie Hebdo offices

Charbonnier - known to his friends and fans as Charb - was born in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a small district of north-western Paris, huddled up against the Seine.

The son of a postal worker father and secretary mother, he grew up in Pontoise, an historic arrondissement several miles to the north of his birthplace, and synonymous with impressionist art.

At one time Van Gogh, Cezanne, Pissarro and Gauguin, all either lived or worked in the picturesque district, and painted its landscape.

During the service tributes were read to the man who helped revive Charlie Hebdo in 1992 along with Jean Cabut, who was also killed last week

The prestigious heritage certainly rubbed off on Charbonnier, who drew from a young age. His first drawings were published in a student magazine when he was just 14.

He went to study at the Lycée Camille Pissarro, a art college close to his home which counted the impressionist among its patrons when it opened in 1959.

After graduating he went on to study advertising, but broke off that career when he was invited to work on satirical magazine La Grosse Bertha - which translates as Big Bertha, named after the formidable First World War German artillery piece.

He joined the magazine in 1991, and made his debut as Charb with a cartoon opposing the first Gulf War.

He served just a year on Grosse Bertha's staff before a row over the magazine's political content caused several senior staff to walk, including renown cartoonist Jean 'Cabu' Cabut.

Cabu convinced Charbonnier to leave with him, and together the pair revived Charlie Hebdo, which was originally founded in 1970, but went out of print in 1981.

Cabu was one of the nine staff killed alongside Charbonnier when bloodthirsty jihadis Said and Cherif Koauchi bust into their offices last Wednesday and opened fire. 

Operating now without restrictions, Charbonnier and Cabut quickly established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of taste, while staunchly defending the right to freedom of expression.

Charbonnier was at the centre of the 2006 decision to reprint cartoons of Mohammed by Dutch illustrator Kurt Westergaard which caused international outrage.

Defiant: The raised fist gesture was a fitting send off for a man who lived his life in opposition, and once declared 'I would rather die standing than live on my knees'

After Philippe Val, another former Grosse Bertha contributor, left the magazine in 2009 it was Charbonnier who stepped in to take his place.

Ensuring the publication remained as controversial as ever, he put together an issue in which the magazine was renamed 'Sahria Hebdo', which claimed to be guest edited by Mohammed, and carried the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'.

That lead to the magazine's offices being firebombed in 2011, though at the time of that attack they were empty. The target was instead believed to be the publication's computer system.

Charbonnier was placed under police guard after death threats flooded in, and Charlie Hebdo relocated to its new premises on Rue Nicolas-Appert, where the attacks took place last week.

Refusing to bow to the threats, he published several subsequent editions featuring Mohammed including him being pushed around by a Rabbi while in a wheelchair - which he drew himself.

His defiant stance lead to several fatwas being issued against him, and in 2013 he was placed on Al Qaeda's hit-list of nine men wanted 'for crimes against Islam'.

He died last week aged 47 during the massacre at the magazine's office. Witness reports said he was the main target of the attack, and his name was called before he was shot.

He was murdered alongside Jean Cabut, 76, Elsa Cayat, 54, Philippe Honoré, 74, Bernard Maris, 68, Mustapha Ourrad, 60, Michel Renaud, 69, Bernard Verlhac, 57, and Georges Wolinski, 80.

Several hundred people attended his emotional funeral service in Pontoise today, the day after services took place for Verlhac, Wolinski, Cayat, and Franck Brinsolaro, the police protection officer assigned to look after Charbonnier. 

John Kerry was also in Paris today to pay his respects, and visited the Charlie Hebdo offices where tributes to those killed, including Charbonnier, have been attached to the walls
