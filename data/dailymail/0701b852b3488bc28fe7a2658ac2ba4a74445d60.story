Rayan Wilson (right) has been told he can carry on claiming benefits despite being filmed playing football for a pub team in a Sunday league

A man who was filmed playing football despite claiming he could often barely walk has been found not guilty of a £50,000 benefit fraud.

Rayan Wilson, 29, has the rare genetic blood condition sickle-cell anaemia.

He was granted the top rate of disability living allowance in 2003 after telling Department for Work and Pensions officials he often had to crawl rather than walk.

However, assessors became suspicious in 2011 when he told them he was working  in injury rehabilitation at Bristol Rovers  Football Club for three to seven hours a week. Investigators then filmed him making slide-tackles as star midfielder for a pub team in a Sunday football league.

Mr Wilson told Bristol Crown Court that his condition fluctuates and on many days he can only walk six to eight yards.

Prosecuting, Francisca Da Costa said: ‘He was observed playing football, running, jumping, making sliding tackles.’

But Tom Wainwright, defending, gave  evidence from sickle-cell doctors that Mr Wilson’s condition – in which the blood cannot carry enough oxygen – is variable. His clinical coordinator, Dr Mark Critchley, said Mr Wilson was admitted to hospital 19 times between 2003 and 2013.

His clinical coordinator Dr Mark Critchley said Mr Wilson was telling the truth, and had been admitted to hospital 19 times between 2003 and 2013.

Judge Michael Longman directed the 
jury to find him not guilty of three charges of dishonest representation
 from 2003 to 2011. Mr Wilson, of Bristol, said: ‘I’m relieved. I had no
 reason to lie. I hope the case raises the profile for people with 
sickle cell.’

Miss Da Costa added: 'He did not present with the medical difficulties he described.'

Mr Wilson convinced a judge that his sickle cell condition was 'fluctuating' and that on some days he was able to play football, but that on others he was unable to walk more than 19ft
