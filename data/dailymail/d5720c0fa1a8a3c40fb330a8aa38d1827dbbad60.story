A health trust which discharged more than 800 suspected cancer patients was warned about its blunders by a GP - but did nothing to stop them for a year.

An investigation has revealed a clutch of failings at the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, where 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments.

The independent probe was launched earlier this year after it was revealed at least one patient involved in the scandal had died.

Failings: 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments at the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which comprises three hospitals including Watford General (pictured)

More than 100 others may have had life-threatening delays thanks to the blunders at the Trust, which runs Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead Hospitals in Hertfordshire.

The patients failed to attend urgent cancer checkups, possibly because they did not receive appointment letters.

They should have been contacted immediately and offered another appointment within two weeks.

Instead it is thought they were either discharged or given non-urgent appointments.

Now the final report reveals a GP warned there could be a major problem in November 2012 - a full year before the Trust launched its investigation.

The GP's fears were not followed up because there were not 'appropriate systems' to deal with complaints, the report said, and there was a 'lack of continuity in leadership'.

Instead it took another wider review for the blunders to come to light.

The report said: 'In
 November 2012, [the Trust] received a GP’s formal complaint that 
patients referred with suspected cancer on a two-week wait pathway may 
have been discharged after one Did Not Attend.

'In
 response to the investigation clinicians were reminded of the policy. 
The formal complaint response in July 2013 acknowledged the issues and 
committed to actions to resolve them.

'As
 the appropriate systems were not in place to deal with complaints 
management at that time and due to a lack of continuity in leadership 
and ownership to address the issues, progress was not followed up.'

New chief: Samantha Jones ordered a review of the system for booking appointments in November

Only
 at a separate, later training session did it become apparent that 
patients were not being offered a second appointment, the report said.

'This
 was the trigger to instigate the internal incident investigation - 
Operation Bloom - in November 2013. The GP complaint was reviewed again 
as part of this investigation.'

The report, released yesterday, also revealed an audit was promised in July last year but did not happen because 'leadership changes at executive level' caused confusion as to who was in charge.

Not only were staff unsure who had the final responsibility for 'two-week wait' cancer patients - the top directors on the hospitals' board also did not know for sure who was in charge.

The report added: 'This is a complex, challenged Trust and the senior leadership prioritised the known performance issues, giving lower priority to seeking assurance that the performance measures marked green really had no problems.'

The hospital's £280,000-a-year former chief executive, Jan Filochowski, left just a month before the GP's complaint and was replaced by Samantha Jones.

Mr Filochowski joined Great Ormond Street Hospital but retired just over a year into his post, saying he wanted to focus on NHS consultancy and business books.

Ms Jones said yesterday the health trust now has a 'comprehensive cancer improvement plan' in place.

'I apologise unreservedly to the patients and families affected and wish to assure them that we have already put failsafe mechanisms in place to stop these issues arising again,' she said.

'We have published the report to share the findings with our patients and local community.

'We will continue to work in partnership with local and national health partners to ensure all aspects of the cancer referral pathway can be improved to enhance the patient care experience.'
