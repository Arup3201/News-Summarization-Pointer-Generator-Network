Graffiti artist Banksy has demanded a top-level investigation at Channel 4 after he claimed a documentary suggests he left a rival in a coma in a row about his work.

He has been involved in a tit-for-tat battle with veteran King Robbo after painting over one of his designs.

The rival suffered a mysterious head injury which has left him in a coma for the past five months.

Banksy claims a controversial Channel 4 documentary about his long-running feud with King Robbo implies he was responsible and has made a formal complaint.

Graffiti Wars, screened last month, revealed how the pair had been involved in a remarkable battle for supremacy.

Banksy has admitted painting over one of King Robbo's last-surviving pieces of art on Regent's Canal in 2009 - but claims that the work was already damaged.

He stencilled an image of a man wallpapering over the 1980s' piece, striking the first blow in the feud.

Last year King Robbo hit back and painted his name over the image.

King Robbo was found with a serious wound to his head in April - but nobody knows how it happened.

It is believed the 6ft 8in artist may have tumbled over in a freak accident.

He has been in an artificially-induced coma since April. The artist's true identity is a closely guarded secret but he is believed to have an 18-month old daughter and lives in Holloway, north London.

However, Banksy claims that the original artwork was in such a poor state of disrepair that the signature was no longer visible.

The Channel 4 documentary showed Robbo disappearing off to paint over another piece of his rival's work - but said shortly after the clip was filmed he suffered a mystery head injury.

The narrator said: 'But Robbo would never get his chance to retaliate against Banksy.

'Just days after this filming took place, he was found unconscious in the street with life-threatening head injuries and he's been in a coma ever since.'

Channel 4 fiercely deny claims that the programme suggested Banksy put his rival in a coma - and they said he was not unfairly portrayed.

It is believed that Robbo may have fallen down the stairs and banged his head - although the incident was never investigated by police.

Banksy told The Observer in a statement: 'Graffiti Wars contained some inaccuracies that I've asked to be investigated and some facts that need to be corrected.

'They alleged I painted over a piece by Robbo and led viewers to believe I had something to do with him being in a coma.

'I wish Robbo a full and speedy recovery.'

In the show, King Robbo claimed he slapped Banksy when he first met him for showing a lack of respect.

A spokesman for Channel 4 denied Banksy's claims.

He said: 'Graffiti wars in no way suggests that Banksy was responsible for the injuries sustained by King Robbo.

'The documentary clearly states that Banksy did not realise he was painting over Robbo's work and includes a picture of the deteriorated work.'
