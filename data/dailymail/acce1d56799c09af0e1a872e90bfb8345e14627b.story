A teenager who decided to teach a much younger boy a lesson by pushing him over in a park has been left with life changing injuries after a 30-strong mob took their revenge.

Hsieh Feng, 18, is said to have pushed a 10-year-old boy over in a park in Kaohsiung city, southern Taiwan, because he was being rude.

But what Hsieh had failed to realise was that the youngster was the son of a local gang boss, who did not take kindly to his pride and joy being beaten.

Mob: The 30-strong gang hunted down Hsieh Feng, who had pushed their boss's son over in the park

Brutal: They found him outside a college in Taiwan, and started beating him with clubs and fists

Indeed, the boy's father Cheung Yu was furious when he heard what had happened, and immediately rounded up 29 thugs before setting off to find Hsieh.

Cheung - dragging his son along to help identify the boy who beat him - quickly spotted the teenager standing alongside a row of motorbikes outside local college.

He then ordered the mob to attack him, using clubs, bats and their fists.

Hsieh was knocked to the ground, where the gang continued to beat him.

They then dropped one of the nearby motorbikes on top of him.

Video footage of the incident shows the teenager struggling to stand as the mob moves away, before he then collapses and is rushed to hospital.

Medics said Hsieh suffered internal injuries including extensive damage to his kidneys, which doctors fear may never heal.

Doctor Yul Ni said: 'It seems as if he will be on dialysis for the rest of his life.'

Injuries: Hsieh ended up on the floor, and the gang then decided to drop a motorbike on top of him

Permanent: Doctors say the 18-year-old's kidney's sustained serious damage and he will need dialysis
