It's the moment we've all been waiting for (sort of); we finally know who would win a keepy-uppie face off between Lionel Messi and Neymar. Now we can all sleep easy.

With the aim of generating as much energy as they could with a maximum amount of touches in one minute, it was Neymar who wobbled first.

The duo impressed the crowd with their close ball control at the annual Audi-sponsored event where the Barcelona stars were handed the keys to their brand new toys courtesy of the German car manufacturer.

Taking on Lionel Messi in any football-related task would spark fear in the best of men; and Neymar fell at the first hurdle when he dropped the ball after just one kick.

Promptly restarting, Messi and the Brazilian battled it out for the next 60 seconds, generating 1004W and 989W of energy respectively.

Although the result may not have been that shocking, Messi's footwork yet again managed to be typically hair-raising.
