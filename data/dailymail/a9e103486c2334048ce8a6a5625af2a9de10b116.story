Nissan has launched a new version of the London black cab, featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals.

The new taxi, which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital's cabs, is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with London taxis for decades.

Nissan says the new taxi will be available to any city that wants to embrace the black cab, not just London, and although the Japanese car giant has a large manufacturing plant in Sunderland, the vehicle will instead be built in Barcelona.

Green and black: The Nissan taxi promises to be environmentally cleaner than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km. An electric 'zero emission' version is to follow in 2015

The launch has stoked up a taxi-war among rival manufacturers .

Priced at around £30,000, the Nissan cab ditches diesel in favour of a frugal petrol-powered 1.6 litre six-speed automatic taxi which will be launched in December this year.

It promises to be cleaner and greener than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km. An electric-powered 'zero emission' version of the Nissan taxi is to follow in 2015.

Launching the 'new face' of its taxi for London, a Nissan spokesman said: 'It has been re-designed to make it instantly recognisable as one of the capital’s iconic black cabs.'

Nissan's first stab at creating its own version of the famous London Hackney Carriage came in August 2012 when it unveiled a prototype based on its successful multi-purpose NV200 van.

But the taxi version didn’t quite hit the mark.

The new Nissan taxi will be available to any city that wants to take on the black cab. But despite the car manufacturer having a large plant in Sunderland, the groundbreaking vehicle will be built in Barcelona

The new Nissan taxi has been designed using 'feedback' from a number of sources, including Boris Johnson and Transport for London.

Strict guidelines seek to protect not only the safety and efficiency of London taxis, but also the black cab's iconic design.

As a result, the new Nissan features large, round headlights and an over-sized grille to ensure it mirrors the traditional black cab look.

Elsewhere, the taxi has a 25-foot turning circle - the minimum required by Transport for London, who insist all cabs are able to pick-up and drop-off passengers in the narrow road outside the Savoy Hotel.

The Nissan taxi also features a panoramic glass roof designed to appeal to tourists, antibacterial seat covers, and ultra-fast sliding doors which allow passengers to make a swift exit if they are going to be sick.

Finally Nissan have removed cup-holders from their taxi as research suggests passengers are more likely to lose their wallets and phones in them than use them for drinks.

So in response to 'feedback'  from London Mayor Boris Johnson, Transport for London and other key organisations, Nissan's Paddington design team - who also created the best-selling Qashqai and Juke models - redesigned the vehicle 'to better reflect the iconic nature of the traditional black cab'.

This included fitting round headlamps and a re-modelled grille mirroring the traditional black cab 'face', adding LED lighting to improve visibility of the traditional taxi sign, and creating completely new front bumper panels.

To be allowed to ply its trade in the capital, the  new Nissan taxi has to the strict Transport for London regulations governing Hackney Carriages, including the required 25-foot turning circle which allows it to pick-up and drop-off outside the narrow confines of the Savoy Hotel.

A panoramic glass roof helps sight-seers, but Nissan went further.

Nissan's global chief planning officer
 and executive vice president Andy Palmer, noted: 'It included fitting antibacterial seat fabric, no cup-holders because passengers leave their
 mobile phones in them, and sliding doors that aren’t a hazard to 
cyclists.'

Most practically he noted: 'They also wanted doors that can open fast in case the passenger wants to be sick.'

Expecting the worst: One of the key features of the new Nissan taxi is an ultra-fast door release, allowing passengers to exit the vehicle quickly if they are going to be sick

Nissan stress the taxi will be 
available to any other town or city across the UK which wants a new take
 on the traditional black cab.

But
 although Nissan has a big factory at Sunderland, the new taxi will be 
built in Barcelona.

Engineers at European Nissan Technical Centre in
 Cranfield, Bedfordshire have worked on the cab  however, and have been running 
real-world trials on the streets of London.

Nissan design chief Darryl Scriven, said: 'The main challenges were concerned with making sure customers can easily recognise it as a taxi. Being in London, we were able to go out and talk to cabbies about what was important to them as well as look at the vehicle from a customer’s viewpoint.

'The Mayor’s office and taxi drivers were
 very keen that we maintain the character of the Hackney Carriage, 
making it something that people in the city can be proud of.'

Rivals: Mercedes-Benz has entered the capital’s taxi cab-market with its own Vito cabs (left). The London Taxi Company (right) went into administration in 2012 and was bought by Chinese car-maker Geely for £11 million

Nissan already has link to the London taxi market, with its 2.7-litre TD27 diesel engine fitted to the FX4 ‘Fairway’ and TX1 black cabs during the 1980s and 90s.

Nissan dealer Glyn Hopkin has been appointed as the exclusive retailer to sell the Nissan NV200 Taxi for London from a purpose-built showroom at London's Canary Wharf.

Long-standing cab-maker London Taxi Company (LTC), which used to be known as LTI, went into administration in October 2012 and was bought by Chinese car-maker Geely for £11million.

Full-scale production of their black cabs resumed in Coventry in September.

Mercedes-Benz has entered the capital’s taxi cab-market with its own Vito cabs and Metrocab is planning its own electric rival.
