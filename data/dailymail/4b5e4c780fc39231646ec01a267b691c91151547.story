With the amount of mud slinging which has already taken place between the former couple, there was no doubt Christie Brinkley's ex-husband was going to retaliate after she broke down in tears on TV and called him a narcissist.

Peter Cook hit back at his wife of 12 years, branding her emotional interview yesterday as a 'cunning and shameless display in what I can only imagine was an attempt to garner public sympathy by dishonest means'.

During the former supermodel's interview with Matt Lauer yesterday on the Today Show, she broke down in tears as she poured her heart out about the misery she has been through, telling Lauer that she just wanted peace for her family.

She also claimed that every time she achieves any kind of success or joy, Cook does his best to destroy it.

Shortly after her appearance, the 
Hampton's architect released an accusatory statement saying: 'Christie 
was entirely dishonest about the circumstances surrounding the current 
court action which was precipitated by her and . . . is doing further 
damage to our children.

'I am also shocked by the blatant 
lies she told regarding our divorce proceedings of four years ago, 
including denying the indisputable fact that she fought for an open 
courtroom despite the warnings it would harm our children.

'She will stop at nothing to continue the drama in our lives in order to harass me and keep herself relevant in the media.

'She does not want peace, she wants attention.'

He added his ex-wife still wants 
revenge on him for cheating with neighbour's daughter Diana Bianchi, saying: 'Clearly, 
Christie does not believe I was punished enough four years ago for my 
indiscretions in our marriage, but for the sake of our children I wish 
she would find a way to move on.'

In the last month, there has 
been a consistent media storm surrounding the estranged couple - who 
were married for 12 years - which started when Christie told a judge 
that Peter Cook was sending her rude emails and had not been keeping up 
with child maintenance payments.

The architect then went on damage control, appearing on a number of talk shows to slam his ex-wife, branding her a liar and a 'narcissistic egomaniac'.

He recently accused her of 'throwing her family under a bus' and 'running a media circus' to promote her Broadway show.

When asked by Matt Lauer 
yesterday why she has now decided to speak publicly about the ongoing 
battle, she said: 'Since the day he realized I wasn't coming back there 
has been a character assassination.

'I
asked for a confidentiality agreement and got it. I alone have 
maintained that. I had a lot of offers to come on TV and talk about it 
and I didn't want to do it.

'I
have turned the other cheek. There is not one quote from me anywhere. 
This is the first time I've been on a show and I'm really here to talk 
about Chicago.

'But
I have endured weeks of lies and character assassination and a media 
storm. I have never taken part in name calling. The only thing I ever 
said at the end of the second trial was 'Google "divorcing a 
narcissist".

'I'm not alone. I've gotten hundreds of letters from women who are going through this. It's not easy.'

Cook denied claims he owes the 58-year-old child maintenance and said he pays double what is required by courts.

But
she revealed on the Today show that he pays $600 a month for each of 
their children which she calls 'a very minimal amount of money'.

She added: 'It wasn't about the money. I have hesitated to do anything with the court because he actually likes the publicity and he likes going to court.'

Lauer
then asked the former Sports Illustrated model - who has been married 
four times - what all of this is doing to her children and why they 
cannot be civil to each other for their sakes.

The
mother-of-three said: 'Peter has went on several shows, this is my 
first. So maybe ask him why he is doing this to the kids.'

She
also said there should be some type of legislation that protects 
families from spouses who have been diagnosed by the court-appointed 
forensic psychiatrist as a bona fide malignant or extreme narcissist.

When
the interview came to a close, and it was pointed out that little 
mention was made of Chicago, Christie struggled to talk as she 
desperately asked for peace.

'I
asked the judge, "Please make it stop, protect my right to peace. I 
just want peace for my family".

'Every time I have any joy or any 
kind of success in anything, he has to try to destroy it.'

Last week her lawyers responded to the Cook's claims his ex wife was using her family and their divorce to promote her show.

Brinkley's attorney, Tom Campagna, released the 
following statement: 'Peter Cook has repeatedly broken the 
confidentiality agreement that Christie has continued to uphold.

'Peter 
is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist, 
disgraceful, demonstrably false lies, which gives a taste of what 
Christie has had to endure since Peter betrayed his marriage vows.

'Peter
embarrassed himself and hurt his family by having an affair with a 
teenage girl and admitting to an extensive pornography habit.'

This came after Cook told ABC News he
believed she was throwing her family 'under the bus' to drum up 
publicity for her return to Broadway.

'She can use her celebrity to get the 
media to say "He's a bad guy". You know … I'm not trying to sell tickets
to anything. I don't want this press. I'm not interested in it.

'And 
there's got to be a better way for her to do it. Go do a charitable act 
or something, get your name in the paper. But stop throwing your family 
under the bus.'

Christie met Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. He legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack.

She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel.

Christie appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years.

But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008.

Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn.

He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time.

During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet.

Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr 
Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when 
disciplining the children.

The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy.

Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms 
Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, 
California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school at age 18.

She then spent three years as an 
illustrator before being noticed by an American photographer - and then 
proceeded to appear on 200 magazine covers in the 1980s.

Ms Brinkley is most famous for 
appearing on three consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition 
covers from 1979 to 1981, and for her appearances in perfume and shampoo
adverts.
