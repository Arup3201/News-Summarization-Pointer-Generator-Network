A billboard advertising a heavily trafficked pornography site caused controversy in Los Angeles after it was put up above a popular family hot dog and hamburger restaurant.

The sign was painted over last Monday after hanging above  Carney's restaurant for two weeks on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood.

'You walk up my ramp, and the billboard stares straight at you,' said the restaurant's owner John Wolfe told the LA Times.

Need a hand?: Pornhub hung this billboard above Carney's hot dog and hamburger restaurant in West Hollywood which sparked some controversy  

Family restaurant: Carmey's is a hot dog and hamburger destination in West Hollywood that is frequented by both adults and their children, some of whom were curious about the racy billboard 

'If you're going to do something like that, put it in a strip club.... Kids were asking their parents about it,' he added.

The Billboard popped up a day last month in West Hollywood just days after being taken down in Times Square.

Pornhub's vice president Corey Price told the LA Times that he decided to post the billboard in order to push pornography, ‘into the mainstream consciousness and away from what most people conceive as being a taboo subject.'

The advertisement which hung in Times Square was taken down after two days when the Hilton Doubletree's general manager complained.

'All you need is hand,' read the racy billboard insinuating that watching pornography can be a solo activity.

The LA Times reports that after the billboard went up, people stopped in the Carney's parking lot to take selfies with it.

One man tweeted, 'the world is officially coming to an end.'

'Had I not been in a hurry, I would have totally stopped for a photo,' said Filmmaker Joshua Caldwell who spotted the sign while stuck in traffic.

Porn 'used to be this hidden thing no one really talked about.... It certainly made me do a double take.'

City spokeswoman Lisa Bedlanti said that no formal complaints were made about the billboard but even if they were the city has no control over privately owned billboards.

The billboard only hung for two weeks because Pornhub believed it was enough time to get the word out.

No control: Even though no one lodged any formal complaints against the advertisement, the city has no control over privately owned billboards
