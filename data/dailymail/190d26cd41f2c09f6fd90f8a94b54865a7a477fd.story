Diane Sawyer is America's most-liked news personality, with the ABC host beating CNN’s Anderson Cooper and NBC’s Brian Williams in a poll.

But at the other end of the scale, radio host Rush Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly of Fox News and CNN anchor Nancy Grace are the least-favourite.

The findings from a cross-party survey also show British CNN host Piers Morgan is the sixth least-favourite presenter among Americans.

according to a survey

‘Sometimes a news personality is supposed to just provide the news,’ said a spokesman for Harris Interactive, who did the national survey.

‘Other times, controversy or political leanings drive a current affairs personality. People choose their newscaster for certain reasons.’

The survey asked for opinions on 26 top news broadcasters in America, and respondents stated their most- and least-favourites.

One-quarter of Americans prefer Ms Sawyer, 66, the 'World News' anchor from Kentucky, who has been working in broadcasting since 1967.

She is followed on 19 per cent by Mr Cooper, the 44-year-old from New York who presents his CNN show Anderson Cooper 360°.

Mixed feelings: NBC's Brian Williams, left, fared well in the survey, 
whereas Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, right, came in the top five of the 
most-liked and least-liked

On the same percentage is Mr Williams of NBC Nightly News, who began his broadcasting career more than 30 years ago in Kansas.

Behind him on 15 per cent is Mr 
O’Reilly, 62, who presents The O'Reilly Factor. However the Fox anchor is also 
the second least-liked presenter.

This shows how many presenters have a 
big following among some viewers and hatred from others, often split by 
political party affiliation.

Conservative broadcaster Mr Limbaugh, 61, puts out the most listened-to radio talk show in the U.S. - but he is also the most hated presenter.

Nancy Grace, right, came in the bottom three of the Harris Interactive 
survey

Almost half of Americans (46 per cent) say he is the worst, compared to 31 per cent who dislike Mr O’Reilly and 23 per cent against Ms Grace.

The results were broken down by party, showing 28 per cent of Democrats picked Ms Sawyer first, compared to 17 per cent of Republicans.

Mr O'Reilly was the most-liked by Republicans, with 29 per cent, despite coming fourth overall. Radio host Sean Hannity was the GOP's second.

For Mr Limbaugh, 66 per cent of Democrats said he was their least-liked presenter, compared to 24 per cent of Republican respondents.

The poll of 2,016 adult respondents was conducted by New York-based market research firm Harris Interactive in mid-January.
