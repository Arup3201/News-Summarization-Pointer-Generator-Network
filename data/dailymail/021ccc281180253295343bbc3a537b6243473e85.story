The unpredictability of an Australian winter has struck.

As Sydney remained covered in sunshine, Hobart experienced a blanket of snow, Melbourne braced for a wintry front and wild storms lashed out in the country's south causing one person to die after being struck by a falling tree. 

Social media was abuzz early on Thursday as Sydneysiders shared photos of the sun shining on the iconic harbour with temperatures set to reach a maximum of 25.
