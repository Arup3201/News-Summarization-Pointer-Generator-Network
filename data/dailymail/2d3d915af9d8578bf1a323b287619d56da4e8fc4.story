In one of her most sophisticated shoots to date, Daisy Lowe plays the role of undercover outlaw in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired Fall/Winter 2013 campaign for handbag firm Lancaster Paris.

Shot in freezing temperatures in Chicago by Guy Aroch, British It-girl Lowe turns up the heat with American model Donny Lewis in just-released images.

The pair are pictured walking through the windy city's streets in covertly captured pictures featuring mirrors, soft vintage colour filters and lots of designer handbags.

In a retro universe joined with the paralleled style of photographer Guy Aroch, complete synergy is met.

Aroch has photographed the accessories firm's last four campaigns and continues to be the driving force behind their eye-catching images with this season's offering.

Combining luxurious Lancaster Paris products and a magnetic Daisy Lowe, he manages to capture cinematic type shots while telling an emotionally-charged love story and showing off the bag collection.

Combining both collections of men's and women's, the collection evokes a new visual approach to expressing the lifestyle environment for the Lancaster Brand.

Lancaster Paris' Fall/Winter 2013 women's line spells luxury with a twist.

Ranging from savvy to regal, their new Mademoiselle Lana bags emobody rich, bright colors and gold trimmed hardware while the St Honore collection features combined leather fabrications of patent and suede. For the more eccentric fashionistas, the Patty Exotic collection ticks all the boxes.

For men, this season it's all about being classy with an edge. Lancaster Paris offers styles that are practical yet stylish for today's gentlemen.

New lines such as the Dandy or the 48h Soft Vintage are just some of the sacs and satchels that complete their functional and fashionable range.Â
