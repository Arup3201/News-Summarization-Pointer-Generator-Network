The autopsy of a young woman whose body was found in the Colorado River after she disappeared while rafting through the Grand Canyon has revealed that she had been drinking excessively at the time of her death.

The body of Kaitlin Kenney, who turned 21 during the month-long rafting trip that lead to her death, was found in late March after a two-month search following her January 11 disappearance.

Previous reports speculated that she may have taken hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time of her death, since she was said to have brought them on the rafting trip with her, but the autopsy showed that she only had alcohol in her system.

Worst fear confirmed: Officials found the body of Kaitlin Anne Kenney, 21, in the Colorado River, two months after disappearing during a rafting trip with friends

Even still, her apparent decision to 
drink during the trip comes in contrast to her journal entries where she
wrote about the dangers of imbibing while on a self-guided rafting 
trip.

'Drinking out of 
control or to the point of unconsciousness is probably the most 
dangerous thing we can be doing out there,' she wrote in a journal entry
dated four days before she disappeared.

'She might just have wanted to let loose,' her brother Ryan Kenney told the AP, even though he said she was not a big drinker.

Kenney was on the trip with a group of friends and they had boxes of wine and beer among their supplies.

No drugs: Kenney had brought hallucinagenic mushrooms on the trip with her and taken some in the days leading up to her death but the autopsy didn't show any traces in her system on that fateful night

The friends told investigators that they also shared whiskey with a passing group who visited them at their campsite.

In
the days leading up to her disappearance on the night of January 11, 
Kenney had eaten some of the hallucinogenic mushrooms that she brought 
with her, but their effects would have likely worn off by the time she 
walked away from the campfire that fateful night.

Her
friends told the Associated Press that aside from walking away from the
campsite unannounced on the night of the 11th, her unusual behavior 
started much earlier in the day.

Kenney,
who was an accomplished musician, woke up 30 minutes earlier than the 
rest of her group and went on a walk upstream, bringing her mandolin 
with her.

Free spirit: Kenney was an anthropology major at University of Montana and an accomplished musician who played the fiddle and the mandolin

Firm clues: The autopsy report said that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 at the time of her death, which is significantly higher than the legal driving limit of 0.8

Her body was found floating in the river two months later.

She was back by 
breakfast, and the day carried on as normal except that friends reported
that she began slurring her words as the day went on, with her speech 
becoming more and more incoherent.

Another witness said that she was acting out of character.

That
night, the group divided into smaller pairings around the campfire, and
as they were going to bed no one noticed that she hadn't gone into a 
tent.

Gone: Kenny was rafting through the Grand Canyon's waterways when she vanished without a trace

The next morning they realized she was gone.

A two month search ensued, with their biggest lead being the single set of footprints that led them downriver.

The prints- which showed one boot mark and one bare footprint- stopped about a half-mile away from the camp.
