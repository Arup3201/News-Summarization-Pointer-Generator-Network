It’s every person’s dream to buy their dream home but it seems Australians have become more obsessed with improving what they already have.

With property prices booming across the country more and more home-owners are choosing to spend their money making what they've got as impressive as possible.

An ideal home for Australians consists of a swimming pool, walk-in wardrobes, home theatre and integrated sound system, designer kitchen and even a fireplace.

While it seems too good to be true, nearly one in five Australian women say they already live their dream home and one in seven men couldn't agree more, according to design platform Houzz.

Adding Value – To add value to your home, home-owners are increasingly desiring luxury ‘hotel’ like bathrooms and ensuites that accommodate double shower cubicles, twin basins, the use of natural stone tiles and make-up areas. 

Following popular reality TV cooking shows, home-owners are now looking for the latest kitchen gadgets, cooking preparation areas and professional set ups. Whatever your space and budget, a bathroom and kitchen with a designer feel can add value to your property.

Trends – A current trend in Australia is creating an outdoor undercover alfresco area connected to your living space that houses a BBQ, sink, wood fire pizza oven, built in outdoor cupboards and overhead heating that suits the Australian outdoor way of living. 

Even if you create this using a simple marquee, nice potted plants and textured outdoor pillows on seats, this will create the outdoor room effect that people love.

Decorating - The most basic and cost effective way to add value to your home is to re-paint, re-carpet and where possible re-tile areas that look dated. 

Even changing small details like door handles and hinges can completely freshen the look of your home.

Professionals Help – If calling in professionals like architects and interiors designers, be clear on your brief. What is it that you want from the renovation?

The designer must convey to you whether your brief can be fulfilled with your budgetary requirements. There is no use starting the design process if you don’t have enough funds to fulfil your brief, so be honest about your budget.

Small spaces - The best way to make the most of small space properties is to create built in joinery and storage, eliminating clutter and the need to purchase multiple furnishings. 

So for example making a stylish mezzanine / foldaway area for your bed and a pull out desk for office space.
