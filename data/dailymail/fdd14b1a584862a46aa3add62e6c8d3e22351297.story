She was found outdoors in wintry conditions - shivering, whimpering, dehydrated and barely alive.

Brooke had been abandoned in severely stormy weather despite being less than one year old - and was taken to a vet
after being found by a dog walker on marshes in Leigh, Greater 
Manchester.

The dog had been forced to watch her brother
die of cold and hunger during winds of up to 106mph, but survived 
outdoors for two days. At the vet’s, she was placed on a drip and won her battle for life.

Healthy: Since her rescue, Brooke's weight has more than doubled from just 7.05kg when she came into care with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to 14.56kg - a 106 per cent increase

In court: Mother-of-three Cassie George, 22, and her partner Paul Hilton, 30, also left their pet rabbit to die

Seven months after her rescue in 
February, this black and white Staffordshire Bull terrier cross is 
getting healthier and her weight has more than doubled.

Since her rescue, Brooke’s weight has gone from just one stone (7.05kg), when she came into care with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to more than two stone (14.56kg) - a 106 per cent increase.

Today pictures emerged of a starving Brooke taken when she was saved and then looking healthy this month, as her former master and mistress avoided jail for causing unnecessary suffering.

Mother-of-three Cassie George, 22, and her partner Paul Hilton, 30, also left their pet rabbit to die in its hutch before letting a neighbour dump the two starving dogs in the field.

RSPCA inspector Vicky McDonald said today: ‘I collected Brooke and she was one of the thinnest dogs I had ever seen that was still alive. She was so cold and thin and hardly move.

‘I took her to a vet and when weighed she was less than half the weight she should be. It is clear she had not been roaming the streets - she’d been dumped.

‘The fact that she’s survived after 
being in a shocking state when she was discovered and is testament to 
all of the people who have cared for her since then.

‘I’ve
never seen an increase in body weight like that, she’s more than 
doubled her weight, that’s how terrible a condition she was in.’

The
discovery was made after RSPCA officers acting a tip-off went to the 
couple’s home on Keble Grove in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in January 
after a report about a dead rabbit.

Saved: Brooke is seen (left) looking emaciated after she was rescued, and (right) a door is pictured leading out of the home's dining room, which is thought to have been scratched and chewed by dogs

Spotted: In February, the couple's dark brindle Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog named Chubbs was found by a member of the public on a nearby marshes playing field, pictured

The body of 
the rabbit, which had been left to starve to death, was found in its 
filthy hutch. But George told the inspector she had no other animals - 
and it is believed the dogs were kept hidden.

Seven
weeks later in February, the couple’s dark brindle Staffordshire bull 
terrier-type dog named Chubbs was found by a member of the public on the
nearby marshes playing field.

'I collected Brooke and she was one of the thinnest dogs I had ever seen that was still alive. She was so cold and thin and hardly move'

Vicky McDonald, RSPCA inspector

Chubbs was collapsed, emaciated and barely alive, and by the time assistance arrived he had died. Two days later Brooke - then called Bitches - was found on the playing fields in a sheet.

Miss McDonald said: ‘She must have been dumped there because in her condition there was no way she could have walked there.

‘A member of the public walking a dog found her by a fence and a brook. It was just too much of a coincidence for both dogs to be found in a similar state at the same location.

‘I did a public appeal for anyone who recognised the dogs to get in touch and they did. That’s when we realised we were already dealing with the owner about a rabbit.’

Shocking: The filthy hutch and body of the dead rabbit also owned by Cassie George and Paul Hilton

Tests revealed the rabbit, which was 
white and brown, was malnourished and suffering from a chronic ear 
infection and its body was found in its own filth.

'Chubbs was in such a poor state, he died before any help arrived. Brooke was found in identical circumstances, wrapped in a sheet and hidden in some bushes in the same fields'

Tony Stock, prosecuting

Chubbs died as a result of malnutrition.
He was also dumped in a manner that exposed him to the elements. But 
after being signed over to the RSPCA, Brooke has now been rehomed.

George pleaded guilty to nine allegations and Hilton pleaded guilty to four allegations under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 during a hearing at Wigan Magistrates Court.

‘Chubbs was in such a poor state, he died before any help arrived,’ Tony Stock, prosecuting, said. ‘Brooke was found in identical circumstances, wrapped in a sheet and hidden in some bushes in the same fields.

‘That dog was more fortunate and after receiving immediate and emergency care, that dog survived. Brooke survived only by the narrowest margin.’

Atrocious: Pictured are the filthy conditions inside the home of pet owners Cassie George and Paul Hilton

Karen Schofield, defending both George 
and Hilton, said the couple had bought the dogs as pets and added that 
they had ‘started off looking after the dogs and caring for the dogs 
well’.

She said: ‘She (George) wasn’t really bothered about getting pets, but accepted that it might be a good thing for the children to have some pets in the house.’

But whilst pregnant with their third child George became scared of the dogs and they became confined to the back room.

She claimed she thought a neighbour was feeding and walking the dogs and did not realise he had actually dumped them.

Hilton was jailed for 18 weeks - suspended for two years - and given a nine-month supervision order. George was also jailed for 18 weeks - suspended for two years - and got a four-month curfew.

Both were disqualified for life from keeping animals and each had to pay £500 costs. A neighbour pleaded not guilty to four animal welfare allegations and is awaiting trial.
