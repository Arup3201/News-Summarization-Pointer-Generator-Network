The report into the decades of sexual abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall at the BBC is due to be published in May.

Dame Janet Smith's review has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and 'been in contact' with 775 as part of the investigation, which was established in October 2012. 

In a statement released today she said that a timeline for publication with the Corporation is being discussed and this is expected for the second half of May.

More than 100 witnesses have come forward with information about Hall, who was jailed for two and a half years last year, and 375 people have given evidence about Savile. 

The statement published online said: 'The review is discussing a timeline for delivery and arrangements for publication of the report with the BBC.

'Publication is currently expected in the second half of May 2015. As soon as a date for publication is known, a further update will be provided.' 

The latest update on the review's work says it has 'been in contact' with 775 people as part of the investigation.

It said: 'The review has now finished taking evidence and it will not be accepting any new evidence.'

It has been reported that the Dame Janet Smith review is expected to uncover hundreds of victims and reveal a culture of ignorance which 'protected' Savile.

Another report published last month said NHS hospitals had still not fully learned the lessons of the Savile sex abuse scandal and he was given 'endorsement from the very highest level of society'.

The then-prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, had appointed him in an official fundraising role at Stoke Mandeville Hospital where he raped or assaulted at least 63 patients, staff and visitors.

Savile was given open access to the Buckinghamshire hospital while volunteering as a porter from 1969.

While tales of his behaviour were widespread by the early 1970s, senior staff were never told of his 'wicked' crimes -many of them against desperately ill children.

Barrister Kate Lampard, whose review of Savile's offending across NHS institutions made a series of recommendations, said the access he was given offered him the 'opportunity to commit sexual abuses on a grand scale for nearly 50 years'. 

Hall, known for being the face of It's a Knockout, was convicted by  at Preston Crown Court of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16 and earlier pleading guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13.

He was already serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty in 2013 to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. 

Members of the review visited the court during Hall's trial and also visited the Shepherds Bush Empire Theatre, which was owned by the BBC, and Television Centre.
