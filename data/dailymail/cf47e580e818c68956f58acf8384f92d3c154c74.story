A little girl is offering all the money in her piggy bank for the return of her puppy, a five-month-old shih tzu-yorkie mix taken in a burglary.

Marissa Mabanag, 10, has offered the contents of her piggy bank because she 'just wants her doggie back,’ according to her father, Michael Mabanag. 

Her home in San Jose was burglarised on Monday; though the thieves made off with the family’s electronics and other valuables, Marissa is most concerned with getting her beloved puppy back.

Safe return: Marissa Mabanag, 10, centre, has offered the contents of her piggy bank to get back her puppy, Meeko

Stolen: Meeko, a six-month-old shih-tzu-Yorkie mix, was stolen when their house was burglarised on Monday

But Marissa has help from high places. San Jose's police and firefighters' unions, as well as the office of San Jose City Council’s Ash Kalra, have pooled their funds for a $6,000 combined reward.

The Mabanag’s home has been burglarised twice this year already. Mr Mabanag told the San Jose Mercury News that while the family had taken preventative measures following the first burglary, it clearly wasn’t enough.

The father came home Monday to find their garage open and windows of the house smashed in. Several electronic items were missing, as well as the family’s bicycles.

He said the first thing he did was to look for Meeko. But the little pup was nowhere to be found. ‘It was one of the worst days of my life,’ he told the paper, after he realised Meeko was gone.

‘How do you break that to your daughter?’

Big reward: Marissa is offering her piggy bank - plus an additional $6,000 donated by the police and firefighter unions, and a donation from San Jose City Council's Ash Kalra

Namesake: Marissa said she named the puppy after Meeko, the mischievous raccoon from the Disney film Pocahontas

Talking to a group of reporters, Marissa said that she named the dog after the mischievous raccoon from the Disney movie, Pocahontas.

She added that he was a ‘dead ringer’ for Chewbacca from the Star Wars films.

According to ABC affiliate ABC7 News, Mr Mabanag brought home the puppy over the summer after his two daughters made their school’s honour role.

Marissa said that she wants to know that the dog is safe. ‘I just want to know if he is okay or not, if he’s hurt or not, that’s it,’ the 10-year-old student said.

The San Jose police department’s burglary division has seen cuts in recent years. Members of city council blame the recent downshift in law enforcement officials in the influx of burglaries.

Marissa offered a final, desperate plea to the burglars: ‘Can you try to turn him into me?’ she asked. ‘It would mean the world to me if you turn him in.’
