Qantas' record $2.84 billion loss didn't come as a shock for a former flight attendant who worked 12 years for the company.

Once known as the high-flying luxury airline, Mr Beddall says the iconic Australian brand fails to meet its high standards.

Mr Beddall, who spent his career attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant, told Daily Mail Australia why The Flying Kangaroo is spiralling downhill and will continue to do so until the Australian government addresses 'the white elephant in the room'.

The little luxuries are missing

Mr Beddall says Qantas used to pride itself in being a luxury brand with 'the whole package'.

'When I started, we gave our amenity packs which had ear plugs, pajamas, face mist sprays, face masks, expensive moisturisers,' he said.

'The economy class got a little kit too and there was even something for the children.'

Mr Beddall, who maintains contact with his former colleagues who currently work for the airline, says passengers have to specifically ask for such services which puts them in 'an awkward position'.

This is one of the reasons why he believes passengers are no longer getting their value for money.

'Qantas has taken away the little intricacies and although that may not be the stand alone reason why people don't fly with them anymore, people are paying top dollar and they're not satisfied,' he said.

Qantas services and staff are failing to meet the expectations of passengers

Staff morale is at an all-time low

Mr Beddall says his colleagues used to be proud of working for such a landmark Australian brand.

'They would put on their uniform with pride - just as if it was like a military uniform,' he said.

'But now they're embarrassed, fearful for their jobs and disheartened with the union.'

He says there's an overall dark element surrounding staff and it's affecting passengers and their flight experience.

Mr Beddell says management and the board - including Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce (pictured) - should be held responsible

Board and management are terrible â€¦ and refuse to take responsibility

And it all comes down to the board and management.

Mr Beddell says both should be changed immediately with intervention from the government.

'We need to address the white elephant in the room,' he said.

The government needs to intervene to help Qantas financially and also get rid of Alan Joyce [Qantas Chief Executive].'

He also made mention that Qantas has 'forgotten its Australian identity'.

'Passengers felt like they were home flying with Qantas - they even got little jars of Vegemite - but that feeling of comfort isn't there anymore,' he said.

'And that's such a shame because Qantas is such a beautiful iconic Australian brand.'

The running down of economy class

Mr Beddell says passengers in economy class are getting the short end of the stick if they fly with Qantas.

'With the prices that they pay, the normal passengers should be getting the same respect as business class and quite frankly they're not,' he said.

'Me as a consumer - I wouldn't pay top dollar when you're treated just the same, if not better, on other airlines for a cheaper price.'

Qantas no longer has 'the whole package', Mr Beddall said

Poor service and staffing

This also includes the dwindling number of cabin crew on board Qantas flights compared to other carriers.

'There aren't enough staff on board to tend to the passengers and this is another huge factor,' Mr Beddall said.

The staff are also 'disengaged' and often miss the attention to detail.

'We used to be an airline with 100 per cent customer satisfaction,' Mr Beddall said.

'Let's face it, it's not like this anymore for both passengers and staff.'

So where's the airline going now?

'On a rapid downhill slide,' Mr Beddall told Daily Mail Australia.

The retired Qantas flight attendant is now the author of Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley.
