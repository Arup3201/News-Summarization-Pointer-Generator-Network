The overweight should be prescribed Weight Watchers on the  NHS, according to the health watchdog.

GPs will be told to offer the 12-week slimming courses – which typically cost £100 – to patients.

With the UK having the second highest rates of obesity in Europe, the plan is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds.

Weight watchers: GPs will be told to offer the 12-week courses which typically cost £100 to patients

And the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence is advising doctors to consider referring patients who are only ‘overweight’ as well as those who are ‘obese’.

Around a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese and a further 40 per cent are overweight.

But experts say that even if patients lose only a small amount of weight, it could save the NHS money by drastically cutting their risk of developing diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

The NHS currently spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses.

The new guidelines from NICE urge GPs to raise the issue of weight loss in a ‘respectful’ and ‘non-judgmental’ way.

They say that courses such as Weight 
Watchers and Slimming World are a cost-effective way of combating 
soaring obesity rates, and claim that even if patients lose less than a 
stone, it will save money by reducing the number who go on to develop 
serious illnesses.

And although GPs have been told to 
prioritise those with long-term health conditions such as type 2 
diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, the guidelines say 
family doctors should also consider referring patients who are just 
overweight as well as obese.

As
 well as an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related 
illnesses, the NHS also spends £10billion a year dealing with the 
complications of type 2 diabetes.

The NHS already pays for obese patients 
to go to slimming classes and spends an estimated £800,000 a year on 
Weight Watchers alone.

But the new guidance is likely to lead to many more being referred.

Figures
 show patients attending Weight Watchers and similar sessions manage to 
lose only 3 per cent of their body weight. NICE says even this small 
amount will benefit health.

Nutritionist
 Carol Weir, who helped draw up the NICE guidance, said: ‘Losing as 
little as 3 per cent … will have benefits in the long term as long as 
that weight is kept off for several years.’

But
 campaigners questioned how the NHS would be able to pay for all the 
courses and raised doubts over their effectiveness in the long-term.

Obesity
 expert Dr Ian Campbell said: ‘The vast majority of existing weight-loss
 companies don’t offer significant support to achieve behavioural 
change, nor do they have evidence of long-term results.’

And
 Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘The NHS is in such a 
parlous position that it will not be able to fund all the programmes 
needed.’

NICE says that if 
someone with a body mass index of 35 lost 5 per cent of their weight, 
they would typically add two to four years to their life.

This is equivalent to a woman who is 5ft 6in and 13 stone losing just over two stone.

And the benefits are even greater for more obese patients – someone with a BMI of 40 who lost 5 per cent of weight could live between eight and ten years longer.

Not all obese patients will be automatically referred, as it will depend on funds available.
