An armed mob ‘lured’ police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer’s riots, a court heard today.

They fired at least 12 shots at officers from four guns during the night of ‘orchestrated violence’ in Birmingham, a jury was told.

Prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said the Barton Arms pub in the inner city Newtown area was set fire to before furniture from it was used to build a ‘makeshift barricade’ and to smash into other nearby shops and offices.

But in contrast to other incidents during the riots which spread across the country and saw large-scale looting, nothing else was stolen from any of the businesses because the dozens of masked and hooded men responsible for this incident had a ‘different agenda’.

Mr Lockhart said: ‘This was an event in which they carried out a series of acts that they knew a large number of police officers would be deployed to deal with.

‘It was their aim to get a large number of police officers out on the streets where they could then be attacked... They were out on the street armed and intent on violence.’

It had ‘all the hallmarks of a planned event’, with two groups of men – the first numbering 25 or 26, and the second an unspecified number - converging on the pub and ‘a cheer going up’ when they came together.

The jury was shown dramatic CCTV footage of some of them smashing their way into the pub with baseball bats shortly before midnight on August 9 last year before one lit a firebomb in the bar.

Four people were upstairs in the pub at the time, which would have been obvious to the men attacking it as the upstairs lights were on, Mr Lockhart added.

The occupants dialled 999 when they heard the windows breaking and one of them rushed downstairs with a fire extinguisher when the intruders left.

As the police were deployed, some of the group moved away and one could be seen on the CCTV firing a handgun. A police helicopter followed them as they left the area.

On Monday, six men and two youths went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court over the incident.

They are Tyrone Laidley, 20, Nicholas Francis, 26, and Joyah Campbell, 19, and two 17 year olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, all of Birmingham.

They were joined by Wayne Collins, 25, of Luton, Bedfordshire, Renardo Farrell, of Wolverhampton, and Jermaine Lewis, 27, of Oldbury, West Midlands.

In the dock: Six men and two youths have gone on trial at Birmingham Crown Court over the incident

They are each charged with riot, violent disorder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and arson being reckless to whether life would be endangered.

Mr Lockhart said not all the defendants could be shown to have been carrying guns themselves, but it is the prosecution case that all of them ‘encouraged or supported’ those who did.

Similarly, the firebombing of the pub was a ‘joint venture’.

The jury was told they will hear evidence that some of the defendants had met the day before to discuss what they were going to do.

They also heard that there is a series of links between them, ranging from having been to school together to socialising.

The eight defendants each deny all four charges. Some of them say they were incorrectly identified as being present, while others claim they were there but were not involved in the disorder.

The case continues.
