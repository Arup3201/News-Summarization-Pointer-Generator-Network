A thug with 19 convictions has been jailed for smashing a New Year’s Eve reveller on the head with a stolen vodka bottle.

Victim Jonny Smith, 25, was left in a coma for two weeks, needed a titanium plate in his skull and has been left with brain damage. Surgeons removed a section of his skull the size of a man’s hand.

Attacker Alexander Hunter, 21, described by the judge at Ipswich Crown Court as a danger to the public, was jailed for 11 years.

Mr Smith was hit on the head with a vodka bottle after celebrating New Year’s Eve in Colchester town centre with his girlfriend.

He suffered a bleed on the brain.

After the attack, in St Botolph’s Street, Colchester, he could not remember his daughter, confused his relatives and still has constant headaches, although he is improving.

However, he has been warned he could suffer a fatal seizure in the future.

Long-term effects: Mr Smith has been told that he may go back into a coma or even suffer a brain seizure

Doting: Mr Smith had trouble remembering his daughter after he woke up from a coma

Mr Smith, a landscape gardener, said: 'The first thing I remember was waking up in hospital two weeks after I had been out with my then girlfriend.

'I did not know my daughter. My family had to keep coming in every day and say: ‘This is your daughter.’

'Things are starting to come back but I still have difficulty remembering.

'It is quite hard sometimes and I still get bad days.'

His daughter is now 14 months old and Mr Smith said the priority is getting better for her.

He said: 'I can’t drink now and don’t go out in town.

'I don’t really see my friends and I can’t do much.

'I am supposed to stop taking medication now and they say there is a low risk I could go back into a coma or die.'

It was revealed Hunter assaulted two other men on the night he attacked Mr Smith.

The court heard he already had 19 convictions for 27 offences before he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on Mr Smith.

Charges were not brought on the other two assaults, which happened minutes before he attacked Mr Smith.

Crime scene: Forensic experts scour St Botolph's Street for clues following the attack earlier this year

The court heard Hunter had stolen a bottle of vodka from the Silk Road bar in St Botolph’s Street in the early hours of January 1 this year.

Sarah Porter, prosecuting, told the court, he went outside, put the bottle down and punched a man to the floor.

CCTV footage showed him kicking another victim to the floor.

He then picked up the bottle and hit Mr Smith on the head.

When police arrested Hunter they had to call for a caged transport van due to his threatening behaviour.

Jonathan Ray, mitigating, told the court Hunter 'does have another side'.

He read parts of testimonies commenting on the good character of a man who first appeared in court aged 12.

He also read an apology from Hunter saying he is 'truly remorseful' and that his thoughts have been with Mr Smith and his family since his arrest.

Judge John Devaux said: 'This was an unprovoked attack. It resulted in devastating injuries.

'You were under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and long-term steroids.'

The judge took into account his remorse, eventual guilty plea and the fact it was a single hit but said the use of a weapon, the fact he was on bail at the time and the severity of the injuries aggravated the offence.

He said: 'I am sentencing you to 11 years. You are a danger to the public.'

After the hearing the fathers of the victim and attacker shook hands.

Mr Smith said: 'I feel sorry for his family. It was nothing to do with them.

'I shook his dad’s hand. It was hard to do at first but after seeing them in court I got used to seeing them and it is not their fault.'

Other members of Mr Smith’s family embraced members of Hunter’s family after the hearing.

Mr Smith’s uncle, speaking on behalf of the family, said: 'We feel sympathy for Hunter’s family.

'Their lives changed that day too. I hope he leaves behind his life of drink and drugs in jail.

'The sentence was about right and it sends out a message and we hope lessons are learnt.'
