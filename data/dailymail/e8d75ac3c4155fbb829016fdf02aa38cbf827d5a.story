Some children are simply too naughty to fit into everyday school life, the Government’s behaviour tsar suggested today.

There is a group of youngsters who behave in very difficult and violent ways and who need much more help and support, according to Charlie Taylor.

He indicated that there may be have been a rise in these types of pupils, many of whom display very bad behaviour from an early age.

Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee this morning, Mr Taylor - former headteacher of The Willows, a special school in west London for children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties - said that while behaviour in general is improving, there remains a groups of children that persistently behave poorly.

He was asked by Neil Carmichael, Conservative MP for Stroud, why it was that increasing numbers of pupils are suspended from school for abuse or assault and, at the same time, Ofsted rates almost four-fifths of schools as good for behaviour.

Mr Taylor replied that the numbers of schools rated as good has fallen from around 87 per cent as the bar has been raised on standards of behaviour.

He told the committee: 'Though I would say generally, the trajectory of behaviour within schools is improving'

It is now rarer in schools to have 'no-go areas where teachers fear to tread at lunchtimes and break times', Mr Taylor said.

'So things have improved.

'But
 I do think there’s a group of children who show very extreme behaviour,
 very difficult, challenging, violent behaviour, often quite young 
children, and I would say possibly there has been an increase in those 
sorts of children.

'You can 
still be a school who is good on behaviour and still have pupils like 
that within your school because you’re doing a good job with them.

'But
 nevertheless there are certainly a group of children who need extra 
interventions, who need more help, who need more support and for whom 
the basic standards of just a really well-run school aren’t enough.'

He added: 'The trajectory is in the right direction, but there’s a huge amount to carry on doing.'

Mr Taylor has just been appointed the first chief executive of the Teaching Agency, which will oversee teacher training.

Mr Taylor said that he had concerns that some training courses are not teaching would-be teachers enough about behaviour and how to deal with it.

'Sometimes behaviour gets pigeon-holed
 as a one off lecture at the beginning of the year,' he said, with a 
lecturer handing out tips on how to deal with misbehaving pupils.

Mr
 Taylor has previously called for disruptive children to be identified 
before they start school to stop them going 'off the rails' later on.

Publishing
 his report into alternative provision earlier this year, Mr Taylor said
 that intervening to help naughty children when they are as young as two
 or three is better than 'waiting until they are throwing tables 
around'.

Teaching unions 
have previously raised concerns about misbehaving pupils, with a survey 
by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) suggesting that poor 
parenting could be fuelling bad behaviour in schools.

It revealed that behaviour has worsened in the last five years, with pupils kicking, punching, pushing and shoving school staff.

ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said there is a minority of children who have a 'total disregard of school rules'.

These youngsters are just as likely to be 'over-indulged' middle-class children as those from poorer homes, she said.

Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has also warned that schools are often forced to act as 'surrogate parents' in a sometimes self-obsessed culture that fails to instil good values in children.
