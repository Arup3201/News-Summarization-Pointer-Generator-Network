Every little girl wants to look like her mummy.

But fashion designer Victoria Beckham doesn't want daughter Harper growing up too quickly.

A mother for the fourth time with husband David, the 39-year-old fashionista is so wary about 22-month-old Harper picking up on her actions that she avoids putting on beauty products around the toddler to ensure she doesn't feel left out.

She said: 'I can't put on make-up when Harper's around, because she would join me immediately. She is a tomboy towards her brothers.'

Victoria admits she is aware of the pressure her children - also including three sons Cruz, eight, Romeo, 10, and Brookyln, 14 - are under while having famous parents, but makes sure they know they can do good with their celebrity status and doesn't spoil them.

'[Cruz asked] 'Why is it good to be famous, mum?' My answer was, 'When you're famous you have a certain power to do good things,' she told Icon.

'That is how we started talking about charity. Cruz was really sweet and said, "When people listen to what I say, I could spread some good messages".

'The kids are under a lot of pressure to perform. I don't want to pressure them. They should be keen and reach as much as possible. But the most important thing is they are happy.

'They lead a very privileged life but they don't get everything they ask for. We always tell them how lucky they are.'

Romeo has begun to make a name for himself in the fashion world like his mother, modelling for label Burberry, and while he enjoined the experience, Victoria has no plans to force him back.

She said: 'I asked if he wanted to do [modelling] and he said, 'Sure, sounds fun'. And he really had a lot of fun. Will he do it again? I don't know. He's more interested in school and sports right now.'
