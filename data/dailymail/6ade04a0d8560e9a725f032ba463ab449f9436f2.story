Music, it seems, really is the food of love… at least for David Cameron and wife Samantha.

The Prime Minister has revealed the song which soundtracked the couple’s early courtship, and how an eclectic love of music has sustained 18 years of marriage.

Mr Cameron named Perfect Circle, an album track with obscure lyrics by American alternative rock group R.E.M., as the song which they listened to as they fell in love.

Favourite: Perfect Circle, an obscure album track by US band R.E.M. provided the soundtrack to David and Samantha Cameron's early courtship

The Prime Minister, pictured with wife Samantha at the Conservative Party Black & White Ball last night, lifted the lid on the couple's early musical tastes

The Tory leader does not have a good track record with making his musical choices public.

In 2010 The Smiths’ Jonny Marr banned him from listening to their music, after he repeatedly named them as one of his favourite bands.

And Radiohead frontman Tom Yorke vowed to ‘sue the living s***’ of the Conservative if he used one of the band’s songs in an election campaign.

But so far at least there has been no warning from R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe about the song he listened to while wooing his future wife.

Put your hair back, we get to leaveEleven gallows on your sleeveShallow figure, winner's paidEleven shadows way out of place

Standing too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the room

Pull your dress on and stay real closeWho might leave you where I left offA perfect circle of acquaintances and friendsDrink another, coin a phrase

Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the roomHeaven assumed, shoulders high in the roomHeaven assumed, shoulders high in the room

Try to win and suit your needsSpeak out sometimes but try to win

Standing too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the roomStanding too soon, shoulders high in the room

Asked during an interview on BBC Manchester radio to name the song that meant most to the couple when they were falling in love, Mr Cameron named Perfect Circle from R.E.M’s 1983 debut album Murmur.

He told presenter Mike Sweeney: ‘We 
had lots of songs. There was one by R.E.M, I think, which was Perfect 
Circle, which we liked a lot.

‘In
 June this year, we’ll have been married 18 years. I remember it all as 
clear as day, and she’s got some good musical tastes, actually.’

Mr Cameron picked the track when he 
appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs in 2006, saying then that 
it ‘reminds me of driving down to Bristol to Sam’s student flat and 
falling in love’.

While
 the PM has happy memories of listening to the same song over and over 
again, his repetitive music choices have not always curried favour with 
Mrs Cameron.

His favourite 
album of 2013 was Mumford & Sons’ 'Babel'.  But he added: ‘It's 
driving Samantha mad. You know what it’s like when you overplay 
something and it’s even beginning to annoy you, and it’s annoyed 
everyone else in the family.’

Last month he revealed how he and Mrs 
Cameron recently ‘sneaked’ into a concert by obscure Swedish folk duo, 
First Aid Kit. He added: ‘I’ve got into a bit of a countryish thing.’

He has also previously boasted of being a fan of The Killers, Emiliana Torrini and Florence and the Machine. 

Mr Cameron was 'banned' from listening to The Smiths by Johnny Marr, so instead has taken to 'sneaking' into a concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire to see Scandinavian sisters Johanna and Klara Soderberg as First Aid Kit

Last week he named Brit Award-nominee Tom Odell as his latest favourite artist.

The PM said: 'I don’t know who is going to win the Brit awards. I think Tom Odell has got a lovely voice.

'I have been married to Samantha for 18 years this year, she is an amazing woman, and I think his song grow old with me for old romantics like me is a good one.'
