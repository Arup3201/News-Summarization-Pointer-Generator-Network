Bishop, who is accused of passing classified military information to a Chinese lover 32 years his junior

U.S. officials say a 27-year-old university student from China started a relationship with a civilian defense contractor more than twice her age and then found out classified information on U.S. nuclear weaponry, missile defenses and war plans.

But is she a spy?

It is clear the Justice Department believes the woman's boyfriend broke the law, but the criminal complaint that outlines the charges against him never formally accuses her of any crime.

It just paints a picture of a young woman who seems to be involved in espionage.

A Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing says the government knows the woman's location and is continuing to investigate her role.

Her identity and whereabouts haven't been released, and U.S. authorities also haven't said publicly whether they believe she is working for the Chinese government.

She lives in the United States as a student on a J-1 visa, according to an affidavit the FBI filed this week by the FBI in U.S. District Court in Honolulu.

Her boyfriend, Benjamin Bishop, a 59-year-old civilian defense contractor who works at Pacific Command, met the woman at a Hawaii conference on military defense issues.

The counterintelligence agent 
investigating Bishop said the woman may have been at the conference 
specifically to meet people like Bishop, who work with and have access 
to certain classified information, the affidavit said.

They began an intimate, romantic 
relationship in June 2011, according to the affidavit. At the time, 
Bishop was working at a Pacific Command office that develops plans to 
deter potential U.S. adversaries, according to his LinkedIn profile 
online.

Bishop is scheduled to appear in 
federal court Friday for a hearing on whether he should stay in 
detention while prosecutors pursue their case.

Birney Bervar, Bishop's attorney, 
said he planned to seek bail but wasn't optimistic he would be 
successful. Bervar declined to discuss details of the case, saying he 
had not yet spoken in depth to his client.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 1.

The affidavit says the woman told 
Bishop repeatedly she didn't want him to tell her anything classified 
but continued to question Bishop about his work.

Bishop, on the other hand, told her he wouldn't give her any classified information but did so anyway, the document said.

Bishop, a lieutenant colonel in the 
U.S. Army Reserve, is accused of telling her secrets about U.S. nuclear 
weapons, missile defenses, war plans, early warning radar systems and 
other issues.

Last month, the woman asked Bishop 
what western countries knew about a Chinese naval asset. This fell 
outside the scope of Bishop's work but he conducted open source record 
research for her and collected and reviewed classified information on 
the topic, the affidavit said.

Bishop's security clearance required 
him to disclose his contacts with foreign nationals, but the affidavit 
says he failed to let officials know about his relationship with the 
woman.

The FBI declined further comment on Tuesday. A Justice Department spokesman in Honolulu did not return a call seeking comment.

Bishop was married until last year, 
according to state documents in Utah. His ex-wife declined comment when 
approached by The Associated Press on Tuesday at her home in Odgen, 
Utah.

Her neighbor, Sandra Doyle, said it 
was clear Bishop was having an affair with a Chinese woman prior to the 
divorce. Doyle, who said she is friends with the ex-wife, said the 
girlfriend was a university student in the District of Columbia, though 
she didn't know which school.

Doyle said neighbors knew Bishop worked for the government in Hawaii but were unclear on his exact job.

Larry Wortzel, a member of the 
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said China has used 
sexual entrapment as a means to gather intelligence before and the 
allegations aren't surprising.

As an Army reserve officer and 
defense contractor, Bishop would have received security briefings on 
this and understood 'how sex may be used for intelligence targeting,' 
Wortzel said.

Whether U.S. national security was 
damaged by any of the alleged disclosures would depend on how detailed 
the information was and whether the woman knew any of it was classified,
 said Carl Baker, director of programs at Pacific Forum Center for 
Strategic and International Studies.

Information on weapons could be 
harmful because it could tell a potential enemy what U.S. weapons system
 can do as well as what capabilities the adversary would need to develop
 to counter U.S. capabilities, he said.

Bishop's position wouldn't have given him access to specifics about weapons technology, though, Baker said.

Leaked details on military plans might also be detrimental.

'That's an important part, because if
 you divulge enough information about the planning process, you end up 
giving information that reveals a strategy and how you could counter 
that strategy,' Baker said.

The key issues for any trial will be Bishop's intent and the sophistication of the information he passed on, Baker said.

Bishop is charged with one count of 
communicating national defense information to a person not entitled to 
receive it and one count of unlawfully retaining national defense 
documents and plans.
