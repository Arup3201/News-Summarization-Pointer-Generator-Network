A 14-year-old Louisiana boy is being hailed as a hero for stopping an out-of-control school bus filled with high school students after a classmate knocked the driver unconscious.

The unnamed 15-year-old suspect has been charged with assault for attacking the 26-year-old driver in Baton Rouge Thursday as she was dropping off about a half-dozen students from Christa McAuliffe Superintendent's Academy - an alternative school for teens with disciplinary problems.

Police and school officials say the female driver had stopped the bus at around 3pm in the 5100 block of Linden Street to exchange words with the disruptive student.

Sneak attack: A 26-year-old woman was driving a school bus filled with a half-dozen students from an alternative school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when one of them came up behind her and punched her in the head

Young hero: Tay'veon Slaughter, 14, stepped on the breaks to stop the bus from crashing after the driver was knocked unconscious 

According to the driver, when she turned away to face the road, the 15-year-old walked up behind her and punched the woman several times in the head until she passed out.

As the 26-year-old victim lost consciousness, her hands and feet slipped from the wheel and the brakes, and the bus started moving again.

That is when Tay'veon Slaughter, 14, jumped into action. The quick-thinking eighth-grader slammed his foot on the breaks to stop the bus from crashing and called 911.

‘I knew I had to stop the bus because, you know, she's not responding,’ he told the station WAFB, referring to the driver. ‘The bus was speeding up. So I knew if we get into a wreck, all of us would have been hurt.’

The suspected perpetrator of the attack fled the bus before police responded to the scene.

Later that day, the teenager's mother turned him in to police. The 15-year-old was arrested on charges of battery of a bus operator, aggravated obstruction of a roadway and second-degree battery.

School officials say the 15-year-old has been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing and could face expulsion.

The students about the board were from Christa McAuliffe Center - a school for teens with disciplinary problems 

Unaware: When the driver of the bus woke up, she did know she had been attacked and that her face was swollen 

The injured driver was taken to a hospital to be treated for her injures. She has since been released to continue her recovery at home.

Slaughter said that before the attack on the driver, the 15-year-old was throwing things out the widow and spitting at passing cars. The boy reportedly became upset when the driver asked him to stop and sit down.

When the 26-year-old woman regained consciousness, Slaughter said she did not know she had been punched.

'She didn't know that her face was swollen,' the boy recalled to the New Orleans Advocate.

Averil Sanders, principal of Christa McAuliffe Superintendent's Academy, said he was proud of Tay’veon for stepping up to the plate in an emergency situation. 

The humble 14-year-old, however, insisted that he was no hero.

'I had to do what I had to do,' Slaughter said.
