Roy Keane's public feud with Sir Alex Ferguson shows no sign of abating after he claimed Brian Clough was the best manager he played under, not the 38-trophy winning former Man Utd boss.

The former Manchester United skipper wasn't surprised by finer details of his time at Old Trafford featuring heavily in Ferguson's recent autobiography and is on the offensive during an ITV documentary with Patrick Vieira.

Asked who he felt was the best boss during a 17-year career Keane said blankly: 'Brian Clough, without a doubt.'

When pushed on why not Ferguson - the most decorated manager in English football - Keane said: 'You asked me the question. I answered you.'

The way in which the Ireland assistant left the champions in 2005 still stings, but it is the public perception of him that Ferguson has driven since then that has irked Keane.

'I never thought for a second that I was more important than the manager. Absolute nonsense,' he said.

'There were no surprises (in the book). He accused me of managing United behind his back, but I managed the dressing room.'

And on the pair's relationship Keane said: 'Non existent. Nothing surprises me these days with that man.

'Control and power, that's how he works. He is still striving for it now even though he isn't the manager. There is a massive ego involved.'

An interview with MUTV where he criticised younger players at United signalled the end before being released in 2005, but Keane insists that incident was blown out of proportion by the club.

Ferguson described it as a disgrace but Keane said: 'He was wrong. I said a few comments. Some on Darren Fletcher's tackling but it was almost tongue-in-cheek. They were the players I cared about.

'The manager said to me that we had come to the end. I had lost respect for him.

'I knew that was business. I drove back home. I was upset. I shed a few tears in my car outside the training ground for about two minutes.

'I could've played for United for another couple of years.'
