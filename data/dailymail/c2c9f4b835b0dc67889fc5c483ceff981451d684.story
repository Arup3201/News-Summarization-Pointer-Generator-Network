Members of the Saudi royal family 'knowingly and directly' aided al Qaeda in the run up to the attacks on September 11, lawyers for families of victims of the attack claim in a lawsuit.

A brief filed Tuesday refers to sworn statements by Zacarias Moussaoui, often called the 20th hijacker, claiming he met members of the royal family and tracked financial contributions to the extremist group.

CNN reports that Moussaoui says bin Laden made him responsible for tracking donations to al Qaeda on a database in the late 1990s.

Claim: Sworn statements from Zacarias Moussaoui, often referred to as the 20th hijacker, stated members of the Saudi royal family contributed financially to al Qaeda's attack

Among those he claims to have recorded on the Toshiba computer he used were several members of the Saudi royal family, including former ambassador to the United States Prince Turki al Faisal.

Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington released a statement Wednesday calling Moussaoui's claims as those of a 'deranged criminal' and having no evidence to support them.

'The September 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the Saudi government or Saudi officials,' the statement also said.

While there has been some suspicion that the Saudis played a role in the attacks, the report from the 9/11 Commission in 2004 found no evidence of government involvement.

The court brief was filed against a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought forward by families of the victims of the September 11 attacks against Saudi Arabia for its alleged role.

The statements from Moussaoui, a French national who was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for a terrorism conspiracy charge, described him participating in the planning stages of the attacks.

Accused: Moussaoui claimed he met with Prince Turki al Faisal, who introduced him to other members of the royal family

'Deranged' allegations: The Saudi embassy vigorously denied the allegations that royal family members, such as Prince Bandar bin Sultan, were involved

'Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to - to the jihad,' claimed Moussaoui, who was reportedly chosen due to his education and English speaking ability.

He also said that he met on multiple occasions with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia, passing letters to and from bin Laden.

Moussaoui claimed he was taken on private jets and limousines, stayed in hotels and palaces and received expenses for travel from the Saudi embassy in Islamabad.

In addition to claiming he tracked donations from Prince Turki al Faisal, Moussaoui says the prince introduced him to other members of the family, including former ambassador  Prince Bandar bin Sultan.

The brief filed in court also included statements from former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman and former senators Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey of the 9/11 Commission that more scrutiny of Saudi ties was needed.

'I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,' Graham wrote.

Yet Moussaoui is far from a reliable witness, giving erratic and conflicting statements during and after his trial.

Even bin Laden contradicted Moussaoui's claims that he was going to participate in the attacks, releasing audio after Moussaoui's conviction that denied the French national had a role.

'I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers,' bin Laden says in the recording, 'and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.'
