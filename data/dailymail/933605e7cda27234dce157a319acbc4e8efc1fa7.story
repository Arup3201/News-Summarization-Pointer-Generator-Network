A grandmother who was sunbaking topless in her own backyard in a g-string has been left feeling humiliated after  finding herself part of a real estate advertisement for her neighbour's property.

Mandy Lingard, 50, was featured on a for sale billboard outside a Mt Martha home, south-east of Melbourne, after a real estate agent's drone snapped the photos several weeks ago.

The mother of three, who was photographed lying face down, says she heard the drone buzzing as it took aerial shots of her neighbour's million dollar property, the Herald Sun reports.

'A couple of weeks later I walked out my door and thought oh my god that's what it was doing; taking photos,' Ms Lingard said. 

'You could see it's our backyard and quite clearly it was me.

'It's in the real estate magazine, it's on the internet and on the board and I'm really embarrassed.

'My son has noticed it and he’s embarrassed that his mum is there.'

Eview real estate took the billboard down from the property at 552 Esplande, Mt Martha, on Monday

He defended the use of drones for real estate purposes, despite Ms Lingard saying they had a responsibility to let home owners know in case they were effected.

'It's something that Google does and people use that everyday,' Mr Walsh said.

'Most bayside listings benefit from elevated shots to capture the setting.'

It comes after a woman in Mosman, north of Sydney, called police when she spotted a drone flying outside her top-floor apartment in July. 

She was told it was a real estate agent's drone who was 'scoping for properties' and it wasn't illegal because the agent had the required paper work.  

'I got a shock. At first i thought it was a plane in the distance. I could see flashing lights and realised it was a drone. What are they looking at? What are they scoping for. It's crazy,' the woman, who didn't want to be named, told the Mosman Daily.  

The practice of real estate agents flying drones to take advertising photos of properties is legal as long as the operator has approval.

Rules for flying drones is covered under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) legislation and commercial operators must meet certain licensing requirements in order to use them.

There are more than 100 approved operators currently in Australia.
