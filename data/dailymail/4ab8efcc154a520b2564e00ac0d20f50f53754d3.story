Andrew Mitchell was clinging to his job last night as Downing Street struggled to contain open revolt over his future.

The Chief Whip was effectively put on probation as he was ordered to try to ‘rebuild relations’ with MPs furious at the controversy caused by his row with Downing Street police.

The abrasive Cabinet minister caused further consternation by appearing to change his story – insisting he did not swear at officers who told him he should use a side gate rather than have the main entrance specially opened for him and his bicycle.

Under-fire Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell shouted across the Commons chamber that he did not swear at police, but the row refuses to go away

Mr Mitchell’s deputy John Randall had 
to be talked out of quitting last night, and sources said at least one 
other whip – whose job is to maintain party discipline –was considering 
resigning rather than work under him.

Previously, Mr Mitchell’s allies had 
not disputed that he swore during the altercation, though they firmly 
reject police claims that he called officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’.

The 
Chief Whip had been understood to be claiming that he told an officer: 
‘You guys are supposed to ****ing help us.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband used Prime 
Minister’s Questions to claim Mr Mitchell is ‘toast’ and accuse David 
Cameron of ‘total double standards’ for supporting police in arresting 
yobs who swear at officers but refusing to sack his own minister.

But sitting on the government frontbench, the Chief Whip was seen mouthing the words: ‘I didn’t swear.’

Labour party leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of 'total double standards' for not sacking Mr Mitchell

Tory MP Michael Fabricant, a whip 
until last month’s reshuffle, said: ‘Several MPs have confirmed to me 
that Andrew Mitchell did indeed say “I didn’t swear”.

‘This puts a whole new light on the 
issue. Labour were never going to let the story go away, but now he has 
managed to re-ignite it himself.’

At a meeting of the backbench 1922 
committee last night, five MPs – Anne Main, James Duddridge, Andrew 
Percy, Sarah Wollaston and Philip Davies – openly questioned Mr 
Mitchell’s position.

Another three said they felt he should
have resigned earlier on and they were only backing him because it 
would be even messier to throw him overboard now.

Mr Percy complained the row had become
so widely discussed that he had had to listen to sermons in church on 
Mr Mitchell’s behaviour.

However, more than ten MPs, including Bernard 
Jenkin, chairman of the public administration committee, spoke in his 
favour. Sources said the mood had largely been against giving the Police
Federation – which has been waging a campaign to force Mr Mitchell out 
of his job – a scalp.

Some MPs said they felt sorry for Mr 
Mitchell because he appeared to have lost weight and now cuts a ‘pitiful
figure’.One senior source said the Chief Whip would now have to work 
hard to build credibility with MPs.

In a less than resounding endorsement 
of Mr Mitchell’s position, a senior figure in the party admitted that 
his job was safe only because ‘no new facts’ have emerged in the last 
month and that MPs judged it would have been ‘a messy ending’ to see him
quit now.

In the Commons, Mr Miliband pointed to
Mr Mitchell and insisted he should have been arrested.

‘While it is a 
night in the cell for the yobs, it is a night at the Carlton Club for 
the Chief Whip. Isn’t that the clearest case there could be of total 
double standards?’ he said. ‘His position is untenable. In other words, 
he is toast.’

Mr Cameron replied: ‘What the Chief 
Whip did and said were wrong. I am absolutely clear about that. That is 
why it was important that the Chief Whip apologised and that apology was
accepted.’

Last night Mr Mitchell’s denial that he swore at the police 
was challenged by officers who met with him to discuss the incident.

Stuart Hinton, of the Warwickshire 
Police Federation, tweeted: ‘Having been in the meeting with Mitchell on
Friday and having asked questions, I am now confused – he told us he 
DID swear!’

Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said: 
‘The Police Federation are trying to remind us they are a powerful trade
union. Most people have at some time lost their temper, said something 
they should not, and had to apologise fairly abjectly afterward when 
they felt ashamed of themselves.’
