A war veteran aged 99 lay helplessly in pain on the floor of his sheltered accommodation for two and a half days after a free intercom service that could have alerted staff was cut to save just 42 pence a day.

Former Desert Rat Harold Lee feared he would die alone after he fell face down and was unable to get up or call for help.

A pendant alarm the great-grandfather was carrying landed out of reach when  he collapsed.

Neglected: Harold Lee, pictured left this week and right while serving in the Desert Rats, was left lying on the floor of his home for two days after his intercom was cut off

On duty: The Second World War veteran, pictured in 1942, has been 'let down', according to his son

And his intercom – through which he 
had been getting a call every morning from a manager to check he was OK –
had been disconnected weeks earlier after he refused to pay a new 42p 
daily charge imposed in council funding cuts.

The widower, who lost his wife Mabel 
two years ago, was saved only when his grandson Jaa, 24, came to visit 
him and found him on the floor.

Mr Lee’s son Jules, 63, said the 
family felt ‘extremely let down and disappointed’ at the way the Second 
World War hero has been treated.

‘It could have been fatal had he not 
been found,’ he said. ‘This is a man who made this country what it is by
going to war so you would think he’d be worth 42p a day.’

Mr Lee, who 
has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren, maintained yesterday
that he would not pay the new charge because it had been ‘thrust upon 
him’ and had not been part of his agreement when he moved in.

Exotic: Mr Lee served in the Middle East with the Desert Rats - but has now been left infirm

The former signalman, who served twice
in the Allied campaign against Rommel in North Africa and came under 
enemy fire in Libya, collapsed in May while reaching for a remote 
control in his room at a sheltered housing complex in Derby run by 
independent provider Derwent Living.

‘I could only get up on one arm,’ he 
said. ‘The pendant which I’d had in my hand went flying across the floor
and I didn’t know where it was. I just lay there. I went to sleep 
eventually, woke up the next morning, and then did the same again.’

After he was found he was taken to 
hospital where he spent three and a half weeks recovering from bad 
bruising from his abdomen to his knees.

Mr Lee’s son Jules said the 
family was considering legal action. He added: ‘At the age of 99 how can
you expect someone to always remember to wear a pendant?

‘As far as I’m concerned, the intercom
is the only way they could guarantee his safety because it’s a 
guaranteed check once a day.’

Cuts: Mr Lee now has to pay 42p per day for an intercom service at his home in Derby, pictured

Mr Lee claims he was contacted by 
Derwent Living about the 42p charge just a couple of months before the 
free intercom was taken away.

Derwent Living insisted it had 
organised a 12-month campaign to give residents, carers and next of kin 
notice, and blamed the change on cuts in the amount of cash it is given 
by Derby City Council.

The free ‘daily welfare call’ had been covered by
the council, but ended after the authority’s housing-related support 
budget was cut from £6,472,000 in 2012-13 to £3,739,000 in this 
financial year.

Gemma Trowbridge, from Derwent Living,
said an alternative was made available at a ‘small fee’ but some 
residents had chosen not to take up the service.

She added: ‘We were disappointed by 
the council’s decision to cut the funding. Our thoughts are with Harold 
and his family following  his distress.’ She said a programme of daily 
support for Mr Lee was now in place.

Betrayal: 'This is a man who made this country what it is by going to war so you would think he'd be worth 42p,' said his son

Upset: Mr Lee was rescued from his ordeal only when his grandson went to visit him

Councillor Mark Tittley, cabinet member for adults and health, expressed his ‘deep regret’ for what happened.

He added: ‘The council recognises that
housing-related support services are valuable to help vulnerable people
live independently.

'However, they are not mandatory and as such they 
are not the types of services that councils have to make available by 
law.’
