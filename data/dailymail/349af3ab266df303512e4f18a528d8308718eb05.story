A woman who tipped flour over her black neighbour and told her: 'You are now white British' in an unprovoked racist attack has been jailed.

South African-born Pamela Bower was sitting in her garden having a cup of tea in Gillingham, Kent when Kellie Wells climbed over her six foot garden fence and began abusing her.

Maidstone Crown Court heard how 42-year-old Wells told Miss Bower, who has lived in the UK for 15 years: 'Go back to your country you gorilla creature.'

Miss Bower, 38, said: 'She had an ice cream container. She threw it at me. It hit me on the head. I was covered in flour. I said: 'What have I done to you?'

'Her friend was laughing and pointing at me. Kellie said: 'You are now white British.' I went in the house. I was upset.'

Miss Bower said she called the police but had a shower and washed off the flour after being told officers would not arrive for two hours.

They did not turn up until the next day and Wells was charged with racially-aggravated harassment.

The court heard the mother-of-three had also threatened to burn down Miss Bower's home.

She admitted racially-aggravated harassment but denied throwing flour when she appeared in court yesterday.

The judge sentenced her to 33 weeks in jail and made her the subject of a restraining order for 10 years.

Recorder Gordon Reed told her: 'Your behaviour was humiliating and highly offensive. In my judgement this is at the high end of the scale.

Mother-of-three Wells, 42, who has 19 convictions, threw white flour over Miss Bower and told her: 'You are now white British'. Wells was jailed for 33 weeks at Maidstone Crown Court and handed a restraining order

'Your conduct has a number of aggravating features. She was in her own home - the one place she was entitled above all else to feel comfortable and secure.

'It led to the point where she was scared to go home and she was feeling constantly stressed. She didn't feel she could go into her own garden.

'There is little evidence you show remorse. Overall, this was appalling conduct. One cannot overstate the seriousness of it. It simply cannot be tolerated.'

Andrew Forsyth, prosecuting, said Wells, had 19 convictions for 27 offences, mainly for shoplifting.

She failed to comply with community orders on a number of occasions and was in breach of a suspended sentence for battery involving an attack on a taxi driver.

But, despite the breach, Recorder Reed decided to make the 28-day sentence concurrent instead of consecutive.
