Two policeman accused of lying to MPs over the ‘Plebgate’ affair involving former Tory Minister Andrew Mitchell will be forced to make grovelling public apologies in the Commons on Tuesday.

Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones, who are accused of ‘stitching up’ Mitchell, were told by MPs yesterday they will be found guilty of contempt of Parliament if they refuse.

MPs could, in theory, use their historic power to imprison the pair, though in practice that is highly unlikely.

Denial: Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton (left) said he did not call Theresa May 'that woman' and Sergeant Chris Jones has been subject to 13 complaints

The humiliation follows the publication today of a damning report into the police handling of ‘Plebgate’. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f****** pleb’ when he declined to let him cycle through the gates at No 10.

The report by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee effectively accuses police of a conspiracy to cover up the way they lied in a successful bid to force Mr Mitchell’s resignation from the Cabinet.

The bombshell report accuses ‘mendacious’ Det Sgt Hinton of lying by denying he referred to Home Secretary Theresa May as ‘that woman’.

It also claims Sgt Jones lied by saying he had not been involved in disciplinary inquiries in the past – police have now admitted there had been 13 complaints against him.

The publication Lambasts the three chief constables who handled the complaint for a ‘lack of leadership’.

Two
chief constables were also critcised for failing to launch a 
disciplinary probe into the conduct of Hinton and Jones, who, together 
with a third Police Federation representative, Ken MacKaill, were 
accused of plotting to get Mitchell sacked.

Last
night, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) watchdog 
ordered a new inquiry into the three policemen. In a statement Home 
Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘We were appalled by the 
evidence given by Det Sgt Hinton, Sgt Jones and Inspector MacKaill. It 
is now clear Hinton and Jones misled the committee, possibly 
deliberately.

In the firing line: Chief Constables Chris Sims, left, David Shaw, centre, and Andy Parker are accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation

‘We have recalled them to correct the record and if they do not, they will be in prima facie contempt of Parliament.’ Insp MacKaill could also be hauled before Parliament if there was evidence he had misled the committee.

Mr Vaz added: ‘Instead of being transparent, we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth. If this can happen to a Cabinet Minister, what hope is there for anyone else?’

The MPs report follows the row over a meeting last October between Mr Mitchell and the Police Federation as he fought to save his Cabinet seat after the incident at the Downing Street gates.

MacKaill, Hinton and Jones were accused of deliberately misrepresenting what Mr Mitchell said at the meeting. Tory MPs claim it played a  large part in Mr Mitchell losing his job as Chief Whip days  later – and was part of a Police Federation campaign against government cuts in the  police force.

The MPs say Hinton’s denial when quizzed by MPs that he had referred to Mrs May as ‘that woman’ was ‘mendacious when he has subsequently informed us the woman referred to must be the Home Secretary’.

Forced out: Ex-Minister Andrew Mitchell resigned after the incident at Downing Street

Hinton has apologised in writing to MPs – but the committee wants him to say sorry to them in person on Tuesday.

Sgt Jones is savaged for not owning up to having been the subject of 13 disciplinary complaints when he gave evidence to MPs.

They said: ‘It is a serious matter to mislead a parliamentary committee.’

Hinton, Jones and MacKaill are denounced for their ‘stubborn and unashamed refusal’  to apologise to Mr Mitchell.

The three chief constables in the firing line are David Shaw (West Mercia), Chris Sims (West Midlands) and Andy Parker (Warwickshire) who were accused of failing to carry out a thorough investigation.

‘There was an absence of leadership by all three chief constables at a critical time,’ say the MPs.

IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass last night ordered a new misconduct probe by the IPCC itself into the three Police Federation men.

She said the ‘catalogue of irregularities’ had undermined public confidence.

She added: ‘The only investigation that would satisfy the public interest and maintain confidence in the police is an independent one, carried out by the IPCC’s own staff, and this is what will now take place.’
