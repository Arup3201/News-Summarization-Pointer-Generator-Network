One picture shows a cluster of indistinct circles. Another shows a delighted couple and the smiling healthy baby that they thought they may never have.

And it was the first IVF image that finally gave Laura Lawrence and her husband Richard hope that they would one day be able to appear in a picture like the second.

It is the same baby in each – the first taken at three days after conception and showing a group of just eight cells, the second now that their daughter Matilda is eight months old.

Laura and Richard Lawrence were able to watch baby Matilda (now eight-months-old) develop in the womb from just three days after she was conceived via IVF technology 

Usually expectant parents cannot see their growing baby until the 12-week scan, at which point it is around 2in long with its head, limbs and body visible.

But incredibly, thanks to the revolutionary introduction of time-lapse photography in IVF treatment, Mrs Lawrence, 39, and her 50-year-old husband were given a first glimpse of Matilda before she was even implanted in the womb.

The technology, which is only available in a handful of clinics, works by taking a picture every five to ten minutes so doctors can monitor how quickly the embryo develops from one crucial stage to another within the first few days of its life.

It means only the most successful embryos are implanted and has been credited with doubling the success rate of IVF pregnancies.

Mrs Lawrence, who suffered from severe endometriosis and ovarian cysts, received help from the EmbryoScope technology as part of her £6,000 IVF treatment at the Hewitt Fertility Centre in Knutsford, Cheshire.

But, even with its aid, she only had a 23 per cent chance of having a baby. Without it, her chances were negligible.

Matilda was born in May last year by caesarean section weighing 8lb 12oz.

Mrs Lawrence, a British Airways cabin crew member, said: ‘She is my absolute miracle. Looking at that picture, you can’t believe that blob swimming around would turn into a beautiful girl.

‘Very few people can see that sort of image, so early on, but it gives you that extra little bit of confidence.

First appearance: In a petri dish, the cells that would become Matilda just a few days after she was conceived

Growing: A scan of the baby at 32 weeks. The couple said watching their baby develop from earlier gave them 'an extra bit of confidence' that she would be born healthy 

The couple struggled to conceive naturally for two years before resorting to private IVF treatment

‘It was so exciting but nerve-wracking at the same time. You are just hoping it is going to work.’

Because medical writer Mr Lawrence already has two sons, aged 17 and 11, the couple, from Macclesfield in Cheshire, who met in 2010 and married last year, were not entitled to IVF treatment on the NHS. After trying to conceive naturally for two years they resorted to private treatment.

Mrs Lawrence added: ‘I cannot believe I have this little girl who is so full of life.

‘I look at my beautiful girl and I just think I’m the luckiest person.’

The EmbryoScope takes images of the embryo in a petri dish so doctors can analyse its viability without having to disturb it.

Time-lapse technology in IVF is a relatively new concept, with the world’s first baby conceived using Eeva-assisted (Early Embryo Viability Assessment) IVF born in Liverpool in May 2013.

Studies have shown it can reduce the risk of miscarriage by over a third. The Hewitt Fertility Centre now offers it to all couples having IVF treatment.

Lead clinician Dr Rafet Gazvani said: ‘Time-lapse technology has revolutionised the management of IVF and increased our success rates significantly.’
