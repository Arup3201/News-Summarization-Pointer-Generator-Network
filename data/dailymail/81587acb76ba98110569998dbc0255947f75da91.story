Jay Leno would stay at the Tonight Show if he were not being replaced by Jimmy Fallon, he has revealed.

'If he wasn't here, would I still be here?' Leno said on the Today show on Monday as he appeared in his first joint interview with Fallon. 'Probably another year or so.'

But he insisted that he was ready to leave what he called 'the greatest job in show business'.

Leno, 63, will pass the show's torch to Fallon, 39, next month and in their interview, they insisted there was no animosity over the shake up.

'Obviously I look up to Jay,' Fallon told Matt Lauer. 'I love his attention to detail. He roots for me.'

When asked about the nature of their relationship, Leno was blunt, saying: 'I think it's a professional relationship. I really admire him as a comic. I admire his professionalism.'

He praised Fallon's versatility and ability to work beside younger stars, such as Justin Timberlake - an attribute which he said made Fallon similar to Leno's predecessor, Johnny Carson.

Fallon, who is currently the host of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, said he was not sure what to expect ahead of his new role on February 17.

'I dont know what to expect if it's going to be any different or what,' he told Lauer. 'With this one I feel like there are more eyeballs.'

'I hope I make you proud,' he added to Leno.

Fallon was officially named as the next host of the program in April 2013. He will be replaced by Saturday Night Live star Seth Meyers on Late Night when he moves into the earlier time slot.

The pressure was on right from the start as long-time host Leno told Fallon he was 'counting on' him to keep network ratings high.

Leno has hosted the late night show since 1992, apart from a contentious seven-month stint by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Leno returned after ratings plummeted.

Fallon will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over, with industry insiders predicted that his $5 million salary will reach $12 million in the new role.

Even though it's three million less than the $15 million Leno reportedly takes home, it still represents a massive show of faith in Fallon, who has been working late night television for less than five years.

Ahead of the announcement of the takeover, Leno had made repeated jokes about his bosses and the network.

Lenoâ€™s final 
show on February 6 will see Billy Crystal be interviewed as country star
 Garth Brooks acts as musical guest.

A host of other big names will appear on
 the last week including Betty White, Matthew McConaughey
 and Sandra Bullock, country singer Blake Shelton, musician Lyle Lovett 
and basketball legend Charles Barkley.

Fallon will welcome Will Smith and U2 on his first show.
