Alexandre Pato smashed an egg on Kaka's head in Sao Paulo training, on the day the team heard the news that Kaka was in Dunga's Brazil squad.

Kaka later got his revenge as the former AC Milan duo both saw the funny side of the egging incident.

Kaka was re-called on Friday to Brazil's national team after an absence of more than 18 months.

Dunga called up the playmaker to replace injured Cruzeiro midfielder Ricardo Goulart in the match against Argentina on October 11 in Beijing and for the game against Japan in Singapore three days later.

The 32-year-old Kaka, a member of Brazil's squad at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, hadn't been called up to the Selecao since a friendly against Russia in March last year, when Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge.

Goulart was dropped because of a muscle injury. Dunga also had to replace Chelsea's Ramires with Sao Paulo midfielder Souza and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos with Inter Milan's Juan.

The match against Argentina, the Super Classic of the Americas, is organized by South American football's governing body.

'I'm incredibly happy to be back,' Kaka said. 'After a long time away from the national team, this comes as a reward for the work that I have been doing. It shows that I've been doing something good.'

'I hope I can add a lot to the national team with my experience. I think I can help.'
