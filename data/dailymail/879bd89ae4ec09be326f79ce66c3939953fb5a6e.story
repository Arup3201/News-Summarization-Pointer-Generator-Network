He may be able to fly - but this Scottish Superman appears to have trouble finding the shops.

Joker Kevin Hannaway was filmed apparently flying along outside the window of a workman's moving van in the stunted-up video shot on a country road outside Cambuslang near Glasgow.

The film - which shows the 'superhero' asking for directions - has been viewed thousands of times around the world after it was posted online earlier this week.

Kevin Hannaway appears to fly alongside a workman's van in a video posted on YouTube

The video shows a van driver motoring along a country road and commenting: 'We've finished our shift. We're quite happy. It's a wee Friday.'

The camera then pans to the driver's left to show Mr Hannaway, 24, in a Superman-pose outside the passenger-side window.

As bushes and trees hurtle past, he manages to stiffle his giggles as he calmly chats to the driver.

He says: 'Excuse me, how do I get to the shops from here, boys?' to which the laughing driver replies 'stick to the left'.

Blacksmith Mr Hannaway then says 'All right buddy, is that me then' and 'Cheerio' before appearing to fly off away from the van.

The video has since been sent around the world by internet users, attracting scores of comments.

Cameron 
Church tweeted 'Scottish Humour at its best.... #OneToWatch', Neville 
Foster wrote 'Great, just flipping great..Good on you guys..﻿' and Simon
 Gilbert added 'hilarious'.

Mr
 Hannaway has said the van slowed down and he was cycling alongside, but
 a frame of the video appears to show the van's side door open and his 
hand holding onto the passenger seat's head-rest.

Mr Hannaway chats to the driver as the van heads along a country road in near Cambuslang, Scotland. After getting directions to the shops, he bids the driver 'Cheerio' before turning and appearing to fly off

He told the Daily Record: 'We used to make a lot of videos so we just did it for a bit of a laugh. The idea just popped into my head one day and I thought I’d try it out.'

But motoring groups have criticised the move, with AA president Edmund King saying: 'Superman should stick to the big screen rather than doing dangerous stunts on rural roads.

'Whether he is going along on a bike or hanging out of the side door, the van would only have to hit a pothole and his super strength would be severely tested.'

Following the commments, Mr Hannaway urged others not to copy his act, adding: 'They should leave it to the real Clark Kent.'

After the stunt was criticised by safety groups, Mr Hannaway said flying should be left to the real Clark Kent, played here by Christopher Reeve in the 1978 film
