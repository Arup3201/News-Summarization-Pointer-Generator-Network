You can pick up a tablet for less than £30 these days, but very little separates one model from another.

In a bid to create 'something different', an Ohio-based inventor decided to build his own, complete with touchscreen, USB ports, and apps.

Called the PiPad, the 10.75-inch tablet is powered by a Raspberry Pi computer and runs on the Linux-based Raspian Operating system.

Ohio-based inventor Michael Castor spent two weeks building the PiPad device, pictured. The 10.75-inch tablet is powered by a Raspberry Pi computer and runs on the Linux-based Raspbian operating system

Price (for parts): $350 (£210)

Screen size: 10-inch

Dimensions: 10.75" x 7.5" x 1"

Operating system: Raspbian OS

Processor: Raspberry Pi B

Battery: 10,000mAh

This means it can run apps created for the Linux operating system.

However, the DIY tablet doesn’t come cheap and all the individual parts will set you back around $350 (£210).

'It seems that every day a manufacturer comes out with a new tablet computer - thinner, lighter, faster, but it seems that they all look about the same and accomplish roughly the same things,’ sad ’ said designer Michael Castor.

‘When I set out to build my Raspberry Pi tablet I wanted something different.

'I wanted an all-in-one system that was usable, portable, and Linux based. Additionally, it had to look good.'

The casing of the PiPad is made from Baltic birch plywood and carbon fibre.

The PiPad is fitted with a 10,000aMh battery, which Castor claims provides up to six hours run time. It also has USB and Ethernet ports, plus an audio jack, so Castor can watch videos and listen to music. A Bluetooth chip lets users connect a wireless mouse and keyboard

The processor is the Raspberry Pi B model, pictured, and because it runs on the existing Raspbian operating system, the PiPad features a web browser and apps

It is 10.75-inch long, 7.5-inch wide and an inch thick, and because it runs on the existing Raspbian operating system, it features a web browser and apps.

The PiPad features a capacitive 10-inch touchscreen, USB and Ethernet ports and an audio jack, so Castor can watch videos and listen to music.

By comparison the iPad Air has a 9.7-inch screen and is only 0.29-inch thick.

Elsewhere, the tablet is fitted with a 10,000mAh battery which Castor claims offers around six hours of run time.

The front and rear sections of the case, pictured top and bottom, clip together. In order to house the DIY parts, the PiPad is an inch thick. It is 10.75-inches long and 7.5-inches wider

The PiPad's 10-inch capacitive touchscreen, pictured, is just 0.3-inches bigger than the screen on the Apple iPad

Although Castor spent months designing the PiPad, and acquiring all the parts needed to build it, the construction only took two weeks.

Castor recently took the device to a Maker Faire in New York, where he met Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton, who praised the device and signed the rear casing.

‘Overall I’m very happy with my Raspberry Pi tablet,’ said Castor. ‘It does what I want it to do and has been a great way to demonstrate the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi at Maker Faires [where] the device gets constant compliments from makers.’

Future versions of the PiPad could additionally feature a camera and infra-red sensors.

To prevent the padded Raspberry Pi and other components, pictured, from overheating, Castor bought Heatsinks from Amazon
