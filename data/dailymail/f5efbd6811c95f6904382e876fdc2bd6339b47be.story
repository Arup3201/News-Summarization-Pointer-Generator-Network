This 'happiness map of Britain' shows how mothers living in the UK's most remote spots are among the happiest people in the country - as a study found women are generally more content than men.

The report also showed women appear to experience more anxiety and found geographical ‘hotspots’ where people could expect a better life, singling out the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland.

Those based in London, Luton and Reading were deemed to have the lowest well-being in the UK, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) think-tank report found.

The think-tank examined recent Office 
for National Statistics data and released its findings as the Government
prepared to publish the first set of figures to offer an insight into 
UK quality of life.

Prime Minister David Cameron launched 
the Measuring National Wellbeing programme in November 2010 after 
deciding the Government needed to be well informed on public well-being.

This will be measured alongside gross 
domestic product as a means of determining whether Government policies 
are making Britain a better place to live.

He said the country ‘would be better 
off if we thought about well-being as well as economic growth’, adding 
that GDP was too ‘crude’ a measure of progress as it failed to consider 
wider social factors.

According to the NEF analysis, quality of life is highest among older people and the retired.

The study offered an optimistic 
picture of life in rural Britain which, it concluded, was significantly 
better than in the UK's urban areas.

It also identified greater contentment
among older and retired people but revealed something of a mid-life 
crisis, with those between the ages of 40 and 59 experiencing the lowest
quality of living.

Britain is doing something right'

It found parents tended to be happier than those without children, as were married people and those who live with a partner.

NEF senior researcher Saamah Abdallah said: ‘When it comes to retirement, 
Britain is doing something right.

‘The high levels of wellbeing reported
by the over-60s are not a global phenomenon, in many countries older 
age groups have the lowest wellbeing.

He added: ‘But there are also high levels of inequality in well-being amongst the elderly in the UK.

'The data will revolutionise public policy, not just in the UK but globally. We have the potential to transform the way people talk about this'

Lord O'Donnell, ex-Cabinet Secretary

‘Of particular concern to policy 
makers are the low levels of well-being most disabled people report. It 
suggests a need for further research and intervention.’

Former Cabinet Secretary Lord 
O'Donnell, who is chairing the Government's Well Being Commission, said 
he hoped the data could revolutionise policy making.

‘It will revolutionise public policy, 
not just in the UK but globally,’ he said. ‘We have the potential to 
transform the way people talk about this.’

The NEF analysis drew on the responses of 160,000 people to the ONS Annual Population Survey.
