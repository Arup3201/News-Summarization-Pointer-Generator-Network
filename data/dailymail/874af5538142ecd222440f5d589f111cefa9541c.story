Jose Mourinho cut a confident figure on declaring that leaders Chelsea would definitely win the title in any other country from this commanding position.

The Blues comfortably beat a gallant Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park to maintain their blistering start to a season which some believe could end with them emulating the Arsenal 'Invincibles' of a decade ago.

Looking as relaxed as he has done all year, Mourinho had two words to describe why Chelsea didn’t succumb to defeat as they did at Palace in March, scribbling ‘big balls’ on a pad of paper. He had written ‘balls’ to sum up what they had lacked on losing four months ago.

Mourinho - who has already manufactured a five-point gap over champions Manchester City - was mindful of respecting the competition, although it is clear that anything other than clinching a first title since 2010 would be deemed a failure.

They may have to do that while constantly managing the fitness of Diego Costa, who is ruled out of the Champions League clash against Maribor on Tuesday. Once again the manager chose to snipe at the way in which Spain have treated his star striker.

‘If you were in another league I would say immediately “yes, we’ll do it”. In the Premier League the only thing I can say is that we can do it,’ Mourinho said.

‘In the Premier League it is stupid to say you’re going to do it because there are so many good teams and a long way to go - some very difficult runs in front of us.

‘What is obvious - what you all feel - is that we are a better team than last season. There is a clear evolution. It’s not based on the fact that we bought two fantastic players [Costa and Cesc Fabregas].’

Costa was absent for the first time this campaign and remains a doubt for next Sunday’s trip to Manchester United.

‘After Arsenal he went to the national team, played two big matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg and has come back in a condition where he isn’t available for his club,’ Mourinho added.

Asked if he had spoken to the Spanish medical staff, the 51-year-old was sardonic in reply.

‘For what? To spend money on calls? No.

Warnock was furious with the decision to send off of Damien Delaney (not pictured)

‘I think he’ll be in great condition in mid-November to be back for the national team. We’ll take good care of him. He’ll play for me when he has free time from the national team.’ 

Despite Mourinho's humorous scribblings it was no laughing matter for Neil Warnock, who bemoaned big-club bias after claiming a number of Craig Pawson's decisions were unfair on the Eagles.

‘Half the team surrounded the referee,’ he said. ‘I thought they influenced him at times today. I thought John Terry should have been booked early on [for a late challenge on Fraizer Campbell]. He left a lot to be desired - the ref has had better days.’
