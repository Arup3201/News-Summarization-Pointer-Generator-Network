This astonishing video shows a young mother-of-two downing a pint of lager in just five seconds. 

Siobhan Cranstoun, 26, is filmed picking up the pint glass with her mouth in the video taken at the King's Head in Beverley, East Yorkshire, and swallowing the beer in a matter of seconds.  

The clip has been shared more than 40,000 times on Facebook after being uploaded by Miss Cranstoun's boyfriend, Jon Crowther.

The mother-of-two then throws back the pint with her head, chugging the lager down to the amazement of her boyfriend 

But despite receiving thousands of compliments from men impressed with her drinking stamina, the 26-year-old said she does not advise anyone to copy her stunt when they are out drinking. 

Dressed in a white jack and top, Miss Cranstoun looks at the camera with the pint of beer sat in front of her before asking 'ready' at the start of the clip. 

She is then filmed picking the glass up with her teeth and downing the beer in 5.5 seconds. 

Within seconds the entire pint has been swallowed, with a voice in the background heard saying: 'What!' 

There are 2.3 units in a pint of beer, which falls within the recommended daily intake for women. 

Women are not meant to exceed 2-3 units on a regular basis, while men should not exceed 3-4 limits. 

Alcohol poisoning is a risk of drinking too much, and can often occur when you drink too much in a short space of time. 

Symptoms include vomiting, dizziness, confusion and having trouble communicating.

Accompanied with the caption: 'realising my gf can down a pint in 5.5 seconds omg (sic)' the video has been 'liked' by almost 200,000 people on Facebook. 

While Mr Crowther, 30,  added: 'Remember drink responsibly!!! (sic)', some critics fear the video promotes dangerous alcohol consumption. 

Speaking of the video, Miss Cranstoun said she was surprised by how many people had taken notice. 

'Although at the time I drank that pint quickly I didn't do it to cause attention,' the 26-year-old said. 

'It was merely the case of finishing off my drink before we moved on to the next bar as me and my partner were celebrating his 30th birthday in Beverley with friends . 

'My partner filmed it as he had also filmed other moments during the night. As he was shocked at how quickly I drank it, he uploaded the clip to Facebook. 

'To be completely honest the attention has been staggering . I fully understand I drank irresponsibly and do not advise anybody to copy (me)'. 

The 26-year-old finishes off the drink in just over five seconds, keeping her hands in the air while she downs the last of the pint 

The video has been shared more than 40,000 times on Facebook after being uploaded on Friday night. Miss Cranstoun is thought to live in Hull and has two children 

The couple were out celebrating Mr Crowther's 30th birthday when he filmed Miss Cranstoun downing the drink 

Miss Cranstoun said while she was finishing her drink quickly so the group could move on to another bar, she does not advise anyone to behave as she did
