The man accused of killing iconic missing child Etan Patz will today learn whether he will face trial over the six-year-old's murder.

Pedro Hernandez apparently confessed to abducting and choking the boy, who was on his way to school when he disappeared in Manhattan in 1979.

But his lawyer now says he made a false confession thanks to mental illness, and argues that there is not enough evidence to put him on trial.

A judge in New York is due to rule today on whether or not the case should be thrown out.

Hernandez, 52, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, was arrested last year and told police he had killed Etan in a store where he was working.

But his lawyer Harvey Fishbein has said that the suspect is schizophrenic and bipolar, and made a confession full of questionable claims only after almost seven hours of police questioning.

'No evidence or witnesses have been found corroborating any of the few facts' in the confession, Mr Fishbein wrote in papers filed with the court last month.

The Manhattan district attorney's office insists that Hernandez's confession is legitimate, as he talked to police willingly and the details in it are credible.

New York law states that a suspect can be convicted based solely on a confession as long as there is evidence that a crime was in fact committed.

'The evidence before the grand jury amply supports the offences charged,' prosecutors wrote in a filing a few months ago.

Etan became the first nationally famous missing child when he disappeared while walking to a bus stop in his SoHo neighbourhood.

He was one of the first children to have their faces printed on milk cartons in an unsuccessful attempt to find him.

Last year, investigators dug up the streets near where he vanished, but did not discover any trace of his body.

However, the increased publicity led to Hernandez's arrest after it was claimed that he had previously told people that he once killed a child in New York City.

The suspect told police he had seen Etan at the bus stop and lured him to a local bodega where he worked by offering him a soda.

Hernandez said he had then choked the boy to death, put his body in a box and left it in a pile of trash nearby.
