On the run: Lee Cyrus, who is serving a life sentence, became a fugitive when he failed to return from day release

The police are hunting for a ‘dangerous and predatory’ fugitive who is suspected to have committed a serious sex offence while on the run.

Police have released images and CCTV footage of Ivan Leach, also known as Lee Cyrus, who is serving a life sentence for robbery, after he escaped on October 9.

Despite a large scale police search and several sightings of the 47-year-old fugitive, Cyrus remains at large.

He is believed to have carried out a very serious sexual attack in Tayside, Scotland, since he absconded although further details cannot be released for legal reasons, Lancashire Police said.

Lancashire Police are also investigating reports that two schoolgirls were approached for sex as they sat at a bus stop around 6.30pm on Lancaster Road in Preston city centre on October 17.

The girls were spoken to by a man who matched his description and made sexual remarks towards them as he encouraged them to participate in sexual activities with him. The girls boarded a bus and reported the incident to  police.

Cyrus failed to return to North Sea 
Camp open prison in Boston, Lincolnshire after day release while serving
a life sentence for assaulting and robbing a 90-year-old woman in Ribbleton, 
Lancashire.

He also has 
convictions for burglary, sex offences against a young girl and assault where he targeted elderly people in their homes.

The CCTV footage, believed to be of Cyrus in Preston city centre, the area he has lived in, on October 17.

Believed to be the suspect: Police release CCTV footage of a man in Preston city centre on October 17 as he remains at large despite several sightings of the 47-year-old

Preston-born Cyrus has visited his home city on a number of occasions while on the run but he could be anywhere in the country.

Police have been searching the Kinnoull and Potterhill Gardens areas, in Perth Scotland after several reported sightings.

Inquiries are ongoing in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Tayside.

Police warned the public to be 
‘vigilant’ and not to approach the man but to report sightings to police
as ‘any information members of the public can provide could be crucial 
to apprehending this man,’ a police spokesman said.

Police
told people to lock their doors and windows. They also recommended 
women not walk with earphones in in case it prevented them from hearing 
him approaching.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Dawson,
of Preston Police, said: 'Leach is an extremely dangerous and predatory
individual who poses a serious threat to members of the public.

'He has previous convictions for 
burglary, sex offences against a young girl, assault and robberies in 
which he has targeted elderly people in their own homes.

'We believe he could be sleeping 
rough and travelling extensively throughout the country. He has a number
of links to Preston and prior to his sentence lived and offended in the
Preston area.

'We are liaising with a number of other forces in a bid to track him down and apprehend him but we need the public's help.'

Tayside
Police’s appeal on Wednesday came a day before a 23-year-old woman was 
seriously sexually assaulted in her home in nearby Potterhill Gardens. 
Today police were unable to confirm if the attack was linked to Cyrus.

Several sightings: As well as the believed sighting on CCTV in Preston city centre (pictured), police are searching the Kinnoull and Potterhill areas in Scotland after several reported sightings

A suspicious male, fitting Cyrus’ 
description, was also seen that day on the A90 to Dundee road running 
into the woods at Kinnoull Hill.

The man was spotted by an off-duty officer at about 7.20am but he disappeared again.

Around
30 police officers searched the area around Kinnoull Hill, including 
search trained officers, dogs, the Tayside Police Search and Rescue Team
and a police helicopter.

A
police statement said: ‘At the time he wore muddy dark coloured 
waterproofs (trousers and top) and a beanie hat. He was carrying a 
rucksack style bag.’

He has been described by police as 
‘being white, around five feet 11 inches tall, of stocky build with 
cropped hair and hazel eyes’.

Inspector Dawson said: 'I'd reassure 
people that we follow up every potential sighting of him so I'd urge 
people to call police on 101 if you think you see him or know of his 
current whereabouts. I would remind people that he is violent and should
not be approached. We have extra patrols in the city and continue to 
have officers out looking for him round the clock and we are doing 
everything we can to find him.

'The best possible outcome for himself, his family and all concerned is that he gives himself up.

'We believe he may have stubble or may now have grown a beard. He could also be carrying a rucksack.'
