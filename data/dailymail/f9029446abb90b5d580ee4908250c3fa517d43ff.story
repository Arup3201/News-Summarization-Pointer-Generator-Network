Four New Jersey teens face sexual assault charges as prosecutors say they not only attacked a severely intoxicated girl but showed video of the assault to their friends.

Craig Howe, 18, Justin Draper, 18, and Ashari Wilson, 18, of Elmwood Park, have each been charged in the case along with one as-yet-unidentified 17-year-old male suspect.

Prosecutors charged the boys after an unnamed girl, 15, claimed that at least three of them had sexually assaulting her at a June 21 backyard gathering.

Ashari Wilson, 18, is accused of filming a sexual assault and faces charges of manufacturing child pornography, endangering the welfare of a minor, hindering apprehension, invasion of privacy, and possession of child pornography

Teens Justin Draper and Craig Howe allegedly sexually assaulted the girl at a gathering this June while she was heavily intoxicated

NJ.com reports the girl was discovered by her parents unconscious on the front lawn of their Elmwood Park home with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit at 0.27.

She later told police that the unidentified 17-year-old told her they had sex on the night in question.

She told police she had no memory of this claim but that she later saw a video of her being sexually assaulted by multiple men while she was intoxicated.

Police say the site of the alleged attack is the residence of Howe and Wilson at 100 Falmout Ave.Â 

Draper, Howe, and the 17-year-old allegedly penetrated the girl as Wilson filmed it on an iPhone, prosecutors said.

The video has since been added to the evidence against them.

The alleged attack took place at this home on Falmout Avenue in Elmwood Park where Howe and Wilson reside

The 17-year-old has been charged with a juvenile complaint of aggravated sexual assault, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer.

Draper and Howe are both being held in Bergen County Jail on $150,000 bail and face one count each of aggravated sexual assault.

Wilson is in the same facility and is being held on $200,000 bail, and faces charges of manufacturing child pornography, endangering the welfare of a minor, hindering apprehension, invasion of privacy, and possession of child pornography.
