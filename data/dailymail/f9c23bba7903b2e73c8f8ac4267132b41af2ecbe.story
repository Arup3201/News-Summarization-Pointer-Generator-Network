When stay-at-home dad Brian Reda took a picture of himself and his son at the zoo, he decided to jazz it up a little by throwing a devil horn salute in the bottom of the frame.

Little did he know that, when he posted the picture on message board Reddit, he would be roundly criticised by users for using the 'offensive' gesture in front of a young boy.

However, he has now hit back at his critics by posting a series of 'Dad life' images online - everyday scenes from life with his nine-month-old son Livingston, with each one featuring the rock 'n' roll hand gesture.

Photographer Brian, from St Paul Minnesota, said: 'Some people put up quite the stink about the "metal hand" in the picture of my son at the zoo.

'I'm a stay at home dad and that's the way I've to chosen to document our life together. So suck it. Dad life is metal.'

Brian said he wanted to use the pictures to capture everyday life with his nine-month-old son Livingston

At first Brian was criticsed online for using the 'offensive' gesture in front of the child, but now other parents have come out in support of him

In response to critics, Brian gave a 'most metal' shout-out to his wife, Angela (left) for carrying and giving birth to Livingston, and for supporting the pair ever since
