Manuel Neuer accepted responsibility as Bayern Munich suffered a surprise defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach but said the whole team were not good enough to win.

Bayern were beaten 2-0 at home by Monchengladbach after Raffael scored either side of half time.

He said: ‘We didn’t create any genuine chances. That wasn’t good enough,' Neuer said.

‘Gladbach were very good and defended excellently.

Neuer admitted his own mistakes during Bayern's defeat by Gladbach

Neuer says he should have done better to keep out Raffael's goal

‘Obviously we wanted to do much better and we’ve missed a chance because Wolfsburg dropped points.

‘But it won’t darken our mood. We know what we’re aiming for this season. We’ll look to the future and we’re optimistic.’

Bayern still lead the Bundesliga by 10 points from Wolfsburg, while Borussia Monchengladbach are third.

And Neuer was at fault for the opening goal and the German No 1 admitted he should have done better on Raffael's strike.

‘It was the first shot on target from Gladbach. I wanted to catch it and hold on to it. I just should have played it safe and palmed it away.’
