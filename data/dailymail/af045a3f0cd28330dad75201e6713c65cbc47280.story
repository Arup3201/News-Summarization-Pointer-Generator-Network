A pensioner who lost her wedding ring 55 years ago has been reunited with the gold band after an expert metal detector took just two hours to find it.

Joan MacLeod was helping her parents to gather corn on a croft in 
Kirkhill, Inverness in August 1958 when the 22 carat ring slipped from her finger.

Despite a thorough search, she was unable to find it and eventually her husband Duncan bought a replacement, though they have kept their eyes peeled for the last five decades in the hope of being reunited with it.

But it took Eric Soane, 75, just two 
hours to track the ring down after the couple, now both 77, saw him 
using his metal detector in a field and set him the challenge of finding
 it.

Joan MacLeod, 77, has been reunited with the wedding ring she lost five years ago while gathering corn

Soane is one of Scotland's top three suppliers of treasure trove and has previously discovered  hoard of Roman coins and Robert II coins at Belladrum in 2012, and 600 artefacts at Fort George.

Mrs MacLeod said: 'He produced this little plastic bag from his pocket and said "look what I found"; I just thought I would hit the floor.'

'It wonâ€™t go on properly now because I have a touch of arthritis and my joints are slightly swollen but I am going to take it to my jeweller to see if he will stretch it. I do not want to cut it.'

Mrs MacLeod, of Cabrich, Kirkhill, recalled the turmoil of losing her precious ring, adding: 'I was helping to gather the corn. I had gloves on but the wool got worn and it must have slipped off. I just about went crazy.

'The following day my mum went down with a big sheet and shook out the shears of corn to see if the ring had fallen into it.

After a fruitless search Joan and her husband Duncan bought a replacement but have kept the search up for the last five decades in the hope of one day finding the ring

'She must have spent the whole day because I was at work. I was crying my eyes out. I felt terrible. How careless for goodness sake.'

Mr MacLeod came home from serving in the air force and bought her another ring but it never replaced the original for his wife.

Mr Soane, who is a retired social worker from Tornagrain, near Nairn, said: 'I dug down about six inches into the soil and I saw it straight away. The ring was shining bright from the mud.'
