A sheet of blotting paper used on the armistice document that brought about the end of the First World War has emerged for sale for £30,000.

The sheet carries the inky signatures of military leaders Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, First Sea Lord, and Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the French leader of the Allied forces, who had been sent to France in November 1918 to thrash out a peace deal with the Germans.

After four days of tense negotiations conducted in two railway carriages deep in the heart of the French countryside, a historic truce was reached.

Top brass from all sides signed the armistice, which was aimed at restoring peace to the world after four years of bitter fighting.

Captain John Marriott, Admiral Wemyss' naval assistant during the negotiations, was acutely aware of the significance of the peace deal.

After the document had been signed, the quick-thinking captain picked up the scrap of paper which had been used to blot the signatures of the dignitaries and pocketed it.

Later, Admiral Wemyss wrote on the paper: 'This blotting paper was a signature of armistice with Germany 5 am 11/11/18/ in the Compiegne Forest. R.E. Wemyss.'

Two days before the deal was struck, Capt Marriott wrote a poignant letter to his wife Margaret describing the negotiations.

He wrote: 'Here we are out in the middle of a lovely forest on a beautiful day. The Boche is in a similar train about 200' off & we await the reply to our armistice terms which have gone to Germany.

'We had 2 meetings y'day & I have never seen a more miserable lot of men, I feel they know the game is up and are terrified of Bolshevism.

'They say they are very hungry in the Country & badly in need of everything.

'War is a Godless business and I do so hope we shall finish it all by Monday. We shall be here possibly till then but one never knows anyhow, after this business we are off home again.

'It is a historic meeting this without a doubt & I shall never forget it, please God we pull it off & as far as I can see I think we shall...'

A blow-by-blow account of the talks written by Capt Marriott has also come to light, revealing the moment he was tasked to call George V with news of the armistice.

He wrote: 'At 5.a.m. orders were issued to cease hostilities at 11 a.m. afloat, ashore and in the air.

'I was told by Admiral Wemyss to ring up BUCKINGHAM PALACE and inform HIS MAJESTY; the line was dreadful and I must have been cut off about 30 times but finally got Charles Cust and informed him. I also told 10 Downing Street.

'We then had a glass of port and went for a walk in the Forest which was wonderfully soothing after our busy night.'

Capt Marriott's family has decided to sell the blotting paper along with the letters to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

Experts say they could fetch £30,000 when they go under the hammer in a Bonhams auction.

Luke Batterham, an expert from Bonhams, said: 'John Marriott was a naval captain who was present at the signing of the armistice in France in November 1918.

'The negotiations took several days and Capt Marriot was there throughout.

'The war had been raging for four years and Capt Marriot was very much aware of the significance of the armistice.

'After the document had been signed he picked up the blotting paper which had been used and took it with him as a souvenir of the moment.

'It really is a remarkable item. It is a wonderful record of an incredible moment in history.

'During the talks he somehow found the time to write a very poignant letter to his wife Margaret describing everything going on around him.

'He captured in words the huge significance of the armistice.

'These documents come to us directly from Capt Marriott's family and they will be of great interest to anyone interested in military or 21st century history.

'It is incredible the stories that can be held within one piece of paper.'

The armistice was signed at 5am on November 11, 1918, after Germany had requested to enter peace talks.

It was signed by Marshal Foch and Admiral Wemyss on behalf of the Allies.

The German delegates who signed it were politician Matthias Erzberger, army major General Detlof von Winterfeldt, Count Alfred von Oberndorff of the Foreign Ministry and Captain Vanselow of the Imperial Navy.

After signing the agreement Admiral Foch declared: 'This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years'.

The Second World War started twenty years and 65 days later.

The auction will take place in London on October 1.

The armistice between the Allies and Germant was known as the Armistice of Compiègne after the place where it was signed in the French countryside.

It went into effect at 11am on November 11 1918 marking victory for the Allies.

There were 35 terms including the end of hostilities, withdrawal of troops to behind their own borders, the exchange of prisoners and the promise of war reparations. It also included the disposition of German warships and submarines.

The armistice - largely written by the French Marshal Ferdinand Foch - ended fighting, but it took a further six months of negotiations to conclude the peace deal, the Treaty of Versailles.

The armistice brought an end to the First World War and came into effect at 11am on November 11, 1918

But Foch considered the Treaty to be 'a capitulation, a treason' believing only the permanent occupation of the Rhineland would grant France sufficient security against a revival of German aggression.

He is repored to have said: 'This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years' as the Treaty was being signed.

The Second World War started twenty years and 65 days later.

Many have argued that the Treaty may have helped sow the seeds for the Second World War because its terms caused such anger within Germany.

Years later, Adolf Hitler was voted in to power, promising to rip up the document.
