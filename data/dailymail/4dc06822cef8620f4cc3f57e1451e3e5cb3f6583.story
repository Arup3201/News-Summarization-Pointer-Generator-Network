Cambridgeshire County Councillor Gordon Gillick  faces complaints for his comments to three children who had been in care

A UKIP councillor faces an investigation after asking children in care how it felt ‘to be takers from the system’.

A dozen complaints have been lodged against Gordon Gillick who also demanded to know when the children would ‘give back to society’.

The 74-year-old Cambridgeshire County Councillor left other councillors stunned with his remarks, but his wife insisted he was 'challenging them' like US President John F Kennedy with his famous 'Ask not what your country can do for you' speech.

Mr Gillick was among several councillors invited to a briefing on their responsibilities as ‘corporate parents’ to protect children from abuse.

Three youngsters had made a film about their experiences in foster homes, and were explaining it to the councillors when Mr Gillick interrupted.

He asked: ‘How does it feel to be takers from the system?’

He reportedly also asked the youngsters when they would ‘start giving back to society’ before walking out of the session.

Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors have all submitted complaints about the incident.

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire County Council said: ‘The council has received 12 complaints against Cllr Gillick and these are now being looked at.

‘It would be inappropriate for the council to comment further.’

The incident is the latest embarrassment for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, which has been dogged by the outspoken remarks of its elected representatives, many of whom were only elected in May's local elections.

Conservative councillor Steve Criswell, who was at the meeting, said: ‘His comments were demeaning and totally unwarranted and he should be ashamed of himself.

‘The three young people were fine examples of how we make a difference helping them overcome adversity.’

The comments are the latest embarrassment for UKIP Leader Nigel Farage, who saw the party win 147 councillors in May

Gordon Gillick was not even supposed to be a councillor.

He was elected to Cambridgeshire County Council in May, despite not making any calls or issuing a single leaflet.

‘I just put my name down and that was that. I didn’t even ring anyone up,’ he said at the time.

His
 election in the Wisbech ward was among 147 UKIP candidates elected in 
the local elections as the party enjoyed a major surge in the polls.

The former teacher is now a theatre designer and restoration painter.   

The
 73-year-old is married to Victoria Gillick, a well-known campaigner who
 fought for doctors to be banned from giving contraception to under-16s 
without parental consent.

They have 10 children, including twin sons James, an artist, and Theodore, a sculptor.

Lib Dem leader Cllr Maurice Leeke added: ‘To be saying these people are, through no fault of their own, takers from the system, would be totally the opposite of what we should be doing.

‘Our role should be supporting them to become worthwhile adults, not rubbishing the situation they find themselves in.’

However, Mr Gillick has received the backing of UKIP, which is the third largest group on the authority.

Group leader Peter Reeve said: ‘As long as he’s being honest and transparent and saying what he believes, I’ve no problem with that.

‘It may or may not be that I agree with him or that people find his views offensive, but I would rather a councillor is honest than cover up their beliefs because they are worried about it not being politically correct.’

Mr Gillick, a former teacher, artist and theatre designer, was unable to comment on the case.

But his wife Victoria told MailOnline: ‘He is very, very popular with young people. He has 15 teenage grandchildren.

‘None of the county councillors have ever been inside a classroom. Their understanding of how you talk to 17 and 18-year-olds is you patronise them.

‘The tendency is to regard looked-after children as somehow retarded when in fact that is not the case.

‘His approach is to challenge them. He was doing a JFK: “Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country”.

‘He was asking them: have you thought of working and doing things for other people? For young people that’s an open challenge which starts a discussion.’
