He has a long white beard and a sack, but that's where the similarities end. In Siberia, he might be wearing a belt made from woolly mammoth bones and - shock, horror - not even arrive on Christmas Eve.

So spare a thought for the Russian region, where no fewer than seven different Santa figures will bring joy to children in the coming weeks.

All of them look old, with flowing white beards, and most have long histories, possibly reaching back to pagan times, but each is distinct and covers their own territory.

Intriguingly, most are accompanied by beautiful snow maidens.

Quite often at this time of year, some of these colourful Russian figures meet for friendly Santa summits, occasionally in a real ice cave.

Their expressions may be serious, but all of them aim to bring happiness and - more often than not - gifts to children who are well behaved... 

Grandfather Frost - or Ded Moroz 

Best known across Russia is Grandfather Frost - or Ded Moroz - who often carries a magical staff and is often accompanied by his snow maiden - Snegurochka.

He is the one who looks most like our own Father Christmas, yet there are also key differences.

For example, his busiest night is New Year's Eve with presents arriving at midnight.

The busiest night of the year for Grandfather Frost (right) is New Year's Eve when he delivers presents at midnight. He is often accompanied by his snow maiden, Snegurochka

He often visits excited children in their homes or at parties before New Year's Eve, and since the end of Soviet times, he also appears in some flats and houses to mark Orthodox Christmas Eve and Christmas Day on January 6 and 7.

Usually he is in red, but he is sometimes seen in blue or very occasionally white.

His traditional mode of transport is a sleigh pulled, not by reindeer, but white horses. Over the years, though, he has also resorted to the Metro and trams.

Clambering down chimneys, though, is not for him.

Grandfather Frost has a large wardrobe. He is usually dressed in red, like our own Father Christmas, but is sometimes seen wearing blue and occasionally white

Traditionally, in deep history Ded Moroz wandered around the forest, controlling the frost, bringing presents to the good, and punishments to the bad.

Unlike Santa, Grandfather Frost gives his gifts openly when he arrives with a big sack of presents. Typically, children need to show him how good they are, often reciting a poem or singing a song before he hands over the gifts, assisted by Snegurochka.

He lives not at the North Pole but in the town of Veliky Ustyug, in northern Russia, well shy of the Arctic.

It is here the Russian Post Office delivers his mail, but with this being such a large country, he has regional residences, for example at Royev Ruchey Zoo in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia.

Grandfather Frost's birthday is November 18, the coldest day ever recorded in the town of Veliky Ustyug.

The glamorous Snegurochka was originally a character from ancient fairy tales who became part of the Christmas ritual in the late 19th century. 

She remained when Stalin permitted Grandfather Frost to return two decades after the Russian Revolution.

Chyskhaan, aka the King of the Cold 

Children in Russia's largest region, the vast Sakha Republic in Siberia, are also familiar with the magnificent blue-coated Chyskhaan.

Every year, in late September and early October, he makes his way south from the Arctic Ocean to the diamond region of Sakha, also known Yakutia.

'And with his every step comes cold,' tells native Yakutian, Olga Stepanova. The region can sink below minus 60C.

At an annual conclave with Grandfather Frost, he hands over the cold each winter.

These dashing Santas are Ekhe Dyyl (left),  known for riding a bull and carries a sack of presents, and Chyskhaan (right), who hands over the cold to Grandfather Frost each winter

He has two horns, by legend one from a bull, the other from a woolly mammoth.

'Then at the end January his first horn falls off, and in middle February his second horn,' she explained.

As the snow melts, he floats back to the Arctic in the Lena River before the ritual is repeated the following winter. 

Ekhe Dyyl 

Yet another Santa-like figure is seen in this region, the coldest in Russia.

This is Ekhe Dyyl (pictured above), who shares a granddaughter, Khaarchana, with Chyskhaan. 

She likes to play with children but can only do so around New Year - the time when presents are exchanged. 

At other periods, she wears a hat that makes her invisible.

The bearded Ekhe Dyyl rides a bull, and carries a sack of presents, while Khaarchana goes around on a reindeer called Buur.

Sagaan Ubugul or White Elder

Another of the Siberian Santas is Sagaan Ubugul or White Elder, who is seen in the Buddhist republic of Buryatia.

He has a white beard and carries a stick with a dragon's head.

Sagaan Ubugul is another of the seven Santas and is known for giving sweets and candles to children in the Buddhist republic of Buryatia

His duties fall later than the others since the New Year is celebrated according to the lunar calendar in late January or early February.

He invites children and adults to Lake Baikal - the oldest lake in the world - and the gifts he bestows are health, love, family and wealth to the deserving.

To children he gives candles and sweets.

Sook Irey

In the southern Siberian republic of Tyva is a Santa who - like our own - is able to fly over the rooftops.

There is no sleigh nor any reindeer but Sook Irey flies to houses and yurts bringing gifts to children at New Year.

'His body, arms, legs consist of ice,' according to one description. 'He looks cold and tired. His hair, eyebrows, and beard covered with white frost like all the trees and bushes.

'His clothes are white, blue, reminiscent of the ice.' 

Yet while he looks old and worn, he can turn into a young man or beautiful girl, as the mood takes him.

'But he cannot warm anyone. He can only freeze,' according to the Tyva Legend of Creation.

He can be accompanied by Tugeni Eneken - Mother Winter from Evenkia.

Kysh Babayi 

 Kysh Babayi has quite an entourage, including his pretty snow maiden, Kar Kyzy

On the Western fringes of Siberia, in the largely Muslim regions of Tatarstan and Bashkiriya, is the preserve of the magical figure of Kysh Babayi, dressed in blue and seen by some as a brother to Ded Moroz.

He is accompanied by Kar Kyzy - his snow maiden - but also by a veritable collection of others, notably golden haired Altynchech - a female warrior; Takhir and Zukhra, described as a Tatar Romeo and Juliet; Shaytan, the embodiment of evil; and Batyr, a strong man.

Like Ded Moroz, he distributes presents as the New Year dawns.

Yamal Iri

While most owe their origins to old traditions, Yamal Iri - who rides a sleigh pulled by reindeer and dresses in blue - is a much newer creation.

He started presiding over Christmas in the gas-rich Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous region of northern Siberia as recently as 2007.

Yamal Iri is the youngest of the seven Santas of Siberia, first appearing as late as 2007

Yamal Iri is much like our own Santa, riding a sleigh pulled by reindeer. However his boots are made from reindeer skins and he carries a drum to drive away evil spirits

However, his character is based on old legends and he arrives with a drum made from reindeer skin to drive away evil spirits.

As well as presenting gifts to children, he spreads positive energy and brings midwinter happiness.

He lives in the Arctic, at Gornoknyazevsk village, some nine miles from the city of Salekhard, on the bank of the Ob River.

His traditional costume and boots are made from reindeer skins and his belt decorated with bones from woolly mammoths.

Putin with Ded Moroz in 2008

In December 2008, a Kremlin official claimed that Father Christmas was an 'imposter' and an 'illegal immigrant'.

Speaker of the Russian Parliament Boris Gryzlov insisted that the only authentic figure for bringing presents to Russia's children was Ded Moroz - Grandfather Frost.

Mr Gryzlov was at Velikiy Ustyug, traditional home of Ded Moroz in the far north of the country, when he said: 'No one will ever be able to take away Ded Moroz from Russia - not Santa Claus nor any other imposters.'

Behind his attacks on Santa Claus - whom he urged to 'get out of the profession, at least in Russia' - was a fear of encroaching Western influences which led to battles in the streets between Santas dressed in white beards and red coats and Ded Morozes dressed in blue.

Although he is popular now, life was not always easy for Ded Moroz.

He was persecuted under Stalin, being branded a 'priest's ally' in 1928.

At the same time, Christmas trees were banned in the early years of the USSR.

Stalin, however, relented and in 1937 Ded Moroz was rehabilitated, returning in triumph to the Moscow Palace of Unions.
