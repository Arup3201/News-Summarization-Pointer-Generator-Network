James Bird, 53, (pictured) faces a string of sex offence charges against a young pupil at a school dating back more than ten years.

A primary school headteacher is accused of forcing a nine-year-old boy to perform a sex act in his office after the pupil had been 'naughty' in class, a court heard.

James Bird, 53, faces a string of sex offence charges against a young pupil at a school dating back more than ten years.

The headteacher allegedly ordered the child into his office after he had been sent out of the classroom by his teacher.

While in his office, Bird is accused of committing four counts of gross indecency with the boy, who was aged nine and 10 at the time.

Bird, who denies the charges, was suspended from his top post at Newton Bluecoat Church of England Primary School, near Preston, Lancashire, following his arrest, which is believed to be related to incidents at another school between September 1, 2002 and April 30, 2004.

At Preston Crown Court today Michael Jones, prosecuting, said that the victim, who is now 21 years old, called police at 2.40 am on December 11 last year to report the crimes.

Mr Jones said: 'He told officers he had been forced to perform oral sex on headteacher James Bird.

'He said when he had been a naughty child for his teacher, who he didn't like, he was sent out to the headteacher's office and had to perform sexual acts.

'He said it started when he was sent out of class.

'When he was in the corridor, the defendant would take him to his office and he said this happened on seven or eight occasions.'

Bird was suspended from his job as headteacher at Newton Bluecoat CE Primary School, near Preston (pictured) following his arrest - theÂ alleged incidents are believed to have taken place at another school

Following Bird's arrest, his home address in Leyland, Lancashire, was searched and officers seized his computers, but no evidence was found.

Mr Jones added: 'It is a case of one word against the other.'

Bird is believed to have been at Newton Bluecoat for the past 10 years.

The trial continues.
