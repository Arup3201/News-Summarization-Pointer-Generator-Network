A female surfer who famously lost her arm to a shark attack at age 13 won her first major title for the first time in nearly ten years on Thursday.

Bethany Hamilton, 24, returned to surfing just a month after a 14-foot tiger shark bit off her left arm in 2003, but hadn't won a major surfing event since just after her brave return to the ocean only a month following her ordeal.

That all changed after her impressive performance at Oahu's Surf N Sea Pipeline Women's Pro, a major event held in Hawaii's Banzai Pipeline.

Amazing: It was Hamilton's first big win in nearly 10 years after she won a national title just months after losing her arm to a 14-foot tiger shark at the age of 13 in 2003

Thrilled: It was a rare win for the intrepid blonde Hawaiian, even according to her. 'I usually lose so this was great,' she said

But don't expect the tall, blonde native Hawaiian to gloat about it.

'I usually lose so this was great,' the beaming Hamilton said following her win.

Hamilton's captivating tale of fighting for what you love against all odds was immortalized in the 2011 motion picture Soul Surfer, in which she's portrayed by AnnaSophia Robb.

Hamilton beat out two fellow Hawaiians and a Japanese surfer to win $2,000 and first place.

Since her amazing comeback at such a vulnerable age, Hamilton has begun working to help others in situations similar to hers.

Her charity Friends of Bethany supports shark attack victims and other amputees.

Hamilton's uplifting tale was immortalized in the 2011 feature film Soul Surfer, which starred AnnaSophia Robb
