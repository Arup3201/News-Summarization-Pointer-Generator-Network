A teenage paedophile viciously raped a girl of 11 while he was on probation for another sex crime.

Opemipo Jaji – who was ‘obsessed with little white girls’ – dragged the girl into a park after she got off a bus from school.

She had tried to run away from him, but he caught up with her before repeatedly raping her over a three-hour period.

After the attack, the girl told police
 she tried to escape twice, but Jaji threatened to stab her, saying ‘I 
am this close to killing you’.

The attack took place 90 minutes after the 18-year-old had been seen by his  probation officer.

The trainee chef now faces life in jail after he was found guilty of the November rape at the Old Bailey yesterday.

Serious questions over how the 
authorities handled Jaji were raised last night after it emerged he was 
convicted of another sexual assault a year earlier.

In September 2011 he admitted 
attacking a 12-year-old in the same area of north London. He forced her 
to strip after grabbing her on her way home from school.

Jaji was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five months, but he was not registered as a sex offender.

Within weeks of his release he was 
convicted of possessing the most obscene category of images of child 
abuse after downloading videos of white girls.

He was given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order which required him to be supervised by the probation service.

Jaji told the court: 'I'm not capable of doing something as despicable and heartless as this'

Jaji was unanimously convicted at the Old Bailey of raping the 11 year-old after the brave youngster gave evidence against him

Jaji attended a meeting with a 
probation officer as part of his ‘rehabilitation’ on the afternoon he 
raped the schoolgirl in Enfield, north London.

The apprentice chef was unanimously convicted of raping the 11-year-old and the judge, Mr Justice Singh, will now consider jailing him indefinitely to protect the public

Yesterday the Ministry of Justice 
ordered two investigations into the handling of Jaji’s case. The police,
 probation service, social services and other agencies who dealt with 
the teenager will be required to provide details of their involvement.

CCTV footage showed him watching the 
girl from the back of a bus as she chatted excitedly with a school 
friend. He then followed her off the bus as she waved goodbye to her 
friend and then dragged her into the park.

He denied the offence, forcing the little girl to give evidence at his trial.

She told the jury: ‘He said he was 
going to let me go but I couldn’t tell anyone or he would stab me. He 
said “I’m this close to killing you”.’

Jaji also threatened to film the rape and send copies to children at her school and ‘everyone she loved’.

At the trial, the girl’s father 
revealed his traumatised daughter came home and said: ‘I think I’ve been
 raped’. ‘As you can imagine, we were devastated by what she had said. I
 had my arm around her. She was shivering,’ he said.

The girl needed emergency surgery for severe injuries she sustained and was in hospital for two days.

Jaji was arrested two days later by a 
local Police Community Support Officer who realised that he matched the 
description given by the victim. Traces of his victim’s blood were found
 on his bag and trainers.

Jaji had been to a meeting with his probation officer just 90 minutes before the attack

When police raided his home they 
discovered adverts from parents looking for child-minders and details 
about apprenticeships in childcare.

Officers also found newspaper 
clippings about April Jones, the five-year-old girl who went missing 
from her home in Wales last October. Jaji, of Edmonton, north London, 
also used Facebook to reel in child victims from all over the world.

On his page, he wrote: ‘Warning. Dangerously sexy person owns this page.’

Yesterday he was accused of pleading 
not guilty, despite overwhelming evidence against him, so that he could 
force the girl to relive her ordeal by having to give evidence for his 
sexual gratification.

Andy Love, MP for Edmonton, said: ‘I’m
 shocked by the admissions that have come out since the guilty verdict. 
It’s amazing that this girl had to go through such a brutal and horrific
 attack when it was clear that this young man had quite a long history 
of deviant sexual behaviour.

‘Clearly we need a proper investigation into what happened. We need to know what sort of supervision he was under.

‘This young man was going seriously wrong. Why wasn’t that picked up?’

Sentencing is due to take place on June 7. Mr Justice Singh told the Old Bailey that a life sentence was an option.
