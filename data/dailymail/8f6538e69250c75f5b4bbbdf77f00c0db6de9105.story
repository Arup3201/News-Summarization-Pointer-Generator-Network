Joe Root and Angelo Mathews had to be kept apart by umpire Billy Bowden as the England batsman was taunted by Sri Lanka during day five at Headingley.

Root was barraged by fielders and given a torrid time by Sri Lanka captain Mathews, but the 23-year-old held up well under the pressure of those around him.

Root, having withstood the jeers coming in his direction, was eventually caught out for 31 after a thick edge from bowler Nuwan Pradeep.

Mahela Jayawardene, during Monday night's press conference, admitted England's batsmen would be targets on day five, and that proved to be the case.

It seems, unfortunately for Root, that he was chosen for the majority of their taunts as Sri Lanka tried to play the psychological game as the Test came to a close.
