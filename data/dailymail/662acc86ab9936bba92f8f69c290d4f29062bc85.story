A fugitive former bank boss is set to be stripped of assets worth more than £150million including an £18million mansion in one of London's most upmarket streets. 

Mukhtar Ablyazov, who fled Britain earlier this year after he was sentenced to 22-months in jail for failing to disclose full details about his wealth, is accused of defrauding one of Kazakhstan's largest banks while he was chairman in 2009.

Sitting at London's Court of Appeal yesterday, senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him.

Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is worth more than £63 
million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17 
million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row.

The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts.

He also has a £1m apartment in Albert 
Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre 
estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and 
helicopter pad.

Judges heard that Ablyazov, who is in his late 40s, had been a Kazakhstan government minister and chairman of a Kazakh bank.

He had been accused of defrauding the bank he used to run of more than £3billion.

Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says any allegations are politically motivated.

The JSC BTA Bank, now owned by the 
state of Kazakhstan, alleged 'widespread misappropriation' and had 
launched legal action in England in the hope of recovering as much as 
possible.

Missing: The former banker's whereabouts remain unknown and he was handed a 22-month sentence for contempt of court

In February, a High Court judge concluded that Ablyazov had been in contempt and imposed a 22-month jail term.

Mr Justice Teare said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded.

Ablyazov did not appear at the High Court hearing.

Mr Justice Teare issued a warrant - but the former banker's whereabouts remain unknown.Ablyazov today failed to overturn rulings by Mr Justice Teare in the Court of Appeal.

In May, a Court of Appeal judge ruled that Ablyazov could launch an appeal against Mr Justice Teare's rulings even though he was on the run.

Lord Justice Moore-Bick said 'it would not be in the interests of justice' to require Ablyazov to surrender to custody as a condition of proceeding with an appeal.

Three appeal judges - Lord Justice Maurice Kay, Lord Justice Rix and Lord Justice Toulson - heard argument from lawyers at an appeal hearing in London in July before dismissing Ablyazov's challenges in a written decision today.
