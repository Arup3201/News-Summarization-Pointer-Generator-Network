A 911 dispatcher, who hung up on a frantic man after he had just discovered his dead mother, has kept her job, it was revealed this week. 

An internal investigation by Las Vegas Fire and Rescue found that the female employee made critical failures but would not be fired. She faces 'corrective action' but what that actually means remains unclear.

The dispatcher, whose name has not been revealed by fire officials, took the call from a frantic man who sobbed that he had come home from work to find his mother dead.

A dispatcher who hung up on a frantic 911 caller at the Las Vegas Fire and Rescue department has kept her job, it was revealed this week

According to tapes from an 8 News NOW investigation, the caller told the dispatcher: 'Please, my mom. I just got off work, and I think my mom is dead.'

The operator tries to get the man's address but he is too distressed to give it to her. The dispatcher then brings a medical responder on the line which is part of the correct procedure.

The female employee again tries to confirm an address with the man so that she can send medical help. She asks the man to calm down, to which he hysterically responds: 'My mom's purple'!

The extremely distressed man continues to shout to which the 911 dispatcher snaps back: 'Ok, you don't have to holler at me, I didn't do it.'

The caller then says: 'F*** you b****.'

The operator then hangs up, yelling 'Bye!' down the line before she does.

Hanging up on a person who has called 911 for help is a serious violation of how the emergency service operates. 

Fire Chief Willie McDonald said that the employee had not been fired but that they were taking 'corrective' measures to make sure that a similar incident didn't happen again

Las Vegas Fire and Rescue Chief Willie McDonald told 8 News Now
 that several people identified the 911 dispatcher who handled the call from her voice.

However he would say little else as policy protects the employee and the 
outcome of the internal investigation. 

He added: 'I
 guess I couldn't say this will never happen again, but we clearly have 
taken the steps in this case to make sure the employee is really clear 
on what should have happened, and there might be some retraining that 
might be necessary.'

Around 600,000 calls are handled by the fire dispatch office each year.
