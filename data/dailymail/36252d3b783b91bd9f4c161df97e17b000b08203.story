Soccer mad: Rhiannon Conelly, 16, an Americas High School junior from El Paso, Texas forfeited the cash prize to go to Spain to meet the player

A soccer mad teenager gave up a prize of $10,000 to meet her idol, Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. — the Brazilian soccer player.

Rhiannon Conelly, 16, an Americas High School junior from El Paso, Texas is so in love with the beautiful game that she forfeited the cash prize for a chance to go to Spain to meet the player instead.

She won a contest sponsored by the Brazilian soft-drink firm Guaraná Antarctica and the goalie will travel to Spain next year to meet Neymar.

But her decision has not gone down well with her family and friends, who think that she should have taken the cash prize and forgotten all about meeting Neymar.

She told The El Paso Times: 'I just wanted to meet Neymar, I thought that was more important than the $10,000. Everyone disagrees with that, but I'm sticking to my guns.'

Today, she is looking forward to her  upcoming meeting in 2015.

'It feels good. I mean to go to Spain and meet your idol, it feels awesome.'

The teenager will take her mom and her coach along with her.

Her personal coach Gerardo Alvarez said he was happy to be included in the trip. 

He added that he had no doubt that Conelley would meet Neymar some day, it was only a matter of time.

'She's pretty good at what she does,' he said. 'The star was going to meet the rising star.' 

Neymar, the Brazilian soccer player is known among fans worldwide for his flamboyant hairstyles, fancy footwork and character - which dazzles followers of the Brazilian national soccer team.

At just 22-years-old, he is already ranked as one of the most interesting players to watch. 

Connelly said the forward has the potential to be like Lionel Messi and could even win a sixth World Cup championship for his team Brazil.

However, while she is certain that he is a brilliant player, she is still thinking of what things she will say to him when they meet face-to-face.

'I'll ask him if he wants to marry me,' she said jokingly.

Adding: 'I don't want to scare him too much, I don't want him to call security to kick me out.'

Connelly entered the competition  during the World Cup earlier this year. 

Organizers said that there were over 2,000 entries and 4,000 votes. 

The contest  required Neymar fans to submit their pictures.

Most were photographed in Brazilian regalia, and others were pictured with a football and they all had a Guaraná soft drink on hand. 

Conelley got her image in the back of the net when she submitted a photo in June featuring her wearing the Brazilian jersey, while doing 'dominadas' or soccer tricks.

The high school student will meet Neymar in July 2015 in Barcelona.
