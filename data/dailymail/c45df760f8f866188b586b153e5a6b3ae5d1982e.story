Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin was denounced by Tory MPs last night after he said the Government will not know how many Romanians and Bulgarians will emigrate to the UK – until after they have got here.

The row came after the gaffe-prone strategist was challenged over the likely impact of people in the EU member states gaining the right to live and work in Britain next year.

The two countries have a combined population of nearly  30 million and asked on BBC’s Any Questions? whether he agreed with one unofficial estimate that 50,000 would arrive each year, Mr Letwin said: ‘I don’t know.’

When pressed further,  he admitted the Government would know only after they had actually arrived. He went on: ‘Probably we will finally only know when we know what we see.’

But his confession sparked fury on the Tory backbenches. Priti Patel, MP for Witham, Essex, said: ‘It’s not good enough.

‘We need an urgent assessment of the likely impact of future immigration – not least to look at the effect on vital public services.’

Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, Northants, says the number of Bulgarians and Romanians in the UK could jump from 155,000 to 425,000.

He added: ‘I believe the Government does have estimates but is frightened to publish them because they would alarm the public.’
