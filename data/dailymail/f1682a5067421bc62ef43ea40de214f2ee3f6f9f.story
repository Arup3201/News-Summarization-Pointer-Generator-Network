Their wedding was so secret that the first most knew of it was when a solitary picture of the glamorous couple was released to a stunned public.

Now, these never before seen pictures, provide a tantalising glimpse into the lost weekend 13 years ago when John F Kennedy Jr married Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.

The candid shots, seen here for the first time, form part of a new documentary which offers a fascinating new insight into John F Kennedy Jr, his relationship with his bride and his sister and his tragically short marriage.

Everything to play for: John Jr and his best friend William 'Billy' Noonan relaxing on the eve of John Jr's secret wedding on Cumberland Island, off the coast of Georgia. Noonan was the last person to speak to John Jr

Speaking for the first time those closest to John Jr, then 35, and Carolyn, then 30, have recalled a young couple ‘madly in love,’ and filled with optimism on the eve of their marriage on 21 September 1996. 

They have revealed the poignant speech made by the groom at the rehearsal dinner and the hauntingly prophetic words of his uncle, Ted Kennedy, on the day itself.

Seen today, Ted Kennedy’s words seem to foreshadow the crash that claimed John Jr, Carolyn and her sister, Lauren, less than three years later when, in a storm on the night of 16 July 1999, the small plane John Jr was piloting plunged into the Atlantic off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard.

In ‘Coming Home with the Kennedys,’ 
filmmaker Daphne Barak was allowed unprecedented access to the family as
they made an emotional journey to Ireland, recreating in almost every 
aspect the historic trip made by JFK, 50 years after his assassination.

Laid back: John Jr pictured with his Uncle Ted's dog in his Manhattan apartment. John John as he was often known was charismatic and fun, easy and much missed company

JFK was the first American president of Irish ancestry to visit his homeland, travelling to New Ross, Co Wexford in June 1963.

The journey made by 35 of the Kennedy clan this June was intended, in part, to honour the promise to return that he could never fulfil. Four months after his visit JFK was shot dead in Dallas.

'Carolyn...You changed my life in a way I never knew was possible,'

During this recent  visit the family, led by JFK’s daughter, Caroline, 55, and her cousin Kathleen, 62, rededicated the Kennedy Homestead in New Ross, opened a visitor centre and lit the Emigrant Flame with a flame carried from the Eternal Flame that burns on JFK’s grave in Arlington.

Many times over, according to Barak, thoughts turned to the other ‘lost sons.’ She said: ‘You’d hear people say, “I wish John Jr was here.” Or they would comment on how much Caroline’s son Jack looks like him.’

Unfulfilled promise: John Jr at his mother's Manhattan home on the christening of a friend's baby. John had spoken to friends of his desire to start a family with Carolyn

The fact that Caroline 
and John Jr visited Ireland together as small children when, in 1966, 
Jackie took her children ‘home’ made John Jr’s presence all the more 
keenly felt.

John Jr’s charisma and sense of fun was often recalled during the June visit and those qualities shine out from these previously unseen pictures.

 'Even as a child his fate was on his head,'

Daphne Barak on John F Kennedy Jr

In a series of candid moments John Jr is shown messing around on the beach at Cumberland Island, the little known spit of land off the coast of Georgia.

Bare-chested and brimming with all the promise of his youth, John Jr, playfully holds his nanny  Marta in a bear hug as wedding guests enjoy a relaxed beach barbeque the day before the ceremony.

In another he poses with best friend William Noonan. They appear mismatched beach tennis partners as the athletic John Jr clutches a beach bat while the slightly portly Noonan grins by his side.

Out of sight: The Greyfield Inn on Cumberland Island, pictured on 23 September 1996 - two days after John Jr and Carolyn's wedding. Many wedding guest stayed here for the secret ceremony that caught the world by surprise

Noonan, 55, was the last person ever speak to John Jr. Now he reflects: ‘What’s most interesting about John is that everybody knew who he was but few people outside of his closest friends knew exactly what he was.’

The night before the wedding John Jr made a clumsy toast to his wife, giddy with love he muddled his dates as he addressed her: ‘Carolyn, I am looking forward to call you my wife on Sunday..’

The raucous wedding crowd yelled: ‘Not Sunday: Tomorrow! Saturday!’

John blushed before raising his glass and continuing: ‘To Carolyn…You changed my life in a way I never knew was possible.’

The following day it fell to his uncle Ted Kennedy to toast the couple following the evening ceremony in Cumberland Island’s tiny wood-frame church.

In words that, Barak said, now seem a chilly premonition he recalled a gift made to JFK by the Irish Ambassador on John Jr’s birth.

‘The Irish ambassador came and gave my brother after John was born a wonderful silver mug cup, from Wexford.

'At the time he read a poem that had been written by a friend in Ireland about HIS son, when his son was born.

‘And let me take a moment to read these lines…It was read to my brother Jack.

'”We wish to the new child…As the wind leaves as it passes over the grasses, after a summer shower….A heart than can recognize… the gifts that life holds for the wise..And when the storm breaks for him, may the tree shake for him…In the night that he is troubled, may the friends wait for him, so that his time be doubled. And at the end of all the loving and love, may the man above give him the crown.”’

Carolyn relaxes with Marta at her parents' home in Connecticut during the holiday season, while she visited them with John Jr. Marta has dismissed any notion that the Kennedy's did anything other than welcome Carolyn

Barak pointed out: ‘All the talk of storm and the night that he is troubled…John Jr’s plane went down on a stormy night when his friends were waiting for him at the other end of that journey.

‘To me it’s quite chilling that this poem was read to his father on his birth. It is as if even as a child his fate was on his head.’

'They never did anything without each other. Every decision. They were two but they were one,'

John Jr's nanny Marta on the bond between John Jr and sister Caroline

But before tragedy struck pictures of John Jr and his wife Carolyn, just 33 when she died, at home show a couple seemingly relaxed and happy together.

They are seen posing with John Jr’s nanny Marta and Jackie Onassis’s butler Daniel Efgenio in the kitchen, of what used to be Jackie’s Fifth Avenue home.

The same kitchen in which John Jr can be seen chatting animatedly to Bill and Hillary Clinton a few years earlier – according to Barak one of the first things Hillary did on Bill’s presidency was contact Jackie.

She said: ‘She asked her for lunch because she knew that Jackie had experience of raising young children in the White House and they had Chelsea. They became very good friends after that.’

But as scion of the Kennedy family and the founder of George magazine, John Jr’s public profile brought much to live up to and much to bear.

By the time of their death rumors of marital difficulties were rife.

There was talk of infidelity and drug abuse and the allegation Caroline Kennedy did not approve of John Jr’s bride and that the siblings had grown distant as a result.

Now, speaking to camera, John Jr and Caroline’s nanny, Marta, has dismissed these rumors as nonsense.  

She insisted that any ‘distance’ was simply the natural effect of two people marrying and leading more separate lives. 

There was no breakdown of relationship, she said. 

To the very end of John Jr’s life she said: ‘They never did anything without each other. Every decision. They were two but they were one.’‘Coming Home With The Kennedys’ will be released worldwide in November
