Boko Haram militants dressed as soldiers have slaughtered at least 200 civilians in Nigeria.

Witnesses said the extremists rounded up the helpless villagers promising to protect them - the same tactic used to kidnap 300 schoolgirls in April - before opening fire until almost all were dead.

Community leaders in the three northeastern villages claimed the military failed to intervene, even though it was warned an attack was imminent.

A community leader who witnessed the killings on Monday said residents of the Gwoza local government district, in Borno state, pleaded for the military to send soldiers to protect the area.

He said they had heard the Islamist militants - who have taken over several villages in Nigeria - were about to attack, but help didn't arrive.

After escaping the massacre and fleeing to Maiduguri, Borno's state capital, he said: 'We all thought they were the soldiers that we earlier reported to that the insurgents might attack us.'

'Then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead'

The militants arrived in Toyota Hilux pickup trucks - commonly used by the military - and told the civilians they were soldiers 'and we are here to protect you all'.

The tactic was the same used by Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 300 girls from a school in the town of Chibok on April 15, prompting an international campaign whose supporters include the U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama.

After people gathered in the village centres on the militants' orders, the witness said, 'they begin to shout `Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar' on top of their voices.

'Then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead.'

The witness asked not to be named for fear for his safety.

The killings happened on Monday in the villages of Danjara, Agapalwa, and Antagara.

They are in the Gwoza
 local government area, a regional political centre whose emir was killed in a
 Boko Haram ambush on his convoy last week.

Boko Haram's violence has forced more than 250,000 people to flee their homes since March last year, according to Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).

But a report yesterday warned the latest horrific attacks in the north east could still be the tip of the iceberg.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), based in Norway, said the unrest could spread rapidly to other countries.

Its director Alfredo Zamudio said: 'As the government struggles to contain the group’s southward spread towards Abuja, questions to the future of regional stability have been raised which have weakened Nigeria’s relations with Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

'The group is growing in its ambition, capability and reach, creating fears that it will become a regional destabilising force.'

Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, added: 'What we have learnt from past experiences of managing the humanitarian impact of armed groups, such as the LRA, is that speed is of the essence.

'The longer such groups are allowed to continue these horrific abuses, the more visibility and notoriety they gain, the harder it becomes to control their spread and impact - they must be stopped, and they must be stopped now'.

Emirs are religious and traditional rulers who have been targeted for speaking out against Boko Haram's extremism.

Borno governor Kashim Shettima traveled on Saturday to Gwoza to pay his respects 
to the fallen emir and was quoted as saying it was a terrifying ride.

'If
 I say I was not petrified travelling through that ... road to Gwoza I 
would be lying because that road had been designated a no-go area for 
about two months now due to the incessant attacks and killings that 
occur there,' the governor was quoted as saying by Information Nigeria.

A
 local journalist who was in the convoy - escorted by 150 soldiers - 
counted at least 16 towns and villages that were deserted along the 85 
mile route.

The slaughter was confirmed by both Mohammed Ali Ndume, a senator representing Borno and whose hometown is Gwoza, and by a top security official in Maiduguri who insisted on anonymity because he isn't allowed to speak to the media.

It took a few days for survivors to 
get word of the massacres to Maiduguri, the provincial capital, because 
travel on the roads is extremely dangerous and phone connections are 
poor or nonexistent.

The 
community leader wasn't shot because 'I was going round to inform people
 that the soldiers had come and they wanted to address us,' he said.

As people were fleeing, other gunmen lurking outside the villages on motorcycles mowed them down, he said.

Militants
 of Boko Haram, which wants to establish Islamic state in Nigeria, have 
been taking over villages in the northeast, killing and terrorizing 
civilians and political leaders.

The Islamic fighters are making a comeback from a year-long military offensive which had been aimed at crushing them.

Monday's attacks have been among the deadliest so far.

Thousands of people have been killed 
in the five-year-old insurgency, more than 2,000 so far just this year, 
and an estimated 750,000 Nigerians have been driven from their homes.

Nigeria's military has insisted that the big influx of troops and a year-old state of emergency in three states which gives them the power to detain suspects, take over buildings and lock down any area has the extremists on the run.

But while Boko Haram has mostly been pushed out of northeastern cities, militants have been seizing villages with thatched-roof huts in the semi-arid region where they once held sway.

Their black flags adorned with white Arabic lettering have been hoisted above simple village buildings, making vast parts of Nigeria no-go areas for the military.
