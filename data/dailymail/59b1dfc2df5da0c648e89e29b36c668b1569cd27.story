Vincent Tabak apologised yesterday for killing Joanna Yeates and putting her parents through ‘hell’.

Speaking at his murder trial for the first time, the 33-year-old insisted he had not meant to harm her and said the crime would haunt him for ever.

He claimed he tried to kiss Miss Yeates after she was ‘flirty’ with him, and strangled her in panic when she screamed.

Vincent Tabak, who is in the witness stand today, admits strangling his neighbour Jo Yeates but denies her murder. He broke down in the witness box while describing how he killed her

But his version of events was 
dismissed by the prosecution at Bristol Crown Court, who said he was a 
calculating, dishonest and manipulative man who wanted to have sex with 
the landscape architect and killed her when she resisted his advances.

His voice faltering, Tabak said Miss 
Yeates, his next-door neighbour in Clifton, Bristol, had waved and 
invited him in when she saw him walking past her kitchen window on 
December 17.

He said they talked about how neither of their partners was at home that evening.

He added: ‘We talked about her cat 
that had come into our flat once. She made some flirty comment that the 
cat “went into places he shouldn’t go – a bit like [her]”.’

At this, Tabak decided to ‘make a pass’ at 25-year-old Miss Yeates and said he ‘got the impression she wanted to kiss me’.

He continued: ‘I leaned forward and I 
think I put one of my hands on her back and tried to kiss her. She 
started to scream quite loudly. I panicked and put one of my hands over 
her mouth. I said something like, “I’m sorry, it’s ok, please stop”.’

Taking deep breaths and gripping the 
sides of the witness stand, Tabak said he pulled his hand away from her 
mouth, and Miss Yeates let out another piercing scream.

Vincent Tabak considered throwing himself off a bridge after strangling Joanna Yeates, he told jurors.

Tabak, 33, broke down in tears as he said he thought twice about killing himself.

The 6ft 4in defendant told Bristol Crown Court:

'The first time was when I was in Cambridge and I think that was that day or the day after Joanna's body was found and it put me in a state of total despair and I didn't know what to do...'

After pausing and composing himself, he added: 'But I just clung on and decided not to do anything.'

His suicidal thoughts continued, the court heard.

Tabak added: 'After we were back in Bristol, now staying with a friend of Tanja's (Tanja Morson) I remember reading in one of the newspapers that they (the police) had found DNA, a sample of the DNA found on Joanna's body, and I thought "that's it".'

Recalling his feelings before his arrest, he said: 'I remember drinking serious amounts of alcohol... and (thinking of) jumping off the bridge.'

The Dutchman put one hand back over her mouth and the other hand around her neck.

Asked by his lawyer, William Clegg QC,
to close his eyes and relive the incident, he estimated that he had 
Miss Yeates in his grip for 15 seconds before her body ‘went limp’ and 
she fell to the floor. Mr Clegg asked if he had meant to kill her or 
cause her serious harm.

‘No, definitely not,’ replied Tabak, claiming he wanted to calm her down and stop the screaming.

Miss Yeates’s parents, brother and 
boyfriend Greg Reardon listened intently as Tabak said: ‘I am really 
sorry for being responsible for her death and I am sorry for putting her
parents and Greg through a week of hell, not knowing where she was.’

Removing his glasses and wiping a tear
from his eye, he went on: ‘I still can’t believe that I am capable of 
such an act – it will haunt me for the rest of my life, no matter what 
sentence I get.’

Tabak also told the court: ‘I should 
have called the police the moment she was dead. I had ample opportunity 
to call the police and I didn’t do it.’ He said he twice felt suicidal 
in the weeks after the killing and tried to carry on as normal despite 
expecting to be arrested ‘any day, any moment’.

But prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said 
Tabak was a ‘calculating, dishonest, and manipulative’ person, before, 
during and after the killing.

He accused Tabak of driving to an Asda
supermarket so that he would appear on its CCTV cameras around the time
of Miss Yeates’s death, and said he texted his girlfriend from there as
another way of placing him at a distance from Miss Yeates’s flat.

Mr Lickley also suggested Tabak found his neighbour attractive and wanted to have sex with her.

He asked: ‘Had you pulled her top up? Had you touched her breast? Is that what made her scream?’

Tabak shook his head and said: ‘Definitely not.’

Referring to the ‘panic’ the defendant
said he felt when he moved to stop Miss Yeates from screaming out, Mr 
Lickley told him: ‘You were thinking perfectly straight, Vincent Tabak. 
That woman was in pain as a result of what you were doing to her throat 
and you knew it. She was struggling to breathe. You just concentrated on
maintaining your grip on her throat.

‘That young woman was resisting you, Vincent Tabak, but you were not going to let her get away.’

Tabak admits the manslaughter of Miss Yeates but denies murder. The trial continues.

Mr Lickley said: 'We heard for the first time yesterday that this case had a sexual element to it.

'We heard yesterday that you went to kiss Miss Yeates. That is sexual contact.'

Tabak replied: 'I don't agree.'

Mr Lickley said: 'You were, in fact, thinking of more... having kisses and kisses and kisses... thinking of having sex with Joanna Yeates.'

Tabak replied: 'No, I wasn't.'

He said he made a pass at Miss Yeates after she offered him a drink, which he declined.

'Then we chatted a bit more and then I made the pass at her,' Tabak told jurors.

'We were standing quite close and I leaned forward.

'I leaned forward and tried to put my hand behind her back. She started to scream.'

Mr Lickley interjected: 'That must have been quite a surprise.

'So your reaction to that is placing your hand over her mouth... to stop her screaming.'

Tabak said: 'Yes, and trying to calm her down. I was trying to prevent her from screaming, saying I was sorry, "Stop, I am sorry".'

Mr Lickley asked Tabak a series of questions about what he did next and Tabak kept replying 'Can't remember'.

'Did you see in her eyes that she was frightened?' Mr Lickley asked.

'I can't remember,' Tabak replied.

The prosecutor asked: 'All you had to do, Vincent Tabak, was walk out of the flat?'

Tabak replied, after a pause: "Yes... I didn't.'

Mr Lickley went on to ask Tabak about what happened when he began to strangle Miss Yeates.

'She was fighting, was she not? She was fighting, she was struggling.

'Grabbing her arms, causing those bruises, pushing her hard against a rough surface, causing those injuries we will look at in a moment.

'But you were not going to let her get away, correct?

'You were not going to let her get away, so you carried on squeezing her throat.'

Tabak replied: 'I was not considering her getting away. I was not thinking straight... I was panicking.'
