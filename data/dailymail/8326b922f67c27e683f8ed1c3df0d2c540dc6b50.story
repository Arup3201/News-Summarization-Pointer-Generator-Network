Mitch Winehouse has revealed he has moved into his late daughter Amy's London apartment - because he can't bear to let it go.

As the star was celebrated at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala in Manhattan last night, her still grieving father told MailOnline: 'One thing we can’t let go of is Amy’s apartment in Camden...She loved that flat, and we live there now. '

And despite selling Amy's North London house for $2.89 million (£1.9 million) in December - Mitch admitted all the cash from the sale had gone to pay off legal fees and debts.

Tragic: Amy Winehouse died aged 27 in July 2011. Her father Mitch says he's still living in her London apartment.

Remembering Amy: The singer's parents Mitch and Janis Winehouse joined the legendary Tony Bennett at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala on Thursday night at the Waldorf Astoria Starlight Room in New York.

Amy, who died aged 27 in July 2011, lived in her small Camden apartment while recording her number one album Back to Black.

And
Mich, 60, said: 'When Amy was running out of money before Back to Black
came out, I said, “Amy, we’re going to have to sell the flat’, she told
me: “Never sell the flat, Dad. I’m going to bring out a new album, and 
we’re going to make millions.” So I thought we’d hold onto it for 
another three or four months.

'She loved that flat, and we [with his wife Jane] live there now.'

Memories: Amy Winehouse's house in Camden, North London. It was sold in December for $2.8 million.

Mitch
- who turned up to the event at the Waldorf Astoria hotel wearing a waistcoat emblazoned with his daughter's 
picture on the back - said the family had found it extremely hard to 
sell her house, where she died.

He
said: 'Anything linked with Amy is very hard to get rid of, but it was 
an incredible drain on our resources. We had to have a lot of security 
there, and it cost us an absolute fortune.'

The
house - which became a shrine for the late singer and drew fans from 
around the world following her death - was sold at auction for less than
$1.5 million  (£1million) less than the asking price.

It
was originally on the market for $4.2 million (£2.8 million) and Mitch 
said the family had made no money from the sale, revealing it had been 
spent on legal fees and debts, adding: ‘It’s all gone, to be honest’.

Amy's mother Janis, speaking at the gala, which was attended by stars including Jennifer Hudson and Mark Ronson, said she was still struggling with her daughter's loss.

Janis, 57, suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and said: 'It’s been quite a tough trip so far.

'The thing that has helped us through the last 18 months or so is knowing that she’s always here – she’s always, always here with us.

‘The family has never been so close. We were always close, but losing Amy has really brought us closer.’

With the marriage of Amy's older brother Alex to Riva Lefton in November 2011, Janis said she is hoping for grandchildren, but said: 'We'll have to wait and see.'

Tender: Mitch Winehouse and his ex-wife Janis share a kiss - while Mitch, joined by wife Jane, pays tribute to his daughter Amy with a picture of the star emblazoned on the back of his waiscoat.

Petite: Mitch Winehouse shows off one of his daughter's 1950s-inspired tiny dresses that the late star wore while performing.

Mitch said that instead of worrying about coping with the second anniversary of Amy's death, he and his ex-wife instead plan to celebrate what would have been her 30th birthday on September 14, adding: 'We're focusing on that. We're planning all sorts of things in London for Amy's birthday - there will be lots of events.

'There will also be a statue unveiled at the Roundhouse – subject to planning permission. The sculptor, Scott Eaton, is commissioned, so fingers crossed.’

The evening was made all the more emotional as Tony Bennett was honoured at the gala with the Foundation's Lifetime Achievement award.

'It’s been quite a tough trip so far...The
thing that has helped us through the last 18 months or so is knowing 
that she’s always here – she’s always, always here with us'

The legendary crooner, 86, recorded what turned out to be Amy's last recording, a cover of the jazz standard, Body and Soul, which went on to win a Grammy.

And Mitch said: ‘When Amy won all of her Grammys in 2008, it was Tony Bennett who uttered the immortal words: “And the winner is, Miss Amy Winehouse”. And she said: “Dad, I can’t believe that Tony Bennett knows my name, and that he knows who I am.”

And when she was asked to do the duet with Tony, she was so excited. I asked her what she was going to sing, and she said: “I’ve chosen Body and Soul, because it’s your favourite”.

I said: “Do you know the words love?” She said: “Dad, you’ve been singing it to me for 25 years – of course I know the words."

Brushing away tears, Mitch added: '‘You’ve only got to watch the video of them performing together to see the wonderful relationship they had in such a short space of time.

'After Amy passed away, I didn’t know how I was going to survive. The thing that saved me the most was that on that Sunday afternoon, Tony called me and spent an hour on the phone with me. I couldn’t believe that someone like Tony Bennett would do that for someone like me – and it just showed how much he loved and appreciated Amy.’

White hot: Jennifer Hudson showed off her curves in a figure-hugging white dress as she attended the first annual Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala at The Waldorf Astoria in New York City on Thursday

Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson was also honoured at the event and looked stunning as she took the stage to perform And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going and The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face.

Jennifer, 31, called the event 'beautiful' and called Amy 'such a talent, such a gift.'

Before Amy died from alcohol poisoning, , she had avoided drugs for two years and nine months, her father said. The foundation, founded in England just weeks after her death in 2011, steers young musicians from engaging in such abuse.

Mitch revealed the Foundation will start helping youngsters in the U.S. - joking about a telegram of support from New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, jibing: 'Thank you to Mayor Bloomberg for that wonderful dedication. It would have been better if you had sent $10 million or something, but thank you.’

He added: ‘Amy Winehouse created the Amy Winehouse Foundation long before it was called the Amy Winehouse Foundation.

'She was the one who took a homeless young person into her home; she was the one who made me fly to St Lucia with a suitcase full of money to pay for a stranger to have an operation on his hernia – someone she’d just met. She was the one who sold all of her dresses and gave the money to charity.

'She started this long before we did – she was a very charitable and loving young lady.'

Tony Bennett also paid tribute to the star, saying she lived a complete life because she was able to achieve her 
goal: becoming a respected musician.

'Her 
dream was to become famous and a beautiful singer and she accomplished 
that,' he said.

'Even though she had a 
short life, she had a great life because she ended up praying for the 
success that she wanted and it happened. This is what this night's 
about.'

Harry Belafonte presented the award to Bennett, and even said Bennett introduced him to Amy's music.

Kind words: The former American Idol star called the event 'beautiful' and said Winehouse was 'such a talent, such a gift'

Meanwhile, producer and musician Mark Ronson, who was accompanied by his mother Ann Dexter Jones, told MailOnline: ‘When Mitch or Janis or anyone from the family asks me to come out, I always say yes.'

Mark, 37, produced Amy's hit record Back to Black, and said: 'We recorded all the stuff we did on Black to Black here in New York. All the stuff with the band was in Brooklyn and then the vocals were done at a studio downtown that isn’t there any more.

'I first met Amy in New York – this is where we started our friendship, so it’s very relevant to have this event here tonight.

'It is quite ambitious to spread the Foundation’s work across the US, including the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, but it makes sense – so much of what Amy loved came from American jazz and soul music in America.’

Salaam Remi, who met Amy when she was 18 and produced much of Frank and Back to Black was also honoured.

He said: 'She was truly the driving force of her creative process," Remi told Rolling Stone after the gala. "She would sing one or two takes, top to bottom – no punches, no Auto-Tune, no tricks.'
