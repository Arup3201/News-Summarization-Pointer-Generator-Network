Amazon added more than 10 million new members to its Prime shipping and digital content service over the holidays, the retail giant has revealed.

It also revealed it plans to  offer one-hour shipping to more cities in 2015 after launching the service in Manhattan last week.

The firm also said Disney's Frozen Sparkle Princess Elsa Doll was its bestselling toy, followed by the Anki Drive Starter Kit Smart Robot Car Racing Game.

The new speedy delivery option was available to people in some parts of Manhattan who subscribe to Amazon Prime service, which carries an annual membership fee of $99.

Prime Now delivery  items can be ordered using Amazon applications on mobile devices powered by Apple or Android software.

There are over 25,000 items that are eligible for Prime Now. 

The Internet retailer has never disclosed the precise number of Prime subscribers, except to say it is in the tens of millions.

Amazon considers its $99-a-year Prime membership, which confers free two-day shipping and streaming of select movies and songs, essential to driving its growth and margins. 

It was unclear, however, how many of the 10 million new members were just taking advantage of a standing 30-day free trial offer.

Analysts estimate it is growing at a rapid clip, and the company continues to try and spice it up with new content.

The company's shares climbed 2.07 percent to $309.31 in midday Nasdaq trading.

Amazon said customers ordered more than 10 times as many items via same-day delivery this holiday season, compared with a year earlier. 

It did not reveal figures for Prime Now, the novel one-hour delivery option unveiled for parts of New York City's Manhattan borough just this month.

'We are working hard to make Prime even better and expanding the recently launched Prime Now to additional cities in 2015,' CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Amazon also said nearly 60 percent of its customers shopped via a mobile device this holiday, and total holiday sales through its smartphone app doubled this year. 

That may reflect 'showrooming,' when customers browse physical stores but make their purchases online.

'Mobile continues to accelerate the secular shift from offline to online purchases,' said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. 'Consumer use-cases for last-minute shopping, in-store purchases and price comparison continue to expand.'

'There are times when you can't make it to the store and other times when you simply don't want to go,' Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark said in a release.

'There are so many reasons to skip the trip and now Prime members in Manhattan can get the items they need delivered in an hour or less.'

One-hour delivery comes with a charge of $7.99, while two-hour delivery is free with purchases, according to Amazon.

Prime Now will be expanded in New York and rolled out in more cities next year, Clark said.

Quickly sating desires of online shoppers has become a point of competition, with Google and a growing array of major retailers offering fast delivery. 

Car-sharing startup Uber is reportedly toying with the idea of drivers efficiently shuttling purchases to people.

Amazon has been investing heavily in its distribution network and is even experimenting with using aerial drones to make deliveries.

Prime Now is available in New York from 6:00 am to midnight daily, with Amazon's facility on 34th Street in Manhattan serving as a hub for deliveries.

The Seattle-based company tested the service for the last few weeks using bike messengers working out of the building. 

Amazon Prime membership in the United States comes with free two-day shipping as well as access to streaming films, television shows and music.
