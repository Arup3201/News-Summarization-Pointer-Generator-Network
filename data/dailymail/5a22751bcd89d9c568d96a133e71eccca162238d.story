A chip shop owner has removed a ‘racist’ banner boasting that the business now had ‘English owners’, after his predecessor received threats to burn it down.

Previous owner Paul Bradbury - who put the sign up at the Chippy on the Green in Padiham, Lancashire, after taking it over last August - has gone back to Liverpool with his wife Rachel after shutting up shop.

The couple had put a banner outside which said ‘Under new management with English owners’ - but Mr Bradbury said that he received two threatening phone calls from people calling him racist.

They left the shop and moved away from the area earlier this year - and new owner Sotos Orfanides has now adapted the sign to read ‘Under new management with English meals’.

Mr Orfanides, who is originally from Cyprus and also owns a Greek restaurant in Liverpool, had previously been renting the Chippy on the Green to Mr and Mrs Bradbury.

He said: ‘I don’t think the original sign was racist, but there was a big thing about it being racist. No one is racist in this shop. They were English and they were serving some English food.

‘I changed the sign because people were calling and threatening to burn the shop down. I care about the business, so I changed it. Paul and Rachel went back to Liverpool because of the threats. They weren’t racist.’

The shop had previously been run by 
English people of East Asian and of Greek descent. It used to sell 
English and Chinese food, kebabs and pizza under Mr and Mrs Bradbury but
 is now going to mainly sell fish and chips.

A
 Lancashire Police spokesman said at the time of the threats: ‘Police 
officers from the Padiham neighbourhood team went to the shop after 
becoming aware of the threats.

‘The owner told officers he did not want to pursue the matter and so we can’t take any further action.’

The shop was reopened last week after a refurbishment and is being managed by one of Mr Orfanides’s relatives.

Mr
 Bradbury’s story was featured in MailOnline last August, and he said: 
‘I’m not racist. Anyone who thinks I’m a bigot is narrow-minded.

‘People
 want to know they are going to be served by somebody English. People 
have said to us that they are glad somebody English is serving them and 
that the sign made them want to come in.

‘They’ve never had anyone in the shop before. We are advertising that we are English.

'You wouldn’t want your fish and chips served to you by someone Turkish, or from wherever, because it wouldn’t be as good a recipe as it would be from somebody English.

'I changed the sign because people were calling and threatening to burn the shop down. I care about the business, so I changed it'

Sotos Orfanides, new owner

‘It doesn’t matter what colour or race you are, we’ll serve you. We welcome everyone here. I won’t be taking the sign down.

'We don’t want to upset anyone and we aren’t racist. We wouldn’t be serving foreign food if we were racist.’

Gordon Birtwistle, Liberal Democrat MP for Burnley, said: ‘They are now advertising what the shop sells. I’m not interested in who is selling the food, just what they are selling.’
