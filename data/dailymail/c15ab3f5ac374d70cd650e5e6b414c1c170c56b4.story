A list of the worst mobile phone apps for extracting personal information such as location and contacts has been compiled by academics.

Among the worst for taking details from users who have little or no idea it is happening include Angry Birds and Brightest Flashlight.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh in the US, looked at the most popular programs in Google's Android app store to compile their list.

Researchers found that users often have little idea their apps take details such as location.

Some of the apps, such as Google Maps, were at least half expected by mobile users to be taking location details but others were more of a surprise.

When told that the Angry Birds mobile app took location details, 80 per cent of users questioned were surprised.

Dr Jason Hong, of the university’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, wrote on a blog: "A vast majority of people (95%) were surprised that Brightest Flashlight used location data, but no one (0%) was surprised that Google Maps did so.

'Here, we can use level of surprise as one form of privacy. If people aren't surprised, then from our perspective it's less of a privacy issue, since people have some level of informed consent.

'On the other hand, if lots of people are surprised, then we have a potential privacy issue at hand.'

The list, which was not ranked in any order, was released after Dr Hong and colleague including Professor Norman Sadeh analysed the 100 most popular Android apps.

The other eight apps were Toss It game, Talking Tom virtual pet, Backgrounds HD Wallpapers, Dictionary.com, Mouse Trap game, Horoscope, Shazam music, and Pandora Internet Radio.

One or more of three types of information - location, device identifying details, and contact lists - were collected, the researchers found.

Users were often in the dark as to why the information was collected by the app, such as 58 per cent being unaware device IDs could be used for marketing.

Dr Hong said users would be far less suspicious if they were to be told why the information is being extracted as there can be good reasons for it.

The mobile Angry Birds app was among those named by researchers.

Backgrounds HD Wallpapers takes contact details because because it has a facility to change the appearance of the screen when one of the contacts rings or texts.

He said it is important that the apps are transparent about what they take and why.

He added: 'Some of these uses, while rated unusual, were actually perceived as legitimate once it was explained how the data was used.

'For example, the Dictionary.com app uses location for finding words that others near you are searching for, rather than for ads or other purposes.

'In our work, we also found that people were generally ok with this usage once it was made clear to them.

'In the short-term, the main thrust of our research is to help people understand these kinds of unusual behaviors of apps, as well as increase transparency.

'It's worth pointing out too that a lot of this information seems to be used for advertising rather than malicious purposes (though it obviously depends on your definition of malicious).

'In the long-term, we need better policies and best practices around this kind of data collection, as well as better ways of helping developers create sustainable business models that also respect privacy.

Professor Sadeh was quoted by NBCNEWS.com as saying: ‘When you look at the fundamental issue, it's about informing users and giving them an option.

‘You need to say more to users than, “I need permission to collect this.” You need to tell them what you will do with what you collect. When you communicate, you put people at ease.’

But he added: ‘The platforms invite developers to collect more information than you would like.

‘And the developers can hide behind what the app store offers (for disclosure options).

'They can say, “Hey, there's no way for me to offer more.” It's up to these marketplaces to make an effort to convey more information.’
