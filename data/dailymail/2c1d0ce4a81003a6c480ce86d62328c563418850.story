Britain is set to bask in several days of warm weather as temperatures in September continue to sizzle well above the national average.

While temperatures are expected to hover between 24-25C (75-77F) today, they may hit 27C (80F) tomorrow in the south east, but will at least reach 26C (78F).

According to Met Office statistics, that's 7C (44F) higher than the September average of 17.9C (64.2F).

While the skies were relatively cloudy today, the temperatures were still in their mid-20s, which saw a lucky few sitting in the sun at Sidmouth, Devon

While temperatures are expected to reach 26C (78F) tomorrow and remain steady throughout the weekend, forecasters said it would remain cloudy and there would be some brief, but heavy, downpours

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: '26C is fairly well above average for this time of year.'

Mr Williams said temperatures could reach 26C on Friday and would remain around 24-25C throughout the weekend, but over the next two days there would be 'quite a lot of clouds around... it is not wall to wall sunshine'.

He said those daring to sunbathe should also expect brief, but heavy, downpours on Thursday and Friday, especially in the south west.

It has been predicted that the sunny weather will boost the turnout for tomorrow's Scottish independence referendum.

Mr Williams said the sunny spell was caused by a low pressure system off the north-western tip of Spain which was pulling air across the continent. The showers were due to the moisture being absorbed along the way.

Mr Williams said it was too early to predict what the weather would do for the remainder of the month, but said temperatures should remain steady into next week, although they would vary across the country.

Mr Williams said: 'We will probably see a north-south split, with unsettled weather in the north, while the south will cling to more dry spells.'

Sunny September is also on record to become one of the driest ever recorded.

Figures up to Monday show there had been 6.7mm of rain across the UK - just seven per cent of the September average of 96mm.

The Met Office said they would normally expect about half of the average monthly rainfall to have fallen by this point in the month.

It said the figures make it the driest first half of September for the UK since 1960.

It’s also the driest start to September for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not for England – 1997 and 2003 were drier - the Met Office said.

By individual country, Wales was the driest with less than 1mm of rain up until Monday, followed by Northern Ireland which had 1.2mm. England received 4.1mm and Scotland 13.5mm.

The average temperature for the UK this month, until the 15th, has been 13.9C (57F), which is 1.3C (34F) above the full-month average.

Day-time maximums have averaged 18.4C (65F) which is 1.9C (35F) higher than normal.

Night-time minimums have been closer to average at 9.6C (49F), which is 0.7C (33F) above average.

Sunshine has also been slightly above normal with 70.8 hours for the UK - about 57 per cent of the full-month average.

The figures have come about after a prolonged spell of settled and fine weather, dominated by high pressure sitting over the UK, forecasters said.
