Young children on a bouncy castle clung on for their lives as it was lifted by strong winds and flew 100 yards through the air at a car boot sale yesterday.

Several other youngsters were bounced straight off before it was carried by the 40mph gust over stalls, cars and onlookers, landing upside down against a vehicle.

Five people were taken to hospital after the giant inflatable blew away.

Shocked: Onlookers at the Ripley Car Boot Sale, held at Ripley Cricket Club near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, watched in horror as the inflatable was carried away by the wind and blown over a number stalls

Probe: North Yorkshire Police officers are investigating and the Health and Safety Executive was informed

The injured are believed to include two children under five.

Witness Carmen Williams said: ‘I was 
in the cafe and in a flash the bouncy castle with two or three children 
on it just flew over.

‘People were screaming and running away from it. It was awful.’

She said one of the injured was an elderly woman who was hit on the head by the inflatable.

The accident happened at 10.05am at Ripley Cricket Club, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Several children were on the combined
inflatable slide and bouncy castle, which was tethered to the ground, 
when it broke free from its moorings.

High winds: Five people were taken to Harrogate District Hospital and another to Leeds General Infirmary

Shocking scene: Witness Katie Lister said she heard screaming before the large inflatable blew into the air

Leanne Forde, 24, a veterinary 
surgeon, said: ‘I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. All of a sudden 
the slide blew over and was being blown across the field.

‘It was really busy and there were people trying to run out of its path.

‘I could hear people screaming and stalls were being knocked over.

‘There were kids playing on the slide at the time.

‘The slide was really high so if a 
child had been standing at the top when it blew over I dread to think 
what could have happened.

‘It only stopped blowing across the field when it got stuck against a vehicle.’

'We
heard screaming and then the bouncy castle just blew into the air. 
There were no children on it at the time, but it did land on a crowd of 
people'

Witness Katie Lister, 41

Another witness said: ‘Some kids 
going down the slide side of it got bounced straight off. The castle 
continued rolling over a lot of people and a few stalls.’ Katie Lister, 
41, said: ‘We heard screaming and then the bouncy castle just blew into 
the air.’

She said she saw the inflatable ‘land on a crowd of people, including children, parents and grandparents’.

Witnesses said one elderly woman received a neck injury.

Five ambulances were sent to the 
scene. Four of the injured were taken to Harrogate District Hospital, 
while one was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary with chest pains.

One patient was kept in hospital 
overnight but none were seriously injured. Hundreds of people were at 
the event on the Ripley Castle estate. A castle spokesman said: ‘Our 
sympathy to all those affected this morning. Hope those injured make a 
swift recovery.’

Police have impounded the inflatable 
and the Health and Safety Executive has begun an investigation. PC David
Lever, of North Yorkshire Police, said: ‘Most of the injuries occurred 
when the slide was being blown across the field. We know it hit several 
people in its path, as well as knocking stalls over and hitting 
vehicles.

‘Those who were injured are being treated in hospital and one is expected to be kept in hospital overnight.

‘It is a blessing that none of the injuries are serious.’

A similar accident led to the deaths 
of two women in 2006, when an inflatable artwork called Dreamspace V 
broke free from its guy ropes in Chester Le Street, County Durham.

Its creator, Maurice Agis, was fined £10,000 and Chester Le Street council fined £20,000 for breaching safety regulations.
