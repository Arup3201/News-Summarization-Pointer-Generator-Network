Darren Fletcher's 20-year association with Manchester United came to end on Monday, when he joined West Brom on a three-and-a-half year deal.

During his 342 appearances for the club, the midfielder's honours include four Premier League titles and a Champions League triumph.

It's safe to say the 31-year-old's displays on-and-off the pitch have cemented his place in the hearts of the Old Trafford faithful but United blogger, and www.90min.com contributer, Scott Saunders discusses why the timing of the Scotland international's departure is  correct for both the player and the club.

Football can be an unforgiving business, especially at the world's top clubs. That's exactly how it is at Manchester United.

Times change, people change, teams evolve and priorities alter. And the latest case in point came when it was confirmed Darren Fletcher was leaving United for West Bromwich Albion, in one of the final deals of transfer deadline day. The move closed the book on a storied United career for the Scot - one lined with triumphs, adversity and uncertainty. He spent 20 years of not only his career, but his life, connected with the club.

The Scot will always remain a favourite with United's supporters after growing up, and growing older under their watchful eye, but for all parties, there's little getting away from the fact that his decision to leave was the right one. United manager Louis van Gaal, as well as the player himself, deserve a huge amount of credit for having the foresight to make the deal happen.

Like it or not - and yes, they have spent nearly £200m over the last year - United are still a team in transition. Big money has been spent, but the operation is far from complete. This procedure involves as many outgoings as incomings.

It's been glaringly obvious that United have needed a clear out for a number of years. Sir Alex Ferguson failed to sift through the hordes of players at his disposal in his final days with the club - and David Moyes baulked at the idea too - but Van Gaal is not shying away. While a host of players left last summer, other dead wood like £26m flop Anderson was thrown out this winter.

That's not to say Fletcher is 'dead wood' - in fact, it'd be extremely harsh to suggest.

The newly-turned 31-year-old had plenty to offer for the rest of this season. Boasting a number of Premier League winners' medals, great leadership skills and unmatched determination, Fletcher could have taught some of the new crop a thing or two. And that hunger to play was only increased after his long battle with ulcerative colitis put him on the shelf for around two years. His desire to play though could not be fulfilled at his boyhood club any longer. Van Gaal conceded he didn't want to let Fletcher leave, but with an expiring contract at the end of June and a number of competitors for his spot in the team, Fletcher did not want to waste any more time.

And he's made it happen. For him, regular Premier League football beckons once more.

While Fletcher's departure may mean that United lose a small part of their identity, it’s probably the right decision and it’s what's best for the player. The rebuild at United can continue and Fletcher can continue his career.
