The husband of a well-respected doctor and mother who died from cyanide poisoning has been charged with lacing his wife's drink with the deadly substance. 

Husband Dr. Robert Ferrante, 64, allegedly
killed his wife by mixing cyanide with an energy drink called creatine, which he told her would help them to conceive
another child.

Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her
Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, 
where she also headed the women's neurology department.

Ferrante told authorities and his wife's family that she had suffered a stroke, but investigators found her body had more than 30 times the lethal level of cyanide in her system.

His attorney says his client wasn't fleeing police when he left Florida - he was simply driving back to Pennsylvania to surrender.

Instead, West Virginia State Police stopped 64-year-old Dr. Robert Ferrante on Thursday night.

He's being held in that state until he can be extradited to Pennsylvania to face a charge of criminal homicide in the death of his wife.

The extradition process is expected to take a few days.

It was previously revealed that Ferrante, who is a medical expert at the University of Pittsburgh, used his work credit card to purchase cyanide just two days before his wife's death.

Ferrante's attorney Bill Difenderfer told KDKA that his client uses cyanide as part of his job as a professor at the university.

Sources close to the investigation said Dr. Ferrante
appeared to be devastated by his loss and maintains his innocence, 
however he was unwilling to speak to KDKA when they approached him.

The couple have a six-year-old daughter called Cianna.

As well as heading the women's neurology department at UPMC, Klein was a mother to six-year-old Cianna

Dr. Ferrante called 911 and reported that his wife had a heart attack on April 20th.

Sources say 'extremely high levels of
cyanide' were found in Dr. Klein’s blood.

The type of levels that would
have 'knocked her to the floor' in 30 seconds sources say.

Colleagues were in shock at the loss of the
young and valued colleague who had quickly become an 
acknowledged leader in treating pregnant women suffering 
neurological diseases.

'This is an irreplaceable loss,' said
Robert Friedlander, chairman of neurological surgery at UPMC, who 
recruited Dr. Klein in 2011.

Lawrence
Wechsler, chairman of the neurology department at UPMC, added: 'Autumn 
was a pioneer as well as a caring doctor, wonderful teacher, researcher 
and mentor.’

She moved to Pittsburgh with her 
husband, Robert Ferrante, a leading researcher in ALS and 
Huntington's disease from Harvard Medical School, who was also recruited by 
Friedlander to become a Pitt professor of neurological surgery.

The
victim’s mother Cook Klein, 79, had been due to fly to Pennsylvania from her
home in Towson,

Maryland to babysit for her daughter she her son-in-law
broke the news that Autumn had been rushed to hospital.

Initially she was told her daughter may 
have suffered a stroke.

When she heard about the cyanide, her first 
concern was for her granddaughter and who would pick her up from school if 
police needed to speak to her father.

Police told her that Cianna was with her father.

Paying tribute to her daughter, Cook Klein described her as a ‘wonderful human being and a fantastic mother’

‘I don't know of anybody that would have a reason to try to hurt her,’ she said.

In addition to her husband, daughter and mom, Autumn is survived by her father William Klein; a stepdaughter, Kimberly Ferrante of San Diego; and a stepson, Michael Ferrante of Boston.
