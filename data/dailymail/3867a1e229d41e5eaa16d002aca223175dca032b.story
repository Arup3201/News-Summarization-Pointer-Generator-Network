Dirk Kuyt has hailed former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard as the best player he has ever played with.

The 34-year-old  forward spent six years at Anfield having joined from Feyenoord in 2006.

The Dutchman moved on to Fenerbahce in 2012 after more than 200 appearances for the Anfield side, and he was full of praise for the Liverpool captain.

Kuyt was supposed to be part of a Liverpool charity match between a Jamie Carragher XI and a Gerrard XI but has pulled out due to injury. 

He told The Sun: 'I have had time on the pitch with some greats - Luis Suarez, Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Fernando Torres. All fantastic players but for me Gerrard was the best of them all.

'Steven saw I would do everything for my team. In my first season there I played as a second striker and scored 14. But the next year we signed Tores and I moved out to the right. I did that without any problems and Steven liked that.

Gerrard will leave Liverpool this summer to join MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy after spending his entire career at Anfield.
