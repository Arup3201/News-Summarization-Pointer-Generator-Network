This was the moment one disgusted customer was put off dining at Pizza Hut for good after photographing a mouse gorging on crumbs on the restaurant's floor.

Stunned John Pringle, 30, was walking past the restaurant on Corporation Street in Manchester city centre when he spotted a rodent scuttling between tables for all to see.

Pizza Hut bosses have now called in pest control to evict the unwanted diner after seeing this photograph of the mouse in the window.

Nibble: Stunned John Pringle spotted the mouse gorging on crumbs, in full view at the foot of the glass window at a Pizza Hut in Manchester city centre

Mr Pringle, an investment consultant from 
the city centre, said: 'I was walking to the train station at around 
6.30am and I was shocked to see a mouse running around the restaurant 
floor eating crumbs.

'People
eat in the restaurant unaware there could be a number of mice actually 
living inside the restaurant where food is prepared.

'I do eat at Pizza Hut every so often, but I’ll think twice about doing so now.'

Astounded, he took a snap of the pest as it appeared to be chewing on bits of food hours before the restaurant had opened.

Up close: Pizza Hut says it has 'taken a number of precautionary measures to swiftly rectify the situation' after a mouse, pictured, was spotted in one of its restaurants and is 'confident' the problem is 'under control'

The fast food outlet, a popular venue 
for kids’ birthday parties, received a perfect score from the Food 
Standards Agency in their last assessment.

Health
experts branded the restaurant’s hygiene ‘very good’ and gave bosses a 
5/5 rating when they inspected on December 2, 2010.

But bosses were forced to call pest-control when contacted for a comment.

Mr Pringle added: 'I hope the photo will ensure Pizza Hut removes any rodent problem and improves cleaning within the restaurant.'

The fast food outlet, which seats hundreds a week, did not close while the incident was dealt with.

A Pizza Hut spokesman said it has regular contact with privately-contracted pest-controllers to stay on top of the risk they run as a city centre restaurant.

They said in a statement: 'At Pizza Hut we take health and safety in all our restaurants very seriously and have fully investigated this isolated incident.

'We have taken a number of precautionary measures to swiftly rectify the situation and we are confident that it is under control and there is no risk to our customers or products.'
