After months of wrangling the stadium that hosted the most magical moments of the London Olympics has finally got a new tenant.

West Ham have been handed the keys to the Olympic Stadium today after a deal for the tenancy was agreed.

The club were named as the preferred bidders in December but negotiations with the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) have been long and tortuous.

But the LLDC announced this morning that a deal has now been signed off that sees the Barclays Premier League club become anchor tenants under a 99-year lease.

The reported £150million facelift is due to be completed in time for the 2016-17 season.

The Olympic Stadium will be transformed into a 54,000-seater venue, with the Hammers now set to embark on a detailed, independent supporter consultation process.

The club's chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said in a joint statement: 'It's fantastic for everyone at West Ham United that at last all the club's hard work over the past three years has paid off.'

'Since we came to West Ham in 2010 we have had a vision to really take the club forward so West Ham United can compete on the pitch at the highest level.

Redevelopment: The reported £150million facelift is due to be completed in time for the 2016-17 season.

'Today's decision offers us a real platform to do this and we are fully committed to making it a real success.

'We understand the responsibilities that come with calling the nation's iconic Olympic Stadium, which will be converted into a world-class football stadium, our new home.

'It is an honour we will take on with pride.'

The lease will give the club long-term security but they will have no property interest in the stadium.

The
deal will protect public interest should West Ham’s owners sell the 
club for a large profit on the back of the move to the stadium - the 
LLDC would get a significant cut of any surplus.

The LLDC will have the rights to the 
income from other events such as music concerts and there will also be a
legacy for athletics, with a number of events for that sport 
maintained.

The 
retractable seating should allow the stadium to be changed from a 
football venue - with seats on the running track - to one suitable for 
athletics or concerts within eight days and potentially even quicker.

Before the deal was announced, Sports
minister Hugh Robertson 
said it made sense for a football club to be the main tenant at the 
stadium, and also suggested the venue could host the 2015 Rugby 
World Cup.

He said: 'I have always thought there
would be a really obvious end to this, which would be a multi-use 
stadium with football at its heart and that was always going to be the 
way to get the stadium used in post-Olympic mode.

'In
terms of the Rugby World Cup, there is an immovable deadline and all 
the evidence is we’ll get it done on time. As a country we are much 
better at doing these things than we were 10 years ago. 

Last obstacle: Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn is still seeking a judicial review on the bidding process

'Financially it’s quite tight, so the organisers need big stadiums for attractive games.'

Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn 
insists he is still seeking a judicial review into the bidding process but Robertson claims this is not a cause for concern.

He added: 'That is one for Boris [Johnson] but I am told that all the legal advice is that the review is likely to fail.'
