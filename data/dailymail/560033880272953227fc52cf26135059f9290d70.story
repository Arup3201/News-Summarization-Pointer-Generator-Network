Roberto Mancini donned his whistle once again as he took his first training sessions since being unveiled as the new Inter Milan boss.

The former Manchester City manager is back to work after parting ways with Galatasaray earlier this year following a budgeting dispute with the Turkish club. 

Revealed in a press conference by his new Inter Milan bosses on Saturday, Mancini led training sessions in rain and shine with those players not on international duty.

The 49-year-old will also be heading to the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday evening to watch the Euro 2016 qualifier between Italy and Croatia. 

One to watch in this crucial encounter will be Croatia and Inter starlet Mateo Kovacic, around whom Mancini plans to build his newly acquired team.

'Kovacic is a young, but with great quality and will become a champion,' Mancini told press this week.

Mancini wasted no time in getting back to work with the team that he led to three consecutive Serie A titles
