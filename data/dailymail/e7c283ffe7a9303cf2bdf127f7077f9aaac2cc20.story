New research has shown that Aussie travellers have stashed away over $800 million in leftover currency from their overseas trips.

The MasterCard Money Management Index estimates that $813 million in foreign currency is stuffed away in bedside tables and filing cabinets after being thrown aside by Australian travellers.

The research found 45% of Australians have travelled overseas in the past 12 months and on average have $221 in foreign currency sitting at home as a result.

The study predicts the habit of leftover currency will decline in coming years, as travellers embrace prepaid travel cards, which allow them to get a refund on leftover currency or save it until the next trip.

According to MasterCard Australia Country Manager, Andrew Cartwright, Australians love the convenience and safety of prepaid travel cards.

'Australians love a bargain when it comes to travel, and we're often conscious of our spending while we're away, he said.

'Yet, when we come home and empty our wallets, it turns out we are sitting on significant sums of leftover currency,'

'MasterCard has seen a 70% growth in prepaid cards since the beginning of 2013. In fact, 1 out of every 5 dollars Australians spend overseas on their MasterCard cards is now on a prepaid travel card.

'People don't need to rifle around in desks and drawers every time they head overseas, trying to find their leftover notes and coins,' Mr Cartwright said referring to the prepaid travel cards. 

Mr Cartwright said people feel safer when they aren't carrying around large amounts of cash and he believes prepaid cards avoid the hassle of dealing with conversion rates and commission costs while on holiday.

The Australian dollar has fallen from 95c against the US dollar in July, to around 87c today prompting would-be holidaymakers to act now and start using travel cards.

'Another benefit of a Prepaid travel card is that it allows you lock in the exchange rate on the day the card is loaded. As Australians watch the dollar decline, many are deciding to buy now before it drops any further,' Mr Cartwright said.
