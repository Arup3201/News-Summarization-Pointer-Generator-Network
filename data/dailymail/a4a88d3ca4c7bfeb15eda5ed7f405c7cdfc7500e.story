Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insists John Terry's 12-month contract extension is not a sentimental gesture after the club confirmed their captain's new deal on Thursday.

The 34-year-old central defender has penned fresh terms, worth in the region of £150,000 per week, which expire at the end of next season after another sterling campaign for the Stamford Bridge club.

The new deal does not include an option for a further year, but the Barclays Premier League leaders will provide Terry with another extension next season if he continues to play regularly.

Mourinho said earlier this year that there would be no issues regarding a new deal for Terry, and the Portuguese proved true to his word after Chelsea announced the news on Thursday.

Mourinho said: 'This new contract is not to say, "Thank you very much". It is because John continues to perform. He is a top defender. I am happy that he completely deserves this new contract after a season where he has already played 40 matches.'

Terry, who has made 661 appearances for Chelsea since making his debut in 1998 — scoring a club-record 63 goals for a defender — is on course to secure his fourth Premier League title this season to add to the success in the Capital One Cup earlier this month.

He said: 'I'm delighted to have signed an extension to my contract with Chelsea.

'After adding another major trophy to my collection this month I hope myself, the players and manager can continue to bring success to our club.

'Playing for this great club makes me so proud. And as always I would like to thank the fans who have continually supported me.' 

Terry's big-money new deal is a far cry from his days as a trainee. He revealed he used to warm the toilet seat for senior professionals during his time in the academy.

'I'd do anything for them,' Terry said. 'I'd make their teas and coffees, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground.

'It's bizarre when you think about it but that was part of growing up.'

After signing the new deal Terry hopes to stay at Chelsea for some time to come.

Terry told Chelsea TV: 'It's been a great couple of years for me. My form has been good and I've earned the contract, so I'm delighted to stay for another year. And hopefully there could be a few more years after this.'

The central defender, who has retired from England duty, lifted the Capital One Cup with Chelsea on March 1 - his 13th major honour with the Blues - and hopes to add the Premier League title.

Chelsea entered the international break with a six-point advantage over nearest rivals Manchester City and with a game in hand.

'Hopefully there's many more (trophies),' Terry added.

'That's a massive part of why I'm staying. I want to win trophies. I want to remain in the side, of course, and for me to get to 14 (trophies), 15, that's my target.

'We're very close at the moment. We still need to get over the line. It's going to be tough. The Hull game (a 3-2 win last weekend) showed how tough it's going to be.

'To get that big one at the end of the season would be fantastic. Then we can regroup and go again next year. I'm delighted to be here and hopefully there's going to be many more.'
