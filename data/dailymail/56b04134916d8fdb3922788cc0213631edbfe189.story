A Regimental sergeant major who bullied a triple amputee paratrooper has left his position after an exposé by The Mail on Sunday.

Warrant Officer Alistair Hutcheson, 54, had been working as an instructor in the Defence College of Logistics at Deepcut Barracks, Surrey, before this newspaper revealed how his mistreatment drove disabled Afghan war hero Corporal Tom Neathway, 30, out of the Army.

Hutcheson, who was censured by superiors over his harassment of Neathway, has now cleared his desk and is not expected to return, defence sources said last night.

over several months in 2011 and that the harassment was 'cumulative in 
effect over time'

Corporal Tom Neathway claims he was driven out of the Army by his Regimental Sergeant Major, Alistair Hutcheson, who bullied him

Corporal Neathway lost both legs and his left arm in a bomb blast while he was serving with the 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para) in Afghanistan's Helmand province

They said that he is taking leave that is owed to him and that his contract with the Army will run  out in August.

A
 source said: ‘Many officers and soldiers at Deepcut had no idea about 
what Hutcheson had done in his past. They were very angry with the 
Army’s chain of command for not informing them.’

Cpl Neathway of the 2nd
 Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (2 Para), broke his silence yesterday
 after a Government report revealed a 25 per cent rise in reported 
cases  of Armed Forces bullying in the past year.

An official inquiry found that Hutcheson had singled out Neathway when they worked together at a parachute training school at RAF Brize Norton in 2011.

This abuse included getting staff to make excessive numbers  of telephone calls to the disabled soldier asking where he was, and making unreasonable demands  that he should wear military uniform which he found difficult due to his artificial limbs.

The Mail on Sunday also revealed that in 1991 Hutcheson was fined £500 by the Army for physically abusing a recruit in Aldershot. Hutcheson transferred to Deepcut in September 2013.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The Army takes all incidents of bullying and harassment extremely seriously.’
