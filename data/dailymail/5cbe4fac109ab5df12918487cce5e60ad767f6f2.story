Images have emerged showing actor Cory Monteith with what appears to be injection marks on his arm, almost a year before he died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol.

The pictures, taken on July 9 2012 in Los Angeles, show the actor on a lunch date with his girlfriend Lea Michelle and with visible marks on the inside of his left arm.

The Glee actor was found dead at the age of 31 alone in his hotel room on Saturday in Canada.

Marked: Cory Monteith was pictured on July 9 2012 with what appears to marks on the inside of his arm

According to RadarOnline Cory was seen again with what appeared to be ‘track marks’ on his arm while in New York a month later in 2012, suggesting it would have been obvious to most people that he was using.

Troubled: The marks suggest the actor may have been using heroin for over a year

It is thought his girlfriend and co-star Lea, who was a driving force behind his second entry to rehab in April of this year, didn’t know he was using heroin again.

The actress is believed to have taken over planning his memorial service and other aspects connected to his death.

His mother meanwhile is reported not to have any part in the planning.

TMZ report that sources connected to Lea and Cory say she tried to protect her boyfriend as much as possible, in particular when it came to his drug problems.

The website claims that according to one relative the actor was messed about in Hollywood by ‘a zoo of piranhas’ and Lea took it upon herself to protect him once they became a couple. 

It’s thought that while Lea was with Cory she could guide him about his substance abuse, however it was on his visits to Canada that her control went out the window. 

The British Columbia Coroners Service revealed the autopsy results on Tuesday, adding that the investigation into his death is continuing, and that no further details were available at this time.

It was noted that at this stage there is still no evidence to suggest that Mr. Monteith's death was 'anything other than a most-tragic accident'.

Police Constable Brian Montague said, 'There was evidence in the room that was consistent of a drug overdose,' said Constable Brian Montague, adding that he wouldn't 'go into specifics'. 

The cause of death has come as a shock to some after it was initially reported that police did not believe drugs to have been involved, but Montague explained they need to err on the side of caution.

'It was the opinion of the investigators that it was a drug overdose, but we didn’t want to speculate,' he said. 'The last thing we would want to do is speculate a drug overdose and then have that not be the case.'

Autopsy: Cory died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed

A medical team from the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority performed the postmortem exam.

'Mr. Monteith was alone [in his hotel room] when he died,' a Vancouver Police Department spokesperson said. 'He took the heroin when he was alone by himself.'

Monteith was found dead in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver on Saturday around noon.

It is still unclear what happened to Monteith in the hours leading up to his death.

He and his manager dined on Thursday night with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'.

According to authorities, Monteith and three unidentified people left his hotel room on Friday night and that the actor returned alone at around 2:15 a.m. Hotel staff found his body shortly after noon when Monteith didn't check out.
