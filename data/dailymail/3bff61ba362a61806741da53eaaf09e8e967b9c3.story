An Osama bin Laden doll made as part of a secret CIA project in 2005 and designed by the creator of G.I Joe is up for sale by online auction.

The 12-inch bin Laden doll, one of only three to be made, was part of a programme called 'Devil Eyes' which planned to distribute the dolls to children in Afghanistan to encourage them to reject al-Qaeda.

Donald Levine, a proud Korean War veteran and creator of GI Joe, designed the doll with manufacturers in China.

The toy has two detachable heads including a demon-like version of Bin Laden with a red face and green eyes

The toy has two detachable heads, one 'normal' head with a turban and a beard and another demon-like depiction of the now dead terrorist group leader with a red face and green eyes.

The project didn't meet approval with the 'influence operation' though, leaving just three dolls completed, two of which are in the CIA's possession.

When Levine died in May this year, his estate decided they would sell the doll through Nate D. Sanders auction house, with bidding starting $2,500 (£1,600).

The 12-inch doll was part of a programme called 'Devil Eyes' which planned to distribute the dolls to children in Afghanistan to encourage them to reject al-Qaeda

The auction house describes the doll as a 'scarce and nearly unbelievable prototype of Osama Bin Laden doll intended for use in Arab countries in order to dissuade children from idolizing the terror leader.'

The auctioneers say the dolls is in near fine condition due to two small glue stains on the white robe and that there is a certificate of authenticity from Levine's son.
