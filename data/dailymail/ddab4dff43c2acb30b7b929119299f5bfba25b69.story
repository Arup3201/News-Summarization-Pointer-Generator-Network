For years, Nicklas Bendtner has unofficially held the title of Lord, albeit mostly in jest.

But now, the former Arsenal striker can legitimately claim to be Lord Bendtner, after Danish magazine SE Og HOR are said to have bought him one square foot of land in Glencoe Wood, Scotland.

After hundreds of tweets and even a twitter account in his name - @LordBendtner - the wolf of Wolfsburg has finally been rewarded with the title his many legions of fans believe he is worthy of.

Nicklas Bendtner, now at Wolfsburg, has been made a Lord after a Danish magazine bought him a plot of land

The former Arsenal striker, who left the club last summer, thinks 'it's a fun gimmick', according to his agent

And Bendtner is said to be delighted with the news, according to his agent Elisa Lykke. 

She said: 'We have seen it, and Nicklas thinks it's a fun gimmick.

'We have asked to be sent a receipt and we are pleased that it supports a nature conservation area.' 

Bendtner was previously made aware of the nickname, and spoke of his confusion during an interview with a German magazine.

The Danish striker has currently scored one goal for Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga this season

For years, Bendtner has held the title of 'Lord' among his fans on social media site Twitter

'The problem with this [nickname] is that I do not know where it comes from and understand if it is funny,' he told Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.  

'Am I being ridiculed? Is it serious? I think it is a phenomenon of the youth [on social media]. They think that sounds good.'

Bendtner left Arsenal for good in the summer, joining Bundesliga club Wolfsburg on a three-year-deal. 

Unfortunately for the Danish striker, it hasn't worked out quite as planned and he has only managed one league goal this season.

A brace in the Europa League has been the highlight of his short career in Germany, but perhaps his new-found title will improve his fortunes on the pitch, too.
