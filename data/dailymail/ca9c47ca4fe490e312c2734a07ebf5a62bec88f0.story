An Afghan man found dead in a shipping container in Essex was trying to escape a loan shark demanding more than £240,000, reports claim.

Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, died in front of his wife and two sons crammed on top of chemical barrels 

The family is said to have fled Jalalabad 18 months ago  in a bid to escape the warlord who loaned Mr Kapoor $70,000 (£42,000) to set up a clothing firm.

Fled: Meet Singh Kapoor died in this container after allegedly fleeing a £240,000 debt to a warlord loan shark

But two weeks ago, he was found dead alongside 35 other Afghan Sikhs – including 13 children – crammed inside the container, which had just arrived at Tilbury Docks from Belgium. 

Last night, his uncle Dilip Singh told The Times Mr Kapoor had no option but to turn to smugglers as he could not afford to pay the debt, which was rapidly increasing in value.

Mr Singh said his nephew did not expect to be in a container, adding: 'Traffickers always say it will be easy and there will be no big problems. He must have trusted them.'

Pictures, released by Essex Police, show the stowaways had barely enough room to move and nowhere to relieve themselves.

They were eventually rescued at the port of Tilbury in Essex after staff heard screaming and banging coming from inside the large box on a P&O freight ferry from Belgium.

The metal container which was clearly labelled ‘Hudig and Kersten’ - on board a ship from Zeebrugge - was opened up by staff at around 6.30am on Saturday morning.

The distraught people inside – including 13 children - were treated at the scene and at a local hospital for severe dehydration and hypothermia. Father-of-two Mr Singh Kapoor was declared dead at the scene.

The group were among a tiny minority of Sikhs left in Afghanistan and are believed to have fled the country six months ago after suffering persecution.

After being released, the Afghans said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting ‘in and out of consciousness’.

One of the immigrants, a man in 30s, told the Daily Mail that the survivors had been left frazzled by their ordeal and were struggling to piece together their harrowing journey.

Kamaljit Singh Matharu, who has been acting as a translator for the group, said: ‘The immigrants have been through a lot, they are traumatised.

‘They are still very frightened and confused.’ The group had been trafficked into the UK via the Belgium port of Zeebrugge.

Belgian police believe the immigrants were already inside when the container was delivered to the port before setting sail for Britain.
