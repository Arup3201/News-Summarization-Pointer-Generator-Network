Rail firms were accused last night of trying to ‘bury bad news’ by releasing details of big fare rises under cover of the Virgin franchise fiasco.

The Association of Train Operating Companies has finally confirmed the extent of the hikes that will take effect next month. Some are as high as 10 per cent.

It sought to spin the figures by insisting the average increase from January 2 would be 3.9 per cent.But Anthony Smith, of the watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘Passengers going to buy their ticket on a cold January morning won’t be paying an “average fare” – they will be paying a fare that may have gone up by more than that.

Hike: Figures released today show the average increase to rail fares on January 2 will be 3.9 per cent

‘Hard-pressed passengers ... will feel the pinch.’

He said an off-peak return between 
London and Plymouth on First Great Western will rise 8.3 per cent to 
£111.50 while Birmingham-London on Chiltern will go up 10 per cent to 
£27.50.

The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said the average increase on January 2 would be 3.9 per cent.

But the Atoc was accused of trying to downplay the figures, after it was said many passengers would face much higher price hikes.

And rail companies were accused of trying to 'bury bad news' as they sneaked out the details of the fare rises under the cover of the Virgin franchise fiasco.

Passenger Focus said an off-peak return from London-Plymouth on First Great Western will rise from £103 to £111.50 (up 8.3 per cent) while from Birmingham-London on Chiltern will go up from £25 to £27.50 (up 10 per cent).

Prices will take effect from January 2 2013.

Ramsgate-London £4,940 6.46%

Dover Priory-London £4,940 6.46%

Folkestone-London £4,888 5.98%

Canterbury-London £4,860 5.9%

Tonbridge-London £3,796 5.2%

Guildford-London £3,224 4.3%

Portsmouth-London £4,668 4.2%

Bournemouth-London £5,988 4.2%

Reading-London £3,960 4.2%

Oxford-London £4,532 4.2%

Hove-London (Victoria) £3,860 4.1%

Eastbourne-London (Victoria) £4,228 4.1%

Aylesbury-London £3,632 3.2%

Shenfield-London £2,704 minus 0.6%

Huntingdon-London £4,700 4.2%

Cambridge-London £4,400 3.8%

Llanelli-Swansea £624 5.4%

Bangor-Llandudno £1,140 5.2%

Ludlow-Hereford £1,992 5.3

An Anytime return from London to Norwich on Greater Anglia will go up from £98.60 to £107.70 - up 9.2 per cent.

Mr Smith said: 'It’s disappointing 
that the restraint shown on season ticket prices has not been extended 
to all Off-peak and Anytime fares.

In the current economic climate, 
already hard-pressed passengers who face these rises will feel the 
pinch.’

Manuel Cortes, general secretary of 
the TSSA union, said: ‘Not only do Atoc try to bury bad news by 
announcing fare increases on the same day as the West Coast franchise 
fiasco report, they then try to hide the massive hike in unregulated 
off-peak fares - three times more than inflation.’

Mr Cortez added: ‘These increases are
normally announced in November but have been deliberately held back to 
avoid another own-goal for the private industry which relies on £4 
billion of taxpayer subsidies every year.’

Passenger Focus said that although 
the government announced that it would limit the rise in regulated fares in 
England to the inflation figure plus one per cent -  rather than the 3 
per cent that was previously proposed -  train companies still have 
flexibility to increase some fares beyond that.

The level of increase on non-regulated fares, which include some off-peak trips, is entirely at the discretion of operators.

This means some of these fares are likely to far exceed the 3.9 per cent average rise.

Atoc chief executive Michael Roberts 
said: ‘Fare rises are determined largely by Government policy, and the 
Chancellor confirmed the Government's approach for next year in the 
Autumn Statement.

'We know nobody likes paying more for
their journey, especially to go to work. But railway funding can only 
come from the taxpayer or from the passenger, and the government's 
policy remains that a bigger share must come from people who use the 
train.’

Rail Minister Norman Baker said: 'We 
are engaged in the biggest rail investment programme since the 19th 
century and it is only right that the passenger, as well as the 
taxpayer, contributes towards that.’

Passengers from the Kent stations of 
Deal, Dover Priory and Ramsgate will see their season tickets rise 6.46%
to £4,940 on January 2.

Other above-average rises include 
Folkestone-London (up 5.98 per cent to £4,888), Canterbury-London (up 
5.9 per cent to £4,860) and Tonbridge-London (up 5.2 per cent) to 
£3,796).

All season tickets are classed as regulated fares where a 4.2 per cent average rise cap exists for January 2013.

Hard-pressed passengers are likely to feel the squeeze as some routes are set to increase in price by as much as 10 per cent

Some season tickets are not rising as
much as 4.2 per cent, while others are on, or very close, to the 
average. Others are higher.

The cost of a season ticket from 
Shenfield in Essex to London, for example, actually dips in price, from 
£2,720 to £2,704, while an Ellesmere Port to Chester annual ticket is 
rising only 2.3 per cent to £720.

Among season ticket fares that are 
rising by less than 4 per cent are Aylesbury-London (up 3.2 per cent), Cambridge-London 
(up 3.8 per cent), Tain-Inverness (up 3.8 per cent) and Stirling-Glasgow (up 3.9 per cent).
