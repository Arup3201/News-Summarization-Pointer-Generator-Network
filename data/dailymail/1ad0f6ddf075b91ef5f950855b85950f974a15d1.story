Arsenal have become the first Premier League club to reach five million followers on Twitter.

The north London club said in a news release on Monday that they had consolidated their position as the third most followed team on the social network behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.

In a news release Richard Clarke, managing editor of the club's media group: 'We are delighted to have engaged so many passionate Arsenal fans around the world.

'The interest continues to grow and we constantly evolve our approach to keep our fans engaged with what is happening across every aspect of the club.'

Mathieu Debuchy, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere took part in a YouTube video to celebrate the historic milestone, thanking some of their higher profile followers for the 'follow'.

The quintet stood around a table stacked with huge books, pretending to reach out each name one by one.

The Gunners now around 0.6 million more followers than London rivals Chelsea, who currently stand at £4.85m.

Galatasaray make up the top five most popular football clubs on Twitter, around the £4.5m mark, while Manchester United, in sixth, and Liverpool, in eighth, also claim a place in the top 10. 

Arsenal will be hoping their off-field success starts to reflect on their on-field performances, after a disappointing opening half to the season.

Arsene Wenger's side lie four points off fourth placed West Ham going into the busy festive period and 12 off the leaders Chelsea.
