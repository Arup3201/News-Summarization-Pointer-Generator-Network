An elderly Nevada couple has been forced out of their home because of the government shutdown.

Joyce Spencer, 77, and husband Ralph, 80, were told Thursday by furloughed park rangers they had to leave their Lake Mead home because it sits on federal park land, this despite owning the home outright and Mr Spencer recovering from cancer

Instead of enjoying their golden years beside a beautiful lake, the Spencers have instead found themselves scrambling to find a place to stay, with Ms Spencer spending most days working in the family ice cream shop, according to KTNV.

Displaced: Joyce Spencer and husband Ralph were forced out of their lakeside home due to the government shutdown

Forced out of a cabin they’ve lived in since the 1970’s, the two grandparents were given 24 hours to vacate, Ms Spencer told the station. The forced eviction has left Ralph Spencer, a Korean War veteran, distraught and distrusting of the government.

'He's very discouraged by it,' daughter Tisha Cook told CNN. 'Notice he's not on any camera interviews. 'He's lost his trust in everything at this point. He doesn't trust anyone. He feels like anything that he's worked and done, everything in his hard-earned life, has been stripped from him.'

Explaining that her parents' lakeside home is near Las Vegas, Ms Cook said the location was ideal for her father as he received cancer treatments at a Sin City hospital.

Located on Stewart’s Point, the home is on land that is part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which is federal parkland. The Spencers were forced to leave after officials advised ‘they could not provide services,’ she told the station.

Despite the gross inconvenience, the displaced granny is taking her predicament in stride.

‘I had to go to town today and buy Ralph undershirts and jeans because I forgot his pants,’ she told the station.

Paradise lost: No longer at their lakeside home, the Spencers have been forced to live with nearby relatives

Off limits: This sign barring entry to the park was placed at the end of the road leading to the Spencers' home

Park Officials are only allowing home owners to return to retrieve belongings.

‘Unfortunately overnight stays are not permitted until a budget is passed and the park can reopen,’ officials said in a statement.

Banished from their lakeside paradise, the Spencers are not staying with family – but the move did not come without its challenges.

Back to work: Ms Spencer has spent her days slaving away in the family ice cream shop

‘I had to be sure and get his walker and his scooter that he has to go in, Ms Spencer explained. 'We're not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants.’

Even so, Ms Spencer wants to go home, shutdown or otherwise, and her daughter agrees.
