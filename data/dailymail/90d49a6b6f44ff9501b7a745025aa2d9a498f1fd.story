It looks like the Detroit Pistons have found themselves a new shooting guard.

At half-time during the Pistons vs Knicks game on Friday night, one of the team's dancers, Kathryn Martin, scored an incredible half-court shot with her back to the basket.

In a video of the astonishing feat, the 24-year-old bends down before hoisting the ball over her head and backwards towards the net.

'Ooooh,' the crowd can be heard murmuring as the ball soars towards the basket.

She watches in anticipation, while court staff pay little attention to her attempt.

But to their astonishment - as well as to the shock of the fans and Martin herself - the shot goes in, hitting nothing but the net.

The spectators scream as Martin looks on in disbelief, raising her hands in the air in victory.

As she struggles to catch her breath, the team's mascot, Hooper the horse, swoops her up and carries her away.

Martin made the incredible shot during half time at Saturday night's Pistons game against the New York Knicks in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Knicks won 121-115.

'The way the Pistons shot in the second half, they should have suited her up,' one viewer wrote beneath the video after it was shared on YouTube.

On Saturday, the Pistons also lost to the Washington Wizards, 99-95.

Martin, who has a long-term boyfriend, joined the team's dancers in August 2012.
