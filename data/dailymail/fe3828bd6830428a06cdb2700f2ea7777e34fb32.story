The Ministry of Defence was yesterday forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of RAF staff following an embarrassing security blunder over pictures of Prince William.

Ten photographs of the future king in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot were published by St James’s Palace yesterday on the Duke’s website before being cleared by the MoD.

The pictures, taken by an RAF photographer, had been intended to show off a ‘day in the life’ of the prince on base as Flight Lieutenant Wales at RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales.

They were considered something of a coup for his new website, www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org.

But the publicity exercise back-fired within hours as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four of the shots.

In one, William is in a briefing room in front of a computer with a password prompt screen open.

Another shows a document on the desk 
and an email open on a computer. Other photographs show details of 
passwords and user names pinned up on a wall.

By the time horrified defence 
officials spotted the mistake – some four hours after publication online
– the shots had appeared on websites around the world, on TV and in 
newspapers including the Evening Standard in London.

They were ‘re-released’ with the 
details pixellated, but the MoD had no choice but to reset passwords of 
some personnel ‘as a precaution’.

It said: ‘Due to an administrative 
oversight, these photographs were not properly cleared at RAF Valley. 
They have now been amended.’

St James’s Palace said: ‘The pictures were taken by an RAF photographer and any security issues are a matter for the MoD.’

The amended photos, which capture the prince's normal working day, show that while the Duke of Cambridge may be second in line to the throne, as a working member of the RAF Prince William clearly doesn’t stand on ceremony.

The photographs of Prince William on duty at RAF Valley were published on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new official website, which was unveiled as the couple prepare to create their own court at Kensington Palace.

The establishment of the Household Office of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is being viewed as a sign William is preparing to leave his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot to embark on a life of Royal duty with wife Kate.

The couple's official activities, including the new website, are being funded by Prince Charles using his income from the Duchy of Cornwall, his private estate.

As Flight Lieutenant Wales of the 
Search and Rescue (SAR) unit based at RAF Valley on Anglesey, north 
Wales, William is happy to brew up a pot of tea and make his own bed.

Whether taking the controls of his Sea
King helicopter or enjoying a plate of pasta and a laugh with his 
crewmates, it is clear that the prince loves his ‘normal’ life in the 
forces.

Although he shares a rented farmhouse 
with his wife, Kate, when on round-the-clock duty William stays in staff
accommodation on base.

His tiny bedroom is just like that of 
any officer – containing a chair, desk and single bed, which he has to 
make himself in the morning.

William, 30, can also be seen using 
the base’s tiny kitchen to make a cup of tea as he and his colleagues 
make up their flight plans and wait for their next ‘shout’.

The prince’s working day begins with a
briefing from the off-going SAR crew about the state of their aircraft 
and weather conditions.

As his crew need to be airborne within
15 minutes of receiving a call-out from the moment they go on duty, 
such briefings are a hugely important part of their shift.

According to the website, the future 
king often likes to while away the hours waiting for his next emergency 
call by playing video games, particularly Call Of Duty or other 
military-themed games.

However as SAR crews are, like many in
the forces, expected to fly into conditions from which others are 
fleeing, much of their day is spent honing and maintaining their flying 
skills.

William has been based at RAF Valley since 2010.

He qualified as a helicopter captain in June and now leads a four-man crew.

Valley is renowned for covering some 
of the most varied and challenging terrain in the UK, involving both sea
and mountain rescues.

On duty he works a 24-hour shift at the base and must never be more than 60 seconds from his machine, ready to be airborne.

The prince has been involved in 
several dramatic missions, most recently one in August in which he 
rescued two teenage girls who were being swept out to sea.

Many of those he has helped to rescue say they weren’t even aware of his identity at the time.

With pressure growing on the prince to
give up his life in the military to relieve the burden on his elderly 
grandparents, the pictures may become one of the most precious records 
of his much-loved stint in the military.

William must decide by the beginning of next year whether to extended his current tour of duty, which concludes next September.

Although he was initially keen to 
extend his service, the prince is acutely aware of calls to become a 
full time working royal, particularly in light of his elderly 
grand-father’s recent bouts of ill-health.
