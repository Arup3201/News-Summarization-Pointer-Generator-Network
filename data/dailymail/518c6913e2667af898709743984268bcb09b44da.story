Moviegoers at a screening of the new Batman film were left fearing for their lives when a cinema attendant burst into the theatre dressed as super-villain Bane, just hours after a gunman in the same costume opened fire on an audience in the US.

The prank took place at the Vue cinema in Worcester on Friday, less than 24 hours after the massacre at the Aurora, Colorado, screening of The Dark Knight Rises.

The stunt has been condemned by 'appalled and sickened' audience members who have written to Vue demanding an apology.

Scene: The incident took place at the Vue cinema in Worcester on Friday

Schoolteacher Elizabeth Atkinson, 24, was at the screening with brothers James, 27, 
and Leo, 19.

She said: 'In light of the recent 
and tragic event during the screening of the new Batman film in Aurora, 
Colorado, I was shocked and appalled by the attitude displayed by the 
staff at the Vue cinema here in Worcester.

The prankster was dressed as Bane, Tom Hardy's character in The Dark Knight Rises

'While the trailers were in progress,
 one of the cinema attendants entered the screen room wearing a gas mask
 and stood to the side looking at the audience.

'This
 is exactly as the gunman in Colorado was reported to have been dressed.

'I was not the only one who found this to be extremely disconcerting and
 inappropriate.

'I 
raised my concerns to other staff members outside, explaining that this 
attendant was causing discomfort.

'The response I received was one to 
suggest that they were either unaware of the recent shooting, or they 
were indifferent to it.

'I
 was told simply that he was "Dressed as the villain, Bane".

It was only
 when I explained further that the Colorado gunman was also dressed in 
this way, that the attendant was spoken to and the mask removed.

'One
 would have expected that the management of the Vue cinema would have 
been sensitive to this issue and dissuaded the staff members from 
dressing up. This incident was at best in poor taste, and at worst a 
sickening lack of respect.'

Her brother James has written a letter of complaint to Vue.

Mr Atkinson, a freelance film maker, 
wrote 'Even though I knew he was meant to be dressed as the character 
Bane from the film, I felt it was incredibly insensitive indeed in light
 of the recent shootings in America by a man wearing a gas mask.'

A spokesman for Vue cinemas said: 'Our 
staff are passionate about movies and often wear fancy dress on the 
opening day of blockbuster films.

'On this occasion a staff member started his shift in fancy dress, but removed it within minutes of being on site.

'We in no way meant to cause offence and wholeheartedly apologise for this misplaced enthusiasm.

'Everyone at Vue Entertainment has been deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic incident that took place in Denver.

'Our thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who have been killed and injured.'

James Holmes, aged 24, appeared in 
court in the US yesterday, with his hair dyed red, accused of the shooting, which claimed the lives of 12 people, including that of a 
six-year old girl.

The
 gun attack during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in 
Aurora, near Denver, left 59 others wounded, many critically.
