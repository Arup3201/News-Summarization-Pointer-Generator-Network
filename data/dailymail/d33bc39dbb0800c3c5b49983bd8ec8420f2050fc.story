Michelle Obama met with victims wounded during last month's massacre at a movie theater and thanked the medical staff that treated them during a surprise visit to the Medical Center of Aurora.

The First Lady arrived at the hospital in Colorado at 3.30pm on Saturday. She spoke to doctors, nurses and staff who attended some of the 58 people wounded after the attack at a showing of the latest Batman movie.

She also met with some of the shooting victims and their families, including one patient who remains in the hospital's intensive care unit. Twelve people were killed in the attack.

Around 50 staff members gathered in a conference room to shake hands and hug the First Lady.

The hospital received 18 patients in the immediate aftermath of the shooting which happened at a movie theater less than three miles away.

Obama asked how many people in the room had been up for more than 24 hours, according to the Denver Post, and immediately drew laughter when one nurse raised her hand and the First Lady immediately hugged her.

Obama, who was dressed casually in beige pants and a pink sweater, spent more than an hour at the hospital before leaving for Denver.

She attended a fundraiser at the Museum of Contemporary Art in the city for her husband's re-election campaign.

Two days after the shooting, President Obama showed his support with a visit to the University of Colorado Hospital, which also treated some of the injured.

James Holmes is accused of killing 12 people 
and wounding 58 in the attack during a midnight showing of the Dark 
Knight. Holmes' attorneys say that he is mentally ill.

University of Colorado psychiatrist Dr 
Lynne Fenton, who counseled the suspected shooter, reportedly tried to 
discuss her worries about his mental condition with staff and at least 
one campus police officer in early June.

Holmes has been charged with 24 counts of first-degree murder, 116 counts of criminal intent to commit murder and one count of illegal possession of an explosive device.
