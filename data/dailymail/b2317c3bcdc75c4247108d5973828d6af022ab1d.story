Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column, Martin talks about his controversial cardigan, why an old rift means he can't get along with Keith Hackett and how he was nearly scared out of the ITV studio...

MAD DOG'S MAD CARDY

I hear my multi-coloured cardigan caused quite a stir when I wore it as a pundit on ITV’s FA Cup highlights show on Saturday night.

I’ve just moved house and half of my stuff is in storage, so I got it in the Boxing Day sales from Hackett London. I thought it looked 'Mad'!

It was bright, had character and personality. It’s not like the dull, bland, boring clothes you normally see on TV.

The other option was a Marks & Spencer navy-blue V-neck sweater, but I suppose that’s just not me.

You can’t beat a bit of colour and a bit of positive energy; I thought it suited me perfectly.

What are you saying about my cardy? Martin Allen thought the knitwear matched his personality

OUT OF MY LEAGUE

I was at the ITV studios from 2pm through to half past midnight - we were watching all of the games and then recording the show.

In between games a young man called Jordan who is the ‘runner’ showed me to my dressing room.I could not believe it. As I walked down the corridor there was a room each for the Loose Women, there was one for Jonathan Ross, one for Alan Carr and another for Graham Norton.

The next room I came to, the name read: Martin Allen. I smiled, shook my head and thought: ‘I am well out of my league here.’

High company: Allen had his own dressing room, like TV personality Jonathan Ross (pictured centre)

THE 'ALLEN FAMILY' FA CUP DRAW

About two months ago, I got a call from a man at the FA asking if I would like to do the FA Cup draw. You know, pull the balls out of the bag.

He said he wanted it to be on the ‘Allen Family’ theme. I replied: ‘I think you want my cousins Clive and Paul, not me.’ But he insisted he wanted me to come in and do it.

Well, I’ve admired, adored and cherished the FA Cup competition throughout my life, and what an honour, what a privilege, to be invited to Wembley to draw the balls for the first time.

I always thought they had former international players or famous people. I never played for England.

Keeping his eye on the ball: Allen was proud to be able to take part in the FA Cup draw

You know it’s live, you know millions of people are watching and you just don’t want to mess it up.

It’s straight forward, picking a ball out and then announcing it, anyone can do it.

The instructions are: Keep your hand shoulder level and hold the ball out for three seconds, then put in the tray.

After the reaction from Saturday night I thought the cardigan should get a second airing. I had a text message after the draw from a friend asking if I’d got it 'buy-one-get-one-free'.

I see that Adrian Chiles mentioned it, too. I’ll go back to the shop to see if I can pick up a double XL for him.

The whole experience was amazing.

Watch out, Adrian! Chiles may find himself with a matching version of Mad Dog's cardigan if he's not careful

NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL – EXCEPT A SPIDER!

My son George, who, believe it or not, is an extremely talented mathematician and qualified chartered accountant, is always on at me to get a place on that TV programme in the jungle, called 'I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here'.

George knows my deepest fears and how scared I am of spiders, mice, snakes, and anything creepy-crawly.

I got a text late on Saturday night from George, telling me a spider was creeping up my arm as I was talking about Leeds on the FA Cup highlights show.

I had absolutely no idea. If I’d known a spider was there, I would’ve been out of that studio in no time at all.

Scary times: Allen hates spiders and if he'd spotted this one crawling all over him he'd have fled the scene

RICH OWNERS RUINING THE CUP

The magic of the cup was there for all to see at the weekend. There were 5,500 Sheffield United fans going crazy at Villa Park, there was relief on Mark Robins’ face when Huddersfield escaped from courageous Grimsby with a late win and the pained look on Brian McDermott when Leeds lost to Rochdale was unmistakable.

Last week, Paul Lambert made a point that every Premier League manager is thinking when he said the FA Cup is not as important as the league. But Paul could’ve chosen his words more carefully.

Football club owners, financial directors, shareholders and stake holders in Premier League clubs only have an interest in the bottom line.

All about survival: Paul Lambert is not the only manager who doesn't make the FA Cup a priority

Their priority is not silverware, their priority is to make money, make their club a global brand and cash in on the Premier League TV rights deal.

There’ll be managers only intent in staying in the Premier League. There are a group of managers trying their best to get the fourth Champions League place and of course there are three or four clubs attempting to win the Premier League title.

The FA Cup, for these managers and these clubs, is most definitely second on the agenda, and even third, for those competing in the Champions League. But for all the other Football League and Conference clubs it is the opportunity to go scalp hunting.

HACKED OFF WITH HACKETT

The furthest I ever managed to get in the competition was the semi-final at Villa Park, playing for West Ham against Nottingham Forest in 1991. The referee that day was Mr Keith Hackett.

He was a decent referee and a good man. However, after 22 minutes our centre-back Tony Gale challenged Gary Crosby and Mr Hackett deemed it to be a straight red card. The decision was ludicrous.

Forest knocked the ball about in typical Brian Clough style and we lost 4-1, conceding two late goals. But the Wembley dream was over with that red card.

Dreams smashed: Keith Hackett made a mistake when he sent off Tony Gale in the FA Cup semi-final

To be fair to Keith, we had a good chat afterwards and he explained to me that he realised he had made a mistake and just how costly it was to everybody at West Ham United. He was genuinely sorry and I shook his hand and thought to myself: ‘Fair play to him for apologising.’ Not many people are man enough to stand up and admit they were wrong.

Last year, at the beginning of the season, I was invited by the League Manager’s Association to meet the head of the referees to go through the new rules and regulations and ask any questions.

I arrived bang on time, and a nice lady gave me a nice cup of coffee with a saucer.

I pitched myself quietly on the back row. Low and behold, sat twenty yards in front of me was their general manager, and he was introduced as Mr Keith Hackett. I couldn’t stop thinking about that red card.

My cup and saucer started to shake, the eyes got frosty and the froth and saliva was dripping down my chin.

I never heard a word that was said for the next three hours as I sat there and stared out Keith Hackett.

Not forgiven: Allen seethed all the way through a briefing from Hackett because of this incident

SOUTHAMPTON’S SOUR GRAPES

Talking of referees, I can’t believe Southampton made a complaint about what Mark Clattenburg said to Adam Lallana.

He supposedly told the player he’d changed since he played for England. So what?

In all honesty I find it quite ridiculous, and respect should be shown to the referee.

Ridiculous: What Mark Clattenburg supposedly said to Adam Lallana was not worth mentioning

The improvement in refs in the last 10 years has been amazing. With the speed of the game and the scrutiny through the media, it’s important these men and women are protected and looked after. They do a good job in difficult circumstances.

Let’s face it we have the opportunity to lie on the sofa and watch replays from the front, from the back, from the side, from above, in slow motion, and most of the time it’s still difficult to decide whether it was a right or wrong decision.

Managers are far too critical of referees after matches nowadays. It should be stamped down on by the LMA, the FA and the Premier League. Referees have got a hard enough job as it is.

DISTRACTED BY DIVERS

Referees are not helped by all this diving, either.

Almost 11 years ago I watched Jose Mourinho’s Porto take on Celtic. Deco, the Portugal midfielder, was absolutely outstanding.

He professionally played for fouls to break up the rhythm of the game and take away the intensity of the Park Head supporters. He did this skilfully and craftily.

By putting his body between the ball and the defender, and waiting for the player to make the challenge for the ball, he was fouled repeatedly.

Back in the day: Deco, left, was a talented player and had a knack for winning free kicks

Afterwards Martin O’Neill, in charge at Celtic, slammed Mourinho for his tactics and style of play. It would be something that the legend Brian Clough, with his good English values, would have despised.

European players know how to win a free kick. It’s creeping in more and more to our football, especially when teams have adapted their style of play to pass their way through the middle of the pitch, similar to Arsenal and Barcelona, rather than just look to get crosses in for a man at the near or far post.

It’s here to stay and I’m sure the referees will be clamping down on it and doing their utmost to stop it spreading through the game.

No way: Ramires was never going to win a penalty with this awful dive against Derby County

I bought the knitwear in the Boxing Day sales but it caused a stir

Here's how you have to act when doing the FA Cup draw

The Cup is being ruined by rich owners and clubs who have other aims

Referees need to be protected and not bashed like Saints and Clattenburg
