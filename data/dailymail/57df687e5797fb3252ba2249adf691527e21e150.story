Self-service checkouts have the ability to create irrational rage and frustration.

But these machines could be about to get a lot smarter – and soon it won’t be just your basket they’re checking out.

A patent for a system that can both profile customers while also catching thieves has just been filed by New York-based Symbol Technologies.

Recent research found that 
self-service tills have turned shoppers into thieves with one in five admitting they fail to pay for some items.

Shoppers
 said the most common reason for failing to pay was simply because they 
found it difficult to get the scanners to work properly.

Consequently,
 rather than spend an age trying to get the scanner to work or hunting 
around for a member of staff to help, they just put the item in their 
bag.

Some 19 per cent of shoppers said they take items every month with a typical value of £15 ($25). If these figures are correct, total losses via these tills runs to a £1.6 billion ($2.7 billion) a year.

The group, which helped develop self-scan checkouts for Tesco and Asda, is currently designing 'statistical-based' software for its smart self-scan checkout. 

The technology can determine whether the shop is in a high-crime area; the time of day; shopping history and queue length, according to a report by Sarah Knapton in the Telegraph.

All these factors are plugged into an algorithm that can determine if it is likely a shopper has stolen items. The system will only work if a shopper is identified through a store card.

It could also highlight products that are more likely to be stolen, such as batteries and razors, according to the patent. 

It is unclear how the shop assistants will be alerted to a high-risk shopper, but the group suggests it could help improve random checks 'in areas with a high risk of pilferage’ as well as on new customers.

Tesco and Asda claim they have not adapted their scanners to profile customers and are ‘unlikely to in the future.’

A separate study last year found that shoppers are abandoning their purchases in supermarkets as they become increasingly frustrated at being pushed to use self-service tills.

One in three of people has walked out of a store because of a bad experience with a self-service till, according to a study.

However, many customers disagree and find using the technology difficult, not least because they fear being accused of theft by failing to scan items correctly.

Analysts at the retail technology company Tensator said stores seem to be pushing ahead with the self-scan tills because it suits them rather than their customers.

In a survey, 84 per cent of respondents admitted to needing staff assistance when using a self-service checkout, while 60 per cent preferred using traditional staffed tills.

It works by using an algorithm that plugs in data on factors such as area safety, time of day, shopping history, customer profile and queue length

Software then alerts a shopping assistant if a customer is 'high risk'
