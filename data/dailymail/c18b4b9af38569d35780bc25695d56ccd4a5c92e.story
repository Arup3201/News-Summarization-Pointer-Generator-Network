Paris St Germain finally got into their stride in Ligue 1 when goals by Lucas and Marquinhos gave them a 2-0 win at promoted Caen.

In the absence of the injured Zlatan Ibrahmovic, who missed the game due to heel pain, the French champions dominated to move up to second in the standings with 13 points from seven games.

They trail leaders and  Marseille, who demolished Stade de Reims 5-0, by three points.

PSG, however, could face some attacking problems in the near future as Argentine forward Ezequiel Lavezzi was substituted by Jean-Christophe Bahebeck after only 10 minutes with a possible thigh injury.

Laurent Blanc’s side, who had drawn their last three games in all competitions, were never threatened by Caen and took the early lead when Brazil forward Lucas dribbled past several players before firing past Remy Vercoutre in the 18th minute.

Centre back Marquinhos made it 2-0 nine minutes into the second half with a downward header from Bahebeck’s corner kick.

Monaco forward Valere Germain scored the only goal of the game as they beat Montpellier 

Earlier, late substitute Valere Germain scored deep into injury time as Monaco continued to improve from a woeful start to the season with a 1-0 win at Montpellier.

Forward Germain, who came on for Geoffrey Kondogbia in the 88th minute, found the back of the net three minutes into added time from Layvin Kurzawa’s cross.

Leonardo Jardim’s side, without top forwards Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez after the Colombian duo left for Manchester United and Real Madrid respectively, are now 11th in the standings with 10 points from seven games.
