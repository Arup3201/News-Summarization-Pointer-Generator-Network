If you happen to live in the Pacific Northwest or the central plains, there's a good chance that you're excited about this year's Super Bowl - according to a county-by-county map of football fandom,it's likely you're either a Seattle Seahawks or Denver Broncos fan..

Facebook's Data Science team has used information gathered by the social media website to chart every county in the United States' NFL allegiance.

The results aren't all that shocking.

Geography: According to this map created using information from Facebook NFL fandom is incredibly regional

For example, according to the map, if you live in New England, chances are you're a New England Patriots fan. If you live in Texas or the lower Midwest, you're likely a Dallas Cowboys fan.

However, there are a few interesting allegiances that don't seem to make any sort of geographical sense.

Alaska, for example, appears to be a bit confused - which makes sense considering the closest NFL team is located in Seattle, which is nearly 1,500 miles away.

According to the map, Alaskans are primarily loyal to the Green Bay Packers, but there are several counties within the state that like other teams, like the San Fransisco 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

J-E-T-S Jets, Jets, Jets: The New York Jets are the only team to have but one county in the entire country backing them

Florida is a bit of an anomaly, as well.Â 

According to the map, Floridians tend to like teams from all over the country - Despite having three NFL teams of their own, there are pockets of the state that are home to Giants, Patriots, Steelers, Packers, and Bears fans.

Florida's random allegiances likely are due to the fact that the state is home to a large community of transplants, many of whom are retirees from cities all across the country - who bring their football loyalty with them.

If you're a New York Jets fan who doesn't live on Long Island, there's a good chance your Sundays feel awfully lonely - according to the map, the Jets are the only team to have the supports of just one county: Nassau, which is the western half of Long island.

Are you ready? Super Bowl XLVIII is just a few short hours away!
