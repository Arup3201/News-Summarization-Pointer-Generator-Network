It may sound like something out of science fiction but a Japanese firm plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on Earth.Â 

Shimizu Corporation's Luna Ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles around the moon's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt 250 miles wide.

Energy captured by these panels would then be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed.

Shimizu Corporation plans to install a 250-mile-wide field of solar panels on the moon's equator (concept image pictured). Energy from these panels would be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights and the company claims the system would be an 'almost inexhaustible' source of power

According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy.

The company claims the plans would not only provide an 'almost inexhaustible' energy supply, it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources.

The quest for finding alternate sources was hastened in Japan in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power station crisis in 2011.

Up until that point the country relied heavily on nuclear energy and the crisis, sparked by the tsunami in March of that year, highlighted how vulnerable and volatile it is as a source.

Shimizu Corporation hasn't yet announced a timeline for the project but it would result in the biggest public infrastructure installation ever constructed.

However, Shimizu Corporation said on its website: 'A shift from economical use of limited resources to the unlimited use of clean energy is the ultimate dream of all mankind.

'The Luna Ring, our lunar solar power generation concept, 
translates this dream into reality through ingenious ideas coupled with 
advanced space technologies.

'Virtually inexhaustible, non-polluting solar energy is the 
ultimate source of green energy that brings prosperity to nature as well
 as our lives.

Shimizu plans to cover the equator of the moon in solar panels as part of its Luna Ring project.

A field of solar panels would stretch 250 miles wide and almost 6,790 miles around the lunar surface.

Energy collected from these panels can only be sent from the near side of the moon, the side that always faces Earth. Cables fitted below these panels would be used to transfer power from the far side.

Once collected, this energy would then be transmitted to Earth using microwaves. The 13-mile-diameter microwave antennas would send the power to receiving rectennas on Earth.

A guidance beacon would be used to make sure the waves were transmitted to the correct locations.

Energy would also be sent using high-energy laser lights direct to receiving facilities.

This means the power could be sent to specific countries or precise locations, where needed.

Shimizu Corporation believes the system could provide 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy.

'Shimizu Corporation proposes the Luna Ring for the infinite coexistence of mankind and the Earth.'

The firm claims the project would eliminate inefficiency due to bad weather and fulfill all of the world's energy needs.

The plans call for astronauts to return to the moon and begin work with the help of robots that will be required to level the highly cratered surface.

It claims the soil on the moon can be used to make water, concrete, oxygen and ceramics necessary for the project.

Construction of a railway system to convey materials for maintenance would also be a feature of the project.

Panel field: The individual panels would make up a 250-miles-wide array that would stretch 6,790 miles around the lunar surface. Energy collected from these panels can only be sent from the near side of the moon. Cables fitted below these panels would be used to transfer power from the far side
