A nurse was brutally knifed to death in the street by her stalker ex-lover after she jilted him, a court heard.

After the 'remorseless' attack on 42-year-old mum-of-two Naudel Turner, Dariusz Miakienko calmly made a phone call and rolled a cigarette as he waited for police to arrive.

Married Miakienko, 47, began an affair with Mrs Turner after meeting her at the north London GP's surgery where she worked, the court heard.

As the relationship petered out he became 'obsessive' and began stalking her when she began a new relationship with practice manager Kevin McDonald, Isleworth Crown Court were told.

The jury heard her new lover even met Miakienko the day before the murder and warned Mrs Turner to call the police as he was 'dangerous.'

When the 42-year-old left work Miakienko followed her before repeatedly stabbing her in the middle of a street in Bruce Grove on March 19 of this year, it was alleged.

Peter Finnigan, prosecuting, told the jury of ten women and two men the murder took place just a short walk from where Mrs Turner worked as a practice nurse in Tottenham, north London.

He said: 'The stabbing was methodic. It was extremely violent. It was remorseless and it was prolonged.

When the 42-year-old victim left work, Miakienko followed her before repeatedly stabbing her in the middle of a street in Bruce Grove on March 19 of this year, it was alleged.

'About 1pm in the afternoon Naudel Turner left the Castle View Surgery, where she worked part-time as a practice nurse and walked a short distance to nearby Bruce Grove.

'As she was walking along the road she was seen to be followed along the road by this defendant.'

At first Mrs Turner did not acknowledge she was being followed, but witnesses said she must of been aware of it as she turned around and confronted him.

Mr Finnigan said: 'She was heard to shout to him 'leave me alone.' She then got her phone out and tried to make a phone call. The defendant grabs her arm and she turns around and slaps him.'

Miakienko then pushed her against a fence and Mr Finnigan added: 'He attacked her with a kitchen knife, he stabbed her and she fell to the ground and he continued to stab her.'

He said a passing motorist tried to intervene, adding: 'He pleaded with him to stop, shouting 'don't kill her.'

Miakienko, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham, had denied one count of murder at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court

'It didn't make any difference, he continued to stab her.'

Then, after putting down the knife, he 'took out his own mobile phone and started to make a call, and one witness saw him then rolling a cigarette.'

He was then restrained by passers-by, including an off-duty cop, until police arrived, the court heard.

Paramedics rushed to the scene, but Mrs Turner died on the way to the hospital.

Mr Finnigan said that Mrs Turner had lived with her husband, William, but they had become estranged in 2009.

However she lived on the top floor of the house while her husband live on the bottom floor, and they would not discuss each other's personal relationships.

Describing Miakienko and Mrs Turner's relationship, Mr Finnigan said: 'He had been in this country, it seems, for about five years.

'He had been treated as a patient at Castle View Surgery, where Naudel Turner worked and they formed a relationship, an intimate relationship.'

She even helped her lover rent a flat in Lordship Lane, on the same street where she worked by paying his deposit and acting as his guarantor.

Police later recovered texts and data from the man's phone after the murder which showed the relationship had soured and he had become obsessed with her.

He said: 'Members of the jury, what you might think emerges, is that he become obsessed with her. The messages can be tender and loving, and they can also be seen to be increasingly possessive and controlling.

'He believed she would leave William Turner and marry him, in fact he had a wife and children himself in Poland.'

'As time passed, Naudel's interest for a continued relationship with the defendant seemed to have lessened. In fact she met another man, Kevin McDonald.

'It's obvious that the defendant had learned about her attraction to Kevin McDonald, and didn't like it, and was jealous about it.

'He started to pester Naudel with constant calls and texts. She started to discuss him to others as a stalker.'

Mr McDonald had not known about Mrs Turner's relationship with the Pole at first, but after discovering it he had arranged to meet Miakienko.

Afterwards Mr McDonald 'told her to call the police as he believed the defendant was possibly dangerous.'

Silver-haired Miakienko was surrounded by three dock officers and was aided by a Polish interpreter.

Miakienko, 47, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham, denies one count of murder.

The trial continues.
