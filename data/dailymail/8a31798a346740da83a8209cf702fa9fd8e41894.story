Chris Robshaw has urged England to elevate recent near misses into a first piece of major silverware under Stuart Lancaster when the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title race reaches its conclusion on Saturday.

Ireland and Wales, who travel to Edinburgh and Rome respectively, are also in contention for the crown on a thrilling day of staggered kick-offs with points difference set to determine the winners.

France stand before England and their dream of improving on a trio of successive runners-up finishes and given they are playing at Twickenham, top the table by a cushion of four points and will know their victory target, the Red Rose are in the driving seat.

'All the guys are extremely excited and desperate to get that bit of silverware at the end, that significant trophy that we haven't managed to get,' Robshaw said.

'We've picked up little bits here and there, but of course we want to get the big prize at the end.

'Having gone so close in recent years has been tough for myself and the other guys involved. As a player you want to be picking up silverware.

'Unfortunately that's eluded us a couple of times. We've collected the odd bit here and there, but to finally pick up the main trophy would be great.'

Robshaw hopes England will be able to claim an even bigger prize this weekend in the Six Nations finale

Ireland prop Mike Ross admits that despite the frustration of seeing the Grand Slam dream end in Cardiff last Saturday, claiming back-to-back titles for the first time since 1949 would still provide a 'huge lift' ahead of the World Cup.

'It would be huge, it would be a huge one for us,' said Ross on the chance of retaining the title.

'It would certainly give us a huge lift going into the World Cup. It is something we really want as a squad.

'There was a lot of disappointment in that dressing room after that Welsh game because, for some lads, when is the next opportunity going to come around for a Grand Slam again? You don't know.'

Wales centre Jonathan Davies believes the Super Saturday finale of the Six Nations will be thrilling

Wales centre Jonathan Davies expects so-called Super Saturday to be a 'pretty twitchy' business.

Wales face a lunchtime appointment with Italy and could then endure the best part of a five-hour wait for the Ireland and England games to unfold before discovering if it is they who are champions.

'It's a tough ask but I think we can do it. We've reacted well in the past to certain situations like this. It's an exciting time for us,' Davies said.
