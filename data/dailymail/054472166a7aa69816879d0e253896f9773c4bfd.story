Five schools in Norway have rescheduled midterm exams to allow students to attend Justin Bieber concerts in Oslo. 

The Canadian pop star is scheduled to 
perform at the Telenor Arena in the Norwegian capital on April 16 and 17 - sparking fears that
some students in remote schools will skip midterm exams due to take 
place at the same time. 

Norway's Ministry of Education and Research confirmed today that five 
schools in the Alesund region - located some 230 miles (375 kilometers) 
northwest of Oslo - have rescheduled exams to accommodate students' wish
to attend Bieber's concerts.

Schools out: Five schools in Norway have rescheduled midterm exams to allow students to attend Justin Bieber concerts in Oslo

Minister Kristin Halvorsen says schools 
have the right to change dates for midterms exams and that the ministry 
does not intend to intervene.

The popstar has been through more than his fair share of controversy in recent weeks after being late for concert appearances, taking a pet monkey on a flight and notoriously attacking a photographer during his stint in London.

But Justin Bieber has found himself at the centre of yet more trouble after reportedly being banned from one of Vienna's biggest nightclubs amid allegations of violent behaviour from members of his entourage.

According to the Austrian Times, bodyguards smashed the cameras of fans who were enjoying themselves in Passage nightclub over the weekend, and even destroyed mobile phones in the midst of the furore surrounding the 19-year-old singer after her performed his Believe world tour in the Austrian city.

Club manager Joachim Bankel told the newspaper: 'Justin Bieber is no longer welcome here.'

Representatives for Justin Bieber declined to comment on the alleged incident when approached by MailOnline.

This is not the only time the teen idol has been banned from an exclusive nightclub, with the Boyfriend hitmaker claiming he had the 'worst birthday ever' after he was turned away from London's Cirque Du Soir when he arrived at the venue with underage friends in tow.

In February, he was snubbed by Manchester nightclub Sankeys as they didn't want him to tarnish their edgy image.

Sankeys posted on Twitter at the time: 'Yes the rumours are true, we turned Justin Bieber away. He shuffles on stage and we can’t be having that in Sankeys now can we!’

To add to his woes, Justin is now facing criminal charges after for allegedly spitting on and threatening his neighbour after a fellow resident at his posh Calabasas gated community confronted him for driving recklessly on their private roads.

It has already been a difficult year already for the teen star after dumped by his fellow popstrel and movie actress Selena Gomez, following a string of allegations he had been unfaithful.

Meanwhile, he has been late for concert dates, and was taken to hospital in London after collapsing during his run of concerts in the English capital.

Perhaps the most noteworthy incident was when he had to be held back by his own minders when he tried to get into a fistfight with photographers outside his London hotel last month.

The young star provoked more speculation over his state of mind when he took a monkey on a flight with him from LA to Munich last week, which was then seized by customs.
