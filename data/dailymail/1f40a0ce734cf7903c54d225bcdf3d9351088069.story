Lord Mandelson said Labour must spell out exactly how it would slash government spending and ‘show they mean it’ in order to win the election

Lord Mandelson said Labour must spell out exactly how it would slash government spending and ‘show they mean it’ in order to win the election.

The former Business Secretary called on individual members of the Shadow Cabinet to reveal exactly where cuts will be taking place to hammer home Labour's deficit message.

He said there was no point just leaving the hard work to Labour leader Ed Miliband and Chancellor Ed Balls as the senior ministers must ‘play as a team’.

‘What Labour is saying is that it will reduce day to day spending across government departments and it will do that year on year to reduce the percentage of borrowing,' he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show.

'But the party will also invest where we need to. That’s what Labour’s position is for this election and they need to spell it out and show that they mean it.

‘There is no point just leaving it to the two Ed’s – the shadow cabinet has got to play as a team in this. Each member must spell out exactly what this means for the departmental budget and where cuts will be taking places.’

He said the past few weeks after the Autumn Statement would be seen as a ‘defining’ moment in British politics.

‘I was surprised that the Conservatives took such a sharp step to the right. This has created an opportunity for the Labour party. Labour is in such a good position for coming election.’

When asked whether he would like to see David Miliband return to British politics, the Labour peer said: 'He has a lot to contribute wherever he is,' with a pantomime wink.

‘I have no idea what David’s plans are. Of course I’d like to see him back in British politics. He’s got a very good job that he’s doing at the moment.’

Lord Mandelson also said leaving the European Union would be an ‘extraordinary act of self-destruction’.

He joined forces with Conservative cabinet minister Ken Clarke and Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander to warn leaving the EU would be a 'historical error'.

He said the hard work should not just be left to Ed Miliband (right) and Ed Balls (left) as all Shadow Cabinet ministers should reveal where spending cuts will be coming from 

Speaking this earlier today, he said: ‘The Scottish referendum was extraordinary moment this year for the mobilisation and engagement of the whole of Scottish nation but also how people outside Britain were totally aghast at how the country would want break itself up.

‘They feel the same about Britain and the European Union – that we should rob ourselves of our influence and separate ourselves from our own home market. It strikes them such an act of self-destruction they find it difficult to know why we would contemplate it, they can hardly believe it.’

He said many voters were now looking to the marginal groups because they are ‘angry and pessimistic’.

‘But the election will be decided in the centre-ground and not on the margins,’ he said.
