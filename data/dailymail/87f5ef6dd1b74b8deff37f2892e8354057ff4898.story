Tragic: Andrew Kirkman, 20, left notes outside his tent in an Oxford meadow warning passers-by of the poisonous fumes

An Oxford University physics and philosophy student used a lethal mix of poison to kill himself inside a tent at the end of term, a coroner heard today.

Andrew Kirkman, 20, who was in his second year at Balliol College, was found dead inside the tent by a man walking with his 11-year-old son.

The pair found two A4 sheets of paper on the floor next 
to the tent door, one with a warning triangle with a
 skull, stating: 'For the police, this is a suicide attempt,' Oxford Coroner's Court heard.

The other warned: 'You should not open this tent without protective gear.'

Mr Kirkman, who went to Rickmansworth School in Hertfordshire, had been missing lectures and disclosed feeling of depression to a university chaplain and his GP, who prescribed anti-depressant.

However, the undergraduate did not to tell his parents what he was going through before his body was found at midday on December 8 last year.

That day, his mother Wendy had driven to his student accommodation in Oxford to take him back to the family's home in Northwood, north west London. He was due to catch a plane to spend Christmas with his girlfriend in Brazil the next day.

However, Mrs Kirkman spent hours waiting for him before police arrived in the afternoon to inform her of his death.

Walker Crispin Maceijewski told Oxford Coroner's Court he did not read the pages on the floor before peered inside the tent, which smelled of 'rotton eggs'.

He said: 'I opened the zip about eight to nine inches and looked inside. I immediately saw someone lying in the tent. He was lying on his back with eyes open. I said something like, "Are you all right, mate?"

Walker Crispin Maceijewski told Oxford Coroner's Court he did not read the notes on the floor before opening the tent in Port Meadow, Oxford, to check if the person inside was all right

'He was 19 or 20 years old and he was wearing clean, smart clothes. I immediately thought he was dead.'

Officials from the Chemical, 
Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Team were drafted in at midday 
after strong chemical odours were detected coming from the tent.

Within an hour all of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began their examinations.

Mr Kirkman was pronounced dead at the scene and six fume victims were taken to hospital.

His girlfriend confirmed in a phone call with police that the student once told her he fantasised about killing himself in a field in Oxford.

Pathologist Professor Ian Roberts confirmed the presence of cannabis in the young manâ€™s blood sample.

Recording a suicide verdict, Coroner Darren Salter said it had been an 'unusual case.' The cause of death was given as poisoning.

Wendy Kirkman and her tearful husband Michael sat at the front of the court with a framed photograph of Andrew on the desk.

Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Kirkman paid tribute to her son and said: 'He was a joy to be with - everything was fun when he was around.

'Andrew was an amazing young man. He spent an inordinate amount of time assisting others and was a force for good in every community he was involved in.'

She said the presence of 250 mourners at his funeral was 'testament to how many lives he touched.'

Mr Kirkman is also survived by two younger brothers, who were not at the inquest.

Sir Drummond Bone, master of Balliol College, said after the inquest: 'The College has been deeply saddened by Andrewâ€™s tragic death last December. We saw how deeply he was loved and valued at a college memorial service for him, attended by his family and many of his friends.

'Andrew was a friendly, thoughtful and kind young man who is very much missed and our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with his family.'
