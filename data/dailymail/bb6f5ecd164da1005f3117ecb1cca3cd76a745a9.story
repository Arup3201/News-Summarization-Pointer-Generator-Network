Anastassia Tepljakova, 27, of Cheltenham, was jailed for four months at Gloucester Crown Court

A driver who gave a  colleague’s name when she was caught driving without insurance did nothing when her workmate was convicted and endured four court hearings before being cleared.

Anastassia Tepljakova’s deceit was discovered only when the police officer who charged her met her workmate at court and realised it was the wrong woman.

Tepljakova, 27, of Cheltenham, was jailed for four months at Gloucester Crown Court this week after admitting perverting the course of justice by providing false details.

As a result of her lie, her colleague, Olga Jelcova, was convicted in her absence of driving without insurance and had a 15-month battle to prove her innocence.

Tepljakova said she ‘panicked’ when approached by a policeman after the car she was driving ran out of petrol in Gloucester.

She gave the name and address of Ms Jelcova, who she worked with at Laithwaite’s wine company, when the officer discovered that she had no insurance.

It led to Miss Jelcova being convicted by magistrates. When she received notice of her conviction she began an appeal and, following a number of court appearances, a new hearing was set.

Luckily, the police officer who dealt with the incident had taken a picture at the time and when he arrived to give evidence he realised that Miss Jelcova had not been the driver. She identified Tepljakova from the photo.

Jailing Estonian-born Tepljakova, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said it was bad enough that she had driven without insurance and then lied to the police.

But what made it far worse was that she had not owned up when she saw her colleague suffering as a result of her dishonesty.

‘Not only did you pretend to be this lady but you sat back and watched her suffer – and suffer she did, going to court again and again,’ he said.

In a statement, Miss Jelcova said it had taken 15 months to clear her name and it had been ‘extemely stressful.’ ‘I cannot believe someone would do this to me,’ she said.
