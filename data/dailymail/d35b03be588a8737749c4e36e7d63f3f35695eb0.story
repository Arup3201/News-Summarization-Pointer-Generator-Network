The Body Shop and Lush have been criticised for implying some cosmetics are still tested on animals.

Understanding Animal Research, which represents medical scientists, claimed the high street shops still use ethical claims to market cosmetics – despite the fact all make-up sold in Britain is now cruelty-free.

Since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and toiletries in the EU which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world.

False marketing ploy: The Body Shop and Lush both market their products as 'non animal tested', however this is no different to any other cosmetic brand in the UK as animal testing is forbidden in the EU

Lush defended its ‘ethical’ language saying it upholds the highest standards, while The Body Shop said it continues to push for a worldwide ban.

Wendy Jarrett, chief executive of Understanding Animal Research, which represents more than 100 universities, drug companies and charities, said that the animal testing of beauty products has long been banned in Britain.

And since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and personal care products such as shampoo and shower gel tested on animals anywhere in the world.

She said: ‘I think the fact that there are still cosmetics being sold in this country under the cruelty-free banner is appalling because that allows people to think that there are other products out there that have been tested on animals.

‘You can’t go to any country in the EU and buy a cosmetic product that has been tested on animals.  You just can’t do it. So, it’s really disingenuous of them to maintain this cruelty-free banner.’

Cause: Lush hosted an 'animal testing reenactment' in a London store in 2012 to spearhead a campaign to end cosmetic testing on animals

The Body Shop clearly labels many of its products with the words ‘against animal testing’ and its website highlights some of its ‘iconic cruelty-free products’.

Lush proclaims it is ‘fighting animal testing’, while products made by many smaller companies display a Leaping Bunny logo awarded by Cruelty Free International.

Mrs Jarrett said that a recent poll for Understanding Animal Research found that just a third of people know about the cosmetics ban.

She applauded the likes of Lush and the Body Shop for their part in driving through the sales ban – but asked why the slogans and emblems are still being used more than a year later.

She questioned whether they fear sales will go down if they lose the selling point that made them stand out from other stores and said: ‘We still see various logos about being against animal testing.  No doubt it is true that they are against animal testing but so is everybody.

‘You can’t by law sell products tested on animals.

‘I take my hat off to Lush and the Body Shop for doing the work to get the ban in.  I am in no way an apologist for cosmetic research but the time has come to be open with the public about the fact that cosmetic testing on animals doesn’t happen anymore.’

Banned: Since 2013, it has been illegal to sell make-up and toiletries in the EU which have been tested on animals anywhere in the world

Mrs Jarrett made her remarks at the launch of an agreement pledging more openness in animal experiments for medical research – which is still allowed by law.

More than 70 companies, research institutes and charities have signed a concordat that aims to remove the secrecy surrounding the topic could see medical research labs open their doors to the public.

Mrs Jarrett said that perpetuating the idea that cosmetics are being tested on animals could undermine the public’s acceptance of medical research aimed at finding cures and treatments for disease.

She said: ‘I think it does muddy it because we know that people still think that when we talk about animal research, we are taking about rabbits’ eyes and shampoo’.

Lush defended its use of cruelty-free language.  It said it goes further than the law by not dealing with companies that test anything on animals anywhere in the world.

This includes firms that test new foods or drugs on animals.

Hilary Jones, Lush’s ethics director, said: ‘We try not to pass our money and our customers’ money on to companies that do animal testing.’

Cruelty Free International also said its criteria are more stringent than the EU’s.

A spokesman for the Body Shop said: ‘Whilst the ban in Europe is a great milestone, animal testing on cosmetics products and ingredients continues to take place in other countries around the world.  

‘As an international brand, we support our partner organisation Cruelty Free International in calling for a complete international ban and continue to feature Against Animal Testing on all our products as part of our long standing commitment to this issue.’
