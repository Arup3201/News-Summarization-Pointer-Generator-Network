Brazilian health and safety officials have raided the England and Italy team hotels for next month's World Cup and confiscated fish, butter, ham and other food past their sell-by dates.

More than 50 kilograms of food deemed unfit for consumption was taken from the Portobello Hotel where Italy will stay and another 2kg was removed from England's Hotel Royal Tulip. Both hotels are in Rio de Janeiro.

As part of a wider campaign by the 'State Secretariat for the Defense and Protection of Consumers', officials visited 13 restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, shops and hotels, and notified eight of them for irregularities.

'In total, 218kg of food unfit for consumption was discarded,' the Secretariat said in a statement.

One of the biggest raids came on Monday at Italy's hotel in Mangaratiba, just outside the city of Rio. Officials there discovered 25kg of seafood and margarine past the sell by date, and another 24kg of meat, sauces, cheese and sugar that had no visible sell-by date.

They also removed 2.6kg of salmon, parma ham and butter after visiting England's hotel.

Both hotels were also warned for not providing condoms to guests, as is required under Brazilian law.

Agents also visited the Hotel Caesar Park where the Netherlands squad will be based but found no irregularities there.

Food for thought: England head chef Tim De'Ath will be preparing England's meals at the World Cup

Thirty-two teams will take part in the World Cup next month, the first to be held in Brazil since 1950. 

Many of them, including England, will bring their own food and their own cooks.Tim De'Ath, who has worked in the kitchens for Hollywood stars and at West Ham Unted, is England's head chef.

The build-up to the World Cup is being overshadowed by safety fears for the teams heading to Brazil this summer.

Chief among the concerns is the level of crime and violence in Rio’s gang-ridden shanty towns, or favelas, the largest of which, Rocinha, is near England’s hotel.

There are serious question marks over the FA’s decision to base themselves in central Rio. England’s hotel, the ageing Royal Tulip, is rated by travel website TripAdvisor as only the 93rd best in the city.

Only one other team – Holland, who will train much closer to their hotel – are based in the city, while Germany have built their own private beach resort to stay in.

The host cities for England’s first games – Manaus, Sao Paolo and Belo Horizonte – are plagued by robberies, murders and muggings.
