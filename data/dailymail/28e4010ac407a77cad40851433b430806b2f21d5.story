Substitute teacher Micheal Vivanco was arrested for alleged lewd behavior with a 13-year-old

A substitute teacher at Felix Varela Senior High School in Maimi was arrested on Friday for alleged lewd acts with a 13-year-old.

He was apprehended and taken to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Facility in Miami-Dade.

22-year-old Michael Vivanco met the victim on a mobile dating site called Jack'd.

Jack'd is an app designed for gay men to locate other men looking to meet up in their local area. The app requires those who register to be 18-years-old or older.

Whether or not the victim revealed his real age on the app is not disclosed.

NBC Miami reports that the pair exchanged numbers and texted inappropriate messages to each other.

According to the police report, in one text message Vivanco wrote, 'show me your body :).'

Vivanco later picked up the victim in his car, drove him to a deserted area, and the victim allegedly performed oral sex on him.

Vivanco admitted to police that he met the victim online and that he knew he was minor.

CBS reports that he is facing one count of Lewd and Lascivious Battery, one count of Lewd and Lascivious Conduct, and two counts of Transmission of Harmful Material to a Minor. 

Vivanco spent time around children as he was a boys and girls volleyball coach at Varela. The school was unavailable to comment.
