A KBR contract worker who claims she was drugged and brutally raped while working in Iraq has been ordered to pay $145,000 of the company's court costs after she lost her lawsuit.

A federal jury in Houston ruled against Jamie Leigh Jones after her civil trial in July.

KBR had asked U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison to award $2million in legal fees and court costs against Miss Jones, but Ellison approved only the court costs on Monday.

The Houston Chronicle reports Ellison ruled that while Miss Jones' lawsuit was flawed, it was not frivolous as KBR alleged.

Miss Jones' attorney, Todd Jones of Houston, had not returned requests for comment at press time.

He had previously called KBR's request 'shameful'.

It was almost six years after the 
event that Miss Jones told jurors she was 'scared to death' and held 
against her will by her employer after being sexually assaulted in Iraq 
at the hands of co-workers.

The 26-year-old, from Texas, is 
one of several female contract workers for KBR and its former parent 
Halliburton Co who claim they were sexually assaulted or harassed while 
working for the companies in Iraq.

Miss Jones said that while she was
a clerical worker at Camp Hope in Baghdad in 2005, she was raped so 
violently her breast implants were ruptured, her pectoral muscles were 
torn and she was severely bruised.

When she reported the rape to KBR 
officials, she said they placed her under armed guard, held her in a 
shipping container for hours and wouldn't allow her to make a phone 
call.

She claims she eventually managed 
to escape the ordeal by convincing one of the guards to let her use his 
phone, which she used to call her father in the United States.

After the ordeal she had to have two breast operations and hundreds of sessions with a psychiatrist, according to her testimony.

In court, Miss Jones said her 
chest was so disfigured after the incident she needed two reconstructive
breast operations - with the first unsuccessful.

She became depressed after the attack and developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, she said.

'I was excited to get the memory 
of Baghdad off of me,' Jones said of the plastic surgery. 'Yes, I could 
cover it up (with clothing)… but why do I have to be constantly reminded
of it?'

Miss Jones sued KBR, Halliburton and a former KBR firefighter she says was one of her rapists, all of whom deny her allegations.

During her often tearful 
testimony, Miss Jones said she had been drinking with a group of KBR 
firefighters outside her barracks before she was raped.

'One of the firefighters, he 
handed me the drink. He said: "Don't worry I saved all the ruffies for 
Dubai,"' Miss Jones testified.

She said she was drugged with what
she believes was the sedative Rohypnol, widely known as a date-rape 
drug and also known by the nickname 'ruffies'.

Miss Jones said she woke up the 
next morning in her room and discovered she was naked, sore and had 
bruises and scratches on her thighs and wrists.

She said he had no memory of what 
happened to her. She said she found Charles Bortz in the room with her 
and he told her that they had had sex the night before.

'I was putting the pieces together. I was figuring it out. I knew I had been raped,' Miss Jones said.

According to the lawsuit: 'When 
she awoke the next morning still affected by the drug, she found her 
body naked and severely bruised, with lacerations, blood running down 
her leg, her breast implants ruptured, and her pectoral muscles torn – 
which would later require reconstructive surgery.'

Miss Jones told jurors that after 
getting dressed and reporting for work, she realised what had happened 
to her and had a friend take her to get medical treatment.

After being examined by a military
doctor, several KBR officials were crass towards her and tried to bully
her into giving a statement about what happened, she claimed.

Her account was confirmed by U.S. 
Army physician Jodi Schultz, who gave the rape kit she used to gather 
evidence from Miss Jones to KBR security forces.

The rape kit later disappeared and
was recovered two years later, but missing crucial photographs and 
notes, according to the Guardian.

Jones said she eventually 
contacted her father, who called U.S. Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, 
who helped to secure her release.

KBR and Halliburton had contended 
Miss Jones' case should be settled through arbitration as stipulated in 
her contract. But an appeals court let her lawsuit go to trial.

Due in part to Miss Jones' case, 
federal lawmakers in 2009 approved a measure prohibiting contractors and
subcontractors that receive $1million in funds from the Department of 
Defense from requiring employees to resolve sexual assault allegations 
and other claims through arbitration.
