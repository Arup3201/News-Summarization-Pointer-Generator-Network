Scrounger: Kevin Stephenson, 53, stole the highest rate of disability benefits for four years while working as a lorry driver

A trucker milked nearly £24,000 in disability benefits by pretending to need a carer - despite spending 55 hours a week driving HGVs, a court heard.

Kevin Stephenson, 53, from Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, stole taxpayers' money while working five days a week at a successful haulage firm, Alloa Sheriff Court was told.

Over four years, he claimed the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions and said he needed a wheelchair.

But in August 2012, he was working as a 
HGV lorry driver with Clackmannanshire-based Gogar Logistics.

Prosecutor Lindsey Brooks told the court how Stephenson claimed he 'needed assistance with functions on a daily basis'.

However an investigation was launched after witnesses reported that he had been employed by a recruitment agency.

The depute fiscal said: 'He arrived at work by car and walked 200 yards to the site. He was not off sick at any period of time.

'He used to drive vehicles delivering goods, containers, and timber.'

Mrs Brooks said a witness from the company said that a substantial level of physical fitness was needed in order to carry out the job. 

The fiscal added: 'He still suffers from multiple sclerosis but has not had a relapse in four years.

'He may have been entitled to some benefits, but the exact amount cannot be calculated.'

Stephenson pleaded guilty to obtaining £23,950 disability living allowance by fraud between June 2009 and June 2013.

Robert Smith, defending, said: 'Mr Stephenson had a significant relapse when he made an application for disability allowance and up until 2009 he continued to have relapses.

'As far as Mr Stephenson is concerned, he will have Multiple Sclerosis for the rest of his life - he still suffers from the disease and will continue to do so.

'Even though he was suffering Multiple Sclerosis symptoms, he soldiered on.'

He added that Stephenson accepted that for substantial periods of time he was not eligible for benefits.

Mr Smith said he also suffers from depression, and currently lives alone.

Convicted: Stephenson pleaded guilty to taking nearly £24,000 worth of disability benefits at Alloa Sheriff Court (right) and was given 225 hours of unpaid work

The court heard that deductions were already being made from his benefits.

Stephenson was sentenced to 225 hours of unpaid work, and made subject to a restriction of liberty order for three months.

Sheriff David Mackie told him he had committed an offence that often led to imprisonment.

He said: 'I am not going to impose a custodial sentence.

'I accept that you have grave health issues and have taken into account that many of your health complications are caused by stress.'
