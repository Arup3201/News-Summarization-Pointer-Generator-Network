A veteran newspaper journalist has found out that after 38 years in the job... he’s allergic to newspaper ink.

Baltimore Sun politics reporter Michael Dresser said ‘the irony just overwhelms anything else’.

Mr Dresser had been having eye and skin trouble for a long time and doctors told him that the underlying cause was the pine resin used in newspaper ink.

He told The Wall Street Journal: ‘People have been more amused than sympathetic. The irony just overwhelms anything else.’

Mr Dresser wrote a memo to his colleagues telling them that he will have to wear rubber gloves around the office.

‘I make this public… so that I can limit the number of times I have to explain my apparent weirdness,’ he wrote.

Change of habit: The journalist has always been fiercely devoted to the printed page, but expressed his relief that the Balitmore Sun is also available in a digital edition

He said: ‘The next time you see me in the newsroom, you may see me wearing the type of rubber gloves used by a doctor or a crime scene technician.

‘Don’t worry, I won’t be administering any uncomfortable examinations or looking for blood spatter. It’s just that I found out this week after nearly 38 years at The Sun that I am allergic to newspaper ink.'

He also explained that he will have to avoid dark clothing, as it uses a dye that also causes him irritation.
