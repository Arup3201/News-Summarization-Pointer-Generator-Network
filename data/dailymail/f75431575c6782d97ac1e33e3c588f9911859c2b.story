Medals posthumously awarded to a 13-year-old boy who was one of the youngest victims of the First World War have sold for £1,000 at auction.

Sydney Cawsey died alongside his father John, 39, after their Merchant Navy vessel was shelled on March 12, 1917.

The Devon teenager worked as a cook on a 172 tonne wooden schooner called the S.V. Reward, which was mastered by his father John Carter Cawsey.

Medals: The medals awarded posthumously to Sydney Cawsey have sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for £1,000

The father and son were 
part of a crew transporting troops and coal from Falmouth in Devon to 
Guernsey when they came under heavy fire from a a German UC-72 
submarine.

Sydney 
received the British War Medal and Mercantile Marine War Medal 
posthumously, becoming one of the youngest ever recipients of the 
awards.

Yesterday the 
pair of medals sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for £1,000 at an 
auction in Hazel Grove, Cheshire - beating its estimated sale price of 
between £600 and £800.

Medals
Expert Andrew McCann, from Maxwells Auctioneers, who handled the sale, 
said: 'It really was quite a special piece because of the fascinating 
back story and I think that is what generated the interest.

'It is very rare to get this much for such normal medals that would have been widely dished out among ordinary seamen.

'They don't really tell the full story of the boy's bravery.

'The
boys age meant there was a lot of interest in the lot and they 
eventually went to a private collector who bid by telephone,' he added.

Sydney
was among 10 other boys aged under 15 who served in the Merchant Navy 
during the Great War, and one of only a handful who were killed in 
action.

His father gained the Torpedo Badge medal, which he was posthumously awarded for his service on a different vessel.

Figures show 14,287 British merchant navy sailors died during World War One.

The deadly German UC-72 submarine downed 38 ships during the war using a deadly combination of torpedoes and mines.

Mr McCann added: 'Only a handful of boys Sydney's age would have served in the Merchant Navy.

'There has been some confusion over his age, because his descendants who gave us the lot believed him to be 15.

'But records in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission show him to be 14.

'However,
when we dug further we saw that the 1911 census put his birth year as 
1904, which would make him 13 years and nine months old - one of the 
youngest sailors in the war.

'The
fact he died with his father makes it such a poignant story, because in
all my years of historical study we have never encountered a similar 
instance.'

Sydney and 
John were sailing with ship's mate John Mactaggart Taylor, Dubliner 
Andrew McLoughlin, and Edward Campbell, who was born in Barbados.

Despite
the risk of attack from enemy submarines John's wife Mary Anne and his 
daughter would sometimes accompany them on their trips up and down the 
channel.

Remembrance: Both father and son are remembered on a war memorial in Appledore, Devon

Tragedy: The posthumous medals awarded to father and son are seen side by side

The Cawsey family experienced a huge amount of tragedy in the early 1900s.

Sydney's older brother, who shared his name, died in his infancy and another brother died at sea when he was just three-years-old.

John Carter Cawsey and Sydney Cawsey are both commemorated on the Merchant Navy Monument at Tower Hill, London.

Their names are also recorded on the war memorial in their home town of Appledore, North Devon.
