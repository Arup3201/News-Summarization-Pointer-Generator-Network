Staff at Britain's biggest motor insurer face massive job cuts in a new round of cost-cutting.

Direct Line Group, which owns Churchill among other brands, will see around 2,000 positions slashed after the insurance giant revealed plans to more than double its original money saving target.

The job cuts - representing about 14 per cent of its 14,400-strong workforce - come as Direct Line announced plans to cut costs by more than £200m by 2014.

Insurer Direct Line has announced it will cut around 2,000 jobs in a new drive to more than double cost-savings

Last year the firm announced plans to save costs of up to £100m by 2014, and it has already axed 1,200 jobs since last August under the money-saving plans.

Direct Line said staff across head office and support functions were expected to go in the latest round of redundancies.

But the group said it hoped to redeploy staff where possible, and find opportunities for affected workers with other potential employers.

It has 16 sites across the UK, including offices in central London, Croydon, Bromley, Leeds, Glasgow and Manchester.

But the group is shutting its Teesside call centre over the next week, as previously announced, and it is understood another site is at risk of closure under the latest move to slash costs.

Paul Geddes, chief executive of Direct Line Group, said the firm had 'not made these proposed changes lightly'.

He added: 'As we have done in the past, we will deal fairly and carefully with those impacted, and do all we can to support them through these changes.'

Direct Line, which was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) when it floated on the stock market last year, recently revealed a £94.3m profits haul for the first three months of 2013 - up 47 per cent on a year earlier thanks to cost savings and unusually low weather-related claims.

But the group, which also owns brands including Green Flag and Privilege, saw gross premiums fall 4.5 per cent during the quarter to about £1 billion as it refused to get drawn into a price war in the fiercely competitive motor insurance market.

Taxpayer-backed RBS floated Direct Line to appease European Union rules on state aid.  RBS still owns 48.5% of the insurer but must sell its entire stake by the end of 2014.
