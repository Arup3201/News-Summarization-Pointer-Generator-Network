It may be the last regular event of the European Tour year but for some players the ISPS HANDA Perth International is all about comebacks - in more ways than one.

American Jason Dufner plays his first competitive golf in three months after injury ruled him out of his US PGA defence, the FedEx Cup and the Ryder Cup but for others the focus is on ensuring they make appearances next season.

With only the top 78 in The Race to Dubai rankings going through to the final series of four tournaments, this event is the last chance for players to secure a place in that. More important for others is to secure their cards, as come Sunday the top 111 players on the list will retain their playing privileges for the 2015 European Tour season.

Manchester's Matthew Nixon currently occupies the last available place - courtesy of Zimbabwe's 66th-placed Brendon de Jonge being only an affiliate member so he is not included in the top 110 cut-off.

The 25-year-old has made the cut in his last three events and needs to do so again to consolidate his position while former European Tour winners Irishman Peter Lawrie (174th) and Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalo (131st) have to perform much better.

Dufner, one of three major champions in the field alongside Charl Schwartzel and Geoff Ogilvy, committed to the event at Lake Karrinyup back in May and so did not want to let down organisers after his shoulder and neck problems.

Dufner celebrates on the 18th green after his two-stroke victory at the 95th PGA Golf Championship in 2013 

'It it has been about 11 weeks since I last played so it is getting better,' he told European Tour Radio.

'It was frustrating to miss the last major, the play-offs and Ryder Cup but in the end it was probably nice to do it.

'It was nice to get my fitness and health better and I worked on one of my weaknesses which was my putting.

'I've had a couple of weeks with no pain swinging the golf club and they have told me I can't do more damage.'

Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, who was a member of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team, is among the favourites this week.

'It's better to be one of the favourites but I will just try to do my best,' said the 24-year-old.

'There are a lot of good players. Jason, Charl, and also some players who played a lot in the States and are just at the limit of qualifying for the Final Series and this is the last tournament before that.'
