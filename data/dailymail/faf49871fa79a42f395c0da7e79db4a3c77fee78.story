Bosses at the BBC were told three years ago that a doomed IT project – axed only after wasting £100million - was heading for trouble.

It emerged yesterday that a whistle-blower warned managers in 2010 that the supposed £95.4million ‘benefit’ from the project was ‘hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver’.

The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers doing away with the need for video or audio tapes.

But the corporation announced that they were dropping the failed technology project nearly two weeks ago after frittering away almost £100 million of licence-fee payers money.

Reports have also suggested it had delivered no savings at all to the corporation.

The BBC’s chief finance officer Zarin Patel and a member of the BBC Trust Anthony Fry are to face the Public Accounts Committee on Monday, where they are expected to be grilled about the debacle.

Earlier this week it was revealed that BBC chairman Lord Patten was warned a year ago about problems by former senior BBC manager, Bill Garrett, who was head of technology in the corporation’s programme-making department until 2010.

He wrote to Lord Patten in May last year to warn him about ‘serious concerns’ over the cost of the DMI and that there was a risk that the National Audit Office – the government’s spending watchdog - may have been misled about the project.

But further details of Mr Garrett’s correspondence with Lord Patten reveal he raised his concerns about the project to BBC management back in 2010.

In particular he questioned the financial projections the BBC was making to back the continuation of the project, after the corporation took over running of it after previous deal with technology company Siemens was brought to an end in 2009.

When Mr Garrett looked at the figures, he told Patten in his letter, it had been ‘professionally difficult for me not to question the value proposition of the revised investment case.

‘I believed the stated benefits to be hugely overoptimistic and difficult to deliver, accordingly I made my concerns clear to BBC management.’ 

Lord Patten is said to have passed the concerns on to a colleague at the corporation’s governing body, who had responded by saying there were ‘no plans to carry out a further review’ of the project.

However trustee Mr Fry did write to Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge last year to tell her he was ‘not content’ with progress on the project.

There is growing concern that elements at the broadcaster had failed to make clear the scale of the trouble the project was in.

The BBC Trust is thought to be very interested in discovering why it was not told by executives earlier about the problems.

The governing body was said to have been ‘shocked’ when it learned about the scale of the disaster, following a report last month.

Hearing that Mr Garrett had raised the matter with bosses back in 2010 will no doubt be of interest to them.

MPs have accused Lord Patten of ‘lurching from one crisis to another’ and being ‘asleep at the wheel’.

Politicians branded the wasted money an ‘outrage’ when the corporation announced its closure about two weeks ago. It’s chief technology officer, John Linwood, has been suspended as a review is conducted into what went wrong.

At the end of last month new director general Lord Hall finally abandoned the technological overhaul.

He had admitted that the initiative ‘wasted a huge amount of licence-fee payers money.’ He said he had concerns about how the project had been run and a review had been ordered to find out what went wrong.

Lord Patten was said to have personally replied to Mr Garrett earlier this week, apparently after the trust was informed the former BBC man had let MPs know about his letters.

The BBC chairman is thought to have told him that his concerns, along with others, had led the Trust to ‘seek further information’ from the corporation’s management in the summer last year.
