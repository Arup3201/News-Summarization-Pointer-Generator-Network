A 22-year-old footballer's girlfriend has died just months after their premature baby daughter passed away. 

Gemma Porteous, 22, the girlfriend of Cowdenbeath FC player Dean Brett, died of spinal cancer on Tuesday.

She was diagnosed with cancer shortly after giving birth to twins Mollie and Mia three months early on June 2.

Mr Brett, who lives in Tranent, East Lothian, posted a heartbreaking message on Facebook informing family and friends of his loss.

He wrote: 'For the people who don't know, Gemma passed away earlier today, sorry to tell it like this but it's easier!

'I just really want to say how proud I am of my best friend and that I will always love her! Thanks for a brilliant 6 years, 2 amazing daughters and everything you have done for me!! 

'I miss you already but I know you will be having fun with Mollie.. Sweet dreams Gem and I promise I will take good care of Mia xxxxxx.'

He later wrote on Twitter:  'Thanks to everyone for your support! Means a lot to me to have so many people who care! I'll be back to making awful jokes in no time.'

Mr Brett paid tribute to his girlfriend on Twitter - the 22-year-old died of spinal cancer on Tuesday 

On Facebook, he said: 'I just really want to say how proud I am of my best friend and that I will always love her! Thanks for a brilliant 6 years, 2 amazing daughters and everything you have done for me!!'

On Twitter, Mr Brett thanked his friends for their messages for the support following the loss of his girlfriend

It is understood Ms Porteous was told she had cancer and started treatment weeks after daughter Mollie passed away.  

Baby Mia was born at 1.30am on June 2 and weighed just 3lbs while Mollie was born twenty minutes later at 1.50am weighing just under 2lb. 

The tot struggled to gain weight and died after falling sick. 

Last night, Alex Anderson, secretary of the Scottish Championship club said everyone at Cowdenbeath would help Mr Brett cope with his double loss.

Mr Anderson said: 'There is not a lot anyone can say which will be of much comfort to the laddie, apart from telling him that he is part of the Cowdenbeath family and as one of ours we will do everything we can to support him.

'Dean has been off on compassionate leave for the last few months. He and Gemma lost the wee one and now this has happened, so the boy needs us all to stick by him.'
