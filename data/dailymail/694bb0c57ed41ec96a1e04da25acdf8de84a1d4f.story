A spill from her toilet has led to Isabela O'Sullivan getting $35,000 in compensation for her pain.

The 61-year-old Dubliner was so frightened by a falling tile while she was sitting on the toilet that she fell forwards and hurt her right knee.

Just a few weeks before the September 2011 accident, O'Sullivan's bathroom had been re-done after a fire.  

Dubliner Isabela O'Sullivan was so frightened by a falling tile while she was sitting on the toilet (not pictured) that she fell forwards and hurt her right knee.

She said she was so badly injured she lay on the floor several minutes before  calling a friend for help.

Since the accident, she claims to have needed regular visits to a doctor, eventually requiring physiotherapy. 

X-rays revealed a degenerative condition in her knee. 

The Independent reports that she sued contractor Neil Kelly, who was hired by the insurance company to do the re-tile.

Kelly in turn contracted the job out to another tiler and thereby denied any liability for shoddy work.

He also called O'Sullivan's claim fraudulent, and that she had pulled the tile from the wall when she found not enough was ordered.

But forensic engineer Barry Tennyson sided with O'Sullivan, saying he found 'poor workmanship' and that an improper adhesive had been likely been applied.

The judge also sided with O'Sullivan. 

Along with the $35,000, she was given another $4,000 to replace the tile work.
