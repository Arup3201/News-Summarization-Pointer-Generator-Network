A sudden fire that erupted this afternoon at Six Flags Magic Mountain has collapsed one of the park's famed roller coasters, tearing away a section of track.

Los Angeles County firefighters were called to the park in Santa Clarita, California at around 1:30 pm Monday after the wooden coaster Colossus became engulfed in flames.

Luckily, the coaster had been shut down since last month and no injuries have been reported, according to KTLA.

Collapse: A section of track and supports crumbled and collapsed after an earlier fire burned away a portion of the wooden coaster

Emergency response: Firefighters contained the blaze and no casualties were reported among the crew working on the renovation of the wooden coaster

The fire was sparked by welders working on the ride, which is under reconstruction.

Aerial coverage showed emergency responders extinguishing the fire around 1:50 pm, just about thirty minutes after it started.

Though the blaze was easily controlled, a section of track on a life hill gave way soon after, tearing a hole along a crest of the wooden coaster. 

The park  was closed at the time of the blaze.

“It’s not something you see every day,” L.A. County Fire Inspector Scott Miller told the Los Angeles Times.

Colossus was the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster when it opened in 1978, at 125 feet tall and 62 mph.

The ride is currently in the process of being taken down and replaced with a new, updated coaster, Twisted Colossus.

The amusement park announced less than two weeks ago it would turn the roller coaster into a wood and steel hybrid, with inverted loops added to the existing wooden structure.

The plans for the overhaul include removing over 3,000 feet of track to accommodate the new sections.

Fire inspector Miller told the Los Angeles Times that further collapse of the coaster did not appear likely.
