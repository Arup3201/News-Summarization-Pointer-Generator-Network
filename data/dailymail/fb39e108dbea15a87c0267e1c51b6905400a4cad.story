It is well known that Africa is a continent of wild contrasts - from the vast plains with countless types of flora and fauna to the harsh conditions of the arid deserts where only the most hardy can survive.

Together they provide the perfect backdrop for this stunning set of images put together by wildlife photographer Heinrich van den Berg.

Some creatures do their best to stay hidden - such as the incredibly well-camouflaged Gaboon viper and leaf-tailed gecko.Â

While others parade proudly in their domain such as the lion licking its paw or the crocodile staring menacingly from the surface of murky waters.

Mr van den Berg battled his way
 through his native South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Rwanda and 
Madagascar in order to capture enough images to publish his new 
collection entitled Art of Nature.

The
 41-year-old said he also learned some lessons about the power of the 
natural world after being bitten by a mosquito - and almost died from malaria.

After recovering he was then confronted by a hippo during a canoe trip while on a safari.

But the former civil engineer pulled through the drama to make sure he finished his book.

Taken over a number of years, the collection includes a chameleon sticking its tongue out, a lion licking its paw and an incredibly well-camouflaged Gaboon Adder hidden among leaves.

Mr van den berg, who estimates just one image in every 1000 he took made it into the book, said: 'It is sometimes the most trivial animal that can be the most dangerous.

'A tiny mosquito almost took my life, which was by far the most dangerous encounter I had.

'The images for the book were taken over many years. You cannot go out to photograph specifically for this kind of book. Artistic images come with time.'

'The leaf-tailed gecko on the tree was difficult to find. They are exceptionally hard to spot on the trees of Madagascar, but fortunately I had a good guide who easily spotted them.'

He added: 'After doing a few books focusing on animal behaviour, I decided to do a book with images only focusing on beauty and the elements of art

'It is difficult to estimate the miles, but if I had known how long it would take to get these images, I would probably not have attempted the project in the first place.

'In total I visited five countries. But some of these have worlds inside them when it comes to wildlife photography opportunities.'
