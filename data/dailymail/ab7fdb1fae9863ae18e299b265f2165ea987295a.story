Gay marriage is set to be allowed in churches and other religious buildings, it emerged Friday.The Government will reveal plans next week to allow faith groups in England and Wales to 'opt in' if they want to host same-sex weddings.

The move is a dramatic extension of the Coalition’s plans to allow same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies.

The proposal to legalise gay marriage has been fiercely opposed by some senior church figures and scores of Tory MPs.

Prime Minister David Cameron insisted churches would not be forced to hold gay weddings, while on a visit to Lear Corporation in Redditch, Worcestershire

But that hasn’t stopped David Cameron from supporting it. MPs will have a free vote on a Bill next year.

The PM, speaking on a visit to Redditch, Worcestershire, Friday, said: 'Look, I’m in favour of gay marriage because I’m a massive supporter of marriage and I don’t want gay people to be excluded from a great institution.

'But let me be absolutely 100 per cent clear: if there is any church or any synagogue or any mosque that doesn’t want to have a gay marriage, it will not – it absolutely must not – be forced to hold it.

'That is absolutely clear in the legislation. And also let me make clear: this is a free vote for Members of Parliament, but personally I will be supporting it.'

The dramatic move has prompted immediate controversy.

Anti-reform campaigners said that whatever was intended by the legislation, its introduction would only increase pressure on churches opposed to same-sex ceremonies to perform them.

The PM has said that religious groups can choose whether to host same-sex weddings

Some Tories said the move would 'outrage millions'. Labour leader Ed Miliband has been pushing the Government to extend their plans to allow those religious groups which want to offer gay weddings to do so, as well as civil venues.

Nick Clegg is also understood to have been pushing behind the scenes for the legislation, expected to be published in the New Year, to be widened in scope.

Mr Clegg said: 'I’m a supporter and always have been of same-sex marriage, because I think marriage is a wonderful thing, a wonderful institution.

'It’s very important to remember that in our plans we’re not going to force any church or any religious denomination to hold same-sex marriage ceremonies if they don’t want to.'

The Government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than on any other issue.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller will set out the plans next week, promising legal 'locks' to protect churches opposed to the idea of gay marriage

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the government would not force force any church to hold same sex marriage ceremonies if they do not want to

Culture Secretary Maria Miller is 
expected to respond to the consultation by setting out the Government’s 
plans in detail next week.

Sources said the unexpected move was 
necessary to make a promised protection from legal challenge for 
religious organisations which oppose gay marriage watertight.

Government legal advisers claimed 
that the opt-in clause was necessary to prevent the European courts 
over-ruling any clause in the Bill to protect those who object. But 
critics are sceptical that this will make any difference.

Civil partnerships, introduced in 
2005, already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples. 
But the Government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage 
vows.

Ministers have vowed to protect 
churches and other religious groups who object, insisting that the 
legislation will be framed in a way to address claims from opponents 
that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil 
weddings are allowed because of human rights laws.

Last month it emerged that 118 out of
 303 Tory MPs had written to constituents indicating differing degrees 
of unease at the policy. Last night another seven joined their ranks. 
Michael Fallon, the business minister, told the Coalition for Marriage 
campaign group he was 'strongly minded' to oppose it and his 
constituents were 'overwhelmingly against' changing the law.

Several other ministers are among those expected to abstain or vote against in a free vote.
Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage, said: 'The decision to press 
ahead with the profoundly undemocratic proposals to rewrite the 
traditional meaning of marriage is deeply disappointing and regrettable.

'The PM has gone back on his promises
 that churches will be protected. The suggestion that by creating an 
"opt in system" you somehow prevent churches, mosques and synagogues 
being sued is risible. This is now made much more likely.

'Any legislation that the PM proposes
 will be subject to the European courts, who according to legal experts 
will find against the Government and those religious institutions who 
end up in the dock. So the PM is writing a cheque that he knows will 
bounce.'

Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey added: 'I’m dismayed that the Government is seeking to fast-track this legislation.

'First we had a consultation that was
 nothing of the kind and now we have this further attempt to expedite 
the legislation for short-term party political advantage.

'We should expect politicians to act 
with greater wisdom and statesmanship when contemplating such 
far-reaching cultural and social changes.'
