Jose Mourinho relishes the pre-match press conference. For the Chelsea manager, it's where the game begins, especially ahead of a match like Sunday's at Arsenal, where his side could move three points away from securing the Premier League with a victory.

It was a surprise, therefore, to see him stumped at a question posed to him at the end of his media conference on Friday. Rarely, if ever, does the Portuguese coach not know what to say.

But after going to great lengths to insist there are 'no problems' with Arsene Wenger after the pair clashed on the sidelines at Stamford Bridge last season, Mourinho was stumped by the question that followed.

Jose Mourinho was visibly surprised by a question he was asked at his Chelsea press conference

He was asked how hard Arsene Wenger pushed him, referring both to the title race and their clash last year

Mourinho praised the 'top question' before composing himself and giving an equally ambiguous answer

'Jose, you said you've been pushed very hard this season, how hard did Arsene Wenger push you?'

Mourinho burst into laughter, covered his mouth in shock before turning to Chelsea's media officer, swearing and saying 'it deserves a proper answer.'

He eventually regained composure, before marvellously disguising his opinion in a deliberately transparent manner.

'It is a top question, top question... but because I am always honest in my answers, I cannot answer you,' Mourinho replied, cunningly.
