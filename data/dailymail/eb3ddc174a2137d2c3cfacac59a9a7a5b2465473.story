A cancer sufferer travelled thousands of miles across China to buy a two-legged goat that walks on its hind legs because he admires its strong spirit.

Wang Xinmin, who suffers from lymphoma, journeyed from his hometown in Fuyang in eastern China's Anhui Province to buy the animal for 4,500 Yuan (£450) in Zhoukou in Henan Province.

The 31-year-old made the decision after reading a newspaper report about how the goat had taught itself to walk after being born with only two hind legs.

Wang said: 'When I saw the report about the goat, I felt I had the responsibility to protect it as it is so earnest for life.

'I want to bring it up as its strong spirit is the best drug to me'.

The goat was apparently born in a litter of four in August.

Farmer Zhao Jinfeng said: 'The mother goat produced litters before and they were all healthy and normal, but this one among four only has two hind legs.'

Quirk of nature: The goat was apparently born in a litter of four in August

According to Zhao, a month after its birth the two-legged goat started to teach itself how to walk on its hind legs.

A vet said the abnormality was due to genetic mutation.

Wang is the eldest of five children. In 2002, he was admitted by Anhui University, but two years later was forced to quit because his family was in so much poverty.

After working for two years, he returned the university and graduated in 2008. He now runs a start-up company with a friend.

Three years ago, a pig born with just its two front legs became an unlikely celebrity in Henan Province, China.

The
 animal, known by villagers as Zhu Jianqiang, which means Strong-Willed 
Pig, learned to walk after its owner began training it by lifting it up 
by its tail.
