Qatar have pulled out of the women's basketball competition at the Asian Games after refusing to abide by international regulations preventing them from wearing hijabs.

The Qatari players had been asked to remove their head coverings before their opening group game against Mongolia on Wednesday, but chose to pull out of the match instead.

According to International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, Article 4.2.2 says players cannot wear 'headgear, hair accessories and jewellery'.

With no sign of the rule being relaxed ahead of their next scheduled match against Nepal on Thursday, Qatar decided to withdraw from their remaining games.

An assistant with Qatar's National Olympic Committee said: 'We have decided not to take part in the remainder of the Asian Games women's basketball competition.'

Nepal's players took the court for 15 minutes in their opening match on Wednesday, before the forfeit was announced.

Both Qatar games were recorded as 20-0 defeats on the Asian Games' official website.

The opening ceremony of the 17th Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, took place on Friday night - but the International Basketball Federation's rules on headgear has angered Qatari competitors 

The wearing of hijabs has become a hot topic in sport in recent years with Muslim athletes complaining they are being discriminated against.

Judoka Wojdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shaherkani, a judo competitor, made the headlines at the 2012 London Olympics when Saudi Arabia demanded she be allowed to compete wearing a hijab.

While international judo federation rules at the time barred her from doing so, Shaherkani was eventually allowed to compete wearing a modified veil.

Human Rights Watch said it should have been up to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to prove why Qatari players should not wear headscarves.

'We oppose any general ban on wearing of headscarves and onus should be on the regulator to prove why a ban is necessary on the basis of health and safety,' it said.

'In the case of basketball, it's difficult to see how a ban on the headscarf is anything other than an unnecessary restriction on the players' rights to religious freedom and personal autonomy.'

Competition at the Asian Games is conducted under the regulations of the sports' international governing bodies, meaning athletes in other sports are free to wear hijabs. Basketball remains the exception. 

All four bronze medal-winning rowers of Iran's lightweight women's quadruple sculls team wore hijabs on Wednesday, while Kuwait's Najlaa I M Aljerewi and Iran's Aghaei Hajiagha Soraya wore them in the triathlon and badminton events on Thursday. 

FIBA said earlier this month it held discussions on the issue and was introducing a two-year 'testing phase' on what players can wear, though that only applies at the national level, not international competitions such as the Asian Games. 

The situation has left Qatari athletes confused and angry.

Qatari player Ahlam Salem M. Al-Mana said: 'We have to take this stand. We knew about the hijab ban but we have to be here. We have to show everyone that we are ready to play, but the International Association is not ready.'

The Asian Games, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, has brought 9,500 athletes from 45 countries to Incheon in South Korea to compete in the world's second biggest multi-sports event after the Summer Olympics.
