We're in the Cotswolds, of course, as the name, The Grazing Goat, suggests with all the subtlety of a Boris leadership bid.

Except that we're not. Rather, this is Little Quebec Street, near Marble Arch in London, where an old boozer has been given the full country chic make-over, with eight bedrooms above the rustic dining room.

Country living: The Grazing Goat has been given the full chic make-over and rooms cost from £205

If this really were the Cotswolds, a double would cost £120 tops, but here on the Portland estate I'm paying £205 room only.

I had tried to get the rate down, but was told in a deadpan sort of way that it was out of the question.

There's no bath, but the bed is huge and there are two proper sash windows facing the front and, hallelujah, they open wide. Muted colours, some exposed beams, wood floors, Roberts digital radio.

On the ground floor, the wood-panelled restaurant spills out onto the pavement and there's a long, slinky bar.

Three little framed county walks hang above a door and rural intent is never far away.

More of the same, but a little more formal, is going on upstairs, with antlers on the wall and sepia photographs of men shooting, fishing and stalking.

A round table of Sloaney girls notches up the decibel levels. They'll be in the real Cotswolds by Friday evening, eating in somewhere identical with a similar menu, too.

I start with half a dozen oysters from Northern Ireland and move on to some delicious line-caught cod with undercooked roast potatoes.

It's the overly loud music which drives me back upstairs to bed, but I can still hear it as I drift off.

Overall comfort would be helped if the duvet and pillows had proper feathers in them. 

The music is still going strong at breakfast. It must be more for the benefit of the trendy staff than the guests.

Breakfast is all a la carte and works out to be expensive. My granola with yoghurt arrives long after I've downed two cups of coffee.

A final word about the name: it derives from Lady Portland's allergy to cow's milk and this is where she used to graze her goats.

So it's the real deal, after all, but a pricey real deal all the same.
