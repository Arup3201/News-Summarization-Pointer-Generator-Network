A former QPR scout revealed that the club paid him £50 for alerting them to England and Liverpool star Raheem Sterling.

Peter Moring spotted the forward as a nine-year-old playing in Wembley, and told the Brent and Kilburn Times he knew straight away that Sterling was special prospect.

'I was running the football at the London Underground sports ground where the Ark Academy now is, and I allowed the Brent primary and secondary schools to play there,' said Moring.

'One day I was down there and I saw this little kid playing for Oakington Manor school.

'The guy he was with was a bloke called Darren, who was one of the coaches from the church team Alpha & Omega.

'I said to Darren, "this kid is good, can I get him down to QPR?".

'What we agreed was for Raheem to keep playing for the Alpha & Omega side and I would inform John O’Brien, who was in charge of the QPR Under-16s, and arrange for him to come up and watch him.

Liverpool signed Sterling from QPR for an initial fee of £500,000 in 2010, which could potentially rise to around £5million with add-ons.

Moring added: 'At 10 years of age he was down at QPR but he wasn’t allowed to sign on. When he was Under-11 they signed him and I got £50 from the club for him.

'I was scouting for them at that time. I fell out with John, even though I knew him personally.

'When he was 12, John Creith got involved with Rangers as youth development officer, but he never took him down there – I did. I got paid for it.

'But John was there on the day I spotted him playing for his school.'
