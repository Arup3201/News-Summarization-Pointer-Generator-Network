Police are questioning four people on suspicion of murder after a man was found sprawled in an alleyway with fatal injuries.

The 45-year-old victim was spotted unconscious in the early hours of Sunday in Crawley, West Sussex. Police said he could have lain undiscovered for up to five hours.

The Portuguese national was taken to hospital but died of his injuries yesterday afternoon.

A woman aged 22 and three men aged 23, 33 and 48, all from Crawley, were arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday and are being questioned.

Sussex Police said the man had been assaulted but gave no further detail of the injuries.

The alleyway next to an industrial estate in the Three Bridges district was sealed off while forensic teams hunted for evidence, and officers have appealed for witnesses.

Detective Inspector Wendy Burton said: 'Although four people are now in custody we would still like to speak to anyone who was in the area between 10.30pm on Saturday and 3.25am [on Sunday].

'We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in the area around Stephenson Way or Haslett Avenue East near Three Bridges football club between those times.

'We would also like to hear from anyone who may have been told something about what happened in the alleyway.

'If you know something, or you know someone who does, please contact us. We urgently need to piece together exactly what has happened.'

The man, who has not been named, was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton after initially being treated by paramedics.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Taylor added: '[You] may have seen or heard something that is important to our investigation but not realise it. Please contact us if you know anything at all about what happened.'
