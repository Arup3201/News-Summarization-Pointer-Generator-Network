HSBC is set to strip its executives of part of their bonuses for the role they played in a mis-selling scandal that affected thousands of elderly savers.

Britain’s biggest bank is expected to confirm that it will become the latest to claw back shares and cash from a number of senior employees, as it posts annual profits up around 15 per cent to £13.8billion.

The news was expected to be revealed as the bank also confirmed a pay package worth up to £12.5 million for its chief executive Stuart Gulliver.

Outrage: Executives at the bank are set to lose their bonuses over their part in mis-selling scandal that affected thousands of elderly savers

The banking giant, which makes an estimated 90% of its money outside Britain and has benefited from its exposure to emerging markets in Asia, said UK pre-tax profits rose 17.2 per cent to £1.5 billion.

It comes after Lloyds Banking Group last week ‘adjusted’ payouts to 13 directors, reducing them by £2million to reflect the scandal of mis-sold insurance.

At HSBC, employees within its Nursing Home Fees Agency had persuaded pensioners as old as 94 to gamble their life savings on risky investments they might not have lived to see pay out.

London’s leading shares index fell into the red today with HSBC among the biggest losers despite its huge yearly profits haul.

The bank's shares dropped 2 per cent, or 14.1p to 560.9p, after it said profits rose 15 per cent to 21.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2011.

Despite posting profits which were the among the biggest ever reproted by a British company HSBC's fourth quarter results disappointed the City.

With Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays also on the fallers’ board, the FTSE 100 Index declined nearly 1 per cent, or 51.6 points to 5883.3.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US was also in negative territory amid fears that high oil prices - currently trading at about 108 US dollars per barrel after falling from earlier highs - would put a brake on the fragile economic recovery.

Thousands of frail care home residents saw their life savings devastated by rogue financial advisers.

Sources close to the bank say it is unlikely to reveal details of how many employees will be affected, or how much they will have to return.

The board wanted to claw back a chunk of rewards already given to staff to demonstrate their horror at the mis-selling.

Last December HSBC was fined a record £10.5million and ordered to repay £29.3million after NHFA was found to have mis-sold investments to 2,485 pensioners between 2005 and 2010.

Victims were convinced to part with an average sum of £115,000, often nest eggs from the sales of their homes.

Lloyds’s decision last week effectively to fine some of its directors has set a precedent that other banks will find difficult to ignore.

HSBC knew it would be in the spotlight
as it becomes the first to link the names of its top bankers with 
individual bonus awards. It will publish the list today alongside its 
2011 results, but its rivals will wait until next month.

Those
in line for bumper payouts include chief executive Stuart Gulliver, who
could receive as much as £11.25million on top of his £1.25million 
salary and £612,500 pension contribution.

Mr Gulliver said 2011 was 'a year of major progress for HSBC'.

He said: 'We recorded a strong performance in faster-growing markets and had a record year in commercial banking.

'I am pleased with our progress but there is a lot more to do and we remain focused on delivering our targets.'

In the UK, HSBC met its Project Merlin targets agreed with the Government on lending to businesses in 2011, as loans to commercial customers hit a record high.

It loaned £49.4 billion to businesses, exceeding its target of £38.8 billion, with £11.9 billion going to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which was slightly higher than its target for a 15% increase on the previous year.

Package: HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver is in line for a bonus package of £12.5m

It aims to approve 80 per cent of applications from SMEs in 2012 and is to launch a £4 billion fund to help SMEs in the UK to trade with other businesses overseas in coming weeks.

The group also increased mortgage lending in the UK by 12 per cent to £13.2 billion, giving a 9.6 per cent share of the market, up from 2.5 per cet in 2007, and expects to loan £15 billion to homeowners in 2012, with £3 billion specifically for first-time buyers.

There is less controversy around HSBC’s bonuses as it did not go cap in hand to the taxpayer for money and is hugely profitable, but it will still be expected to cut pay under intense political and public pressure. A spokesman declined to comment.
