One North Carolina man woke up to conditions so blistering cold that the bottles of water he kept in the back of his pick-up truck turned to ice in a matter of seconds. 

The unidentified man demonstrated the quick freeze in a video post shared on Digg.

The man introduces the video saying that he's shooting this footage on January 8th in Raleigh, North Carolina.

According to Time and Date, temperatures there that morning ranged around 11 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The Smithsonian notes that while there are mitigating factors, water will most often freeze at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

'Went to my truck this morning, I keep some water out here in the truck bed, and most of it I noticed is frozen solid so can't really drunk it,' he says. 'I saw a couple in the bed of the truck still liquid. i went to pick it up and it turned into this frozen bottle in a few seconds.'

The man then presents a fresh bottle from the truck bed which ices over in a matter of seconds.
