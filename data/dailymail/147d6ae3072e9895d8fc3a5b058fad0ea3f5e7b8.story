The 63-year-old woman shot dead in her car by a suspected serial killer was a shaman on a spiritual quest, friends have revealed.

Grandmother Carol Raynsford and her partner 
James Johnson, 63, were found in Sedona, Arizona - a desert town famed for its New Age 
culture.

Police officers believe the couple was gunned down at close range in an unprovoked and random attack as they vacationed in the area.

Murder: Police have few clues in the killing of the New Hampshire couple found shot in their car on Friday

They are now investigating whether the couple was murdered by the same man who shot a deputy sheriff dead two days later.

William Coleman, 50, was killed on Sunday as he responded to a 
burglary. A man got out of a van and opened fire, striking Coleman under his bulletproof vest.

It has now emerged that the woman who 
met such a violent end lived a life devoted to folk music, travel and 
spiritual healing practices.

Raynsford studied acupuncture and Eastern 
medicine and operated a 
business under the name the Village Shaman, the New Hampshire Union Leader reports.

She studied music before moving to Nelson, New Hampshire with her late husband, Keith 
Duesenberry, in the 
1970s to join the Monadnock Valley folk scene.

Throughout the 1980s, she sang alto with a folk band called Heartsong, and more recently produced solo CDs, including an album called Oh Hear The Flowers Sing.

'She proclaimed herself a shaman on a
 spiritual quest,' close friend Annie Ames added. 'She 
would do what she wanted to do, going away to travel 
and hike when she wanted to.'

Ames insisted Raynsford would not have seen her death as tragic.

'Her voice and spirit will carry on,'
 Ames said. 'We all thought she had a guardian angel, but on that day I 
guess the guardian angels were busy.'

The victims were found in a late-model 
red Subaru wagon, the same car Raynsford drove, Ames told the Union Leader.

Johnson worked for the New Hampshire 
Division of Parks and Recreation at Monadnock State Park, the paper 
reported. The pair had become 'involved' in recent years, Ames said.

Authorities are now searching for a 
white Dodge or Chevy truck with a white camper shell seen in the area 
before the bodies were found.

Police
 are investigating whether the killings linked to the shooting of deputy
 sheriff William Coleman, 50, two days later, when he responded to a 
burglary.

Location: Interstate 17 connects the two locations where the couple and the sheriff deputy were shot

Vacation spot: The couple was found in Sedona, Arizona - known for its sandstone rocks and New Age culture

A man got out of a van and opened fire, striking Coleman under his bulletproof vest.

The suspect was shot and killed by other
 deputies. The Arizona Republic reported that Coleman and the couple 
were all shot with a high-powered rifle. Both crime scenes are connected
 by Interstate 17.

The theory that the two shootings may be
 the work of the same gunman could explain why the man decided to open 
fire on the deputies, Deputy Jeffrey Sprong said.

'That [a connection] is definitely 
something our investigators will look into,' Sprong said. 'It wouldn't 
surprise me if it turned out to be the same guy.'

Arizona police said the couple were shot
 with a .223-calibre rifle at close range.

Cartridge shells from the 
weapon were found by authorities on both sides of the vehicle, 
suggesting one of the victims was forced to wait in horror as their 
companion was killed.

Members of a Jeep club found them in their red older-model Subaru sedan at a remote turnout on Arizona 89A on Friday morning.

It is not known how long they had been dead. Detectives are using receipts and other items found inside the vehicle to try to trace their steps and establish a timeline.

Unprovoked: James Johnson and Carol Raynsford, both aged 63, were shot at close range while on vacation

She an adult daughter,Ginger, and a son, James, and recently welcomed a granddaughter, friends told the Union Leader.

'She was beautiful and spiritual. She was probably the purest, nicest woman Iâ€™ve met,' neighbour Geoffrey Howard said.

'It doesn't appear it was provoked in any way, that's what makes it so unusual and baffling for our detectives,' he said.

Deputies are looking for an older white Chevrolet or Dodge pickup with an older camper shell and red ribbons hanging from the rear-view mirror seen in the area. They have posted a $1,000 reward.

'We're just hoping someone who drove by on this busy highway sometime this morning may have seen a car pull out fast or something suspicious,' says D'Evelyn.

Some callers reported seeing the car parked at the turnout on Thursday, and detectives are using receipts and other items found inside the vehicle to try to trace their steps and establish a timeline.
