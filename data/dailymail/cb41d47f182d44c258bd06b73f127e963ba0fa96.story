When John Terry changed in to his kit to celebrate Chelsea's 2012 Champions League final victory he drew considerable criticism, but Kevin Grosskreutz has gone one step further.

Dortmund's utility man got a tattoo of the World Cup on his back despite not playing a single minute during the competition.

Germany ended their 24-year wait for World Cup glory earlier this month when they beat Argentina 1-0 in the final at the Maracana.

Mario Gotze's brilliant extra-time goal was enough to seal a magnificent World Cup for Joachim Lowe's side, who battered hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.

And the 26-year-old Grosskreutz clearly felt no shame in laying claim to his team's achievement. he was one of the 23-man squad in Brazil but he failed to make a single appearance.

Chelsea's 
captain was mocked for his antics in 2012 but he had at least played a 
crucial role for the London club in getting them to that stage, Grosskreutz would struggle to make the same claim.

Grosskreutz has had a mixed year, with World Cup glory (sort of) on the pitch but controversy off it. He was accused of assault in May by Cologne fans after they reported him for throwing a kebab at them, and later that month had to apologise for urinating in a hotel lobby.
