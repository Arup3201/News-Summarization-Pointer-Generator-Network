This is the dramatic moment a couple and their two young children were rescued from the roof of their car today after getting trapped in a swollen river.

Police were called to the scene at 2.20pm to reports their 4x4 had been taken off course as they tried to cross a ford after heavy rain.

The terrified family, including a baby, were forced to clamber onto the roof as water threatened to enter the vehicle.

They were rescued by firefighters who used a lifeboat to bring them to safety. Two dogs were also saved.

Northumbria Police said they were left shaken, but unhurt by their ordeal at Bennett's Walk, Morpeth, Northumberland.

A police spokesperson said: 'It appears the vehicle was taken by swollen water while crossing the ford - drivers are urged to use caution when crossing any water while heavy rain persists.'

The vehicle was crossing Wansbeck River in Morpeth when it was swept off course and the rescue took around 50 minutes.

It came as forecasters warned that heavy rain which prompted severe weather alerts for parts of southern England and Wales was moving north, bringing new flood risks.

The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for large parts of the country from south Wales to East Anglia.

Now
forecasters say as much as 40mm of rain could fall in northern England 
and central and southern Scotland in the next 24 hours.

MeteoGroup
forecaster Brendan Jones said: 'It has been pretty wet across the UK 
but much of the heavy rain in the south is moving its way north.

'The
focus of the heavy rain will be across northern England and central and
southern Scotland, with another 20 to 40mm of rain expected to fall in 
those areas over the next 24 hours.

'Parts of the Midlands and Yorkshire may also see some lively thunderstorms.'

Mr Jones said there was the possibility of snow falling in northern parts of Scotland.

He added: 'It’s certainly going to feel chilly particularly in Scotland. There is a possibility in the Scottish mountains the heavy rain could fall as snow.'

But
sun is around the corner with a dry few days forecast this weekend, 
making it the first fine one since March, according to forecasters.

Temperatures, in many areas are predicted to reach 15C (59F) today and Friday and 
rising to highs of 18C (65F) on Saturday, which will be mostly dry and 
bright, but the respite is only temporary, with storms returning next week.

By lunchtime today, parts of the 
South, the Midlands and Wales are predicted to have up to 30mm of 
rainfall - almost half the monthly average of 66mm in just 24 hours.

Severe weather warnings are in place for parts of southern England and Wales, but the extreme conditions are expected to
head north tonight with Cumbria and southern Scotland in line for a 
prolonged and heavy soaking.

The Environment Agency has issued one flood warning for the southwest of England and 29 flood alerts cross Britain

The Environment Agency predicted 
flooding on the Tone in Somerset and on half a dozen more rivers across 
the South. The downpours will be accompanied by winds of up to 50mph.

Environment
Agency flood manager Katharine Evans said: 'Following an exceptionally 
wet April which led to some flooding last week, rivers are high and the 
ground is saturated, meaning that further rainfall brings with it an 
increased risk of flooding.

'We
are continuing to closely monitor the forecast and rainfall, 
particularly for rivers in South Wales, Devon and Cornwall. And 
Environment Agency teams are out on the ground keeping a close watch on 
river levels, as well as checking defences and clearing any potential 
blockages to reduce the risk of flooding.

'If
flooding does happen, we would urge people to keep away from swollen 
rivers and not to attempt to walk or drive through floodwater.'

Met Office three day weather forecast

A massive rescue operation has been taking place to save more than 1,000 mating fish left high and dry because of the floods.

As the River Severn rose following last week's torrential rain, the water lapped over the banks and submerged nearby fields.

Fish, including bream and carp weighing up to 15lbs, suddenly found they
were able to swim out of the river at Upton-upon-Severn and into the 
fields to find a spot to mate.

But they were left gasping and stranded when the rains eased and the floods started to subside.

Environment Agency fisheries officers and volunteers have been working 
to catch and move the fish back to the river in buckets on the back of a
Land Rover.

Dave Throup, environment manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, 
said 'They were all big fish, some probably 30 years old - there were no
tiddlers.

'We are keeping an eye on them but we may have to rescue any more that get stuck and clear any debris from their path.'

May has been dismal so far after the 
wettest April since records began. Rivers burst their banks last month 
after running dry in drought conditions.

More than five inches of rain fell 
last month – around double the long-term average. There was flooding in 
Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire and localised flooding on roads across the
South.

Met Office forecaster Dan 
Williams said: ‘We are expecting heavy rain overnight into the early 
hours of Thursday across the south of England, particularly the South 
West, due to low pressure.

‘The same system will make its way north during the afternoon which will see heavy downpours from Thursday evening.

‘There will still be some light rain 
and drizzle at the start of Friday in the northern areas but that will 
start to clear and it will be a dry day with sunny spells although 
fairly gusty.

‘It’s a similar story on Saturday with
some light showers in northern parts but dry and bright in the South.’

Forecaster Brendan Jones of Meteogroup said: ‘Most of the country will 
see substantial rain over the next few days. Unfortunately there is no 
end in sign for the unsettled weather.’

Motorists have been advised to take extra care because of a risk of localised flooding and extremely wet roads.

Today’s downpours follow a period of unsettled weather that has seen unusual storms hit parts of the country.

Rain ahead: Severe weather warnings are in place for parts of southern England and Wales, but the extreme conditions are expected to head north tonight with Cumbria and southern Scotland in line for a heavy rain

A ‘supercell’ storm travelled through 
the South Midlands earlier this week, bringing rain, large hailstones 
and a tornado to Oxfordshire.

Retailers say the poor weather has 
resulted in their biggest sales falls for more than a year, with 
clothing markets especially badly hit.

Despite the rain, hosepipe bans remain in place for 20million householders and are due to last until the end of the year.

Water firms say the drought is the 
worst they have had to face since the summer of 1976. However, the Mail 
revealed yesterday that they will not accept tougher targets on reducing
leaks unless they can charge customers more.

Industry regulator Ofwat is asking the water companies to reduce leakages by just 1.5 per cent by 2015.
