The homeless woman who was mocked in a Vogue editor's 'cruel' Instagram post that caused a storm around the world today hit back at the fashionista German princess, saying her situation is 'no joke'.

Huddling inside her thick winter coat with a blanket over her lap, Maryse Dumas, said: 'It's not nice taking pictures of people living on the street, that not polite', adding: 'It's no joke being destitute, living on the street. 

'Look at me surrounded by all this rubbish, it's ugly. It's hard living on the street. It's cold at night and if you can't sleep you get ill. My legs hurt and I'm losing my teeth.'

Hurt: Maryse Dumas told MailOnline that the post by the Vogue editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn Und Taxis was 'not nice, that not polite'

'Out of touch': The German princess posted this photo on Instagram, with the caption, 'Paris is full of surprises....and @vouguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' It caused outrage

Vogue editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted a picture of Miss Dumas reading a copy of the fashion magazine on Instagram on Saturday.

The princess accompanied the photograph with the caption; 'Paris is full of surprises and @voguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!'

She was almost immediately hit with a barrage of criticism, with Instagram users describing the photo as 'cruel' and 'tasteless'.

Surrounded by plastic bags, cardboard boxes and suitcases, the 65-year-old spends her days looking at colourful pictures and drawing, as the rich and famous walk past her on the street in central Paris that is her home.

Confused but good-natured, Miss Dumas said she had picked up the fashion magazine as she liked the colours.

She told MailOnline: 'I like colours. I liked that Vogue magazine because of the colours. But I don't have it any more. Once I've read something I throw it away. I like colouring as well.'

She added: 'I don't remember a young woman taking my picture – let alone a princess.'

A long-standing member of Paris' homeless community Miss Dumas has lived on the streets for as long as anyone can remember.

Under fire: Many  criticized von Thurn und Taxis for posting the picture. Some claimed the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless'. The fashionista was back on the front row on Monday at the Giambattista Valli show (right)

Hard life: Miss Dumas said that she has lived on the street for as long as she can remember. She said she has trouble sleeping in the cold, has bad legs and is losing her teeth.

Help: A spokeswoman for the homeless charity, Emmaus, told MailOnline: 'Maryse has been living on the streets for a long time. She is bit confused but she is friendly. We do our best for her and we know her well'

Hand-outs: She relies on the goodwill of those passing by - and even the homeless give her their belongings

A spokeswoman for the homeless charity, Emmaus, told MailOnline: 'Maryse has been living on the streets for a long time. She is bit confused but she is friendly. We do our best for her and we know her well.'

Miss Dumas says she does not know how long she has been on the street.

She told MailOnline: 'I have been here for a while, I don't know how long. I found this place one night and I have been ever since'.

The old lady has become such a permanent fixture on the road where she beds down that other homeless people leave their belongings with her.

Miss Dumas told MailOnline: 'I'm always here. Other people on the street leave their stuff with me to look after. I live in Paris now but I don't know where I grew up.

'I know I'm not married and that I don't have any children but I don't know if my parents are still alive. I'm all alone.'

Miss Dumas says she makes ends meet the hand outs she receives from passers-by.

She told MailOnline: 'I survive from the donations that I get from people walking by. They are not my friends, just people who walk past and take pity on me. I get help from charities as well, like Emmaus, they look out for me.'

Miss Dumas' pitiful existence, is a far cry from the luxurious lifestyle of 32-year-old Princess Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis.

Known as TNT – the initials from her surname Thurn und Taxis – is based in London and has been writing as a style editor-at-large for Vogue since 2012.

Throwaway fashion: Miss Dumas said: 'I like colours. I liked that Vogue magazine because of the colours. But I don't have it any more. Once I've read something I throw it away'

Waiting for an apology: The 65-year-old told MailOnline: 'No one has said sorry to me'

Arriving in the French capital on Friday night the princess has enjoyed the splendour of Paris fashion week, while Maryse Dumas has bedded down for the night on the cold pavement outside.

Alighting from the first class carriage of the Eurostar train from London von Thurn und Taxis was picked up by a waiting motorbike taxi – to beat the rush hour traffic – to make it to the Dior fashion show.

The princess has been styled by top professionals, including celebrity hairdresser David Mallett, who she has thanked for 'turning my Eurostar mess into a look'.

She has rubbed shoulders with the great and good at exhibitions given by style houses including fashion designer Simone Rocha, vintage boutique Resee and jeweller Noor Fares.

The princess' evening ended with a gala dinner hosted by luxury shoe handbag and accessory designer Charlotte Olympia, who presented each guest with a piece of miniature footwear.

Von Thurn und Taxis finally deleted the post mocking Miss Dumas on Sunday – after she was attacked for her bad taste.

Style website Fashionista claimed the photo, like von Thurn und Taxis' other content, was 'out of touch'.

It wrote: 'The things she writes, both in Vogue and on social media, often straddle the line between entertaining / aspirational and disturbingly out of touch.

'On Saturday she crossed the line.'

Initially the princess questioned the criticism, writing; 'Why cruel? The person to me is as dignified as anyone!'

But on Sunday she wrote; 'I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the offense [sic] my post has caused. Yours truly Elisabeth.'

However by lunchtime on Monday, Miss Dumas has not received an apology from the princess, who was back at Paris Fashion Week at the Giambattista Valli show.

Glamour: Von Thurn und Taxis was in Paris for Fashion week when she posted the photo. On the left she can be seen at the Christian Dior show with Noor Fares and Olympia Scarry. On the right she is pictured at the Christian Dior - Party At les Bains Douches on Thursday.

The 65-year-old homeless lady told MailOnline: 'No one has said sorry to me.'

Born at the family's ancestral home, the Thurn und Taxis Castle, a 8th century, 500-room abbey in Regensburg, Germany, in March 1982, Elisabeth is the second child of Johannes, 11th Princes of Thurn und Taxis and his Countess wife, Gloria von Schoenburg-Glauchau.

Her brother, Albert, 31, who succeeded their father in 1990 as Albert II, Prince of Thurn und Taxis, has a net worth of more than £1 billion and races in a German auto-racing league.

The princess was educated at Sevenoaks in Kent and has a bachelor's degree from the American University in Paris.

The von Thurn und Taxis family wealth originated from their postal system empire which can be traced back to around 1290 when two early ancestors operated courier services in the Italian city-states.

But the family's important postal activities began with Franz von Taxis, who served as postmaster to the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I from 1489 and to Philip I of Spain from 1504.

The Prussian empire originally bought out the Thurn and Taxis monopoly in 1867 and used it as the basis for a new German national post.

A member of the family is believed to have invented the taximeter, which is why taxicabs came to bear his name.

The House of Thurn and Taxis held the rank of royalty in the German Empire until 1918.
