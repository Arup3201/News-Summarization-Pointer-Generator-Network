Kwasi Enin has a very tough decision to make.

On March 27, as tens of thousands of the country's university hopefuls similarly waited patiently at their computers for news - if any - that their applications were successful, the 17-year-old from Long Island, who had already been accepted early into Princeton, got into Brown.

And then Columbia. And then Cornell, Yale and Dartmouth, too.

'I was like - this can't be happening!' Kwasi told Newsday.

Now that's high achievement: Kwasi Enin, 17 a senior at William Floyd High School in Shirley, New York, applied to all eight Ivy League Universities - and was accepted by the lot

Harvard University - a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts - has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent, meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in. They accepted Kwasi Enin

By 5pm, he had six Ivy League colleges offering him a place at their institutions, and then the toughest of them all, Harvard, sent the William Floyd High School student an email.

The university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted Kwasi.

Cornell, similiarly, accepted only 14 per cent.

So what makes Kwasi so desirable as a freshman?

With an SAT score of 2,250 out of 2,400 - which places him in the 99th percentile for all students taking the exam - as a competitive shot putter he is also a star athlete.

He also sings and plays viola for the school orchestra.

Kwasi is a first generation American from Ghana.

His parents, both nurses, moved to New York in the 1980s.

His father, Ebenezer Enin, said Kwasi - who wants to study medicine - was raised to strive for excellence.

'He's an amazing kid. He's very humble.,' Mr Enin said.

'He's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid.

'We have been encouraging him to be an all-around student. So far, he has proved himself.'

Kwasi Enin matriculated at William Floyd High School, a large school on Long Island, New York. His principal said that, from the start, it was clear he would succeed

According to USA Today, Kwasi's feat is extremely rare, with few students even able to apply to all eight Ivy Leagues, because each seeks different qualities in their students.

'My heart skipped a beat when he told me he was applying to all eight' says Nancy Winkler, the guidance counselor at William Floyd.

In 29 years as a counselor, she says, she's never seen anything like this.

'It's a big deal when we have students apply to one or two Ivies. To get into one or two is huge. It was extraordinary.'

Kwasi's success is the third big college announcement highlighting Black male excellence in recent weeks.

Another success story: Avery Coffey, 17, a senior at D.C.'s prestigious Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, applied to five Ivy League schools and was accepted to all of them.

Coffey, who has a 4.3 GPA in his intense International Baccalaureate program, applied and was accepted to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Brown.

All but Harvard have already presented Coffey with generous financial aid packages.

Chad Thomas, a senior football player at Miami's Booker T. Washington High School, has received 150 scholarship offers for his talent both on and off the gridiron.
