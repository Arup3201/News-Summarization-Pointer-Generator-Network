The ugly American fallout from the Ryder Cup has been reignited after Rickie Fowler - the US wonderkid - hit back at Phil Mickelson - the team's de facto leader - for his public criticism of Tom Watson's captaincy at Gleneagles.

Mickelson and Fowler had forged a close bond on tour, with the former Masters, Open and US PGA champion taking the younger Californian under his wing and the pair playing regular money games against each other. But that hasn't stopped Fowler, 25, taking aim at Mickelson over the embarrassing character assassination the 44-year-old dealt Watson in September.

Fowler, speaking in China at the WGC-HSBC Champions event won by Bubba Watson on Sunday, not only insisted that any grievances against Watson should not have been made in public, but also gave clear backing to Watson's captaincy, saying he did a 'great job' and calling the eight-time major winner a 'legend'.

'The unfortunate part, I believe, is that stuff that happens in the team room should stay there,' said Fowler.

'I thought Tom did a great job of talking to the guys. He had been there plenty of times, and I enjoyed the time I got to spend with him. I respect him, he is a legend within the game.

'Some things may have got blown a little bit out of proportion. But obviously we didn’t play as well as we needed to in order to win.'

Intriguingly, both Fowler and Mickelson are on the 11-man 'task force', which also includes Tiger Woods, appointed to end American misery in golf's biennial showpiece ahead of the next match at Hazeltine in 2016. The US have lost eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups against Europe, never got close to Paul McGinley's side in Scotland, then aired their dirty laundry in public thanks to Mickelson's comments in that now infamous press conference.

Fowler, who finished in the top five at every major championship this year, hinted that the 'task force' would have some lively discussions over the direction US golf needs to take to avoid future embarrassment.

And he admitted one thing Mickelson would surely echo: 'It sucks losing'.

'I am looking forward to getting together with the guys to see what everyone has to say,' saifd Fowler.

'Clearly, we want to win the Cup, and it is not as if there has been a lack of motivation or anything like that. It sucks losing. Everyone is aware of that and everyone wants to win.'
