A pet owner has been left devastated after her beloved dog was beaten to death by a neighbor's friend, she claimed.

Duke, a German Shepherd, was killed on Tuesday after he jumped a fence and ran towards the neighbor's pitbull, said owner Linda Lorenzen.

She says that she could have pulled the dog away but the man just kept hitting Duke with a bat at the home in White Lake, Michigan. Mrs Lorenzen said her dog was hit around 25 times even after he had been knocked out.

Mrs Lorenzen told Fox 2: 'I was crying and begging him ''Please stop!'' because I could have walked over and pulled him away.

'But he wouldn't stop beating him so I'm not going to go over there and pull my dog away because this man's beating - he has a baseball bat, a metal baseball bat.'

On the heartbreaking video, Mrs Lorenzen can be heard comforting the animal. Her son Craig McIlmurray posted this message: 'Please take caution with this video as it shows the last moments of my dogs life, his whole head was swollen and his body was broken.

'It also shows the White lake police officer enter my home and give no help whatsoever.'

According to Mrs Lorenzen and her family, the dogs had been aggressive towards each other before but the owners had managed to separate them.

The family said that police appeared annoyed when they called to report the attack on their dog.

The family has set up a Facebook page 'Justice For Duke' where they write: 'This is a page dedicated to not only our family dog but are best friend who was brutally beaten to death by our neighbor with a baseball bat.'

Mrs Lorenzen added: 'He was my beloved family gental [sic], loving, loyal, household member, unbelievably human like 8yr old GSD gentle angle [sic] in heaven<3'

White Lake police would not comment on the investigation but said that a man had told them that he was bitten by the dog.Â 

Oakland County Animal Control has been called out to disturbances involving the animals before.
