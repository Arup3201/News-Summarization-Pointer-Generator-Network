Lewis Hamilton has vowed to reel in Nico Rosberg for a second time in this season's Formula One world title battle after swallowing another bitter pill in Canada.

Dicing with Rosberg for the lead of the Canadian Grand Prix, Hamilton was forced to retire after 47 laps with rear-brake failure sparked by the loss of the ERS (energy recovery system).

Although the ERS in Rosberg's car also failed, the 28-year-old went on to see the chequered flag, claiming second after being passed by Red Bull's debut winner Daniel Ricciardo two laps from home.

It means Hamilton is now 22 points behind Rosberg, a crushing blow after previously clawing back a 25-point deficit from the opening race in Australia where he retired and Rosberg triumphed.

'I did the best I could out there and felt like I was having a strong race, but unfortunately it just wasn't our day,' said Hamilton.

'There was nothing I could do about our issues. We were managing the loss of power, but as soon as I finally made the jump on Nico in the second pit stop, my brakes failed.

'There are no emotions other than I couldn't believe my car stopped and the other didn't, but that's the way it goes.

'Two DNFs (did not finish) is not helpful, but there's a long, long way to go. I've caught up before, so I'll catch up again.

'To not finish is disappointing, but there are plenty more races ahead of us this season so let's hope for better fortune.'

Previously, Hamilton had to reel off four successive victories to finally edge ahead of Rosberg in the standings.

Given the performance of the Mercedes car, despite the gremlins on show at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Hamilton feels it may take something similarly special.

'Naturally, for the team, I don't want either car not to finish so hopefully we don't have any issues on either car for the rest of the year,' added Hamilton.

'That obviously means I'll have even more work to do to make up the lost ground, probably another four wins, and I'll do what I can to get those.

'We've good tracks coming up, and the one for me is I make sure I win at Silverstone (British Grand Prix on July 6).'
