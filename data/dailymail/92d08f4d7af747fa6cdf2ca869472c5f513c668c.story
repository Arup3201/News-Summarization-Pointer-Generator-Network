Arrested: David DiPaolo, 31, has been charged with manslaughter over the death of Geoffrey Farrar

A Virginia man admitted to police that he killed his rock-climbing mentor with a claw hammer.

David DiPaolo, 31, has been charged with manslaughter after the body of Geoffrey Farrar, 69, was found at the base of a 35-foot tall rock face in Carderock Park in Maryland on December 28.

At first it was thought that Mr Farrar, from North Arlington, had died after a fall, but a medical examiner said that he had suffered massive head trauma, which pointed to foul play.

In addition, U.S Park Police heard from a witness that DiPaolo and Farrar had a heated argument before they set off climbing together, Fox News reported.

DiPaolo, from Bristow, fled the scene and was arrested in upstate New York last week.

According to a police report he did not object to being charged with manslaughter and said that following an argument, Farrar and tried to choke him.

As they wrestled on the ground, he reached for a claw hammer and struck Farrar on the head, the report said.

Farrar was an experienced climber and had been DiPaoloâ€™s mentor for 20 years, according to The Washington Post.

Both climbers were very well known in the climbing community around Carderock Park.

Climbing instructor William Kelley, 28, told The Washington Post: â€˜Every time you saw [Farrar] he was in a conversation with someone, giving them information about climbs. He was the guy at Carderock. He knew all the climbs, and he knew how they were supposed to be done.â€™
