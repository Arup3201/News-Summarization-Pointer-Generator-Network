The spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone this summer stemmed from one traditional healer’s funeral where 14 women were infected, experts have claimed.

Scientists have studied the blood of recent victims and believe the funeral, in mid-May might have acted as a ‘super-spreader’ event.

They say this is comparable to a case in 2003 in a hotel in Hong Kong where one doctor from China who had SARS infected nine other guests. These in turn spread the virus within the city and to other countries such as Canada and Vietnam.

The New York Times reports that the funeral took place in the diamond-mining community of Koindu.

This lies near Guéckédou in neighbouring Guinea where the outbreak is believed to have started in December.

The newspaper reports that the healer was known for treating a ‘mysterious illness’ which then turned out to be Ebola.

Although this had already been the suspected cause, the New York Times reports that it was confirmed by geneticists at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.

They are understood to have sequenced the virus found in 78 patients treated in the Kenema Government Hospital in northern Sierra Leone close to the borders with Guinea and Liberia.

The research was published in the journal Science.

The New York Times reports Dr W. Ian Lipkin from Columbia University as saying: ‘It’s frightening that a single event could catalyse a whole outbreak, but that’s what it looks like happened.

He added that the research was a ‘really nice piece of work’.

Experts also discovered that the West African strain of Ebola was different from the one that has been circulating in Central Africa, thousands of miles away, since the mid 1970s. But the newspaper reports that the two ‘probably diverged as far back as 2004’.

The study’s co-author Dr Pardi C. Sabeti, a geneticist at Harvard, said in that time it may have been circulating in forest animals including bats and apes.

But she added that ‘it could have been circulating in humans for 10 years with little or no notice.’

As of August 26, 422 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone while the outbreak has claimed the lives of 1,552 people across West Africa

Scientists say the research is helpful as tests to diagnose Ebola and vaccines being considered are based on the Central African strain. It means a current diagnostic test may not provide a clear positive if a patient had a ‘low viral load’ in the early stages of an infection, the newspaper reports.

The news comes a day after it was revealed that Ebola had spread to a fifth nation in West Africa.

A case of the deadly virus has been reported in Senegal, making it the first time a new country has been hit by the outbreak since July.

As of August 26, 1,552 people had been confirmed dead from Ebola in four countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.

Liberia was the worst affected with 694 deaths; 422 people have died in Sierra Leone; and 430 in Guinea, where the virus emerged at the start of the year. Nigeria has now recorded six deaths.
