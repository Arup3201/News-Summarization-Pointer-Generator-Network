A woman convicted of stabbing her partner to death sent a letter to her employer to say thank you for her Christmas present – the murder weapon.

Jeanette Javell, 42, murdered Ingemar Wallin, 49, in their home in Högbo, Sweden, using the fillet knife which she had been given as a Christmas present to stab and cut him over 30 times.

In a letter to her employer, sent from prison, the mother-of-five wrote: ‘Thank you for the Christmas gift by the way – it worked!’

Furious attack: Jeanette Javell, 42, shows police how she killed her partner Ingemar Wallin with the fillet knife during a reconstruction of the murder

Ms Javell attacked Mr Wallin, a father-of-two, in the early hours of Midsummer's Eve, a major Scandinavian holiday, in June this year.

Using the fillet knife her employer gave her for Christmas, she stabbed and cut him ’30-odd times’, of which at least three were fatal, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reports.

The couple had met earlier the same year and bought the house together shortly before Mr Wallin's murder on June 22.

After the violent attack, Ms Javell went to the bathroom to wash the blood off the knife, and then used her mobile phone to photograph her partner’s dead body.

The two pictures, taken at 02.50 and 
02.58 on the night of the murder, were later found on her phone. She 
said she took the photos so the police would believe her story.

After taking three of her children, who 
were staying with her and Mr Wallin to celebrate Midsummer's Eve, to 
relatives in Stockholm, she drove to a former colleague’s house where she
is alleged to have announced ‘I have killed him, I have killed him,’ 
upon her arrival.

Ms Javell claims to have acted in self-defence but police found no evidence of struggle in the house and the coroner's report stated that Mr Wallin may have been asleep or had just woken up at the time of the attack.

In a letter to Aftonbladet, Ms Javell claims she was ‘confused’ and that she ‘blacked out during a state of total delirium’.

She describes the furious attack as ‘an unfortunate event I wish could be undone’ and indicates that she does not see herself as a murderer.

Ms Javell is currently serving a 15-year prison sentence for murder, but her representatives are appealing the October conviction.
