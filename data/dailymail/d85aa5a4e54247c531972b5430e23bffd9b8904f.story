Dramatic footage has been released showing the first rescues since the Darington landslide that obliterated a community last month.

The landslide in Washington State has so far claimed 29 lives, but there was a ray of hope in the form of a woman who was among the first rescued, winched to safety with the only possession she has left...a painting of a wolf.

Robin Youngblood, from Oso, a woman of Native American faith, can be seen clutching the painting, which she claims represents the spirit animal that helped keep her alive during the fatal landslide.

The landslide claimed almost everything that Robin Youngblood owned, but thanks to search and rescue worker Randy Fay (pictured hanging from helicopter) she was able to keep hold of one possession - a painting of a wolf

Ms Youngblood was lifted on the first rescue helicopter hours after the landslide in Oso last month.

Like many others, her house was completely leveled, but she was luckily saved by rescue crew member Randy Fay.

The incredible footage shows Mr Fay saving Ms Youngblood, only to save the painting which coincidentally floated past them at the time of rescue.

According to Ms Youngblood, the painting bobbed on the surface of the muddy water and floated right next to her while she waited for rescue.

Randy Fay hands the painting to another worker: Robin Youngblood saw the painting bob over towards her in the water just before her rescue, and considered this a sign from her Creator that she was saved

She believes that the appearance of the painting was no coincidence.

Ms Youngblood said: 'It's a Cherokee night warrior, and the title of the painting is "Wolf Vision".

'For me it was sort of a sign that the Creator was protecting us and that we were going to make it out of there.

'Seeing it float up there, when everything else was matchsticks let me know that we were going to make it through this thing.'

Robin Youngblood believes that her spirit animal, the wolf, was the reason for her rescue, as it gave her strength throughout the ordeal

Ms Youngblood and her eventual saviour Mr Fay have since been able to meet for the first time since the rescue, in which Fay helped to preserve the painting.

Mr Fay said: 'If that's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life, I'm glad we were able to do that.'

Search and rescue events have been redoubled since the event ahead of forecasts of returning showers that could exacerbate rescue conditions.

Randy Fay and Robin Youngblood meet for the first time since the landslide destroyed her entire home except for her one possession

Mr Fay was happy to have saved the painting, even if it was only a small possession, saying: 'If that's the first dot in reconnecting and building her life, I'm glad we were able to do that'

Since the event, 13 people have been registered as missing and 29 have been declared officially dead.

The landslide struck on March 22, after a rain soaked hillside collapsed with no warning above the north side of the Stillaguamish River, which released a torrent of mud that washed over a state highway and three dozen houses on the outskirts of the town of Oso.

Officials are now worried that in the light of slightly warmer weather snow on the hilltops could melt, causing fresh water to stream into the Stillaguamish River, possibly adding to floods and making search and
 rescue efforts even harder.

The hillsides near the scene of the mudslide are now almost barren, because of the sheer power of the unexpected torrent that also levelled many parts of the community

Capt. Jeff Zonrnes, of the Monroe Fire Department: Search efforts have been redoubled to take advantage of the three-day dry spell, ahead of expected showers that could make the search and rescue conditions worse

Some sections of the slide area are already under 25 feet of water and are believed to contain more human remains.

There is also speculation that the area could be submerged by more than 100 feet of water within three to four weeks without a wider channel to divert the partially dammed river.

Mike Asher, an area fire chief acting as the head of operations for the east side of the disaster zone, said: 'There's a lot of snow left on the mountains surrounding the valley.'

'We're going to start facing runoff issues from that in the very near future.'

President Barack Obama has approved the state's request for a major disaster declaration for the slide, making federal relief assistance available to individuals, households and businesses impacted by the tragedy.

Twenty-six of those killed in the landslide have been identified, and authorities are still working to identify the three remaining confirmed fatalities.
