The PM knows that Nando’s — the fast food chain that’s spreading across the country like wildfire — crosses class, political and ethnic divisions

Forget the NHS, tax cuts or TV debates. The way to win British people’s hearts at the next election is through their stomachs.

When David Cameron told a hip youth radio station this week he’d like to take world leaders to lunch at Nando’s — rather than a Harvester or a Gordon Ramsay restaurant — he knew what he was talking about.

Not only has he visited a Bristol outlet of Nando’s — the fast food chicken chain that’s spreading across the country like wildfire — but he also knows that the restaurant crosses class, political and ethnic divisions.

Whoever gets the Nando’s vote at the election will sweep the nation. There are 333 Nando’s outlets in Britain; 1,000 in all, in 35 countries. Main markets are Britain, Australia and South Africa.

But Nando’s is big in America, too. When President Obama spoke at the University of Cape Town in 2013, he said of the South African chain: ‘In America, we see the reach of your culture — we’ve got a Nando’s a couple of blocks from the White House.’

What is the special ingredient that explains the chain’s extraordinary success? The literal answer is its peri-peri sauce. Peri-peri — Swahili for ‘pepper- pepper’ — originally comes from Mozambique, where the sauce was adopted by Portuguese colonials.

The ingredients are a secret combination of hot chilli pepper, lemon, garlic, herbs and spices.

The restaurant’s chickens — fresh, never frozen — are trimmed of fat, marinated overnight, and regularly basted with the peri-peri sauce while being flame-grilled.

It isn’t just the peri-peri sauce, though. When it opened in Britain in 1992, Nando’s hit the sweet spot of High Street dining through a combination of luck and hard-headed analysis of how to make money in the unpredictable restaurant trade.

First — price. Nando’s is a little more expensive than McDonald’s or KFC, but healthier, and far cheaper than any fancy restaurant. Four boneless, flame-grilled chicken thighs plus rice and salad — yours for £10.25.

On top of that, you get much more of a restaurant feel than the usual fast-food chains. A waiter shows you to your table; you order at the counter; the waiter brings you your food, with china plates and proper knives and forks.

Service is extremely quick — crucial in our I-want-it-now culture; handy, too, for harassed parents with demanding children. ‘Fast-casual dining’ is the buzzword of the modern restaurant business, and Nando’s has nailed the trend.

There is variety on the menu: you can choose how spicy you want your chicken, from plain to extra-hot. And there are other dishes: veggie burgers, steak rolls, mushroom and halloumi dishes and different salads.

But on the whole, the only big choices customers make are the size and type of the chicken portion — quarters, halves, wholes, butterfly breasts, thighs, legs, wings, chicken livers and chicken burgers — and what sauce they want.

The Prime Minister posed for a selfie with Nandos diner Becky Smith after visiting the restaurant in Bristol

The Prime Minister tucked into half a chicken, chips, coleslaw - washed down with a glass of red wine - in a Nandos in Bristol  last year. He said this week he'd like to take world leaders for a dinner at the chicken chain

The chicken isn’t quite fully free-range, but it is ‘Red Tractor’ standard, which means it is British and approved by independent inspectors. Some outlets are franchised; others directly owned by the company.

So it’s largely chicken, chicken and more chicken. And that leads to low overheads, a simple supply line and very little food thrown away.

It’s a formula that has conquered the nation: from the PM to Prince Harry, who’s been seen in the Nando’s in Fulham — London’s epicentre of the Sloane world.

The formula is also popular with young, black customers. The Muslim market, too, is catered for: halal chicken is available in 50 British outlets.

The Nando’s marketing campaign is shrewd. The Armed Forces, NHS workers, policemen and firemen get a 20 per cent discount. And the latest wheeze is the mythical Nando’s High Five Card, aka the Black Card, which entitles its exclusive owners, and four of their friends, to Nando’s meals for life.

Lewis Hamilton, Andy Murray and David Beckham are alleged to have a Black Card. Rapper Tinchy Stryder and Olympic boxer Nicola Adams confess to having one. Boxer David Haye and singer Ed Sheeran have apparently been photographed with one.

And Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party Chairman, says he yearns for one.

But in a brilliant bit of marketing, Nando’s refuses to admit the cards actually exist. So, hey presto, like Willy Wonka’s Golden Ticket in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, the Black Card enters the realm of dream, fantasy and magic.

Not everyone in Nando’s higher echelons has cottoned on to the beauty of the myth. In 2013, UK marketing director Keri Perkins said: ‘No gifts are given on the condition of anyone plugging us. It’s just thank yous.’

But the co-founder of Nando’s goes along with the mystery of the Black Card.

‘It’s a rumour, I believe,’ Robert Brozin, 55, from Johannesburg, said this week. ‘I haven’t got one. It’s about time they gave me one. If it does exist, I’d like one.’

Nando’s keeps snowballing and plans to increase the number of British restaurants every year by 30 outlets, with the same number across the rest of the world

Brozin cooked up the whole Nando’s idea in 1987 when a friend, Fernando Duarte, took him to Chickenland, a cafe in a Johannesburg suburb.

So knocked out was Brozin by the delicious chicken that he and Duarte borrowed £25,000 from family and friends to buy the cafe. They renamed it Nando’s, after Fernando.

Despite having no restaurant experience — Brozin had failed his accountancy exams and was selling electrical goods — he had unwittingly struck gold.

The founders quickly opened a second branch in Johannesburg. The chain retains strong South African links. Nando Duarte is in charge of the Johannesburg factory that produces all the company’s peri-peri sauce. And there is so much South African art in Nando’s restaurants worldwide that the chain claims to be the number one buyer of contemporary art from that country.

When Brozin and Duarte opened a third branch in South Africa, the Enthoven family put £57,000 into the business. It was a shrewd investment: today, Brozin and the Enthovens are the principal shareholders in the multi-million-pound empire. For its first 15 years, Nando’s was touch and go: it often ran out of cash, and Brozin had to go cap in hand to his bank manager to exceed his overdraft.

Between 1997 and 2003, the company was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but the share price never prospered. Since Nando’s has gone back into private hands, it has boomed.

Brozin remains chief executive, but devotes most of his time to philanthropy, while his empire goes on growing.

The outspoken tycoon still keeps an eye on the business and ensures the company sticks to what he calls the ‘don’t f*** withs’ of the business, which include Nando’s distinctive cockerel logo and the ‘people-centric business’.

Nando’s made a £58.2 million profit in Britain in 2013 and is expanding. It’s making so much money that, some have claimed, it is legally sheltering millions in complicated offshore accounts to cut its British tax bill.

The chain has denied this, saying it paid more than £12 million in corporation tax in 2013.

Still, Nando’s keeps snowballing. It plans to increase the number of British restaurants every year by 30 outlets, with the same number across the rest of the world.

Any politician who bottles that ever-growing peri-peri magic has got the keys to Downing Street for life.
