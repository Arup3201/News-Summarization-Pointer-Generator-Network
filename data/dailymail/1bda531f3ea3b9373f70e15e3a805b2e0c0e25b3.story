'Good Morning America' weather anchor Sam Champion is leaving ABC News after 25 years to join the Weather Channel.

Champion will anchor the network's new flagship morning show, which is set to debut in early 2014. Based at the Weather
Channel headquarters in Atlanta, he will also assume managing editor 
responsibilities at the network.

As The Weather Channel is part-owned by NBC Universal, the move may been seen as a desperate bid for the company to get back at GMA after it seized the ratings crown from 'Today' early this year.

'This is such an exciting opportunity,' Champion told TVNewser. 'It's a dream job for a weather junky like me.'

Champion has been part of the GMA team since 2006, but joined ABC News in 1988 as a local reporter at New York station WABC. His last day on GMA is Wednesday.

ABC News President Ben Sherwood said Champion's fellow meteorologist Ginger Zee will take over his weather responsibilities at 'GMA' and across the news division.

In a note to staff, Sherwood said Champion described his new job as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity.'

He thanked Champion for his more than
1,800 weather forecasts and applauded him traveling to almost every 
major weather event in the U.S. including broadcasting live 'from a raft
floating between polar icebergs' and dancing 'the salsa on "Despierta 
America."'

But Sherwood said the team would be in 'excellent hands' with Champion's storm chasing partner Zee.

'As you know, Ginger always rushes straight toward the eye of any storm and weaves cutting-edge science with human emotion to elevate our coverage,' he wrote.

He is the first talent departure at the 
No. 1 morning show in more than two years. According to TVNewser, Robin 
Roberts is close to signing a deal to stay with ABC News.

'Robin, George, Lara and Josh are the best friends and colleagues you could hope for,' Champion added. 'I'll always cherish the two and a half decades at ABC.'
