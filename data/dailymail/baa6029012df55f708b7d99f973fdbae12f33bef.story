The bull could be seen on the horizon as it was filmed coming through the cars on the motorway that had come to a standstill

Seconds later the bull began running at full speed towards the terrified drivers

The steer left and went to the road where he found several vehicles that repeatedly rammed.

The occupants of one vehicle recorded the images of how the bull caused damage to the car in which they traveled.

Among horrified screams and the facts, the occupants tried to chase the animal.

The Fiesta de San Roque starts with a Catholic mass and procession but in the evening towns celebrate with fun historical re-enactments, fireworks and parties.
