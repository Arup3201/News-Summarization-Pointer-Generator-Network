It's not every day that you sell your house for $1.62 million and get an invite to morning tea with the Prime Minister, but Jean and Tom Cheetham are no ordinary couple. 

At 100 and 103 years-of-age, Jean and Tom are probably Australia's oldest couple. Until recently, the inseparable pair lived independently in the same Mosman home they bought two days before their wedding in 1938. But all the furore over selling their house has also lead to an invitation to have morning tea with Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday to celebrate their centenarian status.

The Daily Telegraph reported that three generations of the Cheethams were at the auction to see the family home go under the hammer. The couple recently moved into a retirement home nearby and did not attend on Saturday.

Tom and Jean Cheetham's Mosman semi will be sold for the first time in 76 years this weekend as the couple move into a nursing home. The semi, which remains unchanged since the Cheethams bought it in 1938, is expected to fetch $1.4million at auction 

Tom and Jean's son, Kevin Cheetham, said he's unsure how much his parents paid for the house he was born in, and the property  next-door, all those years ago. He thinks it was around 3000 pounds for both.

The average house price in 1938 is thought to have been just 1000 pounds. It was the year Australia hosted the Empire Games (now Commonwealth Games) and celebrated its sesquicentennial, the 150th anniversary of European settlement.

Tom Cheetham was working at the Sydney GPO, translating morse code into ­telegrams when he took out a loan to buy the home, where the couple would raise their two children and celebrate their 100th birthdays.

The house has not changed much since the day the Cheethams moved in. 

'They put a garage in under the front of the home and they filled in the little veranda out the back, they built a workshed for my father and that’s about it,' Kevin Cheetham told the Mosman Daily.

Harcourts Real Estate agent Tom Forde says the semi is one of few unrenovated homes in the Mosman area, attracting a lot of interest because it offers a rare 'blank canvas' in one of Sydney's most sought after locations.

The home features character details including high, ornate ceilings and a period fireplace. The kitchen, in its original condition, reflects the austere style of the inter-war years in Australia. 

The semi is a short walk to Cremone shops and the Orpheum movie theatre - a walk Tom Cheethman made every day.

After recently moving into the Alexander Campbell House home, Mr Cheetham told the Mosman Daily of his marriage to Jean: 'She keeps me happy. I don't think people stick at marriage any more.'

Tom and Jean were also looking forward to meeting the Prime Minister for a special Kirribilli House reception.

'They're just thrilled about it,' their daughter-in-law Ann told Daily Mail Australia. 'Jean is still working out what she's going to wear.'
