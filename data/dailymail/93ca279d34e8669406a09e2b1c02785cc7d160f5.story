Death: Amy Bannister, the University of Derby student whose body was found in a tent at a campsite

A 21-year-old student who went missing has been found dead inside a tent at a campsite.

The body of Amy Bannister was found at the Peak District site in Buxton, Derbyshire, three days after she was reported missing to police.

The University of Derby student - originally from Nuneaton, Warwickshire - was found on Sunday evening after she was said to have vanished last Thursday.

Officers do not believe there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

Relatives and friends had been desperately appealing online for details on her whereabouts.

Today, they posted tributes to the zoology and psychology student on Twitter. Megan Smith from Nuneaton said: 'Can't even begin to explain how the whole family must feel. R.I.P. Amy Bannister.'

Jordan Hayward added on Twitter: 'Rest in peace Amy Bannister, you will be missed dearly.

Thoughts go out to the rest of her family for having to go through this.'

And Viki Fordham said on Facebook: 'I am so sorry to hear the loss of Amy.

'Thoughts go out to her friends and family. I am saddened by the fact that many never got to know her very well.'

Her cause of death has not yet been revealed - but an inquest was expected to be opened by the end of this week.

Miss Bannister was involved with the university's ramblers society and is believed to have celebrated her birthday earlier this month, on October 13.

She disappeared from her university home on Wednesday, prompting appeals by family and friends on Facebook and Twitter for details of her whereabouts.

A Derbyshire Constabulary spokesman 
said: ‘Police were called to a camp site in Buxton, High Peak at around 
5.30pm on Sunday, October 20 after concern was raised for the safety of 
someone staying at the site.

‘When officers arrived a woman was 
found dead inside a tent. The woman has now been identified as 
21-year-old Amy Bannister who was reported missing from Derby on 
Thursday, October 17. Police do not believe there to be any suspicious 
circumstances.’

A university spokesman said: ‘The University of Derby was saddened to hear of the tragic death of one of its students, Amy Bannister.

‘Amy enrolled at the university in 2012 and was studying on the BSc (Hons) Zoology and Psychology degree course. She was a valued and well liked student, and will be much missed by our community.

‘Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this moment in time. The university will continue to offer and provide support to anyone who felt close to Amy at the university.’
