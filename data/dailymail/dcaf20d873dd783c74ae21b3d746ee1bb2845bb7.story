There are over 1,800 living species of starfish, also known as sea stars, occurring in all the oceans of the world

The subjects of these mesmerising photos seem to glow with an ethereal inner luminescence that is almost out of this world.

And they are indeed from an environment that is alien to us; but it is under the sea, not above the sky, that they were captured.

Russian photographer and marine biologist Alexander Semenov took these incredible macro photographs of starfish beneath the waves of the White Sea, the Red Sea and the East Sea / Sea of Japan.

Asterias amurensis: Starfish can be found in depths 
ranging from the abyssal zone of greater than 20,000ft right up to where
 the tide laps against the seashore

Asterias rubens: Among the most familiar of 
marine creatures, starfish typically have a central disc and five arms, 
though some species can have many more than this

There are over 1,800 living species of starfish, also known as sea stars, occurring in all the oceans of the world.

They can be found in depths ranging from the abyssal zone of greater than 20,000ft right up to where the tide laps against the seashore.

Among the most familiar of marine creatures, starfish typically have a central disc and five arms, though some species can have many more than this.

Their upper surfaces may be smooth, granular or spiny and they attach to the sea bed with feet operated by a hydraulic system. The opportunistic feeders mostly eat other bottom-dwelling invertebrates.

Crossaster papposus: 'The unusual 
structures at the skin surface are common for echinoderms, it's just
 gills, skeleton elements and pedicellariae,' Mr Semenov said

Aphelasterias japonica: Mr Semenov, who has a 
degree in Zoology from Moscow State University, is head of 
the dive team at the White Sea Biological Station

Unknown: The luminescent glow of the specimens pictured by Mr Semenov is a result of the underwater strobe flash he uses

Asterina pectinifera: These pictures of starfish skin surfaces were made with high magnification ratios ranging from 1:2 to 2,5:1

Mithrodia clavigera: The skin of this particular specimen looks like the macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm

'This is just small collection of sea
 stars skin surface with high magnification ratio from 1:2 to 2,5:1 made
 recently in three different seas: the White Sea, the Red Sea and the 
Sea of Japan,' Mr Semenov said.

'All
 those unusual structures at the skin surface is very common for 
echinoderms, it's just gills, skeleton elements and pedicellariae.

'But
 look at it! I never cease surprised that nature shows amazing things. 
Variety of forms and colours among starfishes are very huge and you can 
hardly find two identical stars.'

Mr Semenov, who has a degree in Zoology from Lomonosov’s Moscow State University, is head of the dive team at the White Sea Biological Station.

He said: 'When I first began to experiment with sea life photography I tried shooting small invertebrates for fun with my own old dslr camera and without any professional lights or lenses.

'I collected the invertebrates under water and then I shot them in the lab. After two or three months of failure after failure I ended up with a few good pictures, which I’ve showed to the crew.

'It has inspired us to buy a semi-professional camera complete with underwater housing and strobes. Thus I’ve spent the following field season trying to shoot the same creatures, but this time in their environment.

'It was much more difficult, and I spent another two months without any significant results. But when you’re working at something every day, you inevitably get a lot of experience.

'Eventually I began to get interesting photos — one or two from each dive.

'Now after four years of practice I get a few good shots almost every time I dive but I still have a lot of things that need to be mastered in underwater photography.'
