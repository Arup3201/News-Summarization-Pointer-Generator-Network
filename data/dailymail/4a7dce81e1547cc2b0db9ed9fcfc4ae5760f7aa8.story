The karate-kicker is described as a black male in his late teens or early 20s and of slim, muscular build.

Investigating officer, Sergeant Adrian Brown from the Safer Travel Police Team, said: 'The elderly man is seen wandering through the bus station. He looks unsteady on his feet and may well be drunk.

'The footage shows him talking to people in the station and it appears the offenders have taken objection to whatever he was saying.

'But no matter what he said there is absolutely no excuse for the punishment they mete out on what is a vulnerable, defenceless victim.

'He is kicked to the floor and, whilst prone on the ground, another man jumps in the air and stamps on his chest.

'Both attackers run off leaving the victim unconscious on the floor before other members of the public come to his aid and call for an ambulance.

'It’s a sickening, cowardly attack and I’d urge anyone who believes they recognise the men, or has any information about the assault, to contact us.'
