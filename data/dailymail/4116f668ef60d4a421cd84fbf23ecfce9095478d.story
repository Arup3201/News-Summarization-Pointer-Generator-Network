Convicted: Sex offender James Burns worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy

A convicted sex offender worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy.

James Burns, 56, was employed as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport after passing a criminal record and counter terrorism check.

However, the checks failed to highlight 
his previous convictions for historic sexual assaults because the Police 
National Computer at that time did not include all offences from the 70s
 and 80s.

Burns was given tasks including patting down passengers during security checks carried out before travellers are allowed to board an aircraft.

But at the time he was offered the job in 2013 Burns was being investigated by police over new allegations of abusing a 16-year-old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons.

He failed to tell his bosses about the allegations and it was not until he was convicted after a trial at Manchester Crown Court earlier this year that Burns came clean with bosses as his past came to light.

Burns, Westhoughton, Bolton, was suspended on full pay after he was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault on a 16-year-old boy.

However, he has still not been sacked despite the fact that this week he was given a nine month sentence suspended for two years and a 12-month supervision order.

He was also placed on the sexual offenders register for ten years and subject to a sexual offences prevention order, which means he cannot be allowed unsupervised access to any children under 16, and must not seek to befriend any male under that age.

The court was told that between August and December in 2007, Burns assaulted the victim, telling him that he was gay, despite the fact he was married with a wife and children.

Burns also bombarded the teenager with sexually explicit and suggestive text messages, telling him that no one would believe him if he told anyone about the abuse.

The victim received up to 40 lewd text messages a night, and said he was showered with gifts and cash by Burns.

At the time of the offences Burns ran his own courier business, but his firm folded in 2010 and he later applied for and got the job at the airport.

Workplace: Burns worked as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates

The victim came forward in 2012 after seeking medical help from his GP.

During his trial it was revealed that Burns had previous convictions for indecent assault on a teenage boy in 1980 when he impersonated a police officer, and two convictions for public order offences in 1983 and 1984 for propositioning young men for sex in Bolton.

Burns worked as an aviation security officer at the airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates.

A Manchester Airport spokesman said: 'All security officers are given a criminal records check and a counter terrorism check, before they can be based at a UK airport, and the checks highlighted no disqualifying offences.

Security: A spokesman for Manchester Airport said that all staff underwent criminal checks before starting work

Still employed: An airport spokesman said that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job following his conviction

'Had the check shown up the offences from the 1980s Burns would have been disqualified from working at the airport.'

The spokesman added that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job.

The Police National Computer database is continually being updated with historic offences.

It is understood that the offences carried out by Burns had not been added to the database at the time he was arrested in 2012.
