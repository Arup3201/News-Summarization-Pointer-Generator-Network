Promotion beyond the grave: Joan Rivers's Facebook account posted a new message (pictured) to more than one million followers this morning saying she was swapping her four-year-old iPhone for the latest device

Accompanied by an image of what appeared to be an iPhone 4, the post read: 'This badass is being replaced by an iPhone 6 (not the fat one).

'I got this one in 2010, and after 4 years, my only complaint is that apps are now designed for bigger screens, and the battery is getting tired.

'Never had a case for it, since it was most beautiful on its own. Great achievement in design. Great product. #apple #iPhone #tech.'

The message, first noticed by TMZ, was seemingly set to appear on the social networking site as the result of a pre-negotiated deal with technology giant Apple, which released the latest iPhone today.

Rivers, who rose to fame as a guest on The Tonight Show, passed away aged 81 after undergoing a routine throat procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28.

During the surgery, she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest, before being rushed to nearby Mout Sinai hospital, where she was put on life support.  

However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4, prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness.

MailOnline has contacted Apple for comment.
