Kentucky Senator Rand Paul's wife, Kelley, is his chief cheerleader and 'secret asset' to winning political power, according to a new Vogue magazine profile of the Republican rising star.

The profile, written by Washington Post reporter Jason Horowitz, describes the blonde and quick-witted Kelley as 'more than merely a pretty image-softener' for the 'famously dour' senator. 

'Paul is more likeable when Kelley's around,' Horowitz writes.

She
 also collaborates on his speeches, joins him on the campaign trail, and
 until recently, worked as a political consultant for one of Paul's 
chief Republican rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. 

Kelley, 50, recently left the consulting firm she was working for, the Strategy Group for Media, 
presumably to avoid a  potential conflict of interest in working for Cruz as her family 
prepares to possibly launch a presidential campaign.

She now works on the board of Helping a Hero, a charity that helps wounded war veterans find housing. Horowitz notes that her work with the charity helps counter charges that Paul doesn't care about veterans issues since he's unilaterally against military conflict.

Kelley
 is wary of Paul's political aspirations, however, telling Horowitz that
 she's not totally sold on the idea of her husband running for 
president.

Sen. Rand Paul testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to examine reevaluating the effectiveness of Federal mandatory minimum sentences, on Capitol Hill Wednesday

'In this day 
and age, it's mostly about character assassination,' she said. 'When I 
think of the tens of millions of dollars in opposition research that 
they'd be aiming right at us and our family - that's what it's about.'

Rand Paul's mother suggests in the interview that her son's presidential campaign already 'feels real,' even though she says he won't announce it until after the 2014 midterm elections.

'Rand says he won’t declare that he’s going to run until after 2014,' Carol Paul said. 'Groundwork has to be set.' 

She added that her son thinks it's 'terribly early' to start a campaign.

Rand Paul and Kelley have three sons between the ages of 14 and 20. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who ran a failed campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
