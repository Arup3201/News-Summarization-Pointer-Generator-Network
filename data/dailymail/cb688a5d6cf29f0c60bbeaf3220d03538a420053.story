The first rule of Brazil versus Chile is: You do not talk about Brazil versus Chile. The second rule of Brazil versus Chile is: You do not talk about Brazil versus Chile.

Brazil may have come away with a 1-0 win through Firmino’s second-half strike, but this match between two South American rivals was more like a scene from cult ‘90s film Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt and Ed Norton get normal men kicking lumps out of each other every week, than the showpiece friendly expected.

As the film goes, the third rule of Fight Club: Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. No-one told the Chilean players as they repeatedly floored Neymar with challenge after challenge after challenge.

The Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Here at the Emirates Stadium it was 11 on 11.

The first savage blow came three minutes in. Brazilian enforcer Souza crunched Alexis Sanchez. 

Somewhere, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger winced and knew it would be a nervy 90 minutes watching his star player. It was clear this was going to be a ‘friendly’ in the very loosest terms.

Miiko Albornoz was next in referee Martin Atkinson’s book, nailing Neymar twice in a matter of minutes as the Chileans competed against each other for how many times they could take out Brazil’s star man.

Gary Medel tried the hardest, taking him down in a challenge then standing back up on his calf. The former Cardiff defender was lucky to remain on the pitch, perhaps helped by Neymar writhing around as if he had been tasered.

'They didn’t get much protection,' Dunga said of his players’ treatment after the game. 

On Medel’s stamp, he added: 'The decision is the referee’s. Chile has a great team, very dynamic, great fighting, but some players make mistakes. These days we have 300 cameras focusing on the action so you have to play football. There’s no other solution.' 

There were flashes of quality and skill, from Sanchez and Neymar mainly, the pair sending either side of the stadium into raptures of screeching and screaming with their every touch.

On 37 minutes, Neymar scooped the ball out of an opponent’s reach, which prompted their best chance of the first-half. The ball made its way to Marcelo and he crossed for Douglas Costa to the right of goal, who controlled the ball with his chest but could only volley over.

Neymar also came close with an in-swinging free kick from out on the right after 26 minutes, which almost tucked into the far right post before Claudio Bravo tipped it wide.

Early in the half Sanchez took a lovely touch to get clear and raced into the box, but was eventually blocked out.

The first 45 minutes were brought to a close by Fernandinho flying in with studs raised only to find air and Neymar being booked for tripping Gonzalo Jara. It was fitting. 

If anyone was expecting anything different in the second-half, they were duly disappointed 100 seconds into it when Mauricio Isla went through the back of Neymar, who was down clutching his ankles yet again. 

Sanchez started taking the game by the scruff of the neck, while the others were too busy taking each other by it, and making things happen.

He got the wrong side of Miranda on 63 minutes and was brought down, earning the Brazil defender a yellow card. Three minutes later he beat three men before being tripped by substitute Willian and moments later he was spinning and shimmying past more again. The resulting free kicks, however, were poor.

Finally, after 72 minutes of the match, there was a chance of real note - and the Brazilian’s scored it. Substitute Firmino was played through by a wonderful pass from right-back Danilo and he rounded the goalkeeper to score.

Dunga was satisified with victory, he said: 'It's true Chile controlled the game, but we had more chances at goal. So it wasn't just luck - we deserved to win. We are building a competitive team, working through obstacles very well, played against a very strong France team, changed six players but stayed stable and strong.'

Managers across Europe with a vested interest in this game would have been relieved to hear the final whistle blow and no major injuries incurred.

By the end, seven yellow cards had been brandished and it was incredible there were no reds. But the match is over now and, remember, the first rule of Brazil versus Chile is: You do not talk about Brazil versus Chile.
