Andy Coulson, who is being investigated over whether he had hidden assets as Crown prosecutors try to recoup £750,000

Disgraced Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson is being investigated over whether he has hidden assets as Crown prosecutors try to recoup £750,000 in costs from him.

The 46-year-old, jailed for 18 months for phone hacking, must account for millions of pounds received after he quit as News of the World editor in 2007.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘A lot of money passed through Mr Coulson’s hands and there doesn’t seem to be very much left. We want to investigate where the money has gone.’

Coulson received a £600,000 settlement when he resigned as editor of the News of the World and was recruited by the Tories months later as director of communications on £475,000 a year, which fell to £180,000 when he moved to No10 in 2010.

The married father-of-three resigned as Mr Cameron’s spin doctor in January 2011 and set up a PR consultancy with his wife Eloise but has not worked full-time since he was charged with phone hacking in 2012.

His legal costs in the trial were covered by his former employers at News International, the publishers of the News of the World, after he took the firm to the High Court to force them to pay.

It is not clear if the Rupert Murdoch newspaper empire will also cover his share of the CPS costs. If it does not the court will assess Coulson’s own assets.

His assets include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons, although it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs.

The couple sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury.

Mr Edis said the prosecution would investigate if other assets had been hidden.

He told the Old Bailey: ‘In a situation such as this, where someone anticipates they might be convicted having been charged in 2012, it is not at all uncommon for transfers of money to take place whereby they are no longer in his ownership but might still be accessible to him if the need should arise.’

Coulson was convicted of phone hacking following an eight-month trial and was given an 18-month jail sentence.

His co-accused Rebekah Brooks, her husband Charlie and former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner were all acquitted and have asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds.

Their applications are due to be considered at a hearing later this year. Mr Edis warned the bill to the taxpayer could run to millions of pounds.

Coulson and former royal editor Clive Goodman face a possible retrial on two charges of making illegal payments to police officers, on which the jury failed to reach verdicts.

Coulson has been held in top-security Belmarsh Prison in South East London while a decision is made over the retrial.

Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said he was ‘concerned’ that Coulson was still in Belmarsh and would write to the prison governor.

A non-violent criminal serving a comparatively short sentence would normally only be taken to Belmarsh for assessment before being transferred to a lower security jail.

Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘I am concerned to hear that Mr Coulson is remaining at Belmarsh because of the possibility of the retrial taking place.

‘I think that the governor should be informed that any retrial there should be – if there were to be one – is some way down the line.’
