A puppy that went missing in New York more than two years ago has turned up alive and well some 1,000 miles away in Florida.

Nika, a six-month-old toy fox terrier, vanished from the backyard of her home in Newburgh, New York, in May 2012, leaving owner Giuseppe DiBella heartbroken.

'It was one of the most horrible days of my life,' Mr DiBella said. He had been doing yard work in front of his home for only a few minutes when he believes someone snatched the three-pound dog from her leash.

A devastated Mr Di Bella immediately went to the police and spent a year searching animal shelters for his  pet and distributing missing-dog posters.

But it wasn't until last week that he had any news regarding the whereabouts of his beloved pooch.

He received a phone call from police in Ocala, Florida, informing him that Nika had been found on the doorstep of local home.

'I said, 'All right, I'm coming,"' Mr DiBella  told New York's CBS 2. '"Where are you?" They said, "We are in Marion County." 

'I said, "Where in Marion County?" They said, "In Florida." I said, "I'm in New York!"'

Nika, who was underweight and looked like she could have been neglected, had been taken to an Ocala animal shelter where she was identified by her microchip.

'I was feeling, like, biblical - when the son comes back to the father, you know, those kind of things,' Mr DiBella said.

A family friend in Florida is caring for the little dog until she can be reunited with her owner, who still lives in New York with his other dog Martha. It is still not clear how Nika traveled the 1,090 miles or so to Florida.

'Nika's story is a beautiful example of the value of microchips,' said Marion County Animal Services director Deborah Horvath. 'Collars and tags can be removed or lost, but microchips provide a lifelong means of identification. 

'Microchips help reunite countless families, whether the stray animal is one or 1,000 miles away from home. We encourage all pet owners to microchip their pets.'

According to a 2012 study of animal shelters by the Humane Society, more than half (52 percent) of dogs with microchips were reunited with their owners. Just 22 per cent of dogs without microchips ever returned home.

It is still not known how little Nika traveled more than 1,000 miles to where she was found in Florida
