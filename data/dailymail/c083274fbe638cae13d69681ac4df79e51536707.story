For the first time ever, sci-fi epic Defiance is boldly going where no game has gone before...and interconnecting a TV programme with an MMO shooter.

Developed by Trion Worlds for the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, the series takes place on Earth, which is war-ravaged and inhabited by humans and aliens.

Gunning it:  You are able to select your species before kitting out customisable armour, weapons and abilities

It combines the intense action of a third-person shooter with the persistence, scale and customisation of an MMO, while its TV counterpart exudes the scope, story and character-driven drama of a classic sci-fi epic. 

Cleverly, because they exist in a single universe, the show (to be shown on Syfy) and the game influence each other – both evolving over time with actions in both mediums affecting the overarching narrative.

Thankfully, the gameplay has a creative team behind the likes of RIFT, Everquest and Borderlands, working on it. The result is a wonderfully dark open world, capable of catering for thousands of other live players.

Although MMO game are not renowned for state-of-the-art visuals, Defiance holds up well across all platforms - its impressive draw distance helping to emphasise the sheer scale of the planet and the monumental war that plagues it.

There's also an impressive weather system in place. Often huge lightning storms can rip you and your vehicles to pieces, suddenly shifting priorities from death count to out-and-out survival. 

Target in sight: The game uses the perspective perhaps best known from the Gears of War series

As expected, you can customise your character. With each class comes different abilities, such as active camo for the Sharpshooter and speed boost for the Shock.

You can pick to play as either a human or alien, modify your appearance and select and upgrade weapons.

All weapons, vehicles and artistic direction have been developed in parallel with the series, and as a result, sound and look exactly the same across the mediums.

Hit the road: The world is epic in scale so, thankfully, there are vehicles to make travelling a pleasure

Playing like a much more refined Brute Force with a dash of Halo, there is also a P-v-P mode, which can cater for battles of up to 32 players.

Sadly, it will be next April when we find out if Defiance’s gamble pays off. But on this evidence, it looks like a sure bet.
