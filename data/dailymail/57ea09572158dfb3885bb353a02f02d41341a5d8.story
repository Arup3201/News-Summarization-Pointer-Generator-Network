Its intriguing mysteries and gentle brand of humour have proved a hit with audiences worldwide.

But fans of BBC detective series Jonathan Creek were left shocked after the latest episode of the popular drama used a highly-offensive racist word, apparently without realising its meaning.

Viewers immediately took to Twitter, revealing their disbelief that the word ‘Jigaboo’ – a derogatory term used to describe a black person – had featured in the episode which was broadcast at 9pm last Friday.

The BBC has apologised after the word 'Jigaboo' appeared on a Scrabble board on Jonathan Creek

It was included in a scene in which actors John Bird and June Whitfield were playing Scrabble. A close-up of the board was shown on camera, with the word clearly visible at the top of the screen.

The characters, seemingly oblivious to the word’s meaning, are then shown innocently discussing whether it is a real word or not. The incident was unconnected to the rest of the episode, which saw the super sleuth trying to solve a kidnapping case.

Such was the level of shock among some viewers, that they immediately posted messages online questioning if they had heard correctly.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Did someone just say “jigaboo” on Jonathan Creek? Is that allowed?’ 

Valentine Smith said: ‘Oh dear BBC. In Jonathan Creek one of the nonsense Scrabble words was a very offensive racist word. You must try harder to be less offensive.’

Another, calling themselves Nasa, added: ‘Racist scrabble #Jonathan Creek’, while another said: ‘This unnecessary racist slur appeared on Friday’s episode of Jonathan Creek. Any chance the BBC will apologise?’

The show stars comedian Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek, a magician's assistant turned detective who specialises in solving seemingly supernatural deaths with a comedy twist

It is written by David Renwick, who has also penned a string of much-loved BBC series including One Foot in the Grave and Love Soup, as well as the ITV series Hot Metal.

The programme was first broadcast in 1997, running until 2004. The show won the Bafta for Best Drama Series in 1998.

Following a five-year hiatus, the series returned for a one-off special on 1 January 2009, while a further 90-minute special was shown in 2010.

A third special aired at Easter last year, and the fifth series started last month and is watched by around 5.5m viewers.

The BBC has frequently been accused of trying too hard to be politically correct. In 2012, the corporation told its journalists not to describe Abu Qatada as an extremist in order to avoid making a ‘value judgement’. They said he should be referred to as radical instead.

It was in 2011 that the BBC faced a backlash from leading presenters over suggestions that they should use ‘religiously neutral’ terms instead of ‘BC’ or ‘AD’ to avoid causing non-Christians offence.

The BBC last night apologised for featuring the word ‘Jigaboo’ in an episode of Jonathan Creek.

They claimed that the writer has been searching for words to include in a scene where the characters were playing a ‘Klingon’ version of Scrabble.

A spokesman said: ‘In searching for obscure words for a Klingon-themed game of Scrabble, a word was unwittingly featured in the board game that it since transpires has negative connotations. No offence was intended.’
