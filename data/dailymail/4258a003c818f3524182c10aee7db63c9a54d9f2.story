Despite its many successes, Apple has never been known for its charitable giving - perhaps until now.

Now established as America’s most valuable company, Apple appears to be doing a shift toward more philanthropic endeavours.

In fact, founder Steve Jobs was notorious for his scant contributions to good causes.

Cheap? Steve Jobs was notorious for his scant contributions to good causes, and believed that Apple's contributions to the public were its devices

Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, told the New York Post that the late Apple founder wasn't one for monetary donations.

She said that he felt the devices Apple was delivering to the public were charitable enough.

Ms Palmer told the paper: 'Steve Jobs had a lot of concerns about how philanthropy worked and what the value of it was. He saw the products he was making as a contribution to society.'

But that all changed under new CEO Tim Cook, who took the reins at the technology giant last year.

The Post reported that Stanford University hospitals received $50million, while another $50million was set aside for the Product Red, the Africa AIDS charity founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver.

Still, that $100million total is still well behind what other companies are dishing out.

The top charitable giver in 2011 was Berkshire Hathaway, fronted by billionaire Warren Buffett, which donated a staggering $1.5billion total.

The company is followed closely by Walmart and Exxon Mobil. Apple is eighth on the list.

Another
one of the big changes that Cook made when he took over at Apple was a 
charitable giving campaign for employees, in which the company matches 
contributions by employees.

Palmer
told the Post: 'You see a real difference under Tim Cook. He has talked
more openly about charitable giving by Apple. It sounds like a changed 
attitude.'

Apple got even richer two weeks ago with a major victory over Samsung in a patent dispute after a jury found the South Korean company copied critical features of the iPhone and iPad.

Apple will now be awarded $1.05billion in damages, according to the court ruling.
