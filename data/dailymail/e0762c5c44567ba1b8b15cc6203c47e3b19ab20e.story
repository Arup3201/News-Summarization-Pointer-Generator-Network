A tiny cottage in the back garden of another property has gone on sale for just under £200,000.

Located in a garden in West Didsbury, Manchester, the small brick building has been converted into a home and is now being marketed as a ‘two bedroom detached house’.

The premium price is down to the property's desirable location - the suburb has a reputation as one of Greater Manchester’s property hotspots.

The two-bedroom house is in the back garden of another house and is for sale for £200,000

Desirable: The high price is down to its location in West Didsbury, a popular Manchester suburb

For the same price you could buy a five bedroom, semi-detached house in Longsight, just under five miles away, or gaze out over the city from an apartment in the skyline-dominating Beetham Tower.

House hunters could even snap up 13 houses in Mere Lane, in nearby Rochdale, where homes have sold for just £15,000.

Boasting two bedrooms, a bathroom and open plan kitchen and lounge, it comes with an asking price of £199,950. And whoever buys the property also becomes owner of the garden behind the house, which is converted into six flats.

The estate agent describes it as a 'fully refurbished detached annexe'

The cottage is believed to have been built at the same time as the red brick semi-detached house it stands behind - but has only recently been restored so it can be lived in.

Marketed by Didsbury estate agents Philip James Kennedy, it is described as a ‘fully refurbished detached annexe’ with contemporary presentation.

The listing adds: 'Located within strolling to West Didsbury village and the new Metrolink station, offered for sale with no vendor chain. 

'The stylish accommodation consists of living room, opening through to stylish high gloss kitchen with integrated appliances, two bedrooms and contemporary bathroom suite.'

Options: The £200,000 could also buy an apartment in the Manchester skyline-dominating Beetham Tower
