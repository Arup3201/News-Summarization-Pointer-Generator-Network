It almost looks like it is sleeping, but sadly, this little frog will not jump again as it froze solid trying to cross a lake in Norway.

It is thought that a sudden rise in temperatures fooled the hibernating amphibian and it ventured out across the lake to find a girlfriend.

However, as the lake froze, possibly overnight, the frog would have returned to hibernation out in the open, and died from the cold.

Photographer Svein Nordrum, 54, discovered the creature caught out by freezing conditions.

He said: ‘I was out skating for a couple of hours and, suddenly; I saw something on the surface of the ice. When I saw it was a frog, frozen stiff, I was quite shocked. I have never seen anything like it before.’

He said: ‘It was a sad thing to see, but at the same time it was quite beautiful. I think this frog was trying to find a hole in the ice and swim back to shore once the lake started to freeze.

‘The poor thing obviously didn't make it and was left stuck to the ice I don't think it would have been there for very long as something would have taken it to eat.’

Mr Nordrum captured the shot while skating on Lake Bindingsvann, just outside of Oslo. He said: ‘It was a once-in-a-lifetime photograph. I am very lucky to have captured it.’

Silviu
 Perovan, conservation coordinator at UK conservation charity Froglife, 
said the frog could have been looking for a mate when it froze.

He said: ‘It is fairly common to see frogs crossing areas covered in snow. Some frogs hibernate on the water but most hibernate on land in the vicinity of a body of water.

‘I think that for whatever reason the frog became active again during hibernation. There was probably a slightly warmer period which led the frog to become active, perhaps for reproduction.

‘It
 was probably in search of a mate and was crossing the lake when the 
temperature dropped again, probably overnight, and it was frozen to the 
lake.’

Although frogs normally hibernate during the winter, a raise in temperature could have fooled the amphibian to think that it was springtime, and it awoke to find a mate
