A warehouse worker is celebrating after discovering a winning £50,000 lottery ticket - the day before it was due to expire.

James Wilson, 28, was clearing out an old wallet when he stumbled across the EuroMillions ticket.

He decided to double check the numbers and was shocked to realise he had matched all five in the  draw from March 28.

James Wilson, 28, was clearing out an old wallet when he stumbled across a EuroMillions ticket which won him more than £50,000 - when it had just one day left before expiring

It was at this point he noticed he has just one day left to claim his £51,232.90 prize.

Mr Wilson, from Bradley Stoke, Bristol, said: 'I called Camelot straight away but because it was so late in the evening, their lines were closed until the morning.

'I can't tell you how relieved I was when I got through to someone the following morning and they confirmed I wasn't too late to claim my prize.

'When I met with The National Lottery adviser, he told me that Camelot had been publishing details of the missing ticket through the press for the past six months.

'But I had no idea. It was purely luck that I stumbled upon the ticket before it expired.'

Mr Wilson said he has recently got married and was living with his wife at their parents' house.

But now the couple will be putting part of the winnings towards a deposit for a home of their own.

Mr Wilson is also hoping to use some of the money to get back into bike racing, as well as treating his wife to a new car.

'This win will make such a massive difference to us,' he added.

'We worked hard and managed to save up for our wedding but couldn't afford our own house too.

'Now we can start house hunting and hopefully afford a couple of treats along the way.'

Mr Wilson said he plays EuroMillions every time there is a Rollover, and that he will continue playing after his win.
