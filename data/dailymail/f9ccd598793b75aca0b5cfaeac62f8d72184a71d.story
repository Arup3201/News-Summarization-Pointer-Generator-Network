One month after his release from a Cuban prison, Alan Gross received a chamber-wide standing ovation during Tuesday’s State of the Union address.

The aid worker had spent the past five years languishing in a Cuban prison before being freed by President Raul Castro in a prisoner exchange just before Christmas.

When he arrived back on American soil last month, Gross was 100 pounds lighter and missing several of his teeth.

On Tuesday night Gross still looked gaunt and was still minus most of his front teeth as he took pride of place as a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama.

Gross still broke out into a big smile and waved both fists triumphantly from the visitors' gallery when President Obama welcomed him home.

‘After years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan.’

Gross was joined by wife Judy and earlier the pair had posed for a selfie in front of the Twitter Mirror installed at the White House especially for the event.

When president Obama spoke about Cuba during his address he said the previous policy was 'long past its expiration date.' 

'When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new,' he said.

'Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.'

Gross, 65, had been returned to the U.S. after being freed by President Raul Castro in a reported prisoner exchange that officials said heralds a policy overhaul toward the isolated communist country. 

'What a blessing it is to be a citizen of this country!' Gross had said when he returned to the U.S. on December 17 

Appearing in decent health and walking without support, Gross had been accompanied by his wife of 45 years, Judy, as he spoke to reporters at a Washington law office shortly after flying home from Cuba.

He said he has learned the lesson during five years in Cuban captivity that freedom is not free. The former prisoner said he hoped that the U.S. and Cuba can now build new relations.

'Two wrongs never make a right,' Gross said. 'I truly hope that we can now get beyond these mutually belligerent policies.

In another breakthrough, Obama revealed that he may very well visit the Caribbean nation--a first for a sitting president since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.

'I don’t have any current plans, but let's see how things evolve,' he told ABC News. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest went a step further, saying, 'I certainly wouldn't rule out a presidential visit.'

Despite his ordeal - he has lost 100lb, vision in his right eye and many of his teeth - Mr Gross said he has utmost respect and fondness for Cuba's people and said he was pained 'to see them treated so unjustly'.

'In no way are they responsible for the ordeal to which my family and I have been subjected,' Gross said, describing the vast majority of Cubans as 'incredibly kind, generous and talented'. 

Gross said knowing he wasn't forgotten by people in the U.S. 'was crucial to my survival'.

The father of two daughters, Mr Gross lived in the affluent Washington suburb of Potomac, Maryland, before his capture.

Gross was a longtime supporter of Jewish causes and a career development consultant who traveled the world on private contracts before taking his Cuba assignment. He had only once previously visited Cuba and spoke very limited Spanish.

Gross worked for Maryland-based Development Alternatives Inc (DAI), which had a $6 million deal with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to promote democracy and support political dissidents. Gross signed two contracts with DAI paying him a total of $590,000 to deliver telecommunications equipment over 20 months.

During five trips to Cuba in 2009, Gross imported banned satellite communications devices and other high-tech gear in his luggage and helped install it at Jewish centers in Havana, Santiago and Camaguey.

Cuban officials arrested him in his hotel room on Dec. 3, 2009, just before he had planned to return home.

Gross sued DAI and the U.S. government for $60 million, saying he was inadequately informed of the dangers and illegality of his mission. He settled with DAI for an undisclosed sum and a judge threw out his suit against the United States, a decision upheld on appeal.

While incarcerated, Gross morphed from a gadget geek to an embittered critic of the U.S. and Cuban governments. 

He lost 100 pounds from his original 254 pounds. His spirits dimmed after his mother died of cancer in June, and he stopped seeing doctors, his wife, or officials of the U.S. interests section shortly thereafter.
