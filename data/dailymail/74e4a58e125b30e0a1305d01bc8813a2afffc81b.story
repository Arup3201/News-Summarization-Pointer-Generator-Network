While travellers will know of the must-see foliage in Vermont and other parts of northeastern US, some of the best locations for admiring the autumnal colours are also some of the most unexpected.

And while you may have to wait a bit longer for the leaves to turn in Kyoto, Japan, once they do, stunning displays of red are common alongside the region's signature architecture.

Not to be overlooked, the National Parks in Colorado, like the Rocky Mountain National Park, look like they belong on the back of a postcard.
