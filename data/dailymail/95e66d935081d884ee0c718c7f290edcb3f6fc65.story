The National Security Agency has been accused of using Google cookies to pinpoint targets the government wants to hack.

In a NSA presentation slide released by Edward Snowden and seen by the Washington Post, the agency appeared to be using internet tracking techniques usually used by advertisers.

While the Pref Cookies reportedly being used don't reveal personal information, they can uniquely identify a person's browser.

Leak: The NSA slide is the latest agency information allegedly released by Edward Snowden

The NSA and GCHQ in the UK have been using the tracking files to identify potential targets who are using the internet, according to the documents.

As well as listing visits to websites, the cookies can identify an individual's communications so that hacking software can be sent out.

The slide seen by the Washington Post showed the tracking devices 'enable remote exploitation' though how this has been used against targets was not revealed.

While cookies could help the NSA track an individual it cannot be used to help the agency sort through vast amounts of information.

It works only if someone has already been identified as a target.

Another slide suggested that the NSA was also collecting location data from by mobile apps in programÂ  code-named HAPPYFOOT.

Tracking: Cookies created by Google and other browsers identify web users for advertising

The information is said to help the NSA map internet addresses to physical locations more 
precisely than with geolocation 
services.

'This shows a link between the sort of 
tracking that's done by websites for analytics and advertising and NSA 
exploitation activities,' Ed Felten, a computer scientist at 
Princeton, said.

Cookies are small files that identify internet users for ad targeting and other uses.

Tools to opt out or block cookies have limited reach.

A unique Pref Cookie is created by Google whenever someone connects to one of its services, such as Maps.

The Pref Cookie code lets Google send tailored adverts to the user.

The NSA slide suggests the agency has been using the unique code to gain access to potential targets.

'By allowing themselves to be tracked for analytic
 or advertising at least some users are making themselves more 
vulnerable to exploitation,' he added.

Since June, newspapers across the world 
have revealed the scope of government spying by publishing classified 
documents leaked by Snowden, a former NSA contract analyst.

While the latest slide suggested the NSA used the devices, it did not explain how the agency got hold of Pref Cookies or whether Google cooperated with sharing the data.

When approached by the Post, the NSA declined to comment.

But a spokesman said: 'As we've said before, NSA, within its lawful mission 
to collect foreign intelligence to protect the United States, uses 
intelligence tools to understand the intent of foreign adversaries and 
prevent them from bringing harm to innocent Americans.'

Google also declined to comment, buts its chief executive, Larry Page, has called for limits on court-approved surveillance requests.

'The security of users' data is critical, which 
is why we've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency 
around government requests for information,' Mr Page said.

'This is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world.'
