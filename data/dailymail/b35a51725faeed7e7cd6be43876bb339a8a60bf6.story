The man appointed by Pope Francis to clean up the Vatican's scandal-hit bank allegedly had a gay affair with a Swiss soldier and had to be rescued after getting stuck in a lift with a rent boy.

Monsignor Battista Ricca was recently appointed as Francis's new prelate with responsibility for the Vatican bank, the Institute for Religious Works which has been hit by years of financial scandal.

But according to an expose by weekly Italian news magazine L'Espresso, Monsignor Ricca's own record is less than spotless.

Allegations: Pope Francis is pictured (centre) meeting Monsignor Battista Ricca last month. Ricca is alleged to have only got the job as Vatican bank prelate after the powerful 'gay lobby' airbrushed his CV

The publication has claimed that Monsignor Ricca only got the position as IoR prelate after the supposedly powerful 'gay lobby' in the Vatican airbrushed his CV.

According to the claims, Ricca took a Vatican diplomatic post in Uruguay in 1999 and caused shockwaves within the church when moved his Swiss army captain lover Patrick Haari in.

The publication claims that the allegations have been confirmed by a number of bishops, priests and laity in Uruguay.

Ricca was eventually moved to Trinidad and Tobago and then recalled to Rome in 2002.

Admission: Pope Francis admitted for the first time last month that a powerful 'gay lobby' does exist within the Vatican

The same year, he allegedly found himself in more hot water when he was attacked at a notorious cruising ground.

Soon afterward, Ricca had to be rescued by firemen when he got trapped in a lift.

He was reportedly found inside with a youth who was known to local police.

As well as his role as primate of the IoR, Ricca is also in charge of the Pope's residential quarters at the Vatican.

But the Vatican has denied the claims.

Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi described the claims as 'not credible'.

The allegations come a month after Pope Francis acknowledged the existence of a 'gay lobby' inside the Vatican's secretive administration for the first time.

Speaking during an audience with Latin American Catholics last month, the Argentine Pontiff said that there was a 'current of corruption' in the Roman Curia - the central governing body of the Catholic Church.

He also admitted the existence of a long-rumoured 'gay lobby' in the Curia, and hinted that he might take action over the issue.

The Vatican is no stranger to gay sex scandals.

In 2010, it was reported that one of Pope Benedict's ceremonial ushers and a member of the Vatican choir were involved in a gay prostitution ring.
