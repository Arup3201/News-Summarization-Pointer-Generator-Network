Tribute: The family of Elijah Bond have praised the 'amazing' Sapper after he died following an IED attack

The family of a British soldier who died following an explosion in Afghanistan today paid tribute to his ability to 'light up a room as much as he lit up our lives'.

Sapper Elijah Bond, 24, from 35 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, died in Queen Elizabeth NHS Hospital in Birmingham on Thursday.

He was brought back to the UK following the blast from an improvised explosive device in the Nahr-e Saraj District of Helmand Province on Tuesday.

Spr Bond, from St Austell, Cornwall, was a member of a team that was conducting an engineer reconnaissance task.

His colleagues provided immediate first aid following the explosion, before he was evacuated by helicopter to the military hospital in Camp Bastion where he received further treatment. He was then flown to the hospital in Birmingham, where he died of his wounds.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said Spr Bond had a vibrant personality, but in quieter moments proved to be an excellent chess player.

He leaves behind his mother Lizz, father Mark, brother Isaac, and sisters Kimberley, Jose and Bethany.

His family said in a statement: 'Elijah Cooper Bond left the world in the way he chose to live his life.

'He was a beautiful son, amazing brother, a proud uncle and our best friend.

'From a wicked grin to a righteous smile he could light up a room as much as he lit up our lives, so mischievous and fun yet grounded and down to earth.

'He will forever be a piece of us and remain in our hearts.

'We are thankful for the memories we have been given and the precious time we spent with him. We have faith in the sure and certain knowledge that we will be reunited together again.'

A total of 391 British troops have died since the start of operations in Afghanistan in 2001.

Spr Bond joined the Corps of Royal Engineers in August 2008. After two years of training he joined 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron, a part of 35 Engineer Regiment based in Paderborn, Germany, and was launched straight into pre-deployment training for Afghanistan.

He volunteered and excelled at the general purpose machine gunners' course, and completed the Pashtu language course.

Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Copsey, Commanding Officer, 35 Engineer Regiment, said: 'Spr Elijah Bond will be sadly missed by his close-knit troop and squadron. His lively and outgoing nature was founded on an inner confidence that saw him excel during his time in the Royal Engineers.

'He was a rising star within his squadron and he had a bright future ahead of him.'

Lt Col Copsey said he was 'a first rate soldier' and noted his 'complete reliability, enthusiasm and commitment'.

He added: 'Spr Elijah Bond's friendly exterior belied a soldier who was physically robust, mentally tough, and always intent on doing the utmost for his team mates.

'It was whilst on an engineer reconnaissance patrol helping to plan vital infrastructure for the local population that he paid the ultimate price. Tragically he gave his life in order to improve the lives of others.'

Major Guy Boxall, Officer Commanding 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 35 Engineer Regiment, said: 'He was injured whilst on an important and invaluable task; an engineer reconnaissance patrol for a future project to improve the lives of the local Afghans.

'The squadron has been devastated by the loss of a brother.'

Sapper Pete Broxton from 7 Troop, 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 35 Engineer Regiment, added: 'Bondy was the life of the party, so full of fun and always bringing a smile to everyone's face.

'He could always get a laugh out of anyone with his witty jokes, and he could do a like-for-like impression of many of his mates, bringing us all to tears of laughter.'
