Michael Chopra has revealed he is on the verge of moving to the Indian Super League.

The 30-year-old's career has taken a staggering dip over the last three years as he looks set to leave English football behind.

Chopra, who was released by Blackpool last month after failing to score for the Championship club all season, tweeted that he is ready for pastures new - although didn't go into specific detail.

'Looking forward to playing in @ILeagueOfficial @ISuperL @IndiaSportsTV hopefully get things sorted in the next week or two exciting times,' he said.

Chopra played 20 times for the Seasiders last season after being dumped by Ipswich Town this time last year.

The former Cardiff striker has only found the net five times in the past two seasons.

His off-the-field antics have been the subject of intense media scrutiny. Paul Ince fined the player £15,000 and banned him from training for an ill-advised tweet in January.
