The cremated remains of either a human or animal have been discovered inside the Jordan-Hare Stadium where this year’s dramatic Iron Bowl college football game was played in Alabama on Saturday night.

The bones and ashes were found near the 40-yeard line by a team cleaning the grounds after fans had stormed the field to celebrate Auburn beating Alabama.

Auburn officials are not sure if the remains are human, but bone fragments were discovered scattered within the ashes.

Ashes to ashes: The cremated remains of either a human or animal were discovered inside the Jordan-Hare Stadium

A mess: The ashes were found Monday by Auburn officials cleaning the stadium, which was littered with thousands of orange pom-pom shakers and damaged by fans trampling the field on Saturday night

'Grandma or grandma's dog:' Scott McElroy, associate professor for turfgrass and weed science at Auburn University said it was not known whether the remains were human or animal

‘It could have been grandma or it could have been grandma's dog,’ said Scott McElroy, associate professor for turfgrass and weed science at Auburn University.

McElroy saw the remains for the first time at 11 a.m. on Monday, according to al.com.

Auburn officials say it is not the first time a fan has dumped the remains of a former family member on the field.

‘It happens a lot more than you think,’ McElroy said. ‘People want their final resting place to be Jordan-Hare Stadium.’

Cremated remains can quickly kill the grass and contaminate the soil, so the turf and grounds crew removed the grass and two to three inches of soil at the spot Monday.

True fans: Bushes were damaged as fans charged the field after Saturday's win. It is not the first time a fan has dumped the remains of a former family member on the field

‘People think this is the last resting place and I'm doing a good thing by putting out organic matter on the field, but it's actually quite detrimental to the grass,’ McElroy said.

Auburn officials were busy Monday cleaning the stadium, which was littered with thousands of orange pom-pom shakers and discolored and damaged by the fans trampling in the field.

Bushes along the sideline and the south end zone were damaged as fans charged the field, creating ‘cow trails’ among the broken branches, McElroy told al.com.

Flower beds in the southeast corner were also destroyed, but that can be repaired by simply replanting the flowers.

‘There was some damage but no one was badly hurt as far as I know and it was a good celebration,’ McElroy said.
