Baroness Thatcher memorabilia flooded the internet yesterday as her death brought a wave of fresh interest in the Iron Lady.

Thatcher egg cups, nut crackers and teapots were just some of the bizarre collectibles that sparked bidding wars on auction site eBay.

Signed copies of the Baroness’s memoirs, collectable newspapers and photographs are also up for grabs.

Meanwhile a glazed white Toby Jug featuring Thatcher sitting on a high-backed throne is currently attracting bids of £89.

Internet entrepreneur Gavin Hodge, 30, from Warwick, who has made thousands of pounds from buying and selling collectable items from eBay, said: ‘It is always been a reality that when someone high profile dies, memorabilia associated with them goes up in value.

‘Signed autographed copies of books, cards and letters will probably fetch the highest prices while novelty goods like dolls and toys will probably go up 20 or 30 per cent.

‘Some people might think it’s ghoulish for people to profit from someone’s death but if you look back in history, masterpieces only got valuable after the artist had died.

‘As a champion of the free market, I think Maggie would probably have approved.’

Another collector found out that his extraordinary haul of Margaret Thatcher memorabilia is now worth £100,000.

Jason Cullen has spent two decades as an avid collector of the former Prime Minister's autograph.

Although he was just six years old when she became Prime Minister, he became fascinated with her career after she left Downing Street and started buying up all the memorabilia he could get his hands on.

Boom: The business selling signed photographs and other items has taken off since Lady Thatcher's death

Close: A picture of Lady Thatcher with her good friend, U.S. President Ronald Reagan

Valuable: This signed copy of Lady Thatcher's memoir is worth more than £6,000 due to its rarity

Rare: A card from the 1984 London Economic Summit signed by the then Prime Minister

The items signed by Lady Thatcher 
range from a numbered copy of her book The Downing Street Years valued 
at more than £6,000 to a Number 10 book plate worth £240.

Mr
Cullen, 40, has started an online business selling the memorabilia from
his home in Leeds - and since the great Prime Minister died on Monday 
he has received orders equivalent to several months of normal trading.

He opted against raising his prices after the death despite facing far greater demand than he normally would.

'Margaret Thatcher is one of Britain's most famous figures in recent years,' he said.

'I own the world's largest collection of Margaret Thatcher autographs available to purchase and the Iron Lady's signature commands a huge interest both in Britain and across the world.

'People either love her or loathe her, but what no-one can deny is that she altered the history of the UK - and the world - forever.'
