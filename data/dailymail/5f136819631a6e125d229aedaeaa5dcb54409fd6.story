Andy Murray made the perfect start to his clay-court campaign with a battling victory over Nicolas Almagro in the second round of Mutua Madrid Open.

The Scot, who had a first-round bye, had to hang tough in the deciding set on his way to a 6-1, 1-6, 6-4 victory over the world No 24.

Pushed all the way: Andy Murray was made to work for his win over Nicolas Almagro

It was a very tough draw for the Wimbledon champion, who was playing his first match in a month.Almagro is among the most dangerous players in the world on clay, as he showed by beating Rafael Nadal in Barcelona two weeks ago.

But the Spaniard is also erratic and, apparently troubled by a foot injury, he offered little in the first set.

Murray raced into a 5-0 lead, looking extremely sharp after two weeks training on clay in Valencia, and it was all Almagro could do to avoid a love set.

Murray broke serve again at the start of the second and it looked like it would be a comfortable evening but Almagro gained a foothold with a break back and on that the match turned.

The Spaniard sensed an opportunity and began to show just what a talent he is, overpowering Murray with a run of six games in a row.

The Scot knew he needed to dig in at the beginning of the decider and he did, saving three break points in the third game.

Almagro did not drop a point on serve until the eighth game of the set, but Murray kept nudging ahead and he took his chance when his opponent served to stay in the match.

It was Murray's first win over a Spaniard on clay since beating Tommy Robredo here in 2009 and arguably one of the best of his career on the red stuff.

Murray signed the camera at the end of the match with the word 'Bally' and a heart, a tribute to former British No 1 Elena Baltacha, who died from cancer on Sunday.

The pair had known each other since they were part of the same Scottish team as juniors and Murray's mother Judy remained a close friend of Baltacha.

Murray took part in a tribute to the 30-year-old in Madrid on Monday, and he told reporters in the Spanish capital: 'It's been a tough 10 days or so.

'I kind of had an idea what was going on with Elena because my mum is obviously very close with her and her husband.'

He added: 'It does make you think about things and you do realise how lucky you are, and that the most important thing is your health.

'The more time that passes the more people will celebrate everything that Bally did because she was a great character, a great person, she got everything she could out of her potential.

'Everyone wants to be Wimbledon champion and to be number one in the world but not everyone can have that. The best thing you can do is achieve your potential and I believe she did that. That's a big credit to her.

'It's something that every single day you're going to think about. But it's just tough for everyone today. I just wanted to try to go out and play and win, and try to enjoy it. Right now is not easy.'
