The worms are back and looking better than ever in Worms The Revolution Collection - and you can see the latest trailer here before anyone else.

This latest worms outing contains the most recent release, Revolution, complete with three dlc packs, called Mars, Funfair and Medieval Tales.

You also get Worms 2 Armageddon which comes with five expansion packs, including Battle, Puzzle, Forts, Time Attack and Retro.

Gaming at its purist: Although many games these days focus on graphics, it's refreshing to see Worms put gameplay before anything else. That being said, art direction remains inspired

Worms Revolution is rendered in 3D and introduces dynamic water effects, exploding physics objects and four different class acts to choose from. Although a multiplayer game at heart, there are a host of single-player missions and puzzles, too.

Worms 2 Armageddon has also had a makeover - boasting new visuals and some apocalyptic weapons. These include the Super Sheep, Napalm Strikes, Earthquakes and the Concrete Donkey.

Worms The Revolution Collection is out on May 3.
