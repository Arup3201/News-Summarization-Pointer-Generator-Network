A vet who was trampled by a cow was left seriously ill after doctors missed her injuries and sent her home from hospital with nothing but painkillers.

Amy Jennings, 23, suffered broken ribs and a collapsed lung when she was crushed by the half-ton animal as she examined cattle at a farm.

But hospital doctors failed to order X-rays which would have highlighted the damage and instead said she had merely suffered painful bruising to her ribs.

Accident: Amy Jennings had been called to a farm in Halam, Nottinghamshire to treat a cow with breathing difficulties when a second animal knocked her off her feet and trampled on the left side of her chest

Error: Staff at Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire failed to take X-rays that would have revealed Miss Jennings was suffering from 'massive' internal bleeding caused by three broken ribs and a collapsed lung

The newly qualified vet was discharged from King’s Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, with paracetamol.

Two days later she collapsed at home and was taken to the major trauma unit at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham with ‘massive’ internal bleeding.

Doctors were stunned to discover she had three broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

Miss Jennings had an emergency procedure to drain three pints of blood from her chest. Medics described her condition as serious. She was sent home after six days but had to return on Friday for a second chest drain.

Yesterday the graduate, from Bingham, Nottinghamshire, criticised the care she received at the £320million King’s Mill Hospital.

She said a CT scan, which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body, had not only revealed the broken ribs but also a ‘massive’ accumulation of air and blood in the lung.

Emergency: When she collapsed two days after being trampled, Miss Jennings was rushed to the major trauma centre at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham to have three pints of blood drained from her chest

Poor treatment: Instead of having X-rays taken, Miss Jennings was moved to the side of the A&E department at Kings Mill Hospital where a nurse deemed her condition not serious enough for a bay on a ward

Miss Jennings added: ‘I had an emergency chest drain fitted, which immediately drained 1.8 litres of blood from my chest, had two units of blood transfused and was in a serious condition. Doctors at the QMC could not believe that King’s Mill had failed to X-ray me, given the nature of my injury, as this would have shown the fractured ribs and possibly some fluid or air in my chest.’

Miss Jennings, who qualified as a vet in July at the Royal Veterinary College, was injured three weeks ago after being called out to a farm in Halam, Nottinghamshire.

As she was tending to a cow with breathing difficulties, another cow charged at her and knocked her off her feet before trampling her left side. The farmer called an ambulance and she was taken to King’s Mill Hospital.

She said she waited for 45 minutes in the walk-in area of the Accident and Emergency department before she was even assessed by a nurse.

She added: ‘The nurse gave me some pain relief tablets and left me to sit in the waiting area. After a further hour-and-a-half wait I finally saw the doctor.

‘He listened to my chest and felt my ribs. He then picked a discharge card off the wall and told me I had bruised ribs, which would be sore for a while.

‘No X-ray was taken despite the magnitude of the injury and the nature of the force a half-ton cow can apply to a human body.’ Her mother Christine, 51, a pharmacist, said: ‘Her life was put at risk because a doctor failed to do his job properly.

Anger: Amy Jennings has hit out at the care she received at Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire

She was sent home with paracetamol. She could have died.’

Dr Ben Owens, service director for emergency care at Sherwood Forest Hospitals, which runs King’s Mill Hospital, has apologised to Miss Jennings.

He said: ‘We will carry out a full and comprehensive investigation to understand what went wrong and where lessons can be learnt. We will continue to discuss with Miss Jennings the concerns she has and keep her informed of our investigation.’
