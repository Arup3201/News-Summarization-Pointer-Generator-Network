Police say Jason Brown, whose license has been suspended 41 times, gave a fake name after being pulled over in Yaphank, New York, on Saturday after an officer noticed his minivan driving erratically

A man who has had his license suspended 41 times was nabbed again over the weekend in New York.  

A Suffolk County police officer pulled Jason Brown over on Saturday afternoon in Yaphank after noticing the suspect's minivan was being driven erratically. 

Police say even though Brown gave a fake name to Highway Patrol Officer Matthew DeWitt, the officer determined the suspect's New York State driver’s license had been suspended 41 times.

Officer DeWitt also 'observed marijuana in plain view within the van'.

At that point, Brown, 36, was taken to the 5th Precinct in Patchogue for processing. 

During processing, Officer DeWitt 'discovered Brown had hidden on his person quantities of heroin and cocaine'.

Brown, of Mastic Beach, was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, criminal impersonation, unlawful possession of marijuana and two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance.

He was also given a traffic summons for failure to maintain or stay within a lane of travel and his van was impounded.

After being held at the precinct overnight, Brown was arraigned at First District Court in Central Islip.
