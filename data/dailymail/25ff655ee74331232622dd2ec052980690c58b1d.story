Nick Clegg today names the price Labour or the Tories will have to pay for him to support them in a coalition after the general election.

The Lib Dem leader will use the launch of the front page of his party manifesto to set out demands for £8billion for the NHS, protection for nurseries and colleges from cuts and an increase in the amount workers can use before paying income tax.

Five commitments on the front page will form the basis of coalition negotiations in the event of a hung parliament after May 7.

The full manifesto will be released once the election campaign gets under way in April.

But the Lib Dems say the policies on the front page will be key demands for any future power-sharing deal.

It includes promises to protect spending from nursery to college throughout the next parliament,to balance the budget 'fairly', to cut taxes by raising the tax-free allowance to £12,500, to invest £8billion in improving the NHS, and to protect the environment.

However, there is no mention of scrapping university tuition fees – the flagship policy the party ditched when it came to power in 2010 which lead to a catastrophic collapse in support for the Lib Dems. 

The Lib Dems  dismissed suggestions that the party had lost credibility on education after breaking its pledge.

'Don't judge us by the one policy we couldn't deliver. Judge us by the policies that we did deliver,' one source said.

'Our credibility rests on the things that we have done. In every single area on these five policies our record in government is bloody good.'

In a speech in the Tory-held seat of Oxford West and Abingdon, Mr Clegg will say the Lib Dems had been 'relentless' in government in ensuring the life chances of children had been at the heart of the coalition's programme.

He will say that in a new government, the Lib Dems would act to protect schools budgets in real terms as well as funding for early years and colleges.

'The Liberal Democrats will prioritise education, just as we have done over the last five years because nothing is more central to what we believe. Nothing is more important to creating a fairer society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential,' he is expected to say.

'Other parties will have their own priorities. And for that reason we know we cannot take the progress we have made in education for granted.' 

The Lib Dems have already announced plans for an £8billion tax hike after the election, in what was seen as laying the groundwork for a coalition with Labour.

In a significant shift towards Labour’s position, Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would pursue a higher ratio of tax rises to spending cuts if they find themselves still in power again after the election.

He said this would involve ‘at least’ £8 billion in tax rises, more than half of which have yet to be set out.
