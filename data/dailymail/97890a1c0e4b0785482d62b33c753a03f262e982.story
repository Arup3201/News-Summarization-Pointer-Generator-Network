A brave young mother has taken her two children on a heartbreaking last holiday to Disneyland for what could be their last Christmas together.

Jade Harris, 23, who has bone and lung cancer, said her greatest wish was to go on the dream holiday of a lifetime to Disneyland in Paris with Amelia, four, and Iestyn, three.

And with the help of her friends and friends and family, who raised £500, Ms Harris got her wish.

The single mother's dream was to take her two children to Disneyland in Paris and thanks to her friends and family, she got her wish

The family had their perfect Christmas watching the Disney parade and meeting the characters from their favourite films.

Ms Harris, of Pontardawe, near Swansea, South Wales, said: 'It was my one dream, to take my children to Disneyland.

'I am so grateful for everyone's help in getting me there. It was a perfect time with busy days in the park and cosy nights curled up by the fires in our hotel.

'My children are my life and I am only getting through this and staying strong because of them.'

She added: 'Seeing their faces as they watched the parade and waved at their favourite characters was so wonderful.

'I'll treasure the beautiful memories we made forever.'

She was only able to book the trip before Christmas, because her friends and family raised £500

'I am so grateful for everyone's help in getting me there,' she said, adding her children, pictured, are 'her life'

Her children are still too young to fully understand the severity of their mother's condition but they know she isn't well.

The single mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year when doctors found a tumour the size of a grapefruit.

After gruelling chemotherapy and internal radiotherapy she was given the all clear. 

But just months later the cancer had returned in her lungs and bones.

Now, she is receiving more chemotherapy and regular blood transfusions because her platelet count is so low, to prolong her life.

'It's every child's dream to visit Disneyland and to be able to give that to my kids while I'm still here was so precious,' she added

She said: 'I just take every day as it comes and I want this Christmas to be as special as it can be. Nobody knows what the future holds.

'Since becoming ill I see how much people really do take life for granted. I really how precious life is and I just take each day as it comes and just live in the moment.'

'It's every child's dream to visit Disneyland and to be able to give that to my kids while I'm still here was so precious.

'We enjoyed every magical moment.

'My children are my world and they are the reason I carry on.'

The four-night trip to Paris included flights for Ms Harris, the children and her mother Kathryn.

They stayed in the resort in Disney's Sequoia Lodge and Ms Harris added she has been touched by the 'incredible' support from friends and family whose generosity meant she could book the trip for the week before Christmas.
