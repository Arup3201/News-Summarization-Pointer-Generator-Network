If the last four opening World Cup games are anything to by then we are in for a treat tonight when Brazil kick things off against Croatia in Sao Paulo.

Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side are hot favourites to win the trophy on home soil and will be desperate to start with a bang against their European opponents.

Sportsmail has taken an enjoyable trip down memory lane to look at the explosive starts to the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups.

1998: June 10, Stade de France, Saint-Denis

Brazil 2-1 Scotland

Picture the scene – Paris in glorious sunshine, a new stadium packed with 80,000 fans, the reigning world champions. And Scotland. A backline of Tom Boyd, Christian Dailly and the two Colins, Hendry and Calderwood, were handed the unenviable task of keeping Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Bebeto quiet. And for more than 300 seconds they did, before centre-back Cesar Sampaio nodded a Rivaldo corner past Hibernian goalkeeper Jim Leighton.

The goal stirred Craig Brown’s side into life, and rather than a resounding Brazil win like many predicted, the Scots were able to force their South American opponents back.

Seven minutes before half-time they were level, through John Collins, who swept a penalty beyond the dive of Taffarel after a Sampaio foul on Kevin Gallacher.

Scotland repelled wave after wave of Brazil attacks in the second half before disaster struck in the 78th minute. A hopeful chipped pass towards the overlapping Cafu was flicked at goal, and Leighton could only push the ball into the chest of the recovering Boyd.

With Leighton out of position time appeared to stop as the ball slowly bounced off Boyd and into the bottom corner, to hand Brazil a 2-1 win.

2002: May 31, Seoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul

France 0-1 Senegal

Even without Zinedine Zidane, who was ruled out of the opening match through injury, France were expected to roll over a Senegal side making their first appearance at a World Cup. El-Hadji Diouf and Papa Bouba Diop, who had just finished a season in Ligue 1 with Lens at the time, had other ideas. They, along with their nine tireless team-mates, produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history to stun the defending champions and captivate a global audience, very few of whom would have given them a chance before kick-off.

In midfield, Diop dominated Patrick Vieira, of Senegalese origin, and Emmanuel Petit. The Senegal star, nicknamed ‘The Cupboard’ on account of his considerable frame, scored the only goal of the game in the 30th minute, scooping the ball home following fine play from Diouf, who terrorised the French defence throughout.

France’s coach Roger Lemerre threw on Christophe Dugarry and Djibril Cisse in an attempt to turn the tide, but as the reigning champions pushed on Senegal looked the more likely to score, and Khalilou Fadiga glancing a header off the crossbar late on.

2006: June 9, Allianz Arena, Munich

Germany 4-2 Costa Rica

Barclays Premier League fans will have enjoyed seeing former Derby County favourite Paulo Wanchope strike twice against the hosts in Munich on the opening day of the 2006 World Cup, although his brace was not enough to stop Germany marching to the top of Group A. 

The Allianz Arena was the stage for some fabulous long-range strikes, as Jurgen Klinsmann’s side started their campaign with a 4-2 win. Philipp Lahm got things started in the sixth minute, cutting in from his station on the left and curling an unstoppable shot into the top right corner.

But six minutes later Costa Rica were level, Wanchope sweeping the ball past Jens Lehmann for his first of the afternoon. Before the mid-point of the first half Germany were back in front, when Miroslav Klose poked home Bastian Schweinsteiger’s off-target effort.

For 44 minutes, quite amazingly considering the thunderous opening to the match, there were no goals, until Klose added his second from close range after his initial header was saved by Jose Porras.

Party pooper: Striker Paulo Wanchope (centre) scored twice for Costa Rica against hosts Germany in 2006

Not long after Wanchope reminded English fans of his pedigree, clipping the ball over Lehmann to draw the hosts back to 3-2 and set up an anxious finale.

Cue, Torsten Frings. The scraggly-haired midfielder, who had threatened from long-range throughout the game, lashed the ball into the top corner from 35 yards to settle German nerves and ensure the hosts started the World Cup with a win.

2010: June 11, Soccer City, Johannesburg

South Africa 1-1 Mexico

As the South Africa team emerged on to the pitch at Soccer City after dancing their way down the tunnel they were given a thunderous reception from their vibrant fans in the stands. And despite a fairly low-key first half, which saw Mexico go close through Guillerme Franco and have a Carlos Vela goal chalked off when he was quite clearly onside, the game burst to life in the 55th minute courtesy of Siphiwe Tshabalala’s left foot.

Crystal Palace favourite Kagisho Dikgacoi was the architect, scything the Mexico defence open with a perfect pass into the left-hand channel. Tshabalala hooked the ball into his stride, powered past Ricardo Osorio and then unleashed a rocket into the far corner hit with such venom it left Oscar Perez in the Mexico goal helpless.

Giovani Dos Santos tried to replicate Tshabalala’s strike up the other end, but somehow Itumeleng Khune deflected his effort over. Mexico’s pressure eventually paid off when Rafael Marquez showed great composure to control the ball and curl a shot past Khune in the penalty area, though Katlego Mphela nearly restored South Africa’s lead when he struck the base of the post late on. A night that will always be remembered for Tshabalala and his thunderous left boot.
