From pulling petals off daisies to counting letters in people’s names, people have used many dubious methods to work out whether they have a future with someone they fancy.

But now a new home test claims to tell the difference between a fleeting fling and a relationship that could mean a couple live happily ever after, by using a combination of genetic and psychological tests.

The kit offers an ‘affordable way to test chemistry and compatibility long before a life-changing commitment is made, between a couple,’ according to Ontario, Canada-based firm, Instant Chemistry, which devised the tests.

The CAD$149 (£81) test comprises two ‘quick and non-invasive’ tests.

Instant Chemistry collects a DNA sample from an individual  using a cheek swab and identifies the genetic make-up of part of their major histocompatibility complex (MHC/HLA) and serotonin uptake transporter (5-HTTLPR).

Both people in the relationship must stow their spit in provided tubes and send the samples to the company so that it can analyse DNA.

The results are shown in an ‘IC BioCompatibilty Score’ which is used to assess the person’s compatibility with other individuals based on their IC BioCompability Score.

Analysis of the genetic make-up of two individuals can help determine whether they will experience physical attraction and compatibility when they meet for the first time. Or if the couple is already together this assessment can help determine strengths and weaknesses in overall compatibility in order to improve relationship success, the company said.

Scientists test for six gene variants in the HLA system that are associated with increased physical attraction and relationship success.

They also analyse ‘serotonin uptake transporter,’ which is associated with emotional response and marital success.

Couples who have taken the test can log in to a secure online portal, complete the personality test and look at their compatibility results.

The company claims to have come up with the first ever at-home compatibility test that is backed by scientific and psychological research – but it comes at a cost of CAD$149 (US$164; £81).

The kit comprises three tests including one that compares the genetic strands of two people to report on their long-term compatibility and chemistry.

‘Through intensive research scientists have found that long-term relationship satisfaction stems from two constants – your DNA and core personality – and how those match up with your partners,’ said Dr Sara Seabrooke, chief science officer of Instant Chemistry.

‘The science behind Instant Chemistry’s kits is based on this research. By combining biological and psychological tests, we can determine how compatible you are with your partner and provide ways to offset incompatibilities, for example changing a small habit.’

The Couples Kit contains two biological tests, one based on relationship satisfaction and the other on long-term chemistry.

The 
Relationship Satisfaction test, which is backed by research from 
University of California, Berkeley, determines how two people’s brains 
process serotonin, revealing differences in their emotional reactions to
 varying situations.

Serotonin is associated with relationship success and marital success.

The
 second biological test, called Long-Term Chemistry, is based on 20 
years of research and looks at how well partners’ genetic makeup 
complements each other.

People taking the test send away a sample of their spit and let the scientists carry out the two biological tests, as well as taking an online personality test. They can log in to the company's website to see how they are compatible in different ways - an example is pictured

This information can be used to look at key components of DNA, such as how partners react to scent - a proven way to determine how physically attracted partners will be years from now, the firm explained.

Finally, a couple can do an online psychological compatibility test to identify each other’s personality traits and what they mean in terms of stability and happiness in a relationship.

‘Combined with the biological tests, Instant Chemistry is able to determine the underlying compatibility of partners and recognise what will help a relationship to further grow,’ the company claims.

If compatibility is lacking, Instant Chemistry provides ways to detect conflict before it arises and advice on ways to improve a relationship.
