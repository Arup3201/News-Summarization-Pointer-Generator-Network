A car-lover's classic Morris Minor is still going strong after clocking up 300,000 miles in its 49 years on the road.

Pensioner John Davies' two-door car's odometer has gone around the clock three times since it was registered on November 1, 1965.

But Mr Davies, 84, from Aberystwyth, west Wales, can still rely on the Morris Minor 100 for his shopping trips, and wouldn't dream of swapping the motor for a newer model.

Retired train driver Mr Davies bought the car for just £50 from his brother Arthur 30 years ago to save it from the scrapheap. 

'My brother was the second owner and he bought the Morris Minor for £350,' he said.

'Arthur left it at the garage one day and thought it would be scrapped, but I ended up driving it home and it was fine.

'I paid £900 to get it all sorted and get it on the road and it's still got the same engine it had when it was built.

'But it's only ever broken down once when a piston blew - and even then I managed to drive it up a hill and to the garage.'

Widower Mr Davies gets the car serviced every year and also takes it to a specialist garage in Bristol for repairs.

He attributes the cars longevity to doing everything by the book and has no plans to ever sell it.

The great-grandfather said: 'Last year I did 1,153 miles in it and I spend about £15 a fortnight on petrol.

'Insurance for this year cost me £166.85, which isn't too bad.

'I don't want anything else, it's very comfortable, convenient and reliable.'
