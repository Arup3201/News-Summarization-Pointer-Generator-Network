A lawyer for three of the men accused of the brutal rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi claims his clients have been tortured and coerced into admitting the crime.

He made the accusation as he entered court this morning where the five suspects appeared for a second time amid heavy security, charged with abduction, rape and murder.

Manohar Lal Sharma told the BBC that one of the men had been tortured for 10 days.

Mr Sharma said he plans to represent bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh as well as a third man Akshay Thakur and they planned to plead not guilty.

Claims: Policemen report for duty at the court. A lawyer for three of the men accused of the brutal rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman claims his clients have been tortured into admitting the crime

'This 22-year-old boy was picked up from his village,' said Mr Sharma.

'He was tortured for 10 days. He was coerced into admission. He's unable to speak now.

'All these people have been tortured badly. It's under pressure that they have made statements in court.'

Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat refused to comment, citing legal restrictions.

Undecided: Today's hearing was expected to result in the case being sent to a special 'fast-track' court, but a decision was not made as the court ruled that the charge-sheet needed more scrutiny

Today's hearing was expected to result in the case being sent to a special 'fast-track' court, but a decision was not made as the court ruled that the charge-sheet needed more scrutiny.

'They are innocent,' said Mr Sharma, who added that he took the case in part to confront the police over 'how manipulated evidence is placed for fixing the innocent people.'

A sixth suspect, who is thought to be 17, will be tried separately in a youth court if it is confirmed he is a minor.

Five men have been charged with attacking the 23-year-old woman and her male companion on a bus as it was driven through streets of India's capital.

The woman was raped and assaulted with a metal bar on December 16 and eventually died of her injuries.

Another lawyer, VK Anand, says he also represents the two Singh brothers. It is not yet clear if the other defendants have lawyers.

Authorities have charged the men with murder, rape and other crimes that could bring the death penalty.

A sixth suspect, who is 17, is 
expected to be tried in a juvenile court where the maximum sentence 
would be three years in a reform facility.

Prosecutor
Rajiv Mohan said last week that a DNA test confirmed that the blood of 
the victim matched blood stains found on the clothes of all the accused.
