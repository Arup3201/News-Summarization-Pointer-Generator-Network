The Ohio-based companies that provide the U.S. Army with Abrams tanks, once again proved to be one of the big winners when congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill this week.

The new defense spending bill will include $120 million for the 70-ton tanks – even though the army has repeatedly said it doesn't need them.

It is the third year in a row that congress has disregarded the army's expressed wish to suspend tank building and upgrades.

For the third year in a row, congress has disregarded the army's stated desire to suspend tank building and upgrades and has passed a defense spending bill that includes $120 million on Abrams tanks

In a statement, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said that congress 'recognizes the necessity of the Abrams tank to our national security and authorizes an additional $120 million for Abrams tank upgrades.

'This provision keeps the production lines open in Lima, Ohio, and ensures that our skilled, technical workers are protected.'

Turner chairs the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee and will retain that position in the next Congress, reports Fox News. 

His district includes the General Dynamics Land Systems plant in Lima, Ohio, the only U.S. manufacturer of tanks.

The tank debate between the army and congress goes back to 2012 when General Ray Odierno, the army chief of staff testified that 'we don't need the tanks.

'Our tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We're in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don't need.'

Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the hulking Abrams tank weigh 70-ton and the army had suggested that production lines could be kept open through foreign sales

Then congress voted for another $183 million for tanks despite Odierno's argument that the army was seeking to become a lighter force.

'If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way,' he said at the time.

The current Abrams upgrade program approved by congress calls for improving gas mileage by decreasing idle times and also  improvements to the tank's sights and sensors.

But politics is keeping the Abrams production line rolling as the deal protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank's many suppliers are located.

Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved.

The money, they say, is a modest investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills from being lost if the Abrams line were to be shut down.

The Lima plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities, which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars.

The facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of General Dynamics, a major defense contractor that spent close to $11million last year on lobbying, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

The plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Mayor David Berger.

But the facility is still crucial to the local economy. 'All of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company's spending probably have about a $100million impact annually,' Berger said.
