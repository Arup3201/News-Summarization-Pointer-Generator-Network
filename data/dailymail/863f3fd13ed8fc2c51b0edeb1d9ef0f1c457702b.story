Families forking out for flights to the sun, together with all the summer clothes and travel insurance, are paying a staggering £2billion ‘holiday tax’, it is claimed.

For a combination of Air Passenger Duty, VAT and insurance tax are imposing a huge financial burden on families who already struggle to afford a foreign break.

New research from the TaxPayers’ Alliance warns UK flight taxes are the most expensive in the world, adding hundreds of pounds to some holidays.

Checking in: Research from the TaxPayers' Alliance warns UK flight taxes are the most expensive in the world

It suggests that a family of four 
travelling to Florida over the summer are likely to have paid some £350 
in various taxes before they take off.

It
says this figure is up by some £150 – 75per cent – since 2008, making 
it more difficult as every year passes for families to afford a long 
haul holiday.

The Alliance suggests the total UK tax bill gathered from British holidaymakers is up by £500million since 2008 to an estimated £2billion.

Its research claims that a family of six 
travelling to Spain will have faced an average tax bill of £187 on their
flights and holiday purchases in the UK.

And a couple travelling to Australia will have faced an average tax bill of £254 on their flights and holiday purchases.

The Alliance said the tax take equates to an average of £56 for every many woman and child who flies overseas each year.

Air Passenger Duty on flights out of Britain is charged in several bands according to the distance of the flight and the class of ticket.

The tax starts at £13 per passenger on the cheapest short haul budget flights and rises to a maximum of £188.

Alliance chief executive, Matthew Sinclair, said: ‘People work hard all year to make ends meet, despite high taxes and rising prices.

‘They look forward to a holiday as a blessed relief but sadly the tax man is waiting even when they try to take a well-earned break.

Florida: A family of four travelling to Florida will pay £65 a head or £240 in APD (Air Passenger Duty) alone, says the TaxPayers' Alliance

‘Britain's exceptionally high taxes on
flights in particular make holidays much more expensive, as well as 
making it harder for Britain to compete as a destination for tourists 
and business investment.

‘The Government should cut Air Passenger Duty and make flying more affordable.’

A
family of four travelling to Florida will pay £65 a head or £240 in APD
alone. The VAT on holiday purchases, such as summer dresses, shorts, 
books and beauty products, would add another £62, while the tax on 
holiday insurance would be another £28.

The
Alliance said the APD on a party of six flying to Spain would add up to
£78, with VAT on holiday purchases of £56 and travel insurance tax of 
£42.

The APD on a couple 
flying to Australia works out at  £184, plus VAT on purchases for the 
trip estimated at £56 and insurance tax at £14.
