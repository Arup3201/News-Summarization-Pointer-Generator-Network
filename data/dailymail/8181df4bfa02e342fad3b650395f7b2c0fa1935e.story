Doomed: Roberto Curti was high on drugs when he was chased by police in Sydney. He died after being held down and tasered 14 times. His chase and arrest were captured on CCTV (pictured)

Australian police who used taser guns
 repeatedly on a Brazilian student behaved with an ‘ungoverned pack 
mentality’ - like schoolboys from the novel Lord of the Flies - a coroner said 
today.

Roberto Curti, 21, died after he was 
pinned down by police, handcuffed and hit with 14 taser shots after a late night 
chase through the streets of Sydney earlier this year.

In a series of scathing findings following the two week inquest in Sydney, New South Wales coroner Mary Jerram recommended that five officers involved in the struggle be considered for disciplinary charges, but stopped short of calling for a criminal investigation into their actions.

No definite cause of Mr Curti’s death was found during the inquest, but the coroner was told he might have choked while he was being restrained face-down on the footpath after he had had capsicum spray used on him and had been hit by tasers.

The coroner said that one probationary constable, Daniel Barling, who had used his taser right up against Mr Curti’s shirtless body in what is known as ‘drive-stun mode’ five times, had shown ‘appalling’ judgement and had behaved in a thuggish manner.

Miss Jerram said some officers had shown an ‘ungoverned pack mentality’ and acted ‘recklessly and dangerously’.

Some police, she said, ‘threw themselves’ into the confrontation ‘like schoolboys in Lord of the Flies’ and recommended their actions be referred to the Police Integrity Commission.

Lord of the Flies is the title of a classic novel by English author William Golding which tells how a group of British boys form a tribe and try to govern themselves, with savage results, after they become trapped on an island following a plane crash.

Tragedy: The cause of Mr Curti's death is not certain, but he may have choked while being held down on his front by the police

Crime: Mr Curti was caught on camera in a shop where he stole two packets of biscuits. The shop's owner did not think the incident worth reporting, but a woman outside raised the alarm

Chase: The Brazilian student, who had taken LSD that night, is chased through the streets by officers in Sydney

‘Roberto’s only foes 
during his ordeal were the police,’ said the coroner, who had heard that
 the student had taken the hallucinogen drug LSD earlier, had stolen two
 packets of biscuits from a shop and was in a psychotic state when the 
police chase began.

‘There was no victim other than Roberto, no member of the public who suffered an iota from his delusionary fear,' she said.

‘Certainly he had taken an illicit drug, as has become all too common in today’s society, but he was guilty of no serious offence, he was proferring no threat to anyone, there was no attempt by police [to] consider his mental state.’

The inquest heard that the manager of the shop from which the biscuits were taken considered the theft so harmless he did not call police – but a cleaner outside thought she had witnessed an armed robbery and raised the alarm.

Physical: Officers wrestle with Mr Curti in the middle of the road as they try to restrain him

Pinned down: The student is shown with a hand on his throat as the police pin him to the ground. It is believed he may have choked when he was rolled onto his front

Shock: He appears to have a taser gun held against his body as the police continue to try to restrain him

Miss Jerram said that none of the 
taser stuns after Mr Curti was brought to the ground were justified and 
that the police had been ‘reckless, careless, dangerous and excessively 
forceful.’

Aside
 from singling out probationary constable Barling for criticism, Miss 
Jerram also faulted the behaviour of the most senior officer at the 
scene of the struggle, Inspector Greg Cooper.

His evidence, she said, had been ‘so self-contradictory, self-serving and obscure’ it wasn’t worth repeating.

'Both his actions during the event 
and his attempts to exonerate himself and blame more junior officers 
afterwards are little more than contemptible,’ said the coroner.

Criticised: The coroner criticised the police officers involved for behaving with a 'pack mentality' and recommended that five be considered for disciplinary action

Handing down an open verdict on the cause of Mr Curti’s death, Miss Jerram recommended an ‘immediate review’ of standard operating procedures for tasers and capsicum spray.

She also asked the police commissioner to consider whether probationary constables should be allowed to continue using tasers.

After the findings were delivered, Mr Curti’s brother-in-law, Michael Reynolds, said his family was still in shock.

Referring to the young man they knew as their ‘beloved Beto’, Mr Reynolds called for criminal charges to be laid against police directly involved in the struggle.

‘Nothing will ever bring Beto back, but we continue to push for those responsible to face the consequences of their appalling behaviour on that night,’ said Mr Reynolds.
