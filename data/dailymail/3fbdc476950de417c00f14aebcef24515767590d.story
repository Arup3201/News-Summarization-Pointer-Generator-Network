Men who were bitter at losing a game of beer pong at a house party opened fire on partygoers, striking one, police have said.

Decoris 'Red' Rucker Jr., 24, and Chris 'Crazy Chris' Hackett allegedly played the drinking game with three other men in the backyard of a home in Ames, Texas early Monday when an argument erupted.

The men pulled out guns and started running through the home 'firing wildly' at partygoers, witnesses told Liberty County Sheriff Deputy Stephanie Walden, who responded to the call at 1.20am.

'Several witnesses told Deputy Walden that five men from the Cleveland area... became upset about losing at a game,' Captain Ken DeFoore of Liberty County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Outburst: Decoris 'Red' Rucker Jr., 24, allegedly opened fire after his team lost a game of beer pong at an early-morning house party on Monday. One girl was shot and Rucker also sustained a gunshot wound to his leg

After opening fire, the men fled the scene of the shooting in a 2006 silver Buick.

One partygoer, 19-year-old Daihza Jarde Jackson, suffered a bullet wound to her left thigh and was rushed by ambulance to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont, where she is in stable condition.

Just over an hour later, Rucker - one of the alleged shooters - arrived at the emergency room at a Kingwood Hospital with a gun shot wound to his leg.

'Rucker reported to authorities there that he had been shot at some unknown location in the Cleveland area,' police said.

Authorities recovered several spent hulls from the scent and investigations are underway.

No arrests have yet been made, but authorities expect to charge the men with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, as well as other possible charges.

'As of this early stage of the investigation, no arrests have been made and more statements are being taken from the large number of witnesses attending the party,' the statement goes on to read. 

Previous reports show that Rucker was arrested in May after he was allegedly found to be in possession of a cache of illegal substances, including Ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.

His criminal background includes two burglary of a habitation charges, assaults and other other drug charges, and in 2011, he was sought for questioning by police in relation to stolen weapons. 

Police are still seeking the identities of the other three men who fled the scene.

Anyone who knows the men's whereabouts are urged to call the Liberty County Sheriff's Department at 936-336-4500.
