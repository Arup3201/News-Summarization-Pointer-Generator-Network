Measuring 26 inches by 26 inches and standing proud at 1.5ft tall, this intricately carved and exquisitely detailed World War One battle scene is made entirely out of pastry margarine.

The creation is the brainchild of chef Vipula Athukorale, from Leicester, who won a gold medal for his work at the International Culinary World Cup 2014.

Taking three weeks to complete, the poignant sculpture was made out of a whopping 53lb of the butter substitute.

The 51-year-old's WW1 culinary creation is his second gong.

He won his first gold medal the 2010 International Culinary World Cup, in Luxembourg, in 2010 with a Victorian street scene. 

Mr Athukorale said: 'I wanted to choose a relevant theme to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.

'It is also a tribute to my father Henry who is a retired Lt General in the Sri Lankan army. He was a cadet at Sandhurst in the 1950s.

'The characters show pain, compassion, frustration and anger.'

Mr Athukorale was one of only 14 international competitors  to be awarded the gold standard in his butter sculpture class in Luxembourg.

The Sri Lankan-born chef left school at 18 to train to be a hotel manager but said his real passion is butter sculpting. 

He said: 'I was always better at this; it comes from my love of art at school. I am so pleased to won a gold medal for the British team.' 

The butter artist will be chasing more gold in the Culinary Olympics to be held in Erfurt in Germany in 2016.

'I won two bronze medals there last time in 2012. I aim to do better in two years' time,' he said.
