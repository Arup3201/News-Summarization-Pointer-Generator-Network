An obstetrician who worked at an IVF clinic used by former French president Nicholas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni, is on trial for rape and sexual assault allegations involving his former clients.

Dr Andre Hazout denies rape but has admitted to having sexual intercourse with several of his clients during their fertility treatment after dozens of women came forward.

The gynecologist has also admitted that he may have fathered children with some of the more than 30 women who are accusing him of rape or sexual assault, Paris Criminal Court heard.

Dr Hazout has been called the 'Magician of Babies' due to his high success rate, and practiced at Clinic de la Muette in Paris for more than 20 years.

Both Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who had daughter Giuliana in 2011, and former Justice Minister Rachida Dati have given birth at the IVF clinic, The Times reports.

A total of 33 women have come forward accusing Dr Hazout of rape or sexual assault, but he only stands trial accused of six counts of rape of assault, as the other 27 incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted.

Cecile Poitevin, 56, filed a criminal lawsuit accusing Dr Hazout of sexual assault in 2006. In the wake of the investigation, Dr Hazout's history of sleeping with his clients was unraveled.

Marie Jezequel, 51, was one of 33 women who came forward, saying she was raped and assaulted by Dr Hazout during consultations in the mid-80s.

'He told me that if my husband couldn't get me pregnant, he would. I was 20, I was awestruck. He raped me straight away.

The court heard that she went back to see Dr Hazout twice and 'each time he raped me. I was in his grip because I wanted a baby so much,' Mrs Jezequel said, comparing Dr Hazout to a guru in a sect.

Dr Hazout denies all the allegation and insists that none of the women refused to have intercourse with him.

The trial continues.
