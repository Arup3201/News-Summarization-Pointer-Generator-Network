A man has been warned he could face jail after a stone mantelpiece which weighed the same as a fridge freezer collapsed and killed a six-year-old girl.

The mantelpiece, which was being installed at a family home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, collapsed on top of Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella – in July 2012.

The youngster, who had three brothers – Will, Oli and Archie - died from severe head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace crashed on top of her while she was playing.

Now, Christopher Elmer has been warned he could receive a prison sentence after he admitted a Health and Safety breach in relation to the schoolgirl’s death.

The 39-year-old had been due to stand trial for manslaughter by gross negligence at Reading Crown Court today but the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence.

Court: Christopher Elmer, 39, admitted a Health and Safety breach in relation to the schoolgirl's death when he appeared at Reading Crown Court

It came after Elmer admitted failing to ensure she was not exposed to health and safety risks while he worked at her parents’ five-bedroom home on July 7, 2012.

Prosecutor Iain Wicks said: ‘Following a review of the expert evidence and new reports by the experts, the view was taken that the evidence was insufficient to establish that offence.’

Isabella, who attended the £10,000- a-term Maltman’s School for Girls in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was playing at her home when the tragedy occurred.

She was taken to Wexham Park Hospital in nearby Slough, Berkshire, where she later died as a result of her injuries.

Her parents today attended what should have been the first day of Elmer’s trial and listened in the public gallery as his plea to the Health and Safety breach was accepted.

Judge John Reddihough told Elmer that a pre-sentence report would be prepared prior to his sentencing but warned he could face jail.

He said: ‘I must make it clear to you that all sentencing options remain open to the court, including a custodial sentence.’

Elmer, of Greenford, Middlesex, was released on unconditional bail and will be sentenced on a date yet to be fixed.

Mr and Mrs Pritchard declined to comment after the hearing.

At
 the time of Isabella’s death, headmistress of Maltman’s School for 
Girls, Joanna Pardon, described her as a ‘very special little girl with 
an infectious love of life’.

She said: ‘She will be remembered for her wonderful smile, her laughter and her caring gentle nature.'
