A runner who suffered a gunshot wound in an attack earlier this month may soon see justice.

The New York Post reported that two suspects are being interviewed for their possible involvement.

A female runner was struck by a bullet from a pellet gun, the newspaper reported.

The New York Post said '[P]olice sources said [the two suspects] have been linked to a few other pellet gun shootings around the city.'

Do you recognize us? Several suspects were seen in surveillance video 

The Central Park harassers reportedly included five individuals and the runner was called a 'white b****' by someone, police told the newspaper.

Police also said they '[were] laughing and making anti-white statements.'

Victim Hanna told The New York Daily News last week 'My hand went up to my head, and there was blood gushing everywhere. I turned around, and I said, "What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me? What's wrong with you people?"'

Hanna told the newspaper that a woman said 'F*** you, you f****** white b****' - and also claimed a man said 'All white people suck' and 'F*** white people.'

'It's a hate crime — for no reason at all,' she also said to The New York Daily News last week. 'I was just walking by. There was no sort of eye movement. There was no altercation, confrontation, anything like that.'
