A Towie fan who ran away to Syria with her son and escaped from the clutches of ISIS has told of her terrifying ordeal as she ran a mile through the desert before crossing the border to Turkey.

Tareena Shakil from Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, entered Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her 16-month-old son Zaheem.

But after becoming disillusioned with the fanatical regime, the 25-year-old claims she made a dangerous trip to the Turkish border - clutching Zaheem as she climbed over barbed wire to safety.

Today her father, Mohammed, has spoken of a tearful phone call he received from his daughter during which she described her shock at the 'hell' of living under ISIS - and her bid for freedom.

Shakil, who fled to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in November last year, is now being held by Turkish authorities. It is understood she will be returned to the UK.

Speaking to the Sun, Mohammed, 47, said that his daughter told him how ISIS had lied to her to convince her to go over to Syria. But once there, she was shocked by the full horror of the regime.

She said: 'There were bombs going off everywhere. I never felt safe. I was monitored by chiefs all the time. Women are treated like cattle, herded around and not allowed anywhere without a man.'

Shakil, a former Morrisons worker, said that when ISIS chiefs tried to force her to get married she realised she had to escape with her son.

It was has been previously claimed the young mother fled after being attacked by a would-be suitor.

The 25-year-old previously told a family friend that she broke into a house and stole her passport before tricking a taxi driver into driving her from Raqqa to the Turkish border.

She claims she then ran a mile through harsh desert terrain before climbing over a barbed wire fence - cutting her hands to shreds - as she tried to avoid snipers. 

In November the former Morrisons worker posted this selfie with her son from her home in an ISIS stronghold of the pair of them smiling. She claims she tricked a taxi driver into driver her to the Turkish border

She told her father: 'I thought the guards were going to shoot me there and then. But I didn't care if I lived or died.

'I just held on to Zaheem and thought "I have got to get over the barbed wire". When I got to the other side, I just couldn't believe I was safe'. 

Shakil now wants to make sure others know the truth about ISIS, Mohammed said, to ensure others don't 'fall into their trap'.

After arriving in Raqqa last year, Shakil posted fanatical messages and sent selfies to family in Britain, telling relatives she and her young son would never return.

West Midlands Police confirmed the young mother was being held by Turkish authorities who are working alongside British forces. 

Still considered a missing person and it is understood Shakil will be returned to the UK. 

'We are aware a missing British woman travelling from Syria has been detained by Turkish authorities for immigration matters,' a spokesman for West Midlands Police told MailOnline.

'Police are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure her safe return the UK.' 

Her reported escape from Raqqa comes just two months after she posted a selfie with her son from her home inside the ISIS stronghold. 

A family friend of Shakil told the Sun's Dan Sales: 'The border guards didn't fire for some reason - maybe because she was carrying her son. Her hands were hurt and her feet cut to ribbons climbing the fence.'

Previously her father Mohammed, 42, said she sent him the picture to show they had arrived but she has since cut off all contact.

He has told of how his daughter was a school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with the ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars.

Her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria in October.

Mr Shakil said his daughter did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced.

Shakil is believed to have fled to this refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. She is now being held by authorities and it is understood she will be returned to the UK

He said he believes she was vulnerable after the break-up of her marriage to Zaheem's father Sam - who has flown to Turkey and hopes to bring his son home. 

Around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the ISIS black flag, and calling herself a 'slave to Allah'.

After fleeing, Shakil told her family how she was in Raqqa and could never return to the UK.

In one message she wrote: 'I can't come back there now … we can't. Tell her don't cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!'

And of her journey, she said: 'So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.' 

Mohammed told the Sun he knew his daughter would realise her mistake once she arrived in Syria and said he would now fly to Turkey with her British birth certificate in attempt to have her freed.

Friends say that she wanted to flee from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa because the group were going to force her to marry a jihadi. Her father claims she now wants to reveal the truth about the terror group

Despite posting extremist material online, Shakil is still being considered a person of interest by the authorities and may not face criminal charges. 

Social services have not been involved by British forces with regard to her young son's care.  

'All decisions on returnees from Syria or Iraq are taken on a case-by-case basis,' a spokesman for the Home Office said. 

'Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation. 

'For some, prosecution for terrorist offences is the right course of action. 

'For others, it may be that support from, for example, mental health or social services, is more appropriate.'
