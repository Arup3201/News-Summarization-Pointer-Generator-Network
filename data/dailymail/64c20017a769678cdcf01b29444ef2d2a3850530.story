Neither James Adair nor Ben Stenning had rowed a boat before they drunkenly agreed to row the Indian Ocean.

And these amazing pictures show just how committed the two 32-year-olds were to living up to Ernest Hemingway's famous words: 'Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk.'

After spending their £15,000 life savings on an ocean rowing boat and undertaking just three months of training on the river Thames, the pair not only succeeded in crossing the Indian Ocean, but also in becoming the first ever pair in history to row it without a support boat.

Their heroics and pictures have now been revealed for the first time in the book Rowing after the White Whale, written by James Adair.

Eight years on: James (left) and Ben (right) after succeeding in crossing the Indian Ocean after 116 days at sea. This was taken the night they were dramatically rescued one mile out from the Mauritian coast after a freak wave capsized their boat and dumped them in the sea for five hours as their family waited anxiously onshore

What a team: The pair rowing together about two weeks into the trip judging by the length of their beards

The pair lost about three stone and survived on a diet of freeze-dried food, rationed cigarettes, whisky and a sense of humour. Their fresh water-making machine broke which meant they also had to use a hand pump for two hours a day on top of the 12-hour shifts they each put in on the oars

Strong arms: James at the hand-pump. It took an hour to make a litre of fresh water. And a minute to drink

He said: 'Rowing After the White Whale is an account of our unsupported 
row across the Indian Ocean, a journey which fewer people have completed
than have walked on the moon. We yearned for a big adventure and we 
certainly got what we asked for.

'It's a story of moonbows and meteor showers, passing whales and thieving fish, lurking sharks and giant squid; it is part adventure narrative, part blue water history, part meditation on nature and part memoir.'

Despite warnings that emergency rescue teams could take up to two days to reach them, and against their better judgement, they set off from Perth, Australia in Spring last year.

For the following 116 days their home was a one ton, 26ft, self-righting ocean rowing boat, packed with 300
kilos of dry foods (mainly curry), navigation equipment, a desalinator, some whisky and cigarettes (rationed to one each a day), and their self-imposed limit of three books each.

While one slept in a seven foot by four foot water-tight cabin the other rowed for two hours.

What makes the feat even more impressive is that James, at 14, contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, a debilitating illness which affects the peripheral nervous system and left him in a coma for a month, totally paralysed but conscious. 

Route: The pair managed to cross the Indian Ocean in 116 days despite having no experience prior to their trip

This was taken minutes after they were rescued from the sea. A helicopter had tried and failed to locate them. Fortunately for James and Ben, two locals headed out on their boat to help the search party and spotted them after finding a floating oar from their wrecked boat. Their family waiting onshore had started to fear the worst

His recovery took over a year and left 
him with paralysed feet.

Ben stood on a stonefish while growing up in 
Africa and underwent two years of operations as tropical disease doctors
battled to save his leg.

As the book explains, the adventure 
was something the pair discussed as St Andrews University, with their 
friends dismissing it as nothing but a pipe dream.

After graduating in History (James) 
and English (Ben) the pair lived together in a flat in Brixton, south 
London and soon became unhappy with their respective jobs.

Ben said: 'It stemmed from not being 
happy with what we were doing. We were living in an awful, 
mouse-infested flat, I was a fully integrated accounting software 
salesman and hadn't sold anything in the six months I had been there. 
James was doing a law course he wasn't really interested in.

'An article about Jim Shekhdar, the first person to complete a solo 
unassisted non-stop crossing of the Pacific Ocean, had just come out and
over red wine on a wintery Sunday evening, just as the pay-as-you-go 
electricity was about to run out, we decided to give it a go."

Both
men contributed £400 a month to their boat fund, which they used to buy
a £15,000 craft that has twice crossed the Atlantic with previous 
owners.

But he journey was far from plain sailing, or rather rowing.

Just after the halfway mark a giant wave smashed down on the boat just as James was stepping out of the cabin, breaking the onboard navigation system (GPS) and desalinator system.

'We were forced to use a handheld GPS which just gave co-ordinates but nothing else (unlike the proper GPS which showed speed and course which you can use to plot you way.

'But dwindling batteries meant we only switched handheld on now and then and just used the compass to navigate.'

Tweets made by the pair during the journey. Humour was something they relied on to keep spirits high.

Often they would row all day only to find that the current had actually pushed them back.

On their last day, just as they caught sight of land for the first time in 116 days and their family and friends arrived to greet them, another huge wave, this time only bigger, capsized their boat and threw them both overboard.

Ben managed to rescue a flare from the boat, which he let off, only for the flare's cap to backfire in to James' leg.

With blood streaming into the depths of the shark-infested water, the pair clung together for five hours until a local rescue team miraculously found them and brought them to dry land and into the arms of their parents who had all but given up hope of find them alive.

Rowing After the White Whale: A Crossing of the Indian Ocean by Hand, published by Birlinn, is now on sale priced £12.99.

Reunited: James with wife Tory who had flown out to greet him. She brought with her Boost chocolate bars, something he had craved while at sea. Prior to setting off she had given him a packet of letters for the journey. He was instructed to open one every two weeks - something that kept him going when things got tough

Ben and James with the men and their sons who decided to join the search party and who carried on looking for them even when the helicopter turned back. They found them after five hours bobbing in the sea - and are pictured here with the capsized boat's oars.

Having recuperated and feasted on the food and drink they had dreamed about while out at sea, the pair pose by the boat from which they had become separated right at the very end of their epic 3,100nautical mile journey
