A furious husband has told how he only discovered his wife had been put on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway when he overheard staff talking about her. 

Josephine Dunn, 73, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham on March 30 with a urinary tract infection.

Her husband Stuart, 68, rushed to the hospital to be with his wife but claims he was told by doctors that she had 'no chance' of surviving.

Angry: Stuart Dunn is furious after doctors put his wife Josephine on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway without his knowledge

Mrs Dunn, here on her wedding day in 1972, suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with a urinary tract infection but went downhill fast

Mrs Dunn came around later that day - but her husband only became aware she had been put on the end-of-life plan when he overheard a doctor talking to a nurse.

Despite doctors ruling she qualified for the Liverpool Care Pathway, Mrs Dunn, a retired cleaner, was discharged from hospital on April 2.

She was taken back to Peacemills Care Home in Nottingham and where she is recovering.

The NHS Trust responsible for the hospital has apologised for a 'breakdown in communication' with Mr Dunn.

But today the retired WHSmith worker slammed the hospital for leaving his wife-of-40 years 'to die'.

Mr Dunn, from Nottingham, fumed: 'I got a call saying you had better get to the hospital. She was in a holding bay off A&E and then she was put in a side ward. 

'The doctor came to me and said no chance at all that she is going to pull through.

'She came around Saturday lunchtime and I gave her some water and some yoghurt. I never saw another doctor until the Sunday.

'On Sunday I just happened to hear a doctor saying to a nurse "I'll have to take her off the Pathway".

When he asked a nurse to clarify the situation, she said: 'Yes, I thought you knew.'

Mr Dunn (right) said he only became aware his wife had been put on the end-of-life plan when he overheard a doctor talking to a nurse about it

Mr Dunn said: 'An apology isn't good enough. I first overheard Josephine was on the pathway from hearing doctors and nurses talking.

'I wouldn't have known had I not heard them gossiping. No one told me directly. I was angry because I know what the Liverpool Care Pathway is.'

The pathway gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or 
medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as 
comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should 
still be given.

It was initially developed for the care of dying cancer patients. But last year the NHS was accused of using it as a way of prematurely ending elderly people's lives.

Recovering: Seven days since she left hospital, Mrs Dunn is 'happy' and back at her care home

Mr Dunn said: 'As soon as I realised what was going on, I asked for her to be taken off it and the mood immediately changed. 

'If she had died Saturday morning, I wouldn't have known she was on Pathway. I had to tell my daughter and she had to bring the grandkids up to say goodbye to her.

'In my mind, once you reach that certain age, they don't seem to care, you're just a number. To me, it's wrong, they just decided that's it, she has no chance.'

Mrs Dunn started developing dementia ten years ago and five years ago moved to a care home when her round-the-clock care needs became too much for her husband to cope with on his own.

Mrs Dunn, who has one daughter Cara, 33, and two grandchildren, is recovering at the care home.

Mr Dunn said: 'I don't want people to go through what I had to, they should at least be informed.

'I suppose it's a good thing if you're terminally ill but not when they give someone no chance to recover when they can.

'Seven days since she left hospital, she is sat in the care home and is happy.

'An apology doesn't make things right - they left her to die.'

Dr Stephen Fowlie, Medical Director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We have apologised to Mr Dunn for the breakdown in communication in his wife's care.

'The Liverpool Care Pathway is used at NUH as established best practice for guiding the treatment of patients at the end of their life.

'However this decision should not have been enacted without discussion with Mr Dunn, who arrived at the hospital a short time after his wife.'

The idea behind the Liverpool Care Pathway is to allow people with a terminal illness to die with dignity regardless of whether they are at home, in hospital or in a hospice.

It was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute.

It gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should still be given.

It is now recommended by the Department of Health as a model of best practice and has been adopted by most hospitals.

It was introduced because during the 1990s there was increasing consensus that standards of end-of-life care were patchy and that some hospices were providing excellent care while others were not.

Particular concern was expressed about patients being subjected to invasive treatment that offered no chance of preventing death and of people being put through unnecessary suffering by needlessly prolonging life.

It has been controversial as some families have claimed that their loved ones have been put on the pathway without their consent and that it has resulted in them dying earlier than they would otherwise have done.
