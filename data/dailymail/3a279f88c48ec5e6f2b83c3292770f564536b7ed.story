Strasbourg was in retreat last night over its instruction to Britain to give prisoners the vote as Tories threatened to walk away from the institution.

The Council of Europe expressed ‘profound concern and disappointment’ that ministers had ignored its repeated demands to allow convicts to take part in elections.

But instead of threatening the UK with legal action, the council booted the issue into the long grass until September 2015 – after Britain’s general election.

John Hirst, who served 25 years in jail for murdering his landlady with an axe, says Britain is wrongly denying prisoners a vote in May's general election

MPs said Strasbourg had been spooked by Tory threats to leave the court’s jurisdiction if it continued to ride roughshod over the will of Parliament

They believe the Committee of Ministers, which oversees the court and is in charge of ensuring its verdicts are upheld, is quietly backing down because it does not want to inflame the row further.

Tory Dominic Raab said: ‘This just shows Britain can defend its democratic rights in the face of the arbitrary meddling of the Strasbourg court without facing fines, compensation awards or anything more than the mildest diplomatic ruffling of feathers.’

British ministers have repeatedly expressed their anger at the court’s decision in 2005 to give inmates the vote.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling have both made it clear that if the court does not change, the UK must be ready to leave.

Tory proposals to reassert the sovereignty of Parliament over the court will be included in the party’s election manifesto. These are likely to be backed by a formal threat to quit.

Since ministers began talking tough, Strasbourg’s stance has changed markedly. Last month, the court lifted the threat of a multi-million-pound compensation bandwagon for inmates who have been waiting to vote.

It held to its condemnation of the centuries-old British practice, despite the dissenting opinion of two of the judges, who said that the court’s thinking was a mess and that there was nothing wrong with the law in Britain.

The prisoner who won the original Euro court ruling was John Hirst, who killed his landlady with an axe in Burghfield, Berkshire, in 1979. Hirst, who served 25 years behind bars, has continued his campaign despite being freed in 2004. But the judges said there would be no compensation payment for any of the ten Scottish prisoners who lodged test cases.

They said the satisfaction of knowing the court had upheld their complaint was enough.

Tory MPs are likely to point to the change in Strasbourg’s position as evidence of what can be achieved if a European institution takes Britain’s threat to leave seriously. David Cameron is under pressure to make a similar commitment that, if he cannot secure significant reform from Brussels, he is prepared to campaign for a so-called Brexit – or British exit.

However, in a sign of mounting tensions within the party, William Hague last night warned fellow Tories to stop saying they would vote to leave the EU.

The former party leader urged colleagues not to get ‘distracted’ by banging the drum for leaving but simply concentrate on promising voters a referendum.

Mr Cameron has promised an in-out vote on Britain’s membership in 2017 if the Tories win the general election in May.

Labour and the Lib Dems do not support a referendum.

The Prime Minister has said that if his party wins, he will spend two years negotiating with other European countries to get a better deal for Britain and would then campaign to stay in the EU.

But several Tory backbenchers plan to tell constituents they will vote to leave Europe. MP Mark Reckless said this month: ‘My election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the EU.’
