As Arsenal's players gear up for this weekend's Emirates Cup, Mesut Ozil is still relaxing on holiday with his girlfriend.

The 25-year-old was spotted with Mandy Capristo relaxing by the pool of their hotel in Las Vegas.

Winning the World Cup with Germany was the perfect end to a mixed season for the former Real Madrid man, but Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says Ozil will miss the start of the season after his summer exploits.

The Frenchman said: 'I have given them (Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker) a good break because I have experience of players who have been in the World Cup final. You need a rest.

'Will they be ready? Mertesacker prepares well - but for the first game I don't think they will be ready for August 16.'

Arsenal travelled to the US for a pre-season friendly against Thierry Henry's New York Red Bull's last week but lost 1-0.

Arsene Wenger will be hoping that his side can do a little better in their annual pre-season tournament in north London. They face Benfica on Saturday afternoon and Monaco the following day.

Goal: Mesut Ozil scores against Algeria in the first knockout round of the tournament, it was his only goal

Friends: Rumours had been circulating that Sami Khedira was poised to join Ozil at Arsenal but it's gone quiet
