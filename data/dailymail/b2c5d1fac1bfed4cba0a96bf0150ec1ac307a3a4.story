With one hand on the wheel he leans to one of the country's most controversial comedians and asks 'What's the meaning of life Frankie?'

This is the self styled 'Artist Taxi Driver' Mark McGowan and he is interviewing Frankie Boyle - a man perhaps better known for his tasteless jokes about the Queen and glamour model Jordan's disabled son than his spiritual views.

Controversial 'performance artist' Mr McGowan - who once performed a 'piece' in which he keyed a succession of cars, ate a dead corgi, and danced a ballet dance while dressed as a pig outside New Scotland Yard -  has attracted a cult following on his own YouTube channel with some videos attracting more than 200,000 hits.

Controversial 'performance artist' Mark McGowan has become a YouTube sensation after reinventing himself as the Artist Taxi Driver

His YouTube channel is filled iwth nearly 2,000 videos in which he can be seen ranting to the camera and interviewing controversial figures such as comedian Frankie Boyle

In them he can be seen interviewing high profile figures such as Boyle, Respect MP George Galloway, and the Oxford Cambridge boat race saboteur Trenton Oldfield, who happily tells the artist that the six months he spent in prison for his stunt were 'an amazing experience'.

In the bizarre interview with Boyle, in which the comedian tells him that he believes the universe is 'conscious' and that creation is God just playing a 'game of hide and seek with himself', the taxi driver can be heard calling the  Queen a 'hairy f*****'.

He said: 'Whats with the f****** queen? what's her gig? She's a hairy goat legged f*****'

'She's feeding off our pain.'

The taxi driver also hears from Oxford Cambridge boat race saboteur Trenton Oldfield, who happily tells the artist that the six months he spent in prison for his stunt were 'an amazing experience'

His past stunts have seen him eat dead corgi meat in protest at the Royal treatment of animals

He also performed a ballet piece while dressed as a pig outside New Scotland Yard

He also crawled for seven miles - while pushing a toy pig - all the way to the doors of Number 10 to protest at NHS reforms

Other videos uploaded to the channel chunkymark see Mr McGowan - who is also said to be a teacher at Chelsea College of Art and Design - swearing and ranting directly into a camera about issues such as the Woolwich murder, the Syrian conflicts, NHS reforms and the London riots, all of which he takes a decidedly left wing view on. 

Almost 30,000 people subscribe to his YouTube channel, while many thousands of his Facebook fans have called for him to be Prime Minister.

He claims the Government is 'pulling 
off a huge scam' and a 'massive robbery' by moving 'public money into 
private pockets', The Independent reports.

Mr McGowan first rose to fame in 2005 with two public works which attracted public attention - and some anger.

The first, ‘the running tap’, saw him leave a tap running in the kitchen of a London gallery, to protest against water company Thames Water, and the second was the keying of cars, which he claimed was part of a creative process.

At the time Mr McGowan said: 'I  do feel guilty about keying people's cars but if I don't do it, someone else will.

'They should feel glad that they've been involved.'

He also pushed a pig to the doors of Number 10 on his hands and knees in protest at NHS reforms, pulled a bus with his big toe and ate a corgi to protest at the Royal treatment of animals.

On the NHS: 'To David Cameron and his
 government, just so you know we think you are an evil, despicable 
person without a mandate hiding in shadows.

'You produce health policy 
that is abhorrent to profit from people who are sick and vulnerable is 
inexcusable. The primary purpose of your 
government is to move public money into private pockets as fast as is 
humanly possible. You are like pigs at the trough.'
    
On Gaza: 'Gaza is a massacre. It is murder what the Israeli government 
is doing now to the people of Gaza. It is absolutely out f******- 
rageous mate, and the West, the West is not only complicit in the 
massacre of Gaza in the genocide of the f****** Palestinian people, it 
is not only complicit, it condones it.'

On the Queen: 'Whats with the f****** Queen what's her gig? She's a hairy goat legged f*****. She's feeding off our pain.'

On Prince George: 'There are 50 armed guards . F****** 50 armed guards protecting Prince George. You what?
'Why they got a ring of steel around the baby, who knows, looks like some form of protection against who? against what?'
