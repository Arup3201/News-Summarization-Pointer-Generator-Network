More than four fifths of American teenagers are at risk from heart disease thanks to their unhealthy diets, a study has revealed.

While young people may not believe that their current lifestyle will have a long-term impact on their health, researchers say that there is a strong link between childhood behaviour and the long-term outlook for people's hearts.

And more than 80 per cent are classified as having 'poor' diets, with just one in hundred eating the recommended level of healthy foods.

The study by the American Heart Association was aimed at identifying young people who might be in danger of developing heart problems.

It tested 4,673 Americans between the ages of 12 and 19 for their blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, blood glucose, diet, exercise levels and smoking habits.

Healthy diet proved by far the most worrying category, with the vast majority of subjects eating a poor mix of food groups.

Scientists recommend eating at least 4.5 cups of fruit of vegetable a day, as well at 3oz of whole grain and no more than 1,500mg.

Across the course of a week, young people should have at least two servings of fish and no more than 450 calories of sugary drinks - but only one per cent manage to fulfil all those conditions.

Danger: The vast majority of teenagers prefer fast food to healthy snacks

Christina Shay, a researcher at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center who is lead author of the AHA study, described the findings on diet as 'far less than optimal'.

She added that the U.S.'s youth obesity epidemic is 'influencing worsening rates of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and blood glucose at these young ages'.

The situation is less dire when it comes to teenagers' exercise, but it is still worrying as just 67 per cent of boys and 44 per cent of girls engage in recommended levels of physical activity.

And the toll of unhealthy lifestyles is already showing on adolescents, as a third have cholesterol levels rated as intermediate or poor.

Overall, fewer than half of those in the study reached acceptable levels in at least five of the seven risk factors.

Although nearly all children are born with hearts which are perfectly healthy, it can take just a few years for an unhealthy lifestyle to manifest itself in the body.

The researchers write in the study, published in the journal Circulation, that autopsies conducted on children as young as six have for decades shown 'fatty streaks in the large arteries' as a result of poor diet.

'The status of heart health during childhood has been shown to be a strong predictor of heart health in adulthood,' Dr Shay concluded.

'Members of the medical and scientific community, parents, teachers and legislators all need to focus their efforts on the prevention and improvement of all aspects of cardiovascular health - particularly optimal physical activity levels and diet - as early in life as possible, beginning at birth.'
