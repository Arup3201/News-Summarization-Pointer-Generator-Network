Manchester City youngster Albert Rusnak is at the centre of a three-way transfer battle ahead of next month's transfer window.

PAOK, Heerenveen and Groningen are all interested in signing the talented Slovakian in January and have contacted City about potential moves.

Rusnak is set to bid a fond farewell to the Etihad Stadium on a permanent basis next month.

Albert Rusnak (on loan at SC Cambuur) is at the centre of a three-way transfer battle ahead of next month

The Slovakian is highly thought of but Manchester City's big spending meant he couldn't break into the team

The 20-year-old is currently on loan with Dutch club SC Cambuur, where he has impressed scoring four goals in 16 appearances, which has led to him being described as the 'Pearl of the Eredivisie' by Dutch press.

And his displays have caught the attention of a number of clubs across Europe.

Having joined City as a 16-year-old, Rusnak has strong emotional ties with the Etihad Stadium club.

But the attacking midfielder wants to continue his football education elsewhere.

His current loan deal expires on January 1, but City are open to allowing the youngster to leave on a permanent deal in January.

Rusnak is highly-rated by City coaches following his arrival from FC Kosice as a teenage prodigy.

But the club's big spending era ultimately meant the talented Slovakian could not break into the senior set-up.

And Rusnak is optimistic a permanent switch away next month can catapult him into the senior Slovakia set-up.
