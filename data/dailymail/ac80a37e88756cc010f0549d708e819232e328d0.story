Three men found dead in a BMW parked near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan were known for robbing drug dealers and their murders may have been a retaliation, police said.

Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto Suazo, 26, and Luis Catalan, 25, were shot in the skull execution-style by a gunman police believe was sitting inside the car during the shootings at the Morningside Heights neighbourhood.

The men, discovered on Thursday evening near the Ivy League college, all had lengthy criminal records as they switched between robbing drug dealers or getting robbed by them.

The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church, DNAInfo reported.

Authorities said they believe a gunman used a revolver to shoot the victims because no shell casings were found.

Police said they believe the gunman first killed Catalan, sitting on the right, back seat, by shooting him in the left temple and side, the New York Post reported.

Then driver Rodriguez died next followed by Suazo, who was sitting in the front passenger seat as they were both shot behind the ears.

Sources said that the shooter was likely sitting behind the driver when he unloaded his rounds.

Police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered.

The high-end vehicle had temporary registration stickers and appeared to be stolen, according to the New York Daily News.

Catalan had been arrested at least 10 times for charges ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license, the Daily News reported.

Suazo was arrested late last year for having 12 pounds of marijuana and loaded guns. Rodriguez served two years in state prison for gun charges, according to the Daily News.

No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire.

'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.’

'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.'

One source told the Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene.

'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may 
have used a silencer,' said a police source.

And 'he may have plugged 
his ears.'

Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall.

Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide after the bodies were found.

‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman.

Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime

The police were alerted around 6.30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead.

Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia.

NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told reporters that authorities will go through surveillance video in hopes of putting the pieces together.

Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident.

The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.
