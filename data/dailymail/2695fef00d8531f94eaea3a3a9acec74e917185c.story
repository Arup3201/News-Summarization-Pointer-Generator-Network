Older homeowners with interest-only mortgages could be told by their banks to take out a lifetime loan or move out of their property.

People in their 50s and 60s who cannot pay off their debt at the end of a typical 25-year interest-only mortgage may be offered a loan which they will take to their grave, to avoid repossession.

Major banks are expected to offer a deal which will allow them to stay in their home and pay back only the interest, if they agree to give their house to the lender, rather than family, after their death.

Spanish bank Santander will reportedly offer 'lifetime mortgages' to customers from next year in a bid to tackle the number of older homeowners who will never afford to repay their home loan

The property would then be sold and most of the proceeds would go to the lender. Spanish bank Santander will reportedly offer ‘lifetime mortgages’ to customers from next year in a bid to tackle the number of older homeowners who will never afford to repay their home loan.

Industry experts said other banks were also looking at the option in a bid to tackle a mortgage ‘time bomb’ for older borrowers.

Interest-only deals have lower monthly repayments because the customer is paying off only the interest, but they must then repay the full amount at the end of the fixed term. However, figures show that around half of the 130,000 interest-only mortgages which expire each year cannot be paid off in full by the homeowner.

The average shortfall is around £71,000, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority.

Many lenders are reluctant to lend to the over 60s, making it hard to get a new loan when their fixed term ends

After the homeowner died, the property would be sold and most of the proceeds would go to the lender

Around 2.8million people in the UK have interest-only mortgages but banks estimate that as many as five per cent of customers are completely unaware they are on that type of payment plan.

Steve Pateman, head of UK banking at Santander, told the Financial Times: ‘We have got to find a way to help people and we can’t just put them in a sausage machine and process them so they are out of their houses in six months.’

Ros Altmann, the government’s business champion for older workers, welcomed the news, saying: ‘If you have an interest-only mortgage it effectively means the bank owns your home.

‘You don’t – that’s the reality. Lenders are trying to keep people in their homes rather than repossess them, and these new deals will ensure the bank still owns most of the house when they die.’

A lifetime mortgage is a long-term loan secured against your home which is repaid when you die.

But experts warned that the loans should be considered only as a ‘last resort’ in the event that borrowers are unable to downsize to release the cash or secure a new mortgage.

Many lenders are reluctant to lend to the over 60s, making it difficult for them to get a new loan when their fixed term ends.

Steve Lowe, of financial services firm Just Retirement, told the Telegraph: ‘It would be unacceptable for borrowers to default to a lifetime mortgage as these type of loans require specialist advice, with families sitting down to discuss the consequences over many months before signing on the dotted line.’

 

There are plenty of mortgage options out there for those wanting to buy a house - Santander's new offer is just one example.

In general, longer-term mortgages are becoming more popular as prospective buyers struggle to keep up with rising prices.    

And getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of available options, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.

There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. 

Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way
