An American entrepreneur has created a solution to waiting in airport queues with nowhere other than a dirty floor to sit on or a grubby wall to lean against.

Chicago-based Brian Gibson has designed a gadget for luggage that allows travellers to pull out the handles of their roll-on suitcases and convert them into chairs. 

Mr Gibson is hoping to raise funds on Kickstarter for the bags to be manufactured, and if his goal amount of $120,400 (£74,000) is met then the suitcases could in shops by April next year.

Ingeniously simple solution: Brian Gibson's neXstep luggage has a handle which converts into a chair 

Mr Gibson is hoping to raise $120,400 (£74,000) on Kickstarter for the bags to be manufactured. The money raised will fund production of the bags as well as marketing and promotion efforts

According to their Kickstarter page. the neXstep Luggage System prototype bags have successfully been checked in onto aircraft on several occasions without incident. 

Mr Gibson also writes  that the design has not been denied approval by the Federal Aviation Authority in the US. 

NeXstep - which Mr Gibson developed in 2009 - can also be used as a suitcase rack when packing or unpacking luggage.

The bags will be made from carbon fiber, polycarbonate, ballistic nylon, Cordura, Kevlar and aircraft grade aluminum and will look very similar to the designs on the Kickstarter page. 

The check-in bag is priced at $324.99 (£202) and the carry-on luggage is $224.99 (£140). 

'Much-needed product': The bag has received positive comments from luggage retailers

'The materials used will be of highest quality parts and have the look and feel of any high quality brand on the market today,' Mr Gibson states.

'Our manufacturer has built luggage for some of the world's most recognized brands and adhere to the highest quality standards.'

The money raised on Kickstarter will fund production of the bags as well as marketing and promotion efforts.

Mr Gibson has partnered with two successful consumer products executives, Thomas R Sandler who is the former CEO Americas of Samsonite, and Chris Gantz, the former CEO of Japan Electronic to realise his vision.

Luggage retailers posted positive comments about the product on Kickstarter,

Nashville Trunk and Bag wrote: 'Looks like a much-needed product in our industry. I would consider purchasing for my store.

'The safe guard against insects would be a huge selling point and we could see stocking the product for this reason.

'The benefits of this product hit the mark. The fact you can live out of the luggage and people do not put clothes in a hotel drawer which potentially contain bed bugs is a huge benefit,' Specialty Luggage commented.
