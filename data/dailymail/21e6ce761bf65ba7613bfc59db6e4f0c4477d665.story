Britons are running up debt at the fastest rate in seven years, after £1.25billion was borrowed on credit cards, loans and overdrafts in November.

The Bank of England figures showed that November saw the biggest rise in unsecured borrowing since February 2008, when Northern Rock was nationalised and the credit crunch took hold.

It comes as consumer helplines warn that people would be struggling to make ends meet when the first credit card bills of the year start to arrive this month.

Experts say Black Friday promotions were probably linked to a new seven-year high in borrowing for UK consumers during November 

Statistics released yesterday show that more than £980m was taken out in loans and overdrafts during November, a sharp rise from the average of £728m in the six months before.

The report also shows that, despite credit card lending falling from £399m in October to £269m, it remained above the average for the previous six months.  

Experts said the surge in retail sales around Black Friday - when an estimated £810m was spent online - was probably linked to the increase in borrowing. 

Research carried out by R3, which represents those working in the insolvency sector, found that more than a quarter of adults were expecting to take on debt to pay for their celebrations. 

At the same time, banks and credit card companies were competing with offers in a bid to win new customers and balance transfer deals on credit cards became increasingly generous.

Martin Beck at the EY Item Club told the Independent that growth rate was 'reminiscent of the credit-fuelled days of the mid-2000s'.   

And Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, told the Guardian that many households will probably be overstretched.

She said: 'While most people will be able to cope with this extra borrowing, we are concerned that many households will have overstretched – particularly over the Christmas period.' 

Chief executive of the debt charity StepChange Mike O'Connor added that the figures 'point to a worrying rise in people's reliance on credit'.

According to the figures, unsecured lending was up 6.9 per cent in November, compared with the previous year. It had grown at its most rapid pace since October 2005.

The statistics also showed that consumers have borrowed more than they have paid off almost every month since September 2012.  

On the business lending side there was a more encouraging picture, with net lending to small and medium-sized businesses rising by £252m in November. 

It represented the biggest increase since the series was started by the Bank of England in 2011.

But net lending to all non-financial businesses fell again by £1.1bn, while the figures showed a slowdown in mortgage lending.

According to the R3 research carried out before Christmas, half of those planning to borrow money for the festive period were planning to use an existing credit card, while 24 per cent said they would use overdrafts. Some 14 per cent said they would borrow on a store card.

Worryingly, 11 per cent planned to skip other spending commitments, like mortgage payments, while eight per cent expected to need a payday loan.  

Giles Frampton said: 'Taking on debts is fine so long as they’re affordable and people have a plan for how to pay the debt back. Pressure to spend is acute at Christmas.'
