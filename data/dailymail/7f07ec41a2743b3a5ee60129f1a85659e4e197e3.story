Many people feel more comfortable revealing their true feelings, hopes and stresses to a partner after sex and now one researcher thinks she knows why.

Amanda Denes believes pillow talk is an undervalued ingredient in a satisfying and enduring relationship and is linked to the production of the 'trust hormone' called oxytocin, which is released after orgasm.

She found that women who 
orgasmed disclosed more intimate feelings to their partner after sex than women who did not orgasm, which increased the emotional bond between couples.

Amanda Denes believes post-sex pillow talk can influence relationship satisfaction just as much as other factors, such as the frequency and satisfaction of sex itself

The Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Connecticut, became interested in investigating the role of pillow talk in relationships as people have such different experiences of it.

Many people said they open up about their feelings to a partner after sex regardless of the length of a relationship – a time period described as the post-coital time interval (PCTI) by researchers Daniel Kruger and Susan Hughes.

‘Why were some people sharing their innermost feelings, even when they knew the relationship had not yet reached that level? What effects would these post-coital disclosures have on relationship satisfaction?’ Professor Denes wrote in an article for the university.

To explore the relationship between hormones and communication decisions, she looked at what people talked about during PCTI as well as ‘one important variable [that] was likely influencing this whole process – orgasm.’

‘To ignore the importance of orgasm would be to ignore a key piece of the pillow-talk puzzle ,’ she said.

When individuals experience orgasm, physiological changes occur as a hormone called oxytocin floods their bodies.

Increases in this ‘trust hormone’ have been linked to many socially beneficial behaviours.

Professor Denes believes that oxytocin is the reason why, as women who climax have more of the hormone in their systems, which increases feelings of trust and connection, than women who did not, influencing individuals’ decisions to talk about their feelings to their partners.

She explained that women may talk more about their feelings after sex than men as men’s higher levels of testosterone suppresses the oxytocin response.

Individuals in a committed relationship perhaps unsurprisingly disclosed more intimate feelings to their partners after sex than those in newer or more short-term relationships, Professor Denes said.

A previous study found that the afterglow of an orgasm minimises the risks and increases the benefits of disclosing personal information.

Scientists have found that women whose partners finish off a night of passion by immediately turning over and nodding off are left feeling insecure and craving affection.

Psychologists at the University of Michigan said cuddling and talking after sex is a crucial way for a couple to express their commitment to each other, in a study published last January.

In relationship terms, they said it could be just as important as what happens before sex, or even the act itself.

They questioned 456 heterosexual people who completed online surveys about their sleep patterns with their partner.

Lead author Dr Daniel Kruger said they found the participants’ desire for emotional bonding, affection and communication was greatest when their partner fell asleep first.

This was found in both men and women but a wealth of previous studies have shown men invariably fall asleep first.

Dr Kruger said: ‘When their partner feel asleep first, they craved that bonding time, for expressions of affection and endearment and felt it was lacking.

‘A woman could be pregnant. Although with contraception that may not be the case anymore, we still have this psychology, and the post-coital time is when the couple makes promises to each other and establish commitment.

‘The time couples spend together after sex might be as important as what happens before it in terms of building the relationship yet it has rarely been studied.’
