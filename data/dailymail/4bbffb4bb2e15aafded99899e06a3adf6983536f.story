An undersea earthquake off the East Cape of New Zealand, measuring 6.5, has been widely felt around the North Island.

Damage was reported at Ohope, in the eastern Bay of Plenty, when the quake struck about 150 kilometres off the coast about 10.37am local time on Monday.

The Pacific tsunami warning centre said based on the data, there is no tsunami threat from the earthquake but threat will continue to be monitored as aftershocks continue.

GeoNet said the severe quake was about 31 kilometres underground and has received more than 1600 reports of the quake some being felt from as far away as Whangarei in the Far North to one person down in Dunedin.

Geonet Siesmologist Bill Fry said the depth of the quake was below interface and since the 6.5 magnitude shock there has been quite a few aftershocks.

'There was a magnitude 4 quake that happened about 30 to 40 minutes after the 6.5 shake,' he said.

'We are still getting aftershocks but the typical sequence is that it has slowed down, the frequency has slowed down.'

'Now watching and monitoring aftershocks to see if anything further will happen,' said Mr Fry.

He said the 6.5 quake was less than 2 per cent force of gravity, with very small exceleration.

Mr Fry said there was no tsunami threat but that would have happened quite quickly from the time the earthquake struck, taking only about 15 minutes for it to take effect.

'The area has been prone to earthquakes in the past and the biggest dangers is assessing whether a tsunami will follow a shock.'

'In 1947 an earthquake caused a tsunami, it moved very slowly and there was a very large tsunami, so any time we have an earthquake we immediately need assess the potential for a tsunami,' he said. 

Twenty-two people reported it as moderate with just one person at Ohope reporting damage.

'It was just really a long rolling one and then quite a strong jolt, and it carried on rolling and that was it,' said Ohope Beach Primary School's Jenny McKenzie.

However, she did not think it was bad enough to cause any damage, she told NZ Newswire.

The earthquake on Monday morning in New Zealand also hit social media quickly

Liz Koia told stuff.co.nz, the shelves rocked and lights swung inside the Eastern Four Square at Te Araroa.

'It just kept rolling. The shelves were rocking, the fluorescent lights that hang down were swinging from side to side,' she said.

A staff member at East Cape Manuka Company told Daily Mail Australia they did hear it in the cafe and at first it was just shock.

'Customers got up and ran under the door,' she said, 'but nothing fell off the shelves, nothing was broken we just got a bit of a fright.'

'There was a tsunami warning from the local school which evacuated, as well as businesses but we have all just come back to work and the panic is over.'

'It was a big one, haven't been any like this except the odd little shake.'
