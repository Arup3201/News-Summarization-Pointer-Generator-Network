A retired New York City detective has used forensic techniques to help solve one of the art world's longest running cold cases over a disputed Jackson Pollock painting.

For 57 years the artist's mistress, Ruth Kligman, has claimed he created Red, Black & Silver as a love token for her one month before he was killed in a car crash.

And now, thanks to the discovery of fur from a polar bear skin rug and hair from the artist, forensics expert Nicholas Petraco has authenticated her story.

Proof: Abstract artist Jackson Pollock pictured with mistress Ruth Kligman before his death in 1956. For 57 years she said that the Red, Black & Silver painting was created for her. Now her claim has been verified with traces of fur from a polar bear skin rug

According to Miss Kligman, who was 26 when she began her affair with Pollock, she watched as the artist famed for his drip paintings created the 2ft by 2ft abstract picture after she asked him 'to show me how you make a painting'.

After her death in 2010, the trustees of her estate turned to retired detective Mr Petraco, who has used CSI techniques to uncover indisputable clues.

Traces of fur from a polar bear skin rug in Pollock's East Hampton home, a hair from the artist and sand unique to his neighborhood have all been found in the painting.

'There’s a f***ing polar-bear hair 
in the painting ... It’s Dick Tracy,' artist Jonathan Cramer, one
of the estate’s co-trustees, told the New York Post.

'The
world was flat. Now it is round. It’s Galileo. Science can now be used 
to authenticate the art ... We are [tracing] the painting back to 
where it was executed. It’s very CSI.'

The discovery marks the first time crime scene analysis has been used to prove a painting's authenticity by looking for fragments found in it, rather than just on the paint.

If Detective Petraco's findings are accepted by the trustees board, it would be a windfall for Miss Kligman's estate. A similar-size Pollock painting sold for $58.3 million at Sotheby’s in May last year.

Art investigators use a variety of forensic techniques to determine if a work is genuine. 

Fingerprints on the canvas, analysis of brush strokes and signatures and even carbon dating on the canvas and pigments can all be used to prove if a work is the real deal. 

These small tell-tale signs can bring multi-million dollar windfalls to collectors.

In one case, a trucker who bought a painting for $5 at a California thrift store in 1992 was offered $5 million for it after analysis matched a fingerprint on the canvas to prints on a can used by Pollock and another of his paintings. 

Despite the forensic analysis in that case, the work was not certified by the art world, but it was still deemed valuable by collectors.

In the case of Red, Black & Silver, detective Petraco was able to find traces of Pollock's hair, sand from the East Hamptons and fur from a polar bear skin rug kept in the artist's home.

Miss Kligman, described as having the looks of a silver screen siren, had tried to have the painting acknowledged as Pollock's last work since he presented it to her, saying: 'Here’s your painting, your very own Pollock.'

The couple met in the Cedar Tavern in Greenwich when Miss Kligman was working for a gallery and Pollock, 44, was drinking heavily, according to Vanity Fair.

In her 1974 memoir, Love Affair: A Memoir of Jackson Pollock, Miss Kligman recalled watching as Pollock created Red, Black & Silver on the lawn of his East Hampton home one July afternoon.

'I watched dazzled as you created it. How incredible, miraculous you were that afternoon in the sun,' she wrote.

The result was: 'The final painting of your life, your legacy to me, silver shimmering substance of the cosmos, the red heart oval shape of love, and the black form grounds the field.'

One month later Miss Kligman was the sole survivor of the car crash that killed Pollock and another woman after he drunkenly lost control of his car.

With Pollock's widow, Lee Krasner, on the authenticating board however, the mistress had no chance of proving the painting given to her as a love letter was real.

Dispute: Pollock with his wife Lee Krasner in 1949. She was on the authenticating board for his work after the artist died in a car crash

Kligman, an abstract painter and muse to many artists, died in 2010. As well as Red, Black & Silver, her estate included more than 700 artworks and letters from lovers and friends, including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Andy Warhol.

She had no beneficiaries so the future of the painting is unclear.
