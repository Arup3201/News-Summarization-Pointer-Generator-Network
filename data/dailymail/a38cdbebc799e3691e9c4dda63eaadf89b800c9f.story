For some people a song, a smell or a certain place can evoke nostalgia and stir up strong memories from the past. For Lorelei Vashti, it's her dresses that hold the key.

In her new book Dress, Memory: A Memoir Of My Twenties In Dresses, Ms Vashti explores the tumultuous decade of her life through her relationship with special items of clothing.

'A big part of the book and writing it was trying to understand why I had this relationship with clothing', she told Daily Mail Australia.

In her new book Dress, Memory: A Memoir Of My Twenties In Dresses by Lorelei Vashti explores her emotional relationship with her clothes with this dress representing her 24th year

The book chronicles Ms Vashti's life through her twenties as she makes the link between important milestones in her life and the dress she was wearing at the time.

Originally from Queensland but now based in Melbourne with quite a few other stops in between, she has collected dresses to mark her experiences around Australia and the world. 

But she admitted it was extremely difficult to decide just which frocks would make the cut.

'It's almost like my wardrobe is a bit of a zoo and they're all different animals... The zoo of dresses they all called to me they were howling and hooting and tweeting,' Ms Vashti said.

'I really chose the dresses that had a big impact, where I thought I had really changed', she revealed. 

The book chronicles her life for a decade and the events and milestones associated with certain dresses, starting with this frock which she associates with her 20th year

This dress marks her 25th year, and was originally a child's cape which she altered so it would fit

Each dress is associated with a particular crossroad or milestone in the 34-year-old's journey through her twenties, though this one she refers to as her Once Upon A Time dress which relates to her younger self

In her twenties she 'sunk into this obsessive behaviour' where she could not leave the house in an outfit that didn't 'feel right'.

'During those early years I didn't really understand I was getting depressed and it really hit me, this became a behaviour that was really obsessive.'

This notion is explored through the book and Ms Vashti said: 'I think it's definitely something a lot of women would relate to and it's really personal... It's a very emotional thing.'

'I was almost killed by my wardrobe', she added, referring to it in both a mental and physical sense - she had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses.

Named the Rockefeller Thai Wedding, this frock associated with her 28th year was worn to at party at the Rockefeller Centre in New York and two years later to a friend's wedding in Thailand 

Ms Vashti purchased this vintage dress for her 30th birthday and describes it as 'a mix of 1940s and 1980s'

Dresses like this elegant lace one which is number 22, have been kept for decades and Ms Vashti has become more attached to them since she wrote the book 

Many of the 34-year-old's favourite frocks were handmade or passed down from her mother and two older sisters, and these are the ones that hold the most memories.

The one that is most special to her is a paisley shift dress which Ms Vashti's mum originally wore when pregnant with her eldest daughter.

'I love that one, it's just so saturated with meaning. I remember clearly my elder sisters wearing it out to parties in the '90s,' Ms Vashti said.

She gave birth to her own daughter just four months ago, and revealed 'I even wore it when I was pregnant!', though admitted the '60s dress was a little short when her belly filled it out and now served as more of a top than a frock.

Her favourite dress of all was one her mother first owned (left)  which went through both her sisters' wardrobes before it landed in her hands (right)

Now with a daughter of her own, she hopes that some of her vast clothing collection will be passed down another generation 

While Dress, Memory - which evolved from her blog of the same title - was an attempt to let go of the dresses she had become so attached to, Ms Vashti said the exact opposite occurred.

'They've got more meaning now than ever... It totally backfired on me - I feel like a fool!' she laughed.

Now with a bigger collection of dresses than ever, Ms Vashti said her own mother's penchant for keeping clothes for decades had a huge impact on the way she thought about what she wore.

'It influenced me immensely - it's almost like I saw these clothes modelled on real life models (mother and sisters) before I wore them,' she said.

In the book Ms Vashti tells of her time spent in a band in her early twenties, and the dresses she used to wear on stage

The book originally evolved from a blog, and tells of the huge impact her own mother's wardrobe had on her relationship with clothing

 Ms Vashti had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses

There is a lot of focus on how each dress made her feel when she stepped out of the house

'I was able to see how they moved and I think I was excited by the way I could see them come to life.'

The author speaks, and writes, about the dresses almost as if they are a part of her, intrinsically linked to the woman she was each time she wore a particular one.

'For the actual process of writing I put on those dresses and sat down and typed remembered what it was like to be that girl,' Ms Vashti said.

By the end of the book it is evident how much the 34-year-old has grown, and she had one more thing to add for her readers.

'You wont always be that 22-year-old girl wondering whether you will feel right.'
