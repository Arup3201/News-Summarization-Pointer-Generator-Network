Despite delighting British taste buds for 52 years, it seems the Creme Egg recipe isn't sacrosanct to its new American owners.

They’ve tinkered with the traditional formula by getting rid of the much-loved Cadbury Dairy Milk shell and instead using what critics say is an inferior and nasty chocolate.

The swap has left a bitter taste in the mouths of Creme Egg fans, with many taking to Kraft’s Twitter feed and Facebook page to express outrage.

Cadbury has reportedly changed the shell of the Creme Egg, pictured, and is now using a standard cocoa mix rather than Dairy Milk

‘They taste really cheap and poor quality this year – #refund,’ wrote one yesterday. Another complained: ‘Why oh why did you sell out to Yanks? Their sweeties are awful.’

And Luke Keenan asked the question on most people’s lips: ‘Why mess with the Creme Eggs? No need!’ Kraft, which makes 200 million Creme Eggs a year, met each complaint with the same reply: ‘Our eggs still consist of the Cadbury milk chocolate and yummy creme centre fundamentals they always have.’

The Chicago-based company denied the new chocolate was a cheap substitute – insisting it was virtually identical to Cadbury Dairy Milk in that it was a blend of the same milk, cocoa and sugar.

However, analysis of the ingredients reveals there is less cocoa – 14 per cent compared with 20 per cent in Dairy Milk – so it is probably cheaper to make. And the difference certainly hasn’t fooled consumers. Creme Egg fan Mark Bardney blasted: ‘It’s not the same chocolate recipe – please stop lying to us!’

Chocolate giant Cadbury have downsized its boxes of Creme Eggs and are now selling them in packs of five

Previously, the chocolate treats were sold in boxes of six and making the boxes smaller has angered some chocolate fans 

Many Cadbury customers took to to Twitter to complain about the reduction in Creme Eggs found in each box

Creme Eggs have been part of British culture since 1963, when they were introduced by Cadbury as Fry’s Creme Eggs. The name was changed in 1971 but the taste of the iconic Easter treat had remained the same.

Now Kraft has not just meddled with that recipe – it has also changed the size of the popular multipacks.

Yesterday the Mail told how the number of eggs in each pack has been cut from six to five, meaning the cost per egg has risen from 50.8p to 57p.

The new recipe was taste-tested with consumers before the eggs went on sale this month, a Kraft spokesman said. ‘The fundamentals of Cadbury Creme Egg remain exactly the same – delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love.’

He explained that the decision to use a new recipe ‘meant we could utilise our chocolate supplies within the factory more efficiently’.

It’s not the first time that Kraft, which paid £11.5 billion for Cadbury in a controversial 2010 deal, has come under fire for undermining the historic British brand.

Bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a Cadbury factory at Keyn-sham, near Bristol, in 2011. They were also criticised for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in Poland.

Cadbury chocolates have been getting smaller, too, with the 140g bar of Dairy Milk shrinking to 120g, and tins of Roses being pruned from 975g to 753g.
