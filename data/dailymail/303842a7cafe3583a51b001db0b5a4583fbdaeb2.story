Manchester United forward Robin van Persie was pulled over by police on Thursday morning while driving on the M60 near Sale, Greater Manchester.

The Dutchman, who scored in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League win against Burnley on Wednesday, was stopped in his Range Rover as he made his way to Manchester United's Aon Training Complex.

A female police officer spoke to the 31-year-old for a few minutes before letting him link up with the rest of his United team-mates without punishing the Dutchman.

Van Persie is said to be a major doubt for Manchester United's upcoming fifth round FA Cup clash against Preston North End.

The Dutch international played the full 90 minutes against Sean Dyche's side but is said to have picked up an injury knock.

Red Devils duo Phil Jones and Daley Blind, who were both forced off during the first half of United's recent Premier League victory, could also miss Monday night's FA Cup clash at Deepdale.

Louis van Gaal said: ‘Jones is not a heavy injury but it will be difficult for him.

'We’ll have to wait and see how Blind recovers and Van Persie has something. I gave the players the day off (on Friday) and only the injured players are in.’

Van Persie scored Manchester United's third goal in his side's 3-1 win against Burnley on Wednesday
