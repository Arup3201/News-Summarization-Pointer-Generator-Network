Zoe Eckersley branded Cheshire East Council's decision not to empty her green bin because she had disposed of pumpkin seeds, a 'joke'

Having scooped out the seeds from a pumpkin so her children could make a Hallowe'en lantern, Zoe Eckersley thought she was doing the right thing by putting them in her green bin.

After all, she reasoned, pumpkins grow in gardens, so their seeds surely belonged with the hedge trimmings and dead leaves.

However the mother-of-two hadn't reckoned with the bureaucratic machine which today polices exactly what rubbish should go in which bin.

Her bin - brim-full of garden waste for the final collection before next Spring - was left unemptied, with a lurid yellow form identifying the pumpkin seeds she had left at the top as the culprit.

When she complained, the 40-year-old was told she had risked spreading disease - and that no home-grown fruit or vegetables could be put in the green bin either.

Yesterday the property developer's wife said that even as a conscientious supporter of recycling, the rule was a 'joke'.

'The ridiculous thing is that the actual pumpkins had to go in my neighbour's green bin because ours was full, but because they were covered up by grass from the lawn, the binmen didn't spot it,' she said.

'If I'd put the seeds in with the general waste, everything would have been taken away as normal, but because I tried to do the right thing I've got a full green bin which no-one will collect.

'They say mixing food and garden waste can spread foot and mouth disease, but plenty of councils allow you to mix them.

'And if it's so important to keep them separate, surely the council need to inform people rather than just catching the odd person by lifting up their bin lid?'

Mrs Eckersley, of Knutsford, Cheshire, who works for her 41-year-old husband Matthew's property firm, asked the council if they would come back and empty the bin if she removed the seeds, but they refused.

She now faces waiting until the Spring for the next garden waste collection or laboriously emptying the bin into bags and taking them to a recycling centre.

In addition, she has been told by Cheshire East Council that no fruit or vegetables grown in her garden can be put in the green bin.

The council said Mrs Eckersley risked spreading disease by mixing food waste with garden cuttings

'We grow strawberries and I asked what I should do if I need to dispose of berries that have been pecked at by birds or spoilt,' she said.

'Apparently the berries themselves need to go in the black bin or be composted.

'Only the strawberry plant and leaves can go in the green bin. Rhubarb leaves are OK though, apparently.

'Another friend had ten pumpkins to dispose of. They took them to Knutsford tip and were told to put them in the garden waste section.

A yellow note left on her bin, informed Mrs Eckersley of the collection team's decision. The next collection date is not until next spring

'I just find it absolutely bizarre. It's an absolute joke.'

In an email from the council's customer services team, Mrs Eckersley was told: 'The waste department are unable to return to empty your bin because the crew found food waste in your bin.

'We cannot accept any food waste, including vegetables/seeds from your garden. This is because of foot and mouth restrictions on the farmland we use to dispose of your waste.'

As Mrs Eckersley does not receive a kerbside food waste collection, she uses a waste disposal unit instead.

The only other separate bin the family have is a silver one for paper, cardboard, plastic bottles and cans, which they use so much they have been allocated a second.

Councillor David Topping, cabinet member in charge of the environment, said: 'All of our waste collection crews are trained to assess the contents of garden bins before they are emptied into the collection vehicle, and they will not be emptied if the crew find any waste that could be considered as food waste.'

As garden waste was sent to local farms for composting, they could face prosecution if food waste was mixed in, he added.

Councillor Topping said the council's household waste recycling centres were the only exceptions as they did accept home-grown fruit and vegetables in the garden waste skip.

The council hopes to save £1million by stopping green waste collections between November and March.

In 2009, John Mason of Connah's Quay, Flintshire fell foul of the bin police by putting bruised windfall apples from his back garden in his green bin.

Householders who persistently flout the rules could be hauled to court and fined up to £1,000.
