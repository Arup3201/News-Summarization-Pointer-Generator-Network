Michael Schumacher's wife is devoting hours at his bedside to try and coax the star out of his artificially-induced coma.

Corinna, 44, has been talking to her stricken husband every day without any sign of response.

Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital in France.

Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all

The 45-year-old has been at the 
hospital in Grenoble since he fell and hit his head on a rock while 
skiing in the French resort of Meribel on December 29.

The anaesthetic is being reducled extremely gradually while pockets of the drugs that have built up in his body's fatty tissue have to be coaxed out.

Doctors have told his family that the toughest phase in his recovery is yet to come.

They
 have warned Corinna, and children Gina Marie, 16, and son 
Mick, 14, that it could take weeks for all of the sleeping drugs to be 
out of his body.

During this time, Schumacher will be under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all.

Neurosurgeon Professor Heinzpeter Moecke said it remains a mystery how much awareness coma patients have of the outside world.

He
 added: 'We are sure that familiar voices, such as those of family 
members, present a calming effect. They give you a sense of security.'

Rolf Schumacher, his brother, and Ross Brawn, Schumacher's former team boss, and Ferrari pal Jean Todt are among those who have spoken for long periods at the bedside where he is hooked up to a mind-boggling array of machines.

Following his accident, Schumacher was helicoptered to the University of Grenoble Hospital where he was not expected to last the night.

The coma was induced to decrease the brain's activities, with the hope that it would heal more rapidly.
