Romantic: Adam Wood who is looking for a new girlfriend for Valentine's Day after he booked a night in a hotel and dinner as a treat for his girlfriend who dumped him two days later

A student who splashed out on a romantic Valentine's evening for two in a bid to spoil his girfriend only to be dumped two days later has started an internet campaign to find a replacement date.

Adam Wood, 20, was keen to ensure that he didn't spend Valentine's Day in the doghouse this year when he planned well ahead and organised a romantic evening for himself and his then girlfriend back in November.

But romantic Adam found himself single just two days after booking a non-refundable table at a restaurant and a £100 stay at the Hilton hotel in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

And with less than a week to go until the big day, Adam has taken to Twitter looking for a single lady to accompany him on the night.

Adam, of Bromley, South London, said: 'I foolishly pre-booked the whole thing so far in advance and now I can’t get a refund.

'Back in November, I planned this amazing night as a surprise for my girlfriend and it was the most romantic gesture I’ve ever made. Sadly, we broke up just two days later after dating for about a year.

'I’m making this plea in the hope someone will join me and we can have a laugh and hopefully a great night.

'I’m not necessarily looking for romance or placing big expectations on this date. I’m just hoping to have a lovely evening and stop it all going to waste.

'I don’t mind what my Valentine is like - I’d just love some company.'

Adam, who is studying English language and literature at Leeds University, is already well on his way to becoming an internet sensation after starting a campaign on Twitter called 'Find My Valentine'.

He said: 'I can’t believe the reaction it’s had on the internet. I’m in shock at how quickly it’s spreading and I hope this helps me find my Valentine.

'It all started two days ago when I was sitting around with some flatmates and we were thinking of ways I could find the perfect Valentine for the evening.

'Initially, it was big amongst my friends but since writing about it on Twitter and Facebook, it has become huge.'

Adam has also written his plea on his Facebook page, which states: 'As we all know, Valentine’s Day occurs next week, with happy couples everywhere enjoying their romantic day whilst us singletons are forced to stay at home.

'So, I ask whether any of you single girls out there could be persuaded to join me on an evening where you are free to laugh at my tragic stupidity and misfortune in pre-booking the whole thing.

'The evening includes: Dinner at Leeds’ best restaurant, drinks at Leeds’ best bar, and a night at Leeds’ best hotel (with Leeds’ best breakfast included...).

'You never know, it could be your (Leeds best) date ever!

'So ladies, please feel free to contact me, and for anyone who just wants to laugh at the whole situation, please do. But remember to ‘like’, share, and retweet so more people can laugh at me and so I can #FINDMYVALENTINE!'
