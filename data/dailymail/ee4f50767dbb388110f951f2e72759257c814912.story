Amazon has launched a low cost, big screen Kindle tablet to take on the iPad.

The new Kindle Fire HD has an 8.9inch screen - just slightly smaller than Apple's 9.7inch iPad screen.

It also boasts stereo speakers, and can be plugged directly into a HDTV to show films on a big screen.

Amazon CEO and chairman Jeff Bezos holds up the new Kindle Fire HD 7" and Kindle Fire HD 8.9", which goes on sale in the UK today

The tablet uses Amazon's own film, music and app stores - and the firm says 50,000 apps are available.

The big screen tablet was launched in the US last year, but Amazon is now launching its larger tablet in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Japan. 

In the US, it has cut the price of 
its largest Kindle Fire tablet, part of an effort by the world's biggest
Internet retailer to get the device into the hands of as many consumers
as possible.

It hopes the new Kindle will steal sales away from Apple's iPad as it is far cheaper.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch Wi-Fi tablet will now be priced at $269 in the United States, down from $299.

The 4G wireless version now starts at $399, compared with $499 before, Amazon said.

The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 will compete with Apple's iPad and the plethora of Android tablets on the market

Dave Limp, president of Amazon's Kindle business, said the company has increased production of the devices in conjunction with the overseas launch.

The cost of making the tablets has fallen with greater economies of scale, letting Amazon cut prices, he said.

'Whenever we are able to create cost efficiencies like this, we want to pass the savings along to our customers,' Limp said.

The move will put Amazon in a head-on battle with Apple. 

The new Kindle will compete with both the full sized iPad, which had a 9.7 inch screen, and the iPad Mini with its smaller 7.9inch screen.

The gadget will also compete with tablets running Google's Android software, including the search giants own Nexus 7 and 10 tablet, and Microsoft's Surface and Surface Pro tablet.

Experts say Amazon is willing to make little or no money selling cheap tablets and 
e-readers because it wants to get the devices into as many hands as 
possible, then sell higher-margin digital content, such as e-books, 
video, games, apps and music, to a more connected and engaged customer 
base.
