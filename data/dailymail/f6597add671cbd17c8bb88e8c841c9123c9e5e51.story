For those who live in fear of our eight-legged friends, it's the stuff of nightmares.

Engineers in Hong Kong have made a robotic spider that accurately replicates the creepy leg movements of real arachnids.

The Robugtix T8 robot contains 26 little motors under its 3D printed case to make the spider move in a way that will certainly scare those terrified of the creatures.

The Robugtix T8 robot contains 26 little motors under its 3D printed case - three in each leg and two in its abdomen - to make the spider move in a realistic way

Each of the robo-tarantula's legs houses
three motors, with two more used to animate the creature's abdomen, 
allowing it to strike scary poses.

The 3D printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called Bigfoot Inverse Kinematics.

The means that the master of the octopod does not have to send the robot intricate instructions.

Using a wireless controller, an 
individual can select a gait and tell the spider in which direction to 
travel, making it ideal for stealth attacks and pranks.

The engine handles all the complex mathematical theory and calculations required to control a multi-legged walking robot, leaving the operator free to focus on what it actually wants the spider to do.

For example, a user can tell the spider to walk forward at a certain speed, while the engine takes care of detail such as inverse kinematics, leg trajectory planning and motor control. 

The company selling the robot says: 'This makes it quite easy even for absolute beginners to 
play with advanced robotics.'

The 3D printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called Bigfoot Inverse Kinematics. It handles all the complex maths needed to control a multi-legged walking robot so the user only has to issue simple instructions

Unlike the T8 robot, real tarantulas (pictured) come in over 900 varieties and it is thought that they produce small quantities of silk from their feet, enabling them to cling to smooth surfaces

Owners of the scary toy may want to refrain from shocking a friend with arachnophobia and a good aim though, as the robotic mini beast costs over £900.

The robot is the brainchild of a research, engineering and design company called Amoeba Robotics in Hong Kong, which specialises in making innovative robotics systems.

It is on sale from the Robugtix website that creates bio-inspired multi-legged robots and is expected to ship in September.

Luckily, for those who want more terror for their money there is a slightly less-realistic six-legged robot available for just over £160.

The IITSII is a hexapod version of the T8 that contains 18 motors instead of 26, so there are still three in each leg.

As there are no motors in the insect critter's body, it can't pose like it's spider peer, but still uses the same engine to move around in a realistic way.

Both scary products come as kits and need to be built. The Controllers cost extra but there is scope for technophiles to create their own communication methods with the robots as they are open devices.

Users of spider bot can choose between pre-programming their own sequences or directly controlling the robot in real time with 
the wireless Robugtix Controller.
