A tight-knit Native American tribe is grappling for answers after Friday's high school shooting when one of their own shot four of his friends at point-blank range then killed himself.

Jaylen Fryberg's rampage, the latest in an increasingly frequent number of mass gun attacks, sent shock waves through the Tulalip Tribe, one of the most economically and politically successful  Indian communities in the US.

Just weeks before, he had been joyfully riding bikes with his two brother-like cousins Nate Hatch and Andrew Fryberg - who were both left in a critical condition after the attack.

Desensitized? People suggested gun crime is now a desensitized subject as shootings are more frequent

Questions: The Tulalip tribe is grappling to ascertain what drove Jaylen Fryberg to shoot his friends in the head

'For our generation, we couldn't have even fathomed something like this,' said Marysville resident Frank Ripley, standing near a makeshift memorial of flowers and notes near the school. 

'For some of these kids, they've now heard about it so many times ... they almost in a way are desensitized to it.'

As three teenagers continue to fight for their lives, it appears the attack will have a minimal effect on the nation's stance on gun laws.

It comes after a Harvard and FBI report revealed this month that mass shootings are becoming more frequent, with an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents from 2007 through 2013, more than double the 6.4 average from 2000 to 2006. 

Citizens are expected to turn out in droves to a vote next week on Washington's proposed adjustments to gun laws - whether or not to widen or limit background checks - in reaction to the shooting.

However, with a minuscule fatality count in comparison to previous shootings, analysts predict the knock-on effects will not cross state borders.  

Jaylen, the shooter, carried a .40 caliber handgun, reportedly owned by his father, which he used to kill himself, police said. 

Relatives have identified the two male victims as cousins he treated like brothers: Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15.

Hatch, in serious condition with a gunshot to the jaw, improved on Sunday, while Andrew Fryberg was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, hospital officials said.

Female victims Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, remained in critical condition at a different hospital, officials said. 

Zoe Galasso, 14, was killed in the attack. 

The boys were all members of the Tulalip Tribe, which has boosted Snohomish County's economy with businesses and retail parks and even won the Governance of American Indian Nations award from Harvard University.

Tribal leaders recalled that Jaylen and Nate seemed like best friends, growing up doors away from each other near Marysville on the reservation that 2,700 Indians call home.

They rode four-wheelers along back roads near the Puget Sound just months ago, played video games after school, went to the movies and played basketball and football together, family members said.

Struck: The Tulalip tribe, one of the nation's most successful Indian communities, is reeling in shock

Devastating: Tribe members said they have no idea what led Jaylen to unleash his deadly attack and kill himself

The boys were also often together with the victims, attending the ceremonial First Salmon festival in June and, on the Saturday before the shooting, Jaylen and all the victims went to a high school dance together.

Jaylen's deadly outburst just days later left the thriving community baffled.

'It's just so devastating,' Deborah Parker, a Tulalip board member and national expert on violence against American Indian women, told the Seattle Times. 

'We just don't know how it all adds up.' 

A Native youth counselor Matt Remle told the paper tribal leaders will consider whether his dual culture had anything to do with the outburst.

'None of us can really say what led him to that,' Remle said. 'But you could say that when you're part of another culture, that's just an added stress on top of what is already a very stressful time in every kid's life.'

But he added: 'They're very family-oriented. All of them come from big families that love and support each other. That's what makes a lot of it unreal, I guess.'
