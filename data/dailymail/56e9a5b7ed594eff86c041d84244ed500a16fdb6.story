Earlier this week, anti-terror officers arrested a suspected terrorist bound for Syria at Melbourne Airport after he was allegedly found carrying images of beheadings and the ISIL flag.

The man, who is an Australian citizen, was allegedly also carrying $A30,000 and was with three family members when he was detained on a flight travelling to Beirut, Lebanon on Monday, the Herald Sun reported.

This comes after another man was arrested at Sydney Airport on Sunday after material related to the Islamic State was found in his luggage.

The man arrested in Melbourne was interviewed at the airport and released, but he remains under surveillance.

His family members were not suspected of illegal behaviour and were allowed to continue their journey to Beirut but they chose not to.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament that a new airport-based counter-terrorism squad had intercepted a suspect. He did not say whether it was the Sydney or Melbourne man.

The news comes as The New York Times reports Australia may support a potential US military mission to bomb ISIS targets in Syria.

Mr Abbott made the announcement during Question Time this afternoon.

Mr Abbott said the new Australian Customs and Border Protection counter-terrorism units have been put in place at Sydney and Melbourne international airports and the program is set to expanded.

'I'm advised these new units have already intercepted at least one person of interest,' Mr Abbott told Parliament.

'This government will do everything that is necessary to keep this country safe.'

Similar units will be established at other Australian international airports.

Eventually 80 officers will be stationed at airports to monitor the movements of people on the national security watchlist.

Daily Mail Australia has approached the Prime Minister's office and Customs and Border Protection for further detail.

An estimated 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with extremists in Syria and Iraq. The government believes there are a further 100 'facilitators' in Australia.

Yesterday Mr Abbott announced the government would pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation'.
