This was the moment a reckless biker tore past a girl riding a horse on a winding country road - at 104mph.

Garry James Wilkinson has been given a driving ban after his dangerous antics - putting the youngster, the animal and himself at great risk - were caught on a police camera.

The 41-year-old, from Huntington in Yorkshire, was snapped on a country road in Stillingfleet on June 27 by a mobile safety camera belonging to North Yorkshire Police.

Banned: The 41-year-old was given a 70-day ban after being captured on a police camera

CCTV still images show him racing
past just feet away from the horse and rider - although incredibly the 
horse was not startled and no one was injured.

Wilkinson admitted breaking the 60mph speed limit on the road when he appeared at Selby Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.

He was also fined £360 and ordered to
pay costs of £45 and a victim surcharge of £15 - as well as being 
banned from driving for 70 days.

Traffic Constable Zoe Billings of 
North Yorkshire Police, said: 'The disregard shown by Wilkinson for the 
safety of the horse and rider is shocking. 

'The horse was clearly visible to him
as he approached along the straight road. It was only because of the 
very good road sense of the animal that a serious incident was avoided.

'Wilkinson should think himself fortunate to have been facing a speeding charge and nothing more serious.'
