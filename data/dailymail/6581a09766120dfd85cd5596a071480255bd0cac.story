The presents are wrapped, the menu is sorted, the booze is all ready to glug.

Emma Mumford should have spent well over £600 on Christmas for her family of four. Instead it is costing her £100.

Meet Britain’s bargain queen, a 20-year-old who devotes much of her life to finding money-off coupons and free gift vouchers, spotting wrongly underpriced goods and charming companies into sending her sample products.

Bargain hunter: Emma Mumford should have spent £600 on Christmas for her family of four. Instead it is costing her £100

Emma's Total Christmas saving is £540.22, and she will pay just £25 for all of her festive food and drink

It is an obsession that has saved
 her thousands of pounds. Supermarket bosses must tremble as her eagle 
eye scans the aisles to bulk-buy discounted goods. And woe betide a 
website that mistakenly chops a couple of noughts off its prices. 

She
 is all set for Christmas lunch with her partner Ben and her parents and
 will hand out more than £500 worth of presents, which cost her less 
than £75, on December 25.

Only the turkey is on hold – she has 
budgeted £7 in her £25.39 food bill to get a last-minute deal on 
Christmas Eve.

Miss Mumford explained yesterday: 'I just love getting a bargain, it really is addictive. I have 
been doing my Christmas shopping all year round, whenever there was a 
good deal or voucher.'

She first started trying to save money after an illness left her temporarily unable to work.

The
 savvy shopper, from Weymouth, Dorset, scoured the internet for deals 
and spent hours painstakingly printing and cutting out coupons.

Emma uses the internet to search for as many deals and coupon sites as she can, and spent hours painstakingly printing and cutting out her coupons

Sometimes
 taking advantage of an offer means bulk-buying things she does not need
 immediately, including a year’s stock of toilet rolls and a box of 
Christmas crackers bought in August.

She said: 'I knew I needed to make some savings somewhere and I had no idea how I was going to manage.

'One day I was watching a TV programme about extreme couponers and I thought I would give it a go.'

When
 there is a specific deal on, Miss Mumford will make sure she takes full
 advantage of it, even if it means bulk buying a lot of products.

She
 has been collecting for Christmas throughout the year and managed to 
buy six crackers for just £2.50 in from her local Co-op in August.

Emma’s
 Christmas gift list includes items such as jewellery, nail varnish, 
perfume and even a Fujifilm digital camera which she bought for £30 
reduced from £160, with vouchers she had saved up.

Emma says one of her biggest savings was on puppy food for her new dog Max

Emma
 said: 'It really is worth spending the time collecting vouchers for the
 money you can save. I hate paying full price for anything.'

Emma has paid just £25 for all of her festive food and drink, including Christmas dinner for her family of four.

She managed to obtain free frozen 
potatoes, yorkshire puddings, advent calendars and selection boxes by 
writing to to food companies.

Emma
 will be waiting until Christmas Eve to buy her turkey and fresh veg, as
 they will be considerably reduced and is hoping to buy them all for 
less than £10.

Emma said: 'Getting the best deals does sometimes mean you have to buy only certain things, but its worth it for the savings.

'I
 currently have 90 cans of Coke, ready for Christmas, a stack of toilet 
and kitchen rolls which will keep me going at least six months and a 
huge supply of shampoo and toiletries.'

'It’s not a conventional way to shop, but it really works and it great for making savings.'

She has now signed up for alerts so she never misses out on new coupons or deals.

She said: 'I have a room where I have stockpiled all my items, which is more than £1,000 worth of stuff.

The 20-year-old, who works in retail, said: 'It takes a bit of effort in the beginning to set everything up but once you spend the time signing up to the deal sites then it’s really simple and the savings I make are amazing.'

Emma has also picked up bargains by taking advantage of online 'glitches' where entering certain codes or products results in a discount.

But her top advice is straightforward.

She said: 'The best way to do things 
is the write to the companies praising their products and they will 
often reward feedback with vouchers and free samples.'

She
 said: 'One of my biggest savings was a year’s supply of puppy food for 
£6 where it should have been £66, 12 boxes of Special K for £8 instead 
of £47.90 and 30 bottles of Coke Zero for free.

My biggest shop saving was £33 worth of food shopping which I paid £2.67 after deals and coupons.'

Emma
 said: 'I honestly wouldn’t change my lifestyle, I make such great 
savings and I can relax this Christmas knowing I only spend £100 and all
 my family are going to be happy.'

Research carried out by VoucherCodesPro into the amount of money the average UK family of four spends £440.50 on Christmas food.

The average person will spend around £575.00 on Christmas gifts for family, friends and colleagues.

Emma has spent a total of £99.89 on her Christmas haul and through her clever couponing has saved herself a staggering £540.22.
