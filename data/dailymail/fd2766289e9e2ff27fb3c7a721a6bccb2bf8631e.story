An Iowa cop was either thanking his lucky stars or wondering 'why me?' on Wednesday after a 30-foot oak tree fell on top of him during a routine traffic stop.

Centerville police officer Jeremy Veach thankfully had time to hit the ground before the oak could harm him too badly, though an inch or a few seconds difference could have meant his life.

'I heard a couple cracks,' Veach recalled. 'A very loud pop. In hindsight, I had time to think, "Holy cow, a tree is falling."'

Freak accident: Centerville, Iowa police officer Jeremy Veach had a brush with death during a routine traffic stop Wednesday when a 30-foot oak fell on top of him out of nowhere. Here, Veach can be seen just before the tree toppled after pulling the car over for driving without headlights

'I heard a couple cracks, a very loud pop. In hindsight, I had time to think, "Holy cow, a tree is falling,"' said Veach, who's seen here hitting the pavement to get out of the tree's crashing path and then, at right, as the tree is right on top of him

'Fortunately for me and unfortunately for the owner of the vehicle, it absorbed a good portion of the impact,' said Veach

The shocking footage released by the Centerville PD and posted to YouTube by the Daily Iowegian shows precisely how close a call it was.

'It’s a wonder he’s not dead,' Veach's Chief of Police Tom Demry told the Iowegian.

Veach had only just pulled over the vehicle for driving without headlights when accident occurred.

Footage shows the tree come out of nowhere in winds that hovered around just 10MPH and completely shatter. An area resident said the tree showed no signs of disease.

'I was picking tree bark out of my ears, out of my hair. I mean it just exploded tree crumbs everywhere,' Veach said.

Shaking it off: Veach appears confused in the moments after the tree fell as he calls for help

While the officer managed to escape with his life intact and only what appeared to be a slight limp, the vehicle he stopped was not as lucky.

'Fortunately for me and unfortunately for the owner of the vehicle, it absorbed a good portion of the impact,' he said.

The car was totaled, reports KFOR, but Veach didn't wind up giving the driver a ticket after he climbed to his feet with a little help from a passerby.

'That’s the one true way to get out of a ticket,' joked the officer. 'You know, everyone asks police officers how you get out of a ticket. If a tree falls on you, you’re probably going to get off.'

A passerby soon comes to Veach's aid. He was largely unharmed, but the car he pulled over was totaled. He did not issue a ticket
