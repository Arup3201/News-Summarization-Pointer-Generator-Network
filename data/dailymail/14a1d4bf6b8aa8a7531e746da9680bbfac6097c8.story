A new craze has coffee drinkers blending two tablespoons of butter  into their morning brew in the hope of boosting energy levels, losing weight and feeling mentally alert.

The fad has taken the U.S. by storm and is now gaining traction in the U.K, with big coffee shop chains adding their own versions of the buttery coffee to their menus.

Known as 'fat black' and 'paleo coffee', it was formulated by American health guru Dave Asprey who discovered yak butter tea while traversing the Tibetan mountains.

Adding two tablespoons of unsalted butter - made from grass-fed cows - and a dash of coconut oil to morning coffee can provide six hours of energy, burns fat and improves cognitive function, American health guru Dave Asprey claims

Writing on his website, Mr Asprey said: 'I learned about the power of butter at 18,000 feet of elevation near Mt. Kailash in Tibet.

'I staggered into a guest house from the -10 degree weather and was literally rejuvenated by a creamy cup of yak butter tea.'

Mr Asprey says the coffee will give you energy for 'six hours if you need it', programs the body to 'burn fat for energy all day long' and 'improves cognitive function'.

The drink is made from a strict recipe of organic black coffee made from his trademark 'low toxin beans', which Mr Asprey claims are 'cleaner' than regular coffee.

A dash of medium-chain triglyceride oil – a supplement made from refined coconut oil - is then added. This 'improves brain energy' Mr Asprey says.

Next, two tablespoons of unsalted butter, preferable from grass-fed cows are melted in, and the mixture is whipped up into a froth.

According to Mr Asprey, butter contains all the benefits of healthy milk fat with none of the damaging proteins found in cream, making for 'the creamiest, most satisfying' cup of coffee. 

Advocates swear they feel mentally alert and top of their game, able to fire on all cylinders.

It is used by 'recording artists before they go on stage, world champion athletes, and some of the world’s top executives', Mr Asprey claims.

But others have described the taste as too rich and oily, leaving them feeling sick and uncomfortable.

Critics argue the underlying science is shaky, and fear bulletproof coffee is one of the greatest marketing cons of the century.

In fact, a study published in Anthropologist journal in 2004 found that Tibetan women who drank large amounts of butter tea stood a greater chance of becoming obese, 'increasing their risk for other health problems'.

Nutritionists also warn those who drink the coffee are replacing their more traditional, nutritious breakfast, with something that is low in essential nutrients.

And some argue butter is high in saturated fats, which raises the level of cholesterol in your blood and therefore increases your risk of heart disease and stroke.

Apparently the drink is consumed by 'recording artists before they go on stage, world champion athletes, and some of the world’s top executives', Mr Asprey claims

However, others say studies have shown saturated fat has been unfairly demonized. 

Research published in the American journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2010 found no evidence saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. 

And while butter and coffee may sound like an unlikely combination, it has actually been consumed around the world for years. 

Aside from the Tibetans Mr Asprey encountered, who do indeed drink yak butter and tea at high altitudes, Ethiopians commonly add spiced butter into their coffee. 

And in Singapore, coffee beans are often stir-fried with butter in a wok before being consumed.

Nutritionist Zoe Harcome says adding butter to coffee is not a recipe for a heart attack - as long as you avoid eating carbohydrates

Nutritionists and dietitians are divided on whether bulletproof coffee can be incorporated into a healthy diet or not.

Here nutritionist Zoe Harcome argues bulletproof coffee is not a path to a heart attack, while dietitian Azmina Govindji says it goes against all the principles of healthy eating.

 

ZOE HARCOME: ITS BETTER TO FUEL ON FAT 

Nutritionist Zoe Harcome says it's healthier to fuel on fat than carbohydrates.

She said: 'Bulletproof coffee is drank by people following what is called a LCHF diet - Low Carb High Fat. 

'This is a growing movement world wide of smart people who have worked out that fuelling on fat is much healthier and less fattening than fuelling on carbohydrate. 

'It is a direct rebellion to the Low Fat High Carb official dietary advice, which has proved so disastrous for obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic illness since the dietary guidelines were introduced in the late 1970s/early 1980s.

'The key point for those not familiar with LCHF is that you MUST do the low carb bit if you're going to do the high fat. 

'If you have a butter/coconut oil coffee with a slice of toast for breakfast you will highly likely gain weight. 

'People doing LCHF are invariably consuming 20-50g of carb a day - somewhere between a couple of mugs of greens up to 2 bananas a day (although LCHF followers won't eat bananas - they'll get their carbs from veg/berries and nuts).'

She added:  'Personally I would always have eggs/milk/yoghurt for breakfast, simply because these foods are nutritionally far superior to butter/oil. 

'Coconut oil provides a bit of vitamins E and K and nothing else of value. 

'Butter is good for the fat soluble vitamins, but not much else. 

'Eggs are a fantastic already for most vitamins and minerals.'

 

AZMINA GOVINDJI : GO FOR A SKINNY LATTE INSTEAD

Dietitian Azmina Govindji said: 'The idea of adding saturated fat to coffee goes against the principles of healthy eating and long term weight management.

Dietitian Azmina Govindji says coffee with semi-skimmed milk instead of fat will give a range of nutrients for long-term health

'Such faddy practices that promise speedy weight loss may well help you lose weight fast - but it's likely to creep back on again, and you may end up heavier than before you started.

'Adding extra fat to coffee means adding extra calories - the idea of opting for a skinny latte makes good sense, whereas adding the recommended amount of fat and butter to your coffee could set you back around 3-400kcal.

'It will probably fill you up more than a regular coffee, but having it for breakfast means there's less room for healthy breakfast foods that give you fibre and micronutrients.

'My advice would be to go for foolproof coffee - quality coffee made with semi-skimmed milk as part of a balanced whole grain breakfast.'

'It will fill you up, energise you, help keep your blood glucose levels steady, and give you a range of nutrients to keep you healthy in the long term.'
