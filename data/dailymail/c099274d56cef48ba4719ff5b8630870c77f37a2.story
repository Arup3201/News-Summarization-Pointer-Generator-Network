A runaway tractor came within inches of smashing into a house after the handbrake was accidentally knocked-off by the farmer's dog.

Henry Selway, 77, of Colyton, Devon, had parked his Ford 7840 tractor at the top of a slope while he met his daughter for lunch.

He left his Collie, Molly, in the vehicle’s cab but while he was away the vehicle suddenly began hurtling down the steep road.

The tractor hurtled down a slope after the handbrake fail, with farmer Henry Selway's dog Molly in the front seat. It ended up overturned in the front garden of a property in Colyton, Devon

The tractor trashed a garden fence and knocked down several trees after it careered through the garden in Colyton, Devon. Mr Selway's insurance company has agreed to cover the costs of the damage

The tractor, with Molly sat in the front seat, careered downhill, knocking down several trees before breaking through a garden fence.

It eventually flipped onto its side and came to rest in a front garden, just inches from a house. Molly the dog escaped the collision uninjured.

Mr Selway said he was shocked by the unusual incident.

He said: 'I parked my tractor as I always do - with the handbrake on and the wheels turned inwards.

'I
 only became aware of the incident when a scaffolder shouted over to me 
that the tractor was rolling off with my dog inside. I couldn’t believe 
it.

'The tractor caused quite a bit of damage, but thankfully no one 
was injured and the damage to the property was limited to the owner’s 
fence and a number of trees.'

The homeowners, who were away on holiday at the time, came home to find their garden fence trashed but their house unscathed.

Fortunately, Mr Selway's insurance company, Cornish Mutual, was able to cover the costs.

A Cornish Mutual spokesman: 'Thankfully no one was injured in this 
extraordinary case and the property affected only suffered superficial 
damage.'
