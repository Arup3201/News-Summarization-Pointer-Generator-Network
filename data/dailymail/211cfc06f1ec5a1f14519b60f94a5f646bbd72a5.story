Labour's pensions spokesman was branded 'out of touch' today after admitting she did not know how much the state pension was worth.

Rachel Reeves blundered during a live radio interview, when she insisted that 'of course' the payment was worth 'just under £100-a-week'.

When the shadow work and pensions secretary was told the true sum is actually £113.10, she tried to insist it depended how long people had been working for.

Wrong-footed: Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves was put on the spot during an interview on LBC with presenter Nick Ferrari

It is an occupational hazard for politicians to be put on the spot about the cost of everyday items – pints of milk, loaves of bread and the weekly shop have caught out David Cameron and Ed Miliband in the past.

But voters could expect Miss Reeves to know how much pensioners will receive each week from the state, as she draws up Labour's reforms to how people save for retirement.

Appearing on LBC radio, live from the Labour conference in Manchester, Miss reeves was asked how much the state pension is currently worth.

Host Nick Ferrari said: 'How much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person? What do they pull in a week now?'

Miss Reeves replied: 'It's just under £100 a week, the basic state pension, of course. Mr Ferrari asked 'Is it?' and she again insisted 'yes'.

But pressed again, Miss Reeves modified her answer to 'around £100 a week, of course', before Mr Ferrari put her right and stated it is worth £113. 

'So you don't actually know what the pension is?' the broadcaster declared. 

Forced on to the back foot, Miss Reeves added: 'It depends how many years you're contributed.'

However, the gaffe was ridiculed by the government, accusing Labour of not being on top of the detail of pensions policy. 

Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb told MailOnline: 'Sometimes when Labour criticised us on pensions, you wonder if they fully grasp how things work.

'For a shadow pensions minister not to know the value of the state pension suggests it is actually the opposition who are out of touch with our pensioners.'

Embarrassingly, Miss Reeves' error came less than 24 hours after she accused the government of overseeing an 'utter shambles'.

In her speech to the Labour conference, she claimed Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is a man 'with his own special Midas touch - everything he touches turns to a complete and utter shambles'.

Ms Reeves said the flagship reform universal credit was 'stuck in first gear', while work capability assessments were 'in meltdown' and the youth contract was an 'embarrassing flop'.

She said: 'It would be comical if it wasn't so criminal. We should be angry that taxpayers' money is being squandered. 

'That vulnerable people are being ill-treated. That lives are being scarred. That talent is being wasted. 'We should be angry - and they should be ashamed.

'The Tories will leave a truly toxic legacy. And for all their talk about cutting welfare, they've overspent on social security by £13 billion in this Parliament with a rising in-work benefits bill left for the next government.'

Rachel Reeves used her conference speech to accuse the government of an 'utter shambles'

During an interview on LBC radio, breakfast show host Nick Ferrari asked what seemed like an easy question for Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary.

But her answer suggested she is not on top of the detail of her brief, as this transcript shows:

Ferrari: How much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person? What do they pull in a week now?

Reeves: It’s just under £100 a week, the basic state pension, of course.

Ferrari: Is it?

Reeves: Yes.

Ferrari: The basic state pension is just under £100?

Reeves: It’s around £100 a week. Of course…

Ferrari: I thought it was £113.

Reeves: It’s around £100. If you…

Ferrari: So you don’t actually know what the pension is?

Reeves: It depends how many years you’re contributed.

Ferrari: Right.

Ferrari: I’m told the pension figure is £113.10, do you recognise that figure?

Reeves: It does depend, Nick, on how many years…

Ferrari: Well you’ve just said it’s under £100. It can’t be under £100.

Reeves: Well it depends on how many years you’ve contributed.
