Steven Hallsworth was jailed for 18 months today after blackmailing a female colleague with lewd pictures because she wouldn't go on a date with him

An IT Executive blackmailed a female colleague by threatening to reveal intimate pictures to her terminally-ill mother because she refused a date with him, a court heard.

Steven Hallsworth, 38, was described as a 'bully' by a judge today after sending anonymous text messages to the woman, threatening 'go on the game or give me money'.

Hallsworth obtained the images when they were leaked online by the victim's ex-boyfriend, Aylesbury Crown Court heard.

He then launched a cruel campaign of threats against the woman who he worked with.

The court heard how Hallsworth sent the woman a barrage of text messages threatening to show the images to her cancer-suffering mother after she declined his offer to go out in December 2010.

He even comforted the victim when she confided in him with her fears over the messages that were sent anonymously from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

When the woman suspected the 38-year-old was behind the cruel taunts, he stopped sending them until the following December.

Despite pleading she 'didn't need this right now,' the victim continued to receive threats and eventually went to the police.

She was also forced to reveal the ordeal to her ill mother in fear the intimate photographs would be posted to her house. 

Police were able to track the criminal through the phone he was using. Upon his arrest at his home in Ramsgate, Kent, officers found a laptop that stored the images in question.

Hallsworth pleaded guilty before being told by Judge Francis Sheridan: 'You are a bully and you took advantage of this young girl.

'Having spoilt one Christmas, you spoilt the next one and carried on until in to the next year.

The 38-year-old was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment by a judge who called him a 'bully' at Aylesbury Crown Court

'Such is the seriousness of this crime, I sentence you to 18 months imprisonment.'

Prosecutor Daniel Fugallo told the court how the victim 'started receiving text messages that called her a slag, referred to the 
photographs and suggested they would be sent to her mother if she did 
not pay some money.

'At this time, the complainant did not know who was sending these texts.
 She turned to her work colleague, the defendant, and confided in him.

'He was supportive in relation to these distressing texts that she was receiving. But, of course, he was the one sending them.'

The court heard Hallsworth was 'clearly attracted' to the woman, but she had declined to go out for a drink with him.

'The complainant started to suspect this apparent friend was the sender of the text messages because some of them mentioned private matters she had mentioned to him - like the fact she had become depressed because of the texts and had started taking medication,' Mr Fugallo added.

After responding with 'I don't need this. My Mum has cancer,' the victim received another message that read: 'Posted. Have a happy Christmas.' 

The images were described as the woman in 'various stages of undress', appearing in a tartan skirt while revealing her genitals, the court heard.

In one message, Hallsworth included one of the images saying: 'looking good aren't you'.

Another threatened: 'The pictures will get sent (to your mother) one day. Are they worth anything to you?'

Following his arrest in December last year, Hallsworth was interviewed and 'accepted sending the messages,' Mr Fugallo said.

'He said he started sending them to be silly because he was drunk and admitted it started because of feelings of rejection because she was not as interested in him as she was in her.'

'He said he was never after money; he just wanted to make her feel bad because she had rejected him.'

His legal representative, Shelley Webster, said her client had been drinking heavily at the time following the breakdown of his relationship.

'He found himself unable to trust women and to pursue new relationships. He spoke to his friends at the time who said he should get some counseling, but he was stubborn and did not seek counselling.

'He says he is genuinely sorry. It was not personal. It was just where his head was at, at the time.

'He realises what he did was wrong,' she said. 

Judge Sheridan also imposed a restraining order banning Hallsworth from contacting the woman or her mother.
