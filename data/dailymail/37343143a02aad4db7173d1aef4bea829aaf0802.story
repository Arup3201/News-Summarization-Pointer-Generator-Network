China could spy on British citizens and firms through its supply of broadband equipment to UK telecoms giants, Parliament’s intelligence watchdog has warned.

MPs on the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said they had serious concerns about the internet deals signed by BT and O2 with the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei.

China could ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’, their report said, adding that oversight of the firm in the UK is ‘feeble’ and suffers from the ‘absence of any strategy’.

Security risk: Chinese hackers could use weaknesses in equipment sold to British firms as an espionage opportunity, MPs said

Huawei supplies mobile handsets, 
routers and equipment in telephone exchanges and street cabinets to a 
string of British telecoms companies.

So scathing was the report that George
Osborne, the Chancellor, yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a 
statement in response to the ISC’s findings, stressing the importance of
Chinese investment in Britain.

Clearly anticipating a diplomatic row,
he said: ‘Inward investment is critical to generating UK jobs and 
growth. It is a personal priority of mine to increase trade links 
between the UK and China and I cannot emphasise enough that  the UK is 
open to Chinese investment.’

The MPs’ report even called for staff 
from the GCHQ listening agency to take over the running of Huawei’s 
cyber security evaluation centre which it built in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

Failings: The Intelligence and Security Committee, chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, said government action to address concerns had been unaccceptable

Huawei secured a contract with BT 
eight years ago as part of the £2.5billion super-fast broadband deal to 
supply two-thirds of British homes and companies by 2015.  The Chinese 
firm has also signed  deals with O2, TalkTalk and EverythingEverywhere.

National security concerns were 
sidelined in favour of money as the Chinese had managed to undercut 
local companies for the contracts, the report said.

Members of the ISC were ‘shocked’ that
ministers were not even informed about the BT deal until a year after 
it was signed. Chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘Such a sensitive 
decision with potentially damaging implications should have been handed 
to ministers. A lack of clarity around procedures, responsibility and 
powers means that national security issues have risked, and continue to 
risk, being overlooked.’

Ahead of the report’s publication, 
members of the committee had warned that it would be heavily censored 
because of the Treasury and Number 10’s fears of scaring away Chinese 
investors – claims denied by Downing Street.

Relations with China have been 
strained since David Cameron agreed to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s 
spiritual leader, last year. Granting him an audience was seen by 
Beijing as a terrible snub to China’s sovereignty over Tibet.

In its last annual report, the ISC 
said that a fifth of detected cyber attacks against the UK were so 
sophisticated that they had to be state sponsored or part of an 
organised crime ring.

China is often cited as one of  the main perpetrators of state- sponsored cyber attacks.

Suspicions: Questions have been raised about whether Huawei's intentions were 'strictly commercial or are more political'

A spokesman for Huawei said it was 
‘willing to work with all governments in a completely open and 
transparent manner to jointly reduce the risk of cyber security.’

In a statement BT said: ‘Security is at the heart of BT and it will continue to be so in the future.

‘Our testing regime enables us to 
enjoy constructive relationships with many suppliers across the globe. 
One of these is Huawei, with whom we have had a long and constructive 
relationship since 2005.’
