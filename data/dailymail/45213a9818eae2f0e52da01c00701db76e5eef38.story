A surge in the number of parents giving their children late baptisms has been linked to competition for places in popular Roman Catholic schools.

New figures from the church show the number of children baptised between the ages of one and 13 has soared by a third in ten years.

In the same period, between 2001 and 2011, the number of children baptised before their first birthdays decreased.

The figures, released by the Pastoral Research Centre Trust, show that 67,724 children were baptised in 2001. This increased to 74,767 in 2011, and decreased slightly to 71,380 in 2012.

The trust also revealed that 44,130 babies under the age of one were baptised in 2001, and that this fell by 2.6 per cent to 42,986 in 2011. This figure fell by a further 2.4 per cent – to 41,937 – in 2012.

But in this time the number of late baptisms soared by 36.2 per cent from 19,528 in 2001 to 26,601 in 2011. This then fell by 5.25 per cent to 25,225 in 2012, but this still represents a 30 per cent increase from 2001.

The Sutton Trust last month suggested parents 'get religion' so their children can go to faith schools

A report by the Telegraph suggested the trend – which has been shown in the Church of England as well – has been linked to ‘pew jumping’, where parents feign religion to get their children into faith schools.

Last month the Sutton Trust education charity highlighted a trend in which parents ‘get religion’ in order to help their children into good schools.

A survey of more than 1,000 parents revealed 10 per cent of upper middle-class parents admitted to going to church services in order to aid their children’s chances.

Jonathan Romain, chairman of the Accord Coalition, suggested to the paper that baptism can act as a ‘significant entry ticket’ into a Catholic school.

Following the release of the Sutton Trust report, he said: ‘These findings are highly revealing. For the first time they shine a light on the way the faith school admissions system is being abused towards serving the affluent, when most Church schools were originally establish to provide education for the poor.’
