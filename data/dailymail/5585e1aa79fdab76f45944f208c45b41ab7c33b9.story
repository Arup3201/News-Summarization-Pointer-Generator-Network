A former state wrestling champion died in mysterious circumstances this weekend - just a day after the funeral of a close friend whose death has been linked to heroin.

Daniel B. Kelly, 25, died Saturday. The talented wrestler, who attended Harvard for two years, came from Alexandria Township, New Jersey.

The young man had reportedly been distraught over the death of his friend Dylan Napolitan, 21, who died September 20.

After the death he posted on Facebook, saying 'I lost a best friend today. Dylan you will always be an inspiration for us all.'

According to the Hunterdon County Democrat, he went on to say: 'I feel blessed to have an angel friend up there to show me the ropes when I get there'.

Napolitan was found 'unresponsive' on the floor by State Police, who were called to his home in Kingswood, New Jersey, just after 3pm Saturday.

Though the cause of his death has yet to be officially established, police confirmed that they administered a chemical that can counteract the effects of heroin in a bid to save him.

Narcan, a drug which can block the effects of heroin and other opiates, was given to Napolitan, but did not prevent his death.

Kelly had an illustrious wrestling career when he was younger, winning the state championship in 2007. In his High School career he won 142 games and lost only 12.

He went to Harvard from Fall 2007 to Spring 2009, but did not stay there to graduate. He appears to have returned to New Jersey thereafter.
