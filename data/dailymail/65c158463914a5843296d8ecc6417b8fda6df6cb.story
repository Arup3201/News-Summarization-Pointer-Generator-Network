What do you call a sheep with two faces? 

That's the conundrum a Kiwi farming family has contended with since they discovered one of their ewes had given birth to a baby lamb with the unique deformity last Friday.  

'I've tried to think of a name for it but it's so unique that nothing really fits,' said farmer Justine Parker, from Slope Point Farms, near Invercargill at the southernmost point of New Zealand's South Island. 

One North Island radio station suggested they call it U2. 

But the family appears to have settled on a name thought up by Ms Parker's little girls, Anna, 10, and Sarah, 8, and Kate, 6. 

Two of everything! The family of Justine Parker and Andrew Wilson, who live near Invercargill at the southernmost point of New Zealand, have taken to calling the lamb 'Two Face'. 

Adored: Anna Parker, 10, Sarah Parker, 8 and Kate Wilson, 6, have taken a liking to the little lamb.

'My wee girls just called it Two Face,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. 

With four eyes, two noses and two mouths, Two Face is a little different from the rest of the flock.

But after the initial surprise of discovering the little lamb with 'two of everything', Two Face has fast become one of the family's favourite farm animals.

'We really care for him like one of our own now,' Ms Parker said. 

Rugged up! Ms Parker said: 'We really care for (Two Face) like one of our own.'

Cuddles! The children with Two Face, the lamb with 'two of everything'. 

Two Face's deformities have only caused him a few issues. 

He tilts slightly to the left when he walks and has some difficult feeding. 

But Ms Parker said Two Face appears to be a happy lamb who interacts with the other farm animals like normal.

'He's just a bit of a dude,' she said. 

Farmers often encounter deformed lambs, but it's rare for them to live this long.

'We do know - and the kids know - it's not going to live forever,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia.

'But for it to live this long is a bit of a miracle really.'
