Most people might not expect middle-class and middle-age parents to enjoy a video game that involves reckless driving, gunning people down and robbing banks, but a study has revealed otherwise.

Online players of Grand Theft Auto V are 33 per cent more likely to have children and are twice as likely to be married, as the average video game player, it said.

While most people imagine teenagers staying up into the early hours playing violent computer games, there was an 'uncharacteristic spike' in the number if 55 to 64-year-olds playing the new game.

Exponential Interactive analysed the behaviour of over two million Britons who have played Grand Theft Auto online and compared the data to the internet population and general video gaming audience to pick out characteristics most representative of a Grand Theft Auto fan.

Their findings might surprise quite a few people as they break the video gamer stereotype in a number of ways.

While younger people are the largest players of the game online, the next biggest group are 55 to 64-year-olds.

Despite the violent nature of the game ( a wallpaper is pictured), the majority of the Grand Theft Auto audience claims to be more interested in the arts and literature than in going to clubs and bars and have broad interests to reflect their family life

The study also said that Grand Theft Auto players are more likely to be shopping for suits and briefcases than players of other video games

The study said that Grand Theft Auto players are more likely to be shopping for suits and briefcases than players of other video games - some of which might be less violent.

While people working from home and seeking work unsurprisingly make up a large part of the Grand Theft Auto online audience, the game was also found to attract players from a variety of industries, from construction to the media.

Players of the game are also 54 per cent more likely to be in the middle income bracket, the study said.

Despite the violent nature of the game, the majority of the Grand Theft Auto audience claims to be more interested in the arts and literature than in going to clubs and bars and have broad interests to reflect their family life.

Players of the game are five times more likely to be interested in reading books - particularly historical texts - than other gamers and particularly enjoy Finding Nemo and The Big Bang Theory when it comes to picking something to watch on TV.

Suggesting that not all gamers are couch potatoes, the study found that Grand Theft Auto fans are 63 per cent more likely to be interested in running than the average gamer and have a 6.7 times greater interest in jet-skiing, that is possibly influenced by the game.
