Fined: A warden issued a parking ticket to this ambulance as paramedics treated an elderly patient

A traffic warden has sparked outrage after putting a parking ticket on an ambulance as paramedics stopped to help an elderly patient.

The overzealous attendant targeted the first response vehicle as the medics treated the pensioner, who had suffered a stroke at an arts venue in Christchurch, Dorset.

Shocked onlookers shouted and swore at the warden as he slapped a fine of up to £70 on the windscreen of the ambulance.

The two paramedics had parked the vehicle at the end of a lay-by outside the Regent Centre after receiving the 999 call at around 11am on Sunday.

However, in their rush, they pulled the ambulance's two front wheels onto the pavement.

While
they raced to the stroke victim, the warden arrived and put a parking ticket on the emergency vehicle - claiming it was causing a blockage to pedestrians.

Moments later, a second ambulance pulled up in Christchurch High Street and took the elderly man to Royal Bournemouth Hospital.

Richard
Day, 49, from Bransgore, was shopping with his wife and children when 
he saw the parking fine on the first ambulance's windscreen.

'We were walking up the high street and saw the ambulance car parked in the lay-by,' said the father of four.

'There
were loads of cars there so the front two wheels were further than the 
end of it and it was parked slightly on the pavement.

'Obviously
someone was in desperate need of emergency help so we were completely 
shocked that a parking warden would issue a ticket.

'I found this absolutely incredible and my whole family were astounded.'

He added: 'Plenty
of members of the public shared the same opinion and angrily shouted at
the traffic warden to have a heart and remove the ticket. But he just 
walked away.'

The parking ticket included a fine of between 25 and 35 pounds if paid within 14 days - increasing to between 50 and 70 pounds after that time frame.

However, Dorset County Council has since revoked the ticket after liaising with South West Ambulance Service.

Hilary Cox, the council's
cabinet member for environment, said: 'The whole situation seems 
completely ridiculous and I am gobsmacked.'

But Simon
Gledhill, the council's parking services manager, claimed the ambulance had been 'obstructing the highway'.

'It was parked over the zig zags on the approach to a junction controlled by traffic lights,' he said.

'The traffic warden saw that the vehicle was causing a clear hazard to the travelling and pedestrian public.

'Emergency
vehicles are treated like any other vehicle that causes an obstruction 
to the highway, unless their hazards lights are on.

'This indicates that they are on an emergency call and we will not give them a parking ticket.

'The vehicle was observed and there was nothing to indicate that this vehicle was on a call and was therefore ticketed.

'Discussions
have taken place with the ambulance service and we have agreed to rescind the penalty charge notice on this occasion.'
