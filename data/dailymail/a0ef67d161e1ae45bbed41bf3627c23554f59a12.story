Euphoric basketball fans spilled onto the streets of Miami for an impromptu party after the Heat claimed their second consecutive NBA title last night.

But this picture suggests that celebrations turned sour in at least one corner of the city.

It reveals a woman apparently being pushed to the ground by police officers as they attempted to clear the streets of jubilant Miami Heat fans.

Scuffle: A City of Miami Police officer appears to push a woman to the ground as the force attempts to clear a street of revellers following Miami Heat's victory over the San Antonio Spurs

One picture shows the woman tumbling onto the concrete, while another shows a police officer apparently trying to haul her to her feet by grasping her t-shirt.

She can then be seen pointing angrily at the City of Miami Police officers as they form a barricade with their bicycles.

But officials in the city said the jubilant scenes that followed Miami Heat's 95-88 victory over San Antonio Spurs passed largely without incident.

Fans swarmed from 
downtown bars and rushed cheering and screaming into the streets after their team won its second straight NBA championship.

As
the final seconds of the Heat's win over the San Antonio Spurs 
wound down, fans by the thousands streamed into the area surrounding the
AmericanAirlines Arena to exchange high-fives and hugs, blow whistles or simply scream.

Some climbed atop street signs and a railroad 
crossing.

'It's euphoria in the city of Miami,' said Alex Vailon, a 20-year-old Miami resident.

As with the Heat's two previous titles, 
officials said the city's celebration was generally peaceful - police 
chased away a few celebrants who were jumping on top of limousines that 
were leaving the arena.

Lt. Ignatius Carroll of the City of 
Miami Fire Department said early Friday that authorities had gotten no 
reports of major problems arising from the post-game celebrations.

He 
said there had been no gun-related incidents as of 1:30am, with the 
main problems earlier being fans jumping on cars and limousines outside 
the arena after the Heat won.

'It's a very peaceful celebration,' Carroll said, adding that the heavy police presence near the arena helped maintain control.
