They had sworn their loyalty to her 
father. They risked their necks in his name, too. There was only one 
guest of honour they all really wanted to see yesterday. And her bow to 
them and to their fallen comrades said it all.

If
 the protocol and the crowd control fell short (to be honest, at times 
it fell apart), it certainly didn’t bother the Queen as she was thronged
 by her father’s men yesterday.

And
 after a day of emotion, frantic diplomacy – enlivened by the presence 
of both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders – and some delightfully barmy 
French theatricals, the 70th anniversary of D-Day concluded last night 
with a forceful and personal speech from the Queen.

Cheers: The Queen toasts President Hollande during the state banquet held at Elysee Palace in Paris. In a powerful concluding speech, she said 'Everything we do, we do for the young'

Toast: The Royal raised her glass with the French leader at the elaborate venue. She also said: 'Each year has  compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War'

Tribute: Hollande said HRH 'personified the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On' in a warm toast at the event

Conversation: The Queen listened carefully to Mr Hollande during the banquet - where foie gras was served

‘The true measure of all our actions 
is how long the good in them lasts,’ she declared. ‘Each year has  
compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World 
War. Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in 
700 years as they do after 70.’

Noting
 ‘the joy of becoming a great-grandmother’, the 88-year-old Queen added a
 telling sentiment that will, no doubt, be much quoted by future 
historians: ‘Everything we do, we do for the young.’

To
 Normandy’s beaches had come the grandest gathering of world leaders 
since the London Olympics. It included seven monarchs and ten 
presidents, assorted prime ministers and cheeses of great magnitude from
 a couple of dozen governments and armed forces.

Yet the true stars of the show were those who had been on these very sands 70 years ago this very dawn.

They
 ‘marched’ through the streets of Bayeux, feted by flag-waving children 
and cries of ‘Merci’ as they made their way to Normandy’s largest 
Commonwealth cemetery.

There,
 they were joined by the one head of state who could well recall every 
moment of that longest day; who served in uniform; who heard her father 
broadcast to the nation that night; and who has always had a 
distinguished war veteran at her side – as he was yesterday.

The
 arrival of the Queen and Prince Philip was heralded by a full quartet 
from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight – two Spitfires, a Dakota and
 the mighty Lancaster.

Tribute: Four-year-old Megan Grey at the grave of her great-grandfather who died on D-Day

Historic: Michel Colas (centre) shows his grandsons Samuel Colas (left) and Rafael Schneider (right) the Normandy American Cemetery before the start of an official event with U.S. President Barack Obama

Respect: A Veteran looks at graves as HM The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh accompanied by The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall attend a service of Remembrance at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery

Salute: Former sailor Peter Smoothy aged 89 from Herne Bay, Kent pays his respects to fallen comrades

The 
sound of their Merlin engines and the sight of the Monarch, unmissable 
in bright green, galvanised several old chaps up and out of their 
wheelchairs.

Helpers sprung
 into action. They were struggling to their feet again as the bugle 
sounded the Last Post and the Queen laid the first of many wreaths, 
followed by the Prince of Wales, the Prime Ministers of Britain, 
Australia and France and the Governor-General of New Zealand.

And once the formalities were over, everyone wanted to have a word with the Sovereign.

‘My
 Dad’s meeting the Queen!’ shouted a lady from Southend charging through
 the crowd with a mobile phone. Don Sheppard, of the Southend branch of 
the Normandy vets, was indeed having a word.

Display: Thousands of attendees enjoyed a fantastic firework display at the International D-Day commemoration ceremony on Sword Beach

Show: Alpha jets, part of the Patrouille Acrobatique de France, leave trails of smoke in the colors of the French flag during the ceremony

So
 was Ronald Elliott, 92, from Yorkshire, who had come ashore on Juno 
Beach. Staying on the safe topic of weather, he said: ‘You didn’t order 
it did you?’ ‘I might have,’ the Queen replied.

Everyone
 had a story to tell. I met Jim Booth who sat in a midget sub waiting to
 guide the D-Day fleet. French-born Louisette Whitmore sheltered a badly
 injured RAF officer after his plane came down; he became her husband.

David
 Cameron heard Leonard Bloomfield, 93, had served with the Duke of 
Edinburgh in Gibraltar and steered him through the crowd to reunite him 
with the Duke.

Many veterans
 wondered if there was something different about the place this year. 
Indeed there was. A few years ago, the Commonwealth War Graves 
Commission noticed many of its Second World War graves were 
deteriorating at a much faster pace than those from 1914-18.

Group: The Queen and President Hollande stand before sitting at the top table along with Prince Philip, right

Royal welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip arrive at the Parisian venue this evening for a state banquet

Dressed for the occasion: Her Majesty wore an elaborate white gown and her crown for the Paris event

Greet: The Queen shakes hands with President Hollande - tonight's host - while Philip leaves the royal vehicle in the background. Her Majesty requested that Foie Gras was on the menu tonight

It
 turned out that as Britain emerged from chaos in 1945, Whitehall – 
shamefully – requisitioned all top grade Portland stone to repair 
government buildings. The commission ended up with the cast-offs.

So it has spent two years and £4million replacing 8,000 of the most vulnerable Normandy graves.

Among
 those paying their respects at a new headstone was four-year-old Megan 
Grey, plus doll, whose great-grandfather died on D-Day.

After
 meeting the commission team, the Queen went on to lunch with all the 
heads of state at the Chateau de Benouville, a wartime hospital. First 
came a group photo at which she was glad-handed by new Ukrainian 
president Petro Porochenko.

Hellos: The royal couple were actually a few minutes late for the state banquet - most likely delayed following a long day of arrangements for the 70th anniversary of D Day

Arrival: Hollande, who is single and so is attending the event alone, steps aside to allow The Queen and Prince Philip to walk up the red carpet towards the elaborate Palace

All
 eyes were on Russia’s Vladimir Putin, not least because of the Prince 
of Wales’s observations on his foreign policy. To the relief of British 
diplomats, the Prince was lunching with veterans elsewhere and Mr Putin 
kept a respectful distance. To be on the safe side, the Queen made sure 
she was deep in conversation with President Obama as they went through 
to lunch.

French diplomats 
had thought long and hard about where to seat Mr Putin. The solution was
 to slot him near the top of the table but in tranquil waters – between 
the Queen of Denmark and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.

After
 lunch, the leaders made the short journey to Sword Beach. Here the 
hosts erected a vast arena where the 3rd British Infantry Division came 
ashore on D-Day morning. A thousand British troops were killed or 
wounded on this spot, although the landings were more successful on 
Sword than anywhere else.

This
 was where Lord Lovat and his commandos came ashore to the sound of Bill
 Millin as he marched up and down playing the bagpipes.

Smiles: The Queen stops at the top of the steps outside Elysee Palace for photographs. The royals will dine on a menu of saddle of lamb and garden vegetables followed by Bourbon vanilla ice cream

Event: The Queen smiled for cameras outside the Parisian location. Hollande tonight said Her Majesty embodied the phrase 'Keep Calm and Carry On' in a warm toast to the royal

There were pipes once more here yesterday. President Francois  Hollande could have staged this ‘spectacle’ anywhere along D-Day’s 50-mile battlefront. But the French made much of the fact that they wanted to arrange things around the Queen. This had been a British beach. And, as by far the longest-serving head of state present, she had the honour of arriving last.

It seems pre-ordained that every anniversary of D-Day should turn into a shambles.

It happened on the 50th and 60th and yesterday was no different. As 7,000 guests sat baking in 26-degree heat, the world leaders ended up spending an extra hour over lunch.

We later learned Presidents Putin and Porochenko had been having a meeting at the chateau. This might have been of great significance  in geo-political terms. But it was  of little solace to more than 1,000  veterans waiting for the show.

Worthy of note: the warm applause for Angela Merkel. No German Chancellor has ever had a welcome like that at one of these events. Also worthy of note: Barack Obama chewing gum throughout.

Official: The Queen and Mr Hollande pose for a few pictures before making their way in to the top table

Guests: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and his wife Anne Gravoin stop for photographs on the red carpet

It was fabulously French. Black-clad dancers bounced on stage depicting the Nazi conquest while pyrotechnics did the rest.

Eventually, they were replaced by D-Day dancers plus much waving of flags. Finally, all the veterans took a bow, to thunderous applause.

The Queen’s state visit to France continues this morning. Last night, she was the guest of honour at an Elysee Palace banquet.

The day, she said, had left her filled ‘with sorrow and regret, remembering the loss of so many fine young soldiers, sailors and airmen; with pride, at the sheer courage of the men who stormed those beaches, embodied in the veterans among us; and with thankfulness’.

D-Day, she observed, reminded us of a great truth: ‘We should weigh our actions not by immediate acclaim, but by their benefit for future generations.’
