Little did they know when this sheet of paper was signed off that the worst case scenario would come true just 15 days later.

The original insurance certificate covering the ‘total loss’ of the Titanic for $5million (£3.1million) was revealed today, showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sank in April 1912.

And a handwritten amendment at the foot of the policy suggested the ship’s owners only insured the vessel for her sea trials and delivery journey from Belfast to Southampton as an afterthought.

Document: The original insurance certificate covering the 'total loss' of the Titanic for $5million (£3.1million) was revealed today, showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sunk in April 1912

The trials were due to take place in March but were delayed, possibly because she was not insured. The document states: ‘This policy is subject to total loss or constructive total loss of the vessel.’

The Titanic’s parent company, the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, received the full insurance payout within 30 days of the disaster in the Atlantic Ocean that saw 1,512 lives lost.

According to the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company policy, the firm had to pay an excess of $500,000 ($310,000).

The policy was arranged through brokers Willis Faber which assembled a consortium of insurers that each took a share of the risk.

Certificate: The document is being sold at auction in Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £15,000

One of the largest of the 77 partners was Atlantic Mutual, which paid out $100,000 (£62,000) of the claim.

'To our knowledge, it is without equal. It is an unremarkable piece of A4 paper but it holds the key to $5million'

Andrew Aldridge, auctioneer

Atlantic Mutual went bust in 2011 
following massive insurance pay outs in the wake of the 9/11 bombings in
New York City and Washington D.C.

Interesting and historic documents from its archives were put into an exhibition in New York last year which is when the Titanic ledger was purchased by a dealer.

He is now selling it at auction in Devizes, Wiltshire, on October 19 with a pre-sale estimate of £15,000.

Fateful journey: The Titanic leaves from Southampton on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. During the voyage, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank off Newfoundland

Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry 
Aldridge and Son, said: ‘This is the one and only document that exists 
today relating to the insurance for Titanic.

Claims for the Titanic totalled £16million - the equivalent of £1.7billion in today's money.

The life insurance policy payout to the wife of John Thayer, a prominent businessman from Philadelphia, who drowned in the disaster, was the largest of its time - at £31,000.

Strangely, his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on April 15, 1944.

William Carter, who survived, claimed £3,100 for his Renault vehicle that sank with the ship.

This became the first ever claim for a car damaged in a collision with an iceberg.

White Star Line paid out around £2.5million to Titanic claimants - £2.2million to British claimants and £400,000 to Americans.

However, people in the US originally filed claims totalling £10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out.

‘To
our knowledge, it is without equal as we have been unable to locate any
other such documents. It is an unremarkable piece of A4 paper but it 
holds the key to $5million.

‘Looking
back, the words “total loss” seem slightly prophetic, given just how 
soon after the policy was taken out that the ship was lost.

‘It is quite extraordinary that the owners of Titanic received the payout within a month of the disaster, barely after the funerals of the victims had taken place. Today that process would take months if not years.’

Those who either drowned or froze to death in the Titanic disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half-empty.

The crew of the ship had also failed to heed warnings of ice in the North Atlantic and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge iceberg.

Mr Aldridge said: ‘While the Titanic’s owners were swiftly recompensed, the families of victims who sued for negligence had to wait four years for compensation and even that that totalled $663,000.

‘If the disaster happened today the owners would very likely be charged with criminal manslaughter and have to pay out millions and millions of pounds in compensation.’

It shows cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sank in April 1912

Sea trials were due to take place in March but delayed for unknown reason

This could have been because doomed ship was not insured at that stage
