Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng has emerged as a prime target for Barcelona, according to Spanish newspaper Marca.

The Catalan giants are looking to strengthen their backline after failing with attempts to lure Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Silva to the Nou Camp.

The 25-year-old has reportedly been valued at £30million by Bayern, who will no doubt want to keep the World Cup winner.

Marca also report that an interest from Real Madrid is forcing Barca's hand in a move that could even by complete by the end of the week.

The Spanish press are also focusing in on the 'trouble between the sticks' at Real Madrid after the Galacticos acquired the signature of Costa Rica's World Cup hero Keylor Navas.

AS lead with Navas as he is quoted saying he has moved to Madrid 'to learn' seemingly not wanting to ruffle the feathers of current goalkeepers Diego Lopez and club legend Iker Casillas.

However, Marca look to add fuel to the fire as they claim Lopez 'refuses to go' with his place in the squad under threat.

Over in Italy, Tuttosport report that Juventus plan to build their team around midfielder star Arturo Vidal which could all but end Manchester United's pursuit of the Chilean.

Corriere dello Sport suggest that Juve are monitoring Javier Hernandez's situation at Old Trafford as they search for more firepower up front.
