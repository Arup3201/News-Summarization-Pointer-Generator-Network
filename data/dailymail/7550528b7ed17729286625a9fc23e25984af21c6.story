Company bosses are paid more than ever before, as the median pay package for a CEO rose to above $10million for the first time.

The salary for a CEO of a ‘typical’ large public company has increased 8.8 per cent year-on-year from 2012.

The median annual pay is now a record $10.5million, compared to $9.6million in 2012, a study has found.

Money, money, money: Nabors Industries' Anthony Petrello was the highest paid CEO in 2013 at $68.2million while CBS boss Leslie Moonves' pay rose 9 per cent to $65.6million, making him the second-highest paid

CEO pay has risen for the fourth year in a row, after a decline following the 2008 recession.

Since 2009, the median CEO pay package has climbed more than 50 per cent. A chief executive now makes about 257 times the average worker's salary, up sharply from 181 times in 2009.

A surge in stocks drove the Standard & Poor's 500 index up 30 per cent in 2013, which saw the stock component of pay packages rose 17 per cent to $4.5million.

‘Companies have been happy with their CEOs' performance and the stock market has provided a big boost,’ says Gary Hewitt, director of research at GMI Ratings, a corporate governance research firm.

‘But we are still dealing with a situation where CEO compensation has spun out of control and CEOs are being paid extraordinary levels for their work.’

The highest paid CEO was Anthony Petrello of oilfield-services company Nabors Industries, who made $68.3million in 2013.

Petrello's pay ballooned as a result of a $60million lump sum that the company paid him to buy out his old contract.

Nabors Industries did not respond to calls from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Petrello
 was one of a handful of chief executives who received a one-time boost 
in pay because boards of directors decided to re-negotiate CEO contracts
 under pressure from shareholders.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold CEO
 Richard Adkerson also received a one-time payment of $36.7 million to 
renegotiate his contract.

His total pay, $55.3million, made him the 
third-highest paid CEO last year.

The
 second-highest paid CEO among companies in the S&P 500 was Leslie 
Moonves of CBS.

Moonves' total compensation rose 9 per cent to $65.6million in 2013, a year when the company's stock rose nearly 70 per 
cent.

‘CBS's share 
appreciation was not only the highest among major media companies, it 
was near the top of the entire S&P 500,’ CBS said in a statement.

‘Mr. Moonves' compensation is reflective of his continued strong 
leadership.’

Men are in clear dominance both in terms of numbers of CEOs but also in terms of pay. On a list of the 50 highest paid CEOs, the first woman comes in at a measly number 33.

Carol Meyrowitz, head of off-price retailer firm TJX Companies, which includes TK Maxx, was paid $20.7 million in 2013, an increase of 9 per cent.

Media industry 
CEOs were, once again, paid handsomely.

Viacom's Philippe Dauman made 
$37.2million while Walt Disney's Robert Iger made $34.3million, while Time 
Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes earned $32.5million.

Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman made $37.2million in 2013, making him the fifth highest-paid CEO, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boss Leonard Schleifer in sixth at $36.3million

1. Rodney Sacks, Monster Beverage, $6.2 million, up 679 per cent

2. Stephen Kaufer, TripAdvisor, $39 million, up 510 per cent

3. Sandeep Mathrani, General Growth Properties, $22.1 million, up 424 per cent

4. Richard Adkerson, Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, $55.3 million, up 294 per cent

5. Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric, $19.2 million, up 264 per cent

1. Willard Oberton, Fastenal, $794,761, down 79 per cent

2. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, $485,606, down 77 per cent(asterisk)

3. Michael Duke, Wal-Mart, $5.6 million, down 73 per cent

4. John Richels, Devon Energy, $3.7 million, down 71 per cent

5. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, $653,165, down 67 per cent

The
 industry with the biggest pay bump was banking.  The median pay of a 
Wall Street CEO rose by 22 per cent last year, on top of a 22 per cent 
increase the year before.

BlackRock chief Larry Fink made the most, 
$22.9million. Kenneth Chenault of American Express ranked second with 
earnings of $21.7million.

Like
 stock compensation, performance cash bonuses jumped last year as a 
result of the surging stock market and higher corporate profits.

Boss woman: Carol Meyrowitz, head of off-price retailer firm TJX Companies, is the highest paid female CEO with $20.7million

Earnings per share of the S&P 500 rose 5.3 per cent in 2013, 
according to FactSet.

That resulted in an average cash bonus of $1.9 
million, a jump of 12.9 per cent from the prior year.

More
 than two-thirds of CEOs at S&P 500 companies received a raise last 
year, according to the study, because of the bigger profits 
and higher stock prices.

CEO
 pay remains a divisive issue in the U.S. Large investors and boards of 
directors argue that they need to offer big pay packages to attract 
talented men and women who can run multibillion-dollar businesses.

‘If
 you have a good CEO at a company, the wealth he might generate for 
shareholders could be in the billions,’ says Dan Mitchell, a senior 
fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

‘It might be 
worth paying these guys millions for doing this type of work.’

CEOs are still getting much bigger raises than the average U.S. worker.

The
 8.8 per cent increase in total pay that CEOs got last year dwarfed the 
average raise U.S. workers received.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said
 average weekly wages for U.S. workers rose 1.3 per cent in 2013.

At 
that rate an employee would have to work 257 years to make what a 
typical S&P 500 CEO makes in a year.

‘There's
 this unbalanced approach, where there's all this energy put into how to
 reward executives, but little energy being put into ensuring the rest 
of the workforce is engaged, productive and paid appropriately,’ says 
Richard Clayton, research director at Change to Win Investment Group, 
which works with labor union-affiliated pension funds.
