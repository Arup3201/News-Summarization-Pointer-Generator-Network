Guilty: Stephen Devesey, who has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years after killing his teenage girlfriend and hiding her body under his floorboards

A young father who suffocated his teenage girlfriend just weeks after she gave birth to their son has been jailed for life.

A jury at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday found Stephen Devesey, 21, guilty of murdering Nicole Cartmell in February last year, before hiding her body under the floorboards of their home.

Jailing Devesey for a minimum of 17 years, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told him: 'Your actions have destroyed a family who have lost a mother, a sister and a daughter. Your son will now have to come to terms with the actions of his father in the first few weeks of his life.'

As the unanimous verdict was read out, Nicole Cartmell's family were heard to say 'yes' and her mother Julie broke down in tears.

Devesey, who had pleaded not guilty, remained emotionless throughout the hearing.

The 21-year-old killer struck, suffocating his girlfriend with his arm, just minutes after she made a terrified 999 call on February 10 last year - desperately trying to leave his home.

After he murdered her, Devesey prised up the floorboards at his home in Handsworth, West Midlands and dropped her body onto a cellar floor.

Devesey then carried out an 'elaborate charade', telling lies to police and others in a bid to cover up the crime.

He changed his Facebook status a week after she went missing from 'engaged' to 'it’s complicated'.

He also texted Nicole’s mobile phone after she was reported missing on Valentine's Day, to appear concerned about her.

Devesey’s
 brother James told the court that he had stayed 
with his brother a number of times following Nicole's disappearance.

He
 testified that his brother had not answered the 
door to police who were looking for Nicole and that he had been with Stephen when he used Nicole’s 
bank card to withdraw £120.

Devesey was arrested on suspicion of murder after the body was found burried under floorboards

Giving evidence about the rotting smell James Devesey said he spoke to his brother about the odour.

He told the jury: 'I said jokingly that could be a dead body under the floorboards, he (Stephen) said "don’t joke about that".'

Devesey even made his brother burn incense to mask the smell when social workers visited the house.

The killer was initially arrested on suspicion of fraud after police found 
he had used Nicole’s cash card to withdraw money on several occasions.

When they searched his home they found her bag, purse and a green jacket she was wearing when she was last seen alive.

This led police to scour the rest of 
his home on March 2, and they discovered her body in the cellar, crudely
 covered by rubbish and old clothes.

Nicole had been missing since Valentine's Day the month before she was found

The court heard how Nicole had called police just days before her death.

A 999 call from a young woman was made from Devesey’s home on February 10.

A
 woman is overheard speaking to Devesey, telling him she would put the 
phone down if he opened the door of the property, which could only be 
opened with a key, to let her leave.

The call was terminated after the woman had asked the other person to open the door six times.

Prosecutors told the jury Devesey killed Nicole shortly after the call was made.

Sentencing Devesey to life with a minimum tariff of 17 years, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told him: 'You murdered Nicole Cartmell, a bright, beautiful, young woman who was still only 18.

'You did not want her to leave you so you made sure she did not.

'When she came to your house for the 
last time you knew she had to leave to get to her uncle’s birthday 
party, but you prevented her from leaving.

'The 999 call she placed was the last time anyone other than you heard her voice.

'She stood no chance from the moment you put your forearm around her throat.

'I am satisfied she may have collapsed at an early stage but it was not instantaneous, she must have suffered for some time.

'After you killed her you set about disposing of her lifeless body.

'You lifted the floorboards and covered her body with items such as curtains to hid it.

'When the smell became too bad you told your brother to light joss sticks.

'The only mitigating circumstance is your age, as you are still only 21 and I take that into account.

'I therefore sentence you to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 17 years.'

Speaking in a statement after the sentence Nicole’s heartbroken parents Julie and Gary Cartmell, from West Bromwich, West Mids, said they hoped Devesey’s conviction would 'haunt him forever and a day.'

They also revealed they would raise the baby boy Nicole gave birth to just weeks before her death.

They said: 'The Cartmell family would
 like to give our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in finally 
bringing our daughter Nicole’s murderer to justice.

'There are too many to mention but 
each and everyone have our eternal gratitude for their hard work, 
support and genuine care during this horrendous 18 months.

'The sentence will never be enough, it will never justify the loss of our beautiful daughter.

'Her precious baby boy has had his mother taken, an irreplaceable bond has been broken, it has broken our hearts.

'We hope this day will haunt Steven forever and a day.

'We want as a family now to be left 
alone to concentrate on trying to recover from this ordeal and to raise 
our grandson to be a happy, much loved and protected little boy.'
