France has seen a sharp rise in the number of people being hospitalised for alcohol-related conditions.

Around 400,000 people out of a population of 65 million are admitted to French hospitals every year for conditions like comas, hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, a rise of 30 per cent compared with three years ago.  

In addition, short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms are up by a staggering 80per cent.

Worrying trend: France has seen a 30 per cent rise in  the number of hospital admissions for conditions like comas, hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, in just three years

Despite being one of the world's key
 producers of wine and spirits, the French are often perceived to have a 
healthy attitude towards alcohol with most drinking done at mealtimes 
and rarely to excess.

According to the French Society for Alcohol abuse hospital admissions for drink related diseases , particularly amongst young people, are now twice as numerous as those for common complains like diabetes or cardio vascular disease.

‘We are seeing more and more young people arriving at accident and emergency clinics in drunken states who remain in hospital for one or two days to be sobered up.

We are also seeing young patients whose health is already seriously affected due to pancreas or liver diseases like cirrhosis which previously did not show  until much later in life’, said Dr Damien Labarrière, a specialist based in Orleans in a radio interview.

Professor Michel Reynaud, addiction 
specialist in the Paris area, co author of the report, added that young 
French women are turning more and more to binge drinking in order to 
show off to their friends.

‘It is particularly worrying that large numbers of young girls see getting drunk as a form of glory’ he said.

‘This
 is a health emergency. We have no longer government money to cope with 
this problem. When one considers the rising scale of it it is hard to 
see how it can be stopped’, he said.

Professor
 Reynaud blamed the ‘banalisation ‘of alcohol for the Gallic rise of 
binge-drinking and legalisation of Internet advertising for drink.

‘Social networks have democratised consumption of alcohol and proclaimed drunkeness as a status symbol’, he said.

‘Le Binge-drinking’ has now become a familiar expression in the French language and many blame the UK for its rise in France.

Hortense Dormoy a journalist for women’s magazine Marie-Claire described binge-drinking as consuming alcohol ‘over a short period of time to reach a drunken state and complete loss of control’ and ‘drinking six glasses or more for men and five or more for women’.

She claimed the phenomenon ‘originated from England where young people take advantage of “happy hours” to drink as much as possible in as short a time’.

The magazine revealed that 2.3 per cent of French  17-year-olds had recourse to bingeing at least ten times a month.

Paradoxically  alcohol consumption over the past 50 years has actually declined by 50 per cent  in the country which is the world’s number one tourist destination and produces champagne, cognac and some of the finest wines on the planet, alcohol in  France still remains a prolific serial killer due to ‘le binge-drinking’.

Figures for 2009 revealed this month  that drinking killed 49,000 people in France of whom 40 per cent were under the age of 65.

Short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms were up by a staggering 80per cent, Many French believe British culture is to blame for this worrying trend

36,500 of the French victims were men with alcohol accounting for 13 per cent of total male deaths and 12,500 were women representing 5 per cent of female deaths. 

The 13 per cent of total male deaths  due to alcohol abuse compares with 5 per cent in Switzerland , 3 per cent in Italy and 1 per cent in Denmark.

The 5per cent French female deaths due to drinking  are  also higher than Italy (2per cent) and Denmark (1per cent).

‘Alcohol is a major cause of premature death being responsible for 22 per cent of deaths in the 15 to 34 age group, 18 per cent between 35 and 64 and 7 per cent of people over 65. Deaths due alcohol are caused mainly by cancer and heart disease ‘, statistics  revealed. 

In France scientific tests on rats revealed that young rodents fed large doses of alcohol became twice as likely to become dependent on drink when they reached maturity.

Leading researcher Mickael Naassila revealed that ‘We noticed that the animals literally lost control of their alcohol intake and were able to consume between 5 and 6 grammes perkilo of their weight, which is a huge amount’.
