Nathan Walsh threatened to tell a married woman's husband about their affair and put naked pictures of her on the internet unless she gave him £1,000

A 22-year-old man threatened to tell a married woman's husband about their one-night stand and put naked pictures of her on the internet unless she gave him more than £1,000.

Nathan Walsh blackmailed his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, by text message for more than year, saying he would expose their affair unless she handed over the cash.

The traumatised woman made more than a dozen payments before she eventually went to the police.

Walsh, who fainted in the dock as he was sentenced, was jailed for three years. 

Walsh had sex with the woman after going for a drink with her in 2012 and kept explicit photographs of her, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.

He started sending her text messages a few days later, telling the woman he would put the images on the internet and tell her husband if she didn't give him money.

Prosecutor Timothy Harrington said the woman withdrew cash from her bank account amounting to about £1,100 and made a series of payments over 12 months before finally calling the police.

He said: 'That was money she could ill afford. The payments in total appear to be about a dozen.

'She found it difficult to deal with this, as has her husband. She feels they have lost trust between each other.'

Satvir Aujla, defending, said Walsh, who has no previous convictions, had been stupid, 'young and naive'. 

She said: 'He was too wrapped up with his own debt and the loss of his grandmother at that time.'

Walsh, from New Invention in the West Midlands, initially denied blackmail between July 2012 and September 2013 but pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial.

He fainted in the dock as he was sentenced to three years in jail.

Judge Martin Walsh said: 'This was a vicious and ugly offence and no doubt traumatised the complainant.

'This was an offence that persisted over a period of time with severe psychological trauma to the victim.'
