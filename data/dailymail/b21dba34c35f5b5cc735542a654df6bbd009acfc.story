This is the face of the mystery man at the centre of a murder probe after his naked body was washed up on a popular beach.

The bearded stranger was found wearing just his socks and a single walking shoe when he was discovered last Tuesday at Perranporth in Cornwall.

It was initially thought the man may have killed himself but Devon and Cornwall Police say he had multiple suspicious injuries.

Anonymous: This is an artist's impression of the mystery man at the centre of a murder probe after his naked body was washed up on a popular Cornwall beach

Mystery: A faded photo of a toddler that dates back to 1952 was found in a wallet lying near the body

A series of mysterious items were also found near the corpse, including a dark navy blue Regatta coat and a wallet containing a faded picture of a child. Police also found a set of keys consisting of a Citroen car key, two mortice lock keys, a hippopotamus key-ring and a red fob.

A date on the back of the picture reads 13 April 1952, but it is unclear what this refers to. Officers also found a woolly hat and a rucksack.

Detectives now hope this black and white artist's impression will lead to an identification for the man who was white, aged 50-70, of thin build and between 5ft 5ins and 5ft 7ins tall.

He had white receding hair, which was bald on top, and a thick white bushy beard.

Perranporth residents have likened his discovery to the ITV hit crime drama 'Broadchurch' and say their pretty coastal town is awash with sinister rumours.

Police believe the dead man had not been in the water for more than 24 hours and could have been pushed overboard from a boat.

Police attend the scene where a man's body was washed up on the beach at Perranporth, Cornwall. He was found dead on a beach naked with just one shoe and an old black and white photograph. The death is being treated as suspicious

Discovery: Devon and Cornwall Police found the hat on the same day as the body, but now believe it may have belonged to the unidentified victim

Bag: Officers investigating the death also found a black rucksack at the scene

The cause of death remains unclear but officers say his injuries could not have been caused by being flung against sand or rock.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorne of the Major Crime Investigation Team said: 'We believe the artist's impression is a true likeness of the man we are trying to identify.

'As you can see from the image he has some distinctive features including a bushy white beard and white receding hair.

The set of keys found near the body

The man was was reportedly completely naked apart from socks and one walking shoe. A day later a dark navy blue Regatta coat was found nearby

'It's been a week since his body was found on Perranporth Beach and his identity is still a mystery.

'By releasing this image we are hoping that someone will recognise him and come forward with his name, allowing us to progress with the investigation and bring us a step closer to finding out what has happened to him.

'He is someone's brother, father, uncle or friend and someone somewhere will be missing him.'

A police spokesman said the man’s fingerprints had been sent to Interpol.

Resident
 Joan Taylor, 72, said of the investigation: ‘Everyone is talking about 
it. It’s a small place and to find a murder victim on the beach and have
 police buzzing around is not an everyday thing.’
