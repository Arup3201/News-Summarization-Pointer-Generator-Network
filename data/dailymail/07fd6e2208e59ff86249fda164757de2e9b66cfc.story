The USS Zumwalt, the largest stealth destroyer ever built for the U.S. Navy, was launched into the waters of the Kennebec River in Maine for the first time on Monday.

The big ship touched water without fanfare after a ceremony scheduled was earlier this month was canceled due to the partial federal 
government shutdown.

Dozens of local residents gathered to 
watch the hours-long process of floating the ship in a dry dock. In the 
water for the first time, the ship was a sight to behold.

‘It's absolutely massive. It's higher 
than the tree line on the other side. It's an absolutely huge ship - 
very imposing. It's massively dominating the waterfront,’ said Amy Lent,
 executive director of the Maine Maritime Museum, who watched the 
process from her office down river from the shipyard.

‘The Zumwalt is really in a league of its
 own,’ said defense consultant Eric Wertheim, author of the ‘The Naval 
Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World.’

Workers at Bath Iron Works, part of General Dynamics, will continue working on the ship throughout the winter. The
 shipyard hopes to hold a rescheduled christening in the spring, with 
sea trials following in the fall. Bath Iron Works plans to deliver the 
ship to the Navy in 2015.

Originally envisioned as a ‘stealth destroyer,’ the Zumwalt has a low-slung appearance and angles that deflect radar. Its wave-piercing hull aims for a smoother ride.

The 610-foot ship is a behemoth that's longer and bigger than the current class of destroyers.

It was originally designed for shore bombardment and features a 155mm ‘Advanced Gun System’ that fires rocket-propelled warheads that have a range of nearly 100 miles. 

Thanks to computers and automation, it will have only about half the complement of sailors as the current generation of destroyers.

Critics, however, felt the Navy was trying to incorporate too much new technology - a new hull, computer automation, electric propulsion, new radar and new gun - into one package.

At one point, the program was nearly scrapped because of growing cost. Eventually, the program was truncated to three ships, the Zumwalt being the first.

With its fearsome array of weapons, 
radar evading silhouette and $7billion price tag, this is one of 
America's most deadly - and expensive - warships ever.

Equipped
 with guns capable of firing warheads 100 miles, stealth features, and 
engine able to generate enough power to run 78,000 homes, the U.S. Navy 
is hoping it with guarantee its naval supremacy for decades to come.

After embarrassing troubles with its latest class of surface warships, the Navy is hoping for a winner from a new destroyer that's ready to go into the water.

So far, construction of the 
first-in-class Zumwalt, is on time and on budget, something that's a 
rarity in new defense programs, officials said. 

The christening of the ship bearing the name of the late Admiral Elmo 'Bud' Zumwalt was canceled earlier this month because of the federal government shutdown.

The public christening ceremony featuring Zumwalt's two daughters will be rescheduled for the spring.

Admiral Zumwalt served in destroyers during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for valor at the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

As
 the nation's youngest chief of naval operations, appointed at age 49 by
 President Richard Nixon, he fought to end racial discrimination and 
allowed women to serve on ships for the first time.

Like its namesake, the ship is innovative.

It is so big that Bath Iron Works built a 106-foot-tall, $40 million 'Ultra Hall' to accommodate its large hull segments. The ship is 100 feet longer than the existing class of destroyers.

It features an unusual wave-piercing 
hull, electric drive propulsion, advanced sonar and guided missiles, and
 a new gun that fires rocket-propelled warheads as far as 100 miles.

Unlike warships with towering radar- and 
antenna-laden superstructures, the Zumwalt will ride low to the water to
 minimize its radar signature, making it stealthier than others.

Deadly force: Armed with up to 80 Tomahawk cruise missiles and designed to back up Marines on amphibious missions the USS Zumwalt is so expensive only three will be built

Resembling a 19th century ironclad warship the USS Zumwalt uses a 21st century version of a 'tumblehome' hull

Displacement: 14,564 long tons (14,798 t)

Length: 600 ft (180 m)

Beam: 80.7 ft (24.6 m)

Draft: 27.6 ft (8.4 m)

Propulsion: Two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent-30 gas turbines driving Curtiss-Wright generators and emergency diesel generators, 78 MW (105,000 shp); two propellers driven by electric motors

Speed: Over 30 kn (56 km/h; 35 mph)

Weapons:

20 × MK 57 VLS modules, with a total of 80 launch cells

RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), four per cell

Tactical Tomahawk, one per cell

Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC), one per cell

Two × 155 mm/62 caliber Advanced Gun System

920 × 155 mm rounds total; 600 in automated store with Auxiliary store room with up to 320 rounds (non-automatic) as of April 2005

70–100 LRLAP rounds planned as of 2005 of total

Two × Mk 110 57 mm gun (CIGS)

Originally envisioned for shore bombardment, the ship's size and power plant that can produce 78 megawatts of electricity - enough to power 78,000 homes - make it a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun, which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound.

There are so many computers and so 
much automation that it'll need fewer sailors, operating with a crew of 
158, nearly half the complement aboard the current generation of 
destroyers.

'The concept of 
the Zumwalt is sort of a bridge between the traditions of the past and 
the new world of networked warfare and precision guided munitions,' said
 Loren Thompson, defense analyst at the Lexington Institute.

'It's
 not so much a radical concept as it is an attempt to pull off a full 
range of missions with a ship that has one foot in the present and one 
foot in the future.'

The 
Navy once envisioned building more than 20 of the ships. But the ship 
has so many sophisticated features and its cost grew so high that senior
 Navy officials tried to kill the program. Instead, it was truncated to 
just three ships, the first being Zumwalt.

The Zumwalt will cost more than $3.5 billion - about three times that of current destroyers - but the program has not been beset by big cost overruns or delays, officials said.

The fact that construction has gone smoothly is a relief for the Navy, which has dealt with embarrassing troubles on its new class of speedy warship, dubbed the 'littoral combat ship.'

Those smaller ships, designed to operate close to shore in littoral waters, have been plagued by escalating costs, production delays and mechanical problems.

Mission modules that give them the 
flexibility to perform roles including anti-submarine warfare and 
minesweeping are not ready, even though the first ships have been 
commissioned.

'That ship is a total disaster,' said Norman Polmar, a naval historian, analyst and author.

Against
 that backdrop, shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works have been toiling away 
on the Zumwalt, the first entirely new ship built on the banks of the 
Kennebec River since the original Arleigh Burke was christened more than
 20 years ago.

Dan Dowling, president of Local S6, 
which represents 3,200 shipbuilders, said it's been a challenging 
project with a new hull design, composite materials and new technology.

'It
 is a radical departure from what we've known. Whether the Navy is 
satisfied with the design of the ship is up to them. We can only build 
what they asked for,' he said, adding, 'I hope they'll be pleased with 
it. We'd like to build as many of them as we can.'
