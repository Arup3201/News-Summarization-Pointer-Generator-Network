Euan Blair, who is to marry his girlfriend of eight years Suzanne Ashman next weekend, is secretly planning to  run for Parliament at the 2015 election, if the latest rumours around Westminster are to be believed.

On Saturday, Euan, 29, and Suzanne, 25, will have an autumn 
wedding at South Pavilion, the Grade I-listed house in Wotton Underwood 
bought by the Blairs for £4m in 2008.

And the former Prime Minister's eldest son is now being tipped to the join Jack Straw's son Will and John Prescott's son David by following in his father's footsteps to contest the Labour seat of Coventry North 
West.

Euan Blair, 29, is to marry his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Buckinghamshire on Saturday

Former Defence Secretary Bob 
Ainsworth, the current MP for Coventry North East has announced he is to
step down and there have been several signals that Euan is preparing to
take his place.

Last
year he quit his job with the American 
merchant bank Morgan Stanley to become a business development manager at the 
Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access, part of the government's Work 
Programme.

The Labour seat of Coventry North 
West, could also become vacant as current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015.

Euan
was also a quiet presence among the Labour canvassers successfully 
fighting the Corby by-election following the resignation of Louise 
Mensch.

According to a
Labour Party insider quoted in the Independent: 'He's ticking the right
boxes. Almost like the young Obama in Chicago.

'He
could have stayed [at the bank] and made a fortune. But moving to 
Coventry was his choice, not his father's. It's his choice.'

Wedding planners: Cherie and Tony Blair are understood to be planning a spectacular party for Euan and Suzanne

Former Prime Minister Tony and his wife 
Cherie are understood to be planning a spectacular party for the couple,
who bought a house together in Islington at the end of last year and 
got engaged over Christmas.

However
it is now rumoured to have become a bone of contention as Euan and 
Suzanne struggle to have some control of the proceedings, most importantly 
the guest list.

Miss Ashman herself is certainly no stranger to politics. She read 
PPE at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving St Paul's Girls' School in
London. 

She was introduced to Euan by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon who she was doing work experience for. She then went on to work for Tony Blair's Faith Foundation.

Miss
Ashman, who is now an analyst for Social Finance, which helps raise 
funds from private investors for good causes, gets on well with her 
future in-laws and has been on several holidays with them over the 
years.

Unlike Euan's, Miss 
Ashman's parents are divorced.  Her wealthy motor racing entrepreneur 
father John Ashman has married weathergirl (and former fiancee of Lembit
Opik) Sian Lloyd, and her mother is the daughter of a former Turkish 
government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara..

Family snap: Euan Blair, seen here on the far left in 2007, is the eldest of the Blairs' four children and first to marry

Euan is the eldest of the Blairs' 
four children, and the first of them to marry, but whether it will be a 
Roman Catholic wedding remains to be seen.

Euan,
like his younger brother Nicky, 27, was brought up Catholic and 
attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in west London before going
to Bristol.  His mother is a Catholic, and his father joined the 
Catholic Church in 2007.

Whatever the style of the wedding, the Blairs (whose fortune runs to some £60m) are expected to throw a good party.

In 2000, a then 16-year-old Euan was picked up by police after being found drunk and incapable in Leicester Square.

Mrs
Blair's colourful family are expected to be invited, including her 
Muslim convert sister Lauren, but there is doubt as to whether their 
frail father, actor Tony Booth, will be well enough to attend
