West Brom have announced the signing of defender Chris Baird on a one-year contract.

The versatile 32-year-old was available on a free transfer after the expiry of a short-term deal at newly-promoted Burnley.

The Northern Ireland international will become new manager Alan Irvine's third signing of the summer after Joleon Lescott and Craig Gardner.
