Horsemeat has been served to children in school meal cottage pies, it emerged yesterday.

It was also revealed that some hospitals have been serving patients burgers which contain horse passed off as beef.

And the Whitbread chain announced that burgers and lasagne served at its Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn hotels were contaminated.

Scandal: A UK lab testing beef products says that nine out of 15 samples in one batch contained horse, as well as lamb, chicken and pork in a scandal linked to abattoirs like this one in Romania

The spread of the food fraud scandal from supermarkets into the catering sector suggests the full scale of the contamination is still to emerge.

Yesterday, Lancashire County Council said that it has withdrawn pre-prepared cottage pies from 47 school kitchens.

It is understood the supplier involved, Oak Farm Foods in Ireland, has been supplying the ready meals for at least the past six months. There are also suggestions that the pies and other products made by Oak Farm have been supplied to schools and other outlets across the UK and Ireland.

Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment spokesman, said: ‘People will be shocked and dismayed that horsemeat has now been found in schools and hospitals.

‘David Cameron should order the FSA to speed up its testing so that we have a full picture of just how far this has spread in our communities.’

A Department for Education spokesman said, while there is no food safety risk, the discovery ‘represents a serious and unacceptable breach of trust’.

She added: ‘Suppliers and caterers should be urgently reassuring schools and parents about the action they are taking.’

Other local authorities from Staffordshire to Sheffield have removed processed beef from school meals as a precaution.

It was also revealed that burgers containing horsemeat have been supplied to hospitals in Northern Ireland.

A British burger and kebab factory opened by Prince Andrew was last night drawn into the horsemeat scandal

A British burger and kebab factory opened by Prince Andrew was last night drawn into the horsemeat scandal.

Paragon Quality Foods, based in Doncaster, was named as supplying tainted burgers to the Whitbread group.

Its website has a picture (above) of Prince Andrew, alongside the company’s Turkish-born owner Metin Pekin, opening an extension to the factory.

Yesterday, Paragon could not explain the presence of horse DNA, saying it ‘only buys beef from licensed and approved EU suppliers’. A spokesman said the firm supplies Whitbread with three burgers, with one testing positive for horsemeat.

Three British firms were involved in supplying horsemeat-contaminated lasagne to Whitbread. The meat came from Pinnacle Foods, of Hampshire, while the dishes were made by Creative Foods, of Flint, and delivered by Brakes.

A Pinnacle spokesman said: ‘As you can appreciate we are devastated by the news, and working very hard to trace back where the offending material may of come from.’

The FSA revealed yesterday that its officials raided the premises of two other English companies earlier this week as part of its investigation.

David Bingham, of the health service’s Business Services Organisation, which provides meat to health trusts, said a range from a company in the Republic of Ireland had been withdrawn.

A Whitbread spokesman said the chain was ‘shocked and disappointed’ to learn of the horsemeat contamination.

They said the chain had tested 30 products and found horse DNA in two, a meat lasagne and a beef burger.

Supermarket giant Asda announced it had 
withdrawn its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce, left, from sale after tests 
indicated the presence of horse DNA. Its 600g Beef Broth Soup, right, 
was also withdrawn as a precaution

Concerns: The supermarket chain also withdrew 
its 500g Meat Feast Pasta Sauce, left, as a precaution as well as the 
400g Chilli Con Carne Soup, right

They said they ‘will not be replaced until further testing has been undertaken and we are fully reassured of [their] integrity’.

The Food Standards Agency yesterday 
released the results of the first tranche of beef products tested for 
horse contamination, which revealed no cases beyond the seven already 
identified.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson 
welcomed the news, adding: ‘It’s wholly unacceptable that if people buy 
products marked beef, they turn out to be horsemeat.’

Oak Farm Foods was not available for comment last night.
