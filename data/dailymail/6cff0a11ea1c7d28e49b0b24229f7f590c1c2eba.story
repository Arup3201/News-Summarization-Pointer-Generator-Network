Nick Compton will always remember the moment he heard that his great friend Phillip Hughes had been seriously hurt doing what they both loved to do, batting.

'I just broke down for hours and hours,' said the man with perhaps an unlikely but very firm bond with the Australian. 'I really struggled. I just spent two days indoors. It was the immediacy of it that was such a shock. That you could lose someone you're really close to in an instant.

'My first instinct when Phil was struck was "I've got to get out there". And when he died I knew I had to go to the funeral. I had been organising flights to go and see my family in South Africa over Christmas when I heard about the accident so I just booked a flight to Sydney as well.'

What followed was a desperately painful but also uplifting experience for a man who credits Hughes with inspiring his own rise, from their days together as two young Sydney grade cricketers to opening the batting for their countries.

'It was a tragic and surreal experience but it also became very special,' said Compton. 'Seeing not only all the family and friends of Phil but also the Australian team and greats like Shane Warne, Steve Waugh and Brian Lara.

'It was a real celebration of Phil's life and I will always be thankful that I went. Driving up to Macksville from Sydney, walking around the town that he loved so much and getting a feel for the place.

'I was able to connect with everyone and appreciate just how much Phil meant to people. I went to his favourite Chinese restaurant with a group of his friends and we ordered his favourite dishes and shared our memories of him.

'The service itself was so emotional and moving. You meet people in life who you just click with and who touch you. We were such different characters in so many ways but that's how I was with Phil.

'It's funny. I thought I had something pretty unique with him but talking to people I realised there were at least 50 others who felt exactly the same as me about him and had the same relationship. That made me smile.'

Compton and Hughes were clearly something of an odd couple, proof that opposites can attract. The straightforward Australian country boy with an extravagant and unorthodox approach to batting and Compton — a deep thinker and accumulator of runs rather than an entertainer, different in style not only to his Aussie mate but also his legendary grandad Denis.

'It was when I went to play for Western Suburbs in 2008 that I met Phil,' said Compton. 'We struck up an immediate friendship and he had a big influence on me. He was a very confident character who played with no fear and had a really infectious personality.

'We kept in touch and then Phil lived with me when he came over to play at Middlesex the following year. He was always a great support to me. I was older but I really looked up to him. It was impossible not to be uplifted by Phil.'

Compton is adamant that his great friend would not want cricket to change in the wake of his tragic death following a bouncer delivered by Sean Abbott at the Sydney Cricket Ground that struck him on the back of the head and caused catastrophic brain damage. 'I can hear what Phil would say as if he was here in my front room now,' said Compton.

'He loved cricket, loved the team and loved talking about it. He would say it was a freak accident and he would want us all to get out there and keep on playing in the same way. I really hope the game doesn't change as a result.

'But it will change the way we all feel when we go into bat, I'm sure about that. As a batsman you always accept that you may get hit and hurt but I don't think any of us ever thought that we might get killed. We know we can now.

'I hope it brings cricketers closer together. That everyone will respect each other on the field and show more humility at times. Life can be very short. Phil was a big family man, the son of a banana farmer who spoke to his dad about four or five times a day. In the seven or eight days I spent in Sydney what struck me was how strong the traditional values he had were, a love of family life and going home whenever he could. I hope it makes us all realise what's important.'

For Compton that reminder was timely. He has had, by his own admission, '18 months of introspection' following his axing from the England team just as he was on the verge of fulfilling his childhood dream of playing in the Ashes. He had been given his chance as Alastair Cook's opening partner in India in 2012 as a reward for the prolific county career he was having after leaving Lord's for Somerset.

In nine Tests he scored two centuries but seemed to freeze when in sight of the big prize, scoring seven runs from 45 balls against New Zealand at Headingley in what proved to be his last Test innings to date. 

'Was I too intense in that innings? Well, you can read a lot into it but I'm sure every batsman is tense at times, even Sachin Tendulkar,' said Compton. 'Alastair was going very well at the other end and I didn't think I was batting too slowly at the time. He was smashing it while I was struggling for timing, but I didn't feel the need to have a hack. It was only afterwards that I realised I might have done things a bit differently.

'The selectors did what they thought was right and who am I to argue, but it was a massive blow to me to miss the Ashes. It's something you work towards and dream about.

'It was tough after I was dropped. I couldn't help thinking 'what now?' And perhaps I didn't do myself any favours by speaking out about it.

'I would love to play for England again and I certainly haven't given up but if I don't play again I can look back on some special memories.

'Hitting the winning runs in Mumbai, with my mum there, was amazing, as was scoring a century against New Zealand in Dunedin in front of my dad. Just being in the England side with so many great players was special.'

Compton will attempt to prove that, at 31, he still has time to play for England. He is again back at Lord's after a surprise return to Middlesex this month despite signing a new three-year deal with Somerset in 2013. 

'It was a tough decision, but it came about after a challenging time,' said Compton. 'Being closer to family and friends had something to do with it but also after losing my England place I had to think about what direction I wanted to go in.

'I'm returning to a club that's close to my heart and where it all started for me. Perhaps being back at Lord's might help me get back with England. I'm only just over 30 and I still feel young and at the peak of my powers. Somerset were very understanding and I will always be grateful for what they, and particularly (former director of cricket) Brian Rose, did for me.'

The decision was taken before Hughes' death but the sense of a fresh start seems all the more apt for Compton now. And perhaps a new approach to batting.

'I certainly hope to have him with me when I go out to bat again,' said Compton. 'And I think after the introspection of the last 18 months it might be time for me to have a bit of the Phil Hughes attitude.

'He was a fighter who took it to the opposition and I want to have some of that. I've never believed intensity was a bad thing but it can't affect everything. I think there's more to my game than has perhaps been seen by England and it's up to me to show positivity and allow myself the freedom to prove it.

'I want to reignite my game. And I want to do it Phil's way.'
