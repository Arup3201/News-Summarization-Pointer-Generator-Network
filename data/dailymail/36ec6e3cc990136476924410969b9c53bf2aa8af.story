Andy Carroll insists there is nothing to stop West Ham United challenging for the Barclays Premier League title this season.

The 25-year-old scored his first goals of the campaign on Sunday as his brace helped the Hammers record a 3-1 win over 10-man Swansea City and move up to third in the table for more than 24 hours, before Manchester United leapfrogged them.

Sam Allardyce's side remain in the top four after 15 games, having won eight of their opening fixtures, as Carroll struck twice and Diafra Sakho scored late to see off the Swans, who had taken the lead through Wilfried Bony.

Despite earning plenty of plaudits for their attacking approach, many expect West Ham to drop off the pace during the hectic winter schedule but Carroll believes they should now be considered contenders.

'I think there is no limit, we can go all the way to the top,' the England international replied when asked how high the Hammers can finish.

'We have a great squad and I can't say we are going to give up now we are in the top three, we have got a great team and we can go all the way.

'I think with the team we have got and the manager, the way he is playing and coaching everyone, it is fantastic and I don't think we will be giving up at all.'

Much was made leading into the clash with Swansea over the fact Allardyce had plumped to sign Carroll rather than Wilfried Bony in the summer of 2013.

The West Ham boss said his decision would prove right over time, despite the fact Carroll had scored only twice in the league ahead of the fixture.

Carroll has missed plenty of football through injury but has not felt the pressure to come back hitting the ground running with the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho performing well in attack in his absence.

'I've not seen anything about it. But he chose the right one didn't he?' Carroll replied when asked about Allardyce's comments.

'I have been out for a long time and the last couple of games I've been playing I haven't been fully fit.

'There have been a lot of injuries and I was put in unexpectedly really and played a couple of 90 minutes before I was fully fit. Now I'm feel good and strong and I can put myself about a bit more.

'It is always easier (to come back into the side) when you have got a big squad. You are not relying on one player; we have a big squad and all quality players that can come in.

'That is why the players who are not playing are disappointed and the players who are in are putting the performances in to not be left out.'

Swansea could have leapfrogged West Ham with a win at Upton Park but, having taken the lead, they slipped to defeat and have still only won once on the road this season.

Their task was made more difficult when goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was sent off with the Swans 2-1 down and, as manager Garry Monk suggested in his post-match press conference, the club have appealed against the decision.

Gerhard Tremmel came on the for the closing stages and was beaten by substitute Sakho in the closing stages but, if Fabianski's appeal falls on deaf ears, he is ready to step in heading into Christmas.

'West Ham has always been a tough place to come to; they try to push us high and we could not really find a way through,' he said.

'Today, we were 1-0 up, we had that advantage and we could not get anything out of it. That is quite disappointing, but it is just one game of many.

'When I saw Lukasz coming off his line I knew it was going to be very close for him to reach the ball. I'm always looking forward to playing for Swansea, and this will be no different.

'We have some important fixtures coming up. We need to get as many points as possible to sit comfortably in the table before the New Year. It is a very important phase for us and we want to get as much points as possible.'

Carroll adds a a genuine aerial threat, which can trigger panic among modern central defenders
