She was the beautiful German air hostess who won the heart of an American circus tycoon and married him just five weeks later.

Now some of the vintage clothes worn by Hannelore Nagel, the widow of Billy Smart Jr., are to go on sale in London in aid of the Alzheimer Society.

A treasure trove of 70's and 80's pieces, the collection includes crimson silk jumpsuits, Pretty Woman style skirt suits with oversized shoulders and several thigh-scraping Thierry Mugler dresses.

But gorgeous though the clothes are, Nagel's own rags-to-riches tale is arguably the more eye-catching.

At the beginning of 1973, Nagel, now 69, was an air hostess working for Pan Am on the London to Los Angeles route.

But a chance meeting with circus impresario and notorious lothario Billy Smart Jr. would change her life forever - just five weeks after meeting, the besotted pair were married.

The lavish wedding, held on a beach in the Mexican resort of Acapulco, was held in front of guests that included footballer George Best and catapulted Nagel into the world of the international jetset.

Her new husband Billy Smart was the tenth and youngest child of the legendary founder of the world famous Billy Smart Circus.

But despite his success, dry businessman he was not and during the 1960's, he set about wooing some of the era's biggest stars, with Jayne Mansfield, Shirley Bassey and Diana Dors among his conquests.

That all ended when he met Nagel, who, with her striking looks, fun-loving personality and fabulous figure, would remain at his side until his death in 2005.

With her new husband, the once air hostess travelled the world, mingling with everyone from film stars to royalty and building a reputation for her glamorous style.

Now the wardrobe she built up during that time is go under the hammer, with a feast of dramatic dresses, 80's power suits and glamorous Chanel ski gear - including the ski helmet itself - all set to be auctioned off.

Colourful: Brights were a favourite and she had this magenta dress (far right) dyed to match her Rolls Royce

Ticking off nearly every 70's, 80's and 90's trend imaginable, highlights include classic figure hugging pieces by Alaia, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler.

Other eye-catching pieces include the fruits of her  experiments with Westwood and Commes des Garcons and a 1983 Mugler dress dyed to match the magenta paintwork of her favourite Rolls Royce Corniche.

More still are by Chanel, Schiaparelli and Lacroix, and come in a rainbow of bright hues, with turquoise, crimson and pink clearly among Nagel's favourites.

Nagel might be selling off her wardrobe but as her extensive collection makes plain, she's without doubt still a fashion fan at heart.
