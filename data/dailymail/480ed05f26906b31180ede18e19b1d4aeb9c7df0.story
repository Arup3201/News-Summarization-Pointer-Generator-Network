OSCAR Pistorius shot through a car sunroof at  a traffic light after a  confrontation with police, his ex-girlfriend told his murder trial.

The Olympian was furious after an officer took his Glock pistol and emptied its chamber after the car – in which Pistorius was a passenger – was pulled over for speeding, the court heard.

Samantha Taylor, a model who was also a passenger in the car, said the police had spotted his gun lying on the car seat and told him it ‘couldn’t just stay there’.

Back in court: Oscar Pistorius checks his mobile phone in the dock before the start of the fifth day of trial

Stress: Pistorius reacts while listening to evidence about the night he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

Strain: The Paralympian covers his ears while studying his notes as he returned for what could be another day of harrowing testimony from witnesses about his girlfriend's death

Testimony: One of the athlete's former girlfriends told the court how he carried a gun with him 'all the time' when they were dating

She added: ‘Oscar got angry.  He shouted at the policeman because he was not allowed to touch his gun.’

After
 the confrontation with officers was over, the car pulled away and 
Pistorius re-loaded  the weapon, letting off a shot through the sunroof 
around 15 minutes later.

The
 driver of the car was Darren Fresco – the friend pressured by Pistorius
 to take the blame in another shooting incident that was relayed to the 
court earlier in the week.

Miss
 Taylor told Pretoria High Court that the double amputee carried a gun 
‘all the time’ during their relationship, which began when she was 17.

He kept one under his bed and on the floor with his prosthetic legs at night, she added.

Tough to hear: The athlete's ex-girlfriend painted a picture of him as an unfaithful boyfriend who was prone to fits of anger and went everywhere with his gun

Range of emotions: The sprinter was forced to listen to intimate details about his past relationships in court

Laid bare: Miss Taylor described some of Pistorius's habits while they were dating, including what side of the bed he always slept on at home and where he kept his gun during the night

Strain: Miss Taylor's observations of what Pistorius did when they were together show different traits from what the Olympic athlete says he did on a later night when he shot Miss Steenkamp

Miss
 Taylor painted a picture of a man who was frequently angry, raised his 
voice, kept multiple mobile phones and was unfaithful.

The
 witness wept repeatedly as she described their turbulent romance, which
 began in 2011 and ‘ended when he cheated on me with Reeva Steenkamp’ – 
the girlfriend he is alleged to have shot on Valentine’s Day last year.

Her
 evidence about the shooting incident in the car relates to firearm 
offences that Pistorius has denied, which are in addition to the murder 
charge he is facing.

Miss 
Taylor described another incident in which Pistorius had brandished a 
gun to threaten the driver of a car that he believed was following them 
home.

‘When we arrived 
at his estate, he jumped out of the car with his gun and held it to 
someone’s window and then they drove away,’ she said.

Listening to testimony: The athlete - known as Blade Runner - sits in the dock with his family behind him

Greeting: Pistorius shakes hands with a member of the African national congress women's league in court

Emotional: The Paralympian's sister Aimee (front centre) shows the strain that the trial is taking

Support: Blade Runner's sister Aimee (left) and uncle Arnold (right) sit with other relatives in the public gallery

During
 cross examination, the double amputee’s lawyer, Barry Roux, put it to 
Miss Taylor that Pistorius could sound like a woman when he raised his 
voice in anxiety.

She 
disagreed and told the court that she had heard the athlete shout at her
 ‘sister, best friend, another friend, and his best friend’ and ‘he 
never sounded like a woman’.

The
 fifth day of the trial also heard testimony from a security guard who 
had received reports of gunshots coming from Pistorius’s house and had 
phoned the athlete, only to  be told that ‘everything is fine’.

Pieter
 Baba, who had greeted Miss Steenkamp, 29, at the gate of Pistorius’s 
exclusive estate only hours before her death, had got through to the 
athlete on his mobile phone.

‘Mr
 Pistorius said to me “security, everything is fine”,’ Mr Baba told the 
court. ‘That’s when I realised that Mr Pistorius was crying,’ he added.

Discussions: The sprinter shows his sister Aimee something on his mobile phone in the courtroom in Pretoria

Tensions: Unidentified friends of Reeva Steenkamps's family appear to glare at Pistorius during the trial

Scene shot: A TV monitor shows a picture of the street where Oscar Pistorius lives

Embrace: Pistorius hugs his sister Aimee, who has been in court every day this week

Conferring: The 27-year-old Olympian talks with his uncle Arnold in the courtroom

Done for the weekend: Pistorius leaves court at the end of the fifth day of his trial which has adjourned until next week

Many by now will know Oscar Pistorius's tough-talking lawyer Barry Roux who has been tearing into witnesses in a bid to discredit their stories.

But a lesser-known member of his legal team is 24-year-old Roxanne Adams who has been assisting Mr Roux build the case for the defence.

She has been sitting in front of the Paralympian throughout the trial and is sometimes seen deliberating with Pistorius as he leans over the dock.

Currently a candidate attorney for a South African law firm, she certainly has aspirations of filling Mr Roux's shoes one day if her Twitter account is anything to go by.

Her page is full of motivational phrases such as: 'Do everything with passion, push yourself to your absolute limits and you will succeed in everything you do.' 

Another post says: 'Believe in urself & have faith in ur abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in ur own powers u cannot be successful or happy.'

The
 athlete then called back Mr Baba, who told the court: ‘He just started 
crying over the phone. That’s when the line went off again.’

The guard then drove to Pistorius’ house and saw him coming down the staircase with his mortally-wounded girlfriend in his arms

‘I saw Mr Pistorius coming down with Reeva. My lady, I was so shocked that I couldn’t even think for a few moments,’ he said.

‘I got such a fright seeing Oscar carrying Reeva down, after he had told me everything was fine.’

Earlier in the day, Dr Johan Stipp, a radiologist who was one of the first people on the scene, finished giving his testimony.

In
 spite of repeated challenges from Mr Roux, he stuck to his story that 
he had heard screaming and shots on the night and saw lights that were 
on in the Pistorius house.

Pistorius
 claimed in his statement that he had been too frightened to put on the 
lights on the night he shot his girlfriend dead, believing she was an 
intruder. 

Mr Stipp 
said that the second volley of sounds he heard could not have been a 
cricket bat striking a door, as Mr Roux has suggested, as the succession
 of the bangs was too rapid for that.

The case continues.
