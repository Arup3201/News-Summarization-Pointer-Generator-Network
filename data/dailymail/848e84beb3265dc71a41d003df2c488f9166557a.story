Cambridge University students are renowned for their intelligence so you would think they'd have more sense than to emulate Kim Kardashian.

But that's exactly what 12 undergraduates have done by volunteering to take part in a competition called 'Cambridge's Best Bums'.

One of the entrants uses Kim Kardashian as his muse as he replicates her infamous Paper cover by wearing long black gloves, a pearl necklace and little else.

The six male and six female contestants are vying for the title of 'Cambridge's Best Bum' with their cheeky shots. 

Each candidate appears on the student newspaper The Tab website which encourages their peers to vote on their favourite bottom. 

The 12 finalists were chosen by The Tab Cambridge editorial team from a pool of entries. 

Those in the running include Katie - who reads English at Sidney Sussex - who appears posing on the roof of her college dressed in just blue stockings.

Modest: Maths student Vivienne kept her pants on

Another girl called Lauren, who is reading History of Art at Pembroke, is pictured next to the river gazing at the iconic King's College chapel. 

Each photo is accompanied by a tongue-in-the-cheek comment playing up to their brainy reputation such as: 'Lauren supports the hypothesis that Goya was indeed a necrophiliac, and that the eroticism of his mutilated muse has been significantly understated in all recent scholarship – or indeed in any scholarship.'

Organisers said all the entrants had 'volunteered' their services and both male and female students were participating in the same competition.

While reality star Kim has put bottoms firmly in the spotlight recently, the Cambridge students can actually lay claim to starting the trend.

This is the third time they have run their controversial competition - which has received opposition from women's groups and has been forced to change its name.

It was originally dubbed 'Rear of the Year', but had to change the title last year after being contacted by the annual competition who claimed they had stolen their name.

Previous winners of the official Rear of the Year, first awarded in 1976, include singers Rachel Stevens and Charlotte Church and BBC's Fiona Bruce.

This year's winners were singer Olly Murs and TV presenter Carol Vorderman who won the gong for the second time.

The University of Cambridge declined to comment on the 'best bums' competition.
