Kyle Walker has undergone lower abdominal surgery after missing Tottenham's pre-season preparations, the club have confirmed.

The England right back has been out for five months with the problem, which ruled him out of the World Cup in Brazil.

The club report that further medical assessment by specialists prompted him to go under the knife.

Young star: Walker had been ruled out for five months with the injury and missed the World Cup with England

The north London club had initially hoped to avoid surgery, but resorted to sending the player for an operation in a bid to fix the long-standing problem.

'Kyle is good some days. On other days he has a bad feeling,' boss Mauricio Pochettino said last month.

'We believe he may recover soon, but we need to be calm with him because it is an injury that he has had for five months.'
