A baby girl born with a 'back-to-front heart' endured two major operations to keep her alive, the first when she was just three hours old.

Chloe Bennett was diagnosed with the congenital heart defect, while still in the womb.

At her 20-week scan, her mother Stephanie Bennett was told her baby was suffering transposition of the great arteries (TGA).

The potentially life-threatening illness means the major blood vessels in the heart are wired the wrong way, stopping the circulation of oxygen around the body.

Baby Chloe Bennett was born with a congenital heart defect known as transposition of the great arteries. The condition means the major blood vessels are wired incorrectly, stopping the circulation of oxygen around the body

At just three hours old Chloe was taken into theatre for her first operation, where doctors inserted a balloon into her heart, helping her to breath. Her mother Stephanie Bennett, right, was told at her 20-week scan that her unborn daughter was suffering the heart defect, and would need major surgery

The 37-year-old was warned her unborn baby's only chance of survival would be surgery, and that she would struggle to breathe once out of the womb.

Three hours after she was born, Chloe was taken into theatre for her first operation, designed to keep her breathing.

Sixteen days later the newborn endured surgery once more, as surgeons worked to rewire her heart.

Mrs Bennett and her husband Charlie, were finally allowed to take their new daughter home seven days after her major open heart surgery, despite warnings she could be in hospital for a month.

Mrs Bennett, said: 'I can’t believe we are finally home after everything she has been through.

'At my 20-week scan I found out something was wrong with my baby’s heart.

'They said her heart was wired the wrong way and she wouldn’t be able to breathe on her own when she was born.

'I was so scared for her. In her first 16 days she had four general anesthetics and two major surgeries.

'But just one week after her open heart surgery, I was told I could take her home.

'It’s amazing when you see how well she is doing now, apart from the scar, you would never know what she has been through.'

Three hours after Chloe was born on May 30, she underwent her first life-saving surgery, a balloon septostomy, under general anesthetic.

Chloe's parents Stephanie and Charlie, then had to wait for 16 days until surgeons were ready to perform the second, life-saving operation on Chloe, rewiring her heart

Mrs Bennett, said: 'At my 20-week scan I found out something was wrong with my baby's heart. I was so scared for her. In her first 16 days she had four general anesthetics and two major surgeries'

The mother-of-four, said: 'I only saw her for a number of seconds before she was whisked away from me.

'While I was having a blood transfusion, Chloe had her first surgery. Charlie didn’t know who to be with he was running between us both.

'They put a tube up through her belly button and inflated a balloon in her heart before removing it.

'This makes a hole through her heart which allowed her oxygen and blood to mix to keep her alive until her major surgery.'

The family then faced a difficult 16 days waiting for Chloe to have her life-saving operation.

Mrs Bennett, said: 'She had all sorts of tubes going into her body and down her throat.

'She was on a drip too to keep her blood and oxygen mixing to keep her alive.

'At one point I counted she had 45 holes in her body all at once.

'Because she was so small, her tiny veins collapsed a lot and so she had to have a cannula going into her head.

'She contracted necrotizing enterocolitis infection too so that put off her surgery date twice.'

When Chloe was cleared of the potentially life-threatening infection, a third date was set but doctors warned her parents she might not make it.

Mrs Bennett, said: 'Two days before it came Chloe looked terribly ill.

'Her oxygen levels had drastically dropped. I was so worried for her.

Just seven days after her second operation, baby Chloe was allowed home to her parents and three older siblings, including sister Lola, pictured

Doctors had warned the family that Chloe could be in hospital for up to three weeks after her second operation

She has got a massive scar... But apart from that, you would never be able to tell everything she has been through'

'The doctors knew they couldn’t leave her any longer for her surgery so the next day she had to have it. I was petrified.'

On June 15, Chloe was put under general anesthetic to have her heart rewired.

Her mother said: 'It was the longest day of my life. It was so scary waiting for her to come out of it.

'Her heart is so tiny it’s amazing how they can operate on something so intricate and no bigger than a small strawberry.

'But the surgeons were amazing and they managed to replug her. And my little Chloe was so tough she pulled through.

'After 48 hours I got to hold her in my arms again.'

The family had been warned Chloe would have to stay in hospital for up to three weeks, while she recovered.

But just seven days after her open heart surgery, doctors were told she was well enough to go home.

Mrs Bennett, said: 'Even adults normally have to stay in hospital for weeks after this type of surgery but amazingly Chloe was strong enough to come home after just seven days.

'It was the best news ever. Now she is doing really well and her brothers and sister love having her around.

'Her stitches have all dissolved now but she has got a massive scar down the size of my index finger.

'But apart from that, you would never be able to tell everything she has been through.

'She never complains and is always smiling, she is the happiest baby.'
