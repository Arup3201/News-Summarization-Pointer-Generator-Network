Shocking video footage has emerged of the moment a man was paralysed from the waist down after he was kicked through the top window of a double-decker bus in London.

CCTV footage of the incident was captured by a camera on a bus immediately behind the double-decker the man fell from near Finsbury Park, north London.

The victim's sister has now said her brother was paralysed following the fall, in which he is understood to have broken his back.

This is the shocking moment a man was kicked through the top window of a double-decker bus in London

The footage, taken on Seven Sisters Road on December 27, 2012, was shown on BBC Two's The Route Masters: Running London's Roads on Sunday.

Footage meanwhile taken from inside the bus captured the moment the victim was kicked in the midriff before he fell out of the window.

The man's sister, identified as Gillian, told the programme: 'At the moment they can't pinpoint a time on his recovery due to the fact that his back was so badly broken and his spinal chord was damaged. He needs to recover from his broken back before we even know if he's able to walk again.

'He's paralysed basically - he can't feel his legs, which is a life-changing experience. It's obviously going to be a bit hard for him.'

Detective Constable Tony Barun, a specialist safer transport command officer for the Met, told the programme: 'It's still shocking. Although we see violence every day, it's our bread and butter, it's still shocking to see something as graphic and violent as this.

'We know these windows can be kicked out with a great deal of effort, but to see someone kicked so hard that he actually goes through the window and it pops the window out of its frame - I've never seen that before.'

Police have said the man was left paralysed from the waist down following the incident in December 2012

A Metropolitan Police spokesman has told MailOnline the suspect jumped through the broken window before making off.

The spokesman said: 'The victim was seriously injured and is now paralysed from the waist down.'

On
 January 16, 2013, a 38-year-old man was arrested and charged with GBH 
with intent. He was later acquitted at Wood Green Crown Court on August 
19, 2013.

The driver of the bus told the programme how he was alerted to the incident before he saw the man lying on the street.

The man's sister, identified as Gillian, said her brother's back had been broken in the incident

He said: 'He was trying to get up but couldn't. He had spinal injuries. Then after a little while he started coughing up blood. Luckily there was a nurse passing by so she stayed with him.'

According to official figures, more than 20,000 crimes were reported on London's buses in 2013.

A special unit within the Metropolitan Police is funded by Transport for London in an attempt to cut rates.
