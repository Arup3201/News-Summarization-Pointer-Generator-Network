Scientists could be on the brink of developing a cure for blindness, after regrowing corneas in the laboratory.

The team behind the study at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Institute in the U.S. believe the milestone could help reverse a leading cause of blindness.

A major breakthrough in stem cell research allowed researchers to grow the first known tissue from an adult stem cell.

The scientists say their work offers hope to burn victims, victims of chemical injury and people with damaging eye diseases.

Scientists at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Research Institute in the U.S believe they have made a breakthrough, regrowing corneas in a study which could pave the way for a cure for blindness

They have identified a way to enhance 
regrowth of human corneal tissue to restore vision, using a molecule 
known as ABCB5, which acts as a marker for hard-to-find limbal stem 
cells.

The research, published in the journal Nature, is also one of the first known examples of constructing a tissue from an adult-derived human stem cell.

Limbal stem cells are found in the eye’s basal limbal epithelium, or limbus, and help maintain and regenerate corneal tissue.

Their loss due to injury or disease is one of the leading causes of blindness. 

Previously, tissue or cell transplants have been used to help the cornea regenerate.

But until now it was not known whether there were actual limbal stem cells in the grafts and outcomes were not consistent.

In the new study, researchers were able to use antibodies detecting ABCB5, to pinpoint the stem cells in tissue from dead human donors and use them to regrow anatomically correct, fully functional human corneas in mice.

The study’s co-lead author Doctor Bruce Ksander, who worked alongside Dr Paraskevi Kolovou, said: 'Limbal stem cells are very rare, and successful transplants are dependent on these rare cells.

'This finding will now make it much easier to restore the corneal surface. It’s a very good example of basic research moving quickly to a translational application.'

Co-author Dr Markus Frank said: 'ABCB5 allows limbal stem cells to survive, protecting them from apoptosis [programmed cell death].'

Dr Natasha Frank added: 'The mouse model allowed us for the first time to understand the role of ABCB5 in normal development, and should be very important to the stem cell field in general.

'A single lab cannot do a study like this.

'It integrates genetics, knockout mice, antibodies, transplantation - a lot of technical expertise that we were lucky came together in a very nice way.'
