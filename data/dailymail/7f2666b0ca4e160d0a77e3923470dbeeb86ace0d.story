A father who has been taking his children to school in a wheelbarrow attached to a bicycle told road safety police he 'knew what he was doing' when stopped at rush hour this morning.

Ben Watson said he had been taking daughters to school on the bike for four years and thought the operation launched by Metropolitan police was 'unfair' on cyclists.

Hundreds of officers were deployed to London's most dangerous junctions and roads today in a bid to monitor road safety after the deaths of six cyclists in just two weeks.

Ben Watson, 57, was stopped by police for taking his two daughters to school in this 'wheelbarrow bike'

Mr Watson, who has taken hischildren to school in the bike for years, was stopped on Euston Road, London

Mr Watson said the Met police's road safety operation was 'unfair' on cyclists this morning

Mr Watson was pulled off the road by police this morning near Euston Junction, but was later released.

The 57-year-old criticised the officer in question for not knowing the law, saying: 'This policeman called me over and said "is that bike legal?" I thought "well you’re the policeman surely you should be telling me whether its legal or not"'. 

The house husband from Somers Town added: 'I think it seems a bit unfair as this operation is making out cyclists are the problem when it is actually cars that are the problem.

'I know my lights, I know where I’m going.

'I’ve been taking the kids to school on this route for four years, I know what I’m doing.'

600 police were deployed across London this morning in a crackdown on road safety following the deaths of six cyclists in just two weeks

Police stopped over 70 lorries at 60 of London's most dangerous junctions this morning following a joint decision by the police and County Hall to take further action on securing the safety of cyclists

Six cyclists have been killed in collisions on London roads in just two weeks, prompting police to lay down a 'zero tolerance' policy for dangerous driving.

The Mayor's cycling commissioner told the Evening Standard last week: 'This is a new zero-tolerance approach with a police officer on every main road in central London from Monday which is a huge escalation to the checks we are doing already.

'They will be stopping lorries and cars and where there is unsafe driving they will be taken off the road.

'We will also target unsafe cyclists.

'It is a short-term measure but the Mayor and the police feel we must act as a result of the recent spate of appalling accidents.'

Police were on the lookout for motorists using mobile phones, drivers stopping in 'bike boxes' at traffic lights and cyclists riding on the inside of HGVs at 60 sites across London today.

Officers stopped over 70 lorries and handed out 15 safety notices in the crackdown which was arranged by Metropolitan Police Service and City Hall last week.

Over 100 cyclists were also stopped and given safety advice. A total of 14 have died in the capital in road accidents this year.

The Mayor of London was accused of shirking his responsibility by urging cyclists to 'think of the laws of the road' last week.

Boris Johnson said the 'hasty, rash decisions' of those who cycle on busy roads were 'endangering their lives'.
