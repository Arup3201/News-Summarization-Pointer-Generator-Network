Danny Sherwood, 31, was given two 12-month suspended prison sentences at Bournemouth Crown Court months after he was jailed for a similar crime

A 'predatory' roofer who repeatedly swindled pensioners out of thousands of pounds could strike again after he avoided jail for his latest con, officials have warned.

Danny Sherwood, 31, told a disabled 60-year-old she needed £90 of work done to her roof but ended up charging her a whopping £5,680.

He was  handed two 12-month suspended prison sentences at Bournemouth Crown Court just months after he was jailed for a similar crime.

Sherwood pleaded guilty to misleading commercial practice in his dealings with Christine Coales, who suffers with ME, fibromyalgia and arthritis.

The serial offender has already served nine months in prison for overcharging a 73-year-old woman £2,150 for £630 of work in 2012.

He even drove her to a cashpoint to withdraw the money.

In 2011, he also admitted engaging in a misleading commercial practice after informing an 86-year-old Ferndown woman that her roof needed £700 of work done. 

Andy Sherriff, manager of Bournemouth council's Trading Standards unit, said: 'Danny Sherwood's behaviour is contemptible. As the court saw, he aims to exploit the elderly and vulnerable and, when caught, shows no true remorse. 

'Regrettably, it seems that spells in custody provide little deterrent. It doesn't look as though he's learnt his lesson.

'However, we have a team of officers who have worked hard to gather evidence and take this matter to court, and we continue do our best to protect all our local residents.

'The fact we repeatedly put Sherwood and his like in front of the courts should demonstrate that we are determined to pursue fraudsters and confidence tricksters. People should be allowed to feel confident in their own homes.'

In his latest scam Sherwood convinced Coales she needed minor repair work on her roof, but then proceeded to remove the whole roof.

Prosecutor Duncan Milne said Sherwood's move to replace the whole roof was 'entirely unnecessary and unjustified' according to an independent surveyor.

Recorder Gordon Bebb QC said Daniel Sherwood, who has two previous convictions for similar offences, showed 'predatory behaviour' and 'took advantage' of the 60-year-old. 

He ordered him to pay £1,900 compensation to Mrs Coales and £1,000 towards costs. 

Sherwood was found guilty of seven counts of fraud at Bournemouth Crown Court in April after needlessly removing a chimney at the vulnerable pensioner’s home in Rossmore in September 2012.

Margaret Williamson and Alan Read spoke of their shame at being conned by Kevin Sherwood

He was also found guilty of charging £2,150 for roofing work worth just £630 and of engaging in an aggressive practice in driving her to the cash point. 

Sherwood comes from a family of rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset - his brother and father have also both been convicted of ripping off elderly customers 

His father Kevin Sherwood was sentenced to 12 months in prison and given an ASBO in January 2013 stopping him from taking advantage of pensioners.

Alan Read and his partner Margaret, 82 said they were duped into handing £7,000 to Kevin Sherwood who needlessly replaced their roof. 

Sherwood Snr committed his crimes in September 2011 - five months after his son Kevin Jr tried to trick a vulnerable pensioner out of thousands of pounds after convincing him his garage roof was dangerous.

He turned up at his victim's house one morning and offered to fix some tiles which had mysteriously fallen off in return for £50.

Eventually, he charged the elderly man £3,700 for the straightforward work.

He was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service.
