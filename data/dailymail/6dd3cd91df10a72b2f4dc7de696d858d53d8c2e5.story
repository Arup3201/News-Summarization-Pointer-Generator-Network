The employees of Silicon Valley's top tech firms are among the most liberal in the country with about 70 percent of workers donating entirely to Democratic candidates.

Twitter has the most liberal employee universe, Apple Inc. and Google are tied, with 90 percent of their employees' giving going to liberal politicians. Yahoo, LinkedIn, Amazon.com and Facebook all had employees who gave more than 85 percent of their donations to liberals. 

The new data from Crowdpac, a for-profit company that analyzes political giving, will come as unwelcome news to the Republican party who are desperate to appeal to a younger, more liberal following.

Indeed, the GOP has long spoken of the need to do a better job when it comes to attracting workers from some of the most influential and powerful companies around including Facebook, Twitter, eBay and Amazon.

The data was compiled by Crowdpac co-founder Adam Bonica, an assistant professor of political science at Stanford University.

For four years a data base of more than 100 million political contributions made between 1979 and 2012 in local, state and federal elections was analyzed.

The results list of all the donations from employees of major Silicon Valley tech companies and show a huge skew to the left with  an overwhelming preference in for liberal politicians.

Crowdpac data explains why Republicans find the environment so challenging and why it is so hard to recruit talent from Silicon Valley to work on their campaigns.

In the liberal Bay Area around San Francisco it is Democrats who are most often elected into congress, but Republicans will have to find ways of appealing to this growing sector if they are to compete and harness some of the free-flowing capital.
