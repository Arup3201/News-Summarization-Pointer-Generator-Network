Grieving families of fallen troops will receive compensation despite the government shutdown, president Obama assured as he signed the benefits guarantee into law today.

Relatives of soldiers lost in battle since closing of federal government on October 1st were outraged when Pentagon suspended the roughly $100,000 payments.

Obama signed the bill securing the payments into law after it won final passage in the Senate earlier on Thursday.

Pentagon promises: President Barack Obama signed a bill securing payments to families of fallen troops during the government shutdown

Among those relieved are the families of Sergeant Patrick Hawkins, 25, Private First Class Cody Patterson, 24, Lieutenant. Jennifer Moreno, 25, and Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24, who all died from an explosive device this past weekend, and the families of 25 other active-duty service members who lost their lives during the 11 days of the shutdown.

Initially the familes were told that there would be no 'death benefits' payments, typically $100,000 paid out within three days of a service member's death. while the federal government was on ice.

The new bill reinstates benefits for surviving family members, including funeral and burial expenses, and death gratuity payments.

However Obama's chief spokesman, Jay 
Carney, had said the measure was unnecessary because a military charity 
had stepped in to continue the payments.

Sad sight: Pfc. Cody Patterson's body was brought back to the United States after being killed in Afghanistan on October 6, when his family was told the benefits payout was at risk

Respect: The Pentagon has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was at Dover Air Force Base when Patterson's body arrived

The Pentagon had said the lapse in 
funding meant it had no authority to continue the payments, but that 
explanation that did not sit well with members of Congress in either 
party.

The Pentagon 
said a law allowing members of the military to be paid during the 
shutdown did not cover the death benefit payments. Congress passed and 
Obama signed that measure into law before the shutdown began, and 
lawmakers insisted the benefits shouldn't have been affected.

The
House voted unanimously on Wednesday for a resolution that would ensure
that death benefits to families of fallen troops will be disbursed 
during the government shutdown.

In
stepped the Fisher House Foundation, which Defense Secretary Chuck 
Hagel said Wednesday would cover the costs during the shutdown.

Hagel said the Pentagon would reimburse the foundation after the 
shutdown ends. The government could not actively solicit funds from 
private organizations but could accept an offer.

The
administration said Thursday night that the Pentagon's agreement with 
Fisher House would remain intact to make sure the benefits are delivered
without further interruption until officials can get the program up and
running again.

The bill is the second ‘piecemeal’ measure Obama has signed to hold the military harmless during the shutdown. At the same time, the White House has threatened vetoes of other ‘piecemeal’ measures passed by the Republican-controlled House to continue funding for certain government operations. The White House has said the House should reopen the entire government and not choose to fund some agencies and programs over others.

Obama also supports House-passed legislation to provide back pay for thousands of federal workers forced off the job because of the shutdown.

Across the Capitol, Republicans on a House Armed Services panel excoriated Pentagon comptroller Robert Hale, accusing him of playing politics with his interpretation of the original law. They said the law was designed to pay the death benefits as well as keep all Defense Department civilians on the job — not to select the most essential.

‘You went out of your way to make this as ugly as possible, to inflict as much pain as possible on this department,’ said Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., who introduced the first bill days before the shutdown in an attempt to exempt the military.

Hale responded that the law was poorly written and there never should have been a shutdown in the first place.

‘I resent your remarks,’ the budget chief said. ‘I acted on the advice of attorneys and our best reading of a loosely worded law.’
