Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that he is confident that 'social stability' can be preserved in Hong Kong and insisted that Beijing won't change its 'one country, two systems' approach to running the territory.

Li met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday as thousands of protesters arrived for a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong - reviving the ongoing civil disobedience movement.

Li said that preserving the 'long-term prosperity and stability' of Hong Kong is not just in China's interest but in that of the residents of the former British colony.

Speaking through an interpreter, he said the territory's government will protect inhabitants from 'injury or material damage.'

Merkel said she hopes demonstrations remain peaceful.

His announcement came as thousands of protesters flooded a main road in Hong Kong for a pro-democracy rally late Friday. 

The renewed support revived the civil disobedience movement a day after the government called off talks with student leaders.

The resurgence came after a week that saw flagging support for the protests, which have blocked off main roads and streets in three of Hong Kong's busiest areas for the last two weeks. 

Some of the roads have reopened to traffic, but a main thoroughfare through the heart of the business district remains occupied.

Meanwhile, Taiwan's President used the country's National Day celebrations to urge mainland China to embrace democracy, starting with Hong Kong.

President Ma Ying-jeou said Taiwan gave 'strong support' for the people of Hong Kong's struggle for the democratic election of their local government. 

Drawing on an ancient Chinese proverb, the Taiwanese leader and Kuomintang Party (KMT) chairman said China's 1.3 billion people 'wish to enjoy greater democracy and rule of law.' 

Pointedly, he said 'such a desire has never been a monopoly of the West, but is the right of all humankind.'

He also suggested that Beijing should approach political reform today in the way it embraced early economic reforms three decades ago. 

China and Taiwan have been ruled by rival governments since 1949 when China's Civil War ended.

Students and activists gathered on the streets of Hong Kong are demanding a greater say in choosing the city's leader have vowed to stay until the government responds.

The government has repeatedly urged protesters to withdraw from the streets and allow the city to return to normal.

When the government cancelled the talks, it said grounds for dialogue had been 'severely undermined' by the students' call for more people to occupy streets.

Student leaders say it was up to the government to resolve the crisis.

Alex Chow, from the Federation of Students, one of the groups involved in the demonstration said: 'If they do not give a just, reasonable answer to all the occupiers, there is no reason to persuade people to retreat.'

Crowds gathering in the city's Admiralty district, near the city's government headquarters, chanted 'Our Hong Kong, Ours to Save.'   

Deadlock: Yesterday, Hong Kong government officials called off planned talks to negotiate with protesters while student groups organising the resistance insist that it is their responsibility to resolve the stalemate

Connected: A young pro-democracy protester  does his homework on a table set up in the middle of one of Hong Kong's busiest thoroughfares. One schoolgirl said they were willing to 'stay for a year' if they needed to

Many of those in the main protest zone were young people, including secondary school pupils in uniforms, but there were also office workers who came straight from work.

One schoolgirl, Natalie Or, said: 'We don't want to see a government that treats people this way, where thousands can protest for weeks on the street and not get any response at all.

She added: 'Maybe they think if they keep delaying people will disperse on their own, but my friends and I aren't going anywhere. I'll come for months, I'll stay for a year, I'll stay for as long as it takes.' 

Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017.  

Waning: The renewed support on Friday night comes after a week which saw the city regain some normality - with civil servants returning to work at the city's schools reopening

Beijing said a 1,200-member committee stacked with pro-government elites should nominate two or three leadership candidates before the public votes. 

Protesters say this gives them no real choice and do not amount to genuine democracy. 

Earlier this week, student demonstrators said they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but the government has since cancelled any talks. 

The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Beijing since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 

The protesters are also demanding the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, but he has refused to step down.
