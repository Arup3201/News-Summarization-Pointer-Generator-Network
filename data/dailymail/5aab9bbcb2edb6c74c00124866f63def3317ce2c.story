The great British public has voted Hull the the least romantic destination in the UK, while the capital city takes the number one spot as the most romantic destination.

Nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation chose London as the top location to take a loved one this year, ahead of the Lake District which slipped to second place with 15 per cent of the vote.

Taking the crown for most romantic destination, London, beat last year's reigning champion, the Lake District, and other popular locations including Cornwall, the Cotswolds and Edinburgh which also featured in the top 10. 

London 1, Hull nil: Hull has been voted the UK's least romantic place in a new survey by Hotels.com

The annual Destination Romance Report from Hotels.com reveals that   while London takes the top spot as most romantic UK city, it also comes in third place in the 'least romantic' list.

Both the Scottish and Welsh capitals also featured in the top 10 with Edinburgh in fourth place and Cardiff in ninth place. 

At the other end of the scale Hull was voted by a fifth (19 per cent) of Brits to be the least romantic destination in 2015, rising three spaces from its third position in last year's report and knocking last year's champion, Slough - which no longer features in this year's list at all - from the top spot.

Second placed: Traditional favourite the Lake District is knocked off the top spot by London this year

Birmingham came in second for the second year in a row with 11 per cent of the vote, while both London and the ballroom capital Blackpool  came in at joint third place.

It seems the capital divides opinion, with 18 per cent declaring it the most romantic destination, while 7 per cent send it into the list of the least romantic hotspots. 

Other new entries in this year's least romantic report included Leicester, Glasgow and Coventry who all featured in fifth place with 4 per cent of the nation's vote.

'With numerous new cities now featuring in both our lists, it is clear that those who previously held the top spot are working hard to prove they can be romantic too,' said Caroline Annand of Hotels.com. 

'Last year's number one least romantic city, Slough, has been able to avoid the top ten list altogether this year - other locations need to show that romance can be found in the most unlikely of places as well.'
