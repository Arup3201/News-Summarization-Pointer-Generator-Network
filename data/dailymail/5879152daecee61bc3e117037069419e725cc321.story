A £1billion raid on pensions will hit tens of thousands of middle and high-income earners, experts warned last night.

George Osborne yesterday announced he was cutting the tax-free amount an individual can put into their pension each year from £50,000 to £40,000.

It comes just a year after the annual limit was cut from £255,000.

Autumn statement: Chancellor George Osborne delivers his Autumn budget in the Commons and cut the tax relief for rich pensioners

The tax-free cap on lifetime pension 
pots will also be reduced from £1.5million to £1.25million. The 
Chancellor suggested the changes would largely affect only those at the 
very top of the income scale.

But experts warned that many middle income earners could be affected if they are in final salary pension schemes.

However the main impact will be on those earning higher incomes, particularly in the public sector.

Sources suggested the change could 
affect the top five per cent of public sector earners – including senior
civil servants, top doctors, leading police officers and head teachers.

The Treasury said 160,000 a year 
would be caught by the decision to cap annual tax relief at £40,000. 
Some 340,000 workers will be affected by the lifetime allowance to £1.25
million. The pensions raid was drawn up as an alternative to the Lib 
Dems’ mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million.

Mr Osborne said: ‘I know these tax 
measures will not be welcomed by all – ways to reduce the deficit never 
are. But we must show we’re all in this together.’

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the
National Association of Pension Funds, said many on middle incomes 
could be hit with tax bills running into thousands of pounds if they got
a significant promotion.

She added: ‘The Chancellor is wrong to say that the changes will only affect those at the top of the wage tree.

Complaint: George Osborne and Danny Alexander leave the Treasury building on Whitehall yesterday but their decision to cut tax benefits for pensions have been panned by some

‘Osborne claims he is taking a carrot
away from the rich, but he is also beating many middle class savers 
with a stick. Middle managers in the public and private sectors will get
caught in the net.

‘People in a final salary pension who
have worked loyally for the same employer for years and then get a pay 
rise, or a promotion, could end up with a tax bill of several thousand 
pounds.’

The self-employed and those nearing 
retirement desperately trying to ‘catch up’ by boosting their pension 
are also at risk. ‘What we desperately need is stability, so that people
can trust the pensions system and get on with saving for their old age,
instead of being treated like a cashpoint when things go wrong,’ she 
said.

But Ros Altmann, director-general of 
Saga, said it was reasonable to trim the pension tax allowances of the 
better-off. ‘It is understandable that the Chancellor has chosen to 
limit the amount spent on top earners’ pensions tax relief,’ she said.

‘Tax relief is meant to be an 
incentive to help people save for retirement, but it is hugely expensive
and it provides the most incentive to the people who need it least. The
highest earners get the highest incentives.’ Mr Osborne said the 
average pension saver put in £6,000 a year, with just one per cent 
putting away more than £40,000.

An individual saving for a defined 
contribution scheme in the private sector would have to be earning well 
over £200,000 to be affected.

Successful small business owners, workers with generous final salary schemes and the very wealthiest will be hit by the raid on pensions.

They will either be caught out by a lower cap on how much tax relief they can get on their pension contributions, or by a limit on the amount they can save up in a retirement fund.

Yesterday, George Osborne announced the annual tax allowance for pension contributions will be cut from £50,000 to £40,000 from 2014. The lifetime limit will be lowered from £1.5million to £1.25million. For the vast majority, paying these sorts of sums into a pension pot is unimaginable.

A 30-year-old, getting healthy annual pay rises and benefiting from a good return on his or her investment, would have to pay in 40p of every £1 earned every year for 35 years to get close to the £1.25million limit, according to  insurers Standard Life.

Even someone in a very generous final salary scheme, with 40 years’ continuous service, who retired on £97,500 a year, would only just bust the cap.

The Government estimates that just 30,000 people would have more than £1.25million in their pension pots in 2014. 

But around 330,000 of current working age could be affected in the future. These are all likely to be senior staff in companies or the public sector, with good final salary schemes to which they have contributed for years.

It is the annual allowance which will catch out more workers. Typically, small business owners don’t pay into a pension during their working years, instead preferring to make a large lump sum when they sell their company. 

Head teachers, police chiefs, senior nurses, middle-ranking civil servants and private sector managers on around £50,000, who are in final salary schemes and get a 10 per cent pay rise could also bust the cap and face a tax charge on the excess.

The raid on pensions may be morally acceptable but the Chancellor must, once and for all, make up his mind how he wants to treat tax relief on pensions so workers know what to expect in retirement. 

The message that this Government keeps reinforcing is that savers’ nest eggs are fair game when it comes to getting the economy back on track.
