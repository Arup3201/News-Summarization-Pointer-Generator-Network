Jurgen Klopp insists he is a better manager now than he was two years ago when Borussia Dortmund last won the Bundesliga.

The charismatic boss sees no reason to stand down despite Dortmund sitting bottom of the league and remains confident he can turn their fortunes around this season.

Klopp, 46, has been tipped as Arsene Wenger's replacement at Arsenal and has admitted he would be open to job offers from the Premier League.

Klopp has been linked with a move away from Borussia Dortmund, possibly to Arsenal in the Premier League

But despite the pressure he is currently under, Klopp sees no reason for a chance of job anytime soon.

'I'm not one for quitting. I am all or nothing,' he said. 'As long as Dortmund wants that, I will continue in that way.

'I'm a fighter and I'm a better coach than in 2012, although you cannot see that in the table.'

Dortmund have collected just 11 points from their 13 league matches so far and dropped to the bottom following Sunday's 2-0 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Some of the travelling fans started whistling at the team's poor performance but Klopp has called for unity.

He said: 'I totally understand the criticism. That is human. The whistles I understand. They are completely normal.

'However, anyone who whistles has to question whether it helps. Nevertheless, the situation does not feel catastrophic to me.'

He then joked: 'If you want to succeed, a person only has one option: to be a Bayern fan.'

Klopp has every right to ask for patience having enjoyed considerable success at Dortmund, winning the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 before guiding them to the final of the Champions League in 2013.

Their next must-win match is against Hoffenheim at the Signal Iduna Park on Friday night.
