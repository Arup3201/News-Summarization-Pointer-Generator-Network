'Inappropriate': Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Philip Hampton has turned down a £1.4million bonus payout, it emerged today

RBS chief-executive Stephen Hester is under further pressure to turn down his near £1million bonus today after his own chairman rejected a payout.

Sir Philip Hampton was in line to receive 5.17million shares - worth £1.4million - from the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

But he turned the payment down as he thinks it is 'inappropriate' to accept the windfall that he was to receive later this year.

An RBS spokesman said: 'Sir Philip Hampton will not receive the 5.17 million shares he was awarded in 2009 when he joined RBS.'

Mr Hester will now come under further pressure to follow suit and waive his payout.

His 
£963,000 payout has caused national outrage as the state-owned bank 
has missed lending targets, laid off 3,500 staff and seen its share 
price plunge 40 per cent.

David Cameron said today that it was for Mr Hester to decide whether he should accept the payment.

Sir Philip is believed to have taken his decision to reject the payment some time ago.

He was in line to receive the shares as part of a deal negotiated by Lord Davies, a Labour peer, who was in line to take the job.

When Lord Davies turned the post down, Sir Philip was given the post on the same package.

David Cameron warned today installing
a new top team at failed bank RBS could be even 'more expensive' than 
it is now as the furore of Stephen Hester's bonus continued.

But the Prime Minister insisted it was up to the chief executive to decide whether to give up his £1 million bonus.

'It's a matter for him,' he said.

'It's obviously his decision. My 
decision is to make sure the team at RBS get on with the job of turning 
the bank round and we made our views very clear on the bonus and that's 
why it was cut in half compared to last year.'

Mr Cameron was speaking at Chequers 
as news emerged that RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton had decided to 
waive his £1.4m shares bonus.

Mr Cameron added: 'I think we need to get the facts straight.

'The fact is Stephen Hester was 
brought in by the last Government, a contract signed by the last 
Government to turn round RBS - a bank that had got itself into a 
complete mess.

'The Government has made its views known and that is why his bonus was cut in half compared to last year.

'But we do have to bear in mind that 
the alternatives to what's happening now could be even more expensive if
you had a whole new team coming into RBS.'

Whitehall
sources said Mr Hester, who is on a basic salary of £1.2million, should
hand back the 'immoral' bonus as a gesture of good faith.

Mr Hester may gain a further £400,000 if - as analysts expect - the 3.6million RBS shares that form his bonus rise in value.

By close of trading last night, they were worth £998,000 - a rise of £35,000 in one day.

Nick
Clegg said he shared the public's dismay and urged Mr Hester to copy 
Antonio Horta-Osorio, of Lloyds, the other state-owned bank, in forgoing
his bonus.

Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of a 'disgraceful failure of leadership' for failing to block Mr Hester's payment.

'He's been promising for months action against excessive bonuses, 
executive pay, and now he's nodded through a million-pound bonus,' said 
the Labour leader.

'He must now explain, not least to the British people, why he has allowed this to happen.'

Rattled
by the public outcry, Number 10 and the Treasury sought to shift the 
blame to the RBS board, saying it was being managed at 'arm's length' by
UK Financial Investments, the agency in charge of public banking 
assets.

Asked if Mr Cameron was 'relaxed' about the bonus payment a Number 10 spokesman replied: 'No.'

A
senior government official told the Mail: 'Of course we'd like to see 
him to give it up as a gesture of good faith but we have done what we 
can.

'We can't tell 
him to do that. He has done a good job and put the bank back on track 
but that means those shares are likely to climb again in future. If the 
share price bounces back... I hate to think of the stink that will 
cause.'

RBS has been criticised for failing to hit targets for lending to hard-pressed businesses.
