Luton Town want free agent striker Andrew Johnson following his departure from Crystal Palace.  

The former England international left the Eagles earlier this week after managing just one appearance during his second spell in south-east London.

However, League Two Luton are keen to snap up the 33-year-old to boost their options in attack for the second half of the season. 

Andy Johnson is on the radar of League Two outfit after leaving Crystal Palace

Johnson had previously scored 85 goals in over 150 games for Palace before joining Everton for £8.5million in 2006. 

Speaking after his exit, the former QPR and Fulham frontman said: 'It was great to be back at Palace, if only for a short time, and I wish everyone at the club and those great supporters every success for the rest of the season.'

A Palace statement said: 'We would like to thank Andrew for his efforts during his return to the club and wish him all the best for the future.' 

Johnson, 33, has been hampered by injury problems over the past couple of years
