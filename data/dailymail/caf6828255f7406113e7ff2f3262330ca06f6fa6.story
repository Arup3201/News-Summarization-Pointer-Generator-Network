One McDonald's fan did not have a very Happy Meal after he became stuck in a baby high chair.

The customer needed to be rescued by police when he could not free himself from his uncomfortable seat this week.

Three officers were pictured helping the stricken man as he sat in the restaurant in Cork, Ireland.

The image, taken by a fellow diner, has now become an internet hit since it was posted online.

More than 4,500 people have seen the picture on Imgur and it has attracted hundreds of comments.

The picture was taken on Tuesday evening after the man, who has not been identified, popped in for a bite to eat.

He chose the child's high chair, rather than numerous adult-sized seats that were vacant at the time.

Police were then called when he realised he could not free himself from the chair.

According to the person who took the picture, the man had drunk some alcohol before squeezing himself in to the seat.

A McDonald's spokesperson said high-chairs should not be used 'without adult supervision'

He was released without charge after being freed.

A McDonald’s spokesperson, who was quoted in The Metro, said: ‘McDonald’s is aware of the incident involving a customer who decided to sit in one of our children’s high-chairs in Winthrop Street.

‘As you can see, we recommend that children don’t use the high-chair without adult supervision.'
