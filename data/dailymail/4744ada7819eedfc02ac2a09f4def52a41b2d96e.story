A shade of YSL lipstick is virtually no longer available after viewers of a hit Korean TV show believed it was the one worn by the lead actress.

According to The Korea Herald, fans of the fantasy romance, My Love From Another Star, 'mistakenly heard' that the female protagonist, Jeon Ji-Hyun, wore YSL's Rouge Pur Couture No 52.

Now the coral color is no longer available on dozens of cosmetics websites and there is an 'unspecified' waitlist on YSL's own e-store. On eBay sticks of the $35 lippy are currently going for up to $95 - and that's with 29 days still left on the clock.

Confusion: A global shortage of YSL lipstick has come about after viewers of the hit Korean TV show, My Love From Another Star, mistakenly thought the lead actress, Jeon Ji-Hyun, used it

Elle Australia reported that one 
shopper at Melbourne airport tried to buy 52 tubes of the rouge but walked away empty-handed.

And during Fashion Weeks in Europe earlier this year editors were hunting high and low for the YSL hue but had no joy.

A representative for the Paris-head quartered cosmetics brand confirmed to NYmag.com that the 
sellout is as a result of My Love From Another Star.

Phones have apparently been ringing off the hook with customers trying to identify the shade 32-year-old Ms Ji-hyan wears on screen.

The Korea Herald notes that the 
problem is Ms Ji-hyun 'did not actually use YSL lipstick' and it was a 
rumor that 'spread like wildfire online'.

Flying off the shelves: Now the coral color is no longer available on dozens of cosmetics websites and there is an 'unspecified' waitlist on YSL's own e-store

An industry source told the publication: 'The color of her lips [during the show] cannot be produced by a single product.

'The make-up artist mixed a number of different [products], and YSL was not one of them.'

Ms Ji-hyan reportedly used products made by AmorePacific, Korea’s largest beauty company, which was an official sponsor of My Love from The Star, not YSL.

The Korean TV series, which aired from December 2013 to February 2014, tells the story of an alien who landed on Earth 400 years ago and then falls in love with a top actress in the modern era.

The Wall Street Journal reveals that it has been one of the most-watched TV series on two of the online video platforms where it’s available, iqiyi.com and LeTV.com - on iqiyi.com alone, it has been watched 14.5billion times since its debut.

Along with lipstick, Ms Ji-hyan helped boost the sales of fashion, accessories and even food after endorsing them on the small screen.
