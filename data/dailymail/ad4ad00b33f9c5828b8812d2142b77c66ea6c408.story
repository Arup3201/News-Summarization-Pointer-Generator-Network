These French MPs clearly had their minds on other things when they were caught playing Scrabble during a debate about a gay marriage bill.

The socialist MPs were captured playing the game on iPads during a night session in the National Assembly to debate the bill.

It is unclear whether the pictures were taken during a break in the proceedings or while the debate itself was under way.

Among the words used during the game was 'gache', which is French for 'wasted', 
and 'mufle' which can be translated as 'cad, 'muzzle', or 'oaf'.

Elsewhere the ten-point 'z' letter was used in 'saluez', the French word for 'greet', and 'nez', which means 'nose' in English.

The National Assembly has approved a key article of the bill that would legalise gay marriage.

The measure, approved by a 249-to-97 vote, would drop the legal requirement that a marriage in France must be between two people of the opposite sex.

To become law, that measure must now be approved by France's Senate. That is expected to happen since President Francois Hollande favours the change.

However, the legislation also contains a measure that has been more controversial in the parliamentary debate, which started last Tuesday. It would legalise gay adoption, and hundreds of thousands of supporters and opponents of the measure have held protests in Paris.

The parliamentary debate on the gay rights legislation is scheduled to be completed by February 12.
