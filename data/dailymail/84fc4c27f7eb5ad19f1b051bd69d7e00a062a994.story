A beloved St Louis musician has fallen 18 feet to his death down an elevator shaft in a tragic accident.

Bob Reuter, a longtime fixture on the local music scene, was moving into a loft on Saturday afternoon when he stepped into the dark elevator shaft, assuming the elevator was there.

But it wasn't and he plunged to the ground, leaving three friends who had been helping him move in shock at the top.

The accident happened shortly before 2 p.m., in the apartment at 1129 St Charles Street, said St. Louis Fire Capt. David Neighbors.

The elevator had a swing door to enter rather than automatic doors that only open when the elevator has arrived. It had no kind of safety grill.

'It does appear to be a tragic accident,' Neighbors told Fox News. 'The access to the door was open and the individual was able to step in and felt the elevator was there and in fact it was not.'

He said Reuter fell 18 feet from the lobby entrance to a freight elevator landing in the basement at the bottom of the shaft.

Firefighters found the elevator car positioned well above the first floor.

The Missouri Department of Public Safety oversees inspections of elevators and, according to Riverfronttimes.com, online records show the one Reuter fell down had no operating certificate listed and was installed nearly 100 years ago, in 1918.

St Louis officials told local media that the building was inspected in May and problems with emergency-exit signage and lights were flagged, however the building addressed those problems.

The elevator in question was locked and out of commission, building inspectors noted at the time. Since then it was obviously reopened.

St Louis, Reuter's longtime home, is reeling after the horrific loss of the 61-year-old who was also a talented photographer and had a slot on KDHX (88.1FM) called 'Bob's Scratchy Records.'

Reuter had most recently been playing with new band, Alley Ghost, but in the past has collaborated with scores of artists including Wilco's Jeff Tweedy.

'I consider this an irreplaceable loss for the St. Louis music community,' said longtime friend and record store owner Tom Ray.

Another friend, Alley Ghost co-founder and guitarist, Matt Wilson said: 'Bob was such a prolific artist. His mediums were vast, and he inspired me on a lot of different levels.'

Chris Baricevic of Big Muddy Records was named by Reuter as executor of his will. He is planning a service to honor the musician's work and life on September 8 and is raising funds to pay for it. Any extra donations will go to a fund created in Reuter's name to support disadvantaged artists.

'Words fail at this moment,' Baricevic wrote in a statement. 'But please know that in these trying times, the best is brought out in the world. Let's stay positive. Let's focus on the important things - the beauty that was put into the world by a man and his work.'
