He wrote about burying enemy soldiers, sending letters to loved ones and his experiences on the front line.

Now, the diary of a First World War soldier has been brought to life in a series of Tweets.

Private George Kellett, from Yorkshire, penned the book during his service as a trench builder in France in 1918.

Commemoration: Now, 100 years on, the late soldier's life has been brought to life through a series of Tweets

Despite rarely speaking about his wartime experience, his relatives kept the diary and an archive of family photos.

Now, 100 years on, the late soldier's life has been commemorated through the social-networking site, Twitter.

And the site's 140-character limit suits Pte Kellett's style perfectly - with the servicemen favouring succinct diary entries.

One entry reads: 'Went out burying dead Germans and dead horses', while another states: 'Brought in two wounded Jerrys.'

One comment on February 4, 1918, speaks of when he first received the diary - reading: 'I received a parcel from home today with this book enclosed, also a Christmas cake and parkin and a few apples.'

Meanwhile, several entries refer to Pte Kellet's experiences at a convalescent camp after he is believed to have been gassed by the Germans.

One reads: 'Got to the con camp this morning. Gave in our pay books so that we can be paid tomorrow.'

Loved one: Pte Kellett (right) speaks of writing letters to loved ones, including his then-girlfriend, Emma (left)

And another says: 'Had a good tea and concert in the ward tonight. Had a big convoy in today.'

The
 soldier also speaks of playing draughts during his six-week stay at the
 military hospital, sending letters to his then-girlfriend Emma, and the snowy weather on the front line.

Pte Kellet, who died almost 50 years ago, served with the 10th (Service) Battalion, the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, which fought on the Western Front between July 1915 and 1918.Â 

Today, his great niece, Katharine Luford, 71, described the soldier as 'an average Tommy'.

'His diary entries are a reflection of the sort of person he was,' said Ms Luford, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire.

'He kept himself to himself.
 With that generation of men, most of them kept it inside. The diary 
records faithfully, but not emotionally, the day to day life. He gets on with it, doing his duty.

'For some reason we felt we could not just throw the diary away. My mother felt it was important to keep the archives and we felt it was important too.'

Ms Luford and her brother Steven, 68, donated the diary to Wakefield Museum, which is handling Private Kellett's Twitter account and has put the diary and photos on display.

Museum curator John Whitaker said: 'There are a lot of routine details which are peppered with horror.

'He has been sitting in a convalescent camp on the edge of France, playing a lot of draughts.

'He occasionally mentions friends in the camp getting their papers to return to the Front. It is quite an honest diary and it is matter of fact.'

Researcher Virginia Arrowsmith, based near Thirsk, added: 'It has been a remarkable project to get involved in and, for me, what has been really special is tracing one man's story through two years of the war.

Serving his country: Pte Kellett, pictured with friends, fought on the Western Front during the First World War

Handy: Pte Kellett describes how he made a table for the officers mess, before playing billiards in the yard

Serving his country: In this entry, he reveals the tough nature of his job - saying '[I] had to stand to all night'

'This included some of the key British offensives, a hospital ward and convalescent camp, across three countries and culminating with his being part of the 2nd Division which went into Germany after the Armistice was signed.

'His story gives a personal perspective on an international conflict

'I am delighted that George's descendants are working with us to piece together his story and I hope that this research helps them to build a clearer picture of his war experience and contribution to the conflict.'
