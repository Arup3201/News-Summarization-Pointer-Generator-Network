A white suburban Detroit homeowner who shot dead a black 19-year-old girl on his front porch admitted to purposefully opening fire on her out of fear, but insisted that he was not aiming at her.

Theodore Wafer, 55, is accused of shooting Renisha McBride in the face through a screen door in Dearborn Heights when she came looking for help after an early morning accident last November.

Taking the stand in his racially charged second-degree murder trial, Wafer said he ‘shot in fear’ when he saw a figure coming to his door. When asked by a prosecutor if he had shot 'on purpose,' he said, ‘Yes,’ but added he did not take aim.

Courtroom confession: Theodor Wafer, pictured on the stand Monday, testified Tuesday that he fired his gun at Renisha McBride, 19, on purpose because he was afraid

He also testified under cross-examination that he regretted not finding his phone and calling police before using his firearm – shotgun he purchased in 2008 to protect his property amid rising crime rates.

Wafer wept during his testimony Monday, saying he regretted killing the unarmed McBride but that the violent knocking on his front and side doors made him think someone was trying to break into his house.

The airport maintenance worker faces up to life in prison, if convicted.

Mr Wafer has testified that he couldn't find his cell phone to call 911, and went to the door with his shotgun.

He had told police the shooting was an accident, and testified that he pulled the trigger as a ‘reflex reaction.’

Prosecutors have called Wafer's actions unjustified and unreasonable.

‘Shoot first and ask questions later, right?’ Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Athina Siringas asked Wafer.

Wafer responded, ‘It was a threat that was coming into my house.’

During aggressive cross examination, Siringas questioned Wafer’s assertion that he was scared for his life – something he had failed to mention to police until they asked him about it.  

‘I had a lot of emotions, fear, panicking,’ Wafer said. ‘I guess in front of a cop I didn't want to come across as less of a man.’

Siringas later asked Wafer if his first reaction to seeing a young African-American female was to shoot but his defense attorney objected before he could respond.

The killing of McBride has sparked protests in Dearborn Heights and comparisons to the 2012 Florida shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was also unarmed.

Gerald Thurswell, the McBride family lawyer, said before court Tuesday he believed Wafer was trying to sway opinion on the mostly white jury by talking about how ‘renters’ had been replacing owners in his historically white neighborhood.

Thurswell told reporters that he believed ‘renters’ was a code word for racial minorities.

McBride had been in a car accident after drinking and smoking pot when she came to Wafer's door, according to previous testimony.

Wafer was the last trial witness, and closing arguments are scheduled for Wednesday.
