The central government has informed all states, including Delhi, to conduct regular surveillance of poultry farms after outbreaks of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, in Chhattisgarh and Bihar.

Considering the outbreak of the avian influenza H5N1 virus in the two states, the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has recently informed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Union health ministry, Union home ministry and all the states to carry out regular checks to enable early detection of any possible spread of the virus.

According to officials, the reasons for the outbreak in Chhattisgarh this month, and in Bihar in March, and the factors that help spread it include fluctuating temperatures, poor hygiene conditions at the poultry farms and lack of adequate surveillance.

Fears: The government has ordered all states and authorities to make regular surveillance to prevent a serious outbreak of bird flu

Conditions: Poor hygiene and lack of proper checks are thought to have caused recent outbreaks of the disease, as well worsening conditions due to a heavy monsoon

Past problems: The first reports of bird flu in India came from the village of Nawapur, in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, on February 19, 2006

The same conditions, exacerbated by a heavy monsoon, may give rise to the infection in Delhi as well. Around 200 trucks of chicken reach Delhi wholesale markets daily to cater to the demands of the city and NCR areas. 

First outbreak

In March 2013, when the first outbreak took place in Purnea, Bihar, the government and the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries took several steps, declared India Avian Influenza free, but at the same time called for surveillance.

"India has declared itself free from Notifiable Avian Influenza on 15 June, 2013. It is, however, emphasised that regular surveillance is to be continued throughout the country, especially in the vulnerable area bordering countries and in areas visited by migratory birds," stated a letter by R S Rana, joint secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries.

"Delhi may also be in a bird flu-prone zone as migratory birds from other countries fly here. Nepal, which is already in the grip of bird flu, is nearby and birds can fly over 1,000 kilometres to warmer climes. They may also be carrying the virus," said Dr V K Monga, former chairperson of the health committee of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of DelhiMCD).

Monga, a public health expert, is also president of the organisation Prevention of Public Diseases in India.

"Moreover, Delhi has badly organised poultry farms with the least monitoring. The people handling bird excreta, saliva and other waste products should be very careful," he said.

Two months after the government declared the country "Avian Influenza free", the virus again crept into Jharkhand, resulting in an outbreak.

The government has kept the NDMA in the loop as well.

"We have been informed about the outbreak by the agriculture ministry. In case the Centre or state governments need any help from us, we are ready to extend it.

"Moreover, last time, during outbreaks of swine flu and bird flu we issued advisories to state governments.

"Local health authorities though have a bigger responsibility in terms of surveillance and control. We are ready to coordinate with them," said NDMA vice-chairman Shashidhar Reddy.

A ministry of agriculture letter of this month marked "Most Immediate" confirms bird flu in poultry originating from the "Poultry Production Unit, College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Anjora, Durg" and "Government Poultry Farm, Jagdalpur". Both farms are in Chhattisgarh.

The Delhi government is also preparing proper surveillance plans, according to the "Action Plan of Animal Husbandry for Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza", circulated by the Central government.

"We will be having a meeting soon on the issue and we will carry out extensive surveillance programmes in the city. We will take all necessary action and direct all the concerned doctors to take precautionary measures," said Dr A K Walia, health minister, Delhi government.

The first reports of bird flu in India came from the village of Nawapur, in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra, on February 19, 2006.

Villagers had then reported a large number of bird deaths in the village. After bird flu was confirmed, at least 253,000 birds and 587,000 eggs were destroyed within five days.
