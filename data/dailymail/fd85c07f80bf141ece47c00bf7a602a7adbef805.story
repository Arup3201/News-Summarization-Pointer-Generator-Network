With her arms outstretched as she plunges helplessly to the seabed, this is Les Miserables star Samantha Barks ‘drowning’ in a controversial new campaign which claims it’s cruel to eat fish.

Animal rights activists Peta says the striking image tries to give a sense of the suffering fish go through when they are taken out of water.

Vegetarian Samantha, 24, right, who took the role of Eponine in the 2011 film musical, said: ‘I have a fascination with fish but I think that people see them as lesser than other animals. 

'A dog looks like they’re going to cry when they’re upset and you can’t help but empathise with them. 

'But fish feel pain just the way other animals do.’

A Peta spokesman added: ‘Fish can’t scream as we can, but they certainly suffer.’

Some experts have found evidence that fish can feel pain. One landmark study by scientists from the University of Edinburgh found that trout experience pain in ways comparable to higher mammals. 

However, biologist Dr Bruno Broughton, who advises the fisheries industry, said: ‘Biologically, it has emphatically not been proven that fish feel pain. 

'They lack the advanced part of the forebrain – the neocortex – that deals with pain recognition.’
