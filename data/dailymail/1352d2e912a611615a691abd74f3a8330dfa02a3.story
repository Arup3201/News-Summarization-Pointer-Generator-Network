Preachers of hate are to be ‘silenced’ with new anti-terror orders based on a dramatically tightened definition of extremism and attempts to block their bile on the internet.

The Government is to introduce new civil powers, similar to those used against anti-social behaviour, to target extremists who radicalise others.

They are expected to be used to bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate, associating with named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation, and from entering specific venues, such as mosques or community halls.

Silence: David Cameron wants to silence hate preachers by bringing in new anti-terror orders

The move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by David Cameron after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich.

In its initial report to be detailed 
to Parliament today, the task force will also propose new internet 
filters to block extremist websites and extended powers for watchdogs to
 shut down charities suspected of being fronts for extremist groups.

‘I want to see an end to hate preaching in Britain,’ the Prime Minister said.

As well as new civil orders against 
extremists – dubbed ‘Tebos’, or terror and extremism behaviour orders – 
the Government is to consider the case for another new type of order to 
ban groups which ‘seek to undermine democracy or use hate speech, when 
necessary to protect the public or prevent crime and disorder’.

Controversially, both types of order are to be based on a new definition of extremism which specifically includes a ‘distorted interpretation of Islam’.

It identifies Islamist extremism as a distinct ideology which should not be confused with traditional  religious practice. This ‘distorted’ view argues for a global Islamic state and against ‘liberal values such as democracy, the rule of law and equality’, and tells people they cannot be both Muslim and British.

The Government is also working with internet firms to remove hate-filled websites including material that would be illegal if published in the UK.

Family-friendly filters being made standard for web users to block porn will also be expanded to block extremist material, allowing concerned families and institutions to filter out such websites.

Mr Cameron said: ‘This summer we saw events that shocked the nation with the horrific killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich and murder of Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham.

‘These tragedies were a wake-up call for government and wider society to take action to confront extremism in all its forms, whether in our communities, schools, jails, Islamic centres or universities.

'I have been absolutely clear that this is not something we should be afraid to address for fear of cultural sensitivities.

'We have already put in place some of the toughest terrorism prevention controls in the democratic world, but we must work harder to defeat the radical views which lead some people to embrace violence.

‘The task force I set up has proposed a broad range of measures to counter the extremist narrative.
 When you look at this report, you can see a very clear analysis, a very
 clear definition of the extremism we’re talking about ... now everyone 
can see what it is that we need to tackle.’

He added: ‘There are just too
 many people who have been radicalised at Islamic centres, who have been
 in contact with extremist preachers, who have come across material on 
the internet who haven’t been sufficiently challenged.’

‘Some institutions have wanted to get rid of radicalisers but haven’t had the means to do so,’ he added.

Powers: The move is part of a sweeping package of measures drawn up by an anti-extremism task force set up by David Cameron after the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich

The task force includes Home Secretary Theresa May, Deputy Premier Nick Clegg, Minister for Faith Baroness Warsi, and has taken advice from police and intelligence chiefs.

Other proposals include legally requiring intervention by local authorities in 30 areas identified as radicalism hotspots.
