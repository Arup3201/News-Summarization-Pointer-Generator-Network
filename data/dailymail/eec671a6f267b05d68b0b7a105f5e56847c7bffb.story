Bebe's bizarre career at Manchester United appeared to be over on Tuesday night after he openly told supporters that he is leaving the club this summer.

The Portuguese flop played 45 minutes for the United reserve team against Southport on Tuesday evening before being substituted at half-time following an ineffective display.

He then returned from the dressing-room before the majority of the other United players, where he posed for photographs with supporters and signed autographs.

An eye-witness told Sportsmail that when Bebe was asked by fans whether he would be staying at the club, he clearly stated: 'I go, I go.'

Bebe, who signed for United in an explicable £7million deal in 2010, is not part of Louis van Gaal's plans at Old Trafford.

He has not started a single Premier League match in his four years with the club and Sir Alex Ferguson even went on record to admit that he had not seen the player play when he rubber-stamped the deal.

Bebe was not invited to join the pre-season tour of the USA and United are looking for a buyer for the forward and Benfica are understood to be the favourites to secure his signature with a deal believed to have been agreed in principle between the Portuguese club and the player.

Meanwhile, Tom Lawrence, one of the youngsters handed a debut by Ryan Giggs towards the end of last season is understood to have agreed a new long-term contract with the club.

His previous deal expired this summer but United have convinced the 20-year-old to remain Old Trafford despite interest from a host of Premier League and Championship clubs, including Southampton and Newcastle.

Lawrence also featured at Southport while Nicky Butt has returned to the reserve set-up, where he will work alongside Warren Joyce this season.

Butt had been assisting Ryan Giggs with the first-team while Louis van Gaal was away at the World Cup.
