A fire that broke out inside a 80m smoke stack at Port Kembla on New South Wales' south coast is now under control. 

More than 40 firefighters and eight trucks from the NSW Fire and Rescue battled the blaze for several hours which started on Monday about 5.30pm.

The fire is burning at BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla plant on Five Islands Road, according to 9News.

Dramatic footage showed the top of the smoke stack breaking off while flames were seen coming out of it and thick, black smoke blew over surrounding areas of Port Kembla.

Their efforts were assisted by the pouring rain but authorities were yet to decide whether the entire stack needs to be pulled down.

A NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia there have been no reports of injuries or deaths. 

She also confirmed the fire had been contained to the site, and multiple fire and rescue units arrived to battle the blaze.  

Firefighters have cordoned off a 100m exclusion zone to keep people away from the blaze

Crews had to cordon off a 100m exclusion zone to keep people away from the blaze. 

A NSW Fire and Rescue spokesman told AAP fire crews were waiting to be escorted into the building. 

To prevent the stack from crumbling, emergency service personnel doused it in water to discharge activated charcoal, which is used to take in gases that have potential health effects, according to The Daily Telegraph.
