Snow joke: Barry Brennand, right, hired a foam cannon to cover Maggie McElroy's garden with 6ft of bubbles while she was out shopping

Some of us have nice neighbours, some of us have noisy neighbours, but few of us have neighbours who will cover our gardens with foam while we're at the shops.

For mother-of-three Maggie McElroy, however, it was absolutely par for the course when she came back from the supermarket to discover Barry Brennand's latest prank.

Because the two friends - who live next door to each other in a village in north Wales - have been playing tricks on each other for years

In the most recent incident Mr Brennand, 65, hired a foam cannon and covered Mrs McElroy's garden (which he knew to be her pride and joy) with a carpet of white bubbles six feet deep.

Mrs McElroy, 50, was so stunned to come home and see her bungalow looking more like an Alpine chalet, she didn't immediately work out who the culprit was.

She said: 'For a moment, I thought I'd left my washing machine on and that it had gone crazy.

'I jsut couldn't work it out until I heard my neighbours giggling from behind a hedge.'

Thankfully, she saw the funny side and joined her neighbours, who'd been hiding to watch her reaction, as they all waded into the suds and enjoyed a giant foam party.

The care worker admitted Mr Brennand's stunt was in retaliation for her latest escapade, in which she filled his garden with model animals to make it resemble a mini safari park while he was away on holiday.

Mrs McElroy filled her neighbour's back garden
with replica animals including a sabre-toothed tiger,
monkeys, ducks, flamingos, a 10ft crocodile and a sabre-toothed tiger.

She had even piped animal calls and music from Dr Doolittle into Barry's garden.

Today Mrs McElroy admitted even she had been top-trumped.

Even the tree in Mrs McElroy's front garden was covered in foam, and her neighbours were in on the joke

Mr Brennand's stunt was in retaliation for when he returned from holiday to find his garden had been turned into a zoo

She said: 'Barry's been tormenting me with his pranks for years but I thought I'd beaten him for good when I filled his garden full of animals.

'But he got me good and proper with the foam - I've never seen anything like it.'

Mrs McElroy and her milkman husband Peter are close friends with Mr Brennand and his wife Dorothy in the village of Towyn, near Rhyl.

Mr Brennand, who owns a cafe, said: 'Maggie told me she was going away for the day so I knew my opportunity had come.

Residents in the north Wales village of Towyn watched as Mrs McElroy returned home and then waded into the foam for a party

Barry Brennand, right, says he is now dreading how his neighbour will retaliate after he went to great lengths to cover her garden in bubbles

'It was a bit of a late April Fool's Day prank.

'I hired a foam making machine and switched it on in her garden when she was due to return home.

'I couldn't believe how much foam it made - the garden was under 6ft of it.

'The look on Maggie's face when she came around the corner was priceless - she didn't know what the hell was going on.'

Maggie McElroy filled her neighbour's garden with miniature animals and even played animal noises when he came home from holiday last summer

Now Mr Brennand is worried about how his neighbour will retaliate.

He said: 'It was great fun but I'm never going away on holiday again - I dread to think what Maggie will do to me.'

Mrs McElroy said: 'Our feud is not over yet. I don't like being beaten!'
