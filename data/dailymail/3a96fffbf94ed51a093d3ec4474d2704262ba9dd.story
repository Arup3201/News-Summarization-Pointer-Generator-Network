Residents of Liverpool are calling for a reality television show set in the city to be axed over fears it will become the ‘new Benefits Street’.

It comes after a preview for the programme, This Is Liverpool, was uploaded on to YouTube this week.

The promotion, showing bare bottoms, screaming rows and foul language, has already been viewed more than 400,000 times.

Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the Liverpool Echo he wouldn't expect the show to win any Oscars

The controversial programme's pilot episode is set to be broadcast in two weeks' time

Producers hope a pilot episode will be broadcast within two weeks, leading to a series.

But more than 1,000 people have now signed a petition calling for producer Phenomenal Pictures to abandon plans to broadcast the series.

Petition organiser Adam Manley said: ‘This show does not show the true Liverpool, just a very small minority of idiots who are trying to use it as a platform to become famous.

‘You are depicting Liverpool to be something that it is not.

‘You are destroying the image of our great city, that we've all worked hard to change for the better.’

The trailer for the show, uploaded on to YouTube this week, has been viewed more than 400,000 times

Meanwhile, Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the Liverpool Echo he wouldn’t expect the programme to win any Oscars, suggesting it was more of a ‘comedy’ than a serious documentary.

He said: ‘I wasn’t impressed at all with what I've seen and I think people are absolutely right, it does rely on old stereotypes about Liverpool.’

The trailer includes videos of two people’s bottoms on the show, and includes phrases such as, ‘I’m f****** speaking to you – get off this site’, ‘She won’t know whether she’s coming or f****** going when I’m finished with her’ and ‘I’ve had a sex change… I was born a boy’.

One supporter of the campaign, Anna Blenkinsop, said: ‘It reinforces the idea that we're all hostile and confrontational, which obviously isn't the case and is a stereotype we've worked so hard to live down and prove wrong.

‘It seems like a huge step backwards to undo all of that just so a small group of people can have 15 minutes of fame.’

John Kirby said: ‘It embodies everything that is wrong with television today and lowers the IQ of anyone who watches it.

‘The person who thought that this was a good idea should not be allowed to make decisions on their own!.

Another quote in the programme's YouTube trailer is: 'She won't know whether she's coming or f****** going when I'm finished with her'

This character is heard saying: 'I'm f****** speaking to you - get off this site'
