Amid the carnage of the tornadoes that tore through Arkansas this weekend, there are also tales of rescue and courage.

One family was rescued by emergency crews just moments after a twister plowed through their Arkansas neighborhood.

A woman, her parents and her dog were pulled out alive after a tornado struck - and it was all captured on dramatic video - with the storm still raging in the background.

The video was shot by Center Hill resident Tammy Moffitt, about 50 miles northeast of Little Rock.

The family were hiding in a closet when the storm struck.

Karla Stracener was the first to be led to safety, still wearing her pajamas. She walked across what used to be a door to her home.

She said that she was worried about her parents who are in their 80s.

Karla’s mother was next to be pulled out alive as she carefully stepped across the debris.

Her husband was rescued minutes later. Two heroic rescuers by his side helped to provide him support.

They wanted to make sure he was still aware of his surroundings.

'Who’s the president of the United States?' someone asked. 'Heaven only knows!' he replied with laughter.

Sunday's tornado comes three years after a huge storm devastated the Little Rock suburb of Vilonia.

Its
 residents again huddled in storm cellars as the most powerful twister 
this year carved an 80-mile path of destruction through suburbs north of
 the state capital, killing at least 16 people.

Emergency officials began to pick through the rubble to look for survivors as the sun rose Monday morning.

The
 tornado that touched down around 7 p.m. Sunday about 10 miles west of 
Little Rock grew to be half a mile wide and remained on the ground for 
much of that route, authorities said.

It
 was among a rash of tornadoes and heavy storms that rumbled across the 
center and south of the country overnight. The National Weather Service 
warned that the destructive storms were expected to continue Monday in 
the South and Mississippi Valley.

The National Weather Service in North Little Rock said it was virtually certain that the storm that hit Vilonia and nearby Mayflower would be rated as the nation's strongest twister to date this year.

Another twister killed a person in Quapaw, Oklahoma, before crossing into Kansas to the north and destroying 60 to 70 homes and injuring 25 people in the city of Baxter Springs, according to authorities in Kansas.

The overall death toll stood at 17 early Monday.

Among the ruins in Vilonia was a new $14million intermediate school that had been set to open this fall.

'There's just really nothing there anymore. We're probably going to have to start all over again,' Vilonia Schools Superintendent Frank Mitchell said after surveying what was left of the building.

The Arkansas twister shredded cars, trucks and 18-wheelers stuck along Interstate 40 north of Little Rock. After the storm passed, tractor-trailer rigs tried to navigate through the damage as gawkers captured cellphone photos of the destruction.

State troopers went vehicle-to-vehicle to check on motorists and found — with genuine surprise — that no one was killed.

'About 30 vehicles — large trucks, sedans, pickup trucks — were going through there when the funnel cloud passed over,' said Bill Sadler, a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police.

The country had enjoyed a relative lull in violent weather and didn't record the first tornado death until Sunday, when a North Carolina infant who was injured by a twister Friday died at a hospital. But the system that moved through the Plains, Midwest and South on Sunday produced tornadoes that struck several states, including also Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa.
