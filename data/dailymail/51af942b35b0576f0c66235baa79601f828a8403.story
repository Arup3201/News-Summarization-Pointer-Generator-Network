With an unruly head of hair and scruffy beard, he hardly looks like the best connected foreigner in China.

But Daniel Foa, 36, will soon become just that when Xi Jinping ascends to become the country's next paramount leader in mid-November.

The British entrepreneur is married to, and has a child with, Mr Xi's niece Hiu Ng.

Mr Foa's powerful connections were 
shown to be on the rise when, three years ago, he hired The Great Hall 
of the People in Tiananmen Square to host a private dinner for Chinese 
and Western businessmen.

Holding
such an event in the home of Chinese politics - where the Communist 
Party will next month reveal its new line-up of leaders, including Mr Xi
- is almost unheard of.

For
it to have been hosted by a British-born businessman, albeit with his 
connected wife, is a testament to how deep Mr Foa's links with the 
Chinese establishment now extend.

High-profile guests included Maurice 
Strong, 83, a former under-secretary general of the United Nations, and 
Yang Guomeng, the chief executive of Chinese communications company TOM.

One
guest told the Daily Telegraph: 'Both of them were very professional. 
They are not just socialites. She got the room, and she seemed to be in 
control and he was supporting her. She is smart at business, and he 
seems to be too.'

All this is a long way from Mr Foa's more modest routes back in Britain.

Born in Wimbledon, he attended the nearby Donhead school before taking his A-levels at Esher college in Surrey.

Following a stint at Portsmouth University, Mr Foa arrived in Shanghai a 'buccaneer', according to one friend, at the age of 23.

He set about working his way up 
through a succession of multi-national companies, including IBM, and 
making inroads with the expat community, where he is remembered for 
enjoying the city's bars and nightlife.

He also captained a local football team, the Virgin Red Stars.

One
expat who knew Mr Foa said: 'I have no negative opinions about him at 
all. But I did not consider him likely to be able to penetrate China to 
the extent that he has. How does a guy like that make contact with the 
niece of Xi Jinping?'

Mr Foa moved to Beijing in 2005. He now lives with his wife, who speaks fluent English, in the Shunyi suburb of the city.

They have run a number of businesses focusing on charity and sustainability over the last five years.

But friends now say it is increasingly difficult to maintain social contact with Mr Foa, such is the high security that comes with marrying into what will soon be China's first family.

One told the Telegraph: 'These Red families are the aristocracy of China. They will have done their due diligence on him, he will have signed the contract and he is now living that closed and highly controlled existence. Would you do it? I would not.'

Mr Foa's parents, Marco Foa and Mila Hurst, have separated.

His father lives in a modest Â£250,000 terraced house in Cheltenham, situated just 200yards away from the home Zara Phillips shares with husband Mike Tindall.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I know Marco, but only to say hello. He's a quiet man who keeps himself to himself. He seems nice though.'

Mr Foa's rise to prominence comes just one week after it emerged that a leading Chinese politician linked to the murder of Neil Heywood, another British entrepreneur, is to be tried for allegedly covering up the killing.

Former leadership contender Bo Xilai has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party after being charged with abuse of power, taking bribes and other crimes including the alleged cover-up.

His wife, Gu Kailai, 52, and her butler were found guilty in August of poisoning Mr Heywood, 42, with cyanide.

If found guilty, Mr Bo, 63, could face the death penalty.

Father-of-two Mr Heywood was found dead in a Chongqing hotel room last November. Gu claimed he had threatened to harm her 24-year-old son, Guagua, if he did not receive a larger pay-off for laundering millions of pounds.

It is the latest step in a scandal that has overshadowed the political transition now set to take place in early November.

The party's Politburo said that Mr Bo had been a candidate for top office until caught up in the scandal that included the murder of Mr Heywood.
