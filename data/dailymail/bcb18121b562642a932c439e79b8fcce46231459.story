A mystery that has eluded the family of a Minnesota cancer victim for nearly 20 years is on its way to being solved thanks to internet sleuths.

On Monday Janna Holm posted images of two index cards, covered in a seemingly unbreakable code, that her grandmother, Dorothy Holm, had written just weeks before her death in 1996.

Less than 15 minutes later the code was on its way to being solved after a web user spotted a possible method to the madness of jumbled letters.

Mystery: The back of one of the index cards appears to be the first letters of each word of the Lord's Prayer

Final thoughts: Dorothy Holm wrote the coded index cards before her death in 1996

When she posted pictures of two of the index cards on Metafilter, Ms Holm, who works at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, explained her grandmother had lost her ability to speak when she wrote them.

Ms Holm said the family had been trying to find meaning in the jumble of letters that covered 20 index cards ever since her grandmother died from a brain tumor.

'My cousins and I were between 8-10 years 
old at the time, and believed she was leaving us a code. We puzzled over
 them for a few months trying substitution ciphers, and didn't get 
anywhere,' she wrote.

The family's best guess had been that the letters were perhaps lyrics to songs, but shortly after images of the cards were circulated online, a user known as harperpitt suggested they were prayers.

After suggesting a sequence of triple As on the card could represent 'Amen Amen Amen', harperpitt and another user, jessamyn, cracked part of the code, pointing out that the letters matched the Lord's Prayer. 

'Holy cow! 14 minutes to solve the 
back of the card that has been bugging my family for 20 years! That is 
amazing!' Ms Holm wrote.

Once
 the theory behind the letters was revealed, web sleuths set about 
cracking other parts of the index card, which showed what appeared to be
 a personal prayer.

'It was kind of relieving to have an answer, even if we don’t know what every single word says,' Ms Holm said.

'It’s
 nice to know that they were prayers, and kind of gave some insight into
 what she was thinking and what she was focused on in her last couple 
weeks.'

Solved: Janna Holm says the cards had puzzled her family for years

Comfort: Janna says it was relieving to know what had been on her grandmother's mind

She added that her grandmother hated being in the spotlight 'so she would totally hate all of this [attention],' but Ms Holms told Mashable that she was grateful the mystery had been solved.

The family had almost forgotten about the cards until Ms Holms's father found one of them again, sparking the curiosity of what they had meant. 

Ms Holms was just 11 when her grandmother died. Dorothy Holms, who lived in Shakopee, was diagnosed with lung cancer that formed a brain tumor.

The kindly grandmother, who was married to a Second World War submariner, 'never flew in a plane and never drove a car (scared of both), and hated having her photo taken,' she remembered.

But she was always ready with a stash of coloring books and crayons for when her grandchildren visited,' Ms Holm said.

In her final weeks, Dorothy Holm wrote line after line of capital letters on about 20 index cards, sparking her the curiosity of her grandchildren.

Ms Holm said that she, her brother and two cousins - ranging in age from 8 to 12 - spent a few months trying to figure out what the letters stood for, but failed.

The associate director at Johns Hopkins has offered more details about her family, and gave their initials, in the hope that a message for them may be contained in the prayer.

Hidden message: Janna Holm posted this picture of one of her grandmother's index cards online to see if anyone could break the code

'As for first initials, my family's show up in one string (TVJE is my parents, myself and my brother), but no one else seems to. Her husband's initial was L, but he goes by a nickname starting with B,' she wrote.

'Her children are G, T and J. Her daughter G is unmarried with no children. Her son T is married to V and has J & E as children. And her daughter J is married to M and has L & E as children.'

A large portion of the card has been solved, but code-breakers are still needed to complete the puzzle.
