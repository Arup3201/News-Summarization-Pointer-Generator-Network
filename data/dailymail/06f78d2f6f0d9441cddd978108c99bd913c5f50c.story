A couple whose teenage son drowned during a school excursion were awarded just a fraction of the $100 million they were seeking because the judge ruled the father was not a 'witness of truth'.

Almost half-a-million dollars will be paid by the Presbyterian Church to the Chainas after Nathan Chaina died on a trip organised by a prestigious Sydney school.

The Scot's College student drowned during a hike at the school's Glengarry campus in the Kangaroo Valley in 1999.

The 15-year-old's family sued the eastern Sydney school's operator, the Presbyterian Church Property Trust.

On Friday, the NSW Supreme Court ordered the trust to pay the Chainas $492,373 in compensation.

But this was only a fraction of the $100 million the family wanted.

Nathan's parents, George and Rita Chaina claimed their companies - Proton Technology Pty Ltd and Deluxe Chemicals Pty Ltd - had suffered because of the trauma they had experienced after their son's death.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports Justice Davies said the mental harm the pair had gone through had disintegrated by 2011.

He said the couple's failure to engage in the relaunch of their companies' products was not the school's fault.

Justice Davies went on to say Mr Chaina was not a 'witness of truth' and had not given consistent replies during evidence.

'(Mr Chaina) had a fixed and almost delusional view about himself, his own abilities and expertise and about the success and reputation of his companies, in the face of strong evidence to the contrary,' he said.

'He said whatever he believed would help him to win this case and obtain very substantial damages.

'This was at least partly motivated by his desire for vengeance.'

Initially Mr Chaina said in 2005 he had a Bachelor of Science from UNSW along with completing a business and marketing course.

But it was later revealed he had been making it up for about 40 years as well as the claim that he had been head-hunted to work at Procter and Gamble in New York.

'We are trying to do the right thing by the public, and that's why we did it - so it doesn't happen again,' Mr Chaina said after the hearing.

Justice David Davies is set to make make another ruling about the possibility of paying interest as well as the compensation, as well as who will pay the costs of the case.

The family, from Vaucluse, said they spent more than $20 million on the case last year.

'[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature, together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures'

The state's Deputy Coroner Jan Stevenson previously ruled The Scots College was to blame for the tragedy.

The college commands fees worth tens of thousands of dollars.

'[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures,' Ms Stevenson said in 2001.

The teenager was reported missing for about 15 hours before his body was found in Yurrunga Creek in Kangaroo Valley. It was 24 hours after he fell into the water when crossing the creek.

Nathan was separated from the excursion group because of heavy flooding.
