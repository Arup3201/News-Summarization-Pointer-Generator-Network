Tributes have been paid to a Preston granddad who graced the cobbles of British television’s most famous street for more than fifty years.

Chris Canavan, who was the longest serving extra in Coronation Street, has died aged 84. Best known for being in the background in The Rovers Return in Weatherfield, Chris, who lived in Fulwood, died from a heart attack last Thursday.

He had been in the show for almost as long as William Roache, who plays the soap’s longest running character Ken Barlow.

Family and friends of Coronation Street extra Chris Canavan have paid tribute to him after his death aged 84

Today, friends and Coronation Street colleagues paid tribute to a 'lovely character' with a passion for acting.

A programme spokesman on behalf of Coronation Street said: 'We are very saddened to hear of Chris’ death he was a lovely man who was a pleasure to be around on set.

'He will be missed by everyone here at Coronation Street.'

Chris, who was born in Belfast, was an extra in the show from 1962.

On occasion he played characters including Dusty, the rat catcher and a window cleaner.

He was the first ever customer in the shop on the cobbles, the Kabin and went on to be the first customer in the new Kabin.

The majority of Chris’ extra work saw him in The Rovers, but he has also been spotted in Roy’s Rolls and he was at Rita and Dennis’s wedding.

As a young man, Chris was in the Merchant Navy and later married his late wife Maureen. He got involved with drama groups and later trained at a drama school in Southport.

He went on to take over a window cleaning firm and built it into a cleaning contract company, but he continued with his passion for acting in his spare time, joining Preston Drama Club and Broughton Players.

He was in a play directed by future Coronation Street star Roy Barraclough, which won prizes at Skipton Festival, catching the eye of a TV insider.

Chris went on to secure parts in dozens of television programmes for both Granada and the BBC, including Prime Suspect, The Liver Birds and Brideshead Revisited with the legendary Sir Laurence Olivier.

In an interview last year Chris said: 'Acting is a way of life. Performing was in the family.'

Don Stephenson, chairman of Preston Drama Club said: 'He was a character, a lovely character. He was full of life, right up until being in his 80s.

Chris Canavan worked as an extra on Coronation Street from the programme's early days in 1962

'He wasn’t the most reliable on the lines but he had a wonderful personality. He would give anecdotes on it (Coronation Street), he was very proud. He was still going down train even though he was in his 80s.'

Adrienne Hurley, Chris’ neighbour and member of Broughton Players added: 'I have known him forever. We have lived next door to each other for 27 years.

'He has lived there all is married life, he lost his wife shortly before we moved in here. He has had a good long life but there has been a lot of sadness. He was very jolly and twinkly.

'He had a good, loud belly laugh, I used to hear it through the lounge wall.'

She added: 'It was a terrible shock. It is very very sad.'

Alex Tagg, from Preston Playhouse, said: 'He was a very friendly character. He used to say he left home in the early hours of the morning to be on set and they were awfully long days.'

Chris leaves three children and four grandchildren.
