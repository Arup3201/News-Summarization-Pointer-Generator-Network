The 40-year-old African-American New York City man who has been accused in the beating death of an innocent bystander, who was Caucasian, has had a history of racial prejudice, according to his family.

Martin Redrick, 40, has been charged with assault in connection to the death of 62-year-old Jeffrey Babbitt, whom police say the suspect punched once in Union Square Park last Wednesday in an unprovoked attack that may have been racially motivated.

The victim was struck with such force that the beating left him brain dead. On Monday, Mr Babbitt passed away.

History of violence: Family say Redrick has long been hostile towards white people, suffered from a severe drug addiction and schizophrenia, and has had numerous run-ins with the law

Killed by a single punch: Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, has died at a New York City hospital after being left brain dead when he was punched by a stranger in an alleged racist hate crime

Redrick, who had been wrongly 
identified in earlier reports as 31-year-old Lashawn Marten - an alias 
he has apparently given to police following his arrest - was said to be 
angry at white commuters for bumping into him and was overheard 
threatening to punch one before he attacked Babbitt.

The deadly confrontation did not come as a surprise to those who know Redrick.

His brother Joseph Redrick told the New York Times that as a youth, his younger sibling detested figures of authority, who were exclusively white.

However,
 not all of his interactions with Caucasian Americans were negative: his
 own son was adopted by his brother Joseph and his then-wife, Scarlett 
Thomas, who is white.

Ms 
Thomas, who divorced Joseph Redrick in 2009, recalled that Martin was always kind to her daughter from a 
previous marriage, whom he called, 'my precious little Snow White.'  

Mr
 Redrick's behavior reportedly took a turn for the worse when he 
acquired a drug habit in the 1990s, which turned him unpredictable and 
volatile.

Over the years, 
Mr Redrick has had numerous run-ins with the law, including a 1997 
conviction on an assault charge that landed him in jail first for 6 
months, and then for 16 more as punishment for a probation violation.

Redrick had been leading a transient 
lifestyle in Newburgh, New York, where the local police became well 
acquainted with him, handing him summonses for trespassing and drinking 
from an open container. 

As
 time went on, Mr Redrick began showing violent tendencies. In 2002, he 
was arrested twice for throwing bottles at police officers, one of him 
he also punched in the face.

In
 2007, Martin Redrick was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after which he 
disappeared, re-emerging only three years later in New York City.

Attacked: Mr Babbitt has died following the punch which left him bleeding on the ground last week in New York City

Charged: Lashawn Marten, 31, in custody in a police cruiser He allegedly stood up from a chess table in Union Square Park, said 'I'm going to knock out the next white person who walks by' and assaulted Jeffrey Babbitt

Scarlett
 Thomas, his sister-in-law, recalled that Redrick called her last year 
out of the blue, seemingly unaware that he had been gone for three 
years.

Redrick's troubles 
with the law did not stop when he moved from Newburgh to Manhattan. He 
was arrested in mid-August for allegedly trying to strike a woman in 
Harlem and then spitting in her face.

Tragic: Mr Babbitt, who was the sole carer for his 92-year-old mother, died in hospital

Martin
 Redrick has been living in a home for people with mental illness where
 residents can receive help but are free to come and go at will.

The
 40-year-old has been spending a lot of time playing chess in Union 
Square Park recently. Other chess enthusiasts described him as a quiet 
loner who appeared to suffer from mental problems.

In
 conversations with his opponents, Mr Redrick would at times hint at 
past altercations, even boasting about 'knocking' someone out .

Last Wednesday, 62-year-old Jeffrey Babbitt, the sole carer of his 92-year-old mother Hedda, was hit so hard that he fell to the ground in Union Square Park but later managed to stand.

His condition deteriorated soon afterwards and he died at Bellevue Hospital Monday. 

His mother Mrs Babbitt, who the retired train 
conductor shared a Brooklyn apartment with, had been at his hospital's 
bedside since Wednesday.

Two other white men, aged 48 and 18, 
suffered minor injuries after allegedly being attacked by Redrick as they
 tried to help Mr Babbitt who was lying on the ground.

Footage of the aftermath of the assault shows the victim on the ground, with blood pouring from his head.

Redrick, who has a previous criminal record and uses various aliases, was charged with assault and is due in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. It is likely his charges will now be upgraded.

According to one female witness last week, Redrick said: 'The next white person who 
walks by I’m going to f***'.

She added: 'His fist went in 
and the man’s head bobbed and he hit the ground and you could hear his 
skull hitting the ground.'

Michael Benson, who also saw that attack, told ABC Local: 'The
 guy got agitated for some reason or another and he said, "The 
next white person that bumps into me without saying excuse me, I'm going
 to knock him out".'

After his racist rant and attack, witnesses said Redrick stayed at the park and waited for police to arrive.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said 
Redrick's alleged comments about targeting white people before allegedly 
punching Mr Babbitt could lead to hate crime charges being made against 
him.

'Our Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in aspects of that case,' he added.

Redrick is being held on a $1million bond as police decide whether to also charge him with a hate crime.
