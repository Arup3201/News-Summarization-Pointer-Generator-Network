This is the death-defying moment a kayaker plunged 30 feet from the top of an icy waterfall into the freezing water below. 

The heart-stopping images show Todd Wells tackling the waterfall on the Little White Salmon River, a tributary of the Columbia River in Washington, USA.

The pictures, taken during a freak cold spell, capture the professional sportsman mid-air as he drops down the 30-foot waterfall, known as Spirit Falls.

Thrill seeking: Todd Wells, a professional sportsman, who plunged 30 feet down an icy waterfall into the freezing water below just using a kayak 

Death defying: Mr Wells can be seen mid-air as he makes his way down the waterfall, which is considered one of the toughest in the world to navigate in a kayak 

Mr Wells paddled his way down the icy river alongside his photographer friend Eric Parker in the lead-up to his death-defying stunt.

Mr Wells, who is no stranger to hurtling over rapids of icy cold water, says taking on the Little White Salmon River was the highlight of a lifetime. 

He said: 'This kayak experience was out of this world and definitely one of the best moments of my life.'

Plunge: Mr Wells was captured on camera plunging into the water by photographer Eric Parker, who also took to the white rapid of the Little White Salmon River 

Photographer Mr Parker,  a well-known name in the world of extreme sports photography, said all he needed to capture the shot was his trusted camera.

He explained: 'Rivers are incredible pieces of nature and these pictures show that nature off perfectly.

'There are few things more amazing than water falling in the sky, which is why I love to shoot waterfalls.

He's not even wearing gloves: Mr Wells tackled the waterfall in his kayak and without any gloves, during a freakish cold spell, which left the water freezing after snowfall 

'It was amazing to watch Todd tackle this waterfall so skillfully.'

Spirit Falls is famous among white water kayakers as a tough stretch of water and its waterfall is considered one of the toughest plunges to navigate.

It is extremely difficult to stay afloat and some kayakers have sustained serious injuries by attempting to tackle the waterway.
