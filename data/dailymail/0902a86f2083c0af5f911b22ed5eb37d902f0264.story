These shocking photos show the devastating state a beautiful nature sanctuary was left in by a group of travellers after they were evicted from the site. 

The 113-acre park, home to 190 species of bird, has been likened to a 'war-zone' after the group ripped out park benches and dumped a 60-ton mountain of rubbish upon being asked to leave on Friday. 

Littered among the sprawling heap of abandoned goods at Chase Nature Reserve in Dagenham, east London, were fridges, sofas, gas cylinders and even an exercise bike.

Chaos: The fly-tipping travellers left a trail of devastation in their wake after being evicted from Chase Nature Reserve in Dagenham last Friday

The group had been illegally camping in the park in east London - pictured among the sprawling heap of rubbish are sofas, cabinets and fridges

Piles of wood, cardboard, loose metal and other household appliances can also be seen among the waste tip.

The appalling mess was discovered by local businessman, Peter Harris, 43, as he jogged through the park on Sunday.

Mr Harris, the UKIP parliamentary candidate for Dagenham & Rainham, said: 'The tip was simply unbelievable.

'It was a cross between a war-zone and Frizlands Lane recycling depot in Dagenham. The wildlife we have over there is fantastic so this is just terrible.

'I call the park Dagenham's best-kept secret and for this to happen to such a beautiful place is an absolute disgrace.'

Mr Harris claims some of the park's regular visitors even broke down in tears at the sheer scale of the mess.

It is thought that up to 30 tonnes of garbage have already been removed as part of the massive clean-up operation - expected to take up to a week.

Johnnie Quarrell, 79, of Dagenham, said: 'It's a right old mess down there. I've never seen the park in such a state as it is now.'

Steve Drake, founder of Friends of The Chase, who look after the park, said: 'A lot of tidying up will have to be done to restore the reserve to how it was.'

Almost 200 types of bird live in the special retreat - including kingfishers, skylarks and several birds of prey - and there have also been recent sightings of the rare great snipe, pine bunting and spotted crake.

The reserve forms part of the 207-acre Eastbrookend Country Park, which was created out of derelict land and opened in 1995 in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

Rated as one of the best urban nature centres in the south-east of England, Chase Nature Reserve also boasts six black poplar trees, only 600 of which remain in the UK.

Devastation: Sprawled across a huge area, the ground underneath the pile of abandoned goods and materials is barely visible
