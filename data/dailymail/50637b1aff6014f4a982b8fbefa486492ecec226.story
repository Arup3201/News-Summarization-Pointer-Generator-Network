The parents of a child suffering from a deadly heart condition who were told not to worry have slammed medical staff who failed to properly diagnose their son.

Angry Peter Green, 52, and Hayley Clarke, 33, said they repeatedly raised concerns over little Harry after their new-born baby continued to lose weight but were told by health visitors and a GP not to worry.

In fact, the baby was suffering from a rare heart defect which had caused a narrowing of his aorta.

And it was only when the child was two months old that doctors realised how serious his condition was, after he was referred to Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk.

Harry was subsequently diagnosed with coarctation, which had caused his heart function to deteriorate rapidly since birth.

The condition had also affected his liver and lungs and led to swelling in the left side of his heart.

And in the most severe cases, such as Harry's, babies can develop serious complications as a result of coarctation, because not enough blood can get through to the rest of the body.

Harry was diagnosed with coarctation and underwent a three-and-a-half hour procedure at London's Evelina Hospital

Within just 24 hours, Harry had a three-and-a-half hour heart operation at London's Evelina Hospital, during which specialists managed to reverse the defect.

His parents, from Stowmarket, have said they believe their son would not have survived if it were not for this late intervention by health staff.

Miss Clarke said: 'I am so angry. If they had done their jobs properly, we would not have gone through all this.

'Luckily, Harry is doing really well now.

'If it weren't for the doctors at Ipswich Hospital, I don't think he would be here with us today: they were fantastic.'

Mr Green came forward after reading about the plight of 22-month-old Harry Robb. The infant was also rushed to Evelina Hospital after blundering medics had diagnosed his life-threatening condition as tonsillitis.

Harry's father has said the couple have now made formal complaints to Suffolk County Council and Stowhealth, the GP practice where Harry was first assessed.

The anxious couple noticed their little boy was struggling to feed and was not putting on weight soon after he was born on November 13 last year.

At weekly weigh-ins with health visitors, Peter and Hayley repeated their worries - but they say they were told their son was completely fine.

Miss Clarke, who also has a daughter, Hollie, seven, said: 'I am Harry's mum, I felt there was something wrong but no one would listen to me.

'Whenever we queried anything we got the same response from the health visitors: 'Don't worry, he will put on weight' - but he never did.'

Harry still only weighed 7lbs 9oz at seven weeks old - still shy of his birth weight of 7lbs 12oz.

It was only following a regular weigh-in at two months old that health visitor Kate Dewsbury urged Peter and Hayley to take Harry to their GP immediately.

Mr Green said: 'He (the GP) said he could refer Harry to the hospital if we liked for peace of mind (and) for general assessment.

'So we left reassured and just waited to see when we could get an appointment.

Days later, however, health worker Ms Dewsbury visited Harry at home.

'She immediately asked me if I could drive and said Harry needed to be taken to the hospital straight away,' said Miss Clarke.

'It was such a shock - all of a sudden it seemed there was something really wrong.'

After attending the hospital appointment on January 5, the couple were told their son had a serious heart condition.

Doctors arranged for Harry to be transferred to Evelina Hospital, where he was operated on the following day.

Harry underwent a three-and-a-half hour procedure, during which he was put on an emergency heart bypass.

'When the specialist team from the Evelina came to intensive care to collect Harry they told us they were amazed he was still alive,' said his father, Mr Green, a mortgage broker

'They said we were lucky he hadn't collapsed by that stage.'

After two weeks at the hospital, in intensive care and on the cardiac ward, Harry was transferred back to Ipswich Hospital before being allowed home.

'Those weeks were the worst of our lives, worrying and waiting,' said Mr Green.

Dr Baber Yusaf, senior partner at GP practice StowHealth said: 'We sympathise with the family at this difficult time.

'The whole team at StowHealth always strive to do the best we can.'
