A brilliant goal from Gareth Bale wasn't enough for Real Madrid as they lost on penalties after a 1-1 draw with Inter Milan in the International Champions Cup.

The Welshman took just 10 minutes to open his pre-season account as he burst through Inter's midfield before unleashing a powerful left-footed effort which swerved beyond Samir Handanovic

It was a typically eye-catching strike from Bale, who had already hit the bar with a header after just three minutes at the California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, California.

Jonathan wasted Inter's best opportunity of the first half when he headed over, while Riben Botta and Dodo both failed to test Diego Lopez.

Yann M'Vila came off the bench for his Inter debut before Nemanja Vidic and Marco Andreoli forced substitute keeper Jusus Fernandez into a fine double save.

Carlo Ancelotti's side appeared on course to join Manchester United at the top of Pool A on three points until Inter defender Vidic was fouled in the Real penalty box.

Mauro Icardi made no mistake from the spot as pulled of a Panenka-style spot-kick to level the score at 1-1 after 68 minutes.

Both sides pushed for a winner as the game went on, but they were forced to go to direct to penalties - in line with the competition's rules - when a third goal could not be found.

In a dramatic shootout, Real duo Isco and Asier Illarramendi has their penalties saved by Juan Pablo Carrizo before youngster Omar Mascarell placed his effort wide.

Icardi then stepped up to net his second spot-kick of the evening to seal two points for the Serie A giants.

Inter face Manchester United in Washington on Tuesday, while Madrid take on Roma in Dallas on the same day.
