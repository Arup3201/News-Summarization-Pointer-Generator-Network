My porch floor looked like something from a crime scene, thanks to the clear outline marked on the ceramic tiles. The evidence of foul play was as shocking as it was uncompromising.

This was not the site of a grisly murder, but it was something almost as disturbing to a houseproud, middle-class wife and mother like me.

There was a sharply delineated oblong of dust, indicating that my cleaner had mopped around the edges of the mat, rather than lifting it up and washing underneath.

What's more, I could still hear the roar of the Hoover from one of the bedrooms above, meaning the perpetrator was still in my house.

In the kitchen, evidence of yet another misdemeanour greeted me: a dirty dishcloth in the sink which had not been rinsed with hot water and soaked in bleach as I'd requested.

Add to this the fact that my cleaner had arrived 15 minutes late that morning without bothering to apologise or explain, and you'd imagine I flew up the stairs to tear a strip or two off her.

But you'd be wrong.

Instead of taking her to task and listing her many failings (why does she think the corners of the carpets don't need to be vacuumed?) I popped my head around the bedroom door.

Taking in the sight of her dreamily trailing a duster along the window ledges, I flashed my brightest smile and asked if she fancied a cuppa.

When she said yes, I trundled obediently down the stairs, disguising the anger I felt at myself for failing to stand up to this woman who takes my hard-earned money every week yet treats cleaning my house as if she's doing me a huge favour.

Home help: Angela can't imagine a happy domestic life without her cleaner

So why is it that I, a strong-minded and fearless journalist who has faced down dangerous criminals and appeared on BBC's Question Time, am incapable of taking my domestic help to task?

The answer? I'm terrified she will leave me.

One wrong word from me and she'll be off - and welcomed into the grateful arms of one of the many working women in neighbouring streets who've been circling her like predatory lionesses.

A cleaner is a precious commodity in this smart suburb of Manchester, and I am told the situation is the same in other middle-class areas around the country.

Cleaners - even lackadaisical ones like mine - are fought over. And the fight is getting dirty as women go to increasingly desperate lengths to keep their cleaner away from enemy clutches.

These days, as long as the domestic help isn't stealing the family silver, desperate working women like me will put up with anything rather than taking time out of their busy schedules to find another one.

I've lost count of the number of times I've spoken to otherwise tough, successful, straight-talking friends who confess to being as weak as kittens when it comes to negotiating terms and pay with their cleaners.

One, a high-flying taxation lawyer, employs a delightful girl who is punctual and charming but insists on spending half an hour each week rearranging the bottles inside the bathroom cabinet.

The first time she did this, my friend - who lectures at industry events around the world - nervously suggested, with a quasi-giggle, that devoting time to such an endeavour wasn't really necessary.

Would it not be more helpful, she tentatively suggested, if she spent the time vacuuming the stairs, digging the hair out the shower drain or cleaning the glass on the patio doors? In other words, the unpleasant jobs that actually needed doing.

The cleaner smiled and nodded. Yet the following week the bottles were lined up like the YSL counter in Harvey Nicks, and a plug of hair the size of a large hamster was left sitting in the shower drain.

Deaf ears? Or a cleaner who knew only too well she had her employer over a barrel?

Another friend actually paid for her Polish cleaner to go back to her village outside Krakow last Christmas, maintaining it was a thank-you for all her hard work. Actually, it was code for: 'Don't leave me - ever.'

I've also seen good friends become sworn enemies after one has poached the other's cleaning lady.

'How could she do that to me?' I overheard one distraught woman ranting in a cafe a few months back. 'The betrayal, the sneaking behind my back. I'll never be able to trust anyone again!'

I tuned in, convinced I was about to eavesdrop on a particularly salacious tale of suburban bed-hopping, only to learn the woman was furious her neighbour had stolen her cleaner - having secretly wooed her for weeks.

I have heard of women inventing aliases for their help, and have one friend who will never tell me her 'brilliant' cleaner's name for fear I might snaffle her. She even refuses to say on what days she is employed, so no one can accost and poach her on the way home.

Like so many working women, I hate myself for giving my cleaner so much power. But what is the alternative?

Every working mother I know needs a cleaner despite putting on endless rounds of washing and keeping on top of the day-to-day mess created by their families.

As well as holding down a full-time job, I provide a taxi service for Sophie, ten and Aaron, 16, as well as a general takeaway food and hotel service to their brothers, Sam, 21 and Max, 19. Why should I spend my days cleaning? Having built a successful 20-year career as a writer and broadcaster, simply playing house would be a waste of my talents.

Without a cleaner, women like me are one heartbeat away from meltdown. We simply don't have time to do it all.

In demand: Good cleaners can be hard to find

Sourcing a good one, however, is not easy. Anyone paid £7 to £10 an hour to clean up someone else's filth isn't going to be committed to the job.

In a cleaner's shoes, wouldn't I swap allegiances if someone down the road was serving better biscuits and let me watch a flat-screen TV while doing the ironing? Damn right I would.

So would I poach someone's cleaner? You bet I would!

A few years ago I hired one who I'd heard moaning about cleaning up after her employer's toddlers, who loved to stuff fishfingers down the back of the sofa.

Sidling up to her at the school gate, I gushed that I'd love her to work for me instead. 'My children are much older,' I said. 'Your life will be so much easier.'

My ruse worked - until six months later I lost her to a single woman with no children.

Only once did I venture a tiny wisp of complaint to a cleaner, doing so by text to soften the implied criticism. She insisted on stuffing into drawers anything that wasn't nailed to the carpet. Consequently I'd spend frustrated hours playing hunt the tax return/morning paper/party invitation.

In the end I sent a chirpy little text asking if she'd seen an M&S bag I'd left on the bed. I didn't hear back for three days.

Edging into panic for my rash action, I nearly expired with joy when she finally replied, apologising that her phone was broken.

And now my latest cleaner wants to go. She left a voicemail offering some rambling excuse about wanting to cut her hours.

My husband Martin saw it as a moment to rejoice, with a lecture about how paying this woman was like setting tenners on fire.

He was right. There has to be somebody out there who could do a better job - or at the very least lift a mat when mopping the floor.

I crept upstairs to text back my response: 'Will it make a difference if I pay a bit more?'
