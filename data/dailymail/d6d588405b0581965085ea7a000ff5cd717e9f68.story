An Atlanta woman says she was turned away from four hospital before one agreed to remove a huge tumor that was growing in her belly because she was uninsured.

Doris Lewis, 59, is a grandmother but with her enormous tumor looks as though she is heavily pregnant.

At first, Lewis says she didn't realize she had a tumor.

Huge growth: Doris Lewis's massive tumor is finally going to be removed after four hospitals rejected her for not having insurance

Suffering: The tumor grew to enormous proportions within two months, leaving Lewis in great pain

'I didn't know it was a tumor in there. I thought I was just gaining weight at first,' Lewis told WBS-TV.

But within just two months, the tumor had swollen to the size of a beach ball, and showed no sign of stopping.

Lewis went to various hospitals but none would help to relieve her of the tumor, which is benign but extremely painful.

'It's getting bigger every day,' she told WSB-TV.

'I can feel it on my body. My heart hurts a little bit.'

She says she has been trying to get insurance since her husband died a few years ago but had no success, and that when she tried to sign up for affordable healthcare, she was told she had missed a deadline.

Uninsured: Lewis says she has tried to get insurance in the years since her husband died but had been unsuccessful

The tumor is wrapped around her ovaries and has her family extremely concerned.

Recently, Lewis was in so much pain with the huge growth that she called 911 and was taken to Emory University Hospital in midtown.

Finally, a doctor told her that she would be treated, with or without insurance.

Doctors were amazed at the size of Lewis's tumor, telling her it was the largest they had ever seen.

'Some of the guys looked at me and said, "You got a tumor in there that is so big it's about to pop,"' Lewis told WSB-TV.

Her surgery is scheduled for June 10 and it can't come quick enough for Lewis.

'It would feel great, now, if I could get it out today. Right now. It would be a blessing,' she told WSB-TV.
