That 'infamous' suit worn by Nine morning presenter Karl Stefanovic, to prove a point over sexism, is now up for sale on Ebay.

The Today show host wore the Burberry blue suit every day for a whole year, just changed his shirt and tie, and made the internet go 'a little bit crazy' all to make aware the double standards women face, especially in the television industry.

And now it can be yours! The little bit 'stanky' suit is being auctioned off to the highest bidder all for a good cause.

Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic has worn the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry

Karl's 'infamous' blue suit is now up for sale on Ebay and the bidding starts at $1000

All proceeds from its sale will go to the White Ribbon Australia charity, a campaign to end violence against women 

At the starting bid of $1000, all proceeds from its sale will go to the White Ribbon Australia charity, a campaign to end violence against women, which Karl is a big advocate.

'This issue needs to be addressed from the highest levels of society in terms of the law and the way our perpetrators are sentenced,' Karl told Fairfax Media.

So if you feel in the need for a new suit, with a bit of a background history to it, you've got until November 24 until 11.46am to make a bid.

The description says, 'you have the chance at purchasing this suit for yourself, imagine how good you'd look in it! Super comfy, super stylish, super cool.'

Karl added, 'it's a little bit stanky, note may need dry cleaning ASAP.' 

Channel Nine presenter Karl Stefanovic (pictured) conducted the year-long experiment into the double standards faced by his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson (pictured right)

After revealing that he wore his Burberry suit every year for a day the Today show presenter decided to put it up on auction on Ebay to raise money for Charity White Ribbon Australia 

After Stefanovic revealed his everyday workwear on Saturday, he said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. 

He said no one had even noticed his choice of attire while women got the brunt of everything from the colour they wore to thousands of tweets about something wrong they said.

'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test),' Karl told Fairfax Media. 

Stefanovic's  experiment sparked a media frenzy worldwide with interest coming from websites like the BBC and New York Post.

Feminist website Jezabel were among those to weigh in on the experiment.

Reporter Isha Aran wrote: 'As hilarious and interesting as this is, he simply proved something we all already know, the double standard women deal with on a day-to-day basis'.

MTV.com quipped that everyone should pitch in for his dry cleaning bill.

'Stefanovic’s experiment is definitely hilarious but it also shines an important light on what his female colleagues have to deal with every day,' they wrote.
