A boom in smartphone use is being blamed for an alarming rise in the number of children killed and injured on Britain's roads, a report reveals today

A boom in smartphone use is being blamed for an alarming rise in the number of children killed and injured on Britain’s roads, a report reveals today.

Children crossing the road are ‘distracted’ by texting friends, ‘tweeting’ messages, surfing the internet, playing games or visiting Facebook instead of paying attention to traffic.

Alarming new statistics reveal that serious road accidents involving young children are at a ten-year high – particularly among girls.

The report says the smartphone phenomenon is a factor. ‘There is a clear correlation between the use of technology and the time of serious accidents with children – particularly at the time of leaving school for the day,’ it concludes.

Parents are giving the phones to their children at ever-younger ages – often for reasons of personal security but in some cases having been nagged into providing one to keep up with their peers, say experts.

Nearly half of children aged ten have a smartphone, rising to three-quarters by age 12.

Perhaps significantly, the age of 11 is both the highest risk age for child pedestrians and the average age at which children receive their first mobile phone.

The report – by insurance company AXA and backed by the road safety partnership RoadSafe – is based on Department of Transport statistics and a poll of 1,000 eight to 18-year-olds who were questioned about mobile phone usage.

It notes that a quarter of 11 and 12-year-olds – acknowledged as the ‘danger group for road casualties’ – and about a third of 14-year-olds ‘reported that they were distracted when crossing a road due to using personal mobile technology’.

But the problem starts much earlier. ‘By the age of ten almost half  of children have received their first mobile phone,’ says the report. ‘By age 12, 73 per cent of children have a mobile phone.

More significantly, they use their mobile phone functions much more than younger children do.

‘Because of this 25 per cent acknowledge that they themselves have been distracted by personal technology when crossing a road.’

At the same time about a third of pedestrians killed or seriously injured at the times of the school run were 11 and 12-year-olds.

The pedestrian casualty rate for girls rises steeply from the age of 11, and both they and boys are three times as likely to be involved in an accident as a 10-year-old. This is an increase from ‘twice as likely’ just ten years ago.

Overall, 2,400 children under the age of 16 were killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads in 2011. But in five years there was a ‘proportionate rise’ in child deaths and casualties among pedestrians – from 61 per cent of all accidents in 2006 to 66 per cent in 2011.

Alarmingly, the proportion of death and serious injury on the roads among children under five is at the highest level for 10 years – at 14 per cent – ‘and continues to rise’.

Casualties for girls aged five to seven have risen by 45 per cent in the past five years – from  77 to 112.
