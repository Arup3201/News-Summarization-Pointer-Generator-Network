A teacher has been summoned to court and faces a £1,000 fine because her wheelie bin juts out just 12 inches beyond the boundary of her home.

Alex Young, 47, is to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court after her local council said the grey plastic bin could present a hazard to drivers and disabled people.

It said the bin could prevent grass from being cut - even though there is not a patch of green in sight around the rear of her three-bedroom home.

Ms Young was also told that the bin's appearance could 'negatively impact on the street scene environment'.

The frustrated householder has attacked the move by Stevenage Borough Council as 'complete nonsense' and a waste of taxpayers' money.

She pointed out that Stevenage Borough Council's own grit bins and concrete posts jut further into the road than her bin.

It has told her to place the bin in the driveway that leads to her garage - but a frustrated Miss Young says it would then block access to her home.

The teacher, who works at Hitchin Boys' School and offers private tutoring, says she has nowhere to put the solitary
 bin other than on the raised concrete area behind her terraced house. She has accused the council of using bullying tactics to drag her into court.

'It is a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money,' she told Mail Online.

'You have no idea how much stress it's caused me - I've since been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and one of the aggravating causes is stress.

'I have to be down there [at court] on a Monday afternoon and my students have their A-levels days later. I should be there helping my students and instead I'm arguing over a bin and having my time wasted.

'Sharon Taylor, the council leader, just got an OBE for caring about the people of Stevenage. It's appalling'.

Miss Young, a widow since her husband died of motor neurone disease nine years ago, will plead not guilty at the hearing later this month.

The charge brought under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 alleges that she failed in the 'placing of receptacles as required for the purpose of 
avoiding a nuisance or detriment to the amenities of the area'.

'Obstruction and arson risk': Miss Young, right, says she has faced more than a year of stress over her bin since she was sent the first letter by Stevenage Borough Council on December 12, 2011, right

The council says the bin is on 'public land' and is an obstruction to the highway and to people who are visually impaired or use wheelchairs.

Miss Young says the row goes back to 2011 when 
she complained about the lid of her recycling box being damaged after it was left in the road by refuse collectors.

On one occasion, her recycling was not 
taken away after an empty Ben and Jerry's ice cream carton was found to 
contain some plastic.

She and her neighbours, a retired couple, found themselves having to get out of cars to move emptied boxes and wheelie bins.

In the end, Miss Young asked the 
council to remove the recycling bins and she has been using a
 solitary grey wheelie bin for all her rubbish ever since.

In December 2011, she received a Fixed 
Penalty Notice from the council notifying her she had to pay a fine of 
£100 for the 'Incorrect presentation of waste receptacles'.

Their target: The council's letter says the bin could impede to grass cutting - even though there is barely a blade of grass to be seen on the quiet cul-de-sac

Inches out of place: The 47-year-old's bin has been labelled a potential hazard for disabled people and a blot on the landscape

She was told in the summer she could appeal against the fine, which she duly did, and then heard nothing more.

Then, on December 20 2012, she came home to find a
 letter telling her that she was to appear in Stevenage 
Magistrates' Court on New Year's Eve over the issues with her rubbish, and could have to pay out up to £1,000.

'Because Christmas was coming up, I 
couldn't speak to anyone at the council or the court. It came completely
 out of the blue and gave me no time.

'I had lodged my appeal but then 
heard nothing for months. I had made arrangements to go away for the new
 year and the letter spoilt completely my Christmas and my holiday 
because I was so stressed by it all.'

On New Year's Eve, she managed to 
contact the court and her case has been put back. She faces a two-hour hearing later this month.

Stevenage Borough Council could not be reached for comment today.
