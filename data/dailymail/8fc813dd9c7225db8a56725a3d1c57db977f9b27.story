Two police firearms officers are being investigated over claims they killed an injured deer with a crowbar.

The officers had been sent to humanely destroy the animal after it was hit by a vehicle.

But instead of using the weapons they were carrying – as expected in the situation – they instead decided to use a crowbar to bludgeon the stricken deer to death.

Taken out of its misery: A deer like the one beaten to death by two Durham police officers

Durham Police said the officers had been trained to humanely kill large animals as part of their duties and had no explanation as to why they chose the unorthodox method.

The force confirmed it was investigating the incident, adding that the deer was ‘apparently not destroyed in a humane manner’.

Animal rights charities said the officers should be ‘locked up’ if an investigation found they did beat the deer to death unnecessarily. 

A member of the pubic called police after the deer was found knocked over in Tanfield Lea, County Durham, in June.

Police would usually ask a vet to deal with the animal, but as one could not reach the scene quickly enough, an armed response unit was sent instead. But rather than following procedure and using their firearms to end the deer’s suffering as quickly as possible, they used a crowbar.

The approved method of humane destruction, according to the police, is to authorise the crew in an armed response vehicle to use their weapons to shoot the injured animal so that the death is as clean and quick as possible.

Officers have to be given authority to use their weapons by a duty inspector. The incident only came to light after other officers, who were not present at the time, were made aware of what had happened.

It was reported to senior officers earlier this month and the pair involved have been moved to other duties while an investigation is carried out. They could face a misconduct hearing or criminal charges. 

Yesterday a spokesman for animal rights group Peta said: ‘If it turns out that police officers did, in fact, bludgeon a deer to death, they should be not only struck off, but also locked up.’

A spokesman for Durham Police said: ‘It is not unusual for firearms officers to be deployed on occasions when a deer, or other large animal, is clearly suffering as the result of being struck by a vehicle and the best action would be for the animal to be humanely destroyed.

‘We can confirm inquiries are being made to establish the circumstances surrounding the destruction of an injured deer on a road in Tanfield Lea in early June.

‘It has been brought to our attention that the deer was apparently not destroyed in the approved, humane manner.’

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This sounds like a terrible incident and we await the conclusion of the police investigation.’
