A 20-month-old girl who vanished a week before Christmas after being put to bed in her father's home was taken away and didn't walk out on her own, investigators said today as they announced the largest reward ever offered in the state to help find a missing person.

It marked the first time since the search for Ayla Reynolds began that police have directly said they don't believe she left the house by herself.

'At this point in the investigation... we are confident that Ayla did not walk out of the house by herself,' Waterville police Chief Joseph Massey said at a news conference at which he announced a $30,000 reward was being offered for help finding her.

Toddler: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, was reported missing from her bed on Saturday morning by her father Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed the previous night

'We believe that someone was involved
in taking her out of the house, and that's where the focus of this 
investigation has turned.'

The reward, gathered with donations 
from residents and businesses in the Waterville area, is the biggest 
ever offered in Maine for a missing person, state Department of Public 
Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said.

Massey said the developments in a 
mystery that's been featured on national television programs have not 
shifted the matter from a missing-person case to a criminal 
investigation. Despite the passing of the Christmas holiday with no sign
of Ayla, police remain committed to finding her, the chief said.

'The intensity of the investigation 
is as high today as it was the first day,' he said. 'We continue to 
employ every single resource we have.'

Blames father: Trista Reynolds, little Ayla's mother, said the girl's father should have protected her

Removed: Trista, a recovering alcoholic, said state officials removed Ayla from her care while she went into rehabilitation

Massey was joined at the news conference by Waterville attorney John Nale, who appealed for the safe return of Ayla.

'I ask and I plead with the person or
persons who have Ayla Reynolds that they please keep her safe and 
return her safely to us,' Nale said.

Hundreds of police officers, game 
wardens and local residents have been searching for Ayla since she was 
reported missing by her father, Justin DiPietro, on the morning of 
December 17. Massey said a report about the case on the Fox network 
television program 'America's Most Wanted' during the weekend generated 
some leads, which are being checked by police.

DiPietro told investigators he last 
saw Ayla when he put her to bed the night before at his home in 
Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state
capital, Augusta.

Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told police he last saw Ayla, right, when he put her to bed last Friday night. He said she was wearing green pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

My mom: Ayla, right, ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme

He said she was wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them and had a cast on her broken left arm.

'That is the last place Ayla was seen. So as you might expect, we're going to give a lot of attention to that particular house'

Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey

Ayla ended up with her father after 
child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, 
checked herself into a 10-day rehabilitation program.

Reynolds, who completed the rehab, 
had filed court papers that she said she hoped would lead to the return 
of her daughter. The filing came the day before Ayla was last seen.

Appearing on the Today show last week, Reynolds said she blames DiPietro for their daughter's disappearance.

Sadness: Isaiah Vear, 5, of Waterville, Maine, leaves a memorial after placing a toy for missing 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds outside the toddler's home on Thursday in Waterville

Address: Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey, at the podium, speaks to members of the media regarding the investigation into the disappearance of 20 month-old Ayla Reynolds at a conference in Waterville, Maine

'I trusted him to keep her safe,' she said.

'And now she is missing and I don't 
know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way
he was supposed to.'

DiPietro has said he has 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.'

'I will not make accusations or 
insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove 
who's responsible for this,' he said.

He said last week his family and friends would do 'everything we can to assist in this investigation and get Ayla back home.'
