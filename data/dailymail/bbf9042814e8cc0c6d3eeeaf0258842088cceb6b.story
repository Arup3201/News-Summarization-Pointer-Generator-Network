A girl thrown from a plane that crashed at San Francisco International Airport died before she was twice run over by fire trucks, according to a report issued by the city.

It directly contradicts a coroner's finding that the teen survived the crash and was killed by the fire vehicles.

Instead, the city said in a report obtained Wednesday that 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan died when she hit the ground after she was thrown from the back of an Asiana jet that had its tail ripped off.

The conclusion was contained in a report the city filed with the National Transportation Safety Board. City officials say it is based on NTSB reports and interviews by federal investigators; the city did not conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts.

‘We did our examination and we determined that the young lady was alive when she was struck by the fire trucks,’ said San Mateo County coroner Robert Foucrault. ‘The death certificate says what it says. If someone wants to put a spin on something, they can do that.’

No one disputes that Ye Meng Yuan, 16, was found dead on the ground after being thrown out the back of an Asiana Airlines jet airliner that crashed at San Francisco International Airport last summer. And there's agreement she was hit, twice, by fire trucks rushing to the scene.

But a few weeks after the accident, Foucrault announced that the autopsy was complete and that she had been alive when she was hit, saying there was internal hemorrhaging that indicated her heart was still beating when the truck struck her.

Only three of the 307 people aboard 
the jet died in the dramatic crash that sent the Boeing 777 tumbling 
across the tarmac with its tail torn off.

The
 conclusion that she did not survive the initial crash was contained in a
 report the city filed with the National Transportation Safety Board in 
January. City officials say they based their findings solely on NTSB 
reports and interviews by federal investigators; the city did not 
conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts.

The
 city said in its document that neither of two NTSB reports noted dust, 
dirt, debris or firefighting foam in Meng Yuan's trachea or lung 
tissues. The city also said that NTSB investigators found she had not 
buckled her seatbelt for the landing, based on interviews with survivors
 and an inspection that found her seatbelt attached and unbuckled.

Families of Meng Yuan and the two other victims have filed a claim against the city saying emergency workers were incompetent.

Their attorney Gretchen Nelson said lawyers reviewed the city's findings about the death ‘and we do not agree.’

The
 city's report, prepared by airport and fire department officials, is 
one of hundreds of documents the NTSB will review before concluding its 
accident investigation.

Some
 of those NTSB documents describe how after the crash, Meng Yuan was 
struck twice by emergency vehicles on the runway — once by a fire rig 
spraying foam and again 11 minutes later by a second truck that was 
turning around to fetch water.

Firefighters
 told authorities she appeared to be dead — she was covered with dust, 
silent, not moving — so they raced on toward the fire. The NTSB records 
included some excerpts from the coroner's report but no information 
about when or how the girl died.

San
 Francisco airport spokesman Doug Yakel said officials with the facility
 didn't intend to dispute the coroner's conclusion but had depended 
solely on NTSB records to conclude the girl had died when she hit the 
ground.

NTSB spokesman 
Keith Holloway said agency officials do not put personal information 
such as causes of death in their public files, but San Francisco 
officials could have looked at the coroner's reports.

Aviation
 attorney Ron Goldman, whose firm is suing the airline and aircraft 
manufacturer on behalf of 14 survivors, said city officials are trying 
to avoid hefty payouts and are not going to admit anything in public 
records that could later be used against them.

‘The
 city has an ax to grind here because their liability could hang in the 
balance of whether she was already dead or whether she was alive and 
they failed to move her to a safe place,’ Goldman said.David Levine,
 a law professor at University of California's Hastings College of the 
Law, said the city attorney's document is one party's version of what 
happened.

The city says two
 things, Levine said: The girl was dead when she was run over. And even 
if she wasn't dead, it's not the city's fault because things were so 
chaotic and dangerous when she was struck that no reasonable jury or 
judge could blame the city.

‘If
 you believe the city's report, damages are going to be zero,’ Levine 
said. ‘If you believe the coroner, the family is entitled to millions.’

Levine
 said there's no surprise the city would try to cast the best possible 
light on itself and its performance that day and not concede any 
liability. From afar, Levine thinks it will be difficult to prove where 
the girl's fatal injuries came from — the plane or fire trucks.

The
 way she died doesn't ease the emotional trauma at the San Francisco 
Fire Department, where firefighters were shaken after rescuers drove 
over Meng Yuan two times, spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Wednesday.

‘It doesn't make it better or worse, really,’ she said. ‘It's just psychologically, it's a difficult thing. Period.’
