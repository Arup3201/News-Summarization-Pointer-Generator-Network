A 16-year-old girl was allegedly beaten by other girls before being held down to be raped in a horrifying attack that was filmed on a cellphone, it was revealed today. 

Patricia Montes, 15, and 16-year-old Erica Avery are accused of punching, kicking and pepper-spraying the girl before holding her down to be raped by Jayvon Woolfork, 19, police said. 

The barbaric attack was filmed on a cell phone by Lanel Singleton, 18, and shows the girl writhing half naked and weeping in the yard of a home in Hollywood, Florida while her attackers leer over her.

Along with 17-year-old Dwight Henry, the alleged rape gang have all been charged in the attack on November 1 last year.

The sickening clips, shown by CBS Miami for the first time today, shows the girls viciously beating the girl while the men watch.

One male voice can be heard saying: 'They don't like this girl.'

One
 girl responds: 'I told you we were gonna f*** somebody up'.

As the 
victim begs to be freed, another girl says they should 'let this girl go
 home' but the attack continues.

Inside the home, the alleged attackers dragged the victim into a room and pinned her down while Woolfork assaulted her.

The
 victim is later allowed to leave but not before one of her female 
attackers spits on her. She managed to flag down a car and make it to 
her home where she fell unconscious and was taken to hospital. She spent
 several days in hospital with broken bones in her face, swelling and 
being unable to see.

The victim told police that she was attacked after smoking marijuana and drinking beer with people she believed to be her friends, including one girl who had been her best friend since kindergarten.

Patricia Montes, 15, and 
Erica Avery, 16, are charged with two counts each of felony armed sexual
 assault and kidnapping. Both have been charged as adults.

Henry, 17, of 
Hollywood; Lanel Singleton, 18, of North Miami; and Woolfork, 19, all 
face charges of capital felony sexual assault and kidnapping.

All have pleaded not guilty and are being held on bond with the exception of Montes.

Singleton, who is believed to have recorded the clips, was expected to appear in court today.

At a bail hearing in November, prosecutor Maria Schneider described the 
video of the crime, detailing how the victim pleaded with the alleged attackers to stop 
as she held her arms over her face to protect herself from their 
unrelenting blows.

‘The 
cruelty shown on this video . . . this was repeated over and over again 
. . . The girls are trying to remove her bra. You saw the victim sitting
 on the toilet crying, her face blown up and swollen from injuries, and 
then they beat her,’ Ms Schneider said.

During
 parts of the three-hour bail hearing, Avery grinned and rolled her eyes
 and had to be admonished by her lawyer to remain composed. Montes, who 
was the victim’s best friend, appeared stoic for most of the proceeding.

The victim claims that she 
was kicked, thrown down stairs and had her face smashed on concrete, 
breaking bones near both her eyes.

The judge said: 'This 16-year-old woman, both of her eyes were closed from
 being beaten, she had blood coming from one of her ears.'

The videos, consisting of 11 snippets, show the victim being beaten, but they do not depict sexual activity.

Erica Avery, 16, and Patricia Montes, 15. Like the three other defendants, Avery and Montes are charged with two counts each of armed sexual battery and kidnapping stemming from the Nov. 1 assault
