Three police officers have been placed on paid leave after a 17-year-old girl with a history of mental illness was shot dead in the lobby of a Texas police station 

Kristina Coignard entered the lobby of the police station in Longview on Thursday evening and used an assistance phone to tell a communications employees she needed an officer. 

Officers responded to the lobby and 'were confronted by a white female who threatened them'.

Coignard then 'brandished a weapon and 'made threatening movements'. She was shot four times. 

Kristina Coignard, 17,  was shot dead after entering the lobby of the police station in Longview, Texas and 'brandishing a weapon'. It is believed that she had a knife 

After Coignard was shot four times in the station on Thursday (pictured), three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave on Friday

She was brought to Good Shepherd Medical Center and pronounced dead by a Justice of the Peace.

Texas Department of Public Safety officials have declined to identify the weapon, but Longview Mayor Jay Dean was told a 'female wielding a knife entered into the police department', according to the Marshall News Messenger. 

Three Longview police officers were placed on paid leave after the shooting and the Texas Rangers were called in to investigate the incident.

Coignard was living with her aunt, Heather Robertson, before her death. 

Robertson said her niece had been battling mental illness, including bipolar disorder and depression, and that the teenager had been hospitalized twice following suicide attempts,Think Progress reported. 

She said Coignard 'was only violent with herself' and has questions about what happened.

'I think it was a cry for help. I think they could have done something.'

'They are grown men. I think there is something they are not telling us.'

Coignard's aunt said her niece was struggling with mental illness but she was 'only violent to herself'

Officials from the Longview Police Department have confirmed there is a video of the shooting.

The station did close after the incident, but it has been re-opened. 

Longview police officers were involved in two shootings last year. A 15-year-old boy was killed in one and a 23-year-old man was killed in the other. 

Officers in both 2014 cases were cleared by a grand jury. 

The Longview Police Department has been using its Facebook page to release updates about the shooting and the investigation. 

Some people have been leaving inappropriate comments  and the department issued a reminder that the page is not a forum to 'bash others, their education, or life experiences.'

More information should be on the way soon:

'Once the investigation is complete the Texas Rangers and/or the Gregg County District Attorney will release further information about this incident and then everyone will be able to have the information available to make a decision that can be more accurate than what they would be able to make based on the limited information furnished at this time.'

Jason Robertson, who identified himself as Coignard's uncle, wrote:

'I am the uncle of Kristiana, for quite a few years my niece suffered from mental illness. 

'It hurt to see all the comments said about her. 

'They didn't know that she had these problems, seeing her berated by quite a few people has hurt me and my family. 

'I please ask that you pray for my family and not judge her for what she had done. 

'She is now in a better place with her mother. Thank You.'
