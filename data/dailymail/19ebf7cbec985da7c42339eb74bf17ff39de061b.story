With her marriage crumbling, and embroiled in a furious argument with her husband over breakfast, Julie Evans grabbed the nearest weapon to hand.

And yesterday the 45-year-old found herself in court admitting assault with a piece of toast... and a smear of butter for good measure.

The court heard how she grabbed a handful of Clover and rubbed it over her husband James during the breakfast bust-up after he told her he wanted a divorce.

Things turned ugly as the husband and 
wife of 15 years continued their clash amid the foodstuffs, after which 
Mr Evans was left with a bleeding ear that needed 13 stitches, the court
 heard.

Describing the 
fracas which took place last July at their home in Drybrook, 
Gloucestershire, Evans told the court: ‘He came down to breakfast and 
said “I want a divorce. Get out of this f****** house.”

‘That did annoy me and I did throw toast at him. I did put butter in his face.’

She added: ‘I went to wash the butter off my hands and he came to put butter on my face. I pushed him back.

‘He
 grabbed me around the throat. I grabbed a cup to defend myself and 
eventually he let me go and I fell on the floor. He noticed his ear was 
bleeding.’

Evans, who has since divorced her husband, also admitted pouring water on him as he slept the previous day.

Telling
 his version of events to Cheltenham magistrates’ court, Mr Evans, a 
40-year-old project manager, said: ‘I came into the kitchen and said 
“good morning”.

‘She threw 
the toast at me. I laughed so she grabbed a handful of butter and 
smeared it all over my face. I tried to rub the butter on her back to 
make her laugh. I tried to make it playful.

‘I went to get the butter out of my hair when she grabbed me by the throat.’

Mr
 Evans said he put his hand under his wife’s chin to make her let go. He
 said he thought she was tugging his hair but could not tell because he 
has multiple sclerosis which affects his sense of touch.

At this point the couple’s 14-year-old daughter entered the kitchen, and Mr Evans noticed blood on the floor.

‘My ear was flapping in the wind. It was in two halves,’ Mr Evans said. ‘I don’t know how it got like that. I can’t remember.’

Evans
 admitted two charges of common assault for pouring water on her husband
 and for the breakfast attack, but was cleared of actual bodily harm to 
his ear.

She was told to pay £300 in fines, as well as £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

Magistrate
 Chris Summers said: ‘There was growing tension in this relationship. 
This culminated in a fracas. Ms Evans’s response to Mr Evans’s 
aggression was  in self-defence.’
