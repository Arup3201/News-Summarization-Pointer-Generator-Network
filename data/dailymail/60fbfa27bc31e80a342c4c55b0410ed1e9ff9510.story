A young woman has escaped injury after a hit-and-run driver smashed into her car while she was taking her driving test.

The student, who has not been named, was taking her first test in rush-hour traffic when the accident happened. The test was abandoned and police were called.

Officers said the collision happened on the roundabout near the Asda supermarket in Bradford Road, Brackenhall, West Yorkshire, at 8.32am on Friday.

The student set off on her test at 8.10am but just 12 minutes later the exam was stopped as another motorist rammed into her instructor's car before running off

Holmfirth-based driving instructor Dave Reilly had dropped the student at Huddersfield Test Centre for the first test of the day at 8.10am.

She was driving a new automatic Hyundai i20 - which costs £8,695 - bought by Mr Reilly just two weeks ago.

Mr Reilly said his student was shocked but unhurt. It is believed the examiner, a woman, suffered slight neck injuries.

Mr Reilly said: 'I can’t believe what has happened and I am just glad no one was seriously injured. I was back at the test centre so I don’t know what happened.

The new Hyundai i20, which costs £8,695, had been bought by driving instructor Dave Reilly just two weeks before

Pete Tiernan, chairman of Huddersfield Driving Instructors' Association, said the test would not count against the girl

'I’ve been a driving instructor for 11 years and helped around 200 people pass their tests. I’ve got a 20-year no claims bonus. Nothing like this has happened to me before.

Mr Reilly was still waiting to hear how much damage had been caused to his car but a replacement vehicle would keep him on the road.

It is understood the examiner rang police on the student’s mobile phone.

Pete Tiernan, chairman of Huddersfield Driving Instructors’ Association, said driving test accidents were rare but he knew of another one in Huddersfield just four or five months ago.

On that occasion a white van hit a student’s car.

Mr Tiernan said the abandoned test would not count against the student and said it would be recorded as a ‘non-fault test’.
