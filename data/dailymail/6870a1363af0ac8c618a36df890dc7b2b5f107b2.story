Deputies from Orange County Sheriff's Office were called to the Kissimmee resort shortly after 2pm on Wednesday.

Inspection officers found possible code violations of the water feature.

Electrical breakers were improperly placed.

A statement released by the sheriff's office said: 'During her game [of miniature golf], the victim's golf ball fell into a small pond that is located inside the golf area.

'When the victim attempted to retrieve her ball from the pond, she screamed as if she was in distress.

'Another guest, Christopher Burges, who was also in the golf area, heard the screaming and attempted to rescue her.

'Mr Burges was unable to rescue the child as he suffered an injury as well.'

Police named the girl and said she had died after being taken to Celebration Hospital.

Resort guests told WESH 2 News that hotel
workers had informed them the girl had been electrocuted and the sheriff's office confirmed that was one of the possible causes being investigated.

Ashton was reportedly on holiday with her family.
