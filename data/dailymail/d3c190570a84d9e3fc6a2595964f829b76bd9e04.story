We’ve seen the vampire facial and Botox is old news - so what are women now doing to turn back the clock in their desperate quest for youth?

The latest anti-ageing treatment taking the cosmetic industry by storm is the ‘puppet facelift’, which experts claim can help women beat wrinkles without going under the knife. 

Earning its nickname from the use of strings, or threads, to lift and volumise the cheeks and lower face, the puppet facelift is proving popular with women in their 30s seeking to reduce the first signs of ageing.

Former beauty queen, Rachel Howard, 34,   before (left) and after (right), says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence, making her happier and feeling more feminine

Indeed, the non-surgical treatment, which costs £1,650, saw a 1,065 per cent rise in enquiries at the start of the year.

The treatment takes an hour or two and involves ‘strings’ being threaded through the face, under the skin to lift the muscles on the face.

Speaking about the cosmetic craze, Dr Sarah Tonks at Knightsbridge-based medical spa, Omniya London, said: 'The puppet facelift has been gaining popularity at a rapid rate, particularly with ladies in their 30s - and with good reason. 

'Our 30s represent a transitional time, particularly for women. While the skin isn’t sagging enough to warrant a surgical facelift, the signs of ageing have started to set in - particularly around the jaw and cheeks.

'The thread lift can help improve the appearance of skin laxity, giving patients a more volumised look.'

Dr Tonks explains that the treatment offers patients a subtle facial lift that looks natural, meaning they avoid the ‘wind tunnel’ look often associated with surgical facelifts.

'It makes  them look refreshed rather than different,' she added. 'No one wants to look like they’ve had work done, especially in their 30s, so this treatment offers the best solution.

'It could be the end of the scalpel - the results are that good.'

Former beauty queen, Rachel Howard, 34, who was crowned Miss UK in 2012, underwent a puppet lift last year. She says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence, making her happier and feeling more feminine. 

'Like many women my age, I found the transition into my early 30s a distressing time,' she explained.

'Being a former beauty queen, I’m very aware of my looks and ageing, and when I started to see the skin around my eyes becoming lax, making me look like I had eye bags, I decided to approach a professional for help. 

'Dr Tonks recommended I try it and it’s changed my life. The idea of the "puppet lift" is quite strange to start with, especially when you see the strings poking through the skin.

'But it lifts the muscles and skin making sure the face looks fresher but avoids the "overdone" look I associate with plastic surgery and facelifts.

'I look and feel more youthful, and I love that my family and friends keep asking me how I look so fresh, rather than asking me what I’ve had done.'

Under local anaesthetic, the threads - made of an extra-strong polymer and inserted with a fine needle at  the hairline around the temples - are  attached at the jowls and the folds that run from the nose to the corner of the mouth.

There may be bruising or swelling in the days after the treatment and patients are advised not to smile for a week or so to let the threads settle. 

The body's scar tissue  keeps the threads in place and results are effective for five to seven years.

Carole Brennan, meanwhile, is one of the clinic's older clients.

The 57-year-old from London underwent the non-surgical facelift after being scared to opt for surgery.

'I came to Dr. Tonks last year when I started to feel gradually more unhappy with the sagging skin on my face and my eye bags,' she said.

'I felt like my face was ageing me, but I didn’t feel a facelift was the right option for me. The idea of scalpels and invasive surgery made me shudder, but  the idea of threads  sounded perfect for me.

'Before the treatment I looked like I was in my 60s or worse, but now I’ve had people say I don’t look a day over 45. 

'My confidence has never been higher, and I feel like a new woman - this treatment turned back the clock ten years for me.'
