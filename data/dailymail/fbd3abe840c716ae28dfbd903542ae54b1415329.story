Arrest: Idowu Daramola, 48, was allegedly talking on his phone when he caused a deadly crash

The bus driver who lost control of his vehicle, causing it to smash into a lamppost which crushed an eight-month-old girl to death in her stroller was on his cellphone at the time, police believe.

Idowu Daramola, 48, from Thornwood, New York, was charged with death by auto, reckless driving and using a cellphone while operating a vehicle after the death of little Angela Paredes on Tuesday.

His alleged mindlessness sparked a terrifying - and ultimate deadly - chain reaction; his bus struck the lamppost, then a tree, another lamppost and a parked car, which hit three other parked cars.

Seven people were sent to hospitals - including four in one of the cars - and authorities desperately tried to save Angela as her mother, Maylin Hogo could do nothing but scream helplessly.

'I heard a loud crash and people 
screaming,' said Iris Pizarro, who lives in an apartment building across
the street. 'That's when I ran to the window and saw the mother over 
the baby screaming, "My daughter! My baby!'"

Juan Navarrrete said he heard the crash and the mother’s screams from his 21st floor apartment.

Innocence: Officers ran to give the little girl CPR after she was crushed but they were unable to save her

As he rushed down to help, he watched as Officer Michael Stetson administered CPR on the bloodied infant.

‘That officer worked so hard,’ Navarrrete told the Jersey Journal. ‘He was trying to keep her alive.’

Stetson said the baby had no pulse when he arrived and began the resuscitation efforts - which very nearly worked.

‘After CPR, she was gasping every third breath,’ said Stetson, a father of three himself.

As Naverrete watched the calamity unfold, he said he broke down.

‘You don't know the person, but that's a human being,’ he told Jersey Journal. ‘I really cried over there.’

Freak accident: While Angela's mother pushed her stroller down the street, a bus careened into a nearby lamppost which then fell on Angela, killing her

Cause unknown: The cause of the accident is unknown and Angela was the only casualty. A witness said the bus dropped off passengers and then suddenly sped off before crashing into the light post and a nearby car

Witness
Jose Serra said he watched as the bus dropped off passengers and then 
seemed to suddenly sped out of control, hitting a parked car after 
crashing into the lamppost.

Four people from one of the parked cars were taken away to be treated for minor injuries.

The grieving mother and bus driver were both taken to Jersey City Medical Center in neck braces, along with the child.

Speaking through hospital officials, 
Angela’s father Jairo Paredes and the rest of her family declined to 
speak to the press, the Jersey Journal reported.

The
vehicle was operated by Sphinx Transportation, which provides shuttle 
service between New Jersey and New York City, just across the Hudson 
River from West New York.

Distraught: Angela's mother was unhurt, though she was taken from the scene in a neck brace. The family, including father Jairo Paredes (right) declined to speak to reporters Tuesday

'It's a human tragedy': West New York Mayor Felix Roque spoke to reporters on the scene 'It's sad.'

A
woman who answered the telephone at the Sphinx offices in Ridgefield 
told The Associated Press the company had no idea what caused the 
accident, and that the driver had been hospitalized.

'I'm not shocked at all that it was one 
of these drivers,' resident Yorvira Kavanaugh said. 'They're always on 
their phones, always arguing with each other. Sometimes they pull up 
next to each other and argue about passengers.'

Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari said driver distraction, along with speed, may have been factors in the crash.

Schillari
said his office is working with the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office 
Homicide Unit to investigate the cause of the tragedy.

Accused: Idowu Daramola, pictured left and right with his wife, was also charged with reckless driving

No comment: The driver of the bus is now being questioned by authorities. An employee of the bus company--Sphinx, which runs between New York and New Jersey--declined to comment

Daramola also had two outstanding 
warrants for picking up or discharging passengers in an unauthorized 
area, according to sheriff's office spokesman Mike Makarski.

West New York Mayor Felix Roque was on the scene and spoke to reporters.

‘It's a human tragedy to have this kind of event in West New York,’ he said. ‘It's sad.’

On Wednesday morning, lit candles, teddy 
bears and flowers were placed at a makeshift memorial as utility crews 
worked to reinstall the light pole.
