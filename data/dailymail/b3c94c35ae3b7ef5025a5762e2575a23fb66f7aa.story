Southampton secured their first win at Old Trafford in 27 years as they saw off an out-of-sorts Manchester United side on Sunday.

Dusan Tadic scored the only goal of the game - just six minutes after coming off the bench - to secure a memorable away day for the Saints.

Here, Sportsmail assesses how each player has performed.

MANCHESTER UNITED (3-5-2)

David de Gea  - 6

The Spaniard didn't have much to do but could do nothing to stop the Saints' winner as Tadic struck the ball home with aplomb.

Chris Smalling - 6

Made a number of crucial interceptions for the hosts in the first half. But was caught sleeping for the all-important winner.

Phil Jones  - 6

Wasn't his worst performance of the season but did nothing to stand out.

Daley Blind - 6 

After a quiet first half the Dutchman was better after the break, but it wasn't one of his finest games. 

Antonio Valencia - 6

Put in a few inviting crosses into the box for the hosts but nothing came of it. One of United's better performers though.

Juan Mata endured a frustrating afternoon for United - missing two golden opportunities in the closing stages

Juan Mata - 5

Looked lively at times but crucially missed two golden opportunities to level proceedings in the closing stages for United - lacking any kind of composure. Another frustrating day for the Spaniard.

Michael Carrick - 6

United's Mr Reliable had a quiet game by his usual standards as Southampton bossed the midfield.

Luke Shaw - 5

The 19-year-old faced Southampton for the first time since leaving the club, but flattered to deceive before being replaced by Tyler Blackett.

Angel di Maria - 5

Always eager to get on the ball and produce something. One of his quieter afternoons though. 

Wayne Rooney - 6

As always was United's workhouse, but failed to spark anything of real note for the hosts.

Robin van Persie - 5

Anonymous throughout for the hosts before appearing to limp off the field on the hour mark. 

SUBSTITUTES

Ander Herrera (on for Van Persie, 60) - 6

Showed some nice touches after coming on but didn't really get into the game otherwise.

Marouane Fellaini (on for Di Maria, 72) - 5

Was brought on to be an aerial threat for the hosts, but had no real joy with the Saints defence dealing with everything that was thrown at them.  

Tyler Blackett (on for Shaw, 64) - 5

Came on to fill the void at left back for the unimpressive Shaw.

SUBS NOT USED:

Victor Valdes (GK), Jonny Evans, Paddy McNair, James Wilson.

MANAGER

Louis Van Gaal - 5 

A bad day at the office for Van Gaal against a familiar face in the shape of Ronald Koeman.

SOUTHAMPTON (4-3-3) 

Fraser Forster - 6

Didn't have a great amount to deal with in the Southampton goal, but looked shaky on a couple of occasions.

Nathaniel Clyne - 7

The right-back's rampaging run and shot inside the first minute could and probably should have given the visitors the lead. Improving game-by-game.

Jose Fonte - 9

Had already won on his international debut for Portugal on the same ground earlier this season  and history repeated itself on Sunday. Brilliant performance from the experienced centre half.

Toby Alderweireld - 6

The Belgian was forced off injured after just 20 minutes for the Saints and after a shaky period immediately after, the Saints' defence shored things up admirably in his absence.

Ryan Bertrand - 7

The former Chelsea left back put in another solid display for the visitors.

Steven Davis - 7 

Really stepped up his game after the break. A good performance from the midfielder. 

Victor Wanyama - 7

 A solid performance from the former Celtic midfielder in the heart of the Saints midfield.

Morgan Schneiderlin, pictured challenging for the ball with Wayne Rooney, was outstanding throughout

Morgan Schneiderlin - 9

You can see exactly why the Frenchman is so highly regarded after yet another excellent performance. Imperious in the middle of the park for the visitors. 

Eljero Elia - 6

The Dutch winger put in a solid display on his  Saints debut before being replaced by Tadic.

James Ward-Prowse - 8

Done a sterling job limiting the impact of Carrick in the first half in particular. Another good display from the youngster.

Graziano Pelle - 7

Anonymous in the first half but was much better after the break and was involved in the all-important goal, as his shot rebounded off the post leaving Tadic to tap the ball home from close range.

SUBSTITUTES

Florin Gardos (on for Alderweireld, 20) - 7

Done a decent job after replacing the injured Belgian early on.

Dusan Tadic (on for Elia, 63) - 7

Showed real composure to slot the ball home from close range after Pelle had hit the post.

Harrison Reed (on for Davis, 80) - 6

The youngster didn't put a foot wrong after coming off the bench late on.

SUBS NOT USED: 

Kelvin Davis (GK), Shane Long, Lloyd Isgrove,  Matt Targett.

MANAGER  

Ronald Koeman - 9

The Dutchman masterminded a stunning 1-0 win for the Saints against former foe Van Gaal. Southampton's midfield totally bossed proceedings from start to finish.
