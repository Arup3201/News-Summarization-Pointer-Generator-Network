Manuel Pellegrini admitted that his Manchester City players were mentally shattered by Sunday’s defeat at Liverpool after their title hopes were dealt another devastating blow by bottom-of the-table Sunderland on Wednesday night.

The City boss refused to give up the chase as his team slipped to third favourites behind Liverpool and Chelsea following the shock 2-2 home draw - three days after losing at Anfield. Only a late slip by Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone, letting in Samir Nasri’s 88th-minute equaliser, spared them another defeat.

Pellegrini admitted: ‘We couldn’t take the Liverpool game out of our minds. It was very difficult for the players to do that after three days. At this moment it is more mental than physical. Mentally it was very difficult to play this game after Liverpool. We needed more intensity but our minds maybe were not right to do it.

‘We had a low performance at the beginning of February but after that we recovered and have had very good results until we lost against Liverpool.’

Pellegrini will try to summon the spirit of 2012, when City came from behind to beat Manchester United to the title on goal difference on the final day of the season, adding: ‘This team two years ago were six points behind the leaders and won the title at the end. We have five games more to play, we must try to win the games and we’ll see at the end of the season which team has more points.

‘Maybe at this moment Liverpool and Chelsea have the better chance because of our position but we will keep fighting until the last day of the season.

‘My duty is to talk with the players and try to win the last five games. Before this match I was very worried. To play against a relegated team at the end of the season is always very difficult because they fight for every ball.’

The result left City six points behind Liverpool with a game in hand, the same gap that separates Sunderland from safety at the foot of the table as they prepare to visit Chelsea.

‘It’s one more blow,’ said manager Gus Poyet. ‘I tell you what, I’m testing my heart this year. Every week. I’m realistic and I’m not going to change now. We played a great game.

‘I thought for a few minutes we were going to get all three points, but we didn’t because of an incredible moment again. Mannone has been outstanding and we need him for Saturday.’
