Lack of sleep could double the signs of skin ageing, including fine lines, claim researchers.

A US study shows the skin of women who were poor sleepers showed accelerated signs of age and was slower to recover from damage such as sunburn.

Women who slept badly were also more likely to rate themselves as unattractive.

Side effects: Not getting enough restorative sleep can age skin and make it slow to repair

Dr Elma Baron, director of the Skin Study Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, said: ‘Sleep-deprived women show signs of premature skin ageing and a decrease in their skin’s ability to recover after sun exposure.’

The study analysed 60 women aged 30 to 49, with half not getting enough sleep. Scientists used tests such as UV light exposure to check for moisture loss – a sign of poor skin quality.

Those who had insufficient sleep showed increased signs of skin ageing, with an average score of 4.4 – double the 2.2 average for good sleepers. This means those who slept badly had more fine lines, uneven skin colour and slackening of skin.

The differences were statistically significant, says the study, commissioned by Estee Lauder.

Slow recovery: Skin damage can take longer to heal if women have not slept enough

The researchers found good sleepers repaired skin damage more quickly and they were  more likely to rate themselves  as attractive.

Dr Baron said: ‘While chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to medical problems such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and immune deficiency, its effects on skin function have previously been unknown.’

Dr Daniel Yarosh, of Basic Science Research at Estee Lauder, said: ‘This research shows for the first time that poor sleep quality can accelerate signs of skin ageing and weaken the skin’s ability to repair itself at night.’
