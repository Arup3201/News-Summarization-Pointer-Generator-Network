Middlesbrough have been something of a forgotten club in recent seasons.

Relegated from the Premier League in 2009, chairman Steve Gibson reinvested parachute payments only for the team never to take flight.

Indeed, they have remained grounded in the nowhere regions of the second tier. Until now.

Middlesbrough take on Liverpool in the Capital One Cup third round on Tuesday... and they are up for a shock

With three wins on the spin – taking them to within three points of top – they are one of the country’s form sides and, on Tuesday evening, they will remind a national audience of their existence with a televised trip to Anfield in the League Cup.

So what’s going on down by the Riverside? Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look…

The past five seasons sound forgettable, what happened?

It’s more of a case of what failed to happen. Gareth Southgate should have gone in the wake of relegation but Gibson kept faith. It was a mistake and by October Gordon Strachan was installed with the remit of taking Boro back to the Premier League. And so began the Scottish revolution.

They may have voted against independence last week, but Strachan set about creating an independent Scottish state on Teesside.

By the end of the 2010 winter window five of his compatriots had arrived at significant cost. But Strachan never seemed happy back in the dugout and he was replaced after a year by fan favourite Tony Mowbray.

Neither Gareth Southgate or Tony Mowbray managed to bring success back to Middlesbrough

Gordon Strachan brought in a Scottish legion but also struggled at the Riverside

His popularity bought him time – too much of it, in fact. For Mowbray remained in charge for three laborious years during which the club stalled.

Enter, last November, Aitor Karanka.

I remember him from Championship Manager with Real Madrid?

We’re sure he’ll be thrilled by such recollection… but yes, while Real were winning three Champions League trophies around the turn of the millennium, Karanka was an unsung stalwart in defence.

He went on to manage Spain Under 16s before returning to Madrid as assistant to Jose Mourinho.

And so to Middlesbrough, how has he done?

He may lack the charisma of his close pal Jose, but Karanka is proving a canny coach. Boro won six from eight at the back end of last season to suggest his influence was beginning to take hold and a busy summer followed during which the Spaniard stamped his mark on the squad.

How busy was the summer then?

Well, total turnover amounted to a staggering 27, broken down by; seven signings, five loans in, 11 released or sold and four loans out.

This, then, is Karanka’s team.

The Spaniard has changed the team dramatically but is beginning to pick up points in the Championship

How have they done?

They certainly don’t do draws and are one of only two sides in the country not to tie a game this season.

Three wins from three – the latest an emphatic 4-0 thrashing of Brentford – has lifted them to play-off territory and Karanka believes that is where they should remain, rather than play catch-up like they did last term only to fall short in 12th.

Who are the stars?

Who aren’t the stars? For be it new signings or those from previous regimes, Boro are bouncing all over the park.

Spanish forward Kike has been the pick of the summer arrivals. Karanka worked with the 24-year-old at international youth level and his £2.7million acquisition is proving something of a coup.

The silky Spaniard has netted five times already, his latest effort a sumptuous scoop in the demolition of Brentford.

Kike could prove to be a snip at £2.7million, he is already banging in the goals

Captain Grant Leadbitter has been the main man this season, already scoring seven goals from midfield

But it is captain Grant Leadbitter who has been the main man this season. If he’s not scoring belters from 30 yards then, well, he’s scoring belters from 25 yards. The former Sunderland and Ipswich schemer has smashed seven goals to already better his tally from last term. His honesty and endeavour from the centre of midfield will be the heartbeat to any potential promotion push.

But Boro have options all over the pitch and team selection is a welcome headache for Karanka right now, certainly in attack where Kike is competing with Belgium forward Jelle Vossen, Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford, Emilio Nsue and Lee Tomlin.

They also have the chairman's nephew at the back, England Under 21 defender Ben Gibson. 

What about that connection with Chelsea?

Yes, Karanka has made full use of his relationship with Mourinho to bring in Football League goal machine Bamford, defender Kenneth Omeruo and goalkeeper Jamal Blackman on loan.

But it was Spurs loanee Ryan Fredericks who caught the eye most impressively at the weekend, coming in for his debut and putting in a combative yet classy display.

Patrick Bamford is one of many talented Chelsea loanees who have been brought in by Karanka

So can they shock Liverpool?

Yes. They’ve won their last three away from home, are in free-scoring form and Karanka has generated a healthy competition whereby those who come in will be desperate to impress.

Middlesbrough Football Club – forgotten no more.
