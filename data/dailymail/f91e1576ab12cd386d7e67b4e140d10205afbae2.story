Alan Pardew described it as ‘one of the best moments of his career’ when he scored the winner for Crystal Palace against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final. 

And on Monday night, Pardew was given the chance to repeat his heroics, this time as Palace manager, when his side were drawn at home to Liverpool or Bolton in the fifth round.

Palace’s victory in 1990 was made all the more remarkable by the fact they were beaten 9-0 at Anfield in the league just seven months previously.

Sadly for Palace, they could not repeat the trick in the final, losing after a replay to Manchester United - a triumph that gave Sir Alex Ferguson his first trophy at Old Trafford.

Pardew has won all four games as Eagles manager since leaving Newcastle for Selhurst Park at the start of January.

Palace defeated Dover in the third round of the FA Cup in Pardew's first match before beating Southampton 3-2 on Saturday in the fourth round of the competition.

The 53-year-old also masterminded a 2-1 victory home at London rivals Tottenham and a 3-2 win against Burnley at Turf Moor.
