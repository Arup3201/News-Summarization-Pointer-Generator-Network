An oak tree has gone back to its roots - 200 years after it was taken to the other side of the world.

As locals emigrated to Australia in the 19th century they took with them acorns from an oak tree in Holme-On-Spalding-Moor, East Yorkshire.

When they settled, the seeds were planted in the families' own little corner of England.

And now a sapling grown from an acorn from one of the trees nurtured in Australia has been planted back in the village where the 20,000-mile cross-generational round-trip began.

What a family tree! The acorn taken from the tree in Australia (pictured) has returned home 200 years later as a sapling

Digging in: Aleck Brown, 6, and younger sister Katy, 3, plant the sapling in the same village where it was originally taken from

The journey was prompted after someone read a book about people from East Yorkshire moving to all corners of the earth.

The tree's story begins in the 1820s 
when the British Government offered land for settlers to populate 
Western Australia fearing the French might try to land there.

The call was answered by a tiny group of farmers from northern England including the Clarksons family from Yorkshire Holme House.

In 1829 the Clarksons and 37 other passengers set sail from Hull on the ship The Tranby destined for a new life - accompanying a handful of acorns from a tree growing on the family farm.

The seeds survived despite being crammed onto a tiny ship for an eight month journey and they even dodged a meteor strike that struck the ship, before eventually being planted by the settlers in their new home.

Now 183 years later saplings from the trees those acorns became at the settler's new Australian home have come all the way back again - and they've been planted by the grandson and granddaughter of the family who now live in Holme House.

At Holme-On-Spalding-Moor Primary school Aleck Brown, six, and his young sister three-year-old Katy had the honour of planting the extraordinary sapling.

Aleck and Katy's grandparents Michael and Pat Rhodes live at Holme House, the place where the original tree still stands where the acorns came from.

The amazing journey has come full-circle thanks to someone in Australia seeing a book written by Dr Robb Robinson called Far Horizons - From Hull to the Ends of the Earth.

Dr Robinson, from the University of Hull, said he wrote the book to chart the stories of people leaving Hull for other parts of the world and one of the stories was about the fabled acorns.

He said: 'Around the 1820s the British government were worried the French might settle western Australia as we didn't have many people living there.

'They issued a call in all the national newspapers asking for settlers who would be willing to go there.

'It was a big risk, they had to take all their farming equipment and livestock and if had to arrive before January 1831 to guarantee them a plot of land.

'The Clarksons were just one of the family's who left from East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire on an 87-foot-long ship, The Tranby.

Branching out: The tree, which has flourished in Australia, was grown when a family packed up and emigrated in the 1800s

'It was an eight month journey to Australia with around 37 passengers and 14 crew along there was plenty to contend with on the way, in fact the ship was hit by a meteor en-route killing a sheep and breaking a dog's leg.

'When they arrived the settlers made a home for themselves on an area of land called the Perth Peninsula not far from modern-day Perth.

'In honour of the journey one family built a house named after the ship, Tranby House, which remains one of the oldest or the oldest building in western Australia.'

Dr Robinson, who published his book telling the story of the Tranby and others in 2011, said he was amazed when a few months later he was contacted from Australia.

He said: 'When I saw the two oak trees at Tranby House I realised they came from the acorns taken over with the settlers, I jokingly said "could you send some acorns over?" and they did.

'We planted the seeds in the botanical gardens at the university but then we thought how fitting it would be if they returned to the spot where they came from.'
