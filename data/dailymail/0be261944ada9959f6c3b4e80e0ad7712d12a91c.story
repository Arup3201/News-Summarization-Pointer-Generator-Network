Police probing the photographer who took the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge are now questioning staff at the French chateau where the couple were staying.

In the latest development of the scandal, detectives want to know how the photographer knew exactly where to take the intrusive photos amid suspicions it was an 'inside job'.

The news comes after French paparazzo Pascal Rostain said it was an Englishman living in the south of France that staked out the Royal couple at the chateau while on their holiday.

And Danish celebrity magazine Se og Hoer has become the fifth publication to print photographs of Kate sunbathing topless as the images have now been seen by millions worldwide.

William and Kate have won a court order banning French Closer from selling or republishing the photographs, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine

A criminal investigation is under way to find and prosecute the 
photographer - who could face a year in jail and a £36,000 fine.

Police will now search the place where the pictures were taken more than half a mile from the retreat.

It is thought they will also look for clues or DNA traces left behind.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Officially the crime scene is the chateau and its environs.

'This will be visited by detectives who will then have to work out how the photographer came to be there - who alerted him to the presence of the royal couple and where he took the pictures from.

'This kind of investigation involves interviewing as many potential witnesses as possible.'

A spokesman for Clarence House said any investigation at the chateau was a matter for the French authorities.

Denial: If true, the claim would exonerate French photographer Valerie Suau, who claims she took bikini photos of Kate but not topless ones

Yesterday Mr Rostain, a close 
friend of former French First Lady Carla Bruni and one of France's most 
notorious long lens photographers, revealed the photographer who took topless pictures of Kate was British.

He also sensationally claimed 
that the photographer was spying on them on the orders of France's 
Closer magazine, which was first to publish 13 intimate images of Kate 
and William last week.

He told France Metro newspaper in 
Lyon: 'The irony of this whole thing is that the photographer who took 
these pictures is an Englishman living in the south of France.

'These photos were taken on the orders of Closer, who asked him to sit around for several days to take them.

'For his efforts he did not earn a lot. He could have sold them for 10,000 euros.

'But in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them.

'He didn't put them on the open market either, where he could have earned a lot more.'

Mr Rostain did not specifically say 
he knew the identity of Kate's photographer, but is known to be very 
well connected among the French paparazzi community.

He
defended the person who took them, adding: 'As a photographer, I take 
the pictures I want and let the publication decide whether to print 
them.

'What they choose to print is not the photographer's problem, but the editor's.'

Originally it was believed the intimate photographs may have been taken by a French photographer named Valerie Suau
- nicknamed The Sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname.

She has admitted taking pictures of Kate in her bikini, but said she does not know who took the topless photos.

The Royal couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by Closer, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine.

They
have also handed over all files containing the images to 
representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge, after they 
were ruled a 'brutal' invasion of privacy.

The
court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer, 
however, and it has the right to protect his or identity under France's 
laws on protection of journalistic sources.

But the ruling has not prevented the publication of the photos elsewhere.

Danish magazine Se Og Hor (See And 
Hear) became the fifth publication to print the photographs of the Duchess sunbathing topless yesteday.

The magazine's 16-page spread included 14 topless shots of Kate and three where she is changing her bikini bottoms

Yet the photos are still being touted on
the open market worldwide, with magazines in Italy, Denmark and Sweden 
all publishing them.

St James's Palace said 'proportionate responses were under review'.

The Swedish magazine which published the pictures on Wednesday, Se och Hoer and its 
Danish counterpart are owned by the Denmark-based Aller Media company.

Kim Henningsen, editor-in-chief of the Danish magazine, said he was 'incredibly proud' to have obtained the sole Danish rights to the 
photographs.

Closer published 13 grainy images of Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman.

Italian magazine Chi also published the pictures, while Michael O'Kane, editor of the Irish Daily Star, was suspended after publishing a selection that he called 'tasteful'

Italian magazine Chi also published the photos in a 26-page special edition.

Chi's editor Alfonso Signorini said on the matter: 'The fact that these are the future rulers of England makes the article more interesting and topical.

'This is a deserving topic because it shows in a completely natural way the daily life of a very famous, young and modern couple in love,' he said.

There are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of Kate and William at the time - many of them much more revealing.

Closer magazine's editor Laurence Pieau defended her decision to publish 13 of the photos, insisting the images were 'joyous'.

She said: 'These photos are not in the least shocking. They show a young woman sunbathing topless, like millions of women you see on beaches.

'They were not making any special effort to conceal themselves. Critcising our magazine is stupid.'

Ms Pieau also warned also that Closer had more photos, adding: 'Intimate pictures exist that we haven't published and will not publish. Probably other newspapers will choose to publish them.'
