A young father died of a massive electric shock as he fixed a cooker in a primary school just months before his third child is due to be born.

Jason Haslem, 24, was knocked out by a massive electric shock whilst working on the electrics system in the days before pupils were due to return for the first day of the new term.

He and his wife Jessica, who married in March last year, are expecting a third child due in March 2015.

The incident occurred on Thursday when he had been assigned to check over the cookers at Fir Bank Primary School in Royton, near Oldham, which teaches 202 pupils.

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
said it was likely to visit his employer Acme Refrigeration's 
headquarters in Blackburn today after it launched a joint investigation,
 alongside police, into his death.

Mr Haslem was a gas engineer and worked out of the firm’s Blackburn site in Philips Road. He had been employed by Acme for the majority of the past five years after starting work there as an apprentice.

And Mrs Haslem, 25, said becoming an engineer was all her husband had ever wanted to do.

The stay-at-home mother from Penwortham, near Preston, said: 'I don't know anyone who had a bad thing to say about Jason, there was not a single person he met who didn't like him.

'We met through mutual friends and knew each other for a long time before we got together. There was just nothing I could dislike about him.

'He was an amazing person and an absolutely amazing father - there was nothing he wouldn't have done to make life as perfect as he could for our children.

'I obviously struck lucky to have him as the father of my children - he was so supportive of me, and I was of him, even when we had some crazy hair-brained ideas.'

She added: 'He had such a drive and always wanted to learn more and better himself as a person, especially for the kids sake and to set a positive example for them.

'But I don't think he could have possibly bettered himself.

'George is far too young to understand what is going on, but I have told Toby that his daddy has gone to be a star, and he understands that.

'No amount of time will heal this, there is just no replacement for Jason. We will talk about him and remember him every day.

'I just feel lucky that in such a short space of time we shared so much, we didn't do things by halves and that was just the type of person he was.

'We all loved him so much and are going to miss him so much.'

In a 
statement posted on Facebook soon after the tragedy, she wrote: 'I want 
to thank everyone, from the bottom of my very empty feeling heart, for 
all of your kindness and thoughts.

She
 added: 'Numbness is wearing off, it's all starting to feel too real. 
Take me back a week please, I won't let Jason out of my sight.'

Mr Haslem's employers yesterday described Mr Haslem’s death as ‘a tragic accident’ and offered its condolences to his family.

Mr Haslem, from Penwortham, near Preston, is survived by two young sons - George, 22 months, and Toby, four.

Hazel 
MacKay, head teacher at Fir Bank Primary School, in Grasmere Road 
school, said the work was being undertaken to refurbish the school’s 
kitchen.

She said: 'Our thoughts are with this man’s family at this time and we offer our deepest condolences.

'The
 school was closed at the time this incident occurred due to the 
holidays. This matter is now being investigated by the Health and Safety
 Executive and we will co-operate fully with them.'

'It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of one of our employees, Jason Haslem.

'This is clearly a tragic incident for everyone at ACME Facilities Group Limited and for everyone who knew Jason but, above all, our thoughts and profound condolences are with Jason’s wife and family.

'Our priority now is to support them, and Jason’s colleagues, at what is an extremely difficult time.

'It is very important that the circumstances surrounding the incident are thoroughly investigated and we will of course continue to provide all necessary assistance to the authorities involved in that process.

'It would be wrong to say anything else whilst that investigation takes place.'

A spokesman
 for Greater Manchester police said: 'At 4.45pm on Thursday, August 28, 
police were called to Fir Bank Primary School following reports a man 
had been injured in an industrial accident.

'Officers
 arrived and discovered a 24-year-old man had been hurt and was 
unconscious. Paramedics tried to revive him but the man was sadly 
pronounced dead at the scene.

'At
 this stage, it would appear to be a tragic accident and a joint 
investigation is underway between Greater Manchester Police and the 
Health and Safety Executive to establish the exact circumstances leading
 up to this man’s death.'

A spokesman for the HSE said: 'The police are looking at it and if they decide there is no case for corporate manslaughter then they will hand it over to us.'

Details of Mr Haslem’s death will not be passed to the coroner for the District of Manchester North, Simon Nelson, until the police’s initial report is completed.
