The life of a football WAG has its perks, from showbiz parties to designer clothes.

So perhaps it’s not surprising that some women go to great lengths to win players’ attention – even outside of the glamorous Premier League.

Kerry Miller’s bizarre attempts to get noticed included barging into the team’s dressing room and sending them scantily clad photos of herself, a tribunal heard.

Accusations: Kerry Miller, pictured outside Leicester Tribunal Court, is accusing Burton Albion FC of constructive dismissal, sexual harassment and discrimination at an employment tribunal

The office worker at League Two  football club Burton Albion claims she was forced to quit her job by bosses.

But
 the club accuses the 45-year-old of bursting into the dressing room on 
at least 15 occasions while players were getting changed and showering.

She took on extra jobs to get in contact with players and sent them
 photographs of herself in her underwear, Leicester Employment Tribunal 
heard.

The mother-of-one, who had an affair with a player in his 20s 
and sent half-naked pictures to at least one other, worked in sales and 
support at Pirelli Stadium, in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, for two
 years until she left in February last year.

Club chairman Ben 
Robinson told the tribunal that mobile phone  pictures of Miss Miller in
 ‘various stages of undress’ were circulated among the team.

Kerry Miller is alleged to have burst in unannounced at least 15 times while players were undressing

He 
learned of the photos after two players – striker Calvin Zola, 31, who 
now plays for Aberdeen, and defender Zander Diamond, 28 – complained 
about her barging in on players in September 2012.

Mr Robinson said: 
‘The complaint was about Kerry’s conduct with regards to the number of 
times she was coming into the players’ dressing room while they were 
taking showers and partially dressed.

‘The players as a group would joke that any minute now Kerry would walk through the doors,’ he said.

The widow admitted sending  ‘private’ pictures to 23-year-old striker Billy Kee, who then showed them to his team-mates.

She told the panel: ‘The Billy Kee incident was an isolated mistake and I held my hands up and said I made a mistake.

‘I
 asked him to delete the photos and he said he would, but instead showed
 them to other players. He is not the brightest boy in the world and I 
wanted him to do what I asked [by deleting the photos], I didn’t want 
people knowing he had photos of me. I told him it could cost me my job.’

Miss Miller, whose husband died 18 months before she started work 
at the club, also admitted she had a ‘casual’ relationship with defender
 Ryan Austin, 29, who now plays for Brackley Town. She later described a
 new player as her ‘next conquest’ the tribunal heard. She allegedly set
 her sights on goalkeeper and model Stuart Tomlinson, who she thought 
was ‘fit’.

 She was pictured holding a modelling snap of him, ‘looking happy with herself’, the panel heard.

A photo of the pair was posted on Facebook during a night out while the player was off work recovering from an injury.

Sarah George, for Burton Albion, said: ‘This picture might have been seen by sponsors and supporters.

‘When
 you went into work the following week the club manager, Fleur Robinson,
 says she told you any relationship which affects the club would be 
frowned upon. This is the sort of thing which could bring the club into 
disrepute.’

 Miss Miller denied having designs on the goalie and stressed they were not in a relationship.

Miss
 Miller, who lives in a £400,000 house in Marchington, Staffordshire, 
with her daughter, denied claims she burst into the players’ dressing 
room unannounced.

She said she entered the changing room on only four occasions, and knocked and shouted each time.

The tribunal heard she went nightclubbing with another Burton Albion player and posted Facebook photos of them together.

The
 club, which denies unfair treatment, says Miss Miller took on jobs 
cooking and serving food in addition to her full-time role to get direct
 contact with players.

Mr Robinson allegedly asked her to stop 
serving meals, telling her to ‘concentrate on your job’. But Miss 
Miller, who started work at the club in September 2011, says she was 
forced to quit and is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual 
discrimination and harassment.

She said: ‘I was good at what I did. I
 loved my job, I was not going to let Ben [the chairman], who wasn’t 
there most of the time, stop me doing something I loved.’

Miss 
Miller, who describes herself on Facebook as a self-employed beauty 
worker, said she offered  to cook as a favour because the  chef was not 
coming in. Mr Robinson shouted at her for it, she said, adding: ‘I was 
upset and humiliated . . . which is why I later left.’

She claimed 
Mr Robinson called her ‘attractive’ and asked if she was ‘seeking a 
husband’ during her job interview. Mr Robinson said she got the job on 
the recommendation of her mother, Carol Richards, who also works at the 
club.

He added: ‘I categorically deny I made any reference to Kerry seeking a husband at Burton Albion.’

Mrs Richards said she believed Mr Robinson had ‘a soft spot’ for her daughter.

The tribunal, due to last five days, continues.
