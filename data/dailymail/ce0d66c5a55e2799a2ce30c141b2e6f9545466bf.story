A photo has emerged of the beautiful 
family-of-six that was destroyed when a neighbor shot five members - two fatally - in a pre-dawn home invasion.

Desmond John Moses, 55, was wearing a painter's mask and a 
bulletproof vest when he entered the Lamas family home in Inglewood, California, in the early hours of Saturday morning.

He set his bungalow ablaze before entering his neighbors' house in a murderous rage because he blamed them for an eviction notice he had 
received from their landlord, it is believed.

Filimon Lamas, 33, was shielding three of his children when he was killed.

Tragic: Gloria Jimenez and her husband Filimon Lamas are seen here with their four children. Mr Lamas and his four-year-old son were killed. Ms Jimenez, her seven-year-old daughter and six-year-old son were wounded

His wife Gloria
Jiminez, 28, was shot in both legs but managed to carry their seriously
wounded four-year-old boy out of the house, police said.

Paramedics found her collapsed on the street. The child, who was shot in the head, died in hospital.

Investigators believe Moses, who shot
himself in the head after the rampage, entered the family's home around 4am wearing a 
dark cap and a white painter's mask.

Suspect: Police believe Desmond John Moses, 55, attacked his neighbors after being served with an eviction notice

He is thought to have fired ten times, also wounding a seven-year-old girl in the chest, while a six-year-boy suffered a bullet wound to the 
pelvis. An eight-year-old boy escaped injury.

The mother and daughter remain in hospital in a stable condition; the six-year-old boy has been released.

Moses had lived in the bungalow 
behind the Lamas' home for 17 years.

Police recovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver registered to Moses at the scene.

His body, burned beyond recognition, 
was found inside the bungalow late on Saturday. Detectives are almost 
certain it is him; an autopsy to be carried out today will determine 
whether it is.

Moses had 'what appeared to be a gunshot wound to the head,' wore body armor and carried additional ammunition in his pockets.

Relatives said Mr Lamas and Ms 
Jiminez were high school sweethearts who recently got approval for a 
home loan, and were looking to move out of their property, where they 
had lived for eight years, and into a bigger house.

Authorities launched a manhunt and 
evacuated surrounding homes after the shooting rampage, but it wasn't 
until hours later that they found the charred body because it was hidden
under layers of debris.

The Los Angeles Times yesterday 
reported that Moses has held a security guard registration with the 
California Department of Consumer Affairs since 1984. However, police 
said they did not know whether he was working as a security guard.

Mr Lamas owned a small cafe near his home and had worked hard to turn it into a thriving business.

Victims: Ms Jimenez was shot in the pelvis and knee while she carried her wounded daughter out of the house

Aftermath: Emergency personnel respond to the scene of the deadly shooting in Inglewood

Investigation: Police recovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver registered to Moses at the scene

The house where the family lived was next door to Ms Jimenez's parents' home.Â 

Her brother, Jaime, told the Times that Mr Lamas was a devoted family man.

'All he breathed was his family. All he did, all he talked about was his family,' Mr Jimenez said of his brother-in-law.

Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said: 'The father was found draped over two of the children, shielding them.'

Police kept fire crews away from the 
burning home due to concerns that the gunman was still inside or hiding 
nearby in the bushes, KCAL reported.

About 8.30am, they were allowed to 
approach the residence and managed to extinguish the flames.

Motive? Moses lived in a bungalow behind the property, but was recently evicted

Five
homes in the immediate area have been evacuated and other residents 
were asked to stay away as officers scoured the neighborhood in search 
of the gunman.

Yesualdo Ramirez, 20, described the children targeted in the attack as 'happy kids' who enjoyed playing soccer.

Judy Castellanos, whose daughter is 
related to the 30-year-old victim, described the suspected killer to the
Times as a 'really weird' and 'dangerous' recluse who would not let 
anyone into his home.

She said he lived in one of the three 
rental units on the property, but had not paid rent for years and was 
asked to leave by the end of the month.
