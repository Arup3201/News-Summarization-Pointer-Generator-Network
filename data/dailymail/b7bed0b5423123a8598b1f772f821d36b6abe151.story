Hungry children from families too poor to eat are being taught cookery at school on Fridays so they have food to take home for the weekend.

Shocking figures have also revealed the number of Britons relying on emergency food handouts has soared to record levels - with charities warning the grim situation is going to get worse.

One in seven children regularly go without a hot meal, according to the Unite union, and in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a handful of schools are getting pupils to cook a high-carbohydrate, nutritious meal before heading home for the weekends.

Ralph Berry, who chairs the city's Child Poverty Board, said teachers had been noticing that children were underweight and urged other schools to follow suit.

He added: 'It is an impact of rising poverty really. It's a small thing that can help. People are sharing these ideas. We are trying to get schools to look at any steps they can to impact on poverty.'

The Trussell Trust, which runs a nationwide network of 270 foodbanks, said nearly 110,000 people turned to it for help between April and September - compared to 128,697 over the last financial year.

The organisation is expecting to feed more than 200,000 hungry mouths by the end of this financial year, with food prices likely to rise further and fuel bills increase by nearly 10%.

The worrying figures follow Prime Minister David Cameron's insistence that the economy is picking up.

Unite claims people are borrowing an average of Â£325 a month to pay for essentials, such as food and housing, while Oxfam estimates one in three children and 13 million people are living in poverty in the UK.

The Trussell Trust's executive chairman, Chris Mould, said the rising cost of food and fuel, combined with static incomes, high unemployment and changes to benefits is responsible for the soar in demand at foodbanks - , which provide three days food to people in crisis.

He said: 'The Trussell Trust has seen first-hand the devastating impact of rising food prices on people in poverty.

'It means that the budgets of people on the breadline are stretched even further so that even a small change in financial circumstances can push people into a crisis where they cannot afford food.'

The South West has the highest numbers turning to the Trussell Trust, with 21,000 people, including 7,000 children, 
being fed since April - just 5,000 less than the nationwide figure in 2008-09.

This is compared to 16,000 in the South East and 15,000 in London, where nearly 6,400 youngsters are among those going hungry.

In the West Midlands around 14,000 
people have been using foodbanks, compared to almost 12,000 in Wales and nearly 10,000 in the North West.

Less than 5% of the trust's clients are homeless and more than 90% of its donations come directly from the public.

Mr Mould added: 'Day in, day out, foodbanks already meet UK parents who are going without food to feed their children, or are forced to consider stealing to stop their children going to bed hungry.

'Further rises in food and fuel bills could see even more people in crisis turn to foodbanks.

'Many low-income working families are living on a knife edge. This rise in food prices could be enough to tip them into poverty, especially as winter approaches and heating costs increase.

'Christmas is looking bleak for thousands of UK families.'

Mr Mould added that donations, which include cereal and tinned meat and vegetables, have also risen to 875 tonnes.
