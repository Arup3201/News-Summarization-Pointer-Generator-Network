Gangster's son: Desmond Noonan, who spent some of a £1million lottery win on heroin, was jailed for five years

It could have been the perfect opportunity for gangster’s son Desmond Noonan to go straight.

Instead he used his share of his mother’s £1million lottery win to bankroll a big heroin deal.

The 27-year-old member of one of Britain’s most notorious crime families – which has twice been featured in TV documentaries – was caught with two other men with a haul of drugs worth almost £25,000 after being targeted in a police surveillance operation.

Noonan, who has served jail terms for carjacking and assault, was given a ‘significant portion’ of the money when his mother Mandy Burgess got lucky on a special Euromillions draw last September.

He immediately bought a £350,000 house and an Audi Q7.

But he also put some of the cash towards a large amount of heroin, which he planned to sell to drug users in Wigan, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Police arrested him with his two accomplices just moments after they had collected the drugs from a house in Oldham.

A black plastic bag recovered from under the front passenger seat of their car was found to contain a third of a kilogram of heroin, valued at £24,700. Noonan was jailed for five years after admitting possessing heroin with intent to supply.

Christopher Perry, 29, was jailed for 
four years and ten months after admitting the same charge and a separate
offence of cultivating a £30,000 cannabis farm.

Graham
Beaumont, also 29, who had previously served time for burglary, was 
jailed for two years after also admitting possessing heroin with intent 
to supply.

Jailing all 
three, Recorder Andrew Thomas QC said: ‘All of you are intelligent young
men, capable of so much more in life. But you have become involved in 
crime, all of you, from an early age.’ Noonan comes from a Manchester 
family whose criminal notoriety exceeds all others in the city and has 
led to a cult of ‘celebrity’ around them.

He
has previously blamed his violent behaviour on being unable to deal 
with the ‘wholly traumatic’ death of his father, Damien Noonan, a 
gangster who controlled the doors of nightclubs in Manchester in the 
1990s.

He was killed in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2003 aged 37.

In
2006 the family featured in a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary A Very 
British Gangster and last year they were again profiled in  At Home With
The Noonans – a  six-part documentary presented and produced by 
journalist Donal MacIntyre.

At
the same time Desmond’s twin brother, Damien, was jailed for six years 
and nine months for plotting to flood the streets with a banned dance 
drug and arranging the abduction and torture of a man.

His
uncle Desmond ‘Dessie’ Noonan, 46, after whom he is named, was stabbed 
to death in March 2005 during a drug deal with an enforcer for a 
Jamaican gang.

It later emerged Dessie was the uncle of Mark Duggan, whose fatal shooting by police in London sparked the 2011 riots.

Noonan’s 
mother Mandy Burgess is also the aunt of Kiaran ‘Psycho’ Stapleton who 
was handed a full life tariff for gunning down Indian university student
Anuj Bidve in Salford in December 2011.

After
the case Detective Chief Inspector Chris Downey said: ‘Now these men 
have been sentenced we will use the Proceeds of Crime Act   to strip 
them of any assets and cash they have accumulated from their criminal 
enterprise.’
