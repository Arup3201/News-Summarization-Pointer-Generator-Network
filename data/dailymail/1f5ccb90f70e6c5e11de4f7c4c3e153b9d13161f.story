The Nestle Prepared Foods Co. has ordered a recall of Lean Cuisine mushroom ravioli after consumer reports that glass shards were found in the product.

Officials say affected packages of Culinary Collection Mushroom Mezzaluna Ravioli have productions codes of 2311587812 and 2312587812. Both codes have a 'best before' date of December 2013.

Nestle said that it was forced to issue the recall after three people reported finding the glass in their meals.

Officials said that none of the affected customers were injured.

The Alaska Department of Conservation said the product was distributed in the state.Â 

It was sold back in November.

The company said in a statement: 'Nestle is dedicated to food quality, and the health and safety of its consumers. For these reasons, the company initiated this recall.

'We apologize to our retail customers and consumers and sincerely regret any inconvenience created by this voluntary product recall.'

It's not the first time the company has issued a product recall.

In 2011, Nestle recalled 10,000 pounds of Lean Cuisine frozen spaghetti and meatball dishes after customers in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin reported finding bits of plastic in their meals.

A similar action was taken in 2008 when Maryland-based Giant Food pulled the boxed foods off their store shelves when some customers found pieces of plastic in Lean Cuisine products.

Anyone who discovers the Lean Cuisine item is urged to call Nestle Consumer Services at (866) 586-9424 or leancuisine@casupport.com for further instructions.
