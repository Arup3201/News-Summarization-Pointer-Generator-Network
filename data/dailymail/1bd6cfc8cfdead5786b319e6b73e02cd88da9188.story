Enrique Iglesias' latest music video co-stars some of Galicia's most stunning landmarks but the fee local government paid for their inclusion has hit a raw nerve throughout the country.

The Galician regional government paid Universal Music Spain €302,500 (£222,000) to lure the Spanish-American pop icon to the north-west of Spain for the filming of his new track Noche y día (Night and Day), reports thelocal.es.

The opening moments appear to be money well spent, with helicopter shots of the Sil Canyon, Cabo Home lighthouse, Lugo's Roman walls and the stunning cathedral of Santiago de Compostela all taking centre stage. 

Galician officials paid Universal Music Spain €302,500 (£222,000) to get Enrique Iglesias video filmed there

The opening moments of the video feature landmarks including the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela...

.. And the Cabo Home Lighthouse, but once the electronic dance track kicks in the video is indoors

Even after the star's name and those of his guest artists, electro Latino act Juan Magan and Puerto Rico's Yandel, are flashed on screen 'Galicia, Espana' gets its moment.

But after the moody introduction the obligatory electronic dance track kicks in, the bevvy of beautiful young people multiplies and the sore point comes - the majority of the video to follow, barring the closing moments, is shot as a rave scene inside a beautiful but nondescript monastery. 

Spanish media say these scenes could have been anywhere and some calculate that less than a fifth of the video features the region - not enough bang for their euro in their view. 

An article by newspaper 20 minutos was headlined 'Enrique Iglesias y el presunto robo de 300.000€ Gallegos', which translates to 'Enrique Iglesias and the presumed theft of 300,000 Galician euros'. 

The Sil Canyon also appears in the opening shots but Spanish media say Galicia didn't get value for money

Iglesias' film clip for Noche y día (Night and Day), featuring Juan Magan and Yandel, was filmed in Galicia 

Another of the papers, La Voz de Galicia, counts that while 10 recognisable locations are seen in the video they take up a paltry minute of the overall clip's four minutes and 43 seconds.

The publication also worries that with the landmarks at the start and end of the clip – with the energetic middle element that also includes a women being oiled-up for a massage, happening mostly indoors – they could be cut out when it's shown on music video programmes.

Iglesias' Twitter plugs his new video and its filming location: 'Video of day and night out on February 27. I leave you a "preview" of what we record in #Galicia! @xunta

Iglesias appears happy with the result, plugging its February 27 release to his Twitter (right) and Instagram followers, including a hashtag nod to Galicia and linking to the government Twitter profile.

The government argues that the money paid to the music label for the popular culture exposure pales in comparison to a regular advertising campaign that could cost well in advance of one million euros.
