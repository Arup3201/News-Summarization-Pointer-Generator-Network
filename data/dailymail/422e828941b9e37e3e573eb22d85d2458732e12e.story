Accused: Pedro 'Pastor Pete' Custodio is alleged to have sexually assaulted three women in the Florida homeless shelter he owns and operates

A Florida pastor has been charged with sexually assaulting three females who used a shelter known as Our Father’s House of Refuge that he set up to help homeless women, police said.

Pedro L Custodio, 44, known as ‘Pastor Pete’, was arrested after three female clients of the Eustis shelter told police that he’d forced himself on them.

Custodio, who is married with children, has been charged with two counts of sexual battery and one count of attempted sexual battery. Police allege that he ‘exploited [the women] by gaining their trust’. 

The attacks are said to have taken place in the shelter, in Custodio's car and at his house. 

He denies all charges.

One woman told police that in July 2013 Custodio locked himself in the shelter’s food pantry with her and removed his underwear.

He is then alleged to have told her that he could ‘help her sexually’ because he’d heard that her boyfriend was jail and that her sex life had diminished as a result, the police report said, according to the Orlandosentinel.com.

He is alleged to have grabbed her by the hips and kissed her face and neck. She was eventually able to persuade him to stop by reminding him that he was a married father, police said.

Last month another woman told police that although she had been in a consensual sexual relationship with Custodio, he raped her on her birthday after they’d been for drinks.

The police report said: ‘(The victim) advised she was crying during the entire incident and (was) repeatedly begging for Pastor Pete to stop.’

The third woman told police in an interview that Custodio ‘pressured’ her into having sex with him.

The shelter, which Custodio set up in 2010, has the following mission, according to its website: ‘To assist the needy and homeless of our community, with spiritual guidance, food, clothing, information of other resources in our area, and feeding the soul and body.’

Custodio had been detained in Lake County Jail but has been released on a $30,000 bond.
