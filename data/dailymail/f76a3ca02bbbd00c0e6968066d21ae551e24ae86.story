It is possibly the first purpose built business to cater for people needing a hug.

A premises in Madison, Wisconsin, has been decked out with thick rugs, sofas, cushions and beds to welcome stressed or lonely people with open arms - which will be quickly wrapped around their clients.

Five full-time professional huggers are waiting to provide a special kind of intimate touch therapy to help reduce clients' stress levels and feel more relaxed - at a price of $60 an hour.

The concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $60

But their services may not be around for long as it's already been ridiculed and labelled as filthy by some local residents.

Staff at the newly-opened Snuggle House offer touch therapy to customers to help them relieve their stress, in a non-sexual way, with hugs and embraces and human touch.

But according to the business's Facebook page, a local bar has accused the staff of running a seedy 'bath house' and has refused to serve any of the professional snugglers.Â 

'Maybe it's not Madison's time for a progressive change in the status quo,' the Snuggle House staff say.

But the website is still live and inviting customers to book a session to benefit from their progressive form of human therapy.

Modelled on one woman's home-business in New York, which offers snuggles for $60 an hour in her own home, The Snuggle House in Madison is taking that concept to a larger business model.

Opening this week, Snuggle House manager Hannah told Channel3000com: 'Even just a hug for a couple of seconds can release the oxytocin in your body, in your brain, which has powerful effects to reduce stress.'

Little spoon: Like Jackie, the Snuggle House staff draw the line at intimate touching

She said having a good hug and sharing human contact with another person provides therapeutic value to clients, which many people lack in their normal lives.

'We go right into snuggling, spooning on a bed. It sounds crazy because it's two strangers, it's two people that don't know each other, and in our culture that doesn't happen.'

Among the five 'professional snugglers' there is one man, Lonnie. On the business's Facebook page, he is described as 'pure, gentle, strong in his character and he exudes a loving confidence that immediately sets you at ease.

'You can't help but want to give Lonnie a hug - pure bliss radiates from him.'

Emily is the youngest professional snuggler on board, but has a 'mature soul that genuinely cares for people and is making a difference by creating a space where you can be comfortable, accepted, understood, appreciated, held and cared for... isn't that what Touch Therapy should be?' it continues.

The intimate touch-therapy is based on Jackie Samuel's successful business, in Rochester, New York, which she launched last year to pay for her studies and to care for her young son.

The 30-year-old, who can earn up to $260 a day, opened her own cottage up to customers and has had such a positive response she's had to employ an additional snuggler.

Jackie cuddles up to 30 men a week as well as a number of women. The Snuggle House in Madison opened its doors to its first clients this week

The cuddling can take place anywhere around her cottage but most clients opt to use her large double bed.

They are banned from touching parts of her body covered by underwear, which she wears under pyjamas.

In interview last year, she said: 'I think clients come to me for all different kinds of reasons. Some of my older clients, their wives have passed away, and they just need someone to be with, like someone to experience touch with.

'Some of the younger clients are between relationships, some are in problematic relationships, and some people are just really curious and they come to just find out what it's going to be like.'

Like the Snuggle House in New York City, Jackie's business is about touch therapy to reduce stress, but she's still accused of more salacious activities.

She said she's received a barrage of emails and phone calls accusing her of being a prostitute.
