Drugs used for treating Alzheimer's disease may protect against heart attacks and death, claim researchers.

Scientists found medication such as Aricept was linked to a 38 per cent cut in the risk of heart attack, compared with people suffering dementia not taking it.

Those on the highest doses of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), which are used to treat mild to moderate disease, got the greatest reduction in risk.

The drugs are thought to have a beneficial effect on the vagus nerve, which controls how fast the heart beats, and may be anti-inflammatory.

Professor Peter Nordström, of Umeå University in Umeå, Sweden, who led the study, which included the drugs donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine and galantamine.

He said: 'If you translate these reductions in risk into absolute figures, it means that for every 100,000 people with Alzheimer's disease, there would be 180 fewer heart attacks - 295 as opposed to 475 - and 1125 fewer deaths from all causes - 2000 versus 3125 - every year among those taking ChEIs compared to those not using them.

'As far as we know, this is the first time that the use of ChEIs has been linked to a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in general or from any cause.'

In the study over 7,000 people with Alzheimer's were monitored from May 2007 to December 2010, says a report in the European Heart Journal.

Those who were on ChEIs had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from any cause, a 38 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack and a 26 per cent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes such as stroke compared to people not taking ChEIs.

Patients taking the highest recommended 
doses of ChEIs had the lowest risk of heart attack or death: 65 per cent
and 46 per cent lower compared with those who had never used ChEIs.

The researchers also checked whether the cut in risk applied to other drug treatments for dementia such as memantine, which works in a different way, but it made no difference to the risk of heart attack or death from any cause.

Prof Nordström said: 'We cannot say that ChEI use is causing the reduction in risk, only that it is associated with a reduction.

'However, the strengths of the associations make them very interesting from the clinical point of view, although no clinical recommendations should be made on the basis of the results from our study.

'It would be of great value if a meta-analysis of previous, randomised controlled trials could be performed, as this might produce answers on which clinical recommendations could be based.'

As the findings came from a nationwide group of patients, Prof Nordström said they were likely to apply to other countries.

Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The link between this particular Alzheimer's medication and heart health is interesting, but by no means definitive.

'We don't know if the medication itself caused the drop in heart attack risk or if another factor was involved. This is the first study to link an Alzheimer's medication to reduced risk of heart attacks so we need to see much more research before we can draw any conclusions.

'In the meantime, there's lots you can do to protect your heart without a prescription. Quitting smoking, eating a balanced diet and getting enough exercise are all great ways to keep your heart healthy. If you're over 40 you can ask your GP for a free health check.'
