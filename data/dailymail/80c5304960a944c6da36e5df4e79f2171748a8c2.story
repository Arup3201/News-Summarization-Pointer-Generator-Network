Fifty Shades of Grey has a lot to answer for.

Not only has the bestselling book sparked a revolution in bondage-inspired lingerie, been credited for reviving millions of sex lives and even encouraging people to experiment with light bondage, it’s now inspired a new range of sex toys - sex toys for men, that is.

Launched by the UK’s leading sex toy 
manufacturer, Lovehoney and developed with sex and relationship expert 
and MailOnline contributor Tracey Cox, Edge is the world’s first 
mainstream male sex toy range.

Cox has spent years developing the products and interviewed thousands of men who want to improve their sex lives.

She says: 'I have been writing, researching and talking about sex in books and on television and radio for 25 years and I get asked the same questions by men the world over.

'It’s always the same three: Am I big enough? Am I hard enough? How do I last longer?"'

One for the boys! Lovehoney's Edge range of sex toys for men includes the Stamina & Enhancing Pump, £29.99, left and the Stamina Sleeve, right, £12.99, used to 'intensify a solo sex session and train him to last longer in bed'

Tracey Cox added of the range: 'The time is right to launch the world’s 
first mainstream range of products aimed solely at men and the aim of 
Edge is to educate and inform men and to provide simple and effective 
solutions to their top three sexual needs.'

The innovative collection of products has been designed to improve male sexual performance and help men last longer in bed.

Products such as the Edge Penis Pump can improve the size and quality of a man’s erection, according to research.

Lovehoney report that sales of 
sex toys to men have soared since the book’s publication in 2012. Written
 by British E L James, it’s sold over 100 million copies worldwide and 
is currently being made into a Hollywood film starring Irish actor Jamie Dornan as it’s controversial antihero, Christian Grey.

Grey, a gorgeous billionaire with a Red Room for his BDSM antics, has inspired British men to be better and more adventurous in bed, according to Love Honey.

They credit the book’s phenomenal success
 and - the TV show Sex and  the City - for transforming the male sex toy
 market, which is now worth a staggering £10 million a year and is 
predicted to be the fastest growing sector of the sex toy industry in 
2014.

‘Sales of male sex toys have been steadily increasing over the 
last decade and it is the fastest growing sector in the market,' says 
Cox.

'We think lots of men will try out these new toys in the hope of improving their performance in bed. And lots of women will buy the products for their partners for the same reason!'

The range includes the Stamina & Enhancing Pump, which 'creates a vacuum to improve blood flow to the penis, ensuring healthy, firm erections.

Also, the Adjustable Stamina Ring, a silicone ring designed to make erections last longer and look more impressive and the Stamina Ring Set, doughnut-shaped rings in three sizes for contrasting tightness and intensity.

Finally, the Intense Stimulation Stamina Sleeve is used to intensify 'solo sex' and Extreme Sensation Personal Lubricant can be used safely on both men and women.
