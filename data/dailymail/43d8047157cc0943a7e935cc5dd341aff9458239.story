These amazing images show the annual nesting session for a giant colony of seabirds in Patagonia, Argentina.

Drone footage shows thousands of birds making a home for themselves across a 2,000 square metre (21,528 sq.ft.) beach on the Argentinian coastline. 

A team of researchers captured more than 5,300 pairs of nesting Imperial Cormorants, as part of a project to record the reproduction habits of the seabirds.

'We used friendly, funny, cheap and safe drones who made the previous laborious job made by pilots and photographers in the past,' Dr. Flavio Quintana, a leading marine conservation biologist said.

'The results were glorious, several high qualities images from different angles and altitudes allow us to determine, with accurate data, the real number of breeding pairs in different colonies which helps us to understand trends of the Patagonian population.'

'The drone footage shows a huge mixed colony of seabirds, several species nesting at the same site in the coast of Patagonia, Argentina.

'The Imperial Cormorant is a diving seabird that nest along the Patagonian coast of Argentina and Chile and is one of our research target species.
