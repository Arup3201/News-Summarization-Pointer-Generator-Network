The BBC faces a new sex scandal over claims two senior Doctor Who staff abused their positions to exploit fans.

A book alleges the show’s longest-serving producer, John Nathan-Turner, and his partner, production manager Gary Downie, preyed on young male fans in the 1980s.

Many of the men, the book says, were under 21 – at the time the homosexual age of consent.

Accusations: John Nathan-Turner on the set of Doctor Who. He was the show's longest running producer

Former Blue Peter editor Richard Marson makes the claims in his biography of Mr Nathan-Turner, who died in 2002.

In JN-T: the Life and Scandalous 
Times of John Nathan-Turner, Mr Marson says he was propositioned in 
1984, aged 17, after visiting the studio for a Doctor Who Magazine 
article.

He told online sci-fi magazine Starburst: ‘It happened after the first time I was invited to up to go and see a recording of the show, and he [Nathan-Turner] got a bit frisky, shall we say.

‘I was a bit taken aback; I was only 17 and . . . he said to me, “You’re so f****** provincial”. And of course I was f******* provincial, I came from Bishop's Stortford, I didn't know about anything.'

'I just thought I was in this kind of wonderland that was Television Centre, thinking it was an amazing place, and so I wasn't really prepared for anything really sophisticated.'

The next year, on the promise of 
Doctor Who photographs, Mr Marson visited the studio again. He says he 
was then assaulted by Mr Downie, who died in 2006.

The encounter took place in a BBC lift, he says, and ended with him fleeing and trying to hide beneath a desk.

In another incident, Mr Marson says a
 wealthy fan supplied Mr Nathan-Turner with male escorts in exchange for
 visits to the studio and souvenirs.

He adds both men were on the look-out
 for teenage fans who would have sex with them because of Doctor Who – 
dubbing the fans ‘doable barkers’.

He claims Mr Nathan-Turner, producer 
from 1980-89, once engaged in a sexual act in his BBC office while on 
the phone to Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter.

Claims: Producer John Nathan-Turner and 
production manager Gary Downie allegedly groomed young men - many of 
whom were under below 21, the then-homosexual age of consent - who 
visited the studios

The accusations come in the wake of 
the Jimmy Savile scandal, with fears the BBC DJ and Jim’ll Fix It host 
sexually abused up to 450 adults and children.

The BBC was accused of a cover-up after dropping a Newsnight investigation into Savile after his death in 2011.

The broadcaster has since established a review to hear victims’ evidence and to examine the culture of the institution. It has also launched a fresh probe into the latest allegations.

Mr Marson says some people felt the 
men’s behaviour was ‘inappropriate’, but were not willing to tell 
police.

He writes: ‘It would not be true to say I’ve found anyone 
willing to testify to coercion or abuse.'

He added to Starburst: ‘I think what you had was a promiscuous gay bloke in a position where his social life was very actively busy, and he had the opportunity to meet a lot of young people, and did like getting off with young guys.

'I don’t think he was predatory particularly, I don’t think he forced himself on the unwilling, I haven’t found any evidence of that.

But, Mr Marson went on: 'I found I was much more cautious about his partner Gary, than I was about John.

'I think John was just a go-with-the-flow, life-is-a-party, you know, “I’ll try it on and if somebody says yes, then that’s up to them.” I have less of a benevolent view of Gary.'

Working on the show for 20 years, Nathan-Turner was Doctor Who's longest-running producer.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We cannot 
comment on individual cases but clearly allegations of this nature are 
extremely serious.

'We have set up the Dame Janet Smith Review to help us
 understand how alleged incidents of this nature could have been 
committed and how we can avoid them happening again.’

█ Police dismissed reports of a 
suspected paedophile ring at BBC soap EastEnders. The Sun newspaper 
yesterday claimed a unit was set up over allegations adults groomed 
children on set in the 1980s and 90s.

Police said no such unit exists and no abuse was reported.
