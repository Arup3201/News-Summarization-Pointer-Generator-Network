It is the missile that never misses - and could be the future of combat.

This incredible video shows the latest test firings of the aptly named Brimstone missile.

Launched from a Reaper drone, it shows nine attempt to hit a car moving at 90mph - and nine direct hits.

The truck is destroyed - a feat the missile repeats nine times, with perfect accuracy on each test.

Weight: 110lb

Length: 71in

Diameter: 7in

Guidance: Millimeter Wave Radar and Semi-Active Laser

Warhead: Tandem Shaped Charge

The tests, conducted at the US Naval Air Weapons Station in China Lake, California, in December last year show the Brimstone-equipped MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) in action.

The missile scored nine direct hits against stationary and maneuvering targets traveling at speeds as fast as 70 MPH, while launching from up to 7 miles away at altitudes as high as 20,000 feet.

The tests were designed to show how Brimstone’s dual mode Semi-Active Laser and Active mmW radar seekers work in tandem to ensure direct hits, even against high speed and maneuvering targets.

MBDA, the firm which makes the missile, says that when launched from a drone, 'Brimstone can now provide reaper crews with a weapon that reduces collateral damage risk and demonstrates first pass, single shot lethality against high speed maneuvering targets on land and at sea and in complex environments.'

How it works: The Brimstone missile can be fitted with a range of warheads and systems

The trials were undertaken on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence by the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) Air Warfare Centre Unmanned Air Systems Test and Evaluation Squadron, Defence Equipment & Support Weapons Operating Centre, United States Air Force’s BIG SAFARI Organisation, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Incorporated and MBDA.

The RAF already uses the Brimstone on Tornado GR4 fast jets on operations in Afghanistan and Libya.

MBDA claims the missile is the most accurate on the market.

'A split second decision, a one-time opportunity: missing is not an option,' it says in a promotional site for the missile.

'In today’s complex world, America needs to know we’re hitting the right target – and only the right target – every time.

'When you have to hit a target, have to hit a budget and don’t have time to waste.'
