Cycling champion Sarah Storey has secured a hat trick of gold medals today after riding to victory in the women's C5 time-trial at Brands Hatch.

The 34-year-old from Manchester has already won two Paralympic titles in the velodrome before adding another gold from the 16-kilometre race against the clock today.

Storey finished the course, which included all the fabled sections of the motor-racing circuit, in 22 minutes 40 seconds.

She said: 'I'm absolutely delighted. It's just amazing to get around the circuit so quick. 'The first thing I'm going to do is see where I would have placed in the men's race.'

She would have been eighth at that split. Crystal Lane was ninth in 27:33.

This latest win takes her total tally of Paralympic golds to 10 - and she may even be in with a chance of boosting her medal haul later this week.

Storey will ride in the road race on Thursday seeking to level Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson's 11 Paralympic golds.

Speaking about the possibility of her matching Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson's medal haul after her velodrome wins, she said: 'It is fantastic, a
great feeling. I didn't expect to be able to catch her as quickly.

'I 
suppose it did look easy but mentally you have to prepare and make it 
happen. I have to respect all my competitors.'

She said of her latest success: ‘To compete in a home Games like this with all the crowds is a dream come true and I feel honoured to have been here.’

Twenty years ago, as a shy and 
nervous teenager, Sarah Bailey as she was then known, took part in her 
first Paralympics in Barcelona as a swimmer. She returned home two weeks
later with six medals, including two golds.

She won a total of five gold, eight silver and three bronze Paralympic medals at swimming.

She only turned to cycling in 2005 after an ear infection ended her swimming career.

After changing sports, Sarah met Barney Storey through cycling in 2004 and the couple married three years later.

She credits her husband with playing a major role in her transformation from swimmer to cyclist.

She said: ‘His expertise in cycling is just phenomenal.

‘Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo cycling sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grand prix in Europe.

‘Barney’s got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered raw swimmer, he just taught me everything I know.’

Following two golds in 2008, including in the time-trial, Storey now has a hat-trick on home soil in her sixth Games.

Meanwhile, Great Britain's Mark Colbourne had to settle for silver in the men's C1 time-trial.

Colbourne, who won individual pursuit gold in the velodrome, clocked 25mins 29secs on the 16km course, but Michael Teuber of Germany pipped him to victory, finishing first in 25:16.

It was the 42-year-old Welshman's third medal of his first Games after breaking his back in a paragliding accident three years ago.

'I gave it everything, I'm happy with my silver,' Colbourne said. 'I'm very proud of what I've done today.'
