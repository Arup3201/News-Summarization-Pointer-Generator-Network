Five members of a ‘family from hell’ attacked their neighbours like a 'feral pack' in their home in Plymouth.

Dean and Kirstine Mewton were set upon by three sisters and two brothers from the Richards family, all aged between 17 and 32.

The couple were at home when Joseph Richards, 20, threw a brick through their window and they went out to confront him, a court has heard.

Joseph Richards, 20, left, who threw a brick through his neighbour's window and Matthew Richards, 17, right, was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order with a curfew

Toni Richards, 21, left, was given a 26-week prison sentence and Bethany Richards, 20, right, was given a 12-month community order with 150 hours unpaid work

Lianne Richards, 32, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work

But Lianne Richards, 32, Toni Richards, 21, Bethany Richards, 20, and Matthew Richards, 17, then joined the attack.

The three sisters launched a 'sustained attack' on Mrs Mewton while the boys attacked her husband.

The couple and their teenage son Ashley were kicked, punched and grabbed by the hair, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

Dean was left with a double fracture to the jaw and Kirstine suffered severe bruising to her face in the attack in November 2010.

Judge Paul Darlow handed the siblings a mixture of suspended prison sentences, unpaid work and curfews after they admitted violent disorder.

He told them: 'There was a point at which Dean Mewton was on the ground, utterly defenceless, being punched and kicked.

'Mrs Mewton was knocked to the ground and there was a kick by a male to her chest.

'This was an attack in which the Richards behaved as a feral pack.'

Speaking after the hearing the couple branded them 'the family from hell'.

Kirstine said: 'They’re the family from hell. They think they’re above the law but they’re not.'

Joseph Richards will be sentenced on October 15, Lianne Richards was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work.

Bethany Richards was given a 12-month community order with 150 hours unpaid work and a three-month curfew between 8pm and 6am, seven days a week.
