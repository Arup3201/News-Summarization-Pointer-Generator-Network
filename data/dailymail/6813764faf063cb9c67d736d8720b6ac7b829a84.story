Garry Monk has revealed that Swansea are prepared to pull Wilfried Bony out of the Ivory Coast squad if they feel his involvement could expose him to Ebola.

The disease, which as killed almost 5,000 people worldwide, is especially prevalent in West Africa - where the Ivory Coast squad are due to play next month. 

Herve Renard's side will travel to Zambia later this month before heading to Sierra Leone for a crucial African Cup of Nations qualifier in November. They will then host Cameroon five days later.

The risk to the 25-year-old has not gone unnoticed by Swansea, who are keen to protect their £12million striker.

'We paid a lot of money for Wilfried, and you have to look after your assets,' Monk told The Mirror.

'Our medical team and doctors will converse with him, which is the most important thing. If there are any concerns between us and we feel this could really be a problem then we would have to pull him out.

'I am not here to stop any player representing his country. But if you have an asset like that and there were major concerns the liability lies with us, not their country or federation.'

Swansea's record signing scored 25 goals last season as he helped them finish 12th in the Premier League.
