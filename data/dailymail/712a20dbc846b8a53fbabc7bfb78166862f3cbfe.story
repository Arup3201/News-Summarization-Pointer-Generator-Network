A Facebook page has been created for users to report incidents of 'Islamophobia' and anti-Muslim sentiments as the Muslim community fears backlash after the counter-terror raids that took place on Thursday morning.

'Islamophobia Register Australia'  was created on Facebook just two days before Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history.

The operation saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs.

The operation saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs

Members of the Sydney Muslim community prayed prior to a rally in Lakemba, Sydney on Thursday after an overnight counter-terrorism raid took place across western Sydney

Following the raids, stories of police brutality against women and children emerged  which prompted the Islamic political party Hizb-ut-Tahrir to organise  protests defending their rights as Islamic Australians.

It appears the Facebook page is run by members of the Muslim community who have reacted to the counter-terror raids and fear for innocent Islamic people who face mistreatment in Australia. 

The page calls on Muslims to safely air reports of discrimination.  

'Please take time to send us reports of any Islamophobic incidents either by submitting a private message via this page or by sending us an email to islamophobiaregister@gmail.com.' 

It publicly shares reports  made by Facebook users. The page describes seven incidents of 'Islamophobia' which include women dressed in hijabs verbally abused in the streets of Sydney, a woman claiming a man tried to run her over as she crossed the road, and a Senior cleric and member of the Australian National Imams Council detained for over two and a half hours at Sydney airport.

The page also claims it has received hate mail, reinforcing the need for the forum's existence. 

The Facebook page provides information for victims of 'Islamophobia' seeking legal information 

To date, we have had reports of: 

- a mosque being defaced in Queensland

- a Senior cleric and member of the Australian National Imams Council detained for over 2.5 hours at Sydney airport without having his flight re-booked or reimbursed for costs incurred

- direct threats issued against the Grand Mufti of Australia, Lakemba Mosque and Auburn Mosque from anonymous members of the Australian Defence League

- women in hijab verbally abused in the streets of Sydney, at shopping centres and whilst driving

- One woman in particular claimed that a man almost ran her over as she tried to cross a school crossing outside her daughter's school in the Inner West of Sydney

- countless examples of social media vitriol targeting Muslims

The page has unfortunately also attracted a lot of hate mail, bigotry and vitriol which perhaps ironically proves why such a register is required in the first place. 

Victims of 'Islamophobia' are provided with support information that is posted to the page. It offers contact details for counselling and free legal consultations. 

'Were you directly or indirectly affected by the current issues affecting our community, or even feeling overwhelmed by it all?

'Mission of Hope's crisis intervention centre at Hayat House is hosting a CRISIS CENTRE DROP-IN FOR INDIVIDUALS / FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT POLICE RAIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY,' a post on the page reads.

The page has only existed for six days but has already attracted over 1,500 followers.  

Daily Mail Australia contacted the 'Islamophobia Register Australia' for comment.

Facebook user Jason Dickeson responded to Daily Mail Australia's comment on the page expressing backlash against the purpose of the page.

He believes the page is biased and deletes comments made by non-Muslim Australians who have been threatened by Muslims. 

'You should be asking them why they have taken down the posts of people that have had Muslims threatening them in the streets. 

'Can we come to your legal service and get advice from you when they have threatened other people for no reason other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time?

'Can the lady from yesterday get advice about the Muslim lady making a throat slitting gesture towards her for no reason?', Mr Dickeson posted on Sunday. 

But four hours before Mr Dickeson's comment,  Facebook page posted a comment insisting 'all unrelated posts that include profanities and/or are offensive will be deleted from the page'.

To submit a report to the Facebook page a person must provide their full name, street address, email address and phone number.
