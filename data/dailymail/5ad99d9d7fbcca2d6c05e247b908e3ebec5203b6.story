Gareth Southgate will protect his young players from burnout even if it means gambling with England’s ambitions at the Toulon Tournament on Friday afternoon.

England’s Under 20s need a point from their final Group B game against Colombia to qualify for Sunday’s third-fourth place play-off, but Southgate will make at least seven changes to the side that drew 1-1 with South Korea on Wednesday.

The past 11 days for this squad have been taxing, given they also faced a Euro 2015 qualifier against Wales, and though no Premier League or Championship clubs have spoken to the FA, Southgate is conscious of the workload.

Cautious: Gareth Southgate will protect his young players from burnout at the Toulon tournament

James Ward-Prowse of Southampton, Chelsea midfielder Nat Chalobah and Norwich winger Nathan Redmond will be given a break and head coach Southgate is happy to take responsibility if eliminated.

‘We don’t want to pick up any unnecessary injuries, so we’ve got to respect the clubs and the welfare of our players,’ he said. ‘The only difficulty of the tournament is that there’s just one day between games. 

It is impossible for the lads who have played three games to play again. If I was a club manager and saw my player playing three games in five days, I could understandably say we were negligent if they suffered an injury. 

‘We will have to make seven changes. If we get through, we’d do the same again. But we couldn’t ask James and Nat to play (against Colombia). To do that would be asking for trouble. We’ve got to trust the rest of the group to get the result we need.’ 

A game against either France or Portugal in Avignon on Sunday would be beneficial with Euro 2015 in mind, and Southgate added: ‘The chance to play better sides is even more important. These boys have been taken out of their comfort zones and benefited for it.’
