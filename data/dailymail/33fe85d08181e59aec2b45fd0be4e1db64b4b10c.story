A woman who found a decades-old wedding photograph washed up outside her home in the wake of Hurricane Sandy is returning it to the original owners after a two-year hunt.

Leah Welsh, who lives on the shore of Long Island, found the black-and-white photograph on her lawn in 2012 after the storm had devastated the East Coast.

It shows a smiling woman in white pinning a boutonniere on an older man wearing a bowtie and tuxedo.

The image is thought to be a photograph from the woman's wedding, and show her helping her father prepare to walk her down the aisle.

Welsh, from Massapequa, New York, described the moment she found the picture to NBC News.

She said: 'I called my husband over and I said, "Can you believe that I just found a picture? And look at the condition of it, it's perfect,"'.

'It actually brought tears to my eyes because... I couldn't believe that I found it.'

Despite searching for the owners immediately after she rescued the picture, Welsh wasn't able to find anybody.

But after other attempts more recently, she was contacted by relatives of the people pictured, who say they will claim the photograph soon.
