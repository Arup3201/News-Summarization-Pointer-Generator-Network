The 18-year-old was jailed for 16 years for the attack on a 91-year-old woman 

A teenager has been jailed for raping a 91-year-old woman after forcing his way into her home.

Lee-Joseph Dixon inflicted the 'life altering' attack as he was making his way home from an all night party.  

The 18-year-old from Ely, Cariff, ignored the frail pensioner's plea to leave her alone and forced himself upon her in the early hours of the morning. 

Newport Crown Court heard how Dixon had 'not one ounce of pity' for the vulnerable woman after he knocked on her door at 4am.  

The teenager will spend eight years behind bars and serve the remainder of a 16 year sentence on licence. 

The court heard how Dixon began randomly knocking on doors as he walked  home from a party on May 24.

When the woman answered barefoot and in her dressing gown, he forced his way in and raped her. 

She was found still shaking and clutching the phone when police arrived at the scene. 

The pensioner spent two weeks in hospital before being transferred to a care home. 

She was unable to return to the house she had lived in since she was a child following the attack. 

Prosecuting Kelly Huggins said the rape had 'devastated' the woman. 

'The Crown Prosecution Service worked alongside South Wales Police from an early stage in their investigation. 

'Together, we were able to swiftly build a strong prosecution case against Dixon, leading to his guilty plea.

'While it is right that Dixon has today had to face up to his actions in a criminal court, we should not forget that his reprehensible behaviour has had a devastating effect on his victim.

Newport Crown Court (pictured) heard how the teenager randomly knocked on doors at 4am before the woman answered 

'She has understandably found it hard to return to the relatively independent life she had enjoyed prior to this horrific incident and our thoughts are with her.'

Today the victim's son said he was surprised the attack did not kill her. 

'We are struggling to come to terms with how a young man can do such an horrific violating act to an old woman in her own home where she is meant to feel safest.'

Detective Inspector Stuart Wells of South Wales Police's specialist crime investigations squad said the incident was one of the most distressing cases he had ever worked on.

'This was a very serious incident which understandably caused a lot of public concern....an elderly lady suffered a dreadful attack in her own home.

'This has been a life altering experience but one where the victim and her family have shown remarkable emotional strength in dealing with what happened to her.' 

Dixon pleaded guilty to rape, but said he had no memory of the attack.

He will spend eight years behind bars and serve the remainder of his sentence on licence. 

The 18-year-old will be on the dangerous sex offender's register for the rest of his life.
