Ten years ago the eyes of the world were on him as he kicked England to glory in the Rugby World Cup final.

But when Jonny Wilkinson got married this week, the ceremony was a distinctly more private affair.

England’s former fly-half invited only two witnesses to his secret nuptials with long-term girlfriend Shelley Jenkins, 33, in the South of France.

Happy couple: Jonny Wilkinson, 34, and his wife Shelley Jenkins, 33, were married in a private ceremony

The couple met eight years ago while she was working as a cocktail waitress in the Majorcan resort of Magaluf. 

They were married on Monday at the town hall of the Riviera resort of Bandol near Toulon, where Wilkinson now plays his rugby.

Neither of the two witnesses were thought to have been family members. Locals said it was an ‘intimate affair’.

Christian Palix, the mayor of Bandol, who officiated, said: ‘I told him that the town was very honoured to marry him and I myself was very honoured to perform this marriage. I wish them great happiness in our town.’

He said he offered them an olive, which symbolises happiness.

Mr Palix said that both Wilkinson and his new wife are well known in and around Toulon and are ‘both viewed with great respect’.

The couple met just after Wilkinson, 34, split from Sky Sports presenter Diana Stewart because he felt that ‘having a girlfriend distracted him from his rugby’.

It was just two years after Wilkinson became a national hero when he scored that last-minute drop goal against Australia in 2003 that made England world champions for the first time. 

Miss Jenkins caught Wilkinson’s eye while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar called Daiquiri Palace.

The university graduate from Cleeve near Bristol, had spent many summers in Majorca’s party resort of Magaluf with her twin sister, Tracey.

Wilkinson and Miss Jenkins were photographed on a beach together and she visited his family holiday home in Palma. The couple have been together ever since.

She moved to France with him when he joined Toulon in May 2009 after 12 years with Newcastle. The couple have both done their best to learn French and enjoy the Gallic pace of life.

When he first crossed the Channel, Wilkinson said he wanted to concentrate on getting his work-life balance right, explaining: ‘I was attracted by the beauty of so many new experiences – new team, new language, new region, living like that.’

Their turn: The couple were pictured together at the marriage ceremony of Zara Phillips Mike Tindall, at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, above

Early days: Shelley stepped out with the rugby star when he was nominated for a Sports Personality of the Year award in 2007, above

He said he made the move because he wanted to ‘embrace a new way of doing things’.

Miss
Jenkins’s father Malcolm, who died in 2008, was the director of Sureway
Scaffolding in Bristol, while her mother Linda was the company’s 
secretary.

Wilkinson comes 
from a sporting family. His father, Phil, was also a rugby player and 
cricketer, his mother, Philippa, played squash at county level and his 
brother, Mark, also played rugby for Newcastle.

In action: Wilkinson decided to get married close to Toulon, where he now plays his rugby. The fly-half was in action last week when his team played in the Heineken Cup against Cardiff Blues, above
