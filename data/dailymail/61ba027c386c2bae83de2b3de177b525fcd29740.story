Patricia Wilson, pictured, had a brief affair with gardener Jean-Louis Cayrou before telling friends she had broken off the relationship

A French gardener accused of murdering a British woman who disappeared from her home in the South of France is to be released from prison.

Jean-Louis Cayrou, who had a brief love affair with Patricia Wilson before she broke off the relationship, made the successful appeal on Friday.

A judge in Montpellier ordered Cayrou, 51, who denies any involvement in the disappearance of Miss Wilson, 58, to be fitted with an electronic bracelet to monitor his movements.

He remains under investigation for the murder of Miss Wilson and was due to be released at the weekend.

French sources reported that prosecutors have 48 hours to appeal against the judgement.

During
the past year whilst Cayrou has remained behind bars in Montpellier and
Nimes they have successfully appealed against several release demands 
by his lawyer.

Their case against Cayrou was based on 
threats he made against the British woman prior to her disappearance, 
blood found in the boot of his car which contained her DNA and the fact 
that a spate of calls he made to her on his mobile phone suddenly ceased
just after she disappeared. 

French forensic officers searching the home of Patricia Wilson in the hamlet of Les Landes Basses between Toulouse and Montpellier, South West France, last August. Large quantities of blood were found in the house

August last year and found bloodstains in her living room and on steps 
leading into her picturesque garden

Patricia
Wilson had just returned to her home near the village of Vabre-Tizac 
in the Aveyron department after visiting friends in the UK.

He allegedly threatened her when she called off the affair and told her that she ‘could not live without him’.

Miss Wilson had moved to the village of Vabre-Tizac six years ago. 

The
former advertising executive, from Welwyn Garden City, had reportedly 
sold her property portfolio in Hertfordshire to buy the tumbledown 
cottage to retire with her long-term partner Donald Marcus.

But
neighbours in the village said the keen artist and photographer had 
separated from him after he returned to the UK, and she had started a 
brief relationship with her gardener.

He
was placed under investigation after blood samples taken from her house
and the boot of his car matched Mrs Wilson’s DNA profile.

A
friend in the UK said at the time of her disappearance that Miss Wilson
and Mr Marcus had sold their houses in Hertfordshire to fund the move 
to France in order to renovate their dream cottage.

Gendarmes
scoured fields and woods around the village and divers searched lakes 
and ponds but never found any trace of the British woman.

She
had told them she had broken off a love affair with Cayrou, who lived 
alone in a small caravan and did gardening work for several British 
expats.
