A koi carp named Chadwick has finally returned to his pond after escaping during a flood two months ago and turning up in a river seven miles away.

Staff at Romsey World of Water in Hampshire noticed the the two-foot long chagoi koi was missing along with and a sturgeon named Steve after water from the flooded River Test overwhelmed the aquatic centre in February.

While Steve was discovered in a puddle in a nearby petrol station a few weeks later, staff thought they were unlikely ever to see Cahdwick again - until a dog walker reported seeing the distinctive fish swimming in the River Test near Totton - a staggering seven miles from where he escaped.

Staff at the centre say Chadwick and Steve have become 'inseparable' after their travels.

Following the escape, a wide search resulted in Steve being found at an Esso garage just one mile from Romsey World of Water.

And almost two months after fleeing the aquatic centre, Chadwick was finally located by a walker who recognised the distinctive fish swimming in the River Test.

Chadwick was thrown bread by people who were walking past the Salmon Leap pub in nearby Totton while his owner was called to the scene.

Chadwick had swum a staggering seven miles - crossing roads and industrial estates to get to his final location.

Distance: Chadwick was eventually founding swimming in the River Test near Totton - a staggering seven miles from the aquatic centre

Dry again: Chadwick has now returned to Romsey World of Water after a dog walker spotted him in the River Test and phoned the manager. The centre has now returned to normal following the floods (pictured)

He even lost one pound in weight during his epic journey - with the 10-year-old fish now weighing just nine pounds.

The pair sparked a search when the aquatic centre's lake was overwhelmed by the winter floods in February, allowing both fish to swim away.

Staff at the aquatic centre thought Chadwick - who is nicknamed Chad - was unlikely ever to be found, despite repeatedly hearing about sightings.

Centre manager Mark Bradbury, 53, said: 'It's a fantastic story, no one could believe where Chad had ended up. We didn't think we would get him back, but when he was eventually spotted, we all breathed a huge sigh of relief.'

'Chad is such a fantastic fish, he's so friendly and everyone who visits the centre knows him and has missed him over the last two months. He's been at the centre for seven years and everyone recognises him, he added.

Hunt: A search was launched after the two fish escaped. This resulted in Steve the sturgeon being found in a puddle at an Esso garage just one mile from Romsey World of Water

'People think of fish as not being very 
sociable, but chagoi koi carp are very friendly and very tame... Chad has
 such a strong personality and will always approach people when they 
come close to the water - he's the most popular fish here,' Mr Bradbury went on 
to say.

Mr Bradbury says Chadwick was finally located after a woman contacted him to say she had seen the fish swimming in the River Test and recognised him from the 'missing' posters that the aquatic centre had put up.

'When he left he weighed ten pounds, but he has lost one pound because of all of the swimming,' Mr Bradbury said.

'He's like an athlete now - when he left he was more of a couch potato, but now he's such a strong swimmer,' he added.
