One of the victims of Friday's fiery hot air balloon crash was burned alive while the two others died of blunt force trauma, according to the medical examiner's office.

The causes of death for the victims of the crash in Virginia on Friday were released ahead of a memorial service at the University of Richmond, where two victims worked, on Wednesday.

The autopsy revealed that the university's director of basketball operations Natalie Lewis, 24, died of acute thermal injury - a term used to described severe burns, according to the News Journal.

Associate head coach Ginny Doyle, 44, died of blunt force trauma to her neck and torso, while the pilot, Daniel Kirk, died of blunt force trauma to his head, torso and extremities, it found.

The report added that the deaths were accidental.

Funeral services for Kirk will be held at 1pm on Saturday at the Hartly United Methodist Church in Hartly, followed by a reception at the Hartly Volunteer Fire Company.

At 10am on Wednesday, the University of Richmond held a public memorial for Doyle and Lewis at the Cannon Memorial Chapel, days after students paid tribute to them at graduation ceremonies.

The balloon was among 13 that lifted off Friday on a preview night for the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival. It left Meadow Event Park and headed northeast to a landing zone two miles from the park.

Terrifying: The balloon hit a power line as it tried to land on Friday and burst into flames, killing its occupants

Horror: At some point, the basket detached from the balloon and the bodies were found in a wooded area  

As others landed safely, it struck a power line, burst into flames and fell into a heavily wooded area about 25 miles north of Richmond, said Corrine Geller, with Virginia State Police.

On the ground, 'it was complete silence,' spectator Nancy Johnson said. 'There were people praying. It was horrible.'

Corinne Geller said another pilot interviewed by investigators described how the pilot tried to open vents to release extra-hot air in an attempt to keep the balloon from rising faster.

At one point, the balloon and its basket separated and the balloon took off, state police said.

'Based on witness accounts, he did everything he could to try to save the passengers' lives,' Geller said.

She added that it may never be known if the victims jumped or fell out as the basket and balloon came apart.

Excitement: Lewis and Doyle are pictured on the morning of their flight on a test run with a different pilot

Loss: The women were remembered at a memorial service at the university on Wednesday morning

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

Doyle, 44, was hired by Bob Foley at Richmond in 1999 and stayed on through coaching changes.

Lewis,
 24, was a four-year letter-winner in swimming who just completed her 
second season with the basketball program. Her job required organization
 skills as she made travel, hotel and bus arrangements for the team, 
planned for meals and handled day-to-day basketball business.

In the grind of a season, broadcaster Matt Smith said, she was a shining light.

'Sometimes when you work in sports, coaches can be so high strung and so focused on the next game or what's going on that you feel almost uncomfortable when you go into the office, but her being the first one that you would see, she always had a smile on her face,' Smith said.

The University of Richmond on Monday released statements from the women's families expressing thanks for the support they've received.

Loved: Student Laura Jordan wore a red ribbon with her hat decorated with initials of Natalie Lewis and Ginny Doyle before the University of Richmond's Commencement Ceremony on May 11

'Natalie loved people. She was our constant source of happiness and joy,' Lewis' family said in the statement. 'She used genuine words and selfless actions to gently help others be more successful and more fulfilled.'

Doyle's family recalled Ginny as a 'daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, niece, athlete, teammate, coach, teacher, colleague, friend and storyteller' who 'touched the lives of many and lived life to the fullest.'

Kirk, of Delaware, was known by fellow pilots as 'Capt. Kirk,' the hammy commander of the USS Enterprise on the TV series Star Trek.

Steve Hoffmann, who said he taught Kirk to fly and built the balloon he was piloting, called him 'one of the nicest guys in the world' and a consummate professional.

'He was not a hot dog, not a risk taker,' Hoffmann said. "'t's so unbelievable that everyone's in shock.'
