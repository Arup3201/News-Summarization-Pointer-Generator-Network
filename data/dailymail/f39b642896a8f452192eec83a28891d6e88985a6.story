The heartbroken father of a talented schoolgirl found dead in woods said yesterday the family had tried desperately to help her ‘overcome her dark thoughts’.

The body of Helena Farrell, 15, was discovered half a mile from her home in the picturesque town of Kendal on the edge of the Lake District.

The gifted cellist and singer had been out with friends just hours earlier on Friday and seemed ‘very happy’ when she said goodbye to them to walk home.

But at about 10pm her body was found in dense woodland close to the grounds of the town’s Castle Green Hotel.

Cumbria Police said they were not 
treating the death as suspicious. A video montage of the musician, 
created by her friends, had received more than 18,500 views on YouTube 
last night.

Her father Enda Farrell, 55, wrote a 
moving tribute beneath the video from himself, his wife Maria and their 
14-year-old son Declan, a talented violinist.

The former Kendal councillor said: ‘This beautiful girl is my daughter Helena, and she was the light of my life.

‘We tried desperately hard to help her
overcome her dark thoughts that began to cloud over her shining 
personality. My family is totally ripped apart.

‘Thanks to those who made this collage
video and to all those who have made such beautiful comments about her 
and for sending kind thoughts to us.’ They also paid tribute to their 
‘beautiful, loved and cherished daughter’ in a statement.

Farrell playing the guitar, surfing, squeezing into a toy car, laughing 
with friends and enjoying mountain views on a school trip.

The teenager, who went to the 
comprehensive Kirkbie Kendal School, also studied at the Royal Northern 
College of Music, Manchester, and dreamed of becoming a professional 
musician.

Police are continuing their investigation but say the death is not being treated as suspicious

Voice: Helena was a promising cellist and was awarded a merit in a singing exam earlier this year

Last year she achieved a distinction in a grade seven cello 
exam and a merit in a grade six singing exam on the same day.

She also played the lead role of Scaramouche in her school’s musical We Will Rock You.

Yesterday, her friends spoke of their 
‘disbelief’ at her death. Edan Carr, 16, said: ‘Helena came out with us 
for a few hours on Friday and she was fine. She had a very happy day. We
all went to KFC and talked and then chilled out in town for a bit.

‘At the end of the afternoon, she gave us all hugs and said she was going to walk home.

‘When I found out someone had found 
her, I couldn’t believe it. I was lost for words. I can’t understand it.
She was really smiley and happy all the time.

She was a great lass. She
was so amazing at singing, she sang opera-style music. She always 
wanted to record a song, that was her dream.
