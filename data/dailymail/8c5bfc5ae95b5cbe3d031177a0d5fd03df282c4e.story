In a market saturated with fizzy drinks, fancy re-hydration or sports drinks and a variety of tasty juices, the most healthy of all, water, hardly gets a look in.

This probably explains why new research has revealed that less than one third (29%) of Australians actually drink the correct amount of water each day, leaving the rest at risk of dehydration.

And with summer right on our doorstep, keeping hydrated in the hot weather is essential. 

Less than a third of Aussies drink the recommended amount of water per day, leaving the rest at risk of dehydration

The study by Thermos Australia also found that not drinking enough water often had a noticeable affect on performance

The study by Thermos Australia also found that not drinking enough water often had a noticeable affect on performance with 80 per cent who failed to drink the recommended amount feeling an impact on their body.

And for those that did feel an impact, almost three quarters (69%) noticed feelings of dehydration when they failed to guzzle enough water, around 57 per cent got headaches and 44 per cent experienced exhaustion.

Most wouldn't think it but according to a study from the University of Barcelona, being dehydrated by just two per cent impairs performance of the simplest of tasks, like throwing a ball.

It only takes one to two per cent loss of body water to cause mild dehydration, impacting tasks that require attention and psychomotor, which is the relationship between cognitive functions and physical movements.

And surprisingly drinking less water can also have an affect on your mood and make you a lot less productive.

With soft drinks (pictured left), juices (pictured right) and sports drinks taking over the market, water has been forgotten with less than a third of Aussies actually drinking enough each day

Findings show over a third (37%) of those who suffer health issues experience low mental awareness, while a further 30 per cent said they slip into a poor mood without the right consumption of H2O each day.

'Dehydration, no matter what level, is dangerous and this research highlights there are serious side effects that ultimately could be prevented by consuming more water,' says Paul Fitzgerald, Marketing Manager at Thermos Australia.

1.  Keep it cool

If you prefer your drinking water to be cold, store it in a Genuine Thermos Brand Hydration Bottle as it keeps contents cold for up to 18 hours, no matter what environment you’re in.

2.  Be mindful of intake

Make a conscious effort to drink more water throughout the day even if you don’t feel thirsty and keep a water bottle by your side to serve as a reminder to consume more.

3.  Plan ahead

If you know you’re going to have limited access to water during your day (like tradesmen or those on the road) get organised in the morning and take a large bottle of water from home.

4.  Add some flavour

If you don’t like the taste of water try adding a squeeze of lemon or lime (or both) into your bottle.

'Even if you're not exercising or exposed to harsh environments, consciously drinking more water is something we all need to turn our minds to.'

'Poor health is a serious issue and there is a need for greater awareness among the general public about the importance of proper hydration, especially as we head into summer,' he said.

'The number one way to increase our water intake, according to 39% of the nation, is simply making an effort to think about drinking more water.'

A tip to drink more water is to record how many glasses you've consumed throughout the day according to experts

Just under a fifth (19%) of Aussies said they would consume more water if they could keep it colder for longer

'This may sound obvious but how do we put this into practice? Keeping a water bottle by your side can actually remind you to drink more water.'

'Another tip is to record how many glasses you've consumed throughout the day,' said Mr Fitzgerald.

The Thermos study also found nearly a quarter (21%) of Australians would drink more water if it tasted better and a further 21% would if they felt thirstier throughout the day. 

Just under a fifth (19%) of respondents said they would consume more water if they could keep it colder for longer, while 16 per cent said they would drink more water if they had better access to it throughout the day.

'We are very fortunate to live in a country with superior water availability, however if being out and about during the day is limiting your water intake, plan ahead and take water with you from home,' added Mr Fitzgerald.
