Nani is the typical Portuguese boy who played in the streets when he was young – when the digital era was still to come.

His streets, however, were one of the poorest in Lisbon, exactly in Bairro Santa Filomena, one of the more problematic neighborhoods in the Portuguese capital.

Nanaca, as he’s called by his family, played on those streets barefoot, because his family had no money to buy him soccer shoes. But the foot injuries didn't keep him at home. The soccer ball was everything.

One day a scout from Real Massamá, a local club, caught eyes on him and convinced Nani and his family to play for them.There he had lunch and dinner everyday, because they knew about his family difficulties.

The winger played for the club between 1997 to 2003, when he signed for Sporting, after other proposals from, for example, Benfica and FC Porto. Nani even today is grateful to his first club and he tries to help every time he can.

He’s one of the most humble Portuguese football players and that - along with his great skills -  is why he always wins the trust of national coaches. Nani is probably the most technical Portugal player in their World Cup squad and is also in the top three of passing and assists abilities.

In the shadow: Nani is hoping this World Cup will be where he outshines team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo

Even if he didn’t have a great season with Manchester United, he was never in doubt for the World Cup and was probably the second or the third player that coach Paulo Bento picked - only behind Cristiano Ronaldo and João Moutinho, other key players.

He’s made the cut because in these big tournaments he usually does a great job. For example at Euro 2012 he was, for us Portuguese journalists, the best Portuguese player in that tournament alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. We expect a great World Cup from Nani because he arrives in Brazil physically in shape and with few games in his legs, and that can be good for the Portuguese team. More importantly, he became a father last December, so will be full of confidence for this tournament. At the age of 27 this is the right time for him to shine at a World Cup. This will be his first World Cup as he didn't make the 2010 edition in South Africa due to a late injury, and he will want to prove that there is more to Portugal's team than Cristiano Ronaldo.
