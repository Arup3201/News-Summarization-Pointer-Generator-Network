Despite her half-brother, Conor, splitting from Taylor Swift last month, Kick Kennedy has revealed that she is still a big fan of the country music star.

The 24-year-old political scion told Town&Country: 'Taylor’s sweet, and so catchy I can’t believe it. I can’t get her songs out of my head.'

She was snapped at her family's compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, wearing a selection of laid back styles for the December issue of the magazine.

Kick, who is an aspiring actress is
 the only daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and
 the niece of President John F. Kennedy, and his first wife Emily 
Black.

She explained that being a member of America's most famous political dynasty can often bring unwanted attention.

'People
 ask me, "What’s it like being a Kennedy?"  Maybe it’s the temperature 
of the water, but I’m just like, "I have no idea." 

'When I see my face 
or name in the tabloids, I get a knot in my stomach.  It’s just not me –
 it’s reading something that’s not real,' she explained.

Kick spent the summer supporting her half-brother following his mother's suicide in May.

Reflecting: Kick said that this sunner was 'rough' following the news of Mary Kennedy's suicide

Mary
 Kennedy, 52, hanged herself in a barn by the family's Westchester 
County home amid bitter divorce proceedings after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
won temporary custody of Conor and his three siblings.

Describing the chain of events, Kick, who is currently based in California, said: 'It
 was a rough summer.  Back in April, before Mary died, it seemed like 
things were slowing down in my life. 

'L.A. has a lot going on for an 
actor. But if you’re not happy, you’re not going to be taking advantage 
of any of it.'

Kick said at the time that Taylor was
 also a great source of strength for her half-brother, telling New York 
Magazine: 'Whatever makes Conor happy makes me happy. I love Taylor; 
they're pretty cute together.'

Last month Ted Kennedy Jr, also gave 22-year-old Taylor his seal of approval. He revealed that the singer has grown close to Robert F. Kennedy’s widow, Ethel, his grandmother.

'She’s a very open person…to people 
of all generations.

'As I just said, she’s a very welcoming person and 
she and Taylor have a genuine friendship.

'They
 love spending time together. They really like spending time with one 
another and, you know, they’re fascinated by each other,' Ted told Ok! 
magazine.

When asked if Ethel listens to Taylor’s music, Ted answered affirmatively: 'Yeah, she does. Of course!'
