Election defeat in 2015 could spell the end of the Labour party, its biggest union donor warned today.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said Ed Miliband was heading for catastrophe if he offered a ‘pale shade of austerity’ to voters at the general election.

And he threatened to withdraw millions of pounds in funding to Labour if it fails to draw up a radical, left-wing manifesto.

Unite has given almost £11million to Labour since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010, some 27 per cent of all donations received.

Speaking to a press gallery lunch today, Mr McCluskey told journalists it is ‘grumble time’ in the Labour party, with senior figures split between offering radical change and ‘shrinking the offer’ to limp over 35 per cent of the vote.

He said: ‘I can envisage a debate taking place if Labour lost the election next May. I fear for the future of the Labour party and so these are serious debates. At this point in time in our history we have to kind of consider all of those issues, at the moment, though that’s not on our agenda.’

He called for more powerful unions, a £1.50
 increase in the minimum wage and referenda on returning the railways 
and energy companies to public ownership.

Insisting
 he makes ‘no apology for Unite being engaged in political life’, Mr 
McCluskey hinted that he could switch support to a new workers’ party if
 Labour stumbled.

He claimed
 that with the economy growing but the future still uncertaing, David 
Cameron could replicate US President Barack Obama by comnvicng the 
electorate to stick with what they know.

Mr
 McCluskey said: ‘It is grumble time at the moment going on in the 
[Labour party]. People are getting slightly uneasy that there is not a 
cohesive vision. My understanding is that it is being worked on.

‘I am confident that what will emerge is a platform to take to the British electorate. I hope that it will be an alternative.

‘If it’s a pale shade of austerity then I believe Labour will be defeated at the next election.

‘Obama went to the electorate and said stick with me. That is exactly what the Prime Minister will be doing.

‘I believe the British electorate are of a mind unless there is a real alternative to say you know what, we best stick with the devil we know.

‘Ed’s challenge is - I hope he will pick this up sooner rather than later - is to prove he is on the side of ordinary people.’

There has been growing dissent in senior Labour circles about the lack of direction. Election co-ordinate Douglas Alexander has been briefed against as 'impossible' to work with while shadow chancellor Ed Balls is accused of blocking radical - expensive - reforms.

Scottish voters could back independence if they think the Tories will win the 2015 general election, Len McLuskey warned.

Unite has not taken sides in September's referendum campaign, as this would split the union - some 40 per cent of whose Scottish members voted SNP in 2011.

Labour's poll lead has slumped to just one point in recent days.

Mr McCluskey suggested that the prospect of a second term as Prime Minister for Mr Cameron could be enough to propel Scotland's voters into the Yes camp.

The Unite boss said: 'Remember we are talking about a nation that has kicked the Tories out of Scotland - there's only one (Conservative) Westminster MP up in Scotland.

'If, come September, the opinion polls down here are demonstrating that perhaps the Tories might get back into power, then that might have an influence on which way the Scottish people vote.

'They may take the view "I'm not putting up with another five years of Tory policies, we may as well vote for independence and take our chance now".'

Mr McCluskey went on: ‘Miliband has 
got to give hope to people. He has got to demonstrate that he will do 
something different in power.

‘At
 the moment  in the Labour party there is an argument going on between 
those who want a transformative programme and those who want to shrink 
the offer.

‘If we do that we
 will lose. But if we put forward hope then I believe that Labour will 
get back into power. The quicker he does that the better.’

In
 a stark warning to Mr Miliband, he insisted that Unite’s rules state it
 can only fund the Labour party – but that could change.

‘Can
 I ever envisage a rules conference voting to disaffiliate from Labour? I
 can, I can, and that’s a challenge to Ed Miliband because I believe the
 Labour party is at a crossroads, this is a watershed.

‘Labour
 consistently has to demonstrate that it is our voice, we created it. At
 the beginning of the last century, ordinary working people sat down tto
 create a party of labour so that we had a voice in the political arena.

‘Is
 Labour still that voice? I’m hoping the answer to that is yes, but we 
are at a stage in politics at the moment where just bumbling along in 
the old ways is not going to happen any more.’

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Len McCluskey is still calling the shots on Labour’s candidates, policies, and their whole future as a party. Today, he demanded more spending, more borrowing, and more taxes – exactly the same old Labour policies that got us into a mess in the first place. 

'What’s more, he threatened to cut off the money if he didn’t get his way. Ed Miliband is a puppet on Len McCluskey’s string: shoved around by the trade union bosses who pay Labour’s bills. And it’s hardworking people who would pay the price for that, with fewer jobs and a less secure economy.

‘Ed Miliband is simply too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, which means he would be too weak to run the country.’
