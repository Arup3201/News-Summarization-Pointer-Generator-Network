Wallace, the Chelsea defender on-loan at Vitesse Arnhem, has been released without charge after being questioned by police on ‘suspicion of a sexual offence’.

The 20-year-old, who has been loaned out to Fluminense and Inter Milan since he signed for Chelsea in January 2013, was with Vitesse’s squad for their trip to Excelsior and fined by the Dutch club.

‘Wallace won't be in the selection for the match against Excelsior,’ a statement from Vitesse read. 

Wallace is pictured in action for Chelsea during their pre-season tour of Indonesia back in July 2013 

‘The Brazilian defender was arrested last night in the centre of Arnhem on suspicion of an offence.

‘Based on the fact that he is to refrain from going out in the 48 hours before a match, Vitesse immediately decided Wallace will be out of the team and will receive a maximum fine.

‘Vitesse has no further announcements.’

While the Dutch club refused to comment on the nature of the offence which led to the arrest, a police spokesman is quoted by local media as saying it was 'sexual’.

‘We still don't know what exactly happened,’ police spokesman Paul Koetsier told RTL. ‘That must be found out during the investigation.

‘We can't make it more concrete than a suspicion of a sexual offence. Maybe there will me more information later today.’

Wallace is on a season-long loan at Vitesse. The Dutch outfit enjoy a close relationship with the Blues and the club’s owner Alexander Chigrinsky is an associate of Roman Abramovich.

Wallace, a Brazilian Under-20 international, made his debut for Jose Mourinho’s side during their summer tour of Asia in 2013 before his season on loan at Inter. He made only three appearances for the Serie A club before being sent to Vitesse.
