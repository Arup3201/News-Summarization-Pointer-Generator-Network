Paul Gambaccini is to return to BBC radio after he was cleared of historic allegations of sex abuse.

The veteran broadcaster, who spent almost a year on police bail, will be in the studio on Friday to record a new edition of his Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint.

The presenter, 65, will then return to his popular weekly Radio 2 show on Saturday November 14.

Paul Gambaccini, who has spent almost a year on police bail, will return to the BBC radio studios on Friday

The BBC has so far made no comment about the presenter’s future and declined to comment last night.

But one source who asked not to be named said: ‘Paul will be returning to both of the shows.

‘He will be in the studio on Friday to record Counterpoint and he will also record the subsequent heats. The taping on Friday is for broadcast at a later date but he will be back on Radio 2 next month.’

The DJ was arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic sex abuse cases.

Mr Gambaccini was accused of sexually assaulting two teenage boys in the 1980s. He has always protested his innocence but agreed to step down from presenting duties while police pursued their inquiries.

Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck was also arrested and released without charge as part of the operation

After his arrest in 2013 he compared his treatment to the musical The Scottsboro Boys which he had just seen. ‘It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences,’ he said. ‘Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’

Mr Gambaccini’s ordeal ended earlier this month when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against him and an unidentified 75-year-old man who was arrested on the same day.

The police’s treatment of the broadcaster and in particular the amount of time he spent on bail and unable to work has raised fresh concerns about the Operation Yewtree.

Mr Gambaccini was the 15th person arrested as part of the operation and one of ten released without charge. Critics of the inquiry have branded it a witch hunt. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, who was also arrested and released without charge, has called for accusers in sex assault cases to lose their anonymity.

Mr Gambaccini has so far declined to talk in depth about what he has described as ‘an horrific ordeal.’

In a statement he said: ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected.’

Mr Gambaccini, who entered into a civil partnership with actor Christopher Sherwood in 2012, has hosted Counterpoint since 2008.
