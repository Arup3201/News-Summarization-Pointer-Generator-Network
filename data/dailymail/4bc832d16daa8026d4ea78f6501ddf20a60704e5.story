Despite the bare-face and a touch of holiday frizz, Sarah Ferguson managed to look stylish on the arm of her friend Slavica Ecclestone as they strolled around Dubrovnik.

The ex-wife of F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone was born in Croatia and returns home for a holiday every year. But it's not often she's accompanied by a Duchess.

Slavica even introduced her friend to Dubrovnik Mayor, Andro Vlahušić, as they strolled around the popular tourist destination.

Fergie - sporting a bare-faced holiday look - stopped to meet friends for lunch

When approached by a local reporter, Fergie said of her friend: 'She does more than the Minister of Tourism. She always comes back to 
her country - she is a real ambassador.'

She also said that what she had seen so far in Dubrovnik was 
‘beautiful’. 

The glamorous pair arrived by yacht and then went for a walk down the Old city
 of Dubrovnik, and to meet the mayor.

Fergie, 54 and her 56-year-old friend giggled like teenagers as they strolled 
arm-in-arm through Stradun, the main cobbled street of Dubrovnik.

Croatian-born Slavica, looked younger than her years in a flowing maxi dress and over-sized sunglasses.

The friends stopped for an alfresco bite with where 
they attracted plenty of attention from onlookers, before heading home for a quiet dinner.

Say 'cheese': Fergie and her friend smiled broadly as they sashayed down the main street of Dubrovnik
