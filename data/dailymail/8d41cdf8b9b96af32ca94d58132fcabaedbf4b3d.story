Distasteful: Meaty Trumps' 'British Nonces' boasts 54 vile child-abuser playing cards

A 'disgusting' Top Trumps-style card game featuring Britain's most notorious paedophiles and child killers and ranking their crimes is available to buy online.

Meaty Trumps' 'British Nonces' boasts 54 vile child-abuser playing cards and participants must battle it out comparing attributes such as 'slipperiness' and 'cockiness'.

Among the pack are Jimmy Saville, Rolf Harris, Cyril Smith and Roy Whiting -  who was given a life sentence for murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000.

Other attributes on which players can out-trump their opponents are 'physical threat', 'offences'. 'nonceoriety' and 'remorse' - for which most score lowly.

Each card also includes a small bio giving players a taste of the sick crimes that destroyed many victims' lives - and the game is being advertised as suitable for 14-year-olds.

Underneath Cyril Smith's card, it reads: 'Big Cyril', Mr Rochdale, bully MP, glutton, predatory paedophile knighted on 1998, guest lecturer on the QE2, protected by MI5, never charged - organiser of industrial-scale child abuse.'

Smith receives a a slipperiness rating of 99 out of 100 and a physical threat rating of 95 - making him a sure winner for any player lucky enough to be dealt his card.

The pack features Sir Peter Hayman, a respected diplomat and Army officer who hid a secret life as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange.

Hayman also scores highly in the distasteful categories with a 100 out of 100 rating for 'cockiness'.

Also among the British Nonces pack is Max Clifford - jailed for eight years in May for a string of indecent assaults against girls and young women.

Clifford is notably scored a zero in the 'remorse' category following his antics during his trial - specifically when he jokingly snuck up behind a Sky News reporter who was reporting on the case outside Southwark Crown Court. 

When Clifford was sentenced, Judge Anthony Leonard referred to the footage and said: 'I find your behaviour quite extraordinary and a further indication that you show no remorse.' 

Jill Appleyard - abused by Clifford when she was just 14 years old - has slammed the Meaty Trumps creation.

She told the Sun: 'It's disgusting, especially selling it to teenagers. I was hoping people would take the subject of child abuse more seriously.'

The mother of two, 62, waived her anonymity to speak out about the abuse she suffered at the hands of the former PR guru. 

Yesterday Amazon removed the game from its website but it is still available for £8 on the Meaty Trumps site and on a website called Brown Cartel. 

Other Meaty Trumps sets include 'Killer Diseases', 'Recreational Drugs' and 'Tory Scum'.

The game's creator Vyvyan Lutyan told The Sun: 'The game is not intended to be fun, it is a grim game which holds up a satirical mirror the British Establishment.'

Speaking in an interview on the Brown Jewel website, he said: 'There are undoubtedly loads more noncing revelations to come out, I’m sure.

'I did intend to do a pack about the British Royal Family too but I can’t work out a way to make it gel yet. These first two packs really gel.'

He also tweeted: 'It is a grim game and a satirical piece of situationist art about the power structures which cultivate & protect paedos.'

Several child protection charities have also criticised the card game.

A spokesman for Kidscape said: 'The producers of such a disturbing 'game' have reached the depths of bad taste. 

'This item does not deserve to see the light of day, as it represents a gross insult to all the victims of child abuse and a complete disregard for their lifelong pain and suffering. 

'I would hope that everyone will have the good sense to steer clear of such abhorrent merchandise.' 

Other Meaty Trumps sets being promoted in the run up to Christmas are 'Tory Scum' and 'Ruinous Corporations'
