Tourists visiting Britain's capital may soon be able to dawdle for longer without upsetting the city's notoriously short-tempered drivers.

London is road testing 'intelligent' pedestrian crossings designed to read the requirements of the crossing throngs and offer a safer way to get from A to B.

Busy drivers will welcome the 'call cancel' technology, which cancels the traffic stop action if a pedestrian wanders off after pressing the button, while video cameras and sensors will automatically detect how many people are waiting as well as the speed of the crossing pedestrians.

Safety first: TfL is road testing intelligent crossings that read the requirements of the pedestrian traffic

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Transport for London (TfL) hope that the new pedestrian SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) system will eventually help make it easier and safer for millions people to cross the road throughout the capital.

The first trials of SCOOT will
take place on crossings outside busy Balham and Tooting Bec Underground 
stations this summer.

They are part of an ongoing road safety system in the city, including the recent Pedestrian Countdown technology which was successfully rolled out in 200 locations.

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 
'I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be 
trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians 
across the city.

The hi-tech systems will be trialled at two of London's busiest tube stations this summer

'This 
really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using 
21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around 
our great city.

'Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.'

TfL's Leon Daniels said of the crossings of the future: 'These new trials of pedestrian detection technology will allow our traffic signals to become even more intelligent, bringing huge benefits to those waiting to cross the road where there is heavy pedestrian demand.'

Depending on the outcome of the summer trials TfL hopes to develop the technology to use at other busy pedestrian areas such as sporting venues and busy high streets.
