A World War II veteran has spoken of his dismay after his home was targeted by burglars who stole a watch given to him as a memento of his days in the RAF.

Graham Furley, 91, has just been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year’s Honours for his charity fundraising.

He was asleep when his home was burgled by thieves who stole his wallet and iPhone as well as a watch with a gold Spitfire on the face - a reminder of his days as an RAF pilot.

Two other watches were also taken from his home in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

Mr Furley, who dropped paratroopers over North Africa in 1944 and flew mercy missions over Burma said yesterday of his stolen belongings: ‘The iPhone had everything I needed to know on it and I could always keep in touch.’

He added: ‘The police have been excellent - I hope they catch the perishers.’ The raid on Mr Furley’s house took place on New Year’s Day.

After forcing their way in through a side window, burglars took the Spitfire watch, which has a white metal strap, two watches with multi-dials and brown straps, a brown leather wallet, debit and credit cards, and the black Apple iPhone.

Police Sergeant Jo Fletcher said: ‘This gentleman is one of the country’s heroes, having courageously served in the Second World War.

‘This remarkable man put his life on the line to protect the nation and ensure freedom for future generations and then continued in his civilian life by devoting himself to charity work.’ He added: ‘For someone to break into his house is a despicable act and whoever has done this should be ashamed of themselves.

‘We are calling on anyone who knows anything about this burglary to come forward and help us catch those responsible.”

Former garage proprietor Mr Furley is a popular figure in Stroud where he is well known for towing a Santa’s sleigh behind his white VW Beetle to raise funds at Christmas time.

Last week he said he was ‘mystified’ at being awarded the BEM for his services raising thousands of pounds over several decades for Stroud Hospital.

His main job as a pilot in his early 20s was to deliver new planes over the Atlantic.

Then after the Second World War, his time in Burma as a pilot was a ‘turning point’ in his life.

Making aid drops to civilians, he spotted a village which had been razed to the ground. He urged his senior ranks to allow an extra drop.

‘We did so and tipped our wings on the way out, then a week later a man arrived with a wooden box he had made,’ said Mr Furley.

‘I was told he had walked for a week through the jungle to say thank you. I’ve always valued people saying thank you since then.’ Mr Furley’s daughter, Jane Oldmeadow, said it was worrying to think that her father could be honoured in recognition of his services to the community on one day and two days later have his home broken into.

Mrs Oldmeadow, 60, said: ‘He’s quite a strong character, so he’s quite cross about it - the fact that they’ve been in and taken his bits and pieces that matter to him.’ The Spitfire watch was a present from his daughter intended to honour his years as a wartime RAF pilot.

Anyone with information that could help the investigation should call police on 101 quoting incident 309 of January 1, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
