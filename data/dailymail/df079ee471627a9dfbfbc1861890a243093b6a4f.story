Gregg Wallace once christened himself 'the cooking woman's crumpet' and only last year boasted about how younger women throw themselves at him. 

These days, the Masterchef presenter is almost as well known for his relationship history as he is for his long-running slot on the cookery show. 

Today, the 50-year-old star announced that he is engaged to marry for a fourth time - to his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, 29.

Gregg Wallace, 50, claims that he has never been happier than with his new fiancée Anne-Marie Sterpini, 29. The couple have been together since March 2013. It is the fourth marriage for Gregg, who has openly spoken of his longing to find the woman he can settle down with forever 

The couple have declared themselves completely in love and friends of the stars say that he has never been happier. 

So has the greengrocer from Peckham finally found the woman he can settle down with? The pair will certainly be hoping that romantic history won't be repeating itself. 

After five decades, he has notched up three marriages, several very public declarations of love and thousands of column inches of mud-slinging from  exes.

More recently, he has got a bit of a reputation as a man with an eye for women several years his junior, with whom he indulges in very public Twitter flirtations.

But while that was not always his preference, Gregg has always managed to make waves with his relationship style. 

He married his first wife Christine in 1991, aged just 24, while he was an up-and-coming greengrocer doing business in London's Covent Garden. 

Gregg made his name on Masterchef, which he has been presenting alongside John Torode since 2005 

The couple got hitched in a 20-minute ceremony and celebrated with a meal in a pie and mash shop around the corner.

The marriage lasted just six weeks. 

In his autobiography, Life On A Plate, Gregg joked that the union was, 'possibly the shortest marriage in the world,' and admitted that he knew it was a mistake even before they said 'I do'. 

Two years later in 1993, he met his second wife Denise, who worked as a pastry chef in The Sanctuary Club in Covent Garden, and they had a whirlwind romance that resulted in their birth of their son Tom in 1994. 

Then three years later, their daughter Libby was born. 

Despite having two children, the couple didn't actually marry until 1999. 

They then divorced in 2004 after Gregg was caught having an affair with one of his employees.

Denise was so affected by the break-up that she was hospitalised for three months and Gregg was granted full custody of their two children.

She later said of the break-up: 'I was a nervous wreck. A complete mess.'

Denise pulled no punches in 2009, when she gave a warts-and-all account of her marriage to the TV star in the now-defunct News of The World. 

Gregg married his second wife Denise in 1999, the couple had two children together 

Gregg had previously claimed that Denise turned a blind eye to his philandering, so long as he was home before the children woke up in the morning. 

But in the interview, Denise claimed that Gregg even told her he had slept with a prostitute while they were together and that he used to collect spanking magazines, which he stored in fruit boxes at the back of their garage.

The emotions were clearly still raw even earlier this year, when she told The Mirror: 'I wish I never married that man. He has been the bane of my life.

'If you met him, you’d think he was a really nice guy. He’s very charming and personable. But the real Gregg is horrible.'

After their divorce in 2004, Gregg moved to Whitstable with their two children.

While he spoke briefly about girlfriends in interviews, they stayed out of the limelight. 

That all changed in 2009, when he met Heidi Brown, who at 27 was 17 years his junior. 

She tweeted the TV star, asking if he knew that he had been called a 'weird crush' in a magazine. 

He replied: 'Ever visit London? Give me a call, I'll buy you lunch.' 

A few weeks later, her took her as his date to the Baftas. 

Just a few months into the romance, Heidi quit her job as Head Of Biology at a school near Carlisle and moved into the Kent home that Gregg shared with his two children. 

Gregg credited third wife Heidi Brown with overhauling his diet and helping him to cut down his drinking, as well as providing a stable family life for his two children

He credited her with overhauling his diet and helping him to cut down his drinking, as well as providing a stable family life. 

He said in an interview at the time: 'She’s way out of my league, but she loves me. I couldn’t be without her. Never, ever, ever.'

The couple married in an extravagant wedding at five-star Coworth Park hotel in Ascot, Berkshire, and sold the pictures to Hello! magazine for £60,000. 

But just 14 months later, in March 2012, the couple announced that they were divorcing.

Gregg was so heartbroken over the split that he sought counselling and he claimed that if it was up to him, they would never have broken up. 

He told the Mail at the time: 'I’m gutted with what’s happened, but we’re very different people.

‘I want to be out on the town. I crave company. 

'I want to take my sexy, elegant wife to smart restaurants dressed up in her heels on my arm. 

'She likes the local Italian.'

Despite the split, Heidi stayed on for a while at their Whitstable home to look after Gregg's children, while he moved into a two-bedroom flat in London.  

It was just three months later, while he was still getting over his marriage to Heidi, that Gregg met glamour model Carla Franco.

The 26-year-old bumped into him at the Ideal Home Show Show in Glasgow and much like with Heidi, their flirting started on Twitter.

26-year-old Carla Franco first met Gregg at the Ideal Home Show Show in Glasgow, they dated for five months

She messaged the star afterwards, saying: 'Thought I would follow you, be rude not to.' 

The tweets escalated, with Gregg at one point telling Carla that she 'could be the next Mrs Wallace'. 

She later revealed that Heidi had actually been complicit in her relationship with the TV star and that she had even rung Carla to arrange travel and timings for her first date with Gregg. 

But the relationship only last five months, with Gregg ending the romance after admitting that he hadn't gotten over Heidi.  

In an interview with The Sun, Carla claimed that he had constantly compared her to his ex-wife.

He even told the Sunday Mirror while they were dating: 'Heidi was perfect. It’s not often you find a model who’s also a ­biology teacher. 

'She had everything, beauty and intelligence.' 

Just four months after his split with Carla, Gregg had once again fallen in love though - this time with his now-fiancee Anne-Marie Sterpini, now 28.

Anne-Marie, from Coventry, moved into the star's London home just a few months after they met

The couple also met on Twitter and Anne-Marie, from Coventry, moved into the star's London home just a few months later. 

They have now been together for more than a year and a half and Gregg claims that he has never been happier. 

Despite some negative headlines in August 2012, when Gregg punched a fellow party-goer at a dinner he was hosting  at the Wood Norton Hotel in Evesham, Worcestershire, for allegedly touching his girlfriend, the couple are said to be very much in love.

Gregg admitted that he can sometimes be embarrassed about the age gap between him and his new love and that he doesn't like to hold her hand in public places like shopping centres in case people stare, but other than that, he claims that he has finally found his one true love. 

He told The Daily Mail last year: '‘Do you know when I knew I really, really liked her? 

'It was when her piles of clothes, and the mess she was making in the flat, made me smile. It didn’t annoy me.

‘Everyone else’s stuff has annoyed me. I’ve spent my life thinking: “What is that doing in my wardrobe? Why is that on the window? That shouldn’t be on the floor".

‘With her, I like it.'
