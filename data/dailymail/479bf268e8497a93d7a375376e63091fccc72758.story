Formula One teams have bowed to public pressure, and sporting fairness, by agreeing to abandon double points for next year’s final race.

The rule was one of the sport’s most derided ever initiatives when it was introduced for the 2014 season, which ended last Sunday with Lewis Hamilton beating Nico Rosberg fair and square.

Had the awarding of double points in Abu Dhabi swayed the championship, it would have been one of the biggest travesties in any sport. Public scepticism would have blown up to global outrage.

As Hamilton said before the race: ‘It is a question of what is fair. To lose by double points would suck.’

The teams had long known this and on Wednesday the Strategy Group and the F1 Commission meeting in Geneva decided to ditch the gimmick for 2015.

The change needs to be ratified by the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council, but there is almost no chance that they will go against the teams on such a clear-cut matter. The final approval should come in the WMSC meeting in Doha on December 3.

The rule, which was only in place for one year, was a bastardised version of Bernie Ecclestone’s proposal that three races should carry double points. The teams did not like this suggestion and the fudge of final scoring at only the last race was introduced.

Ecclestone said of his plan: ‘One race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races. It means that somebody would have to have a 150-point advantage minimum to be sure they would win. The teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots.’

It is unlikely his three-race idea will be adopted, but that every race will count the same.

Double scoring was introduced to keep the last race alive after four championships had all been won by Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull. Last year he scorched to the title and the season faded away.

But that did not convince the public of the merits of double scoring. One fans’ survey said opposition to the rule ran at 96 per cent.
