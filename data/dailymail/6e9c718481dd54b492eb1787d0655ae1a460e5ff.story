A woman walking her three dogs on a public footpath had two of them ‘dognapped’ by the owners of a riding school after she refused to put them all on leads.

Emma Heslop was walking her pets in the countryside when she was approached by Mark Firby who was concerned about his horses in the field crossed by the path.

Miss Heslop’s Hungarian wirehaired vizsla Drummer was on a lead while another vizsla, Oscar, and her English springer spaniel Isla were walking to heel.

Emma Heslop, 35, was walking her dogs (from left; Isla, Oscar and Drummer) near Richmond, North Yorkshire when she claims she was approached by Mark Firby who was concerned about his horses in the field

The 35-year-old nurse said Mr Firby – who owned the land surrounding the public right of way – demanded that she put Oscar and Isla on leads and threatened to shoot them when she refused.

His wife Michelle then arrived in a Land Rover and, according to Miss Heslop, got into a struggle with her over Drummer. Mr Firby, meanwhile, bundled Isla into the couple’s 4x4.

Miss Heslop, worried about the springer spaniel, said she let go of Drummer to walk over to the vehicle to check on Isla – at which point Mrs Firby walked off out of sight with the vizsla.

The couple had also tried to catch Oscar but were unable to reach him.

By now Mr Firby had gone to call the police and Miss Heslop was able to free Isla from the Land Rover.

The Firbys returned Drummer to her after the police arrived and Miss Heslop put all three dogs on leads. Yesterday she said she had been ‘petrified’ by the altercation near Richmond, North Yorkshire. The Firbys own the nearby Hollies Riding School.

Miss Heslop, from Darlington, said: ‘It was as though they were taking previous anger with dog walkers out on me for no reason whatsoever.’ 

Miss Heslop claims that Mr Firby threatened to shoot her three dogs when she refused to put them on a lead while walking along the footpath (pictured). Police confirmed that an officer attended the incident

Mark and Michelle Firby own Hollies Riding School in Richmond, North Yorkshire, which advertises riding lessons on its website (above). They were said to be concerned for the welfare of their horses in a nearby field

She said the dogs had not been worrying any horses and the ‘dognapping’ had been aggressive and unnecessary.

‘There had been horses in the field further up but my dogs were under complete control and we had already passed the horses,’ Miss Heslop said. ‘I prefer to have the dogs off their lead so they can easily escape if the horses attempt to trample on them and injure me in the process.

The Countryside Code says dog owners must keep their pet under effective control.

Dogs should be on a lead or in sight and the owner must be confident it will return promptly on command.

The code also advises that it is good practice to keep pets on a lead near livestock and horses.

Legally, dogs are regarded as a ‘usual accompaniment’ to anyone using a public right of way. But dogs and their owners are meant to stay on the line of the route.

It is an offence for a dog to be at large in a field in which there are sheep.

As with any property, stealing a dog is illegal. But a livestock owner or the landowner can shoot a dog if they believe it is the only reasonable way of stopping it worrying livestock.

‘It was just a bizarre experience and the law states as long as the dogs are under control I had done nothing wrong.

‘When the police turned up they defused the situation. I just feel quite confused about the whole incident and why it got to that point.

‘I was getting verbally abused throughout and it was a very unpleasant situation.

‘After the threat from Mr Firby I was worried that my dogs were going to get shot.’

She added: ‘I am quite annoyed by it all. In my 15 years experience of walking dogs I have never come across people like this. To think that someone would physically try to take the leads out of my hand is crazy.

‘I’m just relieved I got my dogs back safe and sound in the end.’

When asked about the incident, Mrs Firby said: ‘I don’t want to get into the tittle tattle of it all really. The dogs were well away from the owner and we saw it in our right to act the way we did.

‘We are not fazed by what has been said about this.’

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed that an officer had attended the incident on June 28, but neither party made a complaint.
