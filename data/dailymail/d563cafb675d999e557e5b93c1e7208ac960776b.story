A woman has told of her ordeal in a Dubai prison after being imprisoned for having sex outside marriage.

Rebecca Blake, from Surrey, was jailed for a crime she did not commit and ended up serving 95 days in a 'filthy' cell.

Speaking to the Sunday Express, the 30-year-old said she was forced to lie about being married or she would face a more severe punishment for adultery and could have been stoned to death.

Embarrassing: Rebecca Blake has said how difficult it was to tell her parents of the charges

The recruitment consultant was accused of having sex in the back of a taxi with her friend Conor McRedmond 28, from Tullamore, Co. Offaly and they spent a year fighting the allegations.

Ms
 Blake said her lawyer told her to keep the fact she was already 
technically married, from six years ago, a secret as if the authorities 
knew she was married she could be charged with the more serious crime of
 adultery.

Now back in
 Britain, Ms Blake said: 'It feels like a surreal nightmare. I still 
wake up in the night panicking, thinking I'm back in that cell.'

Blake and McRedmond  were arrested on May 4 last year after meeting at a brunch then going on a drinking binge - getting a taxi together at 10pm.

Taxi driver Qaiser Khan,
 30, claimed within minutes of getting in, Blake had taken her top off 
and was writhing on top of McRedmond while ‘making the sounds of a woman
 having sex’.

He told prosecutors earlier this year: 
‘They kept having sex for four minutes. The man’s shirt was open, his 
trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any 
underwear.’

The taxi driver alleged Blake offered
him ‘a lot of money’ to tell prosecutors they had been kissing rather 
than having sex, but he refused.

They said the allegations had been made up after they rowed with the taxi 
driver about taking a longer route home.

Their lawyer Shaker 
al Shammary yesterday said the statements of the two witnesses were 
inconsistent, adding: ‘They threatened to complain about the taxi driver
 and he beat them to it – yet there is no mention of their dispute in 
the Supreme Court judgment.

‘The medical records show what the witnesses said was not true but this was not taken into account in the ruling.’

Blake was 
sacked from her £100,000-a-year job as a recruitment consultant for 
Manpower in Dubai following the scandal

McRedmond had said earlier this year: ‘We find ourselves in
 exactly the same position we were in after the original verdict but 
thousands of pounds poorer.

‘Any
 court in the world would accept the medical evidence above all else. I 
love Dubai and wanted to carry on living here but I am left without a 
choice.’

There were 
fears their failure to clear their names was part of a crackdown from 
Dubai authorities on expats flouting their strict rules.

Vince
 Acors and Michelle Palmer, a British couple caught having sex on a 
beach, were treated more leniently in 2008 when they were convicted on 
the same charge of indecency and ordered to serve three months in 
prison, but received a suspended sentence on appeal.
