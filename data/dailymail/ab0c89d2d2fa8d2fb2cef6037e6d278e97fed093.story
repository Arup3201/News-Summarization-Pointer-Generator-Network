Leading British doctors have called for the Government to remove PIP breast implants fitted to 50,000 women following damning new research that shows their shells are faulty.

The casings are more likely to degrade than those used in others – leaving women given PIPs at risk of silicone leaking into their bodies, the research showed.

The doctors who conducted the research, including nanotechnology professor Alexander Seifalian and top plastic surgeon Professor Peter Butler, now say all PIPs should be removed.

Leaking risk: Surgeons operate to remove a PIP implant in France

Nigel Mercer, former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said last night: ‘If you have problems with the outer shell of an implant, then it will act like a sieve and the silicone will just leak out.

‘The batch testing for these implants was useless so we don’t know which women could be most at risk – it’s a lottery. I’d say to women: Have them out.’

The scandal over French-manufactured PIP implants erupted in 2011 when it was shown that they were more than twice as likely to rupture than other implants and that they were filled with industrial-grade silicone used in mattress production.

Women whose implants burst have complained of swollen lymph nodes, lumps and pains in their breasts.

But despite French authorities agreeing to remove the implants from all women fitted with them as a preventative measure, officials in the UK have continued to insist there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine removal.

Instead, the NHS will pay for women to have them removed only if specialists believe that there is  a ‘clinical need’ to do so and if  the private clinics that fitted  them refuse to remove them.  The NHS will not pay to have  them replaced. But the latest research has fuelled further calls for the Government to introduce a blanket policy to remove all PIPs because of the risks.

The study examined 18 PIP implants removed from patients between January and March 2012.

The researchers, from the Royal Free Hospital  in North London and University College London, tested the strength of the material in the PIPs.

The study found the shells were ‘significantly weaker’ than other brands.

Toxic fears: A woman calls for fair treatment over implants

Senior surgeons last night said the 
study should be taken seriously amid claims that the NHS has been 
failing to address the needs of women. Tim Goodacre, a member of the 
Government-commissioned panel investigating the PIP scandal and chair of the professional standards committee of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (BAPRAS), said: ‘This is very good research based on good science which gives us a better understanding as to why the shells are rupturing.

‘BAPRAS’s view remains that the PIPs will all need  to come out eventually, like any implant – just not in a short-term rush.’

About 95 per cent of women with PIPs had them fitted by a private clinic, while a minority of operations were carried out on the NHS, mostly for breast reconstruction following cancer.

Plastic-surgery chain Harley Medical Group insisted it could not afford to remove implants from patients and recently went into administration to avoid potential legal claims. The French manufacturer of the implants also closed shortly after the scandal broke.

The NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, is looking at whether the cosmetic surgery industry needs to be more effectively regulated as a result of the scandal.

Jan Spivey, from the PIP Action Campaign, said many women hoping to have their PIPs removed on the NHS were being turned away by GPs or discouraged by specialists. ‘Women’s psychological trauma and needs are totally ignored. Some women cannot afford the high costs of private surgery and are having to live with the terror. It’s totally unacceptable.’

A statement from the Department of Health said: ‘This study has revealed nothing new. Our expert group report, which was published in June, made it clear that PIP implants were more likely to rupture than others.

‘Extensive testing of the PIP gel material has not revealed anything that could cause a long-term threat to human health – they are not toxic and not carcinogenic.’

Shadow Public Health Minister Diane Abbott said: ‘The Government has to put pressure on private companies to remove implants from any woman who requests it.’
