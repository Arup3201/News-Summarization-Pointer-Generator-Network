Queens Park Rangers will lay on free coaches to fans for their night match at Everton to combat the lack of public transport available.

Sky and the Premier League came in for criticism after announcing four Monday Night Football matches in December where travelling supporters were unable to use trains.

The last train to leave Liverpool for London and arrive on the same night of December 15 is at 8.48pm. The club have reacted by arranging free coach travel.

They have done the same for the match at Swansea on December 2, also offering reduced-priced tickets. Premier League clubs are each allocated a £200,000 pot to aid the experience for away supporters.

A QPR spokesman said: ‘R’s fans have shown incredible support on the road already this season, and in the lead up to Christmas, the club want to make travelling to the Liberty Stadium and Goodison Park as affordable as possible.’
