When I wrote in this column recently that Manchester United are on the brink of something very special under Louis van Gaal, I didn't expect it to happen this season.

But right now they look like they're the only team capable of catching the top two and that means they are in the title race.

Not many would have thought that possible after the 5-3 defeat at Leicester. But as I said after that game, United were brilliant going forward, and crumbled after a shocking refereeing decision gave Leicester a way back into the game.

That experience built character. As Ronald Koeman pointed out after the final whistle, United handled mistakes and setbacks better than Southampton did on Monday night.

United were atrocious at times, they could barely pass the ball to each other and yet they won the game.

Their strengths are in their finishers – Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie don't need many chances - and that worked in United's favour at St Mary's. There were only three attempts on goal from United – the lowest in the Premier League this season. And the lowest number created by a United side in a game for 11 years.

But they took two of them. That is impressive, and it gave them three points.

With Sergio Aguero out injured for a while, Manchester City will need to answer questions. Chelsea need to show they can recover from a setback and respond positively.

United's injury list could ease significantly soon – Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind in particular could make a difference. They are also set to spend another small fortune in January, which should improve them.

Manchester United are not playing well, they are nowhere near their peak performance and yet they are third in the table, having won five games in succession, and having only lost once – to the champions – in 10 games, since that defeat to at Leicester.

There are three men who I believe are chiefly responsible for United being in the title race.

1) Louis van Gaal

He's a class act, and he's always ready to make difficult decisions when necessary – like taking Paddy McNair off in the first half at Southampton when he lacked confidence and was making too many mistakes. 

That was bold and brave but it worked for United. At the same time it sent a message to the rest of the United players that they need to be totally on top of their game. Van Gaal needed to make the change, but he taught the United squad a lesson at the same time.

2) Wayne Rooney

A captain, a leader, and a man ready to do whatever it takes to get United back to where they were before Sir Alex Ferguson retired. He is proving himself to be a worthy talisman for club and country and it's clear the rest of the players respect him. 

His tireless running with the ball as the Saints game drew to a close took the pressure off United at the back and gave them an outlet in the opposition half.

3) Michael Carrick

His calm and composure have been crucial during this winning run. Since he returned to the side he has relaxed everyone around him. He will always accept the ball, always be available and he never hides. That is exactly what an under-pressure defence needs.

Carrick is a team-mate who will always help you out. Louis van Gaal must be so relieved to have him fit and in the side. The added bonus is that the manager knows he can also trust Carrick at centre-half.

Can Manchester United win the title? I wouldn't put money on it. But it would be the most impressive turn around in Premier League history if they did.

To even be talking about United as title contenders shows what an amazing job Van Gaal has done already.

While some are busy trying to convince themselves the loan deal for Radamel Falcao was a terrible error from Manchester United, Van Gaal has led them up to third in the table. The United haters must be raging in their sleep!
