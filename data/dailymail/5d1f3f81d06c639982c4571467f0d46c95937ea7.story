When this horse rejoined his herd made up like a zebra, they all thought he was taking them for a ride.

But in fact, it was a cunning ruse to hoodwink horseflies and enjoy a peaceful, bite-free summer.

His owner Claudia Wide daubed the black stallion with cattle-paint on her farm in Weye, in Germany, in a novel attempt to protect it from the blood-sucking insects.

She came up with the trick after learning that zebras in the wild never get bitten by the hungry pests, which have a nasty bite and spread lethal blood diseases.

The revelation was first made by researchers from Lund University in Sweden last year, when they realised black and white stripes are unappetising to horseflies because they reflect light in a certain way.

After months of forensic testing, they discovered that the bugs far prefer the 'flat' light produced by much darker coats.

Tests were carried out in Hungary 
using life-sized cardboard cut-outs of horses painted white, brown, and 
with stripes and spots.

Hate stripes: Horseflies have a nasty bite and spread lethal blood diseases

The models were coated with oil and glue to trap the insects.

'We
started off studying horses with black, brown or white coats,' lead 
researcher Susanne Akesson from Lund University told the BBC at the 
time.

'We found that in the black and brown horses, we get horizontally polarised light. From a white coat, you get unpolarised light.'

Akesson explained that horse flies don’t like this type of light but surprisingly, in experiments, were found to hate striped coats even more.

And the narrower the stripes, the more they kept away.

She said: ‘We were expecting to find that a striped coat, having half of the coat covered with a black surface and half white to show intermediate attraction to the horseflies, but in fact it was as good or even better than the white surface in terms of attracting few horse flies.’

Dr Akesson acknowledged that there 
are competing theories about why zebras evolved stripes, such as 
camouflage against predators, thermoregulation, a way of recognising 
other herd members and to stimulate grooming, but she argues that they 
have not been critically tested.

Horse flies, however, can kill - which would provide the necessary evolutionary pressure for stripes.

She
added: 'We think we have a strong case because tabanides [horse flies] 
transfer diseases to their hosts, some of which are lethal. And their 
bites are irritating and will disturb grazing mammals.'

Cheeky! The stallion is now so comfortable he is up to his old tricks, picking food from Claudia's pockets

Share the paint: The paint takes about thirty minutes to apply, leaving time for Claudia to paint one or two of the other animals too

The paint is in fact a ruse to prevent horseflies from biting the horse
