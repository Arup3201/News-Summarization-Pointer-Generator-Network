Court victory: Jennifer Jones sparked a nationwide hunt when she went on the run with her children

A mother who sparked a nationwide hunt when she went on the run with her children wept tears of joy yesterday after fighting off an attempt by her ex-husband to have her jailed.

The ruling in Jennifer Jones’s favour came after one of her five children, 16-year-old Jessica, told the presiding judge at the High Court she would rather die than go to Spain to live with her father.

Ms Jones’s triumph this week was the latest episode in a long-running and upsetting chain of events triggered by the collapse of her marriage to Spanish army officer Tomas Palacin Cambra in 2008.

The family made headlines in 2012 when schoolteacher Ms Jones and her new partner John Williams took four of her five children on the run on the day they should have been returned to their father at Cardiff railway station.

Although the youngest two, Eva, ten, and David, eight, now live with their father and eldest sister Sara, 17, in Spain, Jessica and Tomas, 14, refused to go back and last night repeated their vow never to return.

In court this week, Ms Jones faced an application by her ex to have her jailed for failing to comply with court orders for the children to be returned to Spain.

Jessica’s account of the family’s troubles during the hearing moved the presiding judge, Sir James Munby, to say it was ‘one of the saddest things’ he had ever heard.

The teenager, who is due to sit her first GCSE exam at her school in Llanelli on May 10, told the court she wanted to stay in South Wales with her mother and Tomas.

She said: ‘I’m not going back. I’d rather die than go back’ – and confirmed she had told police officers in 2012 that if she was forced to return to Spain she would ‘top herself’.

Her father’s barrister, James Turner QC, 
asked her why she did not want to go back to Spain. ‘I am scared of my 
father,’ she replied.

The slight figure, wrapped in a 
charcoal-coloured cardigan and with metal braces on her teeth, added: 
‘He has really bad tempers. I want to be with my mum.’

Mr Palacin Cambra was not in court for the three-day hearing.

Mr Turner asked Jessica how she would feel if her mother went to prison, as her father’s court application was seeking.

‘I’d have a breakdown,’ she replied. ‘There is nothing my mum could have said or done to have made us go back to Spain. I don’t understand why he would want to put mum into jail. This is just  too much.’

On the final day of the hearing on Friday, Sir James revealed how deeply moved he had been by the account Jessica had given about the breakdown of her relationship with Sara.

She had told the court they had once been ‘really close’ but that now her older sister would not even answer her phone calls.

She said: ‘I miss Sara so much but I think she just wants to ignore  me now.’

Her comments prompted Sir James, who is head of the High Court family division, to say later: ‘I think one of the saddest things I have ever heard in a courtroom was Jessica explaining why and how her relationship with Sara had changed.’

Dismissing the application to have their mother jailed, Sir James said his full and detailed judgment would follow ‘in due course’.

After the hearing, Ms Jones, 48, said she felt ‘pleased and relieved’. But she added: ‘This victory, if that is what it is, feels very hollow, because at the heart of this terribly sad matter are five children who are no longer together as a family as they should be.

‘It is so hard on all of them. They should be together, playing and smiling and doing all the things siblings do together. I will never give up fighting to reunite them.’
