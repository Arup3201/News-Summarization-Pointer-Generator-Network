Unmasked: Max Findlay, a father-of-two, who became an internet sensation when he was filmed in Richmond Park chasing after his dog Fenton

A dog walker who became an internet sensation when he was filmed running after his black Labrador Fenton as he charged after deer has been unmasked.

Father-of-two Max Findlay, an editorial consultant, said 'I just want to move on' after the footage, recorded by a 13-year-old boy, went viral on YouTube.

In the 47-second clip the runaway dog  chases after the herd of deer in Richmond Park, London, completely ignoring the increasingly desperate shouts of his owner.

Mr Findlay's furious attempts to stop Fenton are in vain as the 
frightened animals stampede across a road, forcing cars to stop and
leaving an exasperated Mr Findlay swearing in despair.

The dog owner has apparently not been seen walking his pet in the park since the incident.

Jake Goodyear, 13, from Holloway, north London, filmed the video while visiting the park with his father Ali last month.

When questioned on Fenton’s antics Mr Findlay said: 'I don’t really want to add anything to the zillions of words already out there. I'd rather just leave the story where it is and move on.'

Mr Findlay is thought to be worried about facing sanctions from the Royal Parks for failing to keep his pet under control.

He is a former barrister, legal journalist and leader writer for the Observer and Financial Times who lives in a large detached house close to Richmond Park.

After spending the early part of his career writing for the broadsheets and various legal journals he set up his own consultants Max Findlay Associates in 1988, advising companies how to write effectively.

According to his website he has worked with government departments, accountants, universities and multinational companies.

Friends of Mr Findlay said he was considering renaming his dog.

In his sights: Benton, or is it Fenton, bounds after the herd of deer in Richmond Park

On the run: The terrified deer flee from Fenton as Max Findlay's shouts become increasingly desperate

One said: 'Max is mortified. Fenton’s a lively dog, but he’d never done this before. Max won't be taking him back to Richmond Park any time soon and is considering giving him a new name if the fuss goes on.'

The clip quickly inspired a number of spoof videos as well as a ringtone and a range of t-shirts.

A remix of the video by The Hoxton’s is now an unlikely contender for the Christmas number one and will battle it out with Gareth Malone’s choir of military wives for the prize.

The song is called Benton! Jesus Christ! - a reference to the name originally thought  to belong to the dog, and Mr Findlay's final furious outburst.
