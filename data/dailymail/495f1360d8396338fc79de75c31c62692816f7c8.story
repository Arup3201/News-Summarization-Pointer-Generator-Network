A beautician lived a luxury lifestyle after her boxer boyfriend turned to drug dealing to pay for her dream wedding, a court heard today.

Natasha Hugh, 27, is accused of spending almost £40,000 of illegal drug money on her lavish lifestyle - buying a pre-wedding holiday in Barbados to get a tan, luxury bridal wear and dental work.

Hugh is facing the jail for allegedly using her husband's crime fortune to fund the opulent wedding ceremony with chocolate fountains and casino tables.

But her extravagant life came to an end when her 29-year-old husband Justyn - a former light-heavyweight champion boxer - was jailed for running an international cocaine ring.

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'This is money laundering.

'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh.'

Pretty Hugh splashed thousands of pounds in her home town of Newport, South Wales, during a four year spending spree.

A court heard she had a £10,477 wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury four star golf, spa and leisure hotel near Cardiff.

The court heard how Hugh allegedly spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,435 on bridal accessories ahead of the ceremony.

The events manager at the hotel saw her as she got ready for her reception - paying her hairdresser in cash taken out of a 'blue gym bag' bulging with notes.

Hugh is also accused of paying for a £3,900 holiday to Barbados using cash, staying at the Almond Causarina hotel on the Caribbean island.

The mum-of-one allegedly bought a Mini Sytner with almost £5,000 paid in cash - she later exchanged the car for a £19,570 Mini Countryman.

She allegedly spent £4,000 on hairdressing equipment for a beauty salon she set up called Glamorous U.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how she also spent £13,000 putting her child in nursery.

Mr Griffiths added: 'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash instalments.

'She knew or should have known the money had come from crime.'

Ex Welsh light-heavyweight champion Justyn was jailed earlier this year after running a £500,000 operation to bring cocaine into South Wales.

He was jailed for 11 years for heading up a drugs gang which had links to Albania and the Netherlands.

A court heard he worked at a car valet business earning up to £11,964 a year - although he made extra money from his boxing.

His wife worked at Admiral Insurance before opening her beauty salon where the court heard her income at it's highest was £12,154 a year.

In police interview beautician Hugh repeatedly denied that her husband was involved in illegality. 

Hugh told officers: 'He doesn't make money dealing drugs - I don't know anything about him dealing drugs.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard mother-of-one Hugh told officers she didn't pay for her lavish wedding in cash - but then changed her story.

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths told the court: 'She said none of the reception was paid for in cash.

'She said didn't remember how much the reception cost, she couldn't remember where she bought her wedding dress from or how much it cost.

'And she said she did her own hair for the wedding because she was a hair dresser.'

Hugh changed her story in later police interviews to claim the wedding and honeymoon were paid for in cash - but by her father after he sold his house.

But Mr Griffiths told the jury her father didn't receive any money for the sale of his house until after the wedding date. 

She is accused of spending £39,490.08 between December 1, 2009 and September 1, 2013. She denies possessing and converting criminal property.

The trial continues. 

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Hugh's maximum earnings before opening her salon was less than £13,000.
