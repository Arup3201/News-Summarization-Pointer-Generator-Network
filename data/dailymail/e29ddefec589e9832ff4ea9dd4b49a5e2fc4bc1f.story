A 17-year-old girl has been arrested for throwing booze-fueled parities after a popular classmate was killed in a late-night car crash, police say.

The town of Glastonbury, Connecticut, has been mourning Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, 17, since her SUV ran off the road and slammed into several trees on July 14. 

Police say they handed down the charges in connection with Modlesky's late-night  crash, but have not said whether she was coming home from a party thrown by the teenage suspect.

The girl was arrested this weekend for 'supplying alcohol to minors,' a charge usually reserved for the adults who furnish the alcohol for parities.

Tragic: Elisabeth Jane Modlesky, 17, was killed July 14 when she crashed her SUV into an oak tree

Star: Modlesky was one of the leading point scorers on the Glastonbury High School lacrosse team and was looking forward to her senior year, her coach says. She is seen here with her mother

Horrific: Police say Modlesky lost control of her vehicle and slammed into a series of oak trees

Police said they charged the teenage girl - the same age as Modlesky - because they wanted to 'send a message' to other teens in the town about the consequences of drinking, the Hartford Courant reports.

'The bottom line with this arrest is we are hoping to get a message out there that we are taking this seriously,' Police Chief David Caron said.

'It's a little disappointing when an incident like this happens and we've lost a student. But we are going to follow up and we are going to take this seriously.'

Six teenagers from the town of 34,000 have died in car crashes this summer.

Police will not say whether they believe alcohol was a factor in Modlesky's fatal crash last month. They say they are awaiting the results of toxicology reports. 

However, the teen girl who was arrested this weekend, his charged with throwing two parities at her house last month while her parents were out of town.

The 17-year-old girl arrested this weekend had thrown two parities while her parents were out of town, police said

Devastating: Modlesky is seen here with her parents as an infant. She was just 17 when she was killed last month

Proud father: Modlesky, seen here with her father, was 'cheerful and bright' and 'any family would have been happy to have her,' says her lacrosse coach

Police are still awaiting the results of toxicology reports to determine whether Modlesky was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash

Police say her arrest is connected to Modlesky's crash.

Modlesky was a star of the Glastonbury High School lacrosse team - one of the top scorers - and was looking forward to her senior year.

'She was an extremely cheerful, pleasant kid,' Coach Danny McCarthy told the Courant.

'She had a great attitude and was a leader and motivator. Smart girl, extremely polite. She loved the game and it's just a shame - each time something like this happens, you can't help but think of your own children.'
