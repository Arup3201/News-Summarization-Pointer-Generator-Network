A powerful new anti-bullying campaign sees a group of teenagers read out the heartbreaking social media messages they sent to their friends - who committed suicide after being bullied.

The emotional video begins with the students reading sentimental messages from their phones before it is shockingly revealed that they were written to their friends after they had taken their own lives.

The thought-provoking 'Too Late' campaign created by Deutsch, N.Y for Champions Against Bullying aims to encourage teenagers to be kind to their peers while they still have the chance.

The video opens with a young man reading a message from his phone, which reads: 'You're beautiful and unique in every way.'

A teenage girl then follows with her own message, reading: 'Happy 15th to my beautiful best friend. I love you with all of my heart.'

Another adds: 'That big smile of yours made my day.'

In an heart-wrenching twist, it is then revealed that the messages were written on the real social media accounts of teens who took their own lives after being bullied by their peers.

Too late: Teens read messages posted to their friends' social media accounts after they had committed suicide in a new PSA created by Deutsch, N.Y for the nonprofit Champions Against Bullying

Filled with regret: 'Goodnight Jessica. When I wake up tomorrow morning, I'll be thinking of you,' one girl wrote on her friend's social media account after she had taken her own life

The same teenage boy from the beginning of the clip then returns to say, 'Everyone misses you. I just wish you were here to see it. I love you.'

The video ends with a reminder for teens to 'Be Nice. Now.'

The National Association of School Psychologists estimates that more than 3.2 million youths from sixth to tenth grade are victims of moderate or serious bullying each year.

Champions Against Bullying is a nonprofit dedicated to creating a society where children and teens are able live without fear and violence from their peers.

Actress and USA Director of the organization Leigh Rachel Faith wrote on the site that she and Founder and Crisis Intervention Specialist Alexandra Penn are proud to announce the heartfelt PSA, noting that the 'response has been incredible'.
