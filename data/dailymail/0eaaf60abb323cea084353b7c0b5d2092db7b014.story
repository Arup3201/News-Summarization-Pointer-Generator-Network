Tougher tests await Alan Pardew, but he passed his first assignment as Crystal Palace manager with minimal fuss.

Having only been confirmed as the club's new boss on Saturday morning, the safe option for Pardew would have been to sit out Sunday's FA Cup third-round tie at non-league Dover and leave caretaker Keith Millen to face the flak if Palace were to fall victim of a giant-killing.

But having taken charge of one training session since arriving from Newcastle, Pardew fronted-up on Sunday, taking his place in the dugout to oversee a 4-0 victory — Palace's first win in nine matches.

He said: 'I had a couple of texts from friends saying 'why the hell have you put yourself up for that one? Couldn't you have waited a couple of days and let it ride by?'.

'I think it's important when you secure your contract, you start working from that minute. There was no hesitation on my part to make sure that we did some work on the team and prepare ourselves for Dover as we would if it were a Premier League team.'

Pardew is keeping his counsel on the turbulent final months of his reign at St James' Park; his press conference ahead of the clash against Tottenham on Saturday could make for interesting viewing.

But the dark days of abuse from Newcastle fans were a distant memory yesterday as his new supporters gave him the warmest of welcomes.

'It was lovely. I'm fortunate that they already have a special bond with me from my playing days,' said Pardew. 'I'm going to promise them two things. One, we're going to put the ball at risk. Two, we're going to have a go. I think that hopefully will keep the fans in that frame of mind until the end of the season because we won't stay up without them.'

Off the pitch it didn't get off to the smoothest start — his side forced to walk the final yards of their journey yesterday because the driver couldn't manoeuvre the coach up the hill to the Crabble Stadium.

Thankfully for Pardew, matters on the pitch weren't such an uphill struggle.

Dover keeper Andrew Rafferty denied Glenn Murray three time inside the opening eight minutes before Scott Dann headed home Wilfried Zaha's cross.

The central defender was at it again in the 33rd minute, thumping another header past Rafferty from Barry Bannan's corner.

Dwight Gayle and substitute Kevin Doyle made absolutely sure of victory with well-taken goals.
