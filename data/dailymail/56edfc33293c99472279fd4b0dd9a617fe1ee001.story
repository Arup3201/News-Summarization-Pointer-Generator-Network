Fancied a little sunbathing today? Maybe break out the BBQ? Well, tough, it's time to grab your brolly.

After sweltering in temperatures that touched on 32C (89.6F), the UK is now braced for torrential downpours and storms that will could cause flash flooding across large parts of the country.

The Environment Agency warned that up to 30mm (1.2in) of rain could fall in an hour in some areas.

The agency says that almost every county in England and Wales is at 'medium' risk of flooding today, and has issued 59 flood alerts, warning people to be prepared.

Sound and fury: This stunning picture shows lightning strikes alongside Brighton Pier

After the hottest day of the year, heavy rain and poor visibility has hit West Yorkshire. The Environment Agency has issued 59 flood alerts, warning people to be prepared

The majority of these are in the Midlands, the South East and the South West.

In a separate 'amber' warning of rain for England, eastern and central Wales, the Met Office warns that heavy, thundery showers that developed overnight will move northwards during the day.

Large amounts of energy in the atmosphere will lead to torrential downpours, frequent lightning, large hail and strong gusts of wind.

The Met Office said: 'Not everywhere within the warning area will see thunderstorms, and indeed some spells of warm sunshine are expected at times, but where thunderstorms do form, some torrential downpours are likely with frequent lightning, large hail and locally strong gusts.

'Significant flooding is possible where these do occur from surface water as well as from small, fast-responding watercourses. The public should be prepared for the risk of disruption from any of these elements.'

There is still, however, a 'yellow' warning of a heatwave for the UK today, advising people to be 'alert and ready'. The Met Office said there was a 60 per cent chance of a heatwave continuing until tomorrow morning, with high levels of humidity.

John Curtin, director of incident management at the Environment Agency, said: 'Intense heavy rainfall this weekend brings a surface water flood risk for England throughout the weekend.

Flooding can happen very quickly and the public are urged to keep checking local weather forecasts and the environment Agency website for information on a regular basis.

'We will continue to monitor the situation closely and support local authorities, who will respond to any reports of surface water flooding. We will also continue to monitor river levels closely and issue warnings where flooding is likely.'

Storms hit large parts of the South East of England early yesterday morning, with a reported 3,000 lightning strikes.

Gemma Plumb, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'Today we have got some heavy and severe thunderstorms continuing to spread north across the UK. Most of the UK is going to see some heavy showers or long spells of rain during the day and severe thunderstorms.

'These could give hail, gusty winds and very frequent lightning strikes.

'It will not be as hot as yesterday, but it will still be very warm and humid. East Anglia could still see temperatures as high as 27C (80.6F) to 29C (84.2F), Kent will see 27C (80.6F) or 28C (82.4F), rather than the 32C (89.6F) it had yesterday.'

Heavy rain did not deter golf spectators from turning out in force to watch an historic third day of the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.

With an amber weather warning in place for heavier rain and potential thunderstorms the unprecedented decision was made to operate a two-tee start - with players in groups of three going off from the first and 10th tees in a bid to avoid the worst of the weather - for the first time in the tournament's long and illustrious history.

A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said airlines were cancelling 20 per cent of flights for a two-hour period today due to the thundery weather.

She said: 'There is severe weather forecast at Heathrow with a 70 per cent risk of thunderstorms, lightning strikes and hail storms. During thunderstorms the number of aircraft that can take off and land each hour is reduced.

'We have therefore requested that airlines reduce their flight schedule by 20 per cent between 4pm and 6pm. Passengers due to travel on July 19 are urged to check the status of their flight with their airline before travelling to the airport.'

This is the devastating damage caused after a bungalow was completely gutted by a ferocious fire which was sparked by a bolt of lightning

FFFThis is the devastating damage caused after a bungalow was completely gutted by a ferocious fire which was sparked by a bolt of lightning.

Firefighters were called to the empty property on Tythe Barn Lane in Solihull, West Midlands, at 4.43am today.

Shocking pictures taken at the scene show the bungalow ablaze as fire crews battle bravely to put out the raging inferno. Images taken after the fire was put out then show the devastating damage done to the gutted property, which was being renovated.

The roof has been completely destroyed by the blaze, and blackened debris can be seen strewn across the rooms.

Taking to their Twitter account, Solihull Fire said the intense heat caused a radiator to explode forcing crews to withdraw for safety. It said: 'This is the danger crews faced when entering in breathing apparatus to fight the fire & search the property

'Intense heat caused explosion forcing crews to withdraw for safety, later found to be this radiator on the 1st floor.'

West Midlands Fire Service said nobody was injured and added that the cause of the blaze was still being investigated.

But one neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'There was definitely a lot of lightning around last night. Some of the claps of thunder sounded like they were directly overhead.

'One of the firefighters told us they believed it was caused by a lightning strike. We don't see what else it could be because the property is empty so nobody would have been there.'

Manchester Airport said an electrical surge caused by thunderstorms had led to some delays today.

General duty manager Gary Brown said: 'It impacted on some lifts and baggage systems but most systems are now back up and running. We'll wait to see what happens this afternoon when we're expecting thunder.'

Patients on a hospital ward had to be moved when heavy rain brought down part of a ceiling.

Twenty-seven patients on the cardiology ward at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, were transferred after the incident at around 2am.Three ceiling panels came down in the hospital's catheter lab and cardiology ward after the roof sprang a leak.

The patients, who were all unharmed, were taken to other parts of the hospital.

A hospital spokesman said: 'At about 2am, in one of the severe heavy storms we had last night across the South West, there was a leak sprung in the roof of the hospital.

'Water got into the roof, causing three of the ceiling panels to come down due to the weight of the water.

'We had to transfer 27 patients from the cardiology ward to other parts of the hospital. They were not injured but they were inconvenienced and we apologise for that.'

The leak has now been plugged and it is hoped that the patients will soon be able to return to the ward, the spokesman added.

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service said an officer attended the hospital at 2.50am to liaise with medics but no further assistance was required.
