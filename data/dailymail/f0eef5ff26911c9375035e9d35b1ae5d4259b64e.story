FA Cup hero Craig Robinson gave Warrington Town supporters the perfect excuse to get plastered after shocking Exeter City at a bouncing Cantilever Park.

Robinson, brother of MK Dons manager Karl who was in the crowd to see his younger sibling play, got the decisive touch to David Mannix's seventh-minute corner and was instantly mobbed by jubilant team-mates.

The 32-year-old plasterer was just one of several heroes for the Evo-Stik northern section side who refused to accept a gap of four divisions and 100 places between them and League Two Exeter City

At the full-time whistle there was an old-fashioned joyous pitch invasion - and nobody cared.

This was an FA Cup first round clash straight out of central casting.

Warrington Town's ground on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal normally attract crowds of 200 to watch games against the likes of Bamber Bridge and Padiham.

To see it crammed with 2,400 fans was incredible. The day's torrential rain left the pitch wet and muddy - just like the television cameras like it.

The BBC had chosen to show this tie to mark the beginning of their new FA Cup contract. They were after an upset and even had a famous cup surname growling on the touchline – Shaun Reid, the Warrington manager whose brother Peter won the trophy in 1984 with Everton.

Reid's players – a fitness instructor, plasterer and pizza delivery driver among them – earn an average of £70-a-week out of football and were determined to enjoy their night in the spotlight.

This was the first time the club had reached this stage of the FA Cup in their 65-year history and it had already taken them seven matches to get here.

They set out the traps quickly and Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym had to rush from goal to save at the feet of Scott Metcalfe.

After seven minutes, they scored and the roof nearly came off the stadium's one tiny stand.

It was a goal in finest cup traditions. Former Liverpool trainee Mannix thumped a corner into a crowded six-yard box and centre-half Robinson got the decisive touch with his head. 

The scorer howled with sheer adrenaline and Reid let the Warrington staff and substitutes out of the dug-out for a mini-pitch invasion. 

An overcome Robinson said afterwards: 'I have been dreaming of this since I was a little kid. I was never lucky enough to play at the top level but to have my family here to see this is incredible. We just believed in ourselves as a team.

'We had to turn the car around in the morning because my nine-year-old daughter Darcy said she'd forgotten to bless me. So we ran back into the house, she got the medals out and the holy water, and she blessed me. And look what it's done!'

'Was it amazing? Was it incredible? Was it unbelievable? No, it was much more than that,' added Reid.

Exeter, who had taken a 470-mile round trip to the north-west, were stung and took 15 minutes to have their first meaningful chance. Graham Cummins was one-on-one with 'keeper Karl Wills who received a bang as he came out to save.

Of course, the league side knocked on the door for the rest of the evening.

David Noble came closest by hitting the crossbar torwards the end of the first half. The last 20 minutes saw Warrington penned back inside their own area.

Matt Grimes had an effort cleared off the line by the heroic Robinson. Warrington's players carried on despite fatigue and cramp.

Exeter's cup record is poor – they haven't won a tie since 2009/10. But nothing should detract from Warrington's mighty efforts. It is known as a rugby league town but not any more.
