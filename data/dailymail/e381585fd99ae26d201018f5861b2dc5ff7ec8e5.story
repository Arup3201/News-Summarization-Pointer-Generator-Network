Health experts have warned that the epidemic could leave unprotected children brain-damaged or dead

A measles outbreak is ‘spreading like bush fire’ in Wales despite urgent calls to ensure children have vital MMR protection.

Health experts have again warned the epidemic could leave unprotected children brain-damaged or dead.

They fear it could rival an outbreak which ravaged Dublin more than a decade ago, and killed three people.

The latest warning is fuelled by concerns that increasingly urgent public pleas for parents to act do not appear to be getting through.

The outbreak, centred on Swansea and the surrounding area, has seen the numbers infected rise from just over 200 on March 4 to 432 now.

By the end of last week, the disease had spread to children in 111 secondary and primary schools, nurseries and play groups.

Experts with Public Health Wales (PHW) expressed rising concern last week when the number of new cases rose.

Since then, a further 116 cases have been reported and the rate at which the disease is spreading shows no sign of slowing.

The majority of cases so far are in 
the Swansea area but an increasing number are being reported across the 
mid and west Wales regions.

Dr Marion Lyons, PHW director of health protection, warned: ‘Measles is now spreading like bush fire across areas of Wales.

‘Worryingly, there are still tens of thousands of susceptible children across Wales, yet our weekly monitoring of vaccination rates shows only a slight increase in numbers receiving MMR jabs.’

She added: ‘If the numbers of parents bringing their children for MMR jabs does not dramatically increase, measles will continue to spread and quickly reach levels last seen in the outbreak in Dublin in 1999/2000. In that outbreak over 1,200 children were infected and three died.

‘The risk to unvaccinated children in Wales is increasing as the disease spreads. You only need one or two people who haven't had the vaccination in a community to put at risk babies, toddlers and anyone else who is vulnerable, such as children with leukaemia who cannot have the vaccination and pregnant women who haven't been vaccinated.

Public Health Wales is urging people to get their children vaccinated

‘A simple and safe jab from your GP will protect your child's health, could save their life, and will help protect other children too.

'It is the only precaution you can take at this time, and I would urge parents to contact their GP today to get their children's MMR vaccinations up to date.

‘If you haven't thought about it, make an appointment with your GP for your child to get the MMR jab.

‘If you're worried about the jab, I would reassure you that the jab is safe and offers the only protection against measles. Get your child vaccinated.’

Public Health Wales is urging parents of all children aged between one and 18 in Wales who have not been fully vaccinated to contact their GP for advice and to arrange vaccination as soon as possible.
