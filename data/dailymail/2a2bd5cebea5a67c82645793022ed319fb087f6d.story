Even her greatest fans would acknowledge that Jo Brand is less than svelte – and the comedienne has long ridiculed her own physique and appetite for food in such books as her autobiography Look Back In Hunger and the TV series Jo Brand Through The Cakehole.

So the notion of the star who once dubbed herself ‘the Sea Monster’ managing to squeeze her way through a dog flap sounds a rather fanciful tale.

Would I Lie To You? Jo Brand appeared on the popular BBC One comedy show on Friday night

Yet this is exactly how she once broke into the home of an ex-boyfriend to steal all his underpants as revenge for him cheating on her.

Recalling that she was ‘about 18-ish’ at the time, Brand said: ‘I was going out with this bloke who was a millionaire.

‘We went to a party next door to his house. He ended up snogging someone else at this party – a woman with blonde hair, I can’t remember her name – so I was quite cross,’ adding that she ‘just wanted to do something’ to make her jealousy clear.

She joked that the dog flap was designed for a St Bernard then added: ‘He had a fat Scottie dog. I was thin at the time. I didn’t walk straight through – I wiggled through it.’

The 57-year-old said she searched the man’s bedroom for both washed and unwashed pants, as she wanted to do something ‘he would think was a bit weird’, while leaving him guessing over who was to blame.

Brand’s confession came during her appearance on the BBC One comedy quiz Would I Lie To You?, a panel game in which contestants have to decide whether the stories told by other celebrities are true or false.

Flap: At the time of the event Jo Brand's boyfriend 'had a fat Scottie dog. I was thin at the time'

She had to explain her link to a mystery guest called Andy. ‘He once helped me break into an ex-boyfriend’s house through the dog flap so I could steal all his pants,’ she declared, leaving it up to the opposing team to decide whether or not to believe her. ‘Andy’s part in it was that he helped push me through the garden side and he kept watch in case the neighbours noticed.

‘We went through the bedroom, got all his pants out of the drawer and all his pants out of the washing basket [and] threw them out into the garden. We went and chucked them in a bin and then went to the pub or something. A bit of me wanted to do something that he would think was a bit weird and possibly not know it was me...’

She did not name the boyfriend and said she never saw him again.

At the time, in the 1970s, she was living in Hastings, East Sussex, working in the civil service and studying part-time at nearby Bexhill College.

In interviews over the years she has described her teenage life as ‘the nightmare adolescent business’ and admitted she was ‘invited’ to leave home at 16 by her parents.

This followed an ultimatum from her civil engineer father Ron to stop seeing her first serious boyfriend. In a newspaper interview 18 years ago, Brand’s mother Joyce recalled the moment.

She said: ‘He was full of middle-class airs, with a very cavalier view of the world. She could have chosen almost anyone else and I could have coped better. He was 18, she was 16. The battleground was what time she could come home in the evening.

‘We waited up for her and he came in, too. It was after midnight.

‘When we said it was too late he was very disdainful. It made you feel you weren’t good enough. I was very angry.’

It is unclear whether the boyfriend later became the millionaire pants-snatch victim although due to his age it seems unlikely.

The family row soon passed and Mrs Brand told how she felt ‘proud and protective’ of her daughter. During Friday’s show, rival panellist Lee Mack led the questioning of Brand about her millionaire lover. He concluded: ‘So you don’t know to this day whether he ... well, he knows now.’

She replied: ‘Hopefully he’s dead so he doesn’t.’

Mack retorted: ‘As long as you’ve got over it then, Jo.’

He suspected she was telling the truth, insisting: ‘I’ve known Jo for some years and I can confirm she is bitter and twisted.’

However he bowed to the votes of his team-mates who were both convinced she was lying.

Brand, who lives in south London with her husband and two daughters, was unavailable for comment. Her manager said: ‘Jo is away for half-term.’
