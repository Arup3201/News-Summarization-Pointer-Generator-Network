Scrapped: A collection about Winston Churchill is to be taken down at Bletchley Park

The new chief executive of a museum dedicated to the Second World War code-breakers has sparked anger after announcing plans to remove Winston Churchill memorabilia. 

Iain Standen said having a collection about the wartime prime minister was 'not synonymous' with Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, and likened it to having 'Charles and Diana mugs in someone's house'. 

The trustees plan to take down the collection of pictures, posters, books, pamphlets and busts because they are not see as relevant.

Churchill once described the code-breakers who cracked the German's Enigma code as 'the geese that laid the golden eggs - but never cackled.'

According to the museum's website, the privately-owned collection has many rare and interesting pieces and fascinating stories that enthrall visiting pupils.

The displays chronologically illustrate events and episodes in Churchill’s life. 

A selection of Churchill’s broadcast speeches is also available for students to hear.

Examples of his literary works and reproductions of his paintings can be seen, and the displays span from his birth in 1874 through to his schooling, military career, political life, premiership, his likes and leisure pursuits, and finally his state funeral.

Students are also allowed to ring the bell of The Havengore, the launch used to carry Sir Winston’s coffin up the river Thames.

Historian Sarah Lambert, of Goldsmith's, University of London, said the exhibition must be protected and remain accessible to the public.

She told the Daily Express: 'This shows that history needs more funding so people are not put in the position of choosing one thing over another.'

Instead, the Churchill exhibition will be replaced with stories of the people who worked at the intelligence-gathering station near Milton Keynes during the war.

Mr Standen said the Churchill Collection was not museum-standard but just 'one man's obsession'. 

It is feared other displays such as the Pigeons At War exhibition could also be scrapped following a £7.5million restoration of the site.

The code-breakers wrote to Churchill in 1941 pleading for more resources.

The prime minister ordered immediate action to make sure they had everything needed to carry out their vital work.

But Mr Standen said: 'Bletchley Park is moving into a very exciting period in its development as we begin to undertake a partly publicly funded major restoration project which will start the process of turning the Park into a national, and in time we hope world class, heritage attraction.

'Part of this process involves working towards achieving national museum accreditation and as such we no longer have the space or are in the position to play host to a number of privately owned collections which are not focused on the World War Two Code-breaking story. 

'As a result we have reviewed the terms on which a number of such collections occupy space in the Park and have recently written to all outlining the specific conditions pertinent to each.

'Winston Churchill’s unerring support for Bletchley Park and the value of signals intelligence during World War Two, were clearly vital to the success of the operation.

'However, an individual’s collection of Churchill memorabilia does not tell this story.

'In short this is an interesting and exciting time for the Bletchley Park Trust, but with such developments as we are currently undergoing, there will inevitably be change.

'This may not please everyone, but the Bletchley Park Trustees are clear that what we are doing at the moment is necessary and important for the long-term future of the Park.'

During the war Bletchley Park housed the government's secret Code and Cypher School, which obtained signals intelligence by breaking high-level encrypted enemy communications.

It was also home to the Colossus machine, the first programmable electronic computer.

The Colossus and the Turing Bombe Machine, an an electromechanical device designed by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, were used to break codes created by the German Enigma encryption and decryption machine, which is also on display at Bletchley Park.

The importance of the code-breaking operations at Bletchley Park cannot be underestimated.

They produced vital intelligence that played a huge part in swinging the war in the Allies’ favour.

By 1944 British and American commanders knew the location of 58 out of 60 German divisions across the Western Front.

In addition, a great deal of information was decrypted about General Erwin Rommel’s Nazi forces in North Africa.

The German commander enjoyed a great deal of success against the British but with the help of intelligence from the code-breakers General Bernard Montgomery's British forces were able to drive him back in 1942.

Discussions with the owners of all the other private collections on the Bletchley Park site are ongoing.
