Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, was killed by a NATO drone

A former Guantánamo Bay detainee who recently pledged allegiance to ISIS has been killed in Afghanistan.

Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, was killed by a NATO drone strike along with his son-in-law and six others as they drove through Kajaki district in the volatile southern province of Helmand, Afghan officials said. 

Rauf, an ex-Taliban commander, declared allegiance to Isis in January, and claimed to be recruiting fighters on behalf of the group which holds large swaths of Syria and Iraq.

He was branded by the Washington Post last month as 'the shadowy figure recruiting for the Islamic State in Afghanistan.'

A Pakistani militant commander said Rauf had been an important liaison between various factions which have broken away from the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban movements in recent months. 

His defection had caused deadly infighting and raised fears the movement was gaining footholds in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

A statement from Resolute Support, the new name for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said 'coalition forces conducted a precision strike in Helmand province today, resulting in the death of eight individuals threatening the force'. 

Mohammad Jan Rasulyar, the deputy governor of Helmand, said the strike hit the militants' vehicle at around 10am.

Rauf was detained by the US in 2001 and spent six years in Guantánamo Bay, in Cuba (pictured) 

Rauf, also known as Abdul Rauf Aliza, had a long history of insurgency. 

He was detained by the US in 2001 and spent six years in Guantánamo, where he claimed he was nothing more than a bread delivery man for the Taliban.

According to a document released by WikiLeaks, American interrogators suspected at the time Rauf had more influence than he claimed. 

But he was released to Afghanistan for further detention in 2007.  

In Kabul, he managed to escape from house arrest and in 2011 acted as the Taliban's shadow governor in Uruzgan province

Rauf then formed a splinter group of fighters after falling out with the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, and recently clashed with a Taliban unit in Helmand's Sangin district.

Locals say Rauf's men, numbering around 300, were often in conflict with Taliban officials in Helmand. 

There have been fears of ISIS making inroads in Afghanistan since US-led NATO forces ended their combat mission in late December, after 13 years of fighting.
