Ashley opens up about how life in the Pussycat Dolls wasn't always fair

Unsurprisingly, perhaps, you get more sense from a member of a girl band when she's no longer a member of that band and has reached the grand old age of 32.

There's no doubt Ashley Roberts could still rock the skimpy little outfits she used to wear in her days with the Pussycat Dolls - the band, fronted by X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, whose risqu√© outfits and dance moves left very little to the imagination.

But ask her about the wider implications of spending much of your twenties parading around in your pants (even if it is in the name of empowerment) and she gives a considered reply.

'Let's face it, we were a product,' she says. 'It wasn't a message we disagreed with - the band had been built on that sexy image, so running around in fishnets and undies was part of it - but it was quite weird. In your twenties you're trying to figure out who you are; making mistakes, wanting to be sexy, growing up as a woman.'

All of which, she adds, is difficult when you're living in a bubble. 'One of the weirdest things for me, when The Dolls split four years ago, was having to adapt to the real world. Actually going to the supermarket to get my own groceries was a revelation. I'd never had to fill the fridge before, do my laundry, put petrol in my car. It was scary - but there was a kind of joy about it too.'

When The Pussycat Dolls split it was generally assumed Nicole Scherzinger - always the focus, to the point where it reportedly led to feuding within the band - would go on to greater things.

So it happened. As well as forging a solo career, she ended up on the X Factor panel, immediately acquiring a wider, more mainstream, fanbase.

This has been the case too, to a lesser degree, with Ashley, who in 2012 was runner-up on I'm A Celebrity. The high-risk move (it involved eating camel's unmentionables) seems to have worked.

She's since segued, via the judging panel of Dancing On Ice, into presenting work, most notably alongside Ant and Dec on Saturday Night Takeaway.

So, is she having a fling with Declan Donnelly, as has been reported?

'No,' she says. 'That was the media having fun. I don't have a boyfriend. I never wanted to get married until quite recently, but now the first of the Dolls has settled down (Kimberly Wyatt got married in February) I'm thinking more about it. I just need to find the right guy. I love hanging out with Ant and Dec because they're such fun, but there's no romance.'

Later this summer, Ashley brings out her first album since leaving the Dolls, marking a return to the singing career she embarked on as a toddler in Phoenix, Arizona.

Her father Pat was a drummer who played for The Mamas And The Papas, and she was on a stage almost as soon as she could walk. She jokes now that's why the Dolls' outfits never seemed a big deal to her ('I spent my whole childhood in leotards, tutus, sports bras; I was showing my midriff from the age of three').

Yet the speed with which fame did arrive - when she was a 22-year-old dancer - was phenomenal.

The Pussycat Dolls, launched as a burlesque-style act, were catapulted to global fame almost overnight with the song Don't Cha. 'It was like a rocket,' she recalls.

'All of a sudden there were fans waiting outside the hotel room and we were getting flown across the world.' In the melee, she admits now, she didn't stop to consider the small print.

'People think we must have made enough money never to have to worry again, but we didn't. I'm not complaining - I got a home out of it - but did we make as much as we should have? Probably not. We knew there were certain amounts coming in that we weren't necessarily getting. At the beginning you don't pay attention to that - we were all so young and excited - but after seven years of touring, when you've made all these sacrifices and are burnt out, it matters.'

It wasn't just, she says, that the record company was getting more money than she feels was fair, but that other members of the band - well, Nicole, the band's main songwriter - was too.

'It wasn't equally divided,' she says. 'It was partly because of the writing, partly... well, it just wasn't. And that was fine at the start, but not towards the end. Now, you look at bands like U2 and think, "Why are they still together?" The answer is they split everything equally.'

She won't be drawn on the cattiness that seemed to surround the split, but stories have abounded of how only Nicole was allowed to speak in press interviews, and how she always got what she wanted.

Is it true she didn't even travel with the others? 'Well, she did on flights,' she says. 'But on the tour bus, no. She had a separate bus.'

Why? 'I don't know. To write, maybe. You'd have to ask her. Look, people have tried to say there was and is a feud, but it wasn't like that. We were five girls in a band. With that, you get situations - time of the month, relationships, egos, insecurities. We were five girls put together on a crazy rollercoaster ride. It was a family - a dysfunctional family, but still a family. I went through everything, good and bad, with those girls.'

She says she's still in touch with Nicole, but while the other Dolls were at Kimberly's wedding, Nicole wasn't. 'She was invited,' says Ashley. 'But she couldn't come.'

Immediately after leaving the Dolls, Ashley engaged a life coach, 'to help me work out who I was'. You can see why.

As well as the rollercoaster of her professional life, she had a turbulent family life to deal with. When she was 14 her parents divorced.

Then when her father's showbiz career dried up, he turned to selling cars but was declared bankrupt in 2005 and later accused of defrauding investors. Her younger brother Jayce, 27, has schizophrenia and has convictions for violence, indecent exposure, drugs and theft.

For years she didn't mention him at all in interviews. Now she says his issues 'are finally being dealt with. It's heavy, but he's in a home now. He has the help he needs. When I'm back in Phoenix I visit him, hug him and tell him I love him more than anything. It's hard. You feel helpless. It breaks my heart.'

She still sees her life coach regularly, and says she wishes she'd worked things out earlier.

'Growing up, you run to work or to music, or to your escape - whatever it is - and don't necessarily deal with the emotions underlying it all, especially in the US because we have a pill for everything. Everyone should have a life coach. We learn history, maths and science at school, but we don't have the tools to understand emotions; to release them and not hold on to anger. My life coach is my angel.'

Ashley's new single Clockwork is out on 25 May.
