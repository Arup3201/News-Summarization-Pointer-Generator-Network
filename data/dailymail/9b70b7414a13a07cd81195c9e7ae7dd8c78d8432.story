She's famous for her perfectly groomed mane but even the Duchess of Cambridge's long locks couldn't withstand the wind that sprung up during the Remembrance Day parade.

Faced with a chilly breeze, the Duchess repeatedly twirled her locks back into shape as she watched veterans process past the Cenotaph alongside the Countess of Wessex.

Despite the havoc created by the gale, the Duchess cut an elegant figure in a sombre black textured coat and a James Lock & Co beret.

Poppies: Both the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Cambridge wore patriotic floral brooches

Watching her husband lay a wreath of 
poppies at the memorial, she appeared lost in thought as she 
stood, smiling at the crowds below, with the Countess of Wessex.

Both
 royals sported poppies; combined with a delicate diamond brooch in the 
Duchess' case, while the Countess of Wessex carried a black Lulu 
Guinness clutch bag emblazoned with the flowers.

The Duchess also showed off her thrifty side, appearing in a James Lock & Co beret that she first wore during the St Patrick's Day Parade in March.

Down in the street, the Queen, in an all-black ensemble and carrying one of her trademark Launer leather bags, was flanked by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Harry as she arrived to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph.

Also watching the parade of 
servicemen was the Prime Minister and his wife Samantha
who was chic in a demure knee-length dress, a neat 
pair of LK Bennett black patent court shoes and a stylish pillbox hat.

Other political wives remembering the fallen at the Cenotaph included Justine Milliband, Norma Major and Cherie Blair.

Like
 Samantha Cameron, Mrs Milliband plumped for a pillbox hat and 
wrapped up warm in a tailored black coat and smart leather 
gloves.

But despite their efforts, all eyes were on 
the veterans who stood silently as the bell of Big Ben chimed 11, 
ushering in a respectful two minutes silence.

Many
 of those at the parade and remembrance service had also appeared at the
 Festival of Remembrance held at the Royal Albert Hall the previous 
night.

Accompanying the 
Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the three main party leaders, was the 
Countess of Wessex who, while sombre during the Remembrance Sunday 
parade, was moved to tears by a small girl reunited with her serviceman 
father on stage.

Megan 
Adams, 10, from Stirling in Scotland, appeared on stage to perform with 
the Poppy Girls before being surprised by the unexpected appearance of 
her father Lieutenant Commander Billy Adams, who had been serving in a 
Navy patrol off the Seychelles.

Tribute: Samantha Cameron and Justine Milliband, both in pillbox hats, joined their husbands at the Cenotaph
