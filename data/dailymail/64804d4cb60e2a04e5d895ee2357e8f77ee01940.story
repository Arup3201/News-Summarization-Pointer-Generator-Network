Sales records were smashed yesterday as more than £5.4billion was spent on the first two days of the winter sales.

Despite some retailers starting their sales online on Christmas Day, and in some cases Christmas Eve, one in four of all UK adults still hit the high street in person.

As John Lewis and M&S launched their in-store sales yesterday, experts said this week’s predicted £10.4billion-plus spend will be 2012’s most lucrative for retailers.

International shoppers far outnumbered Britons at many luxury department stores yesterday. The Bicester Village outlet is a big hit with overseas shoppers

Foreign customers – in particular 
from Asia, the Middle East and Nigeria – have helped drive sales with 
the large numbers of Chinese snapping up luxury goods dubbed the ‘Peking
pound’ effect.

Retail analysts said yesterday’s 
trade was even busier than Boxing Day as some chains had given their 
staff Wednesday off and many would-be shoppers had stayed at home with 
their families.

Adding yesterday’s £2.8billion to 
Boxing Day’s £2.1billion store spend and £472.5million online gives a 
two-day spend of £5.4billion – which the Centre for Retail Research 
declared an all-time record, beating the £5billion on the same two days 
last year.

It also eclipsed last weekend, when the British Retail Consortium said a weekend record of £4.5billion was spent.

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director 
of the Centre for Retail Research, said: ‘December 27 was manic, bigger 
than Boxing Day and the most popular day at the sales.

The sales have started as a great 
success, beating last year’s spending over the first two days – and 
there is significant spending ahead.

‘The success of the sales is due to 
spending being shifted from pre-Christmas to post-Christmas, and 
shoppers being very price conscious – with the reduction in prices 
loosening purse strings.’ 
Shopper numbers were down throughout December, although online sales were strong, but soared by 21.6 per cent on Boxing Day.

The Centre for Retail Research said 
13million shoppers spent £2.4billion on bargains yesterday with a 
further £400million expected to have been spent online.

It is a welcome fillip to the retail sector, which started slashing prices earlier this year in a bid to generate sales. 

High shopper numbers were reported at
major shopping centres including Bluewater in Kent, the Trafford Centre
in Manchester, Birmingham’s Bullring and the MetroCentre in Gateshead.

John Lewis had already started its 
online sale on Christmas Eve but that did not deter shoppers from going 
to the start of their in-store sale yesterday.

Hundreds queued outside the largest 
John Lewis store in the West Midlands, in Solihull, as it opened its 
doors an hour early at 8.30am.

Operations manager Ben Service said: 
‘Audio and television and menswear were particularly busy first. Bed 
linen and towels and sheets were very popular too.’ 

Elsewhere, shopping centres reported 
brisk business. Gordon McKinnon, director of operations at the Trafford 
Centre, said there was evidence foreign visitors had driven many sales.

He said: ‘We know that because we operate a tax free shopping scheme and there’s been a big growth in people using the scheme.’ 

Boxing Day was the biggest online 
shopping day in British retail history, according to figures released by
global information services company Experian. 

Bargain hunters made 113million visits to online retail sites as they surfed the sales from the comfort of their own home. 

The figure eclipsed new records  of 84million visits on Christmas Eve and 107million visits on  Christmas Day.
