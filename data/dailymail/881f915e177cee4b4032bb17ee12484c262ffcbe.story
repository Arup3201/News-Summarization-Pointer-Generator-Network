Tragic: Air Force veteran Ronald Westbrook was shot on Wednesday morning

The Georgia man who shot dead a 72-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer may not be charged if he pleads self defense under the controversial 'Zimmerman law'.

The provision, which states that a person has 'no duty to retreat' when faced by an assailant, came under global scrutiny this year after Miami community watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot dead teenager Trayvon Martin and walked free after claiming he had the right to stand his ground.

The Georgia version of the law could be used in the case of Joe Hendrix, 34, who shot at Air Force veteran Ronald Westbrook, 72, after the elderly dementia sufferer tried to enter his home at 4am.

Mr Westbrook was said to have been wandering around in the cold for hours with his two dogs.

He was stopped by a police officer who asked him why he was out at 2am, two hours before the shooting.

Mr Westbrook is said to have told the officer he was picking up his mail.

But after the officer left, the unwell veteran continued to walk around.

Eventually he headed towards the home of Mr Hendrix, who had only moved into the area days earlier.

After the shooting which followed, one of Mr Westbrook's dogs laid down on its owners body and had to be pulled away by officers who arrived at the scene.

In the southeastern state, the law reserves the right for a member of the public to take pre-emptive action if they feel their life is threatened.

Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson told Fox News he believed Mr Hendrix did feel threatened and that the state's Stand Your Ground law may apply.

Under the law, a person is permitted to use force if they feel they are under physical threat. They do not have to retreat, even if backing down is a possibility.

Confused: Ronald Westbrook, who had Alzheimer's, may have walked to the Georgia house because the porch light was on

Mr Westbrook, who was married and had
three children, knocked on the door of the rented house Mr Hendrix and 
his fiancee had moved to only two weeks ago.

'He
had traveled about 2.6 miles from his home to the shooting location by 
foot with a wind chill of about 20 degrees, very loosely clothed with 
his two dogs,' Sheriff Wilson told WRCB TV.

As
Mr Hendrix called out commands Mr Westbrook, who talked slowly, 
continued to walk towards him, The Times Free Press reported.

When he failed to get a response, Mr Hendrix then fired his handgun four times, killing Mr Westbrook.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, tomorrow, and the circuit district attorney could bring charges after reviewing the evidence.

'Mr Hendrix is clearly saddened and 
heartbroken. Mr Hendrix has to live with his 
actions for the rest of his life,' Sheriff Wilson said.

He added: 'In my personal opinion, I believe that 
he should have stayed inside the house. Did he violate any 
laws by exiting the house? No.'

Mr Westbrook, who was wearing a straw hat and light jacket when he was shot, had been stopped by police a few hours before after being spotted standing at a mailbox close to where he used to live.

The Air Force veteran had told the deputy who stopped that he was just getting his mail.

Sheriff Wilson said that Mr Hendrix had been very cooperative with the investigation.

The Sheriff said he believed Mr Westbrook had approached that particular house because the porch light was on, according to the Chattanooga Times.

Ronald Westbrook, a 72-year-old with advanced Alzheimer's, was shot dead by a homeowner after he spent four hours wandering around in the dark and banged on the man' door in rural Walker County, Georgia

Sheriff Wilson told Chattanooga Times that he knew Mr Westbrook, who attended the same church as him.

‘Just a fine man, fine family,’ Sheriff Wilson said. ‘I really hate it for his wife and his children.’

Mr Westbrook's family hadn't realized that he had wandered off until around the time the shooting occurred.

‘You
can't watch them 24/7,’ Sheriff Wilson said of people suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease, which he said got progressively worse for Mr Westbrook
after dementia was diagnosed two years ago.
