With less than three months to go before the birth of her first baby, the Duchess of Cambridge is clearly in the mood for a little nesting.

And who better to take on a shopping trip to furnish her future prince or princess’s new nursery at Kensington Palace than her mother, Carole Middleton.

The pair were spotted in upmarket South Kensington together, browsing some of the capital’s most exclusive baby stores after enjoying a spot of lunch together at the Zefi Mediterranean restaurant where they were seen by fellow diners sipping healthy fruit juices.

The Duchess of Cambridge was spotted with her mother Carole Middleton during a shopping trip in South Kensington, where they bought a large white wicker Moses basket for the imminent arrival of the royal baby

The Duchess and her mother were seen dining in a nearby Mediterranean restaurant before their visit to a children's clothing and furniture store

Carole carried the Moses basket out of Blue Almonds, where prices go up to £295 for an off the shelf model

First on their list was Blue Almonds, which boasts that it creates ‘magical rooms for children’ - perfect for the third in line to the throne.

Dressed in identical dark blue skinny jeans and knee-high black boots, mother and daughter spent up to an hour browsing the Moses baskets on sale.

Priced up to £295 for an off the shelf model, they are certainly out of reach price-wise for many new mothers-to-be.

Some bespoke versions at the store can cost up to £1,000 and be customised with frilled fitted sheets and sun shades.

Kate, 31, who was wearing a loose blue maternity top with a pretty white lace collar, and her mother finally settled on a large white wicker version and walked out into the street together, clearly discussing their purchase.

They were then whisked off by a waiting car driven by one of Kate’s bodyguards, presumably back to Kensington Palace where Kate is overseeing the renovation of her new apartment.

A bodyguard was waiting to drive the Duchess and her mother away, presumably to Kensington Palace where Kate is overseeing the refurbishment of her future family home, Apartment 1A

The Duchess and her mother both wore dark blue skinny jeans with knee-high black boots for the shopping trip

As revealed by the Mail, work on Apartment 1A, once the home of the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, will not be finished until at least September or October this year, well after the birth of her baby.

Kate and her husband, Prince William, are currently living in a small two-up, two-down cottage in the grounds, which is less than ideal to bring a royal heir home to.

As a result, say sources, Kate has decided to eschew the help of a maternity nurse and spend the first six weeks after her child’s birth living with her parents at their new £4.8million Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

She has told friends that she cannot think of anyone better suited to helping her in those first difficult few weeks than her mother, who has brought up three children of her own.

‘It’s where I feel safest,’ she has said.

Carole is said to be nervous but thrilled at the prospect of becoming a grandmother for the first time

Carole, for her part, is said to be nervous but thrilled at the prospect of becoming a grandmother for the first time - to a future king or queen at that.

Although Izabela Minkiewicz, the owner of Blue Almonds, has declined to comment on the Duchess’s purchases, she confirmed that she was ‘honoured’ to have received a visit from her.

‘We spend a great deal of time making sure that we get to know the client, their particular taste and demands,’ she said.

Prince Harry was spotted carrying a teddy bear for his future niece or nephew yesterday as he arrived home to Kensington Palace. He had promised a wellwisher in Nottingham this week that he would pass on the gift

The shopping trip came at a busy time for the Duchess, who yesterday gave her first public video message appealing for support for Children's Hospice Week 

Kate also joined her husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry at the opening of the Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden where they had a go at wand work on the set of the Harry Potter films

The Duchess carried out a charity engagement at the National Portrait Gallery on Wednesday and prompted a rush on Topshop's website when she wore their spotted dress, right, to the Warner Brothers Studios on Friday

The following day Kate was seen back out shopping for baby goods again at the Peter Jones department store in Chelsea, where she spent several hours mulling over buggies and a car seat.

The Duchess has revealed that her baby is due in mid-July and that she will be going on maternity leave around a month earlier but insists, contrary to speculation, that she and William have chosen not to discover the sex of their first child.
