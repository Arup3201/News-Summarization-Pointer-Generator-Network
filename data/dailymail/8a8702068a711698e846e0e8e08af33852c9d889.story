Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has signed for West Bromwich Albion on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

The 30-year-old completed his move late on Monday night after an extension was granted for the deal to be completed beyond the 11pm deadline. 

Fletcher's initial deal is for two and a half years with the option of a further 12 months. 

Fletcher was poised to sign for West Ham on Saturday but the deal fell through after Sam Allardyce's side attempted to make the deal a loan instead of permanent deal.

Fletcher told West Brom's official website: 'It feels great. This is a fantastic new challenge for me in my career.

'I've spent my career at Manchester United and it's all I've ever known.

'But I felt it was the right time to move and I'm not sentimental about doing that - I have great memories obviously, but I'm now a West Bromwich Albion player and I cannot wait to get going.

'Everyone involved in making the deal happen has been fantastic. And a big reason I'm here is because of the head coach.

'He has impressed me from the first minute. When someone shows how much they want you it's a great feeling.'

United had already agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer and manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement.

'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.'

Fletcher was due to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal at West Ham worth around £60,000 a week.

Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season.

Fletcher will not be joined at West Brom by Carlton Cole after his proposed deadline day move fell through.
