The Milwaukee Bucks paid a visit to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday afternoon ahead of their game against the New York Knicks at the O2 Arena on Thursday.

Bucks starts including Brandon Knight and Giannis Antetokounmpo got their hands on the Champions League trophy as they took a tour around Chelsea's home ground.

Their head coach Jason Kidd made his third trip to London in as many years having played for the Knicks against the Detroit Pistons in 2013 before returning 12 months later to coach the Brooklyn Nets to victory against the Atlanta Hawks.

After landing in England, Kidd said: 'We're delighted to be here. I've been to London for the last two games here and it is always a great experience. There is so much to see and do, it's a fantastic city.

'I really like The O2 and I'm looking forward to going back there, I have some fond memories from the last two years. There is always a good atmosphere in that building. We've come here to get the win though and that has to be our focus.'

Greek star Antetokounmpo added: 'I'm very excited to be in London. This is the first time I've travelled outside of the US with my team and it's something I've been really looking forward to.

'I've spoken with Brandon (Knight), who came here before (2013 with the Pistons), and he told me all about London. I just can't wait to explore the city and to play at The O2.'
