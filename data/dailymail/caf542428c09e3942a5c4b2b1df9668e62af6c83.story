Brooke Mueller has accused Denise Richards of 'trying to turn' her sons against her.

The 36-year-old reportedly submitted documents with a Los Angeles court claiming her son Bob, four, had 'kicked and slapped' her during his first overnight visit with her since her rehab stay.

'In the filing, Brooke said Bob told her
that he "hated her." Brooke said she believes that Denise told Bob to 
say that as part of an ongoing campaign to turn the boys against her,' a
source told RadarOnline.

During the supervised visit, Bob also tried to bite his twin brother Max and wouldn't look his mother in the eye, said the source.

'Brooke asked the boys if anyone told them to misbehave and she didn’t get a response. Brooke thinks the boys are being bribed with toys and candy by Denise,' said the source.

Meanwhile, another source told the website: 
'There’s no evidence that Denise has done anything that Brooke has 
alleged. It’s quite the opposite… Denise has never spoken ill of Brooke 
in the presence of the boys, ever. The appropriate forum for her to 
address her concerns was via a letter to child protective services.'

Denise, 42, was granted temporary custody of Bob and Max after Brooke was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year.

But Denise wrote a
letter to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family 
Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the 
boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs according to TMZ.

The James Bond actress reportedly 
blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she 
revealed they have lashed out at her and Charlie's daughters, Sam, nine,
and Lola, eight, as well as her adopted child Eloise, two.

Feud: Charlie and Brooke's relationship has deteriorated so badly that she recently sought a restraining order against him while he hit out calling her a 'whore'

The
website says Denise claims her daughters have been 'strangled, kicked 
in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face 
and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’.

Meanwhile, photographs have emerged of Bob with severe bruising to his head.

The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of Brooke or his grandmother Moira Fiore.

In one zoomed-in image,
reportedly taken by Denise, Bob returned from a weekend with Brooke and Moira on July 26, with a noticeable raw skin sore near the red 
mark.

The images have now been presented to the LA Department of Children and Family Services by Sheen's legal team.

News of Denise’s letter comes just 
after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed
attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. 

He
wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you 
are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me
and my boys (sic)’

He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August.

He
captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: 
'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home 
Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c'
