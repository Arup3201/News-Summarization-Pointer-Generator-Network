Amazon has drastically dropped the price of the Fire phone in the US from $199 to just 99 cents, when taken on a two-year AT&T contract

Compared to rivals Apple and Samsung, Amazon is a newbie in the smartphone market and it is making bold moves to try and attract customers.

Amazon has drastically dropped the price of the device in the US from $199 to just 99 cents, when taken on a two-year contract.

It has also dropped the price of an unlocked handset from $649 to $449. 

This has been seen as a radical move, and is believed to have been prompted by the poor sales of the device in the US.

In August, Chitika advertising network revealed that the Amazon's Fire phone was achieving just 0.02 per cent of web share.

The move comes ahead of the Fire phone launching in the UK at the end of this month, and Apple launching its iPhone 6 handset tonight.

The two-year contract is available exclusively on an AT&T contract, and comes with a year’s Amazon Prime membership.

This membership includes Prime Instant Video, Kindle Owners’ Lending Library and unlimited one-day shipping, for free.

The announcement comes less than a week after the Seattle-based firm unveiled plans to bring its TV streaming box, Fire TV, to the UK for the first time as well.

Amazon Fire comes with a unique screen that uses four cameras built into the front of the phone that track head movement.

These cameras and movement sensors position images on the screen to create a 3D, holographic effect.

Amazon calls it Dynamic Perspective and claim it is one of the reasons the Fire Phone can challenge rivals such as the iPhone.

This 4.7-inch screen has a 720 x 1280 resolution, and a 315 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), compared to the iPhone 5S' 640 x 1136 resolution, and 326 PPI.

The Amazon Fire phone also has a 13MP rear-facing camera, a 2.1 front-facing sensor, plus a minimum of 32GB of storage.

The new phone also aims to beat its rivals by taking full advantage of Amazon’s popular, existing services, with its Firefly feature.

This app lets users scan food, DVDs, music and games, and instantly link to the product on Amazon.

The technology giant has also opened up this software to other app developers, and as a result relevant results will appear from apps such as MyFitnessPal - when users scan food - telling them the number of calories in a product.

Apps, such as StubHub have also already been integrated into the feature, meaning that when users scan a CD, not only will Amazon links appear, but also live tour dates.

Other features include X-Ray, that helps users explore books, including characters, ideas and background, by tapping the screen.

The Amazon Fire phone (pictured) is available to pre-order in the UK. It goes on sale on 30 September

The 4.7-inch Fire phone was introduced by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos in the US earlier this year.

It will go on sale in the UK from 30 September.

Pre-orders for the device are now available exclusively from Amazon and O2.

The phone will be sold on O2's Refresh tariffs.

Customers who pay £33 per month, for example, get the 32GB Amazon Fire Phone with no upfront payment and unlimited minutes, texts and 2GB of 4G data per month.

After they’ve covered the cost of the phone through these monthly payments, their monthly tariff will drop to £18 per month.

It will be made available on Pay-As-You-Go at launch, with prices being announced on the day.

The phone comes with a year’s Amazon Prime membership.

This membership includes Prime Instant Video, Kindle Owners’ Lending Library and unlimited one-day shipping, for free.

The device also has a 13MP rear-facing camera, a 2.1 front-facing sensor, plus a minimum of 32GB of storage.

Second Screen lets users beam TV shows and movies from a Fire phone to a Fire TV, PlayStation or any other Miracast-enabled device.

And the device additionally comes with free unlimited cloud storage of photos taken with Fire, automatically backed-up wirelessly across Amazon devices and Cloud Drive apps

The Fire Phone will face stiff competition, including Samsung's latest Galaxy Note Edge, unveiled at the IFA technology show in Berlin last week, and the new iPhone 6 expected to be announced tonight.
