He may have turned his back on a multimillionaire lifestyle and rock immortality but Pink Floyd's first singer said he had 'no regrets' about quitting the band.

Chris Dennis was playing with Roger Waters and Nick Mason in the early 1960s when the group performed their first gigs as Pink Floyd.

Mr Dennis, 74, left to take up a RAF posting in Bahrain just a year after he joined because he thought the band was not 'going anywhere'.

He then went on to set up his own studio while Pink Floyd became one of the biggest bands of the twentieth century, recorded classics such as Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here and sell 250 million albums worldwide.

But far from being bitter about his decision, Mr Dennis said he has always been proud of their success.

The grandfather of eight, who lives with his wife Pam in Llangefni, Anglesey, North Wales, said: 'I’ve
no regrets. I helped start the biggest rock band in the world and it 
enabled me to hang out with the likes of Jimi Hendrix - that’s enough 
for me.'

By the time Mr Dennis had returned to the UK from Bahrain, 
Pink Floyd’s first album Piper At The Gates Of Dawn had been released.

He said: 'When I first picked up 
Floyd’s first record in a store, I felt nothing but proud of them. I was
so pleased and happy that they had made it.'

He added: 'To be honest, I didn’t 
even like the sort of music Pink Floyd were playing at the time - so 
they probably wouldn’t have had the success they’ve had if I had 
continued to play in the band.

'I’m not bitter or jealous
at all of the success of the other guys - that doesn’t even come into 
it. The band was a bit of fun back then and I was a bit of a joker.

'My only regret was I only wish I’d 
taken more photographs of the guys then. I was never really a fan of 
their music, but the stuff they do now is just wonderful.'

Mr
Dennis recorded with the band during their first studio session and was
with them when Syd Barrett came up with the name Pink Floyd.

He joined the group in 1963 after 
meeting founding member guitarist Bob Klose as a technician with the RAF
posted to Uxbridge, London.

A year later he recorded with the band alongside Roger Waters, Richard Wright, drummer Nick Mason and Barrett.

He said: 'I was in a music shop in 
Soho looking for a guitar and I saw Bob and he introduced me to Roger 
Waters.

'They explained they were looking for a singer for their band 
and said: "We’ll put you in". Of course I said yes.

'I had been in bands since I was a 
16-year-old lad, playing in various skiffle bands and I knew Bob from 
the gig circuits in Cambridge when I was posted there. He used to come 
round and jam with my band.'

Mr Dennis rehearsed regularly with the band before becoming the frontman for their first set of gigs.

He said: 'We would rehearse in the 
house they shared. We at that time we didn’t even have a name - and 
believe me, it was a dispute.

'We were rehearsing blues songs for 
our first gig at a private party in Surrey. It was mostly covers we did 
back then, we’d practice at the house two or three times a week.

'On the night of the gig, Syd ran 
through and said, "I’ve got a name, it’s going to be called Pink Floyd." Well, I didn’t like it at the time because it didn’t make sense.'

He left a year later when he was 
posted to Bahrain but said he was going to leave anyway because he did 
not like Pink Floyd's music.

He said: ‘I was on the edge of 
leaving the band anyway - Roger and I had a difference of opinion with 
it came to music.

'He liked the traditional blues music 
like Muddy Waters, where I was more into the more up-beat blues you 
could dance too - like the Stones and Chuck Berry.

'He wouldn’t like if we didn’t play it exactly right - I was getting a bit fed up and I didn’t think it was going anywhere.

'I was planning on leaving anyway because
I wasn’t into the music they were playing - I wanted to play blues music.

'And when I came back they never asked
me back in the band. They had a completely different sound anyway, they
had changed their style.

'I’d finished with it. The band was a six month 
blip in my life. It was good but I had moved on from it.'

Mr Dennis pursued a career in music after leaving the RAF in 1973.

He set up his own studio in Cambridge and laid down tracks for the likes of Dave Berry, The Glitter Band's Tony Leonard and members of Shakin Stevens.

He has also built up a collection of 20 guitars - three of which he recently put up for auction.

The Sunburst Stratocaster and Fender Squire Stagemaster sold for almost £500 but a Gretch Eddie Cochrane worth £600 failed to sell.

Mr Dennis has continued to play but admits he is more likely to play to a group of friend's at a party than thousands of people in an arena.

He said: 'I speak to Nick two or three times a year
and maybe Roger once a year - but I have to say they do move in 
different circles to me now.'
