England capitulated in spectacular fashion after lunch to fall to a humiliating 95-run defeat at Lord’s that leaves captain Alastair Cook’s future in grave doubt.

Cook’s team lost six wickets for 50 runs either side of lunch to be bowled out for 223 in one of the most embarrassing displays of his increasingly disastrous spell in charge. England have now lost seven of their last 10 Tests and have not won in that period. It is their worst run in 21 years.

The England captain, whose batting form has also collapsed, was badly let down by his batsmen again after lunch on day five of the second Investec Test following a promising morning session which Moeen Ali and Joe Root so nearly negotiated safely.

And again: Ben Stokes looks to the heavens as the ball goes up into the air and is caught by Cheteshwar Pujara

And another one: Joe Root plays a reckless pull shot, again off Sharma, and is caught by Stuart Binny

But Ali’s dismissal one ball before 
the break started a dramatic collapse which saw one batsman after 
another succumb to Ishant Sharma’s bouncer barrage.

Matt
 Prior, who may have played his last Test for England, was the first to 
fall when he hooked Sharma to deep square leg where Murali Vijay took 
the catch to reduce the hosts to 198 for six, chasing 319.

Ben
 Stokes completed a miserable Test with the bat moments later when he 
also hooked Sharma into the deep to record a pair and leave England on 
the brink.

Joe Root had 
batted superbly to reach 66 but with his partners committing the 
equivalent of cricketing suicide up the other end, the Yorkshireman also
 fell for Sharma’s sucker punch by hooking to Stuart Binny at backward 
square leg, handing the Indian fast bowler his seventh wicket.

Jimmy
 Anderson was the last man out when he was run out cheaply in 
embarrassing fashion that summed up England’s woeful recent 
performances.
