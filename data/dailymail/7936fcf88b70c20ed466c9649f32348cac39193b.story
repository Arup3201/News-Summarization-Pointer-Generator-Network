A teenage college student who has been charged with murdering all three members of his family has been described as an 'evil person' by the district attorney.

Alan Hruby, 19, of Norman, Oklahoma, admitted to shooting his father, John Hruby, mother, Katherine 'Tinker' Hruby and younger sister Katherine, on Thursday night.

Now, Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks is talking about what a frightening young man Alan is, and how little he seemed to care about what he did.

Killer: Alan Hruby (center, with two friends) is being described as an 'evil person' by the district attorney after murdering his entire family

Bad seed: The college freshman (seen above at his prom) planned the killings according to the district attorney

No remorse: It is also said the young man, seen just days before the killing at University of Oklahoma, cried 'crocodile tears' when informed his family was dead

'It was completely planned out,' Hicks said after filing the murder case. 

'This kid is an evil person.' 

What's more, someone who saw Alan in Dallas, where he got a room at The Ritz-Carlton after killing his family while his school, University of Oklahoma, took on University of Texas in a football game nearby, said he acted completely normal.

'I did not travel with him. I just met him in Dallas. He was not acting weird at all,' Andrew P. Bormann, told The Oklahoman.

'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me. Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1 a.m., he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.' 

Alan even shared a photo of him and his friends in his hotel room on Sunday, the day before his family was discovered and three days after they were killed. 

Gone to soon: Alan's 17-year-old sister Katherine (above) was only a junior in high school

Booked: Prosecutors are having the teen held without bail and may consider the death penalty

Good people: His parents John and Tinker (above with daughter Katherine) had recently cut of Alan financially after he repeatedly stole from them and other family members

Hicks said that Alan cried 'crocodile tears' after authorities told him about his parents deaths, and was only upset he had been caught.

The young man also seemed to make a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on both his Twitter and Instagram accounts, perhaps as a way to distance himself from the scene of the murder.  

Alibi: The young man shared a photo from his dorm room window on Thursday, the night his parents were killed, perhaps as an alibi

Tweet: he also went on Twitter to confirm his location, likely after getting home from shooting his mother, father and sister

Alan said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to inherit the money he needed to pay this person by inheriting money.

His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room on Wednesday turned up multiple stolen checks.  

Hicks also said that Alan told investigators that after shooting his parents he threw the gun he used, along with a DVD from the home's security system, in a nearby lake.   

Getaway: The weekend after he killed his parents he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, who luxurious rooftop pool can be seen above

Feeling fine: People who saw him in Dallas say Alan (above at his high school graduation) acted 'normal' as he partied with friends

Socio-snap: Alan shared this photo of his friends hanging at The Ritz while his parents and sister laid dead and undiscovered in their home

Appearing in court  yesterday, Alan was described as 'soft spoken' and 'unsteady on his feet,' crying when he was denied bail by the judge.

Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. 

His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. 

Court records also show Duncan police had been investigating Alan since August because of evidence he had forged checks totaling $17,500. 

It is also being reported he assaulted his mother two years ago after an disagreement with money. 

Salt of the earth: His father John (above with wife Tinker) was a well known local newspaper publisher

Tragic loos: Tinker (left) was described as a 'great neighbor' while Katherine (right) was said to always have a smile on her face

Scne of the crime: Alan shot all three in their family home

And there's more. 

In a police affidavit filed in August, 2013 officers met with John after he suspected his son was using a credit card not belonging to him.

According to  authorities they say they found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Alan took a trip to Paris.

He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft.

The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend.

His father phoned the police and Alan pleaded guilty in January of this year and he was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November.

As part of his punishment the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program. 

It is also believe he recently stole one of his mother's cards as well, or started one in her name without her knowledge. 

Vacation: Alan frequently posted photos of his trips, above in Paris

Italia: He also posted this snap of a trip to Rome

Big Apple: These two photos were taken in New York City, where he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton on central Park (left) and took a trip to the top of the Empire State Building

The boy liked to document his extravagant lifestyle, posting photos of his trips to Rome, Paris, London and New York City on his Instagram account.

Oddly enough, he never seems to be with friends or family members on these trips, but rather always alone.

His social media accounts also featured snaps of expensive watches and wallets and cars that may or may not have belonged to the troubled teen.   

'It's sad. It's very shocking,' said a 21-year-old neighbor, who asked to remain unnamed, about the deaths. 

'They were a good family. They would always help you out. If your car wouldn't start, they'd come over and jump it, or if your dog ran off they'd try to help you catch it. Just neighborly things.'

People started getting concerned when John, 50, the publisher of the local paper, The Marlow Review, did not turn up for work on Friday morning.

He also failed to cover the weekly high school football game, something he always does according to his employees. 

Materialistic: Alan also liked to show off his expensive purchases, sometimes in front of international landmarks for a classy touch, like this pic of an Omega watch in front of the Eiffel Tower

Not his: Here Alan snaps a pic in a car that is not his

Subtle: This photo of a drink catches a very expensive Louis Vuitton wallet at the bottom of the frame

'At this time, The Marlow Review asks the general public for prayers following the tragic deaths of John Hruby, our publisher, his wife, Tinker, and their daughter, Katherine,' said John's colleagues in a statement.

'Our staff endeavors to continue to serve Marlow to the best of our ability going forward.'

Meanwhile, friends and classmates of Katherine, 17, a volleyball player, held a vigil for her last night.

'She was such a good person and such good friend to all of us,' said teammate Carly Kirkand.

'She always had a smile on her face even when she had every reason not to. It's going to be hard because she was such a huge part of this team.'
