Hospital staff missed three vital 
opportunities to save a toddler with chicken pox and he would be alive 
today if they had acted, a coroner said yesterday.

Lewis Mullins was seen by doctors 
three times in three days after his mother became convinced his 
condition was deteriorating rapidly.

But on each occasion she was given painkillers to make her son more comfortable and sent home.

Grieving: Lewis' mother Jodie Conlay holds her son in a hospital ward. She told an inquest that she 'wished doctors had listened to her'

On the morning after the final 
hospital visit, 12-month-old Lewis, who had developed a bacterial 
infection, was found dead in his bed.

Rotherham coroner Nicola Munday said 
Lewis would have almost certainly have survived the infection had staff 
‘heeded’ the warning signs, carried out routine tests and treated him.

She added: ‘A number of nurses and 
doctors were involved in Lewis’s care over a short period of time but 
nobody looked at the entire picture.

‘Ultimately this led to Lewis’s death.
 Had appropriate treatment been given on each of those three occasions 
it is likely Lewis would have survived.’

His symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘were not properly heeded and acted upon’, she concluded.

The coroner recorded a narrative verdict which said Lewis died from pneumonia, likely to have been caused by the chicken pox.

Lewis’s parents, Jodie Conlay and 
Andrew Mullins, wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘soul
 destroying’ moment they realised more could have been done to save 
their son.

Miss Conlay had provided a ‘clear and 
comprehensive’ account of Lewis’ symptoms at the walk-in centre but 
significant information was not noted by the nurse and it was not passed
 on.

‘Given the significant change in 
Lewis’ condition I consider this was the first sign of the bacterial 
infection and there was a missed opportunity for investigations and a 
possible diagnosis at that time,’ she added.

‘In my view he was displaying sufficient symptoms to warrant further investigation.’

His symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘were not properly heeded and acted upon’, she concluded.

Tragic: One-year-old Lewis Mullins plays in a baby walker. He died after contracting chicken pox and doctors missed a bacterial infection three times

Delivering a narrative verdict the coroner said Lewis died from pneumonia which was likely to have been caused by the chicken pox.

Miss Conlay and Lewis’s father, Andrew Mullins, 32, wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘soul-destroying’ moment they realised more could have been done to save their son.

‘I still can’t believe that Lewis is no longer with us,’ said Miss Conlay. ‘He was such a content baby, a real happy chappie.

‘His big sister keeps telling me she misses her little brother. It has hit both myself and Andrew very hard.

‘Hearing that treatment given to Lewis could have been different and could have saved his life was completely soul destroying.

‘I just hope that changes can be made and more notice taken of parents’ concerns to try and prevent them from having to go through the same heartache.

‘I knew something was wrong but the doctors kept reassuring me.’

Miss Conlay is now calling for a national immunisation programme for chicken pox. Vaccination is routinely available in the United States and Canada, but it is not offered to children in the UK.

Miss Conlay, from Maltby, said her son had enjoyed normal health until falling ill with chickenpox after his four-year-old sister, Lacey, caught it.

He came out in blisters on his face, was running a temperature, had breathing problems and shaking episodes.

His face swelled like he had been in the ring with boxer Mike Tyson, she told the inquest.

She rushed her son to Rotherham’s NHS walk-in centre on Wednesday, March 30 last year and was told he had infected chickenpox.

But a questionnaire filled in by a nurse, which detailed Lewis’s pain, rash, high temperature, shaking episodes and breathing problems, was not passed to the GP who later saw him.

As a result the GP thought he was treating him for chickenpox and nothing more.

Lewis returned to hospital the following day and then the third, but on each occasion the chance to intervene with appropriate treatment was missed and he died on April 2.

Following Lewis’ death, Rotherham Hospital now gives antibiotics to all children they see with chickenpox.

They are also physically examined by a registrar and if needed by a senior doctor within four hours of admission.
