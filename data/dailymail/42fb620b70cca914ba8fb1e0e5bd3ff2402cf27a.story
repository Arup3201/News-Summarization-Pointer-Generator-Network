Breakdown: Tube passengers are forced to walk along tunnels between Baker Street and St John's Wood

London's transport system came under fire today after a major technical failure on the Underground saw hundreds stuck in stifling carriages on the hottest night of the year.

More than 770 passengers have been offered just £40 compensation after they had to be walked through tunnels last night because of a broken down train on the Jubilee Line.

There are fears the capital could become a 'laughing stock' if similar faults are repeated during this summer's Olympics, which kick off in a matter of weeks.

The faulty train was specially decorated with a bunting design for the Diamond Jubilee - but among those delayed when it ground to a halt were some of the Queen’s guests on their way to a celebration at the Royal Academy of Arts, attended by celebrities from the arts and fashion worlds.

The network's problems continued this morning when a signal failure at Embankment led to severe disruption on the Circle and District lines.

London Assembly Member and Labour’s transport spokesman Val Shawcross said: 'The Olympic Games opening ceremony is now less than nine weeks away and still ordinary commuters are being hit by delays caused by faulty track, faulty trains and faulty signals.

'Passengers on the Jubilee Line have endured months of shutdowns for maintenance and upgrade works that were supposed to stop this happening. So why are there still issues with the line? What will happen if the chaos happens during the Olympic Games? Quite simply the Mayor needs to get a grip, otherwise London could end up as an international laughing stock.'

Today, in an unprecedented move, Transport for London announced it would be making £40 'distress' pay outs for those caught in the nightmare journey.

But one passenger, Jennifer Siggs, who claimed temperatures soared to over 30 degrees, dismissed the compensation offer.

The train ground to a halt between Baker Street and St John’s Wood just after 5.30pm.

Ms Siggs, 27, an events co-ordinator at the Churchill War Rooms, said: 'Everyone was a bit huffy and distressed.

'It was sweaty and horrible, I didn't have any water.

'The woman sat next to me looked like she was going to have a panic attack.

'She was saying that her eight year old son at home didn't know where she was and he couldn't go to sleep without her being there.'

Ms Siggs added: 'A woman in my carriage said she felt unwell and she wanted to stand between the doors, I think she had a fit.'

'Then she slumped down on to the floor and the paramedics and police came.

'When we got off she was sitting up with an oxygen mask on.

'No one gave us any information, that's what made people most worried.

'Eventually the lights flickered on and the driver said we were going to walk three quarters of a mile along the tracks.

Hush money? Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) has offered £40 compensation to those delayed last night, but one passenger said TfL officials were simply trying to 'stop people complaining'

'I was one of the last people out and it was quite bizarre to see hundreds of people stretched out in front of me.

'It was for me even harder because I had to leap from plank to plank in my heels.'

Ms Siggs said TfL were 'just trying to cover themselves and stop people complaining' by offering £40 compensation.

She added: 'This shouldn't be happening in 2012 that you're stuck for two-and-a-half hours and no one tells you anything.

'I'm concerned about the tube during the Olympics, because if something like this happens now, what will happens with trains full of distressed people who can't speak the language? It will be hell.'

Ms Siggs finally got home to Acton at about 10pm - more than four hours after leaving work.

London Ambulance Service said one patient was treated for breathing difficulties and taken to the Royal Free Hospital, while another was treated for a 'pre-existing condition'.

Another passenger caught up in today’s Tube delays said it took her three hours to travel from Liverpool Street to Victoria, adding: 'There was little or no information - the only thing we were told was that we were going nowhere. I had to catch a bus instead - and they were all packed.'

Nigel Holness, London Underground operations director, apologised for last night’s disruption, saying: 'This was caused by a faulty train between Baker Street and St Johns Wood which led to the suspension of the line between London Bridge and Finchley Road.

'Our staff tried to move the train, which stalled at around 1735hrs, using a train to push it from behind. This was not successful and we subsequently took the decision to walk passengers off the train.

'This is clearly not the level of service our customers have a right to expect, and we will be refunding those affected.'

LU drafted in additional staff from its special requirements team to help passengers off, saying they could not be disembarked sooner as it was thought the train could be pushed forward using the other train.

However this was not possible, partly due to the slope of the tunnel.

Mike Brown, LU’s managing director, said: 'The Tube is staffed and maintained to the highest standards and to a level that has made it the safest significant sized railway in Europe.

'The fact is that we have just recorded the most reliable year on record, carrying more passengers than ever before and operating more services. But we will never be complacent and accept that in the last few days our customers have not had the level of service they are right to expect.

'That is why we and the Mayor are committed to working to improve reliability even further as we go into this exciting summer for London.'

Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'This is shaping up to be a pre-Olympic London transport week of hell with London mayor Boris Johnson and his officials claiming a brilliant service while millions of Londoners know better.

'We are paying a heavy price for a programme of cuts to staffing and maintenance that has reduced the transport system to total chaos just weeks away from the Olympics and the blame lies firmly with the mayor and his senior officials.'
