A 14-year-old boy who two years ago received an adult sentence of 25-years in prison for his part in the killing of a friend’s stepfather has had his conviction quashed and will now have his case heard again. 

Paul Henry Gingerich is the youngest person in the state of Indiana ever sentenced to prison as an adult, when aged 12 he was sentenced for conspiracy to commit murder.

The unanimous decision to overturn that sentence was announced Tuesday by the Indiana Court of Appeals. They found that the juvenile court in Kosciusko County ‘abused its discretion’ in 2010 by not giving Gingerich’s attorneys more time to prepare arguments that his case should stay in the juvenile system.

Gingerich’s attorneys were given four business days, despite their pleas for more time. Similar cases typically offer defense attorneys as much as three months to prepare.

The result was that Gingerich’s case was waived to the Circuit Court - the adult system. Facing the possibility of more than 45 years in jail, Gingerich pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced as an adult to 25 years. With credits for good behavior, he was expected to serve just under half the time, being released at age 24.

Gingerich’s mother, Nicole, said she 
was very happy about the decision by the appeals court.

'I’m very positive and confident that
 my son will be tried as a juvenile,' Gingerich said, 'and that he will 
be out a lot sooner than he was supposed to be.'

Gingerich was one of three juveniles from a small town in northeastern Indiana charged with killing 49-year-old Phillip Danner as part of a plot to run away to Arizona in April 2010. Authorities say he fired one of the shots that hit Danner.

The Indiana attorney general's office did not immediately say whether it would appeal Tuesday's decision to the state Supreme Court.

‘Among the most disheartening cases seen in the criminal justice system are those involving young people charged with extremely violent crimes. For prosecutors and judges, these are among the most difficult cases as well in terms of balancing the rights of the juvenile with the safety of the community,’ Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement.

Monica Foster, the public defender who handled Gingerich's appeal, said the trial judge rushed to judgment without considering the boy's maturity, and the appeals court agreed.

Since he was convicted, Gingerich has been incarcerated at the Pendleton Juvenile Correctional in Pendleton, Indiana

The court's ruling noted that Gingerich didn't understand the proceedings. The court cited a psychologist who found that the boy thought the judge was obligated to find him guilty, didn't understand plea bargaining, and didn't understand many of the words used by his lawyer.

The appellate court rejected the state's arguments that Gingerich had given up his right to appeal as part of the plea agreement and found that a probation officer had provided the trial judge misinformation about the availability of private detention facilities.

Going back to juvenile court could still be a gamble for the boy, who is now 14 and is eligible for release when he's 24. There's no guarantee the case wouldn't be sent to adult court again, and Gingerich could risk a longer prison sentence if he is charged again with murder as an adult.
