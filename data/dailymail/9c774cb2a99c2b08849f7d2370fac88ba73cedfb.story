Hundreds of stroke patients die each year due to a lack of doctors and nurses at weekends.

Patients are a third more likely to die if admitted to units which are poorly staffed on Saturday mornings, a study found.

The few doctors who do work weekends are ‘firefighting’ in A&E, leaving stroke patients at risk of being neglected, researchers said.

Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, is leading a major review of how hospitals can encourage senior staff to work at weekends. 

It follows a series of studies suggesting that patients admitted on a Saturday or Sunday are up to 16 per cent more likely to die. 

But the doctors’ union, the British Medical Association, has described the plans as ‘unworkable’ as the NHS cannot afford to employ more senior staff at weekends.

Research led by Professor Anthony Rudd, a stroke consultant at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, looked at 56,666 patients admitted to 103 hospital stroke units in England from 2011 to 2012.

Because so few specialist stroke doctors work at weekends the researchers looked at the number of nurses on wards at 10am on a Saturday.

They found the chances of stroke victims dying within 30 days of being admitted on a Saturday were a third higher on wards where there were an average of three nurses for every 20 beds compared to those with three nurses to 10 beds.

NHS guidelines state there should be at least three nurses for every ten patients on a stroke unit at all times.

But figures show that only 27 per cent of the 183 NHS hospitals with stroke units have at least three nurses for ten patients at weekends.

Professor Rudd said: ‘Even really big hospitals have very few staff at nights and weekends and most of those are going to be firefighting admissions down in the emergency department.

‘Patients sitting on a ward – there’s less observation 20 or 30 years ago when every ward would have had their own doctors on 24 hours a day.

‘When I was training, whether you were doing urology (kidneys and bladder) or neurology (the brain), every team would have had their rota. That’s all gone now.

‘In that situation, we are very dependent on skilled nurses to recognise when someone might be on the brink of developing a chest infection or a blood clot on the lungs or any other complication that can happen with stroke.

‘If those conditions do get picked up early, they are much more effectively treated.

‘Nursing levels can make a big difference to whether or not you survive after a stroke.’

Around 125,000 patients suffer a stroke in England every year and they cause 40,000 deaths

The study – published in the journal PLOS One - did not calculate exactly how many of these can be directly blamed on a lack of weekend staff.

The study found that the risk of patients dying within 30 days on units which did have three nurses for every ten patients was 11.2 per cent.

But this rose to 15.2 per cent on units which had half the safe level of nurses – three for every 20 beds.

Jon Barrick, Chief Executive of the Stroke Association said: ‘Stroke is an emergency and it can happen at any time.

Patients should receive specialist care around the clock and a lack of staff will mean they will suffer unnecessarily.

‘There is a considerable body of evidence showing the level of care you receive in the first few hours after your stroke, as well as in the longer-term, can make a big difference to your recovery.’

Dr Peter Carter, Chief Executive and General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘It’s unacceptable that so many hospitals are still failing to make sure they have enough nurses on duty to care for stroke patients.

‘If a hospital has enough nurses in place, stroke patients are more likely to survive and to recover.’
