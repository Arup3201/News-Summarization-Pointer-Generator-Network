A keen young job seeker who has failed to find full time work despite sending off 50 job applications has offered himself up on eBay as a live-in maid-for a month in a bid to improve his CV. 

Ben Burchfield, 20, from Worthing, West Sussex, posted the unique advert offering to be a live-in maid for a month, working seven days a week for just £100, and says he is even happy to sleep in a shed.

The determined jobseeker says he will 'do anything asked of him,' and can do everything from cooking bacon butties, cutting hair, cooking and cleaning to moving hazardous waste for his potential employers.

He will carry out dusting, mopping, hoovering and 'bog cleaning' and even has his own hazmat protective suit and mask.

Mr Burchfield's advert states: 'This ad is for a month period of my work services, but you have to include meals for myself and accommodation (a shed is good enough but anything more is appreciated) my working week is seven days so you get a full 28 days of my services.

'I can kinda cook meals which consist of bacon butties, toast, pizzas, chips general easy cooking really, takes the edge off your day if you have a busy lifestyle as meals will be cooked for when you get home etc.

'I can buy the food supplies from the shops as needed. 

'Life is so fast paced and people don't have time these days just to sit back and enjoy themselves. They don't get a life to themselves.

'They go to work, come home, clean and go got bed. I'll have dinner on the table. Although I am not a fancy chef if you want something fancy I will give it a go. I am open to anything.'

Today Mr Burchfield said: 'I am currently unemployed and I really want to work. I suppose I am not normal. 

'I don't want to sit around, I want to go out there and try new things and learn new skills.'

In the advert he says he will do everything from dusting, mopping, gardening and hoovering to 'bog cleaning'

'I will do anything I can to improve my CV. I just want to make the most of what is out there. 

'I left education with just GSCEs so I thought I should get experience in anything I can to prove myself. I suppose this is a last resort.'

Mr Burchfield attended Durrington Primary and Secondary Schools, Worthing, where he gained eight GSCEs in science subjects, maths, art and design, English, information technology and business and communication.

He went on to study Art and Design at Northbrook College before transferring course to study Motorsport Engineering.

But Mr Burchfield left his course mid-way through and before starting a year-long job as a cleaner at Severn Water, completed a 12-week Princes Trust course in team work, community skills and employment skills and another in retail media.

He said: 'Since leaving work at the end of 2013 I have had a few gardening jobs. 

'I have probably sent off more than 50 job applications in varying fields and I have heard nothing back from any of them. 

Mr Burchfield (pictured) says he will even move anywhere in order to carry out the job - even Scotland

'It's pretty disheartening. You send off all these applications and get nothing back.'

In that time Mr Burchfield has also applied for five apprenticeships in the Worthing area in different fields ranging from aviation to security alarm services.

He says his dream job would be to work in the aviation industry and he had applied for an apprenticeship with BAE Systems.

He said: 'I got to the final round. I had to go to Doncaster for an aptitude test but lost out on the next round by three points. 

'This was the only one I got an interview with. It has been really difficult to find jobs in the aviation industry let alonne just getting a regular job. 

'I have had temp jobs at Tesco but have never been offered full-time employment.'

Prior to listing the advert, Mr Burchfield had gone to his local job centre to look for work but soon realised that all the jobs he had gained were from his own independent search.

He said: 'I realised I had found all the jobs I had ever had on my own. 

'Also I didn't want to claim benefits as I never really thought I needed them.

'I just thought someone else would need those benefits more than me.

'I wanted to try something different with the eBay advert and see if this would appeal to anyone. I will do anything, sleep anywhere - a shed so long as it isn't too leaky.

'I'll go anywhere - up to Scotland if that's where I am needed. 

'It will be great to see the country.'

In his advert Mr Burchfield says: 'I have previous experience in cleaning as I used to work for a cleaning company at southern water HQ, the tasks which included cleaning desks, dusting, moping, hoovering, toilet roll replenishment, bog cleaning, buffing floors, empty rubbish bins etc, can also clean carpets if you have the machine to do it.'

Mr Burchfield is also experienced in gardening - including mowing, planting and dead heading flowers

'I can cut hair numbers I do are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 anything else go to a barber.

'I also have experience in gardening which includes all garden tasks from mowing to planting dead heading flowers.

'I can do DIY, best experience in light bulb changing and general fixing.

'I will ask to be picked up from my location and dropped off when the month period is up and will start when payment is made, looks may differ from photo as I have a winter head hair coat keeps me warm at the moment, no real commitments so my full attention can go into this month period of labour, I am a smoker just to let you know,

'I have basic first aid which consists of phoning doctors or ambulance if needed and any more information can be requested if needed. No time wasters please and payment to be made within the week of auction finishing.'

While the advert has garnered more than 100 views so far, no bids have been made. The auction ends today.
