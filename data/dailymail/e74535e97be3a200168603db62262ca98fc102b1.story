A couple from North Naples, Florida were arrested on Monday after they allegedly beat up theirÂ  friend because she graciously paid their tab for them while they were at the bank.

The Naples Daily News reports that the couple was told that they could use the bar's ATM but that they decided to go to the bank instead.

When the couple returned to the drinking-hole they discovered that their friend, whose identity has not been released, paid their tab and that's when the two women allegedly began arguing and hitting each other.

Witnesses recall that after Streight began jousting with her friend that another man came to break up the fight.

That's supposedly when McEnry stepped in and told the man to stop.

Witnesses say that the man turned to punch McEnery who began spitting blood from a ripe wound on his face.

The Collier County sheriff's arrived on the scene later to find Streight angry and covered in blood.

'Get me the f***ing fire department, I need some f****ing water,' she allegedly cried when they didn't bring her a glass.

Streight and her boyfriend McEnery told told police that they were attacked by a group of people but none of the other witnesses supported that account.

According to the police report, when police asked the couple why they were covered in blood theyreplied, 'because these mother f****ers are kicking the s**t out of us for no reason.'
