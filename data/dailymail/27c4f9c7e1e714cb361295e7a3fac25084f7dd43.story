A father who was left 'moments from death' by a major heart attack was told he had to return to work or lose his benefits while he lay in hospital waiting for quadruple bypass surgery.

Colin Rogers, 58, was hooked up to heart monitors when he received a phone call telling him he was expected to continue a government work programme.

The father, from the Wirral, Merseyside, said concerned nurses noticed his heart rate beginning to accelerate after the call to his mobile phone.

Mr Rogers was admitted to Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, after suffering severe chest pain.

His wife, Carol, was later told the former factory worker was 'moments from death' as his heart failed on September 27.

Specialists said he had to undergo quadruple heart bypass surgery, but while he was waiting for the operation, on October 6, Mr Rogers received a phone call from A4e - a company contracted to provide the government work programme.

A manager at the company told Mr Rogers he had signed up to the scheme and would have to continue with it. 

Mr Rogers, who is now recovering at home, told the Liverpool Echo: 'I couldn't believe that they were ringing me because I had given my wife a list of people who needed to be told and she had contacted the Job Centre and told them A4e needed to be informed what had happened to me. 

'So I was completely shocked and I said to the guy I couldn't believe he was phoning me, that he was supposed to have been told that I had a heart attack.

'This guy was persisting about wanting to discuss the next plan of action but I said I was ending the conversation and put the phone down.'

Mr Rogers, who worked for Champion Spark Plugs until the factory closed down, said a nurse noticed his heart rate monitor and asked if the 58-year-old was all right, but he was too 'embarrassed' to tell her what had happened.

Back at home: Mr Rogers, who is now at home recovering, said he was shocked at the call and hung up on the A4e manager

He added: 'I was disgusted with what had happened. I want to work, but all I seem to be doing is fighting these people.'

Mrs Rogers said: 'He was not supposed to be stressed. It's been horrendous, Even though my doctor said he may never work again, they are saying to us he has to finish the back to work programme.'

Their son, Craig, told MailOnline: 'He's at home and is trying to recover from a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery.'

A spokesman for A4e said: 'The telephone call that was made to Mr Rogers had been pre-arranged two months earlier, and when we rang him, we were unaware that he had been taken seriously ill.

'A4e had not been directly informed that Mr Rogers was seriously ill before we made the call to him, and we could not have known he was in hospital.

'The conversation was very brief and as soon as we realised Mr Rogers was in hospital, we ended the call. All the correct procedures were followed, and no further contact has been made.

'Our adviser apologised profusely at the time. We wish Mr Rogers a full recovery and are obviously sorry that this has caused him distress.'

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said correct procedures had been followed.
