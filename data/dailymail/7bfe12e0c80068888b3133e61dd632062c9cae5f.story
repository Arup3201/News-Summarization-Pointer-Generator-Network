Builder Lee Goddard opened the sluice gates outside his home allowing tens of thousands of litres of water to pass through 

A builder who broke open sluice gates to protect his own property at the height of last winter’s floods sent 45,000 cubic metres of water rushing towards a local village.

The water surged into an adjacent field, into an irrigation channel and into the village of Thorney on the Somerset levels.

Yesterday, builder Lee Goddard was fined just £1,000 after becoming the first person in Britain to be convicted of opening a sluice gate.

The Slabgate Sluice, in Hambridge, is used to control the flow of water from the River Isle to West Moor, next to Thorney, and is opened in the summer to send water to the moor for cattle grazing. 

Though prosecutors said it could not be confirmed whether Goddard’s actions had directly caused damage to properties in Thorney, he was accused of exacerbating the plight of villagers.

A court heard Goddard, 40, used a crowbar to open the gates and smashed a padlock before using screws to hold the gates open.

The father-of-two had previously admitted contravening land drainage laws by ‘interfering’ with the sluice. 

Yesterday he was handed a £1,000 fine, ordered to pay £415 compensation, £1,000 legal fees and a £100 surcharge.

Prosecuting, Simon Cooper told the court that meetings were held between the drainage board and locals during the flooding and it was decided the gates could not be opened.

He said: ‘The effect of opening the gates was that water levels in West Moor rose.

The sluice gate at Hambridge had been padlocked shut in a bid to prevent further flooding to the Levels 

‘Properties in Thorney were already at risk. Because the defendant opened the gate there was an increase of water levels.

‘It transpired that Mr Goddard was boasting at a New Year’s Eve party that he had opened the gates.’

Mr Cooper told the court that it was unclear how much of the blame for flooding in Thorney could be placed with Goddard.

He added: ‘The area was flooded anyway. The gates exacerbated the problem.’

Goddard used a crowbar to wedge them open in an effort to stop his own home from being flooded last year

But residents say opening the sluice gate led to devastating consequences. Julian Temperley believes his 99-year-old father Neville’s house was flooded as a result of the gate being lifted. 

‘I believe my father is not in his house today because of the actions of this man in Hambridge,’ he said earlier this year. Neville Temperley, is unlikely to return to his home until April.

Another flooded resident, Rita Dobben, added: ‘It could have been a matter of centimetres that saved us.

‘If we hadn’t have had that extra water that the sluice gate being opened caused into the floodwater that was already there, we may well have just got away with it, but we didn’t.’

Taunton magistrates’ court heard Goddard opened the 4.4ft square gates used to control the flow of water between December 20 and 23 last year.

He was brought before the courts in a private prosecution by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board. He pleaded guilty to the offence in August.

Sentencing him, District Judge David Taylor said his actions were selfish.

The judge added: ‘This sluice gate you opened was part of a historic system for controlling the flow of water.

‘It is clear to me you would have known last year was the wettest for many, many years.’ 

At the height of the floods, hundreds of people across Somerset were forced to flee their houses. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated and villages were cut off.

Goddard said he had lived in his current property for 28 years and opening the gates had never been a problem before.

He said: ‘If they [the sluice gates] were open for two hours, we wouldn’t flood. It goes into the field, then into the canal and into the river. The rivers are not being maintained.’

Villages became entirely cut off for weeks with emergency supplies transported to residents in boats
