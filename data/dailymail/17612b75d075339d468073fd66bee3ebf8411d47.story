HTC is gearing up for a major event next week in which it’s expected to launch a follow-up to its award-winning HTC One handset - dubbed HTC One M8.

Leaked photos and videos began circulating towards the end of last year and have been picking up speed as the launch event approaches, but the latest leak has come from a surprising source.

An eBay seller in New York not only posted a listing earlier this week claiming to be the new phone, the phone subsequently sold for $499.99 (£301) after five bids.

HTC is gearing up for a major event next week in which it's expected to launch the HTC One M8. Leaked photos and videos began circulating towards the end of last year. An eBay seller in New York then posted a listing earlier this week claiming to be the new phone, it subsequently sold for $499.99 (£301) after five bids

The handset is expected to have a 5-inch, full 1080p HD screen, a 
quad-core 2.3Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 32GB of built-in storage.

It is additionally rumoured to have a MicroSD slot meaning the phone can be increased up to 128GB.

Many reports claim the handset will have a dual-lens, rear-facing UltraPixel camera, with a 5MP camera on the front.

It is expected to run on the latest version of the HTC Sense software, on top of Android 4.4 KitKat.

Although the box shown in the pictures is labelled HTC One, the design of the phone on the front appears to match previously leaked photos, including the grey case and on-screen buttons.

Similarly, the specifications listed in the description box mirror what other sites are claiming to be the features of the new phone.

These include a 5-inch, full 1080p HD screen, a quad-core 2.3Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and the fact the phone’s storage can be increased up to 128GB.

Elsewhere, the seller, known only as raj1665, makes reference to the feature that has been most widely talked about – the dual-lens, rear-facing camera.

The listing describes the camera as UltraPixel, as seen on the original HTC One, but did not reveal the exact size.

The handset's features are rounded off with 2GB of RAM, dual front stereo speakers with built-in amplifiers, 32GB built-in storage and Bluetooth. It’s listed as ‘brand new, never used, in original package.’

HTC appeared to be languishing behind the likes of Samsung and Apple until it launched its critically acclaimed HTC One last year.

It won the Best Smartphone of 2013 at the Pocket-lint awards last year, and during February’s Mobile World Congress, among other accolades.
