Wayne Rooney insists Manchester United can win the Premier League title in Louis van Gaal’s first season.

The Dutchman has set himself a top-four target after inheriting a team in decline last summer, and warned it may take the rest of his three-year deal to turn United around.

But after the 20-time champions recorded their sixth win in a row with Sunday’s 3-0 victory over Liverpool, Rooney claimed United can challenge Chelsea and Manchester City as they head into a busy Christmas programme.

‘We have to believe we can win the title,’ said Rooney. ‘We are eight points behind and coming into a busy period. If we can win our games and the others have one bad result then there is nothing there. We have to keep winning and hopefully get back to the top. 

'We have a great team spirit. Everybody is pulling together. We all want to win, we all want to be successful. As long as we keep working we won’t be far away.’

Rooney believes it is a good sign that United are winning games without playing at their best, and warned there is enough title-winning experience in the squad to mark them out as contenders.

Rooney excelled in a midfield role against Liverpool and believes it is a transition that will help him to extend his top-flight career.

‘It’s a different system and a new position again for me but I’ve played it before,’ he added.

‘It can help me in years to come. I feel I can drop back and it will give me an extra few years at the end of my career.’

Rooney and his fellow United's stars took the chance to have a second Christmas party of the season, heading out to a bar in central Manchester to celebrate on Monday night, meanwhile.

Rooney, the club captain and the player charged with organising both parties, led the way, as the United squad visited Wing's, the Abercromby  and The Neighbourhood Bar in three separate coaches.

Rooney took to the stage to sing with Ed Sheeran at the Abercromby recently.

Neighbourhood was thought to be booked out for the United squad until 2am, with Van Gaal's side not in midweek action the players have the chance to let their hair down. 

Manchester City stormed to the Premier League title last season with United finishing in seventh place

Meanwhile, United midfielder Ander Herrera has been named in an alleged case of match fixing involving a Spanish La Liga match between his former club Real Zaragoza and Levante on the final day of the 2010-11 season, when a 2-1 win meant Zaragoza avoided relegation.

Spain’s anti-corruption prosecutor filed its case in a Valencia court yesterday, alleging that the Levante players were paid a total of €965,000 (£766,292) to deliberately lose the game.
