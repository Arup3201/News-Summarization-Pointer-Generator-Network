Most Premier League footballers these days are more than a little guarded.

However, Manchester City players let their defences down when they left some rather revealing doodles behind during a recent press conference in Abu Dhabi.

Striker Sergio Aguero, midfielder Fernandinho and goalkeeper Willy Caballero all released their artistic flair during the event.

Prof Cary Cooper reckons Sergio Aguero's drawings hint that rivals Chelsea are the devil

Fiery Argentinian ace Aguero unleashed a smoking devil-type creature on his page.

While Fernandinho clearly had his eyes on getting out of the press conference and back to training as he neatly drew a football pitch.

Goalkeeper Caballero displayed a keen eye as he drew a smart business man walking away from his car at the end of the day.

Psychology expert believes Willy Caballero's design shows he is keen on getting on with the job in hand

Professor Cary Cooper, a psychology expert at Lancaster University, believes each design shows a reflection of the person or how they are feeling,

He said: 'I think Aguero's mind might be going to the Premier League match against Chelsea that's coming up. I think Chelsea may be the devil-type character.

'This game coming up is the biggest game for City this season because if they win that game, psychologically it will be more than three points. City is the lion while Chelsea is the devil – and they are after the devil.

Prof Cooper, a psychology expert at Lancaster University, believes Fernandinho is focused on the game

'Caballero's skilled scribblings show his willingness to get on with the job – despite defeat against Arsenal.

He added: 'I think this is a perception of himself. He's saying "I'm in a job just like any other job – I drive to work, I do my job, it's just a game". He's also a very talented artist.

Fernandinho, Cooper says, is: 'Totally focused on football, It does seem like he's tried to incorporate the letterhead into the goalposts, in which case he could be saying we are the current kings and we are going to knock Chelsea off the top.'
