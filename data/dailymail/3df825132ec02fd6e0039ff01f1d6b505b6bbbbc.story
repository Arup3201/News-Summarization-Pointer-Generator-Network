His spangled costumes have been the subject of a V&A retrospective while his Ziggy Stardust period has inspired Jean Paul Gaultier among many others.

Now David Bowie is set for a fashionable foray into film according to Womenswear Daily, who reported that the singer has been signed up to star in Louis Vuitton's latest campaign.

According to the fashion industry bible, Bowie will appear in part two of the label's L'Invitation au Voyage advertising film.

Sources inside Louis Vuitton told WWD that Bowie was filmed for the campaign in Venice during the summer.

The first part of L'Invitation au Voyage appeared last November and starred model Arizona Muse who was seen running through the Louvre before jumping into a red and white striped hot air balloon.

If the reports prove to be true, Bowie will be the latest in a long line of singing superstars to pose for the French fashion powerhouse.

Madonna caused controversy after striking a series of provocative poses when she appeared in a 2009 campaign for the brand.

The year before, Vuitton signed up Rolling Stones hellraiser Keith Richards and U2 singer Bono has also appeared alongside wife Ali Hewson.

Another singer to make the grade was rapper Kanye West, who along with designing a pair of trainers for the brand, chose to pose for Vuitton in 2009 alongside then girlfriend Amber-Rose.

Other famous names to have struck a pose for the luxury goods specialist include John Travolta, Jennifer Lopez, and Uma Thurman.
