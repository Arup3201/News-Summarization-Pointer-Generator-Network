Two British servicemen who were shot dead by members of the Afghan police force in Helmand on Saturday were named by the Ministry of Defence today.

Lance Corporal Lee Thomas Davies, 27, from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was killed alongside Corporal Brent John McCarthy, 25, of the Royal Air Force at a patrol base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province.

The servicemen were providing security for a meeting with local officials when two people wearing Afghan police uniforms opened fire.

Today, the family of Cpl McCarthy released a statement which read: 'Brent was a loving, sensitive young man. He excelled at sport and had the whole world in front of him.

'He loved his family dearly and will always be a hero to his niece Miajay. Brent will be sadly missed, not only by us but also by his loving partner Sarah and her devoted family.

'Life will never be the same for any of us. We will love you always. God bless.'

Cpl McCarthy and L/Cpl Davies were 
attending a meeting as part of a Police Advisory Team at the local 
Afghan Uniformed Police headquarters near Patrol Base Attal at the time 
of the attack.

The pair came
under small arms fire, during which both were fatally injured. It is 
thought that two assailants were responsible for the attack. Secretary 
of State for Defence Philip Hammond paid tribute to the pair.

Philip Hammond paid tribute to the servicemen saying 'Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them'

He said: 'I send out my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Corporal Brent McCarthy and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, whose lives were cut tragically short by a cowardly act of aggression.

'Both servicemen were performing an invaluable role, training and mentoring Afghan police, helping to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be a place from which international terrorists can launch attacks on our society.

'Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them.'

Cpl McCarthy was born into a service family in Hanover, Germany, before returning to the Midlands, where he grew up in Telford, Shropshire.

He joined the Royal Air Force in August 2008 and later joined the RAF Police.

He was described by family and friends as 'a man of many talents and diverse interests' and was a keen football and hockey player and also played the drums.

Cpl McCarthy was embedded with the Welsh Guards as part of the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group at the time of his death.

He leaves behind his father John, mother Sarah, sister Jodie, his partner Sarah and his niece Miajay and nephew Kyron.

Lieutenant Colonel Dino Bossi, 
Commanding Officer Police Mentoring and Advisory Group, 1st Battalion 
The Welsh Guards, said: 'His intelligence, ready wit and his desire to 
muck in and take part in all aspects of communal life meant that he 
fitted seamlessly into an extremely tight team.

'Corporal
McCarthy was extremely popular and hugely respected among the men with 
whom he lived and fought - not always an easy trick for a military 
policeman from another service, but one he achieved with ease and some 
style.

'Ever to the fore and
sharing danger and discomfort, his light-hearted approach to life, 
easygoing nature and cool professionalism made him a natural adviser to 
the Afghan National Police.

'On 12th May, alongside his comrade Lance Corporal Lee Davies, he was taken from us suddenly and violently.

'All of us in the Police Mentoring and
Advisory Group, whether Welsh Guards, Royal Military Police or RAF, are
devastated by his loss but resolved to press on in the memory of his 
sacrifice.

'To his family we extend our heartfelt sympathies and the knowledge that he will always be remembered among us.'

L/Cpl Davies, from Carmarthen, Wales, passed out from Catterick in April 2010, before joining the Welsh Guards.

He
was described as an 'exemplary member of the Welsh Guards' and was 'an 
extremely popular and respected member of his company and platoon'.

Lt Col Bossi said: 'Lance Corporal Lee Davies loved being a soldier - it was who he was.

'He
passed out from the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in April 2010. 
He swiftly made a name for himself for his enthusiasm, fitness and 
professionalism as an infantry soldier and in less than two years was 
promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal.

'To have made such a profound impact so early in his Army career speaks volumes about the quality of the man we have lost today.

'Lance Corporal Davies was very much the up and coming Junior Non-Commissioned Officer; he had big plans and the personal qualities to make his ambitions a reality. He was a sports fanatic, both watching and playing, and would throw himself into any outdoor activity.

'His passion for motor sports would see him up until all hours to watch a rally or a grand prix. In his personal life Lance Corporal Davies was a livewire who enjoyed nothing more than a night on the town. He was the living embodiment of the Army’s work hard, play hard ethos.'

He added that he was a 'formidably talented team commander' and that the Welsh Guards 'have lost a man of inestimable promise'.

This year 22 Nato troops have been killed by Afghan allies in so-called ‘green-on-blue’ incidents. Last year 35 servicemen were killed in such attacks.

And four of the 20 British servicemen to die this year have been murdered by so-called ‘friendly’ forces.

On
March 26, Sergeant Luke Taylor, 33, of the Royal Marines and Lance 
Corporal Michael Foley, 25, of the Adjutant General’s Corps, were 
murdered by a rogue Afghan soldier who was trying to gain access to 
their fortified base in Lashkar Gah.

Yesterday Defence Secretary Philip Hammond insisted the attacks were rare.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘British forces work alongside Afghan forces every day with thousands of contacts with them every day.

‘This is a country that has an insurgency... and, sadly, occasionally, these events occur.

‘We don’t yet know what the motive was, we don’t yet know whether this was an insurgent who’d infiltrated the police or whether it was a policeman who simply had a grievance of some kind.

‘This is a society where people traditionally settle grievances  by violence.’

In the hours after Saturday’s killings, there were conflicting reports about what happened.
