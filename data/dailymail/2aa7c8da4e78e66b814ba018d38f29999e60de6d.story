A Utah man who spoke about his 'temper' on Facebook was found dead Sunday night with his 2-year-old son in an apparent murder-suicide.

Bryson Drew, 21, was found with a single gunshot wound to the head in the basement of a Spanish Fork, Utah, home by his sister at 8:40 p.m. Sunday, according to KSL. Along with a suicide note, police found Drew's son Chanse in a bedroom with blunt force trauma injuries.

The note did not give a reason for the deaths, which police believe resulted from a murder-suicide.

Under investigation: Police are looking into the apparent murder-suicide of Bryson Drew, 21, and his son Chanse, 2, who were both found dead in Utah

Tragic: Police said 2-year-old Chanse was found dead with blunt force trauma injuries in the same home his father, Bryson Drew ,21, was found with a single gunshot wound to the head and a suicide note

'It briefly just stated how the deceased wanted some property passed on to relatives,' Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matthew Johnson told KSL.

'There are a lot of questions left unanswered. We may never know why he may have done this," Johnson also said according to The Salt Lake City Tribune.

Drew's father told KSL they believe it was an accident, adding the family has letters from Drew showing  'extreme remorse in what happened'.

'We may never know exactly what happened in those final moments in the house down there,' Delbert Drew said. 'Something went terribly wrong in a matter of moments.'

They were found in Drew's grandparents' home, police said. Chanse had been staying with his father for a long time, but his mother and Drew had an 'informal joint custody'.

Home: The bodies of Bryson Drew, 21, and his son Chanse, 2, were found by Drew's sister in their grandparent's home in Spanish Fork, Utah, where they had been staying

Too soon: Chanse Drew, 2, was found dead in his grandparents home in Utah with blunt force trauma injuries

Mystery: Police are still investigating how and why Bryson Drew, 21, and his son Chanse, 2, died in Utah. Drew was found with a gunshot wound and a suicide note

Though police reported Drew had no history of drug abuse, mental illness or alcohol abuse, Drew spoke about his 'temper' in a Facebook wall post thanking friends and family on May 11.

'Just
wanna take the time to thank the people that keep my head up, give me 
good advice, and keep me threw the day,' Drew wrote. 'Ashley MissTwiztid
Drew my sis helps me keep calm any time my temper gets up.'

Drew mentioned his son Chanse in the post: 'My son chanse who makes my day being his goofy self just like his dad'. He also thanked his mother and father and thanked friends for understanding the 'horrible situation' he was going through.

'Not being rude but i love my son chanse more than anything in this world. but i still love you all,' the post finished.

Love: Bryson Drew, 21, posted frequently about his 2-year-old son Chanse on Facebook, sharing an image left that says 'I love my son with all my heart'

Happy: Police are still investigating the death of 2-year-old Chanse Drew in Utah

Police said Drew's family was 'shocked' by the deaths.

'Several
of the neighbors were outside last night while we were conducting our 
investigation and they are just really sad for the family at this time,'
Johnson told KSL. 'Their thoughts are with the family. It's just 
something that you hope you never have to have to deal with.'

Following reports of the apparent murder-suicide, Drew's father stressed on Facebook that these were still 'accusations'. 

'There is a story on ksl this morning that has left our family devastated beyond words,' Delbert Drew wrote. 'The accusations made are not founded on anything but speculation. If you choose to read this story please take the time to read the father/grandfathers comments, and others, before passing judgement as we do not feel the media portrayed the story with all the facts.'

Drew wrote about a future with his son and father on Facebook last month.

'My awesome dad. when chanse gets old can me we please please please find a 69 or 70's dodge charger to restore i would love to have something me and you and chanse bult with are own hands....' Drew wrote in a post tagging his father. 'PS: love chanse and bryson that are up at 4 in the morning because chanse had a nightmare love ya dad/papa'

Grandpa: Delbert Drew wrote on his Facebook the family is 'devastated' after reports of his son Bryson Drew and his grandson Chanse dying in an apparent murder-suicide

Forever young: Chanse Drew was only 2-years-old when he died

Delbert Drew responded to the post saying he loves Chanse 'just the way he is'.

'I would love for him to stay that cute adorable little man too,' Drew's father wrote in the comment. 'But he will grow up to help you be a better person and Dad !!!'

Drew and his son were taken to the State of Utah Medical Examiner's Office where autopsies will be performed to determine the official cause of death.

The police investigation is ongoing.
