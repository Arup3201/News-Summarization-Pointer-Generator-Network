Key match stats (supplied by Opta) 

Spurs have won four and lost just one of their last six against the Seagulls (D1).

Brighton have won more away games in this season’s League Cup (2) than they had in the last 19 seasons combined (1).

The one previous League Cup meeting between these sides came in the 1982/83 competition, when Spurs won 2-1 on aggregate in a two-legged second round tie.

Tottenham have won 10 of their last 11 in this competition against lower ranked sides, scoring in all 11 games in this run.

The Lilywhites have scored in each of their last 24 home games in the League Cup.

The Seagulls have made this stage of the competition for the first time since 1979/80, when they were beaten 4-0 in a replay by Tottenham’s North London rivals Arsenal (first game was 0-0).
