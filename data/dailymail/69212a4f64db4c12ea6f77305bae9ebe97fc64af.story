By day, Laura Butler teaches A-level students psychology and dance. But by night, she embarks on her other career as full-figured lingerie model.

The 26-year-old blonde was plucked from obscurity in 2009 after winning underwear firm Curvy Kate's first ever 'Star in a Bra' competition and after finishing her day educating students, she strips off to her to to reveal her shapely curves.

And outgoing Laura, from Kingshurst, West Midlands, isn't embarrassed about her second career and says all her friends, family and pupils are behind her.

Let's hear it for the curves: Laura is proud of her womanly figure and likes to show it off whenever she can

She said: 'It was around this time 
five years ago that I began modelling for Curvy Kate. This was a few 
years previous to me wanting to be a teacher.

'I had never wanted to teach so never 
thought modelling would get in the way. Fortunately, it hasn't - despite
my students knowing.'

And now Laura is keen for other wannabe models to follow in her footsteps and is helping launch Birmingham's next Curvy Kate 'Star in a Bra' in a contest.

She said: 'I think people should enter
because everyone should do something extraordinary in their life and 
this ticks all the boxes. I should know as I have ticked them!

'I am not a shy girl, so confidence 
was never something I was lacking. But 'Star In A Bra' seemed to cement 
that confidence and it really shines through now in all I do.'

The annual competition to find full-figure models has proved a massive hit, with thousands applying each year.

Hannah Houston, marketing and PR 
manager for Curvy Kate - which offers D-K cup bras for more voluptuous 
women - said: 'We truly believe our customers should model our lingerie 
as these are the girls who will be buying it.

'Our model search is here to prove how gorgeous a shapely figure looks in lingerie.

'Every single one of the girls bring 
their own spark and personality to the brand and our customers can see 
exactly how our lingerie would look on a shape similar to theirs.'

But while it's worked out well for Laura, the same cannot be said for former Harrow School art teacher  Joanne Salley,  who learned a hard lesson when revealing photos of her taken by a colleague went viral on the internet.

She said the pictures were taken for a bit of fun but ended up almost ruining her life when they were published in 2011.
