A record number of Americans are currently living in multigenerational homes with their parents, grandparents or both - and it's millennials who are leading the trend.

According to a study released by the Pew Research Center today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently shares a home with older generations in their family, more than double the number in 1980.

What's more, for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than adults aged 85 and older.

Going back home: According to a study today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently share a home with older generations in their family

Researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data from 1940 to 2012 to reach their findings.

They found that the number of multigenerational homes jumped significantly during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009 because of obvious economic factors, but it has been steadily rising ever since.

While only 18.7per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds lived with their parents or grandparents in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, this figure has risen to 23.6per cent today.

In contrast, just 22.7per cent of adults ages 85 and older lived in a multigenerational household in 2012.

Back in 1980, only 11per cent of people in this age group lived in their childhood home.

Young people living with parents or grandparents may be another sign of delayed entry into adulthood, along with marrying later and staying in school longer, the Pew report said.

Among the younger generations, men were significantly more likely than women to be living with their parents, grandparents are both.

The researchers found that 26per cent of males between 25 and 34 lived in a multigenerational household in 2012, compared with 21per cent of females in the same age group.

Different backgrounds: Race, gender and economic factors also play a roll in the changing figures

Race and social factors have also played a roll in the growth of multigenerational homes; Pew reports that racial and ethnic minorities are generally more likely to live in such situation.

With an increase in the immigration population since the Seventies, the number of multigenerational home arrangements as increased as well.

Indeed, the research center reports that in 2012, one-in-four Hispanics and blacks and 27per cent of Asian Americans live in homes with their parents, grandparents or both.
