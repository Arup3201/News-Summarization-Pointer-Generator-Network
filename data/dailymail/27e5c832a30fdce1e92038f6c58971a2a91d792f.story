David Moyes has been offered a £4million a year deal to replace Roberto Mancini as Galatasaray's manager.

Moyes could be set for a swift return to management following his unsuccessful stint in charge of Manchester United which culminated in his dismissal in April – nine months after taking charge of the then champions.

The Scot is taking a tour of the Turkish capital and will fly back on Saturday. Preliminary talks between the two parties have left the Turkish side confident they have landed their man.

Despite finishing top of the Turkish Super Lig last season, Fenerbahce cannot compete in either the Champions League or Europa League in the coming campaign.

In July 2012, Uefa found the club guilty of match-fixing and banned them from competing in the European competitions for two seasons.

Turkish agent Muzzi Ozcan - who dealt 
with Mancini's move to Gala - is due to fly out from London to Istanbul 
on Friday night to help finalise the deal.

Galatasaray
 have confirmed a meeting with president Unal Aysal has taken place, but
 described the talks as merely an exchange of ideas and said that 
Joachim Low and Jurgen Klinsmann are their top targets.

'The president has given a speech about it,' a Galatasaray spokesperson said.

'He
 said that we just spoke with David Moyes and he said that he can come 
to Galatasaray but he is not one of the main targets for us.

'They just spoke to each other, exchanging ideas - that it is it. It is true the president talked with David Moyes.

'We are not in a rush, we are waiting for the end of the World Cup. The first two targets are Low or Klinsmann.'

Former
 Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini was sacked by the Turkish club 
earlier this month and now they are looking to the Glaswegian to fill 
the role.

Sportsmail 
understands the naturally cautious Moyes remains firmly undecided as to 
whether it is the right move for him but he knows a club with a rich 
European history certainly represents an interesting challenge.

The
 Scot is having discussions with Galatasaray chiefs and is giving 
serious consideration to making a move to Turkey as he looks to rebuild 
his reputation after the traumatic time he encountered at Old Trafford.

That said, he also knows his next job needs to be the right one after his brutal sacking at the Theatre of Dreams.

Moyes was fired from the Red Devils hotseat in April, with United languishing in 7th position.

Controvesial: Graeme Souness planted a Galatasaray flag in the centre of Fenerbahce's pitch in 1996

He
 is known to be keen to manage a team in European competition after 
enjoying his experience in the Champions League last season, with 
Galatasaray fitting the bill.

It would be the fourth club he has managed in his career, after spells with Preston and Everton previously.

Galatasaray,
 who finished second in their domestic league and won the Turkish Cup 
under Mancini, have previously been managed by a Scot in Graeme Souness.

Souness
 spent a year in charge of the Istanbul club from 1995-96 and earned 
infamy when he planted a Galatasaray flag in the centre circle at the 
ground of arch-rivals Fenerbahce.
