The Romanian tourist board plans to promote the alleged family ties between British royalty and the tyrant who inspired Dracula to entice more UK visitors to the country.

The Royal Family's ancestry has been linked to Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia, who earned the sobriquet 
Vlad the Impaler thanks to his penchant for having his victims spiked on huge metal stakes.

The Romanian National Tourist Office announced plans to use these 
royal links in promotional campaigns to lure curious Brits at a London trade fair which opened today.

The country has already welcomed 7 per
cent more Britons in the first three months of this year than in the 
same period last year, and as many as 118,000 visited in 2011.

In a 2011 documentary about the Carpathian mountains, Prince Charles made a reference to his ancestral links to 'Count Dracula'.

'The genealogy shows I am descended from Vlad the Impaler, so I do have a bit of a stake in the country,' he quipped.

It is believed Queen Mary, 
consort of George V - Charles' great grandfather - was related to the 15th Century slayer. 

What is certain is that George V's cousin Marie married the crown prince of
Romania and went on to rule the eastern European country after the 
First World War.

Vlad the Impaler, who inspired Bram Stokers Dracula, is tied to Britain's royal family both genealogically and through a medical condition that gives sufferers a thirst for blood.

It is believed that Queen Mary, consort of George V, was related to the 15th Century slayer Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Vlad is said to have dispatched more than 100,000 Turkish warriors in battle. The vampire legend was fed by his predilection for eating bread dipped in his victim's blood.And it is known that porphyria, an iron deficiency, which is thought to lie behind the vampire myth and may have spurred Vlad's taste for blood, has run in the Royal Family.

Vlad the Impaler was notorious for his bloodthirsty campaigns against
the Ottomans and fierce repression of his people.

The total number of his victims is estimated in the tens of thousands.

His reputation for cruelty is said to have helped inspire Bram Stoker's diabolical villain, Count Dracula.
