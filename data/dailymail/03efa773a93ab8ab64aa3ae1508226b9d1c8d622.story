Cigarette smoke lingering on the surfaces in the home are posing a serious health risk to babies and toddlers.

Cancer Council Queensland released new research on Saturday showing third-hand smoke clinging on to furniture, carpets, walls and children's toys could cause cancer.

Third-hand smoke occurs when more than 4,000 chemicals in second-hand smoke reacts to indoor air, remaining on surfaces months after a smoker has lit up.

Cancer Council Queensland has found second-hand smoke that reacts with indoor air, dubbed third-hand smoke, is posing a health risk to children

The council's spokeswoman Katie Clift said the threat of third-hand smoke was proven and parents needed to be proactive in making their homes smoke-free.

She said the smoke was damaging human DNA, which could potentially cause cancer.

'Chemicals from second-hand smoke stick to curtains, dust, clothing, toys and floors – and can remain in a home as third-hand smoke on surfaces for months after active smoking occurs,' she said.

'Babies and toddlers are at high risk from crawling, putting hands and toys into their mouths and potentially swallowing or inhaling compounds from third-hand smoke.

Parents are urged to keep their homes smoke-free for their children who come in contact with the surfaces where third-hand smoke clings to

'Third-hand smoke can be found in cars, units and homes – anywhere that smoking takes place in an enclosed space, and can even stick to the hair and skin of smokers.'

Tobacco-related diseases claim the lives of 15,000 Australians a year despite it being the leading preventable cause of death.
