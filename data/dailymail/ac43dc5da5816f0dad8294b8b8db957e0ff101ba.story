Sorry dad: Francesca Eastwood, pictured, has revealed that President Barack Obama will win her support when she heads to the polling booth on November 6

Clint Eastwood's empty-chair speech at the Republican National Convention may have swung a few voters but the act didn't convince his own daughter to vote for Mitt Romney.

Francesca Eastwood has revealed that President Barack Obama will win her support when she heads to the polling booth on November 6.

'I happen to not be voting for the same man,' she said of her dad as she left the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood. 'But I love that he stands up for what he believes in.'

TMZ quizzed the 19-year-old on whether she had the same political leanings as her legendary movie star and director father.

Eastwood is a vocal Republican and used his prime time speaking slot at the conservative conference to interrogate an empty chair, that was supposed to be Obama.

The address started an internet craze known as 'Eastwooding' where thousands of pictures of people pointing at all sorts of empty chairs were uploaded on the internet.

The peculiar speech was criticised for overshadowing the Republican presidential candidate's own speech, but Eastwood defended his performance.

'If somebody's dumb enough to ask me to go to a political convention and say something, they're gonna have to take what they get,' Eastwood said in an interview with Extra.

'People loved it or hated it and thatâ€™s fine,' he added. 'That's what it was supposed to be.'

But President Obama was unfazed by 
Eastwood's act and even tweeted a picture of himself sitting in his 
leather chair that is embossed with his title.

'He
is a great actor, and an even better director,' Obama told USA Today at
the time. 'I think the last few movies that he's made have been 
terrific.'

Meanwhile, another Hollywood director is doing his bit to help Obama stay in the White House.

Steven Spielberg has donated $1 million to the President's campaign on September 24 and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg handed over the same, according to Deadline Hollywood.

The pair are among the largest donors to camp Obama and hosted a private meeting with the President and former President Bill Clinton at Katzenberg's home on October 7.

The meeting also included 11 other deep-pocket donors to Obama's re-election campaign.
