It will be the 16th time the Queen has visited Australia, though some protests are expected

Pro-republic protesters are believed to be secretly planning to disrupt the Queen's visit to Australia after she arrives in the country tomorrow for a 10-day visit.

She and the Duke of Edinburgh will be given a ceremonial welcome after touching down in the capital, Canberra, at sunset - symbolic timing for what, at the age of 85, might be her last tour Down Under.

And while protesters in Melbourne are expected to demonstrate against her 16th visit, all the protest flags and shouts of 'Go Home' will be nothing new to her - she has smiled gracefully whenever anti-royalists have tried to make their voices heard.

Coming quickly to the Queen's defence, Mr Matthew Archer, an official with the Australian Monarchist League, said last night any protest would be immature.

'They don't need to take to the streets - we already know that some are opposed to the Monarchy so what will they gain by telling us over and over again?' he asked.

Anti-Monarchists are in the majority when it comes to support for Australia continuing its links with the Monarchy - despite dinner-table talk suggestions that the country wants to go it alone, opinion polls reveal that support for a republic has been waning.

A poll conducted earlier this year among 1,200 people showed that interest in forming a republic has dropped to a 17-year low of 41 per cent, down from 45 per cent in 2007.

The popularity of Prince William and his wife is also expected to provide a boost to continued links with the Monarchy.

The Queen, who has had a 57-year love affair with Australia, is still well liked and the 90-year-old Duke is regarded as a jolly fellow whose witty - and sometimes foot-in-the-mouth - comments add a light presence to formal occasions.

A military band will play and hundreds of school children will be on hand to greet the royal couple when they touch down in Canberra.

And it will be a time for fond memories - even if some are second hand.

Hugh McDonald-Crowley, who has been chosen by his school to greet the Queen at Canberra airport recalled that his mother was aged three when she saw the Queen.

'My mum told me she almost kicked the Queen in the shins because mum was so small - and my Great Uncle Peter met the Queen because he used to be the Governor of New South Wales, so he's had the Queen stay with him,' he said.

The Queen and the Duke will cross a nearby lake aboard a barge that some have described as looking something like a classic vintage cruiser from a James Bond movie.

A new collectable $5 coin has been struck by the Mint to celebrate the Queen's tour, which includes visits to Brisbane, where she will meet victims of this year's floods, and trips to Melbourne and Perth.

A flower show, boat trips, a ride in a tram and an Aussie barbecue are among the events planned for the royal couple.
