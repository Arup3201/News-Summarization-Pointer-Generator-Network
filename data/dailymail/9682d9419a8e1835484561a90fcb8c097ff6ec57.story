A teenager has spoken of her misery after her puppy was shot by police officers who claimed they were unable to restrain it during a raid.

Shannon-Marie Henery, 17, had left the dog, Blaze, at a house when she moved into temporary accommodation where her pet was not allowed to live.

Weeks later the dog was killed after a specialist response unit raided the house in New Addington, near Croydon, South London, searching for a teenage male suspected of burglary.

Blaze was staying at another house away from Shannon-Marie in New Addington, near Croydon, when he was killed

When they were unable to control the animal during the raid on Tuesday, officers from the Metropolitan Police called in armed back-up.

Shannon-Marie said: ‘I can’t believe the police have shot my puppy. He was a playful, loving puppy. He was my world.

‘The only time he showed aggression was if someone knocks at the door or he hears a loud noise and he barks because he protects his home.’

She said that her pet died ‘for no good reason’.

‘This is wrong, I’m taking things further,’ she said. ‘There was no dead bodies, weapons, drugs in the house.’

Shannon-Marie said the French mastiff and pit bull terrier cross was her best friend from the day she got him, at just nine weeks old.

She said: ‘I suffer badly from anxiety, and I got Blaze to help me cope. I felt safe when I took him out. He was my hero and my best friend.

‘I can’t believe that he’s gone. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. I want answers, what they did has to be answered for.’

Blaze was at another house because the college student is temporarily staying with a relative while she tries to find somewhere permanent.

She added: ‘Blaze isn’t vicious at all. If the police said he barked at them, I’m not surprised. I’m sure any dog would bark if police burst into their house.

‘They can’t bring my dog back, but I need to know what happened, and why they couldn’t have just left him alone.

‘Blaze was my friend and now I’ll never see him again.’

She said there was ‘no need’ for the shooting and vowed to find out why it was carried out. ‘Someone needs to pay for this. How could they shoot my defenceless puppy?’

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: ‘Officers attended an address in Windham Avenue, New Addington, on January 23 to carry out an arrest enquiry for a 17-year-old boy wanted in connection with aggravated burglary and robbery offences.

‘Police forced entry to the address and the 17-year-old suspect was located and arrested at the scene and he currently remains in police custody at a South London police station. A dog was also present at the address, and was acting aggressively towards officers.

‘A specialist police dog unit attended, but were unable to safely restrain the dog. Armed officers were subsequently called and the dog was shot and killed. We believe the dog may be pit bull-type breed.’
