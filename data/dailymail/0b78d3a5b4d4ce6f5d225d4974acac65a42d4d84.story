Murderers and rapists in Ian Brady’s psychiatric hospital are able to watch gory violent horror films and hardcore porn, it emerged last night.

Ashworth Hospital in Maghull, near Liverpool, offers patients a range of DVDs including The Silence of the Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, Hostel 1 and 2, Deliverance, Saw V and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Reservoir Dogs features a scene where a man’s ear is cut off, and characters in Saw V are decapitated, crushed and cut in half. The two Hostel films feature gruesome depictions of horrendous violence and have been called 'torture porn'.

The disturbing films are available to the patients, many of whom have committed sickening crimes, from the library which holds 750 films.

The Government pledged to ban prison inmates from watching X-rated films earlier this year, but the new rules do not apply to dangerous patients and criminals held in secure psychiatric units, who are not termed as prisoners..

The patients in Ashworth Hospital are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, and there are fears that viewing violent or sexual films could make them more likely to commit depraved acts.

Silence of the Lambs, featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins as psychopath Dr Hannibal Lecter, is one of the films available to patients

Hostel: Part II features sadistic torture scenes and violent sexual themes

A spokesman for Merseycare, the body which runs Ashworth Hospital, told the Daily Mirror: ‘The hospital library, situated on site, has more than 750 DVDs and the certificate rating is not recorded centrally, or in a way that is easily accessible.

‘All the DVDs in the hospital library are checked and vetted by security staff before allowing a patient access to them. Each patient’s request is considered individually by the security care team, in line with the NHS Safety and Security Directions 2011, which govern national arrangements in high-secure psychiatric hospitals.

‘If any request from a patient causes concern for the security team it would be referred to the patient’s clinical care team.’

Ian Brady, who killed five children with his accomplice Myra Hindley, was sentenced to life in 1966 and has been held in Ashworth Hospital since 1985.

Other Ashworth inmates have included Mark Corner, who murdered two women after being released from a psychiatric unit in 2003 and Paul Corrigan, who kidnapped, raped and murdered 13-year-old John Haddon in the West Midlands.

Bill Esterson, the local labour MP, called on the Government to make rules surrounding DVDs the same for inmates and patients in hospitals like Ashworth.He said: 'The Government recently decided that X-rated DVDs are not available for prisoners and it makes sense that patients at Ashworth who have committed very serious offences should face the same restrictions. Ashworth is a hospital so the NHS is responsible.'
