Accused: Timothy Henson allegedly shot dead his mother-in-law's husband and ex-husband on Sunday

A alleged gunman is facing a murder charge after shooting dead his mother-in-law's 19-year-old husband as well as her 70-year-old ex-husband, it was reported today.

Timothy Henson kidnapped his mother-in-law and own wife on Sunday evening after a family dispute following a beach trip near Bandon, Oregon.

After an argument in a Chevy Blazer, it is alleged that Henson, 43, fired up to three shots, hitting his wife, mother-in-laws husband and her ex-partner.

George Micheaux III, 19, died at the scene, while Milton Chester Leach, 70, who was shot outside the vehicle, was removed from life support on Monday.

It was reported today that the alleged double killing unfolded after the relatives had spent a day visiting beaches before traveling on Highway 101 south on Bandon.

Henson allegedly fired one to three shots inside the vehicle, with a bullet hitting his wife, Vallena Tuell, 30, in the forearm.

Henson was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon on charges of aggravated murder, assault and kidnapping

The family lived together in Myrtle Creek, near Interstate 5 about 90 miles east of the crime scene.

Henson and his wife lived in the house, the Micheauxs have a trailer on the property and Leach, the ex-husband of Ruth Sherrie Micheaux, stayed in the garage.

The group of five are said to have stayed in a motel on Saturday night before heading to the beach on Sunday.

Coos County district attorney R. Paul Frasier said Leach had terminal lung cancer, and the weekend getaway was a chance for him to enjoy the coast for perhaps a final time.

Tuell was treated at a local hospital for her forearm injury and released.

It's unclear when Leach and Ruth Micheaux, 47, got divorced. Micheaux and her teenage husband were married in New Mexico in November 2009.
