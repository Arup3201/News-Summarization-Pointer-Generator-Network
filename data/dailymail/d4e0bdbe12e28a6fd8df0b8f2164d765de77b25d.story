A teenager who admitted burgling an astonishing 278 homes was told yesterday that his offending was ‘off the Richter scale’.

Adam Crampton, 19, was already serving a four-year sentence for robbery and burglary when he decided to ‘clear the slate’ by confessing to all his crimes.

He took police officers on four separate tours to point out properties he had raided. There were 200 in one area of Leicester alone.

Serial criminal: Adam Crampton burgled 278 homes and stole 60 cars in Leicestershire and Rutland

At the city’s crown court, he was given an additional five years on top of his current sentence.

Judge Simon Hammond said the number of burglaries Crampton had carried out was ‘off the Richter scale’ when it came to sentencing guidelines, adding: ‘What I am presented with here is a huge number of burglaries. For many people, their homes are never the same again. The effects never leave them.

‘You were a persistent and remorseless burglar. Life is about choices and responsibilities. This can only be dealt with by way of a substantial custodial sentence.’

James Varley, defending, said that Crampton, of no fixed address, had a difficult upbringing, was led astray when he was 12, and had trouble with cannabis and cocaine.

The court heard that during his tours with police officers, Crampton described his ‘modus operandi’, and ‘demonstrated intimate knowledge of the buildings involved’.

Ben Gow, prosecuting, said: ‘The police were able to compare this with the actual offence reported.

‘They had no other evidence other than his admissions.

‘There was no DNA left, or fingerprints, and so on.’

Confessed to crimes: Crampton revealed the full extent of his criminal history in interviews with police, even taking them on tours and pointing out homes he targeted

Crampton admitted three specimen counts of burglary and asked for hundreds of others to be considered as well as the theft of 60 vehicles, mostly mopeds, during the raids between 2005 and 2011.

One of his victims, 60-year-old  Sylvia Hammond, told of her relief  at finally discovering the identity of her intruder. Crampton stole a laptop computer, a phone and a digital camera from Mrs Hammond’s home in Oakham, Rutland, in July 2007.

She said: ‘It did cause great upset at the time.

‘If he is only 19 now he must have been very young then, only a child.

‘But it’s comforting to know who did it and also that the police have never given up even after all these years. You hear that a lot of people in prison go back to their old ways when they are released.

‘I just hope he doesn’t, now that he has admitted all of  these crimes.’

Detective Inspector Simon Cure, who led the investigation, said: ‘Today’s result is a great success for the victims, who now know who committed the crimes against them.’
