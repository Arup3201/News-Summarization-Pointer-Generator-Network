His stellar career made the beautiful game look like child's play - and that's exactly what David Beckham has been indulging in since he retired.

The former England football captain has spoken again about his love of Lego, revealing the children's toy 'calms him down'.

He told the Sunday Times Magazine he loved making Lego creations with his children and even bought a £210 model of London's iconic Tower Bridge.

'The last big thing I made was Tower Bridge,' he told the magazine. 'It had about 1,000 pieces. I think Lego sometimes helps to calm me down.'

The Tower Bridge model costs £210 and is more than 3ft long, including more than 80 windows, a black taxi to drive across and a drawbridge which opens and closes.

But the price was small fry compared to the value of one of the football legend's previous purchases - a Lego Taj Mahal.

The 5,900-piece kit is no longer sold by Lego and has become a collector's item, commanding a second-hand price on Amazon of £1,300. One model is on sale for more than £2,900.

But despite its value, Beckham never finished building the marble mausoleum.

Revealing his love of the toy bricks in 2010, he told a Q&A by search engine Yahoo: 'It's going to make me sound really weird but when I was in Milan I had such a big amount of time on my hands that I found online that there's a Taj Mahal Lego that you can buy.

Career highlights: Beckham enjoys Lego so much that a film of his life was made using plastic bricks

'So I bought it and started building it when I was in Milan.

'I only built some of it because I got injured halfway through... not building the Lego!

'I know it's not a career but I love doing it. My boys are the same - they're obsessed with building Lego.'

The former England captain's love of Lego is well-documented - and his career highlights were even immortalised in plastic blocks last year by Japanese filmmakers Mori Pictures.

In today's magazine interview, Beckham gave an account of his average day in his new family home in Kensington, west London.

He only spends five minutes getting ready for the day, he revealed, and likes going to his local pubs for a pint because 'the people there know me'. He also relaxes by cooking or drinking a glass of red wine.
