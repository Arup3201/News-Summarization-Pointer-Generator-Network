For a campaign called Made For Mischief, wild child Cara Delevingne was an obvious choice.

The supermodel, 21, returns as the face of Pepe Jeans for AW14 alongside two handsome male models as the trio fool around and cause havoc in various settings.

In one shot Cara is pictured lounging in a bath sandwiched between fellow models Claude Simonon, son of Clash guitarist Paul Simonon, and Italian Paolo Anchisi. In another, the hunks try to cram tiny Cara into a bin.

The ultimate and brilliantly mischievous British party girl and the boys hits the streets clad in the London-born brand's latest distressed boots and denim.

Cara gets playful dressed in light knits, skinny jeans, short denim and leather skirts, plaid tops and leather jackets.

Pepe Jeans say they tapped into their mantra 'Life is about having fun' for the raw and edgy new campaign, returning to the brand's roots.

Cara, Claude and Paolo are depicted having fun, being young and free-spirited, provocative and gently rebellious.

Spot them climbing over walls, carrying each other and messing around.

Photographed by Mario Sorrenti and styled by Charlotte Stockdale, the campaign is all about one's own individual style; the beauty of being natural.
