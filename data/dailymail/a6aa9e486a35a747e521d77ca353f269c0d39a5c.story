The thug who beat a good Samaritan so savagely his own mother thought he was dead was on a court-ordered curfew at the time - but was not wearing his G4S tag.

Brian Ramsay, 25, had been fitted with the electronic tag for previous offences and should have been indoors when he carried out the brutal attack on 18-year-old Angus Gallacher. 

He had been placed on the restriction of liberty order and ordered to stay home between 9pm and 6am. 

He was due to have the tag removed on October 26 - the same day he battered the teenager to a pulp.

'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher, who spent a week in hospital (pictured). 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was "I should protect myself as much as I can"... I have no recollection after that'

Ramsay cut off the tag himself. Police sources say when he was arrested there was no sign of the tag – and no information to indicate he should have had one. 

Security firm G4S are supposed to alert the court if any tagged offenders appear to breach a curfew or remove their tag.

Police are then supposed to take action against the offender. 

It is understand that G4S said they immediately informed the court when Ramsay removed the tag and told him to hand it to a local police station.

Last night, Conservative chief whip John Lamont told the Daily Record: 'Electronic tagging has its place but there have always been suspicions that it was delivered purely to help empty overcrowded pisons.

'Given that he had previously removed his tag, prison is exactly where Brian Ramsay should have been.'

He added: 'It only adds insult to injury to know that his sentence was a mere 18 months.

'Our justice system let Brian Ramsay out on to the streets, it failed to punish him for removing his tag and then when he committed this barbaric attack, it jailed him for less than two years.

'It is shameful.'

The attack happened when Ramsay was walking home from a night out with friends in Gorebridge on October 26 and spotted Mr Gallacher lying on his back in a petrol station forecourt. 

The young mechanic helped him to his feet, took him to a shop to get some food and then helped him across the road - but then Ramsay unexpectedly turned on him.

He subjected Angus to a brutal and sustained assault in the street before dragging him to a nearby house where he attacked him again.

Shocked neighbours heard the attack and called police, who found the  teenager lying unconscious in the street.

He had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his right eye after the  assault. 

'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher. 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was "I should protect myself as much as I can".

'He must have realised what he had done because he dragged me to his house to get me cleaned up. Then he hit me again in the garden and I have no recollection after that.'

The teenager spent a week in hospital, where doctors discovered he had suffered such bad damage to his right eye that he had to have a titanium plate implanted behind his eyebrow.

The youngest of three boys, he woke up in a hospital bed disorientated and disfigured.

Ramsay was sentenced to just 18 months' jail last week for the brutal attack - and he could be freed in just six.  

Mr Gallacher's family attacked Ramsay's sentence describing it as 'disgusting' and called for better treatment of victims.

Mrs Gallacher said: 'My husband and I are totally shocked and think it's disgusting.

'I don't know the definition of a long time but 18 months doesn't seem to be very long. It's not justice. He was only helping someone and this was his reward.'

When police came to their door in the middle of the night, Mrs Gallacher said she thought her son was dead.

She added: 'When we were taken to the resuscitation unit where Angus was, my husband couldn't walk through the door.

'He just gripped my arm and said "My God, what have they done to my boy". I couldn't recognise him.

'His head was about five times the size it should have been. He was covered in blood.

'The police photographer who came along said she had never seen such damage before in her life.

'That's why we are so upset with what we heard in court.' 

A petition has been launched calling on the Scottish Government to intervene in the case.

It asks that the Government step in to ask the Crown Office to reconsider the charge against Ramsay and upgrade it to attempted murder. 

A Scottish Courts Service confirmed Ramsay was on a restriction of liberty order when he launched the savage attack on Angus.
