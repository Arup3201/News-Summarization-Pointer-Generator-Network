A thieving care worker is facing jail after she pulled three rings worth £2,250 off a vulnerable 88-year-old woman's wedding finger before selling them for £54.

Sally Murphy, 38, took advantage of the patient, who suffers from severe dementia, at a residential home in Greater Manchester.

She was caught after she stole the woman's wedding, engagement and eternity rings and then took them to a pawn shop in Wythenshawe.

Two weeks earlier, Murphy had stolen 
her own mother's £150 eternity ring while she was in hospital suffering from
a suspected heart attack. She sold it for £10.

Murphy, 38, bowed her head at Manchester Magistrates' Court as chairman of the Bench Scott Cowap said: 'To take advantage of people like this is a despicable and disgusting crime.

'This was a high-level breach of trust.'

But the magistrates rejected a prosecution claim that it had been a 'form of disability hate crime'.

The court heard Murphy had been employed at Marion Lauder House in Wythenshawe, a residential and respite centre.

On October 7, the daughter-in-law of the 88-year-old victim noticed that the three rings had disappeared from her wedding finger.

A week later, it was discovered that Murphy had sold the rings, including her mother's, at a shop in Wythenshawe for £54.

Helen Veitch, prosecuting, said Murphy had initially claimed her mother had given her the ring.

But when detectives visited her mother in hospital she said her daughter was lying and had never been given the eternity ring or permission to sell it.

Murphy, who lives with her mother in Wythenshawe, admitted two counts of theft in September and October. She is due to be sentenced at the crown court on December 7.

Regarding the dementia victim, Mrs Veitch said she hadn't been in a position to protect herself.

She said: 'She was easy pickings.'

Tom Stephenson, defending, described the thefts as 'opportunist' and said they had been triggered by Murphy getting into substantial debt while on sick leave successfully battling cancer.

He said: 'It was inexcusable behaviour but she had also stopped taking her medication which may have had some bearing on what she did.'
