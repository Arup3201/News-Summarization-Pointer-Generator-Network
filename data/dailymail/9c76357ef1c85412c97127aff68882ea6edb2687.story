Jellyfish are thriving as ocean temperatures and acidity levels rise.

And while this might sound like good news, gluts of the slimy creatures near coastlines can clog nuclear power plants and sting swimmers, damaging the tourism industry.

To combat the problem and create something useful at the same time, a start-up in Israel is making an absorbent material from dead jellyfish called Hydromash.

Clever solution: To solve the problem of blooms of jellyfish littering beaches and blocking pipes, a start-up in Israel is making an absorbent material from dead jellyfish that could be used to make nappies and napkins

Hydromash is a new material made from jellyfish that could be used to create absorbent products like napkins and nappies.

It claims to be dry, flexible and strong as well as more absorbent than most types of paper towels.

Hydromash can hold several times its weight in water and unlike polymers used in nappies at the moment, is fully biodegradable.

The material can break down in just 30 days.

It is so absorbent because of the structure of jellyfish's bodies, which can absorb and hold high volumes of liquid without disintegrating or dissolving.

The material was developed by researchers at Tel Aviv University.

The company claims that the ‘dry, flexible, strong material’ is more absorbent than most types of paper towels and could be made into napkins, napkins and medical sponges, The Times of Israel reported.

Hydromash can hold several times its weight in water and unlike polymers used in nappies at the moment, are fully biodegradable, breaking down in around one month.

The material is so absorbent because of the structure of the jellyfish’s bodies.

Ofer Du-Nour, president of Cine’al – the company behind the invention - explained: ‘Jellyfish are marine creatures composed of 90 per cent water and that live in water.

Helping clean up: The president of the company behind the jellyfish material believes it could clean up landfills (pictured) and oceans at the same time. If Hydromash is used in nappies alone, the potential environmental benefits could be huge as the materials used in them are not biodegradable

‘Their bodies are formed from material that can absorb high volume of liquids and hold them without disintegrating or dissolving.’

The product is based on research by Tel Aviv University, where scientists set out to find a biodegradable material as absorbent as synthetic materials such as super absorbing polymers (SAP).

Once they had identified jellyfish bodies as a suitable material, the researchers used nano materials - which have special properties because of their size - to convert the jellyfish into Hydromash that can absorb large volumes liquid in seconds.

They added nano particles, which means the material can be engineered to be antibacterial, extra flexible, colourful or even scented.

Mr Du-Nour said that Hydromash is safe and could clean up landfills and oceans at the same time.

If Hydromash is used in nappies alone, the potential environmental benefits could be huge, as a single baby is thought to get though 155lbs (70kg) of nappies in its first year alone, which are made of synthetic materials that are not biodegradable.

A useless pest? Jellyfish (pictured) have littered Israeli beaches and coastlines of other countries in recent years, with millions of the gelatinous creatures shooting poison into the water, which prevents locals and tourists swimming

Mr Du-Nour said: ‘There are too many jellyfish in the sea, and too many Pampers in landfills. Cine'al may have the ultimate answer to both those issues.’

He is not concerned about people being put off by the origin of the new material because he thinks consumers take little notice of the constitution of many products with ingredients that come from animals and plants.

Jellyfish have littered Israeli beaches and coastlines of other countries in recent years, with millions of the gelatinous creatures shooting poison into the water, which prevents locals and tourists swimming.

They are often viewed as dangerous pests with only a handful of species being eaten in the Far East, while a chemical called mucin can be extracted from jellyfish and used in drug delivery systems.
