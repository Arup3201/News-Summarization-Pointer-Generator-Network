Basingstoke claim to have been in contact with Ronaldinho's brother, Roberto De Assis, who also acts as the player's agent.

Simon Hood, Basingstoke Town's marketing director, said: 'Discussions have been had, and there is an offer on the table. Now it is up to Ronaldinho to decide whether he wants to take us up on it.

'He is on a free transfer and if he wants to get into English football, I cannot think of a better way to do that than by signing for Basingstoke Town.'
