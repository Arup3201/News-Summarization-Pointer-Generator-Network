Subjects like hairdressing will no longer count towards a school's league table results

More than 3,000 discredited vocational courses will be downgraded because pupils are shunning tough subjects, Michael Gove declared yesterday.

Schools will be barred from using ‘dead-end’ qualifications – including courses in ‘personal effectiveness’, fish husbandry and nail technology services – to count towards their league table rankings.

Youngsters will instead be encouraged to gain at least a C in English and maths and study science and a language.

The Education Secretary warned against pandering to the view that school is ‘like the movies or a club’ where pupils expect to find lessons ‘exciting’ – and drop out if they are too difficult.

‘If we say that we will tolerate or accept non-attendance on the basis that school is too hard then we are condemning children to a future where, at every stage they face a challenge, we make excuses rather than encouraging them to do better, and that way lies perdition,’ Mr Gove told the Commons education select committee.

‘It’s unacceptable that people are bristling at the requirement that we have children doing English, mathematics and science to an acceptable level.’

Michael Gove said changes to education would take time but would benefit children

Under a GCSE ‘equivalence’ system 
introduced by Labour, schools were allowed to count more than 3,000 
vocational courses towards their league table position.

The courses were deemed equivalent to 
one or more GCSEs and given league table points in an attempt to 
motivate disaffected pupils. One approved course was a Level 2 
Certificate of Personal Effectiveness, which taught children how to 
claim the dole.

A report commissioned by the Coalition
 found that many of the qualifications were ‘effectively dead-end’ with 
no use in the job market. Its author, Professor Alison Wolf, of King’s 
College London, said schools had been entering pupils for the courses 
just to amass league table points.

Mr Gove announced yesterday that only 
125 out of 3,175 vocational qualifications for 14 to 16-year-olds meet 
new criteria for inclusion in league tables.

Of these only 75 will count towards 
the main yardstick of secondary school performance – the percentage of 
pupils achieving five A* to C grades including English and maths. And 
they will count as only one GCSE.

The number of courses that will matter is to be cut from 3,000 down to just 70

Schools will still be able to enter 
pupils for the qualifications, but from 2014 they will no longer count 
toward their league table rankings. Many are expected to wither on the 
vine.

Former education secretary David 
Blunkett said: ‘By all means slim them down but do not send the message 
that this is a wholesale trashing of what was there and that vocational 
education has been downgraded.’

** Exam boards are touting their courses
 as ‘easier’ than rivals to win business from schools, a former director
 general for education standards said yesterday.

Jon Coles spoke as publisher Pearson, 
which owns the Edexcel board, called for A-levels and GCSEs to be 
toughened to boost public confidence. Pupils could in future answer a 
common core of questions regardless of which board had set the paper, it
 said.
