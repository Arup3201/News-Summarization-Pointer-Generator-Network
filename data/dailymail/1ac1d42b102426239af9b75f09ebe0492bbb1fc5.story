Arsene Wenger's decision to name three reserve forwards in the Champions League simply gave his boo boys another reason to hurl abuse.

Criticism of the Arsenal manager has reached fever pitch over the last few weeks, but nobody can fault the way he went about his business in Istanbul. Arsenal were truly rampant, and at the heart of it was Lukas Podolski.

That the German forward is classed as a back-up is nonsense, and that he might be heading for the exit door at Arsenal is simply ridiculous. He's the best finisher Wenger has at his disposal.

Lukas Podolski scored twice on an impressive night for Arsenal in their final Champions League group game

Arsenal had already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League, and so Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck were left to watch the game from home.

Up stepped Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell, and the aforementioned Podolski with a chance to prove their worth at the highest level. 

And it didn't take long for the latter to strike gold. Whether he was seeking to impress his current manager or a prospective, future boss is unclear, but Podolski was certainly proving a point.

With three minutes gone, the German rifled the ball home to put the Gunners 1-0 up, with the same boot that put Anderlecht to the sword in October.

The German has now scored in each of his last four Champions League appearances.

On 20 minutes, Podolski struck the bar, and eight minutes later he could have had a hat-trick when Sinan Bolat tipped his powerful shot into the side netting.

Campbell and Sanogo came together midway through the first half too, when the former slotted the ball through to his teammate, before the attack was thwarted.

In the dying moments, Podolski added to his tally when he drove into the box and slotted calmly past Bolat. Left foot, right foot. All he was missing was a header for the perfect night. 

Aaron Ramsey took the plaudits on an impressive evening for Arsenal, when he scored a goal that Paul Merson described as 'the best I've seen in all my years.'

But Arsenal couldn't have done it without Podolski. Whether he has a future at the Emirates is as yet unclear, but if Wenger makes the decision to oust the forward, there will be a queue snaking around the London Colney car park of managers seeking his signature.

Podolski is quite simply a natural-born finisher... and they don't come around all that often.
