A 12 year old New Zealand boy who is losing his sight wants to fill a 'visual bucket list' before he goes blind.

Louis Corbett, who together with two of his older brothers suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary condition that robs sufferers of their sight, sometimes within months, is in a race against time to experience some of the world’s wonders before it’s too late.

His parents, Catherine and Tim, asked him what he would like to see most – and the brave boy came up with a heart-warming hit list.

Boy on a mission: Louis Corbett wants to complete his bucket list before he goes blind

Louis, from Auckland, chose the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and, in a sign of the times, Google headquarters in California.

And unlike most Kiwis, who have a passion for either rugby or cricket, he also said he wanted to watch a live Boston Celtics basketball game in the US.

'Last year was a hard one for poor Louis,' Mrs Corbett told CNN. 'That's when he learned that his case was accelerated.

'(But) this year we're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can.

'For some reason he really got hooked on American basketball. He cares about nothing else. He is really quite passionate about it.'

In control: Louis's list has involved him travelling to the United States

With Louis' eyesight fading rapidly - by 50% in the past year alone - the trip was going to have to happen soon.

A Boston-based businessman heard of the family’s plight and moved to make the little boy’s dream come true.

Warren Casey, CEO of a US-based software firm, made a large donation and vowed to raise even more so Louis and his family could be in Boston for the Celtic’s game against the Golden State Warriors on March 5.

'I did it because the Corbetts are my next door neighbours,' said Mr Casey, who splits his time between Boston and his home in Auckland.

He persuaded Air New Zealand to pay for the airfare and donated his own points. Thanks to the generosity of Mr Casey and his partners at Ceiba Solutions, who agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised, and the generosity of people around the world, more than $25,000 was raised in just four weeks.

'It is so touching,' Mrs Corbett said. 'People are just so supportive.'

The fund-raising campaign also came to the attention of Corinne Grousbeck, wife of Celtics CEO Wycliffe 'Wyc' Grousbeck, whose 21-year-old son suffers from a similar condition to Louis’.

'Somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in New Zealand and told me I should read it,' said Mrs Grousbeck, incoming chairwoman of the Perkins School for the Blind.

'I completely understood where the Corbetts were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for (Louis). It's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through.

'Of course when I read about how he was a big Celtics fan, I knew that we had to have him come for a game.”

While Mrs Grousbeck said she would ensure Louis and his family get some of the best seats in the house, she said the real show would be before tipoff, when the Perkins chorus sings the US national anthem.

'I think for a 12-year-old like Louis, for him to be able to watch visually impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage, for him to see what blind people can achieve, that's going to give him the lasting memory,' she said.
