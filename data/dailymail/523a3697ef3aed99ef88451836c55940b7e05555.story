It could be the perfect service for Instagram addicts, giving you 20 free prints of your favourite pictures each month.

The catch - there will be an ad on the back of each one.

However, app firm Flag hopes enough people will like the idea to help it raise $100,000 on Kickstarter.

Flag is a phone and tablet app that prints your photos for free and mails them to you, your family or friends, for free.

Similar to photo sites like Instagram, Flag will allow customers to edit their pictures before printing.

The firm also said it will users a variety of filters and virtual frames that can be printed on their pictures.

Users can create postcards, and can even create one giant picture cut into a 20 piece puzzle.

The app, still in beta, lets you select up to 20 pictures every month to be printed at 4-by-6-inches and sent to you.

'You canâ€™t hang an iPad on a wall, you canâ€™t mail an iPhone in a birthday card, and not every friend and relative uses the same social networks you do,' the firm said.

'That's why we love to print photos.

'Unfortunately printing is expensive, often of poor quality, and not as flexible or fun as finishing photos with apps and filters.

Postcards can also be created using the system - although will also feature an ad

'Flag is an app for iPhone that will change that.'

The app will also have a unique 3D mode that shows a thumbnail gallery, but allows the user to tilt their phone to 'look around' pictures.

'Our secret to making photo printing free? An advertisement on the back of each print,' the firm says.

'It will always be tasteful, and we are steadfast in our commitment to never sell or share your personal information with advertisers.'
