Wearing the striped caps designed to turn them from human beings into numbers, these Holocaust survivors wept as they returned to a concentration camp after 69 years.

The three Polish men were among those remembering 76,000 people who died at two sites in central Germany - hanged, starved or riddled with disease, mostly for the crime of being different.

They were forced to make munitions at Mittelbau-Dora, where the ceremony took place, and 50 miles away at its parent camp Buchenwald, both of which were liberated by U.S. troops 69 years ago this week.

As early as 1937, Nazi leaders sent some 250,000 people to Buchenwald, Mittelbau-Dora and dozens of other sub-camps, where they lived in terrible conditions with little food.

The majority of those who died collapsed from exhaustion. At Buchenwald, 8,000 Soviet prisoners of war were shot in a specially-made killing facility.

This year's ceremony focused on the genocide of Hungarian Jews in the Second World War, and saw the former prisoners lay flowers and examine the crematorium where the bodies of their friends were burned.

After lying forgotten in disrepair for decades, Mittelbau-Dora, near Nordhausen, Germany, was reinstated in 2005 as a memorial site and museum to the atrocities of Nazi Germany, with the message that they should never be forgotten.

Tears for the dead: Nazi concentration camp survivor Boleslaw Pieniazkiewicz, from Poland, mourns during a ceremony today to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the liberation of former Nazi concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora near Nordhausen, Germany. Around 20,000 prisoners died in the camp

Memorial: From left, Polish survivors Alojzy Maciak, Boleslaw Pieniazkiewicz and Tadeusz Samerdak lay flowers at Mittelbau-Dora today. The site is now a memorial

Memorial: The three survivors of the camps walk to view the crematorium wearing prisoners' hats. This year's commemoration focused on Hungarian Jews

Emotion: The prisoners at Mittelbau-Dora and its parent camp, Buchenwald, were forced to make German munitions for the war in terrible conditions

Shadows of the past: The camp was stripped bare in 1947 and reinstated as a full memorial site in 2005, to ensure the horrors of the Nazi regime are not forgotten

Comfort: Bertrand Herz, President of the International Committee of Buchenwald-Dora and Sub-Camps, left, with Nazi concentration camp survivor Ed Carter-Edwards, who travelled to the service from Canada. Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and the homeless were sent to the camps, among many others

Poignant: With their prisoner numbers still visible to remind them how they were dehumanised, the survivors examine tributes at the new memorial in Mittelbau-Dora

Horror: Nazi concentration camp survivor Chasten Bowen and his wife Jeanie Bowen travelled from California. Here they examine the ovens where bodies were burned

Liberated: Elie Wiesel, right, was one of thousands found emaciated when Buchenwald was liberated by the allies. The site was 50 miles from sister camp Mittelbau-Dora

Freedom for those who lived: Inmates of the Buchenwald camp line up receive treatment at an American hospital after the camp was liberated by U.S. troops in April 1945
