Father: Misty Upham's father recently spoke out saying that he fears his daughter is suicidal

A Washington actress is still missing  one week after her disappearance and her family fears she is suicidal, officials say.

Misty Upham, 32, was last seen near her Auburn home Oct. 5. Police responded to a suicide call at Upham's apartment, People magazine reports, but when they arrived, Upham was not there  and officers were not able to contact her.

However, this is not the first time Upham has reportedly left her apartment without notice and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at Upham's apartment. People reports that, in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. 

Upham's father, Charles Upham, said in a statement that Upham has a 'medical condition,' but neither he nor Upham's mother have revealed what the condition is.

Upham's father recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he fears his daughter is suicidal. 

'She had recently changed her medication, so she was sort of having erratic behavior,' Upham's father told THR. 'She told me and her mom that we didn't have to worry about her any more. … I thought it sounded suicidal myself, so I called the police. 

'She's always been a suicidal person.'

Upham's father went on to say that Upham sometimes made suicide threats, but 'never went through with it.'

Phone Call: Upham's father recently revealed the last conversation he had with his daughter where she said that he and her mother didn't 'have to worry about her anymore'

'Missing person': The police did not comply to Upham's father's request to have his daughter listed as a 'missing person.'

People reports that Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her disappearance. A source reportedly told people that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent.

One day after Upham went missing, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.'

The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today.  

Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. 

In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. 

We are asking for help from people who live in the area to search the wooded areas near the Muckleshoot casino.' The post stated that the police are not looking for Upham.

Another post revealed that Upham's family has no income.

'[The] father is recovering from a recent stroke and is disabled.,' the post reads, '...mother is disabled with congestive heart failure...the family is dependent on donations.

The family wrote in the post that they are 'doing everything within our means to bring our daughter home safe.'

Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.'   Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.
