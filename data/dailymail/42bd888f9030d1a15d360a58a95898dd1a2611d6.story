The magniloquent wrath of North Korea rained down on a group of 'scum' defectors today after they published a report claiming copies of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' were handed to its officials as a leadership guide.

The defectors claimed in the report that leader Kim Jong-un had handed out copies of the Nazi dictator's manifesto to top officials for inspiration.

An unnamed source in China who claims to have seen the defectors' report said the book had been translated and handed out to officials in Pyongyang at the time of Kim's birthday in January.

News has emerged from highly secretive North Korea that its leader, Kim Jong Un, has distributed copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf to senior officials to see what they can draw from it

'Mentioning that Hitler managed to 
rebuild Germany in a short time following its defeat in World War 1, Kim
Jong-un issued an order for the Third Reich to be studied in depth and 
asked that practical applications be drawn from it,' said the source.

The source added that Kim had told his
generals that sports had played a key role in cementing unity and 
spreading Nazi ideology in Germany and he had called for policies to 
encourage sporting activities among North Koreans.

Pyongyang was furious, describing the defector's report as a 'thrice-cursed crime' which was aimed at belittling Kim.

Officials threatened to kill the 'human scum' behind the report.

Mein Kampf, published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926 offers a mixture of Hitler's autobiography with his political ideology.

In it the Nazi leader spoke of the 'Jewish peril', an alleged conspiracy by members of the religious and ethnic group to seize control of the world.

He also says Germany needed to seize new territories to the east as 'Lebensraum' (living space) to properly nurture the 'historic destiny' of the German people.

During Hitler's years in power, the book was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front until, by the end of the war, around 10million copies of the book had been circulated in Germany.

Owing to its overtly racist content, and the historical consequences of the ideologies it promoted, it remains a hugely controversial volume, banned in some countries. 

'We are determined to take substantial
measures to physically remove despicable human scum who are committing 
treasons,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

'Sordid human scum will never be able 
to look up to the sky, nor be able to find an inch of land to be buried 
after their death.'

Kim's men also vowed to launch 
'merciless punishment of justice' against Seoul and Washington, capitals
which were accused of encouraging defectors to defame the North Korean 
leader.

The controversial distribution of Mein Kampf was uncovered by New Focus International, a North Korean-focused news organisation working to get news out of the highly secretive country.

The infamous Nazi tome was distributed in a limited edition, called 'a one-hundred copy book' in North Korea, which is published in secret for the country's top officials to read.

The source behind the revelations said: 'Kim Jong Un gave a lecture to high-ranking officials, stressing that we must pursue the policy of Byungjin (which translates to the word 'tandem') in terms of nuclear and economic development.

'Mentioning that Hitler managed to rebuild Germany in a short time following its defeat in World War One, Kim Jong Un issued an order for the Third Reich to be studied in depth and asked that practical applications be drawn from it.'

The threat to eliminate 'scum' so they will not be able to have an inch of land to be buried in was not made lightly.

A general who had shown disobedience last year was lined up against a wall and blown to pieces by a mortar shell.

Hitler's memoir, which translates as 
My Struggle, was written in 1924 while he was being held in a prison in 
Bavaria before he became Germany's leader.

In it he strikes out against Jews who he said were conspiring to gain world leadership.

Kim Jong-un toured North Korea's east coast last month in a 95-foot luxury yacht, a boat that could be prohibited under U.N. sanctions, a website that tracks events in the reclusive state said.

The NK News website said the yacht, a Princess 95MY made by British-based Princess Yachts, was possibly a recent purchase by the leader of the impoverished pariah state.

North Korea's KCNA news agency released a photograph of Kim on May 28 that showed him walking along a dock with henchmen. The starboard side of a luxury boat is visible to the right of the picture.

Will Green, sales director for Princess Yachts International, told NK News it suspected the boat was a 95MY.

'Given we launched the 95MY some years ago, many of them will have since changed hands on the private brokerage market,' said Mr Green, adding the company was looking into the matter.

Princess Yachts is part of LVMH, the world's top luxury group by sales. An updated version of the 95MY, the Princess 98MY, sells for more than $8.7million (£5.6million), NK News said.

New sanctions imposed in March in response to fresh nuclear tests included examples of luxury items North Korea could not import, such as yachts and racing cars.

Measures aimed at crimping the lifestyle of the elite were first imposed in 2006 but until now they had never given examples of such goods, leaving it up to individual countries to decide what constituted a luxury product.
