This is the hilarious moment a squirrel appeared to be sawing his friend in half - just like the famous magic trick.

With the second squirrel tucked inside a small wooden box marked 'The Great Squirrelisimo', our hero laid his tiny hands on a saw that had been carefully placed on the lid, leaving the pair inadvertently recreating a scene familiar to magic lovers around the world.

Max Ellis, 51, took the photograph in his garden in Teddington, London, after spending several days setting up the scene to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver.

Mr Ellis said he came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube in December.

He said: 'My son is very keen on magic so I thought it might be fun to see if I could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick.'

'It did take quite a while to set up as I wanted it to look realistic. I thought The Great Squirrelisimo was a nice stage name.'

Mr Ellis said the squirrels spent only a few minutes exploring the box, making the task of getting the perfect photograph much more difficult than it looks.

Patience: Mr Ellis spend several days waiting for the squirrels to arrive and explore his box

He also said the squirrels were continually jumping around and chasing each other, leaving them both in exactly the right spot at exactly the right time for only a fraction of a second.

He said: 'It took even longer for them to get into the position I wanted as they are obviously wild animals - they needed a few takes.'

'In the end I was trying for two or three days but it was worth the wait...I got the shot I wanted for my son,' he added.

After spending several days trying to 
capture the perfect shot, finally doing so proved something of a relief for
 Mr Ellis - not least because a heavy rainstorm hours later reduced the 
box to small pieces.
