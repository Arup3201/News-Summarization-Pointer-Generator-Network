She may be 94, but Elsie Corner from Manchester can still play a mean game of Words With Friends on her iPad - and claims the Apple gadget has changed her life.

Mrs Corner, who lives in sheltered housing close to Manchester Airport, admits to playing up to 16 games of the hugely popular puzzle game at a time, and also uses her iPad to track planes that fly overhead, and explore the world with Google Earth.

'It's been a wonderful way to keep in touch with my family,' she said.

Mrs Corner also uses her iPad to explore the world in Google Earth, and to track planes flying overhead using a flight Tracker app

'I use it nearly all the hours of daylight, 2-3Â  hours in the morning, then again in the afternoon.

'I live near the airport, so I love being able to look at the Flight tracker and see where the planes that fly overhead are going.

'I also really like Words With Friends, and have 16 games going at the moment.

Corner was a carpet weaver when she left school, and also taught painting.

She did own a laptop, but struggled with it.

'She had a laptop before, but the problem was she couldn't see the cursor, and she also has shaky hands so struggled with the mouse,' said her 63 year old daughter, Jean Holt, from Clitheroe.

'I was in America visiting my daughter, and I had a play with an iPad and decided to buy her one.

Words with Friends is 94 year old Elsie's favourite app

94 year old Elsie Corner admits to using her iPad for several hours a day, playing games and keeping in touch with her family.

Her favourite apps include:

'The great thing can enlarge all the writing to half an inch tall, so she can easily read.'

Mrs Holt loaded the iPad with apps gradually so her mother could learn how to use them - but found she quickly became an addict.

'She uses it several hours a day, and is determined to keep up with everything new, so she reads the news, does email, and uses Facetime to video call us all.

'We have family in America and France, and its been amazing for keeping in touch - we all have iPads now.

'Mum is extremely bright and willing to learn, she has a mobile but it's too small for her now, so she uses the iPad instead

'She says it is the best thing she has ever owned - It keeps her in touch with her family and she says it keeps her brain active.'

Elsie Corner, 94, uses her iPad to keep in touch with family members around the world, and is also addicted to the puzzle game words with friends
