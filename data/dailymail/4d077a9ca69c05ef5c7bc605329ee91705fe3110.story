A Playboy model caused a stir by sharing images of her curvaceous behind with her fans only to be caught in a Photoshopping row.

Peruvian beauty Tilsa Lozano, 32, uploaded a series of seductive snaps - that she insisted were raw, unretouched images - to Twitter in December to show her ex-boyfriend exactly what he was missing.

But she was left red-faced after a magazine editor claimed that the images had been tampered with and published several 'un-doctored' images of the model's behind - revealing cellulite on her bottom and thighs - to prove it.

These allegedly un-doctored images of Playboy model Tilsa Lozano were published by a magazine. Tilsa has responded by saying she is proud of her cellulite

Tilsa posted a message online aimed at her ex, footballer Juan Vargas telling him that love was about more than just looks.

She then followed this up with sexy swimwear shots in which she posed in thong and heels, showing off her curvy bottom to best advantage.

The model is justly proud of her bottom having been crowned Miss Playboy TV Latin America in 2008. 

She insisted the pictures were taken behind the scenes of a calendar shoot and were 'raw' images and hadn't been edited. 

But she was forced to defend herself when  Magaly Medina, 51, the editor of Magaly TeVe magazine, disputed this and revealed unflattering shots of the model's bottom, that showed the tell-tale signs of orange peel skin.

Playboy model Tilsa Lozano wanted to show ex-boyfriend Juan Vargas there was more to her than just her looks so shared this 'raw' image of her online with fans 

The pictures Magaly found are taken from behind of Tilsa wearing a tiny pair of denim hotpants worn with a tight white crop top.

It appears that Tilsa was snapped  at a show as she's seen dancing in one of the pictures.

Despite Magaly's 'proof' that Tilsa had edited her Twitter snaps, Tilsa denied that her bikini shots had been retouched and furthermore, added that she was proud of her cellulite, The Mirror reported.

In fact the row over the pictures prompted Tilsa to deny trying to deceive her Twitter fans about her natural figure and to reveal her pride about her natural physique.

The glamour model claimed  the images were unetouched but a Peruvian magazine, Magaly TeVe, disputed this and responded by publishing images it claims are un-doctored

She said: 'Yes, I do have cellulite, but that shouldn't come as a surprise as I haven't made a secret of it.'

The model followed the admission with several more 'belfies' which she posted online claiming that her cellulite was not as bad as Magaly had claimed.

In one particular heated moment the exchange between the two women became personal as the model reportedly compared the editor to Frankenstein, in a reference to the amount of cosmetic procedures that she is alleged to have had.

The model says none of her pictures have been airbushed  and claims  she has never tried to hide her cellulite

Tilsa (right) recently posted this photo of herself and a friend on her Twitter suggesting she has not been phased by her recent row with the magazine 

In one Tweet she said: 'I've just got out of a TV show with these clothes on. Frankenstein will be envious.'

The feud between the two women took place on Twitter with fans fighting the model's corner and responding to the dispute with montages of Tilsa's derriere.

The model continued her dismissal of critics by posting an image of herself with a friend holding a sign that reads 'I don't care what you think' on Saturday.
