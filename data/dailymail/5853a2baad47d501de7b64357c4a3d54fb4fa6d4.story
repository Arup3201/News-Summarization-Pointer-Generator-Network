A London state school where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language offers a better education than the private school attended by Princes William and Harry just around the corner, Michael Gove claimed today.

The Education Secretary vowed to ‘break down the Berlin wall’ between state and private schools to drive up standards.

And he claimed the Thomas Jones primary school in West London is now better than the £17,460-a-year Wertherby Prep-School which taught the heirs to the throne.

Thomas Jones Primary School in Notting Hill, West London, is regularly cited by politicians for its strong performance in a tough area

In speech to the London Academy of Excellence today, Mr Gove said the evidence shows ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’ that English state education is starting to show a ‘sustained and significant improvement’.

He said state schools could become the best in the world by tapping into the expertise of the independent sector.

But he went further in claiming that Wetherby school in particular may already have been overtaken by nearby state schools teaching much poorer pupils.

William and Harry both attended the prep school in Notting Hill in the 1980s before taking up places at Eton.

Other former Wetherby pupils include Downing Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, composer Lord Lloyd Webber and actor Hugh Grant.

Mr Gove said he wanted to make it impossible to tell if a school is private or state-run

Mr Gove insisted that the expensive and exclusive education on offer there was now matched by state schools ‘every bit as good as excellent private schools’.

He added: ‘There are state primary schools every bit as ambitious, as supportive, as exciting, as the smartest of private prep schools.

‘Like, for example, Thomas Jones primary in West London – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years, a majority coming from homes where English is not their first language – which is just as good, if not better, than the pre-eminent London prep - Wetherby school - just a mile or so away.

‘Under the changes we're making, it’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools.

‘Instead of reinforcing the Berlin Wall between state and private, as the current Labour leadership appear to want, we should break it down.’

Mr Gove was speaking at the London 
Academy of Excellence, a new free school in Newham, East London, which 
has managed to secure places in Oxford and Cambridge for six of its 
pupils – the same number achieved last year by Millfield, an independent
 school that charges annual fees of up to £32,385.

The Education Secretary also wants state schools to make pupils sit the ‘robust’ Common Entrance exam used by leading private schools and subject them to old-fashioned classroom discipline.

He suggests that all 13-year-olds should study for the 100-year-old test to indicate how well they are ‘performing against some of the top schools around the world’.

Mr Gove argues that it is wrong that between national curriculum tests at age 11 and GCSEs at 16, children have no formal, externally assessed examinations.

Founded in 1951, it was originally in upmarket Wetherby Place before moving to Pembridge Square in 1971. Former pupils include Prince William, Prince Harry, Hugh Grant, Lord Lloyd Webber.

Mr Gove wants state school pupils to take the exams used by private schools to drive up standards

He also urged head teachers to go further by adopting traditional methods of discipline.

New guidance being sent to schools today sets out suggested punishments for misbehaving students, including being sent for a run around a playing field, picking up litter or writing out hundreds of lines.

It also suggests that detentions can be issued at lunchtime, after school or weekends, with no notice for parents.

Mr Gove said that his ambition for the education system is ‘simple... when you visit a school in England, standards are so high all round that you should not be able to tell whether it’s in the state sector or a fee-paying independent’.

He argued that the state education system is ‘starting to show a sustained and significant improvement’.

But he warned schools must go further – setting out his proposal for 13-year-olds to sit the Common Entrance exam.

‘Privately educated children often benefit from rigorous testing of ability – and, crucially, knowledge – at regular points throughout their school career,’ Mr Gove said.

‘But since the last Labour government abolished tests for 14-year-olds, we have had no rigorous externally set and marked measures of progress for students in the first five years of secondary school.

‘It is often during this period that performance dips and students suffer.

‘I am open to arguments about how we can improve performance – and assessment – in this critical period.

'But there is already one widely available, robust and effective test of knowledge for just this age group: the Common Entrance test papers.

‘They are designed for 13-year-olds – they are used by private schools to ensure students are on track for later success – they are already available on the web, and are a fantastic resource.

‘So I want state schools to try out Common Entrance exams – giving them a chance to check how well they and their pupils are performing against some of the top schools around the world.’

There is, however, no suggestion that taking the Common Entrance test will provide a path into private schools.

On discipline, Mr Gove said every head in the state sector must have the ability to ensure children behave as ‘impeccably as in the most successful state and private schools’.

He added: ‘That means giving heads the power to ensure there is exemplary behaviour – and giving teachers the power to keep control in the classroom and the playground.

'Because without excellent behaviour, no child can learn – and a tiny minority of disruptive children can absorb almost all of teachers’ time and attention, in effect holding the education of the rest hostage.

‘So we have given teachers more freedoms to keep control in the classroom, and to discipline pupils for misbehaviour.

‘We trust the professionalism of our teachers. So we’ve given them the tools to keep control of their classrooms, and allow every student to learn in peace.’

Exams will test how pupils are getting along compared to other schools, and will not be used to give out places

The Department for Education said while current guidelines make clear the legal backing for setting school punishments, they fail to outline potential sanctions, leaving many heads and teachers unclear of what action they can take.

Mr Gove also suggested he wanted to see more state schools offer extra-curricular activities to extend the school day to fit in with the lives of working parents.

He said he did not support shorter holidays but said free schools and academies could vary term dates to allow parents to avoid the expense of holidaying during rigidly fixed half terms and other holidays.

Pupils should also be subjected to more old-style punishments

The tests would be to gauge progress, not to win entry to schools
