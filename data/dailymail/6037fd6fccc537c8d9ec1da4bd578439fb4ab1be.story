They are not like any burgers you've ever seen and you certainly won't find these bizarre buns at your local McDonald’s or Burger King.

The crazy creations are the brainchild of  artists Thomas Weil and Quentin Weisbuch, who were so bored of ubiquitous lunchtime sandwiches that they took matters into their own hands.

The duo soon established a ritual where they conducted weekly experiments on new ways of cooking burgers during their very short lunch break with the ultimate aim being to design an edible masterpiece of ‘everything that tastes good between two buns.’

The Beerger bun is made with malt, barley and hops. The patty  comes with onions, slices of orange, cabbage and cheese

The Mystery Box burger (left), created for Master Chef USA is composed of raw salmon, smoked bacon, mint, basil, garlic and yogurt sauce, rice cake, rice bun, black sesame seeds, salmon roe, mint and basil leaves and balsamic cream. The oyster burger (right) is made with sea rye bread, 'tsunami' butter, shallots, oysters, lemon drizzle, dill 'spray' and 'wrecked' wakame

Their wondrous creations, which feature everything from a gold-leaf covered burger and rolls stuffed with raw oysters, to 'burger' composed of rice and sushi, are featured on the duo's website Fat & Furious Burger.  

Thomas and Quentin – who founded the graphic design and art studio Furious – used the recipes to launch their Fat and Furious Burger cookbook late last year, with 60 recipes for ‘kamikaze livers and intrepid stomachs.’

The blurb on their website reads: ‘As we were so bored of random food at lunch, we started cooking together. It soon became kind of a ritual: improvising and experimenting new ways of cooking a burger in very short lunch break.

‘It’s about an hour and a half to find an idea, run to a supermarket to get everything, cook, shoot and eat. 

‘We didn’t expect this project to go viral: Back in 2012, we decided to launch our blog to show our crazy pics to our friend… never expecting it would be such a buzz!’

Crabzilla has spider crab, mango slices, curly lettuce, tomatoes, shrimp, lemon, fennel and chili mayonnaise

The Pizza Mutant Ninja Burger has tomatoes, bacon, lettuce, Cheddar, pepperoni, beef patty, mozzarella and salad 

The bun in the Ocean Burger was painted with food colouring to make it appear like salmon skin. The burger has smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions and mustard

The pair go on to explain that their project was born from the collision of two strong appetites. 

And while the burgers are not on any restaurant menu, the colleagues often work with chefs to come up with new creations.

The added: ‘We  cook them [the burgers] for our daily meals, so it’s all about one shot, but we often collaborate with restaurants to create special burgers people can actually taste.’

The Paris-based pair say it costs anything from 5 to 50 Euros to make their burgers.

Inspired by daily life, they also get burger ideas from newspaper headlines. 

When the twosome first started on their project they were shooting on their iPhones.

They have since graduated to their own studio with a proper kitchen and professional camera equipment. 

Understandably, with so many strange ingredients, the burgers are '‘sometimes a great surprise and sometimes kind of a fail.' 

The Head Burger: Mandolined tomatoes, vegetables, beef patty, sausage slice and white cabbage

In addition to a beef patty, the Apocalypse Now themed burger has pickles, onions, vinegar, nuts and a pomegranate reduction

The Hobbit Burger is made from a single bagel stuffed with  'Mordor' powder, peppers, onion rings, cod roe, hummus, cucumber and dill 

One of the pair's favourite burgers is the Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Burger that they created in collaboration with a restaurant in Geneva called Le Calamar.

They said: 'We were very excited to work on a global Burger event that included the creation of a delirium burger recipe.

'[It included] the creation of crazy posters and designs for the event’s communication, and above all creating a new food tasting experience.'

But their sushi-shaped burger has so far proved to be the most popular.

They said: ‘The sushi shaped burger we created in collaboration with tumblr & Master chef USA has been really appreciated by our community. 

[There were] more than 1500 reblogs on tumblr and thousands of likes on Instagram and Facebook.' 

It came from space: The UFO Burger with flying fish roe, tobiko wasabi, breaded chicken fillet, wakame salad, grilled papadum, beetroot sauce and slices of ginger and lemon
