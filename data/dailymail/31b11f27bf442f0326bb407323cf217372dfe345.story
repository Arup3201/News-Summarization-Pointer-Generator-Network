Convicted: Charles Masters, 34 (pictured) will spend 25 years behind bars for killing his brother Jordan Masters, 28, with a sword

A 34-year-old man who slayed his younger brother with a samurai sword before lying next to his dead body for four days hoping he would live again has been convicted.

Charles Masters will spend 25 years behind bars for the brutal murder of Jordan Masters in their Donelson, Tennessee, apartment on August 12, 2012.

The judge acknowledged Masters' 20-year-struggle with mental illness and his remorse but handed down the maximum sentence due to the crime's gruesomeness.

During Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Charles testified that he and Jordan, 28, trusted one another more than anyone else.

The 'best friends' shared an apartment at the Cedars at Elm Hill complex on Elm Hill Pike, passing the time by playing the Final Fantasy video game together and collecting swords.

But despite their alleged close bond, Charles pulled out one of the swords and slashed Jordan at least 16 times and partially severed his head after an altercation, according to WKRN-TV.

Charles lay next to his brother's decomposing body on the living room floor for about four days hoping he would come back to life before calling police.

'I wanted my brother back,' Charles said in court. 'I couldn’t accept the fact it was actual reality I was witnessing.'

Charles claimed in court he couldn't explain what happened on the night of the murder, describing the few seconds in which he attacked the 'worst 
mistake of my life', The Tennessean reported.

Charles' attorney, public defender Mike Engle, argued his client's history of severe mental illness should lessen the sentence.

However assistant District Attorney Katrin 
Miller pushed for the maximum sentence because of how Charles handled 
his brother’s body.

Charles, who was unemployed, slashed Jordan's body at least 16 times and allowed it to decompose.

Judge J. Randall Wyatt, Jr., reportedly said he'd never seen more gruesome images after looking at photos entered into evidence.

Family members said they were forced to hold a funeral with an empty casket because Jordan's body was so violated.

During the hearing, Charles' brother-in-law Jerry Whitney said Charles should have been Jordan’s 'keeper'.

'He was the oldest and bigger brother, and most time bigger brothers, they look out for their younger ones,' he said, according to The Tennessean.

'Watch over them. They’re supposed to protect them and keep their brother safe from harm and hurt. I feel Charlie had a choice to be his brother’s keeper, but he chose not to be.'

Jordan had worked at a local 
hotel and paid for the apartment where the brothers lived.

The mens' sister, India Whitney, did not ask for leniency for her surviving brother.

'I have not had my closure,' she said. 'I don’t ever want to see him again.'

Charles also did not ask for leniency, testifying that the ordeal had left him suicidal and that he should suffer the most severe 
possible penalty.
