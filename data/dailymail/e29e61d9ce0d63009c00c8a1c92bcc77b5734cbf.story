The Jamaican bobsled team are now headed to another Olympics after the Sochi Organizing Committee offered to cover the travel costs for the team.

Olympic organizers said Saturday that Jamaica has qualified for the two-man competition at next month's Games, and later announced that they will help meet some but not all of the team’s financial needs.

The team- which shot to popularity following the release of Cool Runnings, the 1993 film based on their story to make it from their tropical island nation to the slopes of the 1988 winter Olympics- is still trying to raise money to pay for the equipment they will need to compete.

Winston Watts, the sled driver, confirmed today that they are still raising money but has not said how much they need. On Saturday, he estimated they needed $80,000 but that included the cost of travel.

He said he has received calls from countless people around the world offering financial support.

For a nation lacking bobsled tradition, or snowy winters, Jamaica has often fared quite well on the international circuits.

Watts finishing 28th at the Salt Lake City Games 12 years ago, with Lascelles Brown — now a key part of Canada's national team.

Brown won a medal at the 2010 Vancouver 
Games, one where the Jamaicans were hoping to compete but were again 
thwarted by funding issues.

Jamaican Chef de Mission and four-time Olympic bobsleigh team member Nelson Stokes said: 'I can confirm that we have qualified a team for Sochi and it means a great deal that we are able to return to Olympic competition after a few years of missing out.'

'There is still great enthusiasm for bobsleigh in Jamaica and we are making great progress with our funding. We will definitely be in a position to take part in the Games.'

Making an impact: The 1988 triumph was captured in a 1993 Disney movie called Cool Runnings

The Jamaican team performed poorly at their second Olympics in 1992, but returned in 1994, 1998 and 2002.

Still, the 46-year-old Watts — who called himself 'retired' from sliding for nearly a decade — has held on to hope of sliding again on the sport's biggest stage.

'We're pretty good,' Watts said.

'We're not there with the rest of the world, of course. But we if had some more sources for funding, we'd have a better chance.'

He started the season thinking he could get a four-man sled ready for Sochi, before quickly realizing that was too expensive.

Changing it up: They only qualified for the 2-man race and not the 4-man sled as pictured here at a practice round in Calgary in November

Financial concerns: Winston Watt, the team captain, realized early on that he would not be able to get enough money together for a four man sled for the Sochi games

His focus then shifted to the two-man sled and by racing in a number of lower-tier events at tracks in Park City, Lake Placid and Calgary in recent months, Watts and brakeman Marvin Dixon piled up enough points to get into the Olympic mix.

Sochi officials tweeted word Saturday that the Jamaicans were in, but the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation — the sport's governing body — is not expected to confirm before Sunday at the earliest how many nations qualified for the Olympic fields.

Watts said he's confident that Jamaica is qualified.

'I'm not a person who likes to quit,' Watts said.

'I put my heart into it and I know for a fact that people are going to help this team.'
