A father in Colorado has won praise by local police after helping an officer take down a crazed gunman following a two-hour crime spree.

The incident occurred in broad day light on Wednesday on Interstate-70 near Lookout Mountain in Golden.

The suspect, Christopher Sullivan, 37, and his juvenile female passenger had been pulled over by police for a random record check, but fled the scene.

The pair then embarked on a case in which they stole three vehicles, burglarized two homes, menaced 12 bystanders and left at least six separate crime scenes in their wake.

ABC 7 Denver's helicopter captured part of the chase.

The female juvenile was eventually captured on a mountainside.

However Sullivan made it to the freeway and was pointing a rifle at passers-by, allegedly attempting to jack another car.

A Jefferson County sheriff's deputy came past on a motorcycle and immediately drew his gun.

'He was out right away with his handgun drawn yelling, 'Get down. Get down!' said John McLaughlin, who watched it all unfold from his Hyundai.

'The guy had his hands up and he said, 'Don't shoot. Don't shoot!'

The chase continued, and Sullivan ran toward McLaughlin's car.

He had thrown his weapon away moments earlier.

The manhunt for Sullivan (right) and his female 
accomplice (left) first began after an armed carjacking was reported
 on Lookout Mountain, west of Golden, Colorado, on Wednesday

The girl - who is underage - became separated from Sullivan and was arrested around 4.15pm. She is seen here with a police officer

Sullivan then entered this nearby home, stole an SUV and crashed it through the garage door

The suspect drove the SUV for a short time but ended up at a dead end. He fled the vehicle on foot

He was not successful and appeared to surrender, only to run again

The deputy then grabbed hold of Sullivan's shirt as McLaughlin watches the scene from his car (front left)

'I could've reached out and grabbed the guy, he was that close,' McLaughlin said.

As the deputy managed to grab Sullivan, McLaughlin figured he should help.

He could not see any other officers nearby.

'I was just concerned that he might be able to get up with just one officer on him so I thought, well I can assist and hold his legs down.'

Authorities said it was a crucial move that may have saved lives.

'[A deputy] said I wish there were more people out there that would respond to things like that like you did. So that was very rewarding and nice to hear,' McLaughlin said.

'One police officer said ... you could've saved a couple of lives.'

Sullivan is being held on a $1 million bond at the Jefferson County Jail and is facing 13 possible charges including criminal attempt first-degree murder of a police officer, aggravated robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft and criminal attempt first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, identity theft, theft and numerous warrants from previous crimes.

The juvenile female is being held at the Mount View Youth Detention Facility on charges of criminal attempt first-degree murder of a police officer, aggravated robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft and criminal attempt first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft.
