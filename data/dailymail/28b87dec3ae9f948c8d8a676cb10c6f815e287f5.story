A British plane passenger held up in an Ebola scare at a Las Vegas airport decided to tweet about the unfolding events as only the British know how - with a heavy dose of sarcasm.

Sasha Sabapathy, a social media manager at digital marketing company Deep Focus, was on the Delta flight travelling from New York's JFK to Las Vegas when stewards said two passengers from Africa had fallen ill this morning.  

Emergency services immediately quarantined the plane and its passengers, including the sharp-tongued former Bristol University student who took to Twitter to vent her frustration at the lack of information.

'Ok so Delta just told us the sick person just came from Africa. This is def (sic) an Ebola scare. No one will say Ebola tho (sic) it's like Voldermort', she tweeted. 

Chaos: Emergency services surround the Delta flight from New York's JFK that landed this morning at Las Vegas' McCarren Airport after a passenger from Africa complained of being ill 

Angry: Sasha Sabapathy, a social media manager and former Bristol University student, was on the flight at the time, and took her frustrations to Twitter 

After being in quarantine for a bit longer, she starts to get indications that the passengers do not have Ebola. 

As her impatience grows, she messages the Delta Airline assist page directly and asks if the passengers can have free alcohol. They reply saying: 'Sorry for all the trouble. Can you pls follow and DM your confirm number?' 

McCarran spokeswoman Christine Crews told My News 3 the flight was quarantined at the gate 'after reports that a passenger who had recently traveled in Africa vomited on board the aircraft.  

A spokesman for Delta Airlines told Fox News the passenger handed a flight attendant a note saying that person was not feeling well. Delta said the situation was not a 'communicable disease' event. 

Here are a selection of her tweets: 

Shocked: MissSabapathy starts her commentary with a reference to Harry Potter when Delta announces that two passengers are ill

Annoyed: She continues her online dialogue of events inside the plane, but begins to get indications that they may have Ebola 

Rant: In her third run of tweets, she criticizes the CDC for not reacting fast enough, and even messages Delta directly asking for free alcohol to 'numb the experience'

Firefighters, health officials and CDC officials responded and determined after a thorough assessment that the passenger did not meet the criteria for Ebola.

Last weekend, a sick passenger who landed at Newark was checked out for Ebola but turned out to be asymptomatic. 

The more than 200 passengers on board were initially held on the plane as medical personnel responded before they were allowed to leave. 

Yesterday, Hazmat teams rushed on to a plane from Philadelphia in the Dominican Republic after a man sneezed and yelled: 'I have Ebola!'

The American passenger, who does not have Ebola, was detained by four officers and taken to the airport's medical center in Punta Cana as he declared: 'I ain't from Africa'.

The remaining 255 people were forced to stay on board for two hours until he was cleared, despite airline staff insisting they believed it was a poor-taste joke. 

Fed up: Another frustrated passenger, Frank Esposito, also took to Twitter to show his frustration
