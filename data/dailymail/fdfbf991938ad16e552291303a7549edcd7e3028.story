An extinct fox that trod the ice-covered Himalayas five million years ago has been unearthed.

With its razor sharp teeth, Vulpes quizhudingi was a ferocious hunter and predated well-known Ice Age creatures such as woolly mammoths and sabre tooth cats.

The fox adds to a growing body of evidence that the mountains and nearby Tibet were ‘a cradle of evolution’ for mammals living in a cold climate that fanned out as the Ice Age gripped the planet.

The fox lived between 3.6 million and five million years ago at a time when the Arctic was a little warmer than Tibet.

Like modern arctic foxes, the ancient creature has long, sharp teeth for hunting.

Based upon the fossilised lower jawbone and teeth, unearthed between 2006 and 2012, Dr Xiaoming Wang, of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County believes the creature was as large as a big male modern fox, and around 20 per cent larger than a modern arctic fox.

The Tibetan fox, described in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, predates by three to four million years the previous oldest record of the arctic fox, whose geographical range is at least 1,240 miles (1,996km) away.

Tibet is known as the ‘third pole’ of the world. It includes Mount Everest and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, which is endowed with more frozen terrain than anywhere else on Earth except the North and South Poles.

Around three years ago, a woolly rhino fossil was found in the Zanda Basin on the north face of the Tibetan Plateau. It lived some 3.6 million years ago, long before similar beasts roamed northern Asia and Europe in the ice ages that gripped those regions.

Dr Wang said: ‘Such a model of megafauna coming down from high mountains to spread to the rest of the cold steppes in northern Eurasia and North America offer a scenario of the origin of cold adapted forms.

‘The apparent connection between an ancestral high elevation species and its modern polar descendant is consistent with our out of Tibet hypothesis postulating high altitude Tibet was a training ground for cold environment adaptations well before the start of the Ice Age.

‘In addition to the Tibetan fox, we have also discovered ancestors of snow leopard, hunting dog and running hyena, all of them highly predacious based on their teeth.’

The giants of the Ice Age such as woolly mammoths, rhinos, great sloths and sabre tooth cats, which arrived at least a million years later, have been intensively studied in recent years.

But much less is known about where the beasts came from and how they acquired their adaptations for living in the freezing cold.

Researchers believe the megafauna were descendants of the Pliocene era between 5.3 million and 2.6 million years ago after their ancestors used Tibet as a ‘training ground'.

Modern Arctic carnivores such as polar bear, grey wolves and arctic foxes are all highly predatory because of the large amount of energy required to live in such an extreme environment, which is all but devoid of plant food during the winter.

Dr Wang said that the Pliocene Tibet carnivore community would have also had the same appetite for meat millions of years ago.
