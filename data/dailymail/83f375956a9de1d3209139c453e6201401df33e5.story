The Doctor has landed outside Earl's Court London Underground station. 

His TARDIS has been spotted by hundreds of fans, thanks to Google's Street View.

And now anyone can take a peek inside by clicking the double arrow pointing at the old-fashioned police box located outside the Earl's Court Underground station on Google Maps.

For those not familiar with the Time Lord transportation, a TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) can take passengers to any point in time and space and to anywhere in the universe

For those not familiar with Time Lord transportation, a TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) can take passengers to any point in time and space.

Amazingly, the interior is much larger than its exterior, which looks like an old London police box.

The TARDIS is in some respects alive. It has a 'soul', which was once trapped inside the body of a woman, and will often redirect itself to where it thinks it needs to be.

It can blend in with its surroundings using a ‘chameleon circuit’.

The Doctor's TARDIS outside Earl's court station is broken and stuck in its current form. It can, however, turn invisible.

It also comes with handy tools. For instance, it can translate speech and writing for people travelling inside it, enabling them to understand any alien language even once they step outside.

Most TARDIS can use their chameleon circuit to change appearance. But, the Doctor- who was recently played by Matt Smith (pictured)- has a broken TARDIS which is stuck in the form of an old London police box

Unfortunately, Google only gives you a sneak peek of the inside the interior. 

You can see a maze of endless corridors, but the map doesn’t allow you to go down into the libraries, art galleries and swimming pools. 

A Google spokesperson said: 'Inspired by the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who, our engineers thought it would be a cool idea for users to find and tour the TARDIS from Street View level.'

So far fans have left 375 reviews of the venue.

‘Really neat place. Stayed here ages ago - always had a handy supply of jelly babies on the pillow,’ said one review.

‘They must have had a pest problem, though - I kept hearing someone shouting "Exterminate! Exterminate!”’

Another commented: ‘A lovely and spacious residence. The excursion trips are out of this world, literally.’

Google is known for adding semi-secret bonus features known as ‘Easter Eggs’.

For instance, typing ‘do a barrel roll’ into its search engine will see results spin around the screen.

Others features in the past have included putting ninjas in its Reader and spam recipes in its Gmail spam folders.

Last year, Greg Kumparak in California created his own DIY Tardis which was larger on the inside, thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality (AR).

He created it over a few hours using wood, two bottles and some dark blue paint, before fixing a working red light on the top.

'Then my stupid brain went and thought 'Hey wouldn't it be cool if it had an interior,' Mr Kumparak wrote on his blog.

But how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside?

First he created a 3D computer model of the interior using a free-to-use open source computer software programme called Blender.

The former Techcrunch mobile editor then used the Unity graphics rendering engine. Rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model stored in a scene file by using a computer program.

This information describes the geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting and shading of the virtual scene.

Finally he used an AR app platform by chip-maker Qualcomm called Vuforia, to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini Tardis.
