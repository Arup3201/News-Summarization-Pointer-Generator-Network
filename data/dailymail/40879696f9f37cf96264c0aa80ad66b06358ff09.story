Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany remains unflustered by Chelsea's early lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League.

Jose Mourinho's pacesetters are three points clear at the summit after six games and a further two ahead of a City side who are widely seen as their likeliest title challengers.

The only points that Chelsea have dropped thus far came in the 1-1 draw at City last month, suggesting the Blues are not likely to let their advantage slide easily, but Kompany knows there is plenty of mileage yet in the 2014/15 campaign.

He led the side that looked dead and buried in the title race three seasons ago, only to take the title on the final day, and also saw Arsenal drop off from a strong position last term.

'I can't really say that personally I'm looking too much at Chelsea,' said the Belgian.

'When we won the league first time (in 2012), we were nine points behind with six or seven games left to play.

'Last year Arsenal were leading by six or seven points and ahead of everyone in February but it ended up being between Liverpool and us.

'There are so many reasons why I'm not really focusing on getting back at Chelsea.'

City recorded their first league win in four at Hull last weekend and, far from obsessing over their rivals' start, Kompany is training his focus squarely on another away day at Aston Villa on Saturday.

'Away games in the Premier League are ever so difficult, so it was good for us to get a result (at Hull),' he said.

'There are no easy games ahead. The next game is at Aston Villa.

'Every fixture is a potential slip-up, but that's what's exciting about this league. I just look at the way we are playing and I just know we are going in the right direction. That's the most important thing for us.'
