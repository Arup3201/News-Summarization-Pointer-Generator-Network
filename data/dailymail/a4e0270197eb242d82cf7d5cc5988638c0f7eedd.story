‘I was just informed by the United States Senate legal counsel’s office that law enforcement agents are conducting a search of the personal residence of Ryan Loskarn, the chief of staff of my Washington, D.C., office regarding allegations involving child pornography,’ Mr Alexander said.

‘I am stunned, surprised and disappointed by what I have learned,’ he added.

‘Based on this information, I immediately placed Mr. Loskarn on administrative leave without pay. The office is fully cooperating with the investigation.’

Federal agents were seen searching the GOP aide’s house Wednesday morning, Politico reported.

Mr Loskarn was seen by many as a rising star in the Republican Party until these allegations were made public.

He was named to Roll Call’s 2009 ‘Fabulous Movers and Shakers’ on Capitol Hill, National Journal noted.

Prior to becoming Mr Alexander’s chief of staff in late 2011, he held various positions in the GOP across almost a decade on the Hill, reports said.
