It took 18 months to develop, costs an eye-watering £800 and has been dubbed the world's first Methuselah of beer.

And now the cheekily named Savour Everything In Moderation, the equivalent of eight wine bottles, has arrived in London. 

There are only six bottles of the rare Windsor-based specialist beer-makers Savour Beer in the world - and one is on sale at Sourced Market in St Pancras, London.

The six-litre bottle of sparkling beer was developed by Windsor brewers Savour Beer. There are only six bottles of the beer in the world and one of them has arrived at Sourced Market in St Pancras, London

The giant bottle was developed to raise the profile of the Champagne-style beer, which is brewed using 100 per cent floor malted British barley, hops and three yeast strains.

'I wanted to raise people's expectations and perceptions of beer; how it is packaged and how it can be consumed,' Sandy Kirkpatrick, Founder of Savour Beer told MailOnline Food. 

'The idea came from a trip to Belgium back in 2009, where I fell in love with the respect and passion people had for beer over there. 

Mr Kirkpatrick hopes the Methuselah will raise Britain's admiration for fine brews

'The Methuselah will hopefully raise Britain's admiration for fine brews.'

Rich and smooth with hints of caramel and honey on the palate, the 10.5 ABV beer is highly effervescent, with an intense finish and subtle spices on the nose.

'I played around with the name for awhile,' Mr Kirkpatrick said.

't's a little bit tongue-in-cheek. Everything in moderation, including moderation.' 

Ben O'Brien, Founder of Sourced Market said: We're really lucky to be the host of this extraordinary brew. 

'In terms of taste and how to consume, this beer will take British beer lovers' experience to the next level. 

'It's a mighty beer, and one lucky Briton will soon have the honour of sipping it with their friends

Sparking beer is made using the same method as sparkling wine or Champagne. 

After the initial fermentation, the beer is given a second fermentation in the bottle. 

The yeast is then removed from the bottle, leaving behind a clear, sparkling liquid,
