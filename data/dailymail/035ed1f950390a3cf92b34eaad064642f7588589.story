A three-year-old is giving the performers at Disney a run for their money thanks to an impressive wardrobe of homemade costumes designed for her by her mother using 'upcycled' old clothes and material.

Lane Rouch and her parents Jennifer and Chad, who are self-confessed 'Disnerds', visit one of the Orlando-based Disney parks once or twice a week in order to showcase the youngster's never-ending collection of Disney-inspired ensembles and have, unsurprisingly, become one of the most popular attractions at the tourist site.

Even the professional performers clamor to have their photo taken with the adorable toddler.

Jennifer, who is a longtime fan of all things Disney and even got engaged at a Christmas party at Disney World, began creating the costumes for her daughter after she and her husband decided to purchase unlimited annual passes to the park for the whole family.

And while the Rouch's well-dressed daughter managed to slip under the radar on her first few visits, it wasn't long before her unique outfits became the talk of the park. 

After dressing as Tarzan's Jane Porter for the park's 'Dapper Day', the young Disney fan was even invited to attend a special Beauty and the Beast-themed event where she was treated to a tea party with talking tea cup Chip, a story from the beautiful Belle and a dance with the Beast. 

But the highlight of the evening, mom Jennifer told the Huffington Post, was the standing ovation that Lane, who dressed up as Belle for the evening, received from her fellow guests as she and the Beast made their way through the Disney Castle restaurant.

'The music from the from the movie swelled up and the entire restaurant stood up and applauded our little girl, the beauty and the beast,' Jennifer recalled. 

In order to document their daughter's journey through Disney characters past and present, Lane's parents started an Instagram account, where they capture every one of the family's trips to the theme park.

Thus far, their account has amassed nearly 62,000 followers, including a number of staff members from the park.

Some of Lane's most popular costumes thus far include a remake of Cinderella's iconic ball gown, a glamorous green Tinkerbell dress - with matching wings - and a pink satin Little Bo Peep costume, complete with a miniature shepherd's crook.

And it's not just miniaturized replicas that Jennifer creates on her sewing machine. The crafty seamstress also designs a number of Disney-inspired dresses which often feature the faces of some of Lane's favorite characters, including Hercules, the Little Mermaid's Ariel and Jack Skellington from the Nightmare Before Christmas. 

'I learned how to sew when I was 18,' Jennifer wrote on her Instagram account. 'I was given a sewing machine and my boyfriend's dad (my father-in-law now) showed me how to use it. I'm mostly self taught though I credit working at a fabric store for most of my education in sewing...

'Eventually I started sewing for local costume shops and theaters and then professionally on my own a bit. I've been sewing now about 20 years.'

Super style: From Superman to Cinderella, the three-year-old has an outfit to match almost every Disney character

Smiles all round: The performers at the Orlando park have embraced every one of Lane's outfits

Life is the bubbles! Lane's parents are longtime Disney fans and are more than happy to indulge their daughter's love of the theme park

But of all the costumes that Lane has worn, it is The Princess and the Frog's Princess Tiana that holds the most memories for the family.

'[Princess Tiana] was the first princess at the parks that Lane went up to all by herself,' Jennifer said. 'And they shared a game of peek-a-bo that was truly magical...

'Now they have a thing for looking for wildlife and picking flowers in "the bayou".'
