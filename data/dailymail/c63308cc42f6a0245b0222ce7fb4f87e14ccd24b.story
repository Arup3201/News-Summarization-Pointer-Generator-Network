The Clintons are 'downsizing' their summer home to a simple, $18million house in the pretty Hamptons hamlet of Amagansett.

Former President Bill Clinton, 67, and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 66, are expected this week at the sprawling five-bedroom property, owned by Andre and Lois Nasser, which they have rented for the remainder of the month.

Their summer jaunt comes just weeks after Mrs Clinton controversially declared the power couple were 'dead broke' after leaving the White House in 2000.

Sources tell MailOnline they are paying $100,000 for their three-week stay - saving $100,000 from last year's luxury rental in Sagaponack.

Home owners: Wealthy art collector Andre Nasser and his wife Lois, a real estate advisor to the stars, have rented out their home to the Clintons

Mr Nasser, 67, a collector of primitive art, owned a gallery in New York, and is believed to have made his money with a number of clothing manufacturing plants. He is now said to be 'semi retired'.

Public records show that he is a Republican donor-  handing over $2,500 to Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign in 2012.

His wife, Lois, is a Senior Global Real Estate Advisor with Sothebys, and her clients are said to include 'celebrities and business leaders'.

The property - address 44 Broadview Road - is next door to movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is a noted Democrat supporter and longtime close friend of the Clintons.

It is situated on the top of a bluff, 200 feet up, overlooking Gardiners Bay and Gardiners Island in what's known as the Bell Estate.

Writer Blake Fleetwood, who lives nearby in Amagansett, told MailOnline today he had been told the news of the Clinton's impending arrival by neighbors.

However, when he asked Mr Nasser to comment, he could only say: 'I can't confirm or deny.'

Writing a blog for the Huffington Post, Mr Fleetwood noted: 'The owners of the home the Clintons are renting, like many other chic Hamptons veterans, are getting out of town for August and decamping to Tuscany for the month to escape the usual summer frenzy.'

Records show Mr Nasser bought the property in July 2002 for $2,750,000 - but of course, it is now worth significantly more, as Mr Fleetwood wrote it would sell 'for a lowly $18-or-so-million'.

He added: 'It's north of the highway and the railroad tracks  - the cheap side of town - which means it's on the bay instead of the ocean.'

What is clear is that Mr Nasser has been readying the property for visitors.

A source revealed: 'Andre was tearing his hair out as the internet went out a day ago, quickly followed by the thump pump - which takes the s**t to the sewer! He was rushing to get everything done in time.'

The Clintons busy schedule may not mean they can spend all their time grilling and embarking on Breaking Bad marathons.

As the New York Times reported, they plan to attend a fundraiser on Saturday to raise money for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, with tickets starting at $5,000 a person - and soaring up to $50,000 a couple for a seat at the head table and an invitation to the Clinton Foundation’s annual spring briefing in 2015.

The event will be held at the 6,100-square-foot shingled home in Water Mill, New York, owned by Joan and George Hornig.

Mrs Clinton, who has just finished an international book tour to promote her tome, Hard Choices, will also be at the bookshop Bookhampton on August
 16 to sign copies of the new memoir (fans will have to buy copies before being allowed in).

She came under fire while promoting 
her book in June after being pressed by ABC's Diane Sawyer on 
her reported haul of $5million in speaking fees alone.

She said: 'You have no reason to remember, but we 
came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.

'We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece 
together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's 
education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been 
amazing to me. He's worked very hard.'

According
 to financial disclosure forms, the Clintons had between $2.28 million 
to $10.6 million in debt in 2001, but Mrs Clinton went on to clarify her
 comments, saying: 'We have a life experience that is clearly different 
in very dramatic ways from many Americans, But we also have gone through
 some of the same challenges many people have.'

Sprawling: Bill and Hillary Clinton last year rented this $11million home in Sagaponack owned by Republican donor Michael Saperstein

Expensive: The Clintons shelled out $200,000 for their summer home last year

She went on to say she regretted the comments, saying: 'It was in-artful'. She told Fusion's Jorge Ramos; 'It was accurate but we are so successful and we're so blessed by the success we've had and my husband has worked incredibly hard.'

Today, President Clinton is in Kentucky to campaign for Alison Lundergan Grimes in the tight Kentucky U.S. Senate race.

While Mrs Clinton last night appeared on Stephen Colbert's Comedy Central show, where the pair enjoyed an unexpected name-dropping contest.

Last year, MailOnline told how the Clintons rented an $11 million Hamptons mansion owned by wealthy Republican donor Michael Saperstein for the month of August.

It a was a departure from the eight-bedroom house on Lily Pond Lane in  East Hampton owned by multi-millionaire Elie Hirshfeld, that they had rented for the two years beforehand..

As Clinton appeared on set for her surprise drop in, a 'shocked' Colbert excitedly said, 'Hillary Clinton!' 'Now who's a name-dropper, Stephen?' Clinton said

'Don't you dare!': 'You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers,' Colbert said as the audience ecstatically clapped for Clinton and cheered her name

It
 was claimed they did not return to the house - which was last year up 
for sale for $19.95million -  after receiving a small portion of their 
security deposit back because of higher than expected utility costs.

The summer break will allow the Clintons some much needed time for introspection.

Mrs Clinton is expected to decide whether she will run for President in 2016 by the end of the year

Today, the Mrs Clinton's spokesman 
confirmed she had moved her personal office to a Midtown Manhattan 
high-rise building - but denied it was the NOT a campaign office ahead 
of her potential Presidential run.

It is not yet known whether the Clintons daughter Chelsea, who is expecting her first child with husband Marc Mezvinsky, in the fall, will join them in Amagansett.

The Nassers did not reply when asked to comment, nor did the Clintons.
