Charles Saatchi had the means to prevent his ex-wife Nigella Lawson entering the US, her friends suggested in extraordinary claims revealed today.

The TV chef was stopped from boarding a flight at London Heathrow Airport on Sunday, apparently as a result of comments she made about taking drugs in evidence during an unrelated court case.

But now, astonishingly, it has been alleged that Mr Saatchi could have had the connections to deny her entry to the US - even if he did not use them - thanks to his family links to the Obama campaign.

Mr Saatchi, 70, has a connection to Matthew Barzun, who was appointed US Ambassador in London by President Barack Obama last year, reported Emily Smith of the New York Post’s Page Six.

Mr Barzun has been a Democratic party activist for many years - and the 43-year-old was an important fundraiser for the campaign to get Mr Obama elected in 2008, organising huge events.

Also involved in the Obama campaign as a manager was 29-year-old Edward Saatchi - Mr Saatchi’s Oxford-educated nephew, who founded the private social network NationalField.

A source told the New York Post: ‘We don’t know that Saatchi was behind this, but he certainly has the means and the contacts to do it.

‘Nigella’s friends cannot understand why she was specifically targeted, unless somebody, like her ex-husband, had tipped off the US authorities.’

At the trial of her and Mr Saatchi's personal assistants last year, the self-styled ‘domestic goddess’ admitted taking cocaine, and said her former husband was on a campaign to 'ruin me in any way'.

There is no evidence that Mr Saatchi in fact used his contacts to prevent Miss Lawson’s entry to the US, or that any of the named contacts would have been willing to help him with this.

The
 US embassy in London said yesterday that following Miss Lawson being 
prevented from flying to Los Angeles, she had now been invited to apply 
for a visa and promised the matter could be ‘handled routinely and 
expeditiously’.

During the 
trial last December, the mother-of-two told jurors she took the class A 
drug twice - once with her late husband John Diamond when he found out 
he had terminal cancer and again in 2010 when she claimed she was being 
‘subjected to intimate terrorism’ by Mr Saatchi.

BEFORE THE TRIAL

SAATCHI'I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so' (2013)

NIGELLA'I’ll go quiet when he explodes and then I am a nest of horrible festeringness' (2007)

DURING THE TRIAL

SAATCHI

'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be clear?'

‘I adore Nigella now. I absolutely adore Nigella and I’m broken-hearted to have lost her’

NIGELLA'He said to me if I didn't go back and clear his name he would destroy me... I felt his way of getting things out was to use this case'

'It comes after a long summer of bullying and abuse and I find it another chapter in that'

AFTER THE TRIAL

SAATCHI'The truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child when she was far too young to even smoke or drink'

NIGELLA'To have not only your private life, but distortions of your private life, put on display is mortifying'

'There are people going through an awful lot worse and to dwell on any of it would be self-pity'

But she told the court: ‘I have never been a drug addict. I've never been a habitual user.’

Miss
 Lawson, 54, had also said during the trial that she had endured 
bullying and abuse within her marriage, and believed Mr Saatchi was 
using the case to air grievances.

An eyewitness told the Mail 
that Miss Lawson attempted to board a British Airways flight from London
 on Sunday morning but was turned away.

‘She
 didn't seem to say much but she did not look happy,’ the onlooker said.
 ‘She could not get on the flight so she had to turn around and leave.’

Legal experts said Miss Lawson
 could have been unfortunate because her fame had drawn attention to what she said about drugs.

However, Miss Lawson has visited America since the sensational court appearance.

She appeared on US TV show Good Morning America to promote her show The Taste but also spoke at length about the trial of Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo.

The Grillos had been accused of fraudulently using company credit cards, spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on designer goods for themselves while working as personal assistants to the celebrity couple.

But the Italian sisters claimed every purchase had been approved by their then-bosses and they were found not guilty after jurors deliberated for nine hours.

Miss Lawson told ABC's Good Morning America that having details of her acrimonious split from millionaire art dealer Mr Saatchi discussed in court under the glare of the world's media was ‘mortifying’.

Comment requests were left today with Mr Saatchi’s spokesman and the US State Department.

Passage blocked: Nigella Lawson could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs

Lawyer Susan McFadden, who specialises in US immigration law, said Nigella Lawson could have been unlucky because her fame had drawn attention to the comments in court about drugs.

She explained: ‘In order to travel to the States without a visa on the visa waiver programme one has to obtain Esta (electronic system for travel authorisation) authorisation.

‘As part of that one has to answer questions about whether one has been arrested or convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or in relation to a controlled substance. Someone in Ms Lawson's circumstances could tick no.

‘But the problem comes when one also has to answer a question as to whether you are a drug abuser or addict. The question of who is a drug user is a difficult one and is supposed to be directed by regulations set out by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

‘Typically any person who has used drugs within the last year can be considered a drug abuser or addict. It could be because she is unlucky enough to be famous and her admission of drug use made the newspapers.

‘It could be that someone said “hey, if she has used illegal drugs in the past year she could be classed as a drug abuser”.’

Ms McFadden explained that if this was the case, there were a series of steps which must be taken before Miss Lawson would be allowed back into the States.

She would first be advised to visit a doctor who holds a contract with the US embassy in London who would carry out an assessment to see whether or not she could be classed under these terms.

If the doctor says she should be free to travel she could obtain a visa in a number of weeks, Ms McFadden said.

Police reviewed the allegations of drug use which emerged during the trial but Scotland Yard said no further action would be taken.

So while Miss Lawson has not been convicted for any drug offence, it appears that US officials still decided to deny her entrance to the country.

The US Department of Homeland Security told the Mail that foreigners who had admitted drug taking could be deemed ‘inadmissible’.
