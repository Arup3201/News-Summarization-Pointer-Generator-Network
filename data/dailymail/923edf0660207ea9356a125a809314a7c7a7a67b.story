BT Sport have delivered another blow to Sky’s long supremacy of subscription TV football by signing former  Manchester United and England midfielder Paul Scholes as a pundit on a four-year contract.

BT plan to make the most of Scholes joining their team by pitching him as the network’s answer to Gary Neville, his former team-mate for club and country, who has proved so successful on Sky.

But while Neville uses touch-screen technology to support his analysis, BT will rely on Scholes’ forthright views to attract viewers.

Scholes, who shunned the media during 
his stellar playing career, has emerged since retiring last year as a 
fearless critic on TV.

And in an online World Cup column for bookmakers Paddy Power, his views set the England news agenda.

Scholes
 said that Jack Wilshere had not improved since breaking into the 
Arsenal side and that Wayne Rooney was no longer an automatic choice for
 England.

It is a 
considerable coup for BT to attract Scholes as a regular analyst next 
season, especially as he made his recent reputation as a pundit on Sky.

In a separate deal, Scholes will be also be working for ITV on their Champions League coverage.

His
 BT debut is likely to be United’s opening Premier League game at home 
to Swansea on August 16 — manager Louis van Gaal’s first match in 
charge.

BT are understood to have made Scholes a lucrative offer, whereas Sky were only interested in using him occasionally.

But
 the chance of working on the Champions League, for which BT have all 
the live UK rights from the 2015-16 season — taking over from Sky and 
ITV — is said to be the main attraction for Scholes.

Will he stick the boot in? BT and ITV will hope Scholes is as combative in the studio as he was on the pitch

His
 arrival gives BT a formidable line-up alongside ambassadors  Rio 
Ferdinand, who impressed as a pundit for BBC during the World Cup, and 
Jose Mourinho, who will make a number of appearances as an analyst.

Grant
 Best, BT Sport’s senior executive producer, said: ‘Paul has proved 
himself to be a forthright and astute pundit since he hung up his boots.

‘His opinions have been every bit as tenacious as his tackling on the pitch.

‘It
 is fantastic that we have been able to sign up a legend like Paul to 
offer a unique insight based on a record of consistent success at the 
highest level of the game.’

ITV
 director of sport Niall Sloane said: ‘Paul brings his phenomenal 
expertise and insight to our team and we’re all looking forward to 
working with him.’
