A husband, his wife and her lover have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bestiality after they were caught using Craigslist to find a dog for the wife to have sex with.

Shane Walker, 38, and his wife Sarah Dae, 33, who describe themselves as swingers in an open marriage, were arrested in February after an undercover sting operation.

The couple, and her lover Robert Aucker, 26, were held after they drove out to a pre-arranged location to engage in the unnatural sex. Aucker was there to watch the bestiality and have sex with the couple.

The trio are scheduled to be sentenced on August 9.

The owner of the golden shepherd was an undercover detective, according toÂ Arizona Central.

The Walkers posted a Craigslist ad on
February 7 titled, 'Wife looking for K9', according to Maricopa County 
Superior Court records.

During a number of email exchanges 
between the couple and the detective, Dae offered sexual favors and they
agreed to meet at the Quality Inn in Mesa, which is where they were 
arrested.

Court records state that Dae, a 
photographer, admitted to detectives she told both her husband and 
Aucker she wanted a dog to have sex with her.

The trio had been hoping to meet the owner of a Golden Shepherd having spent three weeks corresponding with her over the use of the dog.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said:'People who do this for enjoyment are a different breed, that's for certain.'

Arpaio, who is known as the toughest sheriff in America over his stand against illegal immigration, said the Walkers had described themselves as 'swingers'.

According to the arrest report Aucker said he had been involved with Dae for a month and she had expressed her desire to have sex with a dog.

Last year Sheriff Arpaio wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster after the arrest of two people for using the website to solicit dogs for sex.

Arpaio asked for closer monitoring of the site, but said after the latest arrest: 'I remain extremely disappointed in the leadership at Craigslist.com for refusing to do what they can to stop this.

'While they aren't doing anything to stop it, I will continue to enforce all animal cruelty laws.'
