A father who planned to turn a dilapidated Texas house into a home for his family was left devastated when the property was mistakenly demolished.

Julio Soto arrived at the property in Dallas in August to find it had been demolished. It was torn down by city officials after they forgot to remove it from a list of eyesore homes to be flattened following its sale at auction. 

Mr Soto had only owned the property for three weeks and had just begun to improve its appearance.

Dallas City Hall has been demolishing vacant homes in an effort to clean up the community

He told CBS that he had plans to fix up the dilapidated home--now just a plot of land-- and make it a nice place for he and his family to live.

He told them, 'I need a bigger house because my kids are growing.'

Soto originally bough the house at a city of Dallas auction. The city completely forgot they sold the house to Soto and they forgot to remove the home from a list of vacant homes to be torn down.

Dallas city council member Dwane Carraway owned up to making a mistake and said that the city would reimburse Soto for his loss.

Dallas city council member Dwane Carraway holds Soto partially responsible because he hadn't finished bringing the house up to code after purchasing it

The city plans to revisit their demolition process to make sure things don't happen again.

He attributed the mishap to, 'a miscommunication between some departments in the city.'

Dallas News reports that Assistant City Manager Charles Cato released a similar statement calling the mistake a 'miscommunication between the two city departments, real estate, and Code Compliance.'

However, Carraway holds Soto partially responsible for not remodeling the home shortly after purchasing it.

'They have a responsibility to take that eyesore and bring it up to code, so the community doesn’t have to endure that,' said Carraway.

Soto bought three homes prior to the one that was demolished, all of which were renovated and brought to code

Soto already began fixing the home that was demolished by buying new windows and cabinets

Soto is a contractor and said that he's helped to change many homes. 'That's what I've been doing all my life,' he said to CBS.

According to Soto, he had been remodeling the house, but that it was in such poor condition when he bought it that the changes are taking time to complete.

He already bought cabinets and windows for the new home.

'They left a lot of mess inside, so it take three weeks for me to clean it up.'

This home is only one of the few homes Soto purchased from Dallas over the past few years.

Soto plans to build a home from scratch on the empty lot at Fordham Road

Neighbors of Soto's other properties told CBS on Wednesday that those homes had improved greatly over time.

Soto plans to keep his land on 2007 Fordham Road and build a home from scratch.

This is not the first time Dallas demolished a house by accident.Two homes in the Dallas, Fort Worth area were mistakenly torn down over the summer, NBC reports.

This caused the city to halt demolitions until they could improve the system. They attributed the flaws to 'human error.'

City Spokesperson Bill Begly said, 'And what they're trying to do now is put in place more accountability, more documentation, more eyes on the whole process.'

'The whole idea is to take the human error element out of the process and ensure that something like this doesn't happen again,' Begley said.
