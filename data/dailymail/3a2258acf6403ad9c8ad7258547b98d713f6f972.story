Accident: Sam McCaughey, 23, performed a balancing act on an upper floor ledge of his apartment block

A man died in a tragic balcony stunt just hours after arriving in Ibiza.

Sam McCaughey, 23, and his friends had visited the bars and pubs after beginning their holiday at the resort of San Antonio.

But Manchester Coroner’s Court heard how the night ended in tragedy when the electrical engineering student performed a daredevil balancing act on an upper floor ledge of his apartment block. 

Mr McCaughey, from Kirkway, 
Middleton, had gone for a weekend break with three friends, landing in 
the early hours of July 29 last year.

They immediately headed out to sample the nightlife.

David
Lancaster, 25, described how he became separated from his friends and 
had returned to their apartment in the early hours just in time to see 
his friend carry out the stunt. 

Giving evidence, he said: 'I heard someone shouting my name from across the pavement.

'It was Sam and he was jumping from balcony to balcony. He was on the fourth floor.

'I shouted at him to stop but he started balancing on it with his arms out like it was a tightrope.

'I could see what he was doing was crazy. I was screaming for him to come down.

'He was walking on his hands, putting one hand out over the other.

'It was kind of surreal. I couldn’t believe what was happening when I watched him fall.'

Assistant deputy coroner Carolyn Singleton ruled that Mr McCaughey, a student at the University of Central Lancashire, in Preston, had died accidentally.

She added: 'This was quite clearly a tragic accident. There is no other conclusion I could offer given the evidence.'

Addressing his father Paul McCaughey, the coroner added: 'It is not in the natural order of things for a parent to have to deal with the death of a child. You have my sincere condolences.'

A post-mortem test in the UK confirmed he died from serious multiple injuries and witness statements by Spanish police confirmed the circumstances.

Mr McCaughey, who attended St Thomas More primary and Cardinal Langley secondary schools in Middleton, was the eldest of three boys, with brothers Joel, 21, and 22-year-old Jack.

His family have paid tribute to ‘a very caring and considerate’ son who was ‘well loved and liked with many friends’.

Hundreds of condolences to the keen footballer and fitness fan were posted on Facebook.
