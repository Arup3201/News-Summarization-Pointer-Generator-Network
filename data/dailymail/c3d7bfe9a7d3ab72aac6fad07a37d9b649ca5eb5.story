Sitting pretty? Satisfaction with the site has plunged, according to a recent survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index

Facebook's new Timeline profile pages - a much-hyped feature unveiled by Mark Zuckerberg which expose a user's past - have hit a sour note with site users.

Satisfaction with the site has plunged, according to a recent survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.

'The big 
drop in user satisfaction - coming on the heels of Facebook’s somewhat 
disorderly IPO - doesn’t bode well for reversing the company’s sliding 
stock price,' says the institute.

Just 61% of site users are now happy with Facebook's service - and, astonishingly, the service is nwo less popular than Google's often-derided Google Plus network.

'Facebook’s drop coincides with the release of its Timeline profile, a 
significant change to the look and organization of its pages,' says the ACSCI. 'Users 
complain that they cannot opt out of the new profile design.'

Facebook is also less popular than Twitter, Wikipedia and Pinterest.

Because social media so frequently involves the sharing of personal information, privacy remains a major concern for users,' says the ACSCI.

The sheer volume of advertising on these sites is another contributor to low satisfaction. Many users are uneasy about how their personal information is used and often do not see value in the advertising messages that are targeted to them.'

Google's Plus network appears to be one of the biggest gainers in the market.

It has grown to 250 million users in a year - far above rivals such as Twitter - and now has 75 million daily visitors.

Practising what he preaches: Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg has already opted-in for the new profile feature

The 'timeline' view will give your Facebook page a more 'magazine-like' feel - and will, Mark Zuckerberg promises, 'tell the story of your life'

Timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years 'pre-Facebook'

'Google+, however, has grown to 250 million users in about a year and appears to benefit from a mobile app that is well liked, along with its ability to integrate other Google services like search, YouTube, and mail via the Google+ platform,' says the ACSI. 'In addition, the Google+ social network is not inundated with the kind of advertising that seems to irritate many Facebook and other social media users.'
