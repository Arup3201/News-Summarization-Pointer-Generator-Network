Insecure:  ames 'Diags' Bennewith  was so insecure about his skin that he has shelled out £150 on beauty facials to banish his acne in the hope of getting a girlfriend

It seems that the ladies of Essex's love of all things beauty is rubbing off on their male co-stars.

The latest TOWIE star to indulge in a spot of pampering is James 'Diags' Bennewith, who was so insecure about his skin that he shelled out £150 on beauty facials to banish his acne in an attempt to woo Fran Parman.

The 21-year-old has suffered from acne in the past and was desperate to have clear skin so he could get a girlfriend on the ITV2 reality show.

He underwent a red and blue LED light
 therapy treatment to get rid of his spots prior to his first date with 
Fran on the show last Sunday.

The
 21-year-old TV star admitted that he was self-conscious about the acne 
on his face but despite repeated attempts to shift it with spot creams 
and avoiding eating greasy food, nothing had worked.

James
 said: 'I’ve had acne from the age of 14 and it’s a real pain. I’m a guy
 so you just tend to deal with it but that doesn’t mean I’m happy about 
it.

'I’ve
 tried all sorts of spot creams but they don't really work, I was told 
about this new treatment by a friend so I thought I would try it out.

Did it work? Diags says he feels much more confident about his skin now and will be indulging in regular treatments

'The treatment was really relaxing and didn’t hurt a bit and when I looked in the mirror afterwards I could see a difference right away. The spots were reduced and the other skin areas looked much better and brighter.

'A day later and the effects were even better; the redness had gone down further and they were much smaller.

'I’m going to try to have a treatment every week if I can and after 10 weeks, the acne should be gone.'

Beauty fan: Diags underwent the £150 treatment, which uses LED light therapy, prior to his big date with Fran

The former university law student has previously been unlucky in love on The Only Way Is Essex ITV2 show, and has been eclipsed by cast-mates like Tom Pearce and Ricky Rayment.

So before filming started for the new series - which aired last Sunday - Diags decided to take a more scientific approach to treating his skin and tried the latest combined LED light therapy and dermabrasion facial treatment - Skinbreeze.

He went to London facialist Debbie Thomas for a course of treatments - that cost £145 - to clear his acne, which was especially prevalent on his right cheek.

It seemed that his treatment worked - he and Fran couldn’t keep their 
hands off each other as they watched the weigh-in for Lewis Bloor and 
Elliot Wright’s boxing match.

Wearing a pair of boxing gloves herself, Fran wrapped her arms around Diags and showered him with kisses throughout the evening.
