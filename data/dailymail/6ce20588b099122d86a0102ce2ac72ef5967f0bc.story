Russia has denied its troops have seized territory in strife-hit Crimea in a bizarre Twitter exchange with chick-lit writer and former MP Louise Mensch.

As pictures of unidentified heavily-armed troops occupying airports and ferry terminals and surrounding a Ukrainian infantry base emerge, Mensch has been demanding answers of the Russian Embassy on the powderkeg situation.

She initially tweeted: 'The only real "red lines" belong to Vladimir Putin. And they are marching west. #Obama #Ukraine #weak #tcot'

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has entered into a Twitter row with the UK's Russian Embassy over troop activity in Crimea

Mensch claims the armed men who have seized strategic parts of Crimea are Russian troops. The Russian Embassy claims the Russian President has not used the right to deploy forces abroad

The Russian Embassy's twitter account sent her a message directing her to a Russian government press release which they say clarifies the Russian position.

In response, Mensch called their attention to an article written by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the New York Times on the civil war in Syria, in which he writes that 'decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus'.

The embassy shot back that it is 
committed to seeking a political solution to the crisis, so Mensch 
tweeted: 'Excellent. Withdraw your tanks.'

Russia maintains it has not deployed troops throughout Crimea

The Russian Embassy tweeted back: 'The Russian President has not used the right to deploy forces abroad. We hope for a political settlement.'

At this point, Jamie Glackin, the vice chair of the Scottish Labour Party, joins the conversation, asking: 'So who are these Russian soldiers in Crimea I’m looking at on TV right now?'

Mensch also asks: 'He (Putin) has not? Am I to take it he considers the Crimea actually annexed?'

The row comes as fears mount over Russia's intentions in the region. Ukraine’s acting prime minister, Arseniy Yatseniuk, said today his country would never give up Crimea.

Russian forces have taken control of the 
Black Sea peninsula, which is part of Ukraine, but Yatseniuk told 
reporters: 'No one will give up Crimea to anyone.'

The U.S. now believes that Russia has complete operational control of the pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region.

President Vladimir Putin defended Russia's action against 'ultranationalist forces' - and told President Barack Obama he reserved the right to take any further military action.

Russia claims its troops have not 'deployed abroad'

Pro-Russian troops took over a ferry terminal on the easternmost tip of Crimea close to Russia on Monday, exacerbating fears that Moscow is planning to bring even more troops into this strategic Black Sea region.

The seizure of the terminal in the Ukrainian city of Kerch about 20 kilometers (12 miles) by boat to Russia, comes as the West try to figure out ways to halt and reverse the Russian incursion.

Early on Monday, soldiers were operating the terminal, which serves as a common departure point for many Russian-bound ships. The men refused to identify themselves, but they spoke Russian and the vehicles transporting them had Russian licence plates.

Troops that Ukraine says are Russian soldiers have occupied airports in Crimea, smashed equipment at an air base and besieged a Ukrainian infantry base in this peninsula.

Outrage over Russia's military moves mounted in world capitals, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from 'an incredible act of aggression'.

Russian troops are also massing close to the Ukrainian borders across a wide area. For example, heavily armoured forces from Samara are heading for the border with the Kharkiv region.

The same is seen at the border with Chernigov, which is only 120 miles from Kiev.
