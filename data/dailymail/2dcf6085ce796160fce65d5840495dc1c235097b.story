Iran today vowed down to track down the filmmaker who produced an anti-Islamic film which has provoked protests around the world.

As fresh protests broke out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi issued an stark message directed at Nakoula Basseley Nakoula - who lives in California - who was behind The Innocence of Muslims.

'The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns... this inappropriate and offensive action,' Mr Rahimi said.

'Certainly it will search for, track and pursue this guilty person who... has insulted 1.5billion Muslims worldwide.'

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also issued a statement, calling on the West to show it respects Islam by blocking the film. They must prove they were not 'accomplices' in a 'big crime', he said.

The comments came on the day that:

The demonstrations were the latest across the world ignited by a short film made with private funds in the US and posted on the Internet that depicted the Prophet Mohammad as a fool, a womaniser and a homosexual.

The situation saddles U.S. President Barack Obama with an unexpected foreign policy headache as he campaigns for re-election in November, even though his administration has condemned the film as reprehensible and disgusting.

In a torrent of violence last week, the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack in Benghazi and US and other foreign embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by furious Muslims. At least nine other people have been killed.

Washington has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble.

A White House spokesman said Obama spoke by telephone to senior diplomats at the weekend to reassure them of his support.

'He called the chiefs of mission in Sudan, Tunisia, Libya and Yemen to let those diplomats know that he was thinking about them, that their safety remains a top priority of his, and it is something he will remain focused on,' spokesman Josh Earnest said.

Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the new violence adds to a host of problems including the continued U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts.

Earlier the leader of the militatn group Hezbollah Sheik Hassan Nasrallah called for protests against the movie and said the US must be held accountable for the film.

'Those who should be held accountable, punished, prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them, primarily the United States of America,' Mr Nasrallah said.

He called for protests on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too.

'We should not only express our anger at an American embassy here or there. We should tell our rulers in the Arab and Muslim world that it is "your responsibility in the first place" and since you officially represent the governments and states of the Muslim world you should impose on the United States, Europe and the whole world that our prophet, our Quran and our holy places and honor of our Prophet be respected,' he said.

A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which
is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on 
YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site.

The
violence began Tuesday when mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S.
Embassy walls in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the 
American flag from a pole in the courtyard.

Chris
Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, also was killed Tuesday along 
with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate 
in Benghazi.

President 
Barack Obama has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice 
but also stressed that the U.S. respects religious freedom.

The
President's response was echoed by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, 
who called into BBC's Radio 4 Monday morning to discuss the continued 
violence.

Mr Blair, now 
Middle East envoy for the Quartet of powers, said: 'The film, it may be 
wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film-making.

'What I am afraid is very dangerous and actually is wrong is the reaction to it.'

Mr
Blair said such problems were an inevitable consequence of the Arab 
Spring that has overthrown repressive regimes in Libya and elsewhere.

'I
just see a region that is in the process of huge transition. There is 
essentially a struggle between the forces of modernisation, who want an 
open society, a properly functioning economy, who recognise the 21st 
century is the 21st century, and then those of reaction based on a 
perverted view of religion, that want to pull the whole thing 
backwards,' he said.

'When 
you lift the lid off the repression what comes out are a whole lot of 
religious, ethnic, tribal influences that themselves have to be 
countered and moulded into something that is compatible with the modern 
world.'

Mr Blair said he had changed his view since his time in Number 10, when he used to avoid discussions about faith.

'What
the politicians often want to do - for totally understandable reasons, I
used to feel this myself - is religion is such a tricky subject for us 
that we want to stay away from it,' he said.

'But one element of resolving this is about a view of religion that is also open-minded and pluralistic.

'And
what you actually require for democracy to function properly is a view 
of democracy in which religion has its place but where you have 
democracy-friendly religion as well as religion-friendly democracy.'

He
added: 'In the end we need both the leadership within those countries 
and within Islam to stand up and say ‘look, there is a proper modern way
of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society’, and we need 
ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a 
way that’s constructive.'
