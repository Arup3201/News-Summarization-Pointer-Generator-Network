Fox news host Steve Doocy said the movie empowered women by turning men into 'fools and villians'

Disney's animated smash hit Frozen has been accused of spreading anti-male propaganda by a US news host.

Steve Doocy slammed the film for its lack of strong male characters  during an early morning talk show.

He claimed that the movie empowered its female fans by turning men into 'fools and villains.'

In a three minute segment on  Fox and Friends Doocy discussed the so-called 'Frozen effect' with Penny Young Nance, the CEO of Concerned Women for America.

To illustrate the point the show reportedly showed a clip from the movie of good guy Kristoff discussing picking his nose and another of villain Prince Hans confessing his evil plan.

The 2013 movie is inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale the Snow Queen and tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on an epic journey alongside an iceman, his pet reindeer,and a naive snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.

'They depict men as evil and cold and bumblers,' Ms Young Nance said on the show KSDK,com reported.

''It's not just Disney. 

'It's Hollywood in general that has often sent the message that men are superfluous, they're stupid, they're in the way, if they contribute anything to the family, it's a paycheck.' 

Doocy is said to have later added that it would be 'nice' if there were more 'strong male figures' in movies such as Frozen, it was reported. 

Frozen took over a billion dollars at the global box office, and is the most successful animated movie of all time. It also won a Golden Globe for the best animated film. 

Doocy's comments come after a seven minute short film reunites the cast, characters, directors and even songwriters of the original 2013 movie, and will be screened ahead of Disney's Cinderella.
