Parents know all too well that sickening feeling when they turn around to discover their child has unbuckled their seatbelt but a new invention will now put their minds at ease.

With 90 percent of cars not fitted with a seatbelt alert system for the backseats in Australia there is too much potential for parents to not realise that their kids are unrestrained until it's too late.

Although as many as 99 percent of parents say they always restrain their children at the beginning of the trip - it is the potential for what can happen when the driver's eyes are peeled to the road which is the concern.

However, an Australian-made seatbelt safety system aptly called, buckle me up, could take that worry away for adults.

Deborah Khoury, pictured with her three girls, Sarah, Hannah and Amelia, has trialled the buckle me up device for three weeks which has worked a treat both times one of her children has unbuckled while she was driving

The small device, similar to an E-Tag, is mounted to the dashboard, and wirelessly connects with small monitors on seatbelts so the driver is alerted both visually and with sound if a child unbuckles their belt

Only NSW and WA have statistics of fatalities of children not wearing seatbelts:

Mother-of-three Deborah Khoury, from Sydney, has been trialling the device for three weeks which has worked a treat both times one of her children has unbuckled while she was driving.

'It's really comforting because it comes on in a second so I just press the button at the start of the trip and then don't have to take my eyes off the road to see if they are buckled up,' she said.

'I think it will happen less and less because it's teaching them that when the alarm goes off something serious has happened.'

Ms Khoury feels extremely fortunate to not have experienced accidents when her children has taken off their belt without her knowing.

'It can make me quite emotional really,' she says. 'I have had to put the brakes on quickly and the kids move forward which is when I've realised they are unrestrained which makes you think of all of the terrible accidents that could have happened like going through the windscreen.'

Greg Pace, a Northern Sydney region firefighter for 18 years, knows all to well the dangers involved when children have undone their belts during the journey

According to a 2013 study by Monash University Accident Research Centre, children are 12 times more distracting to a driver than talking on a mobile phone while at the wheel.

Greg Pace, a Northern Sydney region firefighter for 18 years, is very familiar with the dangers involved when children have undone their belts during a car journey.

Mr Pace recalls attending the scene of a car crash a few years ago when a five-year-old boy had undone his lap sash around his booster seat and was thrown underneath the passenger side seat.

'It took me and my team over an hour just to remove the child from under the seat due to the injuries he sustained,' he said.

'Once we got him out of the car, he was rushed to hospital with a broken leg - it was the femur which is a very hard bone to break, a broken arm and a broken nose.'

'The mother of the child was in hysterics – she was crying as she had sworn she’d buckled up the child at the start of the journey.'

Ms Khoury is a psychotherapist who has counselled clients that have lost children in car accidents when they were unbuckled from their seats.

'Losing a little one is serious stuff - it's devastating,' she said. 'It isn't something that you would ever get over - it will stay with you forever especially if it's something that you could have been avoided - it could haunt you for the rest of your life.'

This device could save not only a child's life but also a lifetime of unbearable guilt endured by parents
