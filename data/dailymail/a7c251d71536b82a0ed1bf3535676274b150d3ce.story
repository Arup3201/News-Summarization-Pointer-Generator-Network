For two 'home-schooled' young women, Kendall and Kylie Jenner are certainly talented.

And the reality stars turned fashion designers turned models have revealed their latest career move - with the release their first novel.

The ghost-written teen fiction Rebels: The Story Of Lex And Livia went on sale on Tuesday morning, and the sisters were on hand to promote it to their fans.

Writers in residence: Kendall and Kylie promoted their new teen novel Rebels: City Of Indra, The Story Of Lex And Livia, on Good Morning America earlier in the day

Book worms: The sisters have written their first novel, a piece of teen fiction, with the help of a ghost writer

Kylie, 16, wore a pretty black dress as the pair made an early start promoting their new novel on Tuesday.

Her big sister Kendall was equally stylish in a navy blue dress with a cut out at the waist.

Appearing first on Good Morning America, then Kelly And Michael, the teens plugged their book, which promises to be the first of a series about the fictional 'City Of Indra'.

Despite Kendall joking 'I'm the worst reader' after flubbing her lines at the Billboard Awards last month, it seems she has changed her tune.

'I think that we had gone to a meeting and decided what we would like to see in a movie,' she said of their inspiration for the book.

Of COURSE we wrote it! There was no mention of novelist Maya Sloan as the two gushed about their new role

Model turned designer turned author: Kendall is certainly talented

Kylie explained: 'It took us two years, so we've obviously been working on it for a while. It was awesome just seeing it grow.'

But while the girls were enjoying the spotlight, there was sign of the ghost writer - novelist Maya Sloan - as the two gushed about their new product.

However Kendall admitted they had help, adding: 'We obviously can't write a sci-fi novel on our own.'

While it was Sloan who typed out the tale, the book's publishers claim it came 'from the minds of Kendall and Kylie'.

Maya told XOXO After Dark last summer she enjoys listening to teen's ideas.

'I
 worked with lots of teenagers, both teaching theatre and writing,' she explained. 'I 
just like how they think… [I] listen to them. Ask them questions and ask 
what matters to them.'

I wrote a book! Kendall signs copies of her new novel

With
 her help Kendall and Kylie have created what publishers Karen Hunter 
dub 'a thrilling dystopian story about two super-powered girls who 
embark on a journey together, not knowing they’re twins.'

Set 200 years in the future, Rebels is clearly aimed at the Jenner's contemporaries.

And despite initially lacklustre reviews, the Jenner name is sure to produce huge sales.

Multi-talented: Kylie and her sister also appeared on Kelly and Michael

Sister act: The reality stars turned designers are now authors

For belying their tender ages the pair, who grew up in the spotlight on Keeping Up 
With The Kardashians, already have impressive resumes.

Having
 tried their hands at designing, with their range for PacSun, they have 
also modelled - with Kendall proving especially successful.

The 18-year-old has appeared on the international fashion show circuit and even graced the pages of Vogue.

On GMA the two were quizzed about their famous family - especially sister Kim, whose wedding to Kanye West they attended last week.

'The whole wedding was just filled with so much love,' Kylie said. 'It was just really amazing to watch that.

'And to see two people so happy,' Kendall added.

And asked about their troubled brother Rob, who skipped the wedding, Kendall replied simply: 'He’s doing really well.'

All dressed up: Kylie wore a belted fit and flare coat over her short dress

Speaking
 on Kelly And Michael later in the day, Kendall opened up about moving 
into her own apartment - which she has just purchased.

She admitted her mother Kris Jenner wasn't happy about her decision.

'She came up to me and told me she cried herself to sleep a couple of nights,' Kendall revealed.

And
 she added that her mother helped her make the move: ' I picked out all 
my stuff but she basically got it all in there. I offered to help, but 
she wouldn't let me!'
