She was the American society beauty who captured the heart of a king and changed the course of British and Commonwealth history in the process.

Now a stunning collection of jewels that shed light on the extraordinary love affair between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is to go on sale at Sotheby's.

Among the pieces going under the hammer today is a silver watch that tells of Simpson's heartbreak after being forced to separate from her future husband in the months leading up to his abdication.

Love story: Jewels and mementos belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor will go on sale at Sotheby's

Magnificent: Stunning jewels including a sapphire bracelet and diamond medallion will also be part of the sale

Present: This inscribed silver cigarette case was given to the future Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary

The keepsake, which was sent to Edward VIII in 1937, even bears an inscription in Simpson's handwriting, which reads, simply: 'Wallis Easter 28 - III - 37 David'.

Also included in the sale are examples from Simpson's magnificent jewellery collection, among them a stunning sapphire bracelet by Cartier that is expected to fetch between Â£130,000 and Â£180,000.

Other jewels belonging to Simpson include a coral, diamond and emerald torsade choker, made by Cartier for the then Duchess of Windsor in 1949.

There is also a stunning pair of diamond, enamel and coral clips commissioned by the royal couple from Van Cleef & Arpels and presented to the Duke's private secretary Anne Segrim as a Christmas gift.

But not every piece in the sale 
belonged to the American duchess. Also included in the sale are pieces linked 
to other members of the Royal Family, including Queen Victoria, her son 
Edward VII and his wife Queen Alexandra.

Particularly touching is a silver frame presented by the Queen-Empress to the future Edward VIII on his fourth birthday that bears the inscription: 'From Great Grandmama V.R.I 24th May 1899'.

Heartbreak: This fob watch was given to the Duke by the Duchess in the months leading up to his abdication

Another gift in the collection, a silver cigarette case, carries an equally affecting message and was given to Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary of Teck.

The rectangular cigarette case, featuring an elaborate silver basket-work design, has an inscription on the inside that reads: 'Darling David from Mama, God bless you, 1925'.

Sotheby's, which achieved a world record sales total when it auctioned the rest of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels in 1987, hopes that the new collection will be similarly well received.

'Sotheby's 1987 landmark sale of the jewels of the Duchess of Windsor remained the most valuable single-owner jewellery sale for almost a quarter of a century and inaugurated a new era in the jewellery auction market,' explained David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's jewellery division in Europe and the Middle East.

'Three years ago, we witnessed the continuing fascination for this collection when 20 pieces from the original sale reappeared at auction in Sotheby's London and established new price levels.

'We are delighted to present this further selection of attractive jewels and precious objects, which shed light on the Duke's life, and what has been called the greatest love story of the 20th century.'

The sale of 459 lots will be held in two sessions beginning at 10am and again at 2pm.

Enduring: After refusing to give Mrs Simpson up, the former Edward VIII abdicated in favour of his brother

Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family - and the UK - has ever faced.

But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king.

The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love.

At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on the 20th January 1936.

When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her.

This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees.

Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan.

By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country.

Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on the 13th December 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII.

The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the 3rd June 1937 in the south of France.

Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'
