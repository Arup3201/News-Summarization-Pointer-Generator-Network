To all of those closest to him and, indeed, those who thought they knew him best, Grant Trebilco was the happy-go-lucky, 'nothing gets me down' surfer dude. But that 'could not have been further from the truth'.

Three years ago, as bipolar consumed his life, the now 33-year-old found himself at his lowest ebb. He no longer cared for the beautiful eastern Sydney beaches he'd called home since moving across the ditch from New Zealand.

'Mate, all I know is that I tried to run away from it and one day, I'm not exactly sure how I got there either, but I was sitting alone in a hotel room in Mexico and in a very dark place,' he admitted.

'I was stuck there just thinking about ways of ending it, I was manic and had lost all sense of everything and decided to walk in front of a car. In the end, I never did that.

'Instead, I called my brother ... and you know that conversation probably changed my life.'

Surfing away the blues. Grant Trebilco has come up with a novel way of trying to beat Bipolar, the same disorder he shares with his father

The family connection to this story doesn't end there.

Grant returned home to Maunganui in the Bay of Plenty to discuss his mental health issues with his father, only to find out that 64-year-old Bruce Trebilco had, just like his son, been diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years earlier.

'Again, no one knew but apparently he had it from a very young age'.

His personal and private battle has led to him starting Fluro Friday, helping surfers of all abilities realise how catching one wave can improve your mood.

The Fluro Fridays are most definitely a family affair with Grant's mum Alison and his dad Bruce among those joining the fun and frivolity to help raise awareness

Bipolar symptoms vary but those with the disorder can experience periods of over-excitement and recklessness, as well as suffering low self-esteem, feeling helpless and being depressed.

'I went from being the life of the party to being completely down and depressed and often found myself behaving in a totally irrational, risky manner,' Grant admitted.

Surfers of all shapes and sizes come out to play to send a very serious message on 'Fluro Fridays'

'I knew there was a problem one day when I stopped midway through my speech at an event, I broke down and just walked out. I sought help but was actually misdiagnosed as suffering depression.

'Ultimately I spent 10 days in hospital and they found out what the real cause was.'

Bipolar will affect up to 460,000 Australians at some point in their life and those afflicted with the disorder tend to have a higher rate of relationship problems, accidental injuries and, in the worst cases, suicide.

Significantly, more than half of all sufferers will turn to drugs or alcohol at an outlet.

'I was working for a tequila company at the time - in hindsight probably not a good combination for someone with bipolar, was it?'

There are no rules on 'Fluro Fridays' wherever they are held, all Grant wants is to 'put a smile on your face'

After a close friend confided in Grant, that he too was bipolar, 'I just decided one day to just throw on a suit and tie and hit the water and when my mate Sam (Schumacher) joined me a couple of weeks later we decided to call it our board meeting. From there it just took off'.

The so-called 'board meetings' morphed into 'Fluro Fridays' and Grant and friends went on to establish Onewave, a not-for-profit surf group whose main focus is to raise awareness of mental health matters.

'It's a simple recipe really - saltwater, surfing, good mates and of course some crazy coloured get-ups - the more colourful, the better,' he said.

'We have a saying that one wave is all it takes, to get you smiling and to give you hope.

'And if it gets just one more person talking about their problems, then we've succeeded.'

At sunrise each Friday, dozens of surfers don the fluro colours at Sydney beaches like Bondi, Manly and Wanda and further north, including Avoca and Merewether.

'Fluro Fridays' fever has taken off internationally too; including beaches in Bali, Thailand, Fiji, New Zealand, Hawaii, Spain and Mexico.

Grant Trebilco says it doesn't matter if you're a surfer, footy player or office worker 'sometimes it's okay not to be okay'
