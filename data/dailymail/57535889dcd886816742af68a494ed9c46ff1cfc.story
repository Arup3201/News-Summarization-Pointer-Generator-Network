Wayne Rooney has revealed how he once stood amongst Arsenal fans in the away end at Anfield to cheer on his mate Francis Jeffers.

The 17-year-old had just burst onto the scene with Everton when he went behind enemy lines to watch the Liverpool vs Arsenal clash in January 2003.

Rooney and Jeffers both went to Our Lady and St Swithin's primary school in Croxteth, Liverpool and both came through the youth ranks at Everton.

Jeffers moved to Arsenal in 2001 and was an unused substitute at Anfield that day as the Premier League match ended 2-2.

Speaking ahead of England's Tuesday night friendly with Scotland in Glasgow, captain Rooney was recalling the games he'd watched down the years as a fan.

He said: 'I've done it with Everton, at Ibrox and at Anfield, watching Liverpool vs Arsenal, when Franny Jeffers was there.'

When asked if he had to go to Anfield incognito, he replied: 'Not really. I didn't go in disguise.'

Rooney won his 100th international cap on Saturday in England's 3-1 European Championship qualifying win over Slovenia.

He will again lead the line at Celtic Park when England take on the Auld Enemy in what is expected to be a fiesty clash.

Jeffers' £8m move from Everton to Arsenal didn't work out and he scored just four goals for the club.

He won his one and only England cap on the night Rooney also made his debut - against Australia in a friendly at Upton Park in February 2003.

The match Rooney referenced, on January 29, 2003, ended 2-2. John Arne Riise and Emile Heskey scored for Liverpool, Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp for Arsenal.
