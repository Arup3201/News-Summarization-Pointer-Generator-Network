Heather Watson has edged a gruelling three-set encounter with Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 6-7 (3/7) 7-6 (7/5) to advance at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.

The British number one bridged a 45-place gap in the singles rankings to topple the Slovakian, who beat her in straight sets at the Australian Open earlier this year.

Watson flew out of the blocks in the opening set, with the world number 12 never even getting close to making inroads on her serve.

After that Cibulkova tightened things up and the pair were virtually inseparable as they went toe-to-toe in the final two sets.

But the 10th seed fell just short in the winner-takes-all final tie-break as Watson set up a third round clash with Victoria Azarenka.
