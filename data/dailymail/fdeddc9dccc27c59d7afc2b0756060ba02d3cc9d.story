The bomb squad was called in and 
neighbours evacuated in the early hours after a man was killed following
a suspected arson attack on his home.

Firefighters rushed to the blaze in the early hours of this morning and tried to rescue the man, aged in his 60s from the burning bungalow.

Paramedics were also called to the single-storey terraced home but the man was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.

Probe: Detectives had launched an investigation into the fire at a bungalow in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshrie which killed a man in his 60s

Sealed off: The damaged home was cordoned off as forensic teams examined the site for clues

Police confirmed that they were treating the incident as a suspicious death 
and neighbours spoke of forensic investigators marking out a trail 
along the pathway from the house to a nearby car.

Emergency services were called to the bungalow just after midnight after reports of a fire in the single-storey terrace.

The blaze appeared to have started at the man's doorway, possibly by accelerant being poured through the letter-box.

When firefighters arrived the flames had spread and as they battled them inside the bungalow they discovered the body of the man, who one neighbour described as a builder.

Police were already at the scene, having been notified two minutes after the first 999 call.

Resident Andrew Marsh said: 'The first I knew was when the police came knocking on the door.

'By the time I had got my keys and unlocked the door they had walked away but there were police and ambulance crews all around.

Investigation: Scenes of crime officers were working alongside specialist fire investigators to establish what had caused the blaze

'Later the firemen went into my property and it had smoke in it and they
said the carbon monoxide level was quite high and they wanted me out.'

He added: 'They said there was something suspicious in there (the house 
on fire) that looked like explosives and they wanted us out of our 
homes, from the first three bungalows.'

Police have said that they were treating the man's death as suspicious and had launched a probe into the fire, which broke out at 12.06am today.

Scenes of crime officers were working alongside specialist fire investigators from Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service to establish exactly what had caused the fire at the orange-bricked home.

Meanwhile specially trained police officers were helping the man's grieving family to come to terms with his death.

He has not yet been formally identified.

Fortunately Mr Marsh' parents live a few doors away and he went to stay with them.

As they watched they saw a white bomb squad lorry arrive at the address, in Westerdale, Hemel Hempstead, Herts.

Mr Marsh, a 49-year-old aerospace worker, said of the dead man: 'I don't know him but I have seen him.

Emergency: Fire crews were called out to the bungalow in the early hours of this morning but were unable to save the man

Suspect: Police were treating the incident as a suspicious and neighbours spoke of forensic investigators marking out a trail along the pathway from the house to a nearby car

'He has been living there a few years now. He was a builder or something like that.

'He used to have a green van and I had always seen stuff like building materials outside.'The residents were allowed back to their homes around 4am.

Mr Marsh's father, Joseph Cannone, 81 years, has lived in the street since the homes were built, in 1970.

He said: 'The police are still here. They have marked all down the road with those little pyramids with numbers on, close on 100 yards.

'There is a car parked on the edge of a little wood and they have put a police cordon completely around that.

'There are a lot of detectives and scenes of crime officers around.'

There was also a police forensic tent erected outside the bungalow.

Mr Marsh said he believed the car that had been cordoned off belonged to another neighbour who lived further down the street.

Appeal: Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ross asked anyone with information about the fatal fire to come forward

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ross is
leading the inquiry and has appealed for anyone who might have seen 
anything suspicious around the house.

He said: 'Whilst the investigation is still in its early stages, we are treating the man's death as suspicious at this time.

'We are providing specialist support to the victim's family at this distressing time.

'Although
this incident occurred during the night, the property is in a 
residential area and there may have been people who may have seen or 
heard suspicious activity.

'I would appeal to anyone who believes they can assist the investigation, to contact us as soon as possible.'

A spokesman for Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that three fire engines had been sent to the blaze - two from Hemel Hempstead and one from Redbourn.

'We were called at 12.04am to a fire in the entrance hall to a bungalow,' he said.

'The fire investigation is ongoing.'
