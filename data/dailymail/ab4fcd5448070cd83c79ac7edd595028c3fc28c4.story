The National Rifle Association is trying to boost female membership with the relaunch of its online TV channel dedicated to 'armed and fabulous' women who claim they need a gun to defend themselves.

A slick trailer titled 'New Energy' features attractive women posing with their firearms as they opine that the media and the American public in general 'really desperately need an education' on guns.

The revamped channel, NRAWomen.TV, and the lobby group's bid to refocus the gun control debate on women comes after a recent poll found nearly two thirds of females favor stronger gun laws compared to just 44 per cent of males.

'Basically, they want everyone to be afraid of firearms and they're not focusing on a woman being able to protect herself,' Mia Astine says in the promotion.

Another woman in the short clip advocates the use of semi-automatic weapons, suggesting the media is misrepresenting the guns, which were used in numerous massacres including the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

'A lot of people always come back and say why do you need this, why do you need this, why do you need this,' Maggie Reese says.

'... they are not assault weapons and they are not military-style weapons, that is terminology that somebody else has developed for the gun. What it is, is it's a sporting rifle and it's a self-defense rifle and it's a hunting rifle.'

Another woman claims having a gun is about being able to protect her child, as the toddler crawls on the floor at the gun range, while advocate Julianna Crowder bemoans any loss of civil rights.

She says: 'So many things could change if we start losing our civil rights and our most basic civil rights of self-defense. If people are willing to give up that thing then they're willing to give up others.'

The women's channel is pitched at a new generation of potential gun owners as the organization strives to attract young, educated women who are prepared to lobby its interests in Washington.

'This is important to me. I'm a diverse educated woman that (lawmakers) need to listen to and I'm not going to be pigeonholed into one category of "oh, gun owner." We come from all walks of life and we have something to say about it,' Julie Golob explains in the trailer.

Natalie Foster goes on to claim that 'right now is our time. As women we get to get out there and we get to tell people what this is all about.'

She adds, giggling: 'Becoming a shooter and a gun owner, I feel so empowered.'

The dramatic trailer ends with the tag line: 'We are competitors, we are mothers, we are business owners, we are hunters, we are enthusiasts, we are teachers, we are the face of the American gun owner. We are the NRA. NRA Women's Network.'

The new approach follows a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that highlights the enduring gender divide over gun control.

Experts note this divide has been a long-standing trend, with a Pew Research Center survey from March showing the current gap is similar to that between men and women 20 years ago.

The Pew Survey showed that while more women own guns today than they did 20 years ago, men are still three times more likely to own guns than women.

It also shows how owning a gun affects your opinions on gun laws.

For example, 66 per cent of those who live in homes without a gun say stricter laws would reduce mass shootings compared to 35 per cent of those who do own guns.

In addition, 56 per cent of women believe that stricter gun laws would reduce accidental deaths, compared to 47 per cent of men.

Margie Omero, from Purple Strategies' research, added that women in particular are worried about mass shooting and violence within their communities.

'There's a post-Newtown effect that, in particular, hit women, who were more likely to say that Newtown made them want to support stronger gun laws as a result,' she said.
