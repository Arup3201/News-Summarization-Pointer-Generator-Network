As they pull at a wonky bike stand in the small hours of the morning outside a kebab shop, many would automatically presume that this group of lads were drunkenly vandalising their town centre.

But far from being a bunch of thoughtless thugs, these revellers were actually public-spirited Good Samaritans who were repairing a damaged rack.

The high-spirited group were caught on CCTV repairing a broken bike rack after a night out - using a team effort to heave the stand back into place.

All together! The group of lads abandon their takeaways to try and pull back the severely bent bike rack

Heave-ho! The group can be seen gritting their teeth as they embark on their good deed

The damage had been reported to the council but the young men stepped in before it was repaired - and one ended up completely beneath it as he strained to pull it back to its original shape

The rack, which had been damaged for several weeks, caught their attention as they queued for Kebabs in Boston Market Place in the early hours of the morning.

Footage shows the group putting down their take aways and planning a repair strategy, before using their muscles to unbend the thick metal hoop which had been damaged when a car reversed into it.

The group can be seen discussing their tactics before spending almost 13 minutes straightening the metal hook at 3am. 

The group can be seen gesturing to 
each other before nodding at each other and three of them grabbing the 
rack, as they try to pull it back to move it back into place.

At one point one ends up underneath the rack, using his feet to push himself back. 

When that fails, they rope in two 
others, who then sit on the other side and push to help the trio who 
pull with all their might.

After
repairing it, they can be seen high-fiving each other and been giving 
the thumbs-up by a crowd who has watched their efforts.

The group discuss their strategy and recruit two other helpers to fix the dented rack, which a car had reversed into

The group can be seen shouting encouragement at each other as they end their night with a charitable act

The group spent the best part of 15 minutes pushing and pulling the dented rack - and have been praised as 'public spirited'

That deserves another kebab! Pleased with their hard work, the group are congratulated by an admiring crowd

The damage had been reported to the council but the young men stepped in before it was repaired.

Friends Martin Griggs, 24, and Dean Mason, 23 who were joined by pals Simon McMillan and Dan Butler, both 23, have since become internet sensations.

Barman Martin, who lives in the town, said: 'We saw the bike rack and thought it was a bit knackered and it's been broken for a while.

'We are both cyclists and had noticed it hadn't been fixed for a few weeks, we were a bit inebriated, so decided to mend it.

'We started pulling it this way and went "this isn't happening", so we tried various ways and put our legs into it.

'The feedback we have had has been ridiculous. Random people have sent us messages saying well done. Its come as a bit of a shock.

'We did it at the end of a night out, we had all probably had too much to drink and thought it would be a good idea and didn't think anymore of it afterwards.

'There was a big cheer at the end. It was great.

The group said it was a spur of the moment decision after they had enjoyed a couple of drinks to fix the busted bike rack

Dean and Martin have already been congratulated by Mayor Cllr Paul Kenny and CCTV and community safety portfolio holder Cllr Stephen Woodliffe

'We didn't know what the police would think if they saw it. They are more used to people vandalising and breaking stuff.

'Most people don't go out with an intention of breaking something or being a nuisance - but there are a lot of nice people in the town.'

Dean, a chef, added: 'We do feel quite proud of ourselves. I think we did a good job. Everybody is very happy about it.

'People have been saying 'good on you' and that it's nice to see lads not just destroying the place and doing good for once.

'People were cheering us on saying go that way or this way and we all high-fived and hugged at the end.

'Its not the first time we've helped out, we sometimes help drunk people get into taxis.

'We like to do our bit here and there.

'People keep sending it to us on Facebook and sending videos, the response has been overwhelming.'

Boston Borough Council said it was surprised by their actions and called it 'public spirited'.

Councillor Stephen Woodliffe, from Boston
Borough Council, said he had found it 'remarkable' as he watched the 
men on the CCTV footage.

'Young people often get a bad press and this shows there are some who want to contribute to their society and do the right thing,' he said.

'It shows young people acting in a very positive and constructive manner and shows they have a good and responsible attitude to what's happening in their town.

'Their actions were very public spirited and impressive.'

Peter Hunn, Boston Borough Council's safety officer, said: 'We recorded the whole sequence. At first two lads had a go and then encouraged others to help.

'At one point five were pushing and pulling. To look at the bike rack now you would hardly know it had been damaged.

'The night-time economy is not all about bad lads doing bad things.'
