As temperatures dropped to -30 degree Celsius, residents of Ontario could be forgiven for rejecting the great outdoors in favour of keeping warm inside.

But one father refused to be deterred by the bitter temperatures and found an ingenious way to pass the long winter hours of sub-zero temperatures by creating a colorful ice fort in his backyard.

Chris Marchand filled hundreds of eight-litre plastic shoeboxes with water and food colouring - he filled about 30 each day.

As temperatures dropped to -30 residents of north-western Ontario residents could be forgiven for rejecting the great outdoors in favour of keeping warm inside

He stored them in his driveway for a month until he had created enough to create his vision.

Mr
 Marchand then set about building the boundary of a 25â€² x 25â€² fort - it 
took him six nights working in -30 degree Celsius temperatures to erect the wall.

When the work was complete he invited over his friends and family to enjoy a night in his creation, as he sat back and admired his vision as king of his castle.

Mr
 Marchand explains: 'Sidelined from my usual outdoor pursuits by the 
cold, I started freezing blocks of ice on my deck for the hell of it.

As well as creating a fort he wanted to create a colorful vision so he choose dye including blue, orange, purple, pink and green

Mr Marchand then set about building the boundary of a 25' x 25' fort - it took him six nights work at -30 degree Celsius to erect the wall

'I marked off a 25' x 25' space and started building my wall on a 1 foot pony wall of snow that i compacted using plywood scraps,'  said Mr Marchand

'I found a certain kind of shoebox 
size plastic container that could handle the expansion and would release
 the frozen blocks easily and consistently without having to use hot 
water.

'Mass production began at 30 blocks per day - a new harvest every 12 hours. It was huge pain in the a** after a while.

'I
 marked off a 25' x 25' space and started building my wall on a 1 foot 
pony wall of snow that i compacted using plywood scraps. Construction 
took about 5 or six nights of frigid work in temps ranging from -28 to 
-35C. I loved being out in the cold with the iPod and some Iron and 
Wine, maybe a slushy mug of actual wine.

'I would mix snow and water to make slush mortar that would freeze solid within minutes in those cold temps.'

The fort begins to take shape - Mr Marchand braved the bitter temperatures of night to create his ice vision

Mr Marchand posted the photos of his progress on the internet and his creation and dedication to the project has earned him lots of fans
