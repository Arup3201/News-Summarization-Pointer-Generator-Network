Controversial ‘green’ plans to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph in a bid to cut pollution levels from cars are to be scrapped by ministers.

The reversal comes after the Government’s Highways Agency announced in January that the existing national speed limit of 70mph would be curtailed on certain sections of motorways policed with a new generation of speed camera.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will today announce he is ‘rejecting’ this approach stating: ‘I want all motorways to run at 70mph.’ 

Plans announced in January to reduce speed limits to 60mph have been abandoned

A lower variable speed limit ‘must only apply when absolutely necessary’, he says adding: ‘Blanket reductions are not acceptable.’

Motorways must instead maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible ‘particularly when traffic tends to be lighter, such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours,’ he said.

Motoring groups hailed the decision as ‘a victory for common sense.’ 

The controversial go-slow 60mph limits announced in January  by the Highways Agency  would have meant  speed limit slashed from 70mph on a three-mile section of the M3 between junction 3 at Lightwater in Surrey and junction 4 near Farnborough in Hampshire.

The lower 60mph were supposed to operate between 7am and 7pm daily to meet air quality levels imposed by Brussels.

Controversial 60mph speed limits were also planned for a 32-mile stretch of the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock in Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham in South Yorkshire – again on  air quality grounds. 

It too was supposed to apply for 12 hours a day - from 7am to 7pm -  seven days a week and be enforced by speed-cameras and police patrols.

That stretch of motorway goes past Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield – and also through nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA) described as ‘pockets of poor air.’ 

But today ministers will announce that 70mph must remain the norm except in exceptional circumstances.

A Transport Department spokesman said: ‘The Highways Agency previously consulted on proposals to limit speeds to 60mph between 7am and 7pm seven days a week because of the potential effect of the new schemes on local air quality.

‘However, the Transport Secretary has rejected this approach as the Government’ s preferred option for managing the problem.

‘He has instead asked the Highways Agency to rigorously investigate alternatives as work progresses on the schemes in the next 12 to 18 months.

‘If any proposals continue to include varying speed limits, they must only apply when absolutely necessary. In particular, the Agency must look for alternatives that maintain the 70mph limit wherever possible, particularly when traffic tends to be lighter, such as at weekends and outside of peak commuting hours.’ 

Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin, the Secretary of State for Transport, has rejected calls to lower motorway speed limits to 60mph

Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Let me be absolutely clear, I want all motorways to run at 70mph. While it sometimes makes sense to use variable limits to keep people moving, blanket reductions are not acceptable.’

This way the three new ‘smart’ motorway schemes on the M1 and M3 will ‘cut congestion and give Britain’s drivers smoother, quicker journeys’, he said giving the green light for construction will now start on the M1 junctions 28-31 in Derbyshire, M1 junctions 32-35a in South Yorkshire and on the M3 at junction 2-4a in Surrey. 

He said the new schemes are part of £24billion of investment in the road network by 2021 which will see spending tripled to £3billion each year on England’s key highways and motorways.

AA president Edmund King said; ‘This is a victory for common sense. We campaigned vigorously against the 60mph limit on motorways. Why go to all the trouble of widening the motorway and adding extra lanes if you are going to cut the speed limit and slow the traffic.’ 

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Smart motorways convert the hard shoulder to a running lane to boost capacity and smooth traffic, operating either permanently or during busy periods.

‘Overhead variable message signs inform motorists of changes in speed limits, queuing and lane closures, while staff in regional control centres use CCTV to monitor incidents and keep motorists safe.’ 

The schemes will boost capacity by a third and improve journey times by up to 10 per cent on the key stretches of the  M1 and 15 per cent on the M3, where average speeds are currently 45mph during rush-hour.

The DfT spokesman stressed: ‘The national speed limit on these sections will remain at 70 mph.‘He added: ‘Drivers should see an improvement in their journeys when the M1 schemes commence operation from autumn 2015, and when the M3 scheme opens to traffic in 2016.’ 

Mr McLoughln said: ‘Smart motorways are an effective and cost efficient way of increasing space on our roads, cutting jams and speeding up journey times and I am pleased to announce the start of work on these schemes.’
