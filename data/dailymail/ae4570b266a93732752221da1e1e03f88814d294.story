A former RAF control tower at the site where bomber pilots were trained during the Second World War as well as those taking part in the infamous Dambusters mission has been put up for sale for £300,000.

The four-storey 40ft  structure comes complete with military ancillary buildings at the former RAF Wainfleet base in Friskney, Lincolnshire.

However obtaining a slice of military history comes with a warning because visitors to the area are still warned about the danger of unexploded bombs nearby on the former training range.

The RAF control tower on the site where Dam Busters were trained, is to be sold at auction this month and has a guide price of £300,000

But estate agents, acting for the private seller, have confirmed that the risk of any unexploded bombs should not affect buyers, as missions generally took place over the wash, which goes in to the nearby sea and can be seen from the control tower.

For more than a century, members of the Armed Forces would hone their firing skills on the site of RAF Wainfleet which was used as a bombing range for pilots from just before the start of the Second World War. 

It was also used as a training ground for the famous Dambusters mission where the air force developed bouncing bombs that were used to successfully breach dams in Germany. The mission became so famous it has been made the subject of books and a film.

The historic air base dates back to the 1920s. The tower was built in the 1970s. 

After the site was closed in 2010  the equipment was removed from the seven-sided observation tower, which used to function as a weapons range.

The RAF Wainfleet website contains the warning: 'Although there is no risk from aircraft dropping bombs, there remains a significant risk from unexploded ordnance that may be exposed by the tides. Do not touch anything!!'

The RAF has previously warned about the danger of unexploded ordnance at the site, but there is only believed to be a risk in the wash

The control tower, which is over four storeys, boasts views of the countryside and the sea as well as the five bedrooms inside 

However potential customers are being told that they are unlikely to be at risk as the bombing range was over the wash, which goes out to sea. The tower itself is now surrounded by farmed fields.

The control tower, built in the 1970s, is spread over four storeys and boasts a kitchen, toilet, three lobbies and landings, and five other rooms, as well as the top floor observatory.

It comes with a sea view and also has a balcony and its own flag pole. 

The tower is located close to the coast, between Boston and Skegness. The marshy area around the base was first used by the military as for cannon and musket practice during the Napoleanic Wars of the early 1800s.

The Dam Busters managed to successfully attack Eder Dam, one of two dams which caused widespread destruction in Germany 

The control tower lies on the site where the Dambusters underwent their training, later told in the 1955 film of the same name

The tower comes with additional buildings - two have their own kitchen and toilet, and the workshop is steel clad with a roller shutter door. The five buildings were once used as a kitchen, rest room, gym, offices, workshop as well as a generator and oil tank.

Sellers say the former RAF weapons range, valued at £300,000, could be transformed into luxury  accommodation by its new owner in a Grand Designs-style makeover.

Bagshaws Residential estate agents will be auctioning off the property at Derbyshire County Cricket Club on November 26.

Simon Gillibrand, an auction partner at Bagshaws Residential, said: 'The views from the top floor are absolutely brilliant. You could have a wonderful lounge up there.

'I have been selling properties for over 30 years and I have never seen anything like this. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone.

'It's only been on the market for two or three weeks, but it has already had quite a lot of interest and the views from it are just stunning.

The mission became so well known it was developed into a successful film in 1955, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd

The Dambusters mission, which saw two dams in Germany breached and 1,600 people drowned, was made the subject of a film 

The 1955 film revealed the level of training Dambusters had to undergo for the mission, which has also been marked in a book

'This could end up being a bit of a Grand Designs property.

'Of course it will be up to the buyer to do what they want with the tower but it really is a unique property and a chance of owning a slice of British military history.'

It has been given a guide price of between £300,000 to £350,000 on property listings website Rightmove.

The listing on Rightmove.com describes the property as 'truly spectacular' with 'stunning views to all sides'.

It adds: 'Can only describe this rarest of opportunities to purchase the former RAF control tower and ancillary buildings and car park at Sea Lane, Friskney.

'Access over a private lane passing agricultural land opens onto the control tower which dominates the skyline.

'The secure compound surrounds this former bombing range control tower and ancillary buildings.'

RAF 617 Squadron was formed during the Second World War specifically to carry out 'bouncing bomb' attacks to breach dams in the industrial heartlands of Nazi Germany.

Between May 16-17 1943  the squadron targeted German dams with the bouncing bombs, becoming known as the Dam Busters.

Pilots risked their lives by flying across occupied Europe at night, so low that some were killed by power lines. The mission required precision and bravery as pilots were required to fly at just 60ft above the ground - compared to the normal 250ft planes must fly at now.

They had to drop untried bouncing bombs – with unprecedented accuracy – in full view of the enemy’s guns.

During this attack the Mohne and Edersee dams were breached, causing flooding of the Ruhr valley and villages in the Eder valley in Germany. 

Pilots also targeted the Sorpe dam but this did not collapse.  

Factories and mines were destroyed and an estimated 1,600 people drowned. 

Two hydroelectric power stations were also damaged. 

The operation was planned in secrecy and known as Chastise. 

It came at a great cost as 19 planes were lost, and 53 of the 133 men died in the raid

Barnes Wallis, an English scientist, inventor and engineer invented the bouncing bomb 

The Dam Busters became so notorious it led to a book and film being produced in 1955, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd.

The film Dambusters aimed to capture the action of Operation Chastise, which successfully breached two dams in Nazi Germany
