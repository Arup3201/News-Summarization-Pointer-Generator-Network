Former commander of the Royal Marines Major General Julian Thompson said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts

Britain would lose the Falklands if Argentina decided to invade according to one of the most distinguished commanders of the 1982 conflict. 

Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded the brigade of Royal Marines during the conflict, said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts, and it would be 'end of story' if Argentine forces took the British base on East Falkland.

He explained it has been left vulnerable because cost-cutting meant the Royal Navy did not have an aircraft carrier to defend the region.

He told The Times: 'The Argentines have a marine brigade. They've got a parachute brigade and some good special forces.'

'All they've got to do is get those guys
on to the islands for long enough to destroy the (RAF) Typhoon jets and
that's the end of it.

Uncertain: General Thompson said Britain's hold on the islands had been left vulnerable because cost-cutting meant the Royal Navy did not have an aircraft carrier to defend the region

Vulnerable: Gen Thompson said if the airfield was destroyed, the only option for Britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea, as Margaret Thatcher did in the 1980s

If the airfield was destroyed, the only option for Britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea, as Margaret Thatcher did in the 1980s.

She sent across HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes which were successful at keeping the enemy aircraft at bay, but now any task force would lack a carrier and jets.

General Thompson added: 'You have got to take your own air support with you and you can't without a carrier. End of story.'

In 1982, the Falklands Task Force had two aircraft carriers, but Britain's troubled and increasingly expensive plan to equip the navy with new aircraft carriers has been a well-documented struggle after ministers remain unsure about what jets will be able to launch from them.

The decision to scrap the Harrier fleet plan means that Britain will have no carrier aircraft capability between 2011 and 2020.

The next aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth will not be operational for another eight years.

This has worrying implications for Britain's capability as tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen.

It started to intensify since 2010, when oil exploration by British
companies off the islands raised the stakes.

General Thompson said he thought President Cristina Fernandez de 
Kirchner, left, was trying to force David Cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty

General Thompson said he believed President Cristina Fernandez de 
Kirchner was doing everything she could to force Mr Cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty, although the PM has refused to start with Argentina unless the 3,000 islanders want them.

Last month Downing Street accused 
Argentina of pursuing a 'policy of confrontation' over the islands, 
after reports suggested Argentina's industry minister called for all British imports to be banned.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office summoned an Argentinian envoy to London last week to explain the proposed ban as well as what happened when the South American state's government prevented two cruise ships from docking following a visit to the Falkland Islands last month.

Diplomatic tension: Relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen

Britain recently deployed one of its
most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, and although it 
insisted the move was merely routine, Argentina met with UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the president of the UN Security 
Council after accusing Britain of  'militarising the South Atlantic.'

The
Duke of Cambridge's arrival in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF 
search and rescue pilot was move which further infuriated Buenos Aires.

Argentina has received the backing of 
Latin American countries for its claim of sovereignty of the islands, which were occupied by Britain in 1833.

War of words: In January Argentines branded Prince William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland Islands, despite serving with an RAF Search and Rescue squadron rather than an armed unit

Trouble before he arrives: Prince Harry, will arrive in Rio on Friday on a two-day diplomatic offensive - he is currently in the Central American state of Belize, as part of a Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Caribbean and Brazil

At the weekend the leader of the Argentine community
warned that Argentine protestors demanding the return of the Falkland 
Islands are planning to disrupt Prince Harry's visit to Brazil later 
this week.

Oswaldo Sicardi, the president of Clube Argentino in Rio de Janeiro said
the prince's three day visit to the country was 'in extremely bad 
taste' just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the start of the 
Falklands War.

He called on Argentinians living in the city to 'show their anger' over 
the islands they call Las Malvinas by picketing the high profile visit.
