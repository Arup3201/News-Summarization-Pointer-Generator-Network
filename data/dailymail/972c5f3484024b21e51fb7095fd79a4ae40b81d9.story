Lord Monson has told of his fury after a Kenyan investigation ruled the country's police were not responsible for the death in custody of his son Alexander.

The British lord, 57, said it was 'ludicrous' that officers connected to the case had been cleared.He spoke out after the family was informed an internal investigation had ruled no officer was responsible for the death in May of former Marlborough College pupil Alexander Monson, 28.

The peer's son died in hospital in the port city of Mombasa on May 19 after he allegedly suffered serious head injuries following his arrest outside a nightclub.Lord Monson today called for a full murder investigation to be launched into the tragedy after a Kenyan CID probe cleared all police officers connected to the case.In a statement he said: 'The Criminal Investigation Department report into Alexander's death is plainly ludicrous.Â 

'If the son of a Kenyan official had died in such circumstances, we would not be where we are now.

'In the face of global scepticism about the credibility of the Kenyan police authorities, we stood back to allow Mr Mohamed Amin, Director of Criminal Investigations, to conduct a full and thorough investigation into Alexander's death.

'Yet his report states he has absolutely no idea how Alexander died.'

Lord Monson said the Kenyan police report confirmed the opinion of two pathologists that his son was killed by a blow to the head.

Alexander Monson had lived with relatives in Kenya for two years after graduating.

He was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences on May 19 outside a nightclub in the coastal resort of Diani and taken to a local police station, where the family claim he was subjected to a violent attack.

Mr Monson was taken to hospital hours later and died while handcuffed to a bed.

Several police officers from the station were temporarily moved to other duties pending a police probe into the tragedy.However Lord Monson today said the police investigation had offered no evidence on who was responsible for his son's death.

He said: 'Mr Amin's report concedes and reconfirms the pathologist's conclusion that Alexander was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and that the government analyst found no drugs in his body.'But it provides no information whatsoever on who was responsible for the fatal injury.'In fact, any detail at all is conspicuous by its absence, despite Mr Amin's claim to have interviewed and recorded statements from 26 witnesses.'Mr Amin even fails to mention that the pathology report stated Alexander had defensive wounds on his left forearm and severe swelling of the groin, injuries consistent with known police torture methods in Kenya.'Lord Monson said his family would fight to ensure his son's death was investigated as murder.The hereditary peer, who works as a journalist, flew to Kenya following the tragedy.In his latest statement he vowed the family would continue their fight despite the police report.He said: 'We have said from the very beginning that Alexander was brutally killed in police custody which is made perfectly clear by the two autopsy reports.'Mr Amin's report only serves to reinforce our view. And yet not a single arrest has been made.'We strongly disagree with Mr Amin's final statement that in his opinion "the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased (Alexander) can best be determined by a public inquest".'What must be conducted instead is a murder inquiry which must be opened immediately and the suspects who were responsible for Alexander at the time of his incarceration must be arrested, charged and tried in a court of law.'He added: 'This is a setback for us but it is not the end of the road.'We are confident that there are people of integrity and influence in Kenya who will help us get justice for Alexander.'If the Kenyan police authorities do not have the stomach to investigate themselves, the case should be handed to another body which does not have existing relationships with the culprits.'A body that is both independent and fearless in its pursuit of the law.'
