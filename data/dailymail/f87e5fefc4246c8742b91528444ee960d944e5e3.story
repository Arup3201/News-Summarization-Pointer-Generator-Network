Wanted: Police released this mugshot of Anthony Morrison when he was wanted for questioning about an armed robbery

A criminal who was hauled to court to face robbery charges after a two-month manhunt has walked free after a judge ruled the 'wanted' picture of him issued by police had contaminated evidence.

Detectives had released a mugshot of career criminal Anthony Morrison, 32, when he was wanting for questioning over a £20,000 robbery at an Adsa supermarket.

But witnesses due to testify against him at his trial told police they recognised his face after seeing the wanted picture - despite all the robbers wearing balaclavas during the raid.

On the first day of the planned trial, prosecutors said there was 'huge potential for contamination' in the evidence against him.

Apart from the eyewitnesses, whose identification of Morrison was 'contaminated', the only other evidence was that his DNA was found on a distinctive jacket linked to the robbery.

But prosecutors said there was no evidence that Morrison was wearing the jacket at the time of the attack, and he could have worn it previously.

Simon Parry, prosecuting told Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that he would offer no evidence against Morrison, adding: 'Suspicion isn't enough.'

Morrison, who had previously been jailed for six years for conspiracy to rob, was suspected of being one of four men armed with a sledgehammer and handgun who had attacked security guards filling ATM machines at Asda in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

One of the guards was punched twice in the face during the raid in 2011, while another heard one of the robbers shout 'Just shoot him'.

The thieves made off with a cash box containing £20,000. Suspects Jason Butterworth, 33, and Michael Ford, 34, were arrested but Morrison fled to Spain in December 2011.

The following July he called police from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam to say he wanted to give himself up.

Arrangements were made for him to board an aircraft to Manchester because officers were legally unable to go to Holland to escort him back to Britain.

Morrison agreed to be arrested by officers when he arrived at Manchester Airport but when he touched down at Terminal One from his EasyJet flight he fled before he got to passport control.

While officers were waiting in Terminal One,
he forced his way through a locked door into Terminal Three and 
disappeared into the crowd before escaping in a taxi.

It was then that police issued his mugshot in a wanted appeal.

They failed to track him down until 
nearly two months later, when he arrived at North Manchester General 
Hospital with a bullet wound to his chest.

Morrison staggered from the passenger 
seat of a BMW, which drove away as he was helped by paramedics outside 
the hospital on August 26 last year.

It is not known who shot him, why or where.

Speaking at court, prosecutor Mr Parry
said: 'Firstly, the main priority for everybody concerned is that they 
had to save his life. It wasn’t until later in the year that he was 
arrested.

'On November 12 last year he was 
arrested, answering “no comment” to questions. The only evidence in the 
robbery case centred around a very distinctive jacket that had his DNA 
on the collar.

'Initially the offenders were 
described as having their faces covered by balaclavas and the victims 
said they couldn’t identify the men due to this.

'But about a month before Morrison was
arrested, the victims said they had seen articles in the press and 
recognised him, despite the fact he wore a face covering.

'There is huge potential for 
contamination. Many articles said he was the man responsible for the 
robbery and then the victims gave a statement saying they recognised his
face only after his picture had been released.

'Aside from this identification, the 
only evidence is his DNA on the collar of the jacket. There is no doubt 
the offender wore that jacket. However our expert confirms that it is 
not possible to tell when that was.'

Mr Parry said Morrison was an 
acquaintance of those convicted of the robbery and said he went to the 
gym with Butterworth, so it was not possible to confirm when he had worn
the jacket.

That meant the only evidence was witnesses' identification of Morrison, which was 'contaminated.’

Mr Parry added: 'The prosecution 
aren’t confident relying on the evidence. There is an overwhelming 
likelihood that the identification is contaminated.

'His DNA is bound to be on the getaway
car as he goes to the gym with the other offender. He said he has been 
in the car plenty of times and he has worn that jacket and it is likely 
that he has.

'But can we say he was the last person
to wear it? No, we can’t. For that reason, I offer no evidence. 
Suspicion isn’t enough, your honour.'

Morrison's family smiled and gave the thumbs up as he was found not guilty by the judge.

Judge Jonathan Foster QC said: 'I 
don’t know enough about the case. It’s not for me as a judge to 
intervene or make any further comment.

'If there is not sufficient evidence to go before a jury, it would be wrong for that to now take place. That is my position.'

Defending Morrison, Imran Shafi said: 'It comes as no surprise that the prosecution have taken this view.'

Ford, of Middleton, was jailed for 
nine and a half years in August last year after pleading guilty to 
robbery. Butterworth, also of Middleton, was jailed for six years, eight
months.
