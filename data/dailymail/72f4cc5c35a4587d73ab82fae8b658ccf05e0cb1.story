An Illinois couple has turned their old horse barn into a six-acre dream home equipped with a gym, a pizza kitchen, a projection screen, and a fitness center.

Jeff and Lisa Edwards built a pole-barn for two horses and a colt, according to the Washington Times, but the family had so much fun visiting and staying in the family quarters that they decided there was only one thing to do: live there. 

Six years ago, the five-member family packed up and moved to the horse barn just three miles from Arcola, but not before making some much-needed renovations and additions.

The family gave the horses away because caring for them was too demanding and took time from family and other business, Lisa said.

What used to be the birthing room of the barn is now the Edwards' main kitchen, according to The News-Gazette. The Edwards' transformed the stalls into a living room and guest room. The master loft bedroom used to be the hay loft.

Jeff, acting as a general contractor, built two fire places in the 5,000-square-foot home that both burn wood.

'We don't have any gas out here. It's all electric,' Lisa said. 'We dug the pond and under it is our geo-thermal heating and cooling system. It's more energy-efficient.

Of the 5,000 square feet, 3,000 square feet of it is occupied by a full gymnasium. 

According to The Republic, the Edwards family is really into sports and the family even lets the Arcola Grade School's basketball, softball, and baseball teams practice in the gym when the school's is occupied.

The gymnasium also boasts a batting cage, a pizza kitchen, and a fitness center.

The Times reports that the Edwards' used the kitchen to entertain more than 30 relatives who came to the massive house for Thanksgiving. 

The couple hired someone to build the shell of the house and Jeff, along with a carpenter, finished the massive home, with the exception of heating, air-conditioning, and plumbing. 

The couple's oldest daughter, Cara, attends college and her younger sister, Taylor, is a senior in high school. Their youngest, Beau, is in the fifth grade, according to The Republican.

In the gymnasium, there is a large projection screen mounted on one wall  with large speakers on each side where the family can have a movie-theatre-like experience. 

Before moving into their dream home, the Edwards lived in a funeral home, renovated by Jeff, that the couple owned, according to the Gazette.

They lived on the top floor of the home until they moved into the massive house.

'We kind of outgrew the funeral home, living upstairs,' Lisa said. 'We were able to keep the girls quiet during visitations. 

But Beau still liked to run from one end to the other so we decided Beau would like to run here.
