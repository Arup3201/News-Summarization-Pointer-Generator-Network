Two women shamelessly brawled in broad daylight at traffic lights and then drove off as if nothing had happened.

Punches were thrown, harsh abuse exchanged and sunglasses sent flying in the shocking road rage incident between the two females, who appeared to be in their early 20s.

A driver  in the car behind the two vicious women captured the whole unbelievable stoush on her phone and then posted it on Facebook much to the amusement of more than 6,000 viewers.

'Casually waiting at the lights, and this happens! hahahahaha brawls on the streets of Wollongong' Makayla Van Eimeren says in the post about the fight that happened in Wollongong about 80km south of Sydney.

In the footage the blonde woman approached the brunette, who had just got out of the in car in front at the traffic lights, and they started arguing.

The blonde then made the fateful mistake of pushing the brunette, before opening her door to get back into her car, when the brunette - clearly not prepared to take it lying down - started hitting the blonde.

Clearly shocked, the blonde began to fight back while trying to protect herself as the brunette aggressively punched her in the head.

The fight bizarrely ends when both brawlers pick up their sunglasses and then casually start to walk off

The blonde's sunglasses went flying over her head and then she managed to pull the other woman's sunglasses off her face which bizarrely ended the fight.

Both women then proceeded to pick up their sunnies and the brunette pulled her dishevelled top back together.

Heated words continued to be exchanged as they walked alongside each other until the blonde got back in her car.

Insistent of having the last word, just before the brunette got back into her car she threateningly gestured by pointing to the blonde and then to her own throat.

Meanwhile, the traffic light remained green for the entire 40-second incident.
