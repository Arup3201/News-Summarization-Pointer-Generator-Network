Man bites dog: Ryan Wantenpaugh, 34, allegedly cooked his ex-girlfriends dog then fed it to her

A Northern California man has been arrested after his ex-girlfriend said he cooked her dog and fed it to her.

Ryan Watenpaugh, 34, of Palo Cedro was arrested on Thursday on charges of stalking and animal cruelty.

He remains jailed on Friday.

Watenpaugh's ex told police he had repeatedly struck her while they were dating and that after one assault, she left her Redding apartment and returned to find her Pomeranian, 'Bear,' missing.

USA Today reports that the woman said she suffers from bruises and minor cuts after the assaults and she claims that she was twice held against her will while she was trying to escape him.

Police say the couple briefly reconciled last week and Watenpaugh cooked the woman a meal and she ate it thinking it was like any other meal.

But she told police he later texted her and asked how her dog had tasted.

On Tuesday at around 1 a.m. the woman 
heard a truck pull up to her residence and she saw Watenpaugh walk to 
her house and place a mysterious object on her doorstep.

When she went outside, she saw two of the dog's paws outside her door.

Police say Watenpaugh has denied killing or cooking the dog.

In addition to arresting Wantenpaugh, police searched his home and found AK-47 assault rifle and multiple high-capacity magazines.

He was booked for animal cruelty, domestic violence, stalking and false imprisonment. He's being held on $250,000 bail.
