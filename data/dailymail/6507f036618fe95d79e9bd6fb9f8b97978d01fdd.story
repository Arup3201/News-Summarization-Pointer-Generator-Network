A baby who suffered a massive bleed during a complicated heart operation was saved after she had 30 blood transfusions.

Ava Hope Hughes was given pint after pint of blood over a 12-hour period as doctors battled to save her life following the surgery to help correct a rare heart defect.

Her mother Vicky Hughes, 33, could only look on helplessly as her desperately ill eight-month-old daughter fought for her life in hospital.

A little fighter: Ava Hope Hughes, with her mother Vicky, who was saved by over 30 transfusions

But yesterday Ava was recovering at 
home with her family as her mother thanked all the blood donors who had 
helped to keep her baby alive.

Mrs Hughes said: ‘That blood saved my 
daughter’s life. She had 30 blood transfusions in 12 hours. If the blood
was not there in that hospital at that time she would not have 
survived.’

She said the doctors at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in 
Liverpool did an incredible job in repairing the bleed in Ava’s heart 
and never once gave up.

She said: ‘I’m just so grateful, I 
want everyone to give blood. I will forever be in the debt of Alder 
Hey.’

For-Ava Hope-ful: When Vicky, with Ava as a newborn, was pregnant she was told her daughter might not survive childbirth

Ava suffers from hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) which 
means she only has half a heart. Her condition was first spotted in the 
womb.

Doctors warned her mother that Ava 
might die during childbirth – or if she lived, it might not be for long 
due to the massive defect.

Mummy's little fighter: Ava Hope has a congenital heart defect

But they hadn’t reckoned on Ava’s sheer will 
to live and have described her as a ‘survivor’ and a ‘tough cookie’.

After an initial operation in which 
she suffered the dangerous bleed Ava had to undergo more surgery at the 
hospital.

Now she is doing well, although she will need at least one 
more operation to make sure that her one good ventricle does the work 
normally done by two.

HLHS is a congenital defect in which the left ventricle of the heart is severely underdeveloped.

Infants with the condition have a 40 
per cent chance of surviving into adulthood and may experience chronic 
health problems for the rest of their lives.

Mrs Hughes from West Derby,
Liverpool, who wants to encourage people to sign the blood donor 
register at www.blood.co.uk and to give blood whenever they are able, 
said: ‘I know Ava faces a hard fight, but each day she’s getting 
stronger and better.

'She just doesn’t give up. She’s a little fighter.’
