A judge has set aside an elderly woman’s will because of pressure applied by her ‘forceful’ son.

Two years before she died aged 98, Jessica Schrader, changed her will from leaving her house to her two sons to leaving it just to one of them.

The will she wrote in 2006 superseded one she had written in 1990, in which she left her Essex farmhouse to be shared equally between her sons Nick Schrader, now 62, and Bill Schrader, now 60.

Today, a judge at London's High Court pronounced in favour of the 1990 will, saying that the 'violent' and 'irrational' older brother had used 'undue influence' on his mother to get her to make the second will in which she left the whole house to him.

Farmer's son Bill Schrader, 60, had challenged the new will on the basis that his mother did not have proper capacity, did not know what she was doing and was improperly influenced to leave Southend Farm House, near Billericay, to his older brother.

After a four-day hearing, Mr Justice Mann pronounced in favour of the 1990 will, restoring the younger brother’s half-share of the value of the house - worth about £160,000.

He also ordered Nick Schrader to pay the costs of the 'regrettable' action, estimated at around £110,000.

Today, the judge said that the brothers were at such loggerheads that Nick Schrader felt 'hatred' towards Bill Schrader, who ran a car-breaking business on land next to the house.  He said that he younger did not seem to feel quite as strongly.

The court heard that part of the explanation might be Nick Schrader's view - denied by his younger brother - that Bill Schrader had an affair with his brother’s first wife and behaved inappropriately, stopping short of a full affair, with his second.

The judge said: 'He [Nick Schrader] is, in my view, somewhat obsessed with his feelings towards his brother and a feeling that they were treated unequally by their parents throughout their lives.

'As far as I can see this perception of inequality is unjustified.

'What has happened is that Nick has made different life choices and different choices towards the acquisition of cash as opposed to land.'

Nick Schrader was also a man 'of violent character' who received a prison sentence for assaulting the partner of his former wife at a wedding in 2004, said the judge.

He had also shoved shears through an open car window towards his brother’s head or neck, though he did not make contact, and been verbally abusive to customers visiting Bill Schrader’s vehicle repair business.

'His behaviour was bad verging on the irrational on a very significant number of occasions,' the judge added.

The judge said that Jessica Schrader was remarkably alert and active until becoming frail after a fall in May 2005.

But she still understood the world, and the people around her, and clearly had testamentary capacity and understood the will.

However, undue influence on the part of Nick Schrader, who gave up his job to move in to look after his mother, was established, he added.

In pronouncing against the 2006 will and in favour of the 1990 version, Nick Schrader’s personality was an important factor, said the judge.

'He was a forceful man with a forceful physical presence. I repeat that I find there was no question of physical abuse, or even of real emotional abuse.

'I am sure that he will have experienced frustrations in looking after his elderly mother which many less volatile personalities will experience.  However, the fact is he was a powerful personality and his mother was much more vulnerable.

'Nick’s keenly felt view that he had not been treated equally with his brother is an important point.

'He would be more inclined to try to even things up. I think that he did so, by way of suggestion to his mother.

'He had clear views about his entitlement to his "inheritance".'

The judge also said that Nick Schrader was instrumental in sowing in his mother’s mind the desirability of his having the house, and in doing so he took advantage of her vulnerability.

He added: 'It is not possible to determine any more than that the precise form of the pressure, or its occasion or occasions, but it is not necessary to do so.

'I am satisfied that this will results from some form of undue influence.'

The farmhouse will now be sold and the older brother's share is expected to be swallowed up in the costs of the legal action.
