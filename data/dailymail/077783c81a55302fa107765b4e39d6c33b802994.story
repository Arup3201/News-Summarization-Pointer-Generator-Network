A man accused of murdering his 6-year-old daughter blew a kiss to the girl’s mother as he was remanded in custody today.

She was seen to return the gesture.

Jenny Gray, the mother of murdered 6-year-old Ellie blew a kiss to her boyfriend Ben Butler, the child's father, as he was taken to the cells at the Old Bailey this morning

Ben Butler, 34, was refused bail at a 
hearing at the Old Bailey, a day after he was charged with the murder of
 his daughter, Ellie.

The child died from head injuries after being found collapsed at their home in Westover Close, on the Shanklin Estate, Sutton, Surrey, on October 28 last year.

Dressed in a grey suit, a white shirt
 and tieless, Mr Butler blew a kiss to Jennie Gray, Ellie’s 34-year-old artist mother, as 
he was led from the dock by guards. She reciprocated.

Mr Butler will next appear at the court on May 29 to enter a plea.

Reporting restrictions were put in place at Croydon Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday that had prevented the identification of Mr Butler and Ellie.

The restriction was lifted for the Old Bailey hearing after the Butlers' local newspaper Sutton Guardian successfully challenged it.
