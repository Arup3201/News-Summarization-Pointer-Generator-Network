At 24 he reportedly negotiated a $1 million salary from the man who inspired Michael Douglas' Wall Street character Gordon Gekko.

Last year he took home $250 million.

And earlier this month he splashed $147 million for a vacation home, which happened to be the costliest private residence ever sold in the United States.

Meet Barry Rosenstein, the 54-year-old New York financier whose personal wealth is estimated at $1.3 billion, according to Forbes.

A portrait of the hedge funder has been painted in House Of Outrageous Fortune, a book about 15 Central Park West by Michael Gross.

From above-average beginnings in West Orange, Rosenstein is the middle child of a tax accountant and was suspended from high school for spray painting the basketball coach's garage, according to The New York Post.

Rosenstein is the middle child of a tax accountant from West Orange, NJ. He was suspended from high school for spray-painting the basketball coach's garage.

After studying accounting at Lehigh University, Rosenstein got an MBA at Wharton and went to work for Merrill Lynch where, as legend has it, he talked his way into $1 million a year from Asher Edelman, the man who supposedly inspired Gordon Gekko.

Edelman has said that the figure was closer to $100,000.

In 1986, Rosenstein married his wife, Lizanne, at The Plaza, and are still together today.

In 1992 he was seriously injured a wind surfing accident.

Ignoring advice by doctors to have surgery, Rosenstein turned to yoga to fix his injuries, and now starts every day with a long session.

Rosenstein has four children with his wife and, in 2001, when Rosenstein decided to start his own hedge fund, he used their initials in naming it JANA.

In 2004, when JANA's assets hit $2 billion, the head of a data-processing company accused it of spreading lies about the firm.

The next year, Kerr-McGee, an Oklahoma oil company, sued Rosenstein as well as Carl Icahn, who had joined JANA in a proxy fight.

Kerr-McGee accused them of violating a federal law requiring disclosure of an investment.

Between 2003 and 2006, JANA earned annual returns of more than 30 percent.

With the proceeds of these deals, Rosenstein bought a $29 million duplex apartment in one of the city's most exclusive addresses, 15 Central Park West, then spent millions on rennovations, including a yoga studio with a heated wooden floor.

Then there is 18-acre beachfront property in East 
Hampton that he bought for a staggering $147million, which smashed the previous record of 
$120 million paid for a Greenwich, Connecticut home last month

Jerry Seinfeld and many other power brokers are among the financier’s newest neighbors, and the property features an elaborate garden and a pond with bridges.

The massive estate was the dream home of Christopher H. Browne, the former managing director of the Tweedy, Browne Company investment firm – he died December 2009 at age 62 from a heart attack.

Browne left the home to architect Andrew Gordon, his partner of 10 years, sources said.

The will was contested by a dozen of the deceased investment guru’s relatives, but Gordon remained in the home after reaching a settlement three years after Browne’s death.

Gordon was battling cancer at the time and died last September at age 52, the paper said.

The property then reverted back to Browne’s family, and they immediately put it on the market.

It was sold to an unidentified person in a direct transaction that avoided paying hefty broker commissions.

‘Somehow, someone got the inside track. All the brokers are crestfallen,’ said another person.

Rosenstein is now said to be hunting for another New York home, with a budget of $60 million.
