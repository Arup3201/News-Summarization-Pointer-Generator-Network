Three planeloads of Americans have been evacuated from a major Iraqi air base north of Baghdad as Al Qaeda-aligned militants have toppled cities in the country's north and threaten to advance toward Baghdad.

The planes, loaded with diplomats and contractors stationed at an Iraqi airbase in Balad, flew out amid fears that the base could be surrounded by the militants.

The passengers included 12 U.S. government officials and military personnel who have been training Iraqi forces to use fighter jets and surveillance drones.

The jihadist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has seized a large swathe of northern Iraq, including second city Mosul, and they threaten to advance toward Baghdad

The evacuation means that the training mission at Balad has been grounded indefinitely - despite repeated statements from the Obama administration that it would continue to support Iraq's military.

Several hundred American contractors are still waiting to leave, although the State Department said on Thursday that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad continues to operate as usual.

The development signals the worsening security environment in the northern part of the country.

A senior intelligence source told Fox 
News there is serious concern about how to evacuate other Americans out 
of Iraq if the situation further deteriorates.

Obama said on Thursday that it was clear Iraq needs additional assistance from the U.S. and international community given the lightning gains by the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Levant

The
 source said 'all western diplomats in Iraq are in trouble,' and 
American allies are scrambling to put together an evacuation plan. 
Military officials said there are 'not a lot of good options.'

Other U.S. contractors are at a tank 
training ground in the city of Taji, just north of the capital, that is 
still in operation for now.

The
 militants, who operate under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq 
and al-Shams, have issued threats to anybody who defied a harsh code of 
Sharia they have imposed in captured territories.

Less than three years after pulling American forces out of Iraq, President Barack Obama is now weighing a range of short-term military options, including airstrikes, to quell an al-Qaida inspired insurgency that has captured two Iraqi cities and threatened to press toward Baghdad.

‘We do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold,’ Obama said on Thursday in the Oval Office.

However, officials firmly ruled out putting American troops back on the ground in Iraq, which has faced resurgent violence since the U.S. military withdrew in late 2011.

Obama, in his first comments on the deteriorating situation, said it was clear Iraq needed additional assistance from the U.S. and international community given the lightning gains by the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Levant.

'What we've seen over the last couple of days indicates Iraq’s going to need more help' from the United States and other nations, Obama said in the Oval Office.

He added that the U.S. has been working 'around the clock' to find appropriate ways to intervene.

'I don't rule out anything.' he said, because we do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in Iraq – or Syria, for that matter.

In his briefing with reporters, White House Press Secretary cautioned that Obama was 'responding to a question about airstrikes – or, would he consider airstrikes – and that's what he meant.'

'We're not considering boots on the ground,' he added later.

Obama, however, also said that 'it's fair to say that in our consultations with Iraqis, there will be some short term immediate things that need to be done militarily, and, you know, our national security team is looking at all the options.'

Republican lawmakers pinned some of the blame for the escalating violence on Obama's reluctance to re-engage in a conflict he long opposed.

For more than a year, the Iraqi government has been pleading with the U.S. for additional help to combat the insurgency, which has been fueled by the civil war in neighboring Syria.

Northern Iraq has become a way station for insurgents who routinely travel between the two countries and are spreading the Syrian war's violence.

Iraqi leaders made a fresh request earlier this week, asking for a mix of drones and manned aircraft that could be used for both surveillance and active missions.

Officials said Obama was considering those requests and was expected to decide on a course of action within a few days.

The U.S. already is flying unmanned aircraft over Iraq for intelligence purposes, an official said.

Short of airstrikes, the president could step up the flow of military assistance to the beleaguered Iraqi government, increase training exercises for the country's security forces and help boost Iraq's intelligence capabilities.

The U.S. has been leery of its lethal aid falling into the hands of militants or being otherwise misused.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. is sending about $12 million in humanitarian aid to help nearly a million Iraqis who have been forced from their homes by recent fighting.

Obama huddled with his national security team on Thursday to discuss the deteriorating security situation. And Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to underscore that while the U.S. stands ready to help, it would be crucial for Iraq to come up with longer-term solutions to its internal political strife.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has accused the president of 'taking a nap' while conditions worsened in Iraq

Nearly all American troops left Iraq in December 2011 after Washington and Baghdad failed to negotiate a security agreement that would have kept a limited number of U.S. forces in the country for a few more years at least.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a frequent White House critic, called on Thursday for Obama's entire national security team to resign. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused the president of ‘taking a nap’ while conditions worsened.

But Congress appeared divided over how to respond, with some Republicans backing airstrikes and other lawmakers from both parties suggesting that was the wrong approach.

There were no calls for putting American troops back on the ground in Iraq, and Obama's advisers said the president had no desire to plunge the U.S. back into a conflict there.

‘The president is mindful that the United States has sacrificed a lot in Iraq and we need to not just be taking this all back on ourselves,’ said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser.

‘We need to come up with solutions that can enable the Iraqis to manage their internal security and their internal politics.’

Even after American troops left Iraq, the U.S. has continued to send weapons and ammunition - although not nearly as much as Baghdad has requested.

A U.S. training mission for Iraqi counterterror forces dwindled to almost nothing earlier this year, and Baghdad asked as early as last summer for armed U.S. drones to track and strike terrorist hideouts.

The administration resisted, and similarly rejected options for airstrikes in neighboring Syria.

Instead, the U.S. Embassy has sold small scout helicopters, tanks, guns, rockets and at least 300 Hellfire missiles to Iraqi forces.

A U.S. shipment of ScanEagle surveillance drones is to be delivered to Iraq later this summer, and the State Department is trying to speed an order of Apache helicopters to Baghdad.

Additionally, Congress is reviewing a $1 billion order of arms, including Humvee vehicles, to Iraq.

The Islamic State, whose Sunni fighters have captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, aims to create an Islamic emirate spanning both sides of the border.

It has pushed deep into parts of Iraq's Sunni heartland once controlled by U.S. forces because police and military forces melted away after relatively brief clashes, including in Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul.

Skirmishes continued in several areas. Two communities near Tikirt - the key oil refining center of Beiji and the city of Samarra, home to a prominent Shiite shrine - remained in government hands, according to Iraqi intelligence officials.

The price of oil jumped to above $106 a barrel as the insurgency raised the risk of disruptions to supplies.

In its statement, the Islamic State declared it would start implementing its strict version of Shariah law in Mosul and other regions it had overrun.

The militants, who operate under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams, have issued threats to anybody who defied a harsh code of Sharia they have imposed in captured territories

It said women should stay in their homes for modesty reasons, warned it would cut off the hands of thieves, and told residents to attend daily prayers. It said Sunnis in the military and police should abandon their posts and 'repent' or else 'face only death.'

The Islamic State's spokesman vowed to take the fight into Baghdad. In a sign of the group's confidence, he even boasted that its fighters will take the southern Shiite cities of Karbala and Najaf, which hold two of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims.

'We will march toward Baghdad because we have an account to settle there,' he said in an audio recording posted on militant websites commonly used by the group.

The statement could not be independently verified.
