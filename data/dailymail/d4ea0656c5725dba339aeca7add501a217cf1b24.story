A toddler whose feet were amputated after her father accidentally backed over her with a lawnmower in a horrific accident in April took her first steps on her new prosthetic test legs on Monday.

Two-year-old Ireland Nugent has been in a wheelchair and undergone seven surgeries since the April 11 event. She was released from hospital in Tampa at the start of May.

Nugent was fitted with her new legs Monday and promptly took off walking as soon as they were on and there were emotional scenes after the five-hour fitting procedure.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that her father was tearful as he recorded her first steps on his iPad. 'I'm just speechless and so proud,' said Jerry Nugent.

He also referred to the toddler's determination and bravery in recovering from her injuries.  'She took it over the top ... She's not ever going to hold back.

'That's my superhero. That's my angel,' Nugent added.

The little girl was injured April 
11th when she ran after Jerry as he rode a lawn 
mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home.

Emotional: 'That's my superhero. That's my angel,' said the toddler's father

Her mother, Nicole 
Nugent, frantically motioned for him to stop, but he misunderstood, put 
the lawn mower in reverse and backed over the child.

The toddler's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb.

Experts were worried that the little girl might refuse to walk with her new prosthetic limbs, but the Tampa Bay Times reported that the girl has already become emotionally attached to the legs.

When the prosthetist said he would need the test limbs back, the little girl said she wanted to keep them.

Ireland will get to practice with the test legs on Monday night in the hotel room before receiving her finished prosthetics Tuesday.

Little Ireland was brimming with joy when she left hospital in May, donning a fancy yellow dress and hot pink sunglasses as her
father wheeled her out from the premises.

Her parents said the toddler 
was giggling with excitement as she left the facility and couldn't wait 
to join her sisters at home. 

'We're very excited to be back with the girls and the other kids and our family. A little nervous trying to figure out how everything's going to work.

'But I know we can do it. If we can do this, we can do anything,' the child's mother, Nicole, told the Tampa Bay Times.

The shocking case garnered national attention and photos of Ireland's bright smile warmed the hearts of thousands who followed her progress.

In the days immediately after her 
terrible accident, Ireland's parents were adamant that she would make as
full as a recovery as possible.

'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' her mother Nicole told reporters at a press conference in April. 'This will not stop Ireland.'

Ireland's family has banded together in the face of the terrifying ordeal.

Recovery: Ireland has suffered a setback during her recovery, including a dangerous infection. But doctors say she is making progress and can return home

Family: The little girl was injured April 11 when she ran after her father, Jerry Nugent, as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway of their home. Her mother, Nicole Nugent (pictured left), frantically motioned for him to stop

Police said the father was going to park the mower into
the garage at the family's Palm Harbor, Florida home in April.

He is said to 
have not noticed that his daughter had tripped behind the machine, and 
he only realized that something may be wrong when he saw his wife was 
alerting him that he was about to drive over something.

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the man responded by putting the mower in reverse, running over his daughter.

According
to police, the father dragged the little girl down the driveway of 
their subdivision and onto the street before he realized what had 
happened.

Too late: Police said her father swaddled her with a blanket and immediately called 911

Once he did, Mr Nugent immediately turned off the mower, and the woman called 911.

Authorities say the child's feet were severed above the ankles. Her left hand was injured but intact.

Her mother told a
group of reporters in April that their neighbors have banded 
together and begun raising funds so that the Nugents will be able to pay
for prosthetic limbs for Ireland.

'Never in my life did I think this would happen to my child,' Mrs Nugent said according to NBC News.
