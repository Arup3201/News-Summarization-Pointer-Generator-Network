Lee Daniels' The Butler, starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, brought together over 40 people in order to make the film come true.

The independent flick, which opens this week, would never have happened unless a Ukrainian born billionaire, ex-NBA star and some of the top African-American entrepreneurs had gotten together to raise the $30million budget.

The film tells the true story of Eugene Allen, the White House’s butler for over 30 years, who served eight U.S. presidents.

Indie project: The Butler, starring Oprah Winfrey and Forest Whitaker was funded with the help of a host of stars and prominent entrepreneurs who came up with the $30million budget

The film credits 41 producers and executive producers, who joined forces to cover the budget for the independent film.

Lee Daniels’ The Butler boasts a star-studded cast – the lead roles are played by Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey and includes Jane Fonda and Alan Rickman as Nancy and Ronald Reagan.

Forest Whitaker portrays butler Cecil Gaines who served eight different US presidents, while Oprah Winfrey stars as his proud but sometimes conflicted wife.

'He [Eugene Allen] served eight presidents and saw the movement of the country,’ the lead actor said at the film’s red carpet premiere this week.

The Butler: Forest Whitaker's character Cecil Gaines is based on Eugene Allen who served in the White House for 34 years

‘What's interesting is that he saw the civil rights act and then goes home and experiences it in his life.

'You get to emotionally to feel what it was like through him, so I think it's a very special film for that reason.'

Producers Laura Ziskin, who passed 
away in 2011, and Pam Williams began their hunt for support with Sheila 
Johnson, the first African-American female to have an ownership stake in
 three pro sports teams, two basketball and one ice hockey and CEO of a 
luxury property management company.

After reading the script for The Butler she signed on as an executive producer and donated $2.7million

‘I read it, and then I read it again. I called them and said, “This movie has to be made,”’ Ms Johnson told The Hollywood Reporter.

‘In Hollywood, no one wants to step up to the plate to support African-American films.’

Backer: Harvey Weinstein's Weinstein Co. bought the U.S. distribution rights of Lee Daniels' The Butler and the film is already hot on the Oscars tip-list

Getting personally involved in raising
 funds for the indie film, Ms Johnson was able to add entrepreneur Earl 
W. Stafford and the Harry I. Martin Jr., the president of the firm which
 provides IT services to the U.S. Government.

In 2012, Ukrainian-born billionaire 
Len Blavatnik's Icon U.K. provided  a $6 million guarantee against 
foreign presales , which saw him listed as an executive producer.

Shortly after this ex-NBA star Michael
 Finley followed and the project caught the attention of entertainment 
mogul Harvey Weinstein, who bought the U.S. distribution rights of the 
film.

‘It's a huge achievement,' says Weinstein Co. COO David Glasser told The Hollywood Reporter.

‘This is not your typical independent 
movie. It's spectacular how fierce these investors were in their quest 
to get this movie made. Harvey and I love it when a group of unknown 
people come together like this.’

Lee Daniels’ The Butler opens in U.S. cinemas on August 16.
