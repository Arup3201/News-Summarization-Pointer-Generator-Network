A man who was adrift on an inflatable dinghy for five days and then stranded on a small, uninhabited island in The Bahamas has been rescued.

A Coast Guard patrol spotted Larry Sutterfield on Cay Sal Bank, in the Western Bahamas between Cuba and Florida.

Video shot by the rescue crew showed the 39-year-old emerging from a small tent on the island and waving frantically to attract their attention.

Petty Officer John-Paul Rios, a Coast Guard spokesman, said Sutterfield had set out from Marathon in the Florida Keys on a camping trip when he was pulled out to sea. 

Mr Rios said: 'He had intended to go camping and he drifted from beneath the bridge in Marathon out to sea,' the Sun Sentinel reported.

'One of our routine law enforcement patrols flew over the uninhabited island and saw a fire.'

Upon closer inspection, they detected a small tent, before Sutterfield himself emerged and began waving his arms.

Further footage released by the Coast Guard showed him collecting a parcel from the shore.

Rios added: 'We dropped a radio and food and water, and he told us what happened.' 

Sutterfield, who is originally from Illinois, had not been reported missing. He had been on Cay Sal Bank for about a day after having spent nearly a week adrift.

The Coast Guard took him to back to the Florida Keys for medical treatment but he had no serious injuries.
