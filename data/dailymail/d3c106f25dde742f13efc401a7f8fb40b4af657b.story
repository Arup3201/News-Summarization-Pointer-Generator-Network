Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison Wednesday for illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items, the judge scolding the son of the famed civil rights leader for using the money as a 'piggy bank' and sentencing his wife to a year as well.

However, Jackson, who emotionally apologized to his father, mother, congressional colleagues and others, was given significantly less prison time than federal guidelines recommend, recognized by the judge as a 'complex person' who has done both good and bad.

Sandra Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns.

After prison, the former congressman 
is to spend three years on supervised release and complete 500 hours of 
community service. If he earns credit for good behavior in prison, he 
could end up serving closer to two years. He agreed to repay the 
$750,000 when he pleaded guilty earlier this year.

According
 to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TV's, 
restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items.

Jackson,
 48, had been a Democratic congressman from Illinois from 1995 until he 
resigned last November. In an emotional speech to the judge, he choked 
up and used tissues to blow his nose. He apologized and said he wanted 
to 'take responsibility for my actions.'

'I
 misled the American people. I misled the House of Representatives. I 
misled the Federal Election Commission,' he said. 'I was wrong.'

'I also want to apologize to my dad and to my mother,' Jackson added, stopping to compose himself.

The
 elder Jackson, who sat in the front row during the proceedings, told a 
crush of reporters outside the courthouse later: 'This has been an 
extraordinarily difficult time for our family.'

In
 court, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recognized Jackson Jr.'s 
public service on issues such as public education and clean water. 
'That's what makes this situation so tragic,' she said.

The one-time power couple misused $750,000 in campaign money on everything from a gold-plated Rolex watch and mink capes to vacations and mounted elk heads

But
 the judge said that if she gave him no jail time it would send a 
message that there are two systems: one for the well-connected and one 
for everyone else.

'I cannot
 do it. I will not do it,' she said, adding that as a public official, 
Jackson was expected to 'live up to a higher standard of ethics and 
integrity.' She also said that Jackson's actions could not be excused 
because of mental illness. He has been treated for bipolar disorder.

Federal
 sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 46 to 57 months — or 
just under four years to just under five years. The government had 
recommended four years, while Jackson's lawyers had asked that his 
sentenced be limited to 18 months.

Jackson's lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said the case lacked the typical victim found in most criminal cases.

'There are not widows and orphans surrounding the courtroom wanting his head,' Weingarten said.

But prosecutor Matt Graves said the crime was serious: 'These were extreme abuses,' he said.

Sandra
 Jackson will be permitted to serve her sentence after her husband 
completes his. The couple, who have two children, 13 and 9, asked to 
serve at separate times.

'I 
stand before you today asking for mercy,' Sandra Jackson said. 'My heart
 breaks every day with the pain that it's caused my babies.'

Her
 lawyer, Dan Webb, tried to persuade the judge to spare his client jail 
time, arguing that it would be an 'unbearable burden' on the children. 
But the judge old Mrs. Jackson, 'It is not the court that put your 
children in this position.'

Having
 their mother gone will be difficult for the children, the judge said, 
but 'it is survivable.' She said, 'Today you have to be held out as an 
example.'

Sandra Jackson 
also was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service and pay 
restitution of $22,000 — the amount of money she took from her 
alderman's campaign account for personal use.

The Jacksons, who pleaded guilty in February, entered the courtroom holding hands.

The judge said Jesse Jackson's reporting date for prison would be on or after Nov. 1.

As
 he got into his SUV to leave, Jackson said, 'I still believe in the 
power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I 
manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the errors of my ways— 
and I still believe in the resurrection.'

The
 former congressman's father sat in the front row during the 
proceedings, surveying the courtroom and writing notes on a piece of 
paper while waiting for the hearing to start. During a break just before
 the sentences were announced, he walked over to the defense table and 
sat down next to his son, who slouched in his chair. Weingarten soon 
joined them, and the younger Jackson was able to manage a laugh at 
something one of the other men said.

After the sentencing, the senior Jackson walked over to the prosecution table and shook hands with the prosecutors.

Weingarten
 told reporters that his camp was satisfied with the court's rulings 
'but nobody's celebrating today, obviously.' He said Jackson had 
suffered a 'fall from grace. ... It's a huge day of sadness.'
