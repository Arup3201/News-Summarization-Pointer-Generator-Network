Many women say white wine in particular sends them 'crazy' or makes them irrationally upset 

There was a time when an evening with friends was synonymous with a nice, chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (or four).

But as the years have rolled by, that crisp, glass of gooseberry-flavoured nectar has fallen out of favour.

'No white wine for me - it sends me mental,' is how it started. 'Nor me,' said another friend, and on it went.

In fact, over the last few years, nearly a dozen of my female friends have declared they can no longer drink what used to be our favourite tipple.

One was almost arrested, another broke her wrist and another very nearly got run over.

There are countless other tales of tears, tantrums and Tube journeys going disastrously wrong.  

But what is it about the drink of choice for so many women that sends them doolally - or 'psychotic', as one friend confessed?

Is there something in the wine itself or is it the way we consume it that wreaks such havoc? 

Firstly, different people react to alcohol in very different ways, Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to the charity Drinkaware. 

'Women react more quickly to alcohol,' she explained. 'If you’re a sturdy woman, you might think you can drink any scrawny man under the table - but don’t be fooled.

'Even if a woman is the same size as a man, she will have more body fat and less body water.

'Since alcohol is only distributed in body water, you’ll have a higher proportion of it in your bloodstream.’

This, she says, may be why women tend to suffer from worse hangovers.

Indeed, researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbi found that not only do women get drunk faster, but their hangover symptoms were more severe - even though they drank the same amount as the men. 

Then there's eating on on an empty (or at least emptier than many a man's) stomach, which one study likened to taking alcohol intravenously. 

'Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach means the alcohol is absorbed into your system quicker,' said Dr Jarvis.

But what does seem to be key in the white wine situation is the speed at which it is drunk - and the volume of alcohol it contains.

Both Dr Jarvis, and Dr Arun Ghosh, a GP at the Spire Liverpool Hospital and ITV's resident doctor, agree that women tend to drink more quickly. 

'White wine is a female drink - more women drink white wine even than red wine,' Dr Ghosh told MailOnline.

'If a woman orders a large 250ml glass, that's a third of a bottle of, say, 13 per cent alcohol. And she can often drink that a lot quicker than a man drinking a pint (568ml) - which is also weaker in terms of volume of alcohol.

'Whereas a man might take 30 minutes to drink a pint (which contains on average two units of alcohol), some women will drink a glass of wine (which could be up to three units) in 10-15 minutes,' he added. 

'The strength of wine has also increased,' GP Arun Ghosh told MaiOnline. Experts advise those who are worried about their consumption - and the effects - to cut down on glass size and the alcohol volume of wine

The effects of too much alcohol also manifest themselves in different ways.  

'Men tend to get more aggressive as they have more testosterone - but for women, alcohol can be more of a depressant, so they may cry.

'However things are changing and young women are becoming equally as violent as men,' he added. 

While there appears to be no published research - or evidence - that white wine per se is the culprit for so many women becoming so intoxicated, theories abound.

One is that white wine contains more sulphites than red wine.

While sulphites are naturally found on grapes, small amounts of sulphur are added prior to fermentation as a preservative to keep the freshness and remove unwanted yeasts and bacteria.

However sulphites have been linked - anecdotally, at least -  with 'drinking blues' and depression, as well as a host of other ailments from allergies to headaches.

White wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red, according to the Food Standards Agency.

A large glass of 13% wine puts a woman over the government's lower risk guidelines. 

Another small glass (125ml) will put men over the guidelines too. 

Wine is often consumed at dinner time alongside a meal but did you know that a large glass of 13% wine (250ml) can add 228 calories to your evening supper?

This is similar to a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers. 

A standard glass of 13% red or white wine (175ml)   could also contain up to 160 calories which is similar to a slice of Madeira cake.

Often when sharing wine, we assume we’re drinking less calories but a bottle of wine shared between two could mean you are consuming 340 calories each - that’s the equivalent of a pain au chocolat pastry each.

Whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml, rose contains 2.5g per 100ml. Meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml. 

While there is no published evidence to prove a link between higher sugar alcohol and more boisterous behaviour, there is a wealth of research proving sugar can dramatically affect behaviour.  

'The strength of wine has also increased, without a doubt,' said Dr Ghosh. 

Plus, women in particular are more likely to 'overpour', according Drinkaware, which warns many of us have no idea how much we're glugging from the glass. 

For example, a large (250ml) glass of 13 per cent wine puts a woman over the government's lower risk guidelines for alcohol consumption.

It also contains up to 228 calories - similar to a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers.  

Elsewhere, it has been suggested that white wine is simply more 'drinkable' - i.e. we drink it faster and end up consuming more. 

Then there's the bubbles in drinks such as champagne or prosecco. 

'The carbon dioxide makes the body absorb alcohol more quickly - which in turn makes you drunk more quickly,' said Dr Ghosh. 

There is some evidence that bubbly drinks intoxicate you more quickly than flat drinks.

A study at the University of Surrey in 2001 found volunteers given two glasses of fizzy champagne had an average of 0.54 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood after five minutes, while those given the same amount of flat champagne had 0.39 milligrams.

One theory is the carbon dioxide in bubbles speeds up the flow of alcohol into the intestine.

Indeed, turning your wine into a spritzer may not be the restrained option you think, as the researchers said mixing fizzy water with wine could have a similar effect.

White wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red, according to the Food Standards Agency. Whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml, rose contains 2.5g per 100ml. Meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml

The principle could apply to all carbonated drinks, including beer, adds Dr Emma Derbyshire, a senior lecturer in nutrition at Manchester Metropolitan University and independent adviser to the Natural Hydration Council.

Although this won’t necessarily increase the severity of your hangover, getting drunk faster may impair your judgement more quickly and spur you to drink more, Dr Jarvis warns. 

It is also true that some ethnic groups suffer more after drinking because of their genetic make-up.

‘We know East Asians have very low levels of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde), which can make them get drunk more quickly and contribute to hangovers,’ says Dr Jarvis. 

And the next morning?  

When it comes to hangovers, most of us are familiar with the phrase ‘Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine, but wine before beer and you’ll feel queer.’

But why is this? 'A possibility is that beer has a higher water content than wine, so you’re getting more fluids into your body if you drink beer,’ says Dr Emma Derbyshire, a senior lecturer in nutrition at Manchester Metropolitan University and independent adviser to the Natural Hydration Council.

'People tend to drink more at the beginning of a session to quench their thirst, so beer may keep you slightly better hydrated.'

One large glass of wine can put you over the lower risk guidelines for the day. To stay on track, try these tips from Dr Sarah Jarvis, expert medical advisor to alcohol education charity Drinkaware...

1. Mind your measures 

Downsize your drinks - if you drink wine opt for a smaller glass. There are generally three sizes of wine glass – 125ml, 175ml and 250ml. 

An average 125ml glass of wine would be around 1.5 units, but a 250ml glass could be over 3 units. So, just one large glass and you’ve already drunk the equivalent of the government’s lower risk guidelines

2. Tackle your triggers 

If you always have a glass of wine to celebrate a good day at work, or commiserate a bad one, try doing something else instead. An alcohol-free dinner out makes a feel-good treat, while a gym session is a great way to relieve stress.

3. Give alcohol-free days a go 

If you drink regularly, your body starts to build up a tolerance to alcohol. This is one of the main reasons why many medical experts recommend taking regular days off from drinking to ensure you don't become addicted to alcohol . Test out having a break for yourself and see what positive results you notice.

Drink low alcohol or alcohol-free wine. The alcohol content in normal wine ranges from 9 to 15%; however, lower alcohol and no alcohol wines are readily available – have a look next time you go to the supermarket. 

4. Treat yourself 

Trade up to a special bottle of wine that's expensive enough to encourage you to saviour it over a few days, rather than down it all in one night. This way, you'll space out the units you're consuming.

5. Track your drinking over time 

If you choose to drink, recording exactly what you've drunk during the week will give you a great idea of whether you're within the guidelines. Try MyDrinkaware, a web-based drink tracking tool.
