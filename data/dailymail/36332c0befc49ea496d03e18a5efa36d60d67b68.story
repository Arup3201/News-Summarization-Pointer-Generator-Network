Not a waste of time: Scientists have suggested that playing the Angry Birds computer game can help productivity

If you thought playing games on your mobile phone while at work was a mindless distraction and waste of time, then think again.

In fact, it has been discovered that if you play popular game Angry Birds while at your desk – it could make you smarter and a better worker.

Research has suggested that playing such games can make you a more ‘resilient’ employee and help you focus at work.

A recent article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) cited research suggesting that engaging in some activities we think are non-productive - such as small exercises - may be a smart way to spend time, particularly at work.

People across the world reportedly spend 300 million minutes a day on Angry Birds, one of the most popular games available on touch-screen smartphones.

Indeed, the Prime Minister David Cameron has himself admitted to being an Angry Birds addict.

Writing in the HBR, Jane McGonigal, a game designer and author of Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, referred to research suggesting these practices can make people better problem solvers, more collaborative, and less likely to give up.

‘In other words, they can make people more resilient,’ she wrote. As a result, she has made it a personal goal to ‘waste’ at least four minutes every hour.

Ms McGonigal became made her discoveries after realising that activities such as looking at photos of baby animals or wandering around the neighbourhood - seemingly a waste of time - had helped her focus with work.

She read scientific literature about resilience - which draws on neuroscience, medicine and psychology - and discovered there are four elements that help us bounce back: physical, mental, emotional and social.
