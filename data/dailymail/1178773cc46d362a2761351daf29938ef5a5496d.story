Workers at one of Britain’s biggest family pub chains were told they had been banned from wearing poppies, it was claimed today.

Brewers Fayre employees were allegedly told the ban was down to concerns over health and safety, with waitresses and barmen at different pubs claiming nobody was allowed to wear the poppies.

But the 150-pub firm - owned by Whitbread - has insisted that it is only staff in kitchens or food preparation areas who should not wear the poppies, over fears their pin could fall in food.

However the company has taken the step of apologising to its staff - if they believed that all team members were banned from wearing poppies, saying this was ‘not our intention’.

One waitress at a Brewers Fayre in Aldershot, Hampshire, who gave her name only as Sam, 21, said she was angered by the poppy ruling and had lost a friend in the conflict in Afghanistan in 2012.

She told The Sun's Katie Hodge, Andrew Parker and Rachel Dale: ‘I’m disgusted. The worst thing you can say is “you can’t wear a poppy”, especially to someone who lost a pal or relation.’

A Brewers Fayre barman at the Highwayman in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, and the company's staff at the Home Farm in Hessle, East Yorkshire, both claimed Whitbread said ‘nobody’ could pin a poppy to their shirt at work.

But a Whitbread spokesman told MailOnline: 'It is certainly not our intention to prevent our team members from wearing poppies whilst at work. We are extremely sorry if we have led any team members to believe that is the case and if we have caused them any distress. 

'The only thing we stipulate is that in order to abide by food safety legislation, we ask team members who work in or have to pass through a food preparation area to wear poppies with a secure clasp rather than those secured by a single pin.

'We encourage all our restaurants to observe the annual two minute silence and to support the British Legion's campaign by displaying poppies for sale in their bar area.'

A Royal British Legion spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted today.

Last weekend it was reported how Welcome Break had slashed the amount of time Poppy Appeal collectors are allowed at their motorway services from two weeks to just three days.

Volunteers have sold poppies for the whole fortnight of the appeal for the last ten years - but this year they have been told they can only have three days up to Remembrance Sunday.

Welcome Break said the cutback was because they have picked Children In Need as their chosen charity this year. But Royal British Legion collectors said it would lead to a huge drop in donations.

Separate case: Welcome Break has cut the amount of time collectors can spend at their motorway services to three days. A Royal British Legion branch last year raised £6,000 at the Gordano Services (above) in Somerset

One of the local branches affected is at Portishead, Somerset, where last year volunteer collectors raised £6,000 at the nearby Gordano Services.

Brian Clayton, vice president of Portishead's Royal British Legion branch, said: ‘There was no warning. We just had volunteers turn up there and they were told they were not allowed to collect.

‘This will be a great loss to us - probably about 30 to 40 per cent. I have been a member of the branch for 17 years and for most of that time we have had a presence at Gordano for a fortnight, nine to five, seven days a week. It is very disappointing not to be given any notice.’

A Welcome Break spokesman pointed out that collection tins and boxes will still be allowed but access to poppy sellers will be restricted.

‘We continue to support the Poppy Appeal at all 27 of our locations across the UK,’ he said.

‘Whilst we have the utmost respect for the Poppy Appeal, and will display collection boxes at every available opportunity, we don't want to overload our customers with charitable requests.’
