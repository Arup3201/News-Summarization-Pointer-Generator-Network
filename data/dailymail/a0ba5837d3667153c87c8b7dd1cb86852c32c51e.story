A bridegroom died in an horrific motorcycle crash just two days after his 'fairytale' wedding.

Newlywed Phillip John Cleary, 34, died after his motorbike was hit by two cars on a country road just two days after marrying his fiancee Gemma.

Police say they believe he lost control of his motorbike and collided with one car before hitting another.

Mr Cleary, of Howden, near Hull, Yorkshire, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash on the A164, on the road between Howden and Middleton on the Wolds, on Monday evening.

Hundreds of people have joined a Facebook page paying tribute to him, called In Memory of Phill Cleary.

His sister Lisa Cleary wrote: 'My big brother. You have grown up to be such a kind-hearted, funny and generous man with such a great spirit.

'You were taken way too young and at such a special time in your life.

'You will be in my heart and in my soul forever. We will all miss you so much.'

She later posted: 'Phill, it's very apparent that you touched so many people's lives and will leave a huge hole in all our hearts.

'Everyone is saying you are a legend and I have to agree.

'You will never get old and grey, you will be remembered as the 34-year-old man, who achieved so much, met the love of his life and got to marry her in front of many smiling faces.

'I am so proud to be able to call you my brother and you will live on in our hearts forever.'

Mr Cleary was originally from east Hull and was the managing partner of The Citadel Partnership, a health and safety consultancy for the construction industry.

It is believed he worked as a doorman at pubs and clubs in Hull city centre.

His mum Sue Cleary, of east Hull, simply wrote: 'My darling son I love and miss you so much.'

Friend Richard Giles posted: 'I will never forget your trembling bottom lip when you saw Gemma walking down the aisle.

'In my drunken state, I was thinking of sneaking off to bed on Saturday without saying goodbye, if I did I wouldn't have got to say how happy I am for you and proud I was to be part of your big day.'

Ruth Colarieti, of San Luca restaurant in Hessle, said Mr and Mrs Cleary were looking forward to their wedding when they visited the restaurant last week.

She wrote: 'So shocked and saddened to hear of this devastating news.

'Phil and Gemma were in the restaurant only last week telling us how excited they both were for their wedding on Saturday. Such a lovely couple with the world at their feet.'

A HUmberside Police spokesman said: 'He was riding a blue coloured Honda motorcycle and was travelling along the A614 from Howden in the direction of Middleton on the Wolds, when the it is believed he lost control of the motorcycle.

'This resulted in a collision with a silver coloured Toyota Rav, which was travelling in the opposite direction.

'The motorcycle then collided with a blue coloured Ford Focus, also travelling in the opposite direction.

'Mr Cleary sadly died at the scene.

'The occupants travelling in the other vehicles were not injured.'
