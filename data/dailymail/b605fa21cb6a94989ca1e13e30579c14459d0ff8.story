Her story is as remarkable as it is revolutionary.

And it's ironic to think that, in a low-income housing block in Harlem - an area of New York hardly known for its safety - the most dangerous person inside is arguably an 85-year-old Chinese grandmother.

Dr Gao Yaojie - a gynecologist, author and affirmed human rights warrior - has been living in exile in Manhattan since 2009 for her tireless commitment to a crisis in China that has seen her almost universally renowned as 'the AIDS granny'.

Dr Yaojie, who cannot return to her country out of fear of being jailed for 'inciting subversion', has spent close to 20 years attempting to expose an AIDS epidemic borne out of a corrupt blood-selling scandal.

The indefatigable octogenarian went against the Chinese government to challenge official figures about the extent at which AIDS was decimating whole towns and and how it came to be the country's leading cause of death among infectious diseases.

China's first AIDS activist: Dr Gao Yaojie, who is living in exile in NewYork out of fear being imprisoned in China, has not stopped her campaign against a blood-selling scandal in her country for almost 20 years. She maintains that most of the people suffering from AIDS in China contracted it through donating blood

While officials continued to preach that HIV was contracted through sexual transmission and drug use, Dr Yaojie garnered a cache of evidence to show the infections actually came through blood donations, according to Buzzfeed.

She claims up to 10 million people, mostly in rural areas, could have been contaminated by either donating or receiving blood via transfusion as part of a ruthless money-making machine known as the 'plasma economy'.

Because of China's susceptibility to natural disaster and disease, the need for blood is paramount and extremely profitable.

Fearing the AIDS crisis in 1985, just as doctors of the world began to understand HIV was transferred via blood, China banned imports of foreign blood products under the misguided belief all their citizens were disease-free.

In 1991, the government-backed a campaign as part of this 'plasma economy', encouraging farmers to sell their blood, marketing it as both an 'honor' to the people and an easy way to make money.

The poorest of people especially jumped aboard, with hundreds of licensed blood and plasma banks popping up in provinces and thousands more illegal ones.

The process was sped up by reusing needles and pooling the blood together, meaning the stations were unknowingly transferring HIV-tainted cells to people both when taking blood from donors and when transfusing it to those in need.

It's the information of this scandal and her role in making it public that caused Dr Yaojie to feel endangered and flee China four years ago.

She says she left with nothing but blood-pressure medication in one hand and a USB stick filled with her findings in the other.

'I am in my eighties,' she told The Pulse.

'I don't care about my life.

'But I do do care about the evidence concerning the AIDS plague in China.

'My priority now is not to go back to China.

'The most important thing is to leave the evidence, the material, for posterity.

'Otherwise no one will know the truth.'

She is almost 86, but Dr Gao Yaojie is about to publish her 27th book on the cause of China's long-denied AIDS plague

Dr Yaojie's AIDS crusade began in 1996.

She was retired at the time after already living through a lifetime of turmoil during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.

A married mother-of-three, she was taken as a political prisoner for being an educated woman and spent over a year in a labor camp.

Once being reunited with her family, she was working as a doctor during the shocking one-child policy, at which point no living babies were allowed to leave hospital.

Her job was mostly centered around late-term abortions, some at full-term, before she stopping working.

But Dr Yaojie was brought out of retirement to consult on a strange case - a 42-year-old woman, Ms Ba, had undergone ovarian surgery but had not recovered after the operation.

Instead she had become more ill, with fevers, a bloated stomach and lesions.

When an AIDS test she ordered came back positive, Dr Yaojie was perplexed.

How could a simple farmer - whose husband and child had clean blood, and who was not a drug user or prostitute - have AIDS?

Dr Gao Yaojie's quest to help the people of China who had contracted AIDS started in 1996 with just one patient, Ms. Ba, whose file seemed to be the complete opposite of what the government defined as a typical AIDS sufferer

There were only a few confirmed AIDS cases in China at the time.

Dr Yaojie determined the source was a government blood bank — Ms. Ba’s post-surgical blood transfusion had infected her with HIV.

Ms. Ba died within two weeks.

'I realized the seriousness of the problem,' Dr Yaojie later wrote.

'If the blood in the blood bank carried the AIDS virus, then these victims would not be a small number.'

Over months and years, Dr Yaojie's research into the epidemic took her across much of rural China, where she discovered villages with infection rates of 20, 30, 40% or more, as well as whole communities of AIDS orphans.

There no treatment options and no education about the sickness that was killing off generations of people.

So Dr Yaojie began making public lectures and circulating pamphlets she'd had printed to increase AIDS awareness.

She was also giving out her own money to AIDS victims, hence the nickname 'the AIDS granny'.

For years Dr Gao Yaojie moved around rural China, applying medicine to people who suffered from AIDS and gathering information on what had caused such a widespread outbreak. She would even hand out her own money

Her charity exposed the local governments who weren't doing their jobs properly, as well as a government that were covering up the truth of what was happening to their people.

She began being followed and maintains that her phone was tapped for years.

In one particular AIDS village, Dr Yaojie learned the mayor had put a 500 yuan ($82) bounty on her head, with any villager who caught her entitled to the money.

But she was their savior.

'They didn’t even try to catch me - they didn’t want to turn me in,' Dr Yaojie said.

Dr Yaojie recalls one story about two boys who were best friends, one with HIV and the other healthy.

One day they were fighting, causing both to start bleeding and their blood to mix.

'They both died of AIDS,' she said, fighting back tears.

Only in 2008 did China acknowledge that AIDS is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases.

In 2011, a joint U.N.–Chinese government report estimated 780,000 people in China are living with HIV.

The report said just 6.6% of them were infected through the plasma trade.

The real numbers are subject to debate and almost certainly higher, say global health experts.

As Dr Gao Yaojie's profile increased, further incensing government officials, and following the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work, she realized she would have to leave China

It was in 2007 that Dr Yaojie realized she had to leave China, especially after the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work, one of which had been jailed for 11 years.

'I needed to leave to protect my children and my family,' she said.

She had been invited to America to receive an award from the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a group co-chaired by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.

But local officials put her under house arrest to stop Dr Yaojie from going.

According to cables released by WikiLeaks from the then-U.S. ambassador to China, Vice Premier Wu Yi — the highest-ranking woman to ever serve in China’s communist party government — intervened personally to force officials to allow Dr Yaojie to travel to the U.S. to accept the award.

She returned afterwards, but fled permanently in 2009.

Dr Yaojie has refused to discuss exactly how she managed to get out of the country, so as to protect the people who helped her.

However she managed to fly to New York from the southern city of Guangzhou shortly after the death of her husband.

Dr Yaojie spends her days writing and is about to publish her 27th book.

She says the government continues to deny the AIDS epidemic.

In May 2012, the government ordered families to demolish and clear millions of tombs set across four counties that had been used to bury the dead, in an obvious attempt to hide evidence.

'I want to stop, but I cannot,' she said.

'I am too old.

'I feel powerless to all things.

'The purpose of writing these books is to ask for justice for the victims and leave it for the later generations to judge.

'It is also a mental comfort for me.'
