Vincent George was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter following a triple fatality on a Sydney highway.

Patricia and Donald Logan were killed by truck driver Vincent Samuel George.

George was driving for company Zaens Pty Ltd, which trades as Lennons Transport.Blood samples revealed the 34-year-old had methadone in his system when he veered onto the wrong side of the Hume Highway near Menangle and crashed into the Logans' car.The trucking company and director Anthony Lennon were charged over almost 200 speeding offences committed between February 2011 and March 2012.After pleading guilty, Zaens and Lennon were ordered to pay the $1.3 million fine in the Downing Centre Local Court on Friday.

Vincent George slammed head on into a red Ford Mondeo, killing Calvyn Logan and his 81-year-old parents Donald and Patricia.

Magistrate Lisa Stapleton found apart from an induction process, Zaens did not make management responsible for speed compliance.In her judgment, she said Lennon admitted drivers did not always tell the company about their speeding offences."That is not surprising," she wrote.Roads Minister Duncan Gay said the penalty was the biggest in NSW history against a trucking company under Chain of Responsibility legislation."This is a terrible tragedy, there are no winners here, but I hope this decision by the court today brings some small comfort to the Logan family after their tragic loss," Mr Gay said.George will be sentenced in September.Â
