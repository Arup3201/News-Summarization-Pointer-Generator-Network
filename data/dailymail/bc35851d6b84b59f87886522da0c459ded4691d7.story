Fury is mounting in New York’s outer boroughs as residents left hungry, freezing and some homeless believe they are being passed over while help is directed to Manhattan.

As they scrape round desperately for food and are forced to use their gas hobs to keep warm, many claim they are the forgotten victims of Sandy and are furious that in Manhattan preparations are underway for the New York City marathon on Sunday.

‘If they take one first responder from Staten Island to cover this marathon, I will scream,’ New York City Councilman James Oddo, who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn, said on Twitter. ‘We have people with no homes and no hope right now.’

Stacked: Boats piled up on top of one another near Beach Haven Inlet on the New Jersey coastline. Residents in New York's outer boroughs, and elsewhere outside the city, believe they are being passed over while aid is directed to Manhattan

Destruction: Homes in the Sea Gate part of Brooklyn have been ripped apart by the superstorm

Ruin: Whole walls and roofs of homes in Sea Gate, Brooklyn, were destroyed by the storm

Areas of New York and New Jersey are still without power days after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast of America

The Borough President of Staten Island
called the reaction of Red Cross - or lack thereof - to the devastation
caused by Sandy an 'absolute disgrace'.

James Molinaro went as far as to tell 
people not to donate to the charity because when push came to shove, the
group just didn't deliver when Staten Island needed them the most.

'My advice to the people of Staten 
Island is do not donate to the American Red Cross,' said Mr Molinaro. 
'Let them get their money elsewhere.'

'It's an absolute disgrace in a county that has always responded to disasters all over the world,' he said.

'Katrina - we sent them down four trailer loads of food, water and one trailer load of generators. No one's responding to us.'

‘Of the 22 people across New York City that have perished, 15 of them died in Staten Island. The borough is still underwater.’

Devastating: Homes across Staten Island were flooded in the superstorm and many feel they are facing their ordeal without adequate support

The Rockaway neighbourhood of Brookly, where the historic boardwalk was washed away, has faced terrible destruction, with buildings collapsing and cars damaged

Hope: As one Sea Gate resident's possessions are left strewn across the beach in the wake of the superstorm, they send a message about life's priorities in the face of misfortune

Devastation: Walls were ripped off and buildings collapsed as Sandy ravaged buildings in Sea Gate, Brooklyn

Merciless: A beachfront house in Coney Island's Sea Gate community is reduced to rubble in the wake of the superstorm

A helping hand: Residents start to piece things together again following the superstorm's trail of destruction

Residents are pleading for help as they fear their devastated neighbourhoods are being ignored.

In a Coney Island apartment block, 
where tenants huddle together in one room and human waste spills out of 
the toilet, tenant Jeffery Francis despairs that help is not getting to 
Brooklyn faster.

‘We are scavenging for food like 
animals,’ he told the New York Daily News. 'We are in a crisis and no 
one will help us. Look at us. We are misery. Everyone cares about 
Manhattan. No one is looking out for us. Nothing.’

At another apartment where power is 
still out, residents are out of food and praying for help. Albert 
Miller, 58, told the paper: ‘One person found a sandwich and we split it
four ways.’

While power is likely to be returned 
to Manhattan’s East and West Villages, Financial District, Chelsea, 
Chinatown and the Lower East Side by the weekend, according to the power
company Con Edison outages in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island are 
not expected to be repaired for another week.

Across Staten Island residents are 
also increasingly frustrated they are being passed over while other 
parts of New York and New Jersey receive aid and attention.

Residents are furious the island is 
being prepared as the starting line for Sunday’s marathon, while 
hundreds are left hungry and without homes in the wake of the 
superstorm.

One resident there told CBS station WCBS, ‘We're gonna die! We're gonna freeze! We've got 90-year-old people!’

Natvel Pritchard, of Staten Island, 
told CBS News, ‘Though people don't talk about Staten Island much, 
people are here, a lot of people are hurting, so it's upsetting.’

Witnessing: Mayor Michael Bloomberg toured the storm damaged area of Tottenville in Staten Island with Councilman Vincent Ignizio on Wednesday... but two days later residents are feeling ignored

Disorder: A car that washed up on a bench during the superstorm in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn

Aftermath: Trees damaged several cars as Sandy made its way through Brooklyn leaving residents to pick up the pieces

Homes across Brooklyn and Coney Island are some of the worst hit in the wake of the superstorm.

Many houses shattered into piles of bricks and splintered planks at Coney Island, while others stand waterlogged and abandoned.

One gated community at the tip of the 
island, Seagate, was particularly badly hit, with some houses entirely 
washed away or flattened.

Across the bridge in Manhattan, many neighbourhoods are still in darkness and residents have resorted to
digging through filthy dumpsters for food.

The Lower East Side and East Village neighbourhoods have both been in darkness for days.

Shocking images captured groups of 
residents sifting through garbage outside a Key Food supermarket in the 
East Village yesterday.

For power companies, the scale of the 
destruction was unmatched - more widespread than any blizzard or ice 
storm and worse than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

'It's unprecedented: fallen trees, 
debris, the roads, water, snow. It's a little bit of everything,' said 
Brian Wolff, senior vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, a 
group that lobbies for utilities.

Initially, about 60 million people were without power in 8.2 million homes and businesses.

By Wednesday night, that number had fallen to roughly 44 million people in 6 million households and businesses and today around 3.8 million are without power.

Long recovery: The superstorm left great floods in its wake in Dumbo, Brooklyn and the recovery from this state on Tuesday will take some time

Chaos: Water reaches the street level of the flooded Brooklyn Battery Tunnel in the wake of Sandy

Power cut: From Brooklyn you could see Manhattan plunged into darkness during the superstorm - while one half of the city's iconic skyline is 
almost completely dark, lights are still visible on the left hand side 
of the picture
