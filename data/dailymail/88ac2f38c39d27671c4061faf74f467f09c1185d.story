Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling 'to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter'

The father of the South African model allegedly murdered by Oscar Pistorius spoke movingly yesterday of his family’s grief – and said he bore the athlete no animosity.

In an emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’.

Pistorius broke down in tears in court when he was formally charged with Reeva Steenkamp’s premeditated murder and Mr Steenkamp said: ‘He must be going through things that we don’t know about. There is no hatred in our hearts.’

Ms Steenkamp, 29, had been dating the Olympic athlete, a double-amputee known as the Blade Runner, since November.

She was shot dead in the early hours of Valentine’s Day at his gated mansion in Pretoria.

It has been reported she was hit four times by bullets fired through the door of a bathroom. Pistorius, 26, a keen marksman, owned a pistol and machine gun.

Sources told how he carried his dying girlfriend from the bathroom, her blood splattering the staircase, as he desperately tried to revive her.

The pair had been called South Africa’s ‘golden couple’, and the arrest of Pistorius – who in London last year became the first man to compete at both an Olympics and Paralympics – was met with disbelief.

Speaking for the first time since the death of his law graduate daughter, Mr Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at ‘a complete loss’.

He said: ‘This is a very difficult time for us. June is inconsolable. We just need to find some answers. We ask the Lord every day to help us find a reason why this should happen to Reeva. She was the most beautiful, kind girl in the world. She had love for everyone, and she was loved by everyone who knew her.’

Mr Steenkamp said he had never met Pistorius but his wife occasionally spoke to him on the phone.On the day of the killing, Ms Steenkamp had been due to give a talk to high school pupils ‘to empower them to be confident’.

Her father said: ‘That’s what she was like, always wanting to help others.’

Former girlfriends of the Paralympian have publicly suggested he has a dark side. 

One, 26-year-old student Samantha Taylor, said he is ‘certainly not what people think he is’. 

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Ms Taylor has been warned  to expect a subpoena, forcing her to give evidence at Pistorius’s trial.

Ms Steenkamp appeared on a TV programme, Tropika Island of Treasure, in South Africa last night, which sees celebrities paired with contestants competing for a cash prize. 

Executive producer Samantha Moon claimed the programme had the backing of Reeva’s family. She said: ‘This is how they want to remember her.’ 

Reeva’s funeral will be on Tuesday, the same day Pistorius  is due in  court where it is understood lawyers will say the shooting was a tragic accident.
