Burly trucker Glen Beardsmore might not be the sort you would expect to find crafting intricate cakes. 

But the 53-year-old former solider from Quinton, Birmingham, has not looked back since making the unusual switch from lorry driver to full-time baker.

And now Glen is making a real splash in the cookery circles, standing next to Michelin-starred chefs and winning coveted international awards.

Glen said his intricate designs - including this river scene - take him hours to create

Glen's 'river themed' creation  has won gold at the NEC's prestigious Salon Culinaire competition

His 'river themed' creation - 11 days in the making - has won gold at the NEC's prestigious Salon Culinaire competition.

The cake, a sponge salmon, was judged best in the 'sculpted novelty' category.

'Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Michelin star chefs really is something,' said Glen, who runs his Nice & Iced Cake Company business from his home. 'Then to come out with "Best in Class" - I am still reeling.'

Glen was a Royal Engineer in the Royal Monmouthshire Militia with the Territorial Army - the most senior regiment in the British Army Reserve. 

He was in the army for nine years, joining in 1989 and leaving in 1998.

The former soldier was then a HGV driver for 14 years, but was laid off by the Co-op in 2013. 

It was then that he decided to turn his kitchen prowess into a money-spinner. 

The river creation won Gold in the 'sculpted novelty' category, against cakes by Michelin starred chefs 

'I have always done the home cooking,' said Glen. 'And I made cakes for friends.

'It's hard work because there are a lot of cake makers out there. I don't miss being a lorry driver, but I am doing the same kind of hours.

'I'll get up at three or four in the morning and work through the night.

The difference is I'm at home, not stuck in Luton.'

Glen has created incredibly detailed and realistic edible versions of guitars, handbags, Walsall FC's ground and even a machine gun. But the river scene was by far Glen's most complex creation.

'Everything is edible,' he said. 'The fish is made from sponge, the tree is chocolate.' 

Glen is still in touch with his old trucker and Army friends but does admit that customers are more surprised when they find out about the baker's past life.

'When I tell them I was a soldier and HGV driver, they do a double-take,' he laughed.

It's not the first culinary award Glen has netted.

Previous awards include gold at 2013 Cake International for a military-themed creation and bronze for a comic-booked themed sugar decoration. But the Salon Culinaire honour is by far Glen's biggest.
