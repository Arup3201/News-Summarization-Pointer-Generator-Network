Protests outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh have turned violent, after news of an agreement to allow Australian refugees to be sent to Cambodia.

The plan, which will see refugees sent from the Australian detention centre on Nauru, was signed today by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Cambodia's Minister of Interior Sar Kheng.

Hundreds gathered to demand Australia renounces the agreement. One protester was knocked over by riot police and escorted from the rally bleeding from the head.

The plan will see no limits placed on how many refugees will be directed to Cambodia, however they would only be sent if they came to Australia by choice.

The details of the arrangement are otherwise shrouded in secrecy.

ABC has reported that the arrangement could begin as early as late this year.

This morning, Mr Morrison revealed the resettlement costs would be paid for by the Australian government.

'The Australian Government will be providing over four years, and $40 million to support various overseas development aid projects,' he said.

'That's on top of the $79 million - or thereabouts - we currently provide in aid to Cambodia.'

The agreement has been widely criticised, largely due to Cambodia being a poverty-stricken nation.

The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID)-the peak body for overseas aid, humanitarian and development NGOs-has branded the Australian Government's deal with Cambodia cruel and unnecessary. 

The companies executive director Marc Purcell, said 'Refugees being sent to Cambodia are being set up to fail in a poor country.

'The deal places vulnerable people in a country ill-equipped to deal with their needs and it misuses aid, while ignoring other options.

'Cambodia should not be a country of resettlement. It has a total of 68 refugees and 12 asylum seekers currently, so receiving 1,000 refugees from Nauru would increase Cambodia's current refugee caseload by 1570%,' he said.

The plan has also been condemned by Cambodia's opposition group, who said the Australian money from the deal would be corruptly spent by Cambodia's ruling party

Virak Ou, president of Cambodia's Centre for Human Rights, told ABC the deal was also illegal.

'The Australian Government has an obligation to protect refugees and sending them Cambodia's way is not how a responsible country protects refugees.

'Cambodia is in no position to take refugees. We are a poor country, the health system is sub-par at most. I don't know how the refugees will send their kids to school.

'I don't know what the Australian Government is thinking nor what they expect from this deal.'
