Is your dog glamorous enough? No? In that case, the internet has a fantastic idea for you.

Sticking false eyelashes on pets is the next online craze, if photos posted by Japanese social media users are anything to go by.

The strangely unsettling shots surfaced on the Kotaku blog, which covers the more bizarre end of life in Japan, Korea and China.

'Allo gorgeous! Someone, somewhere has decided dogs' faces aren't expressive enough - and would be improved with the use of fake eyelashes. The photos emerged on the Japanese culture blog Kotaku

Unsettling: Once seen, these photos of dogs wearing fluttering false eyelashes cannot be unseen

Recognise this? One dog bears a striking resemblance to the 'Doge' meme, based on Japanese Shiba Inus

Barking mad: This pet looks as though it is taking its owner to task for equipping it with fake eyelashes

Some pet owners have gone even further than false lashes, with one giving what appears to be a Japanese Shiba Inu a makeover with a silky neckerchief.

The surprised dog bears an uncanny resemblance to the Doge - a surreal meme of an all-knowing dog surrounded by examples of terrible grammar in the font Comic Sans MS.

It seems the craze has spread to cats, too, who look remarkably stern in their prosthetics.

But several Twitter users who tried to affix false lashes to their pets failed completely - when their accessories were mistaken for snacks.

Others were thwarted by less-than-co-operative dogs or snarling grumpy cats.

The craze is thought to have begun 
when Japanese Twitter user @30miomio3030 uploaded a picture of a lapdog 
with surprised-looking black eyelashes, which has been re-tweeted more 
than 10,000 times.

The Kotaku blog, which highlighted the craze, wrote: 'Right now, it's not a huge thing by any stretch - yet. But, for better or worse, this does exist!'

Like
 most creatures, dogs do have lashes to keep grit and pollen our of 
their eyes, but they are often shorter or harder to notice than those on
 human beings.
