Jose Mourinho insists Benfica attacking midfielder Talisca would be playing for a big club in the Premier League now if he had been able to secure a work permit.

Mourinho is a keen admirer of the Brazil Under 20 star and says he would be plying his trade in England now rather than the Primeira Liga had he got the necessary documentation. 

Speaking to Portuguese broadcaster TVI24, the Chelsea manager said: 'I think Benfica hired well. They say Talisca is unknown, but he is only so unknown because he's only not playing in England because he doesn't have a work permit. If he had one, he would be here!

'There were many English teams, great teams and important, that wanted him. Moreover, there were those who wanted to sign him, even though he could not play for now.

'They wanted to sign him, put him in a minor league [on loan] and hope that eventually he came to be selected [for Brazil's national team], and would consequently then get the work permit.'

Talisca, 20, scored a hat-trick against Vitoria Setubal on Friday and now has four for Benfica.
