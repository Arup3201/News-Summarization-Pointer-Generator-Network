Choosing shoes to match an outfit could soon be as simple - and cheap - as pressing a button on a smartphone.

A startup has designed a range of footwear that changes colour and design thanks to flexible e-ink displays built into the sides.

The range also has 'anchors' on the toe and heel so physical accessories can be added to the Volvorii Timeless smart shoes.

A startup has designed a range of footwear that changes colour and design thanks to flexible e-ink displays built into the sides. The Voltarii Timeless shoes  (example pictured) also have 'anchors' on the toe and heel so physical accessories can be added, such as bows, flowers or ankle straps

The shoes were designed by Lithuania-based iShuu Technologies, which is currently seeking funding for the footwear on Indiegogo. 

At the moment, prototypes are only available in black and white, but other colours are expected to launch if the campaign receives enough funding.

Each shoe has flexible e-ink displays on the left and right sides. 

Inside the shoe's sole is a Bluetooth receiver that connects these displays to a smartphone app.

At the moment, the prototypes are only available in black (pictured) and white, but other colours are expected to launch if the campaign receives enough funding. The team is estimating a delivery date of December this year and has raised more than $21,400 (£14,300) of its $50,000 (£33,600) target

Patterns including polka dots, animal stripes and flowers can then be selected and 'sent' to the displays on the shoes. They are made of rubber and leather in European sizes 36 to 40

The shoe also has physical customisation options. 

On the top of the toe and back of the heel are anchors, to which the wearer can attach accessories - a flower or bow on the toe, for example, and an ankle strap on the back. 

A wireless module, also in the sole, allows the shoe's display to be charged wirelessly

'The Volvorii's clean, elegant, sturdy design brings gravitas, respect and formality in an unmistakable way,' said the campaign page.

A range of smaller and larger sizes are still in development. 

Another wireless module in the sole allows the shoe's display to be charged without cables. 

However, because e-ink requires so little power, it will only need to be charged 'between two and six months' at the most.

So far, the iShuu team has created a working prototype as part of the Louis Vuitton Prize for young fashion designers, but now the team is hoping to turn the prototype into a final product.

The team is offering the Volvorii Timeless shoes $249 (£167) from Indiegogo, but he retail price after the campaign ends has not yet been announced. 

The team is estimating a delivery date of December this year.

It is hoping to raise $50,000 (£33,600) by the 12 April and has so far raised more than $21,400 (£14,300). 

 

The Fashion-Entertainments (FES) watch is raising money on crowdfunding site Makuake, and was created with help from Sony. It features 24 design patterns that can be selected at the touch of a button, has a basic design and is said to last up to 60 days on a single button battery

The Fashion-Entertainments (FES) watch is raising money on crowdfunding site Makuake and is said to have been created with help from Sony.

The Japanese tech giant confirmed its involvement with the startup to the Wall Street Journal in November and people involved in the project admitted the tech firm's name was kept a secret to see if there was demand for the gadget.

An official release date has not been announced, but customers can pre-order a FES watch (pictured, including its 24 strap designs) from Makuake, and the device is expected to ship internationally in May

This demand has been proved by the fact the campaign surpassed its fundraising goal of 2 million yen (£10,700/$17,000) in three weeks, with 140 supporters.

According to the campaign page, the watch features 24 design patterns that can be selected at the touch of a button.

It has a basic design and is said to last up to 60 days on a single button battery.

The watch weighs 50.6g, its dial is 1.5-inch (4cm) in diameter and the case is 0.2-inches (7mm) thick.

An official release date has not been announced, but customers can pre-order a FES watch from Makuake, and the device is expected to ship internationally in May.
