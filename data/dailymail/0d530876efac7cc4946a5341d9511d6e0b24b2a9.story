Beth Whaanga received an enormous amount of international support after she bore her cancer surgery scars in a nude photo shoot in February

Beth Whaanga made international headlines in February this year when she posed nude for a moving photoshoot to show off her multiple cancer scars.

Now, the brave 33-year-old has begun work on her Under The Red Dress Project alongside photographer Nadia Masot, which will see other women bare their scars in the same fashion.

Her campaign will involve an exhibition and a coffee table book that feature confronting photographs of women who have survived cancer.

Hundreds of women have so far sent letters of support to Ms Whaanga, who is from Brisbane, as well as applications to participate and be photographed for the project.

Mrs Whaanga and Ms Masot have so far hand-picked a range of women from across the world to feature in the project, which will also tell each person's personal story.

The collaborating duo are also currently in the process of sourcing funds to help kick-start their project, which aims to build awareness of cancer and the stigma surrounding the scars patients receive from treatments and surgery.

In a video the team submitted to Kickstarter, a fund sourcing website, Mrs Whaanga revealed the inspiration behind her new idea.

'What we want to achieve with the project is overall respect for other people. We also want to achieve positive body image for men and women who have been through cancer and make people more accepting about what's going on in other people’s lives,' Mrs Whaanga said.

'Those people who are fighting the fight, they need to be represented in a way that's true and honest so that people understand what they're going through is really, really hard.'

Earlier in the year, Mrs Whaanga told The Courier-Mail  that while the images were confronting, the project's message was the focus.

The Brisbane mother and her photographer, Nadia Masot, have now begun collecting pictures and stories of other women who bare cancer scars for an exhibition and coffee table book

'We're concerned about getting out the message of being vigilant and responsible for our own bodies through confronting imagery,' she said.

'It was always going to be a bit controversial and we're completely OK with people not being comfortable with that.'

Ms Masot said the project's success exceeded its expected reach.

'We just decided to do a campaign - we never anticipated the reach so suddenly,' she said.

'Even in my own photography I was thirsty to work on something more meaningful - cancer is an experience with life changing results.'

Tackling head on the ravages of her cancer surgery, Mrs Whaanga refused to hide her scarred body following a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery earlier this year, when she decided to share photos of her post-surgery body on Facebook.

After posting the photos, the Brisbane mother received a huge backlash, with more than 100 people unfriending her.

Last year on her 32nd birthday, Mrs Whaanga was diagnosed with breast cancer and doctors found she had the BRCA2 gene, which predisposes women to breast cancer.

After her surgery in November, Mrs Whaanga teamed up with friend and photographer Ms Masot, to photograph her body and illustrate the devastation of surgery as part of the Under the Red Dress project.

The duo have received over hundreds of emails from women internationally, willing to participate in their Under The Red Dress Project

The images were then posted Mrs Whaanga’s Facebook page, where she warned her friends about the confronting material.

'These images are confronting and contain topless material,' she posted.

'They are not in any way meant to be sexual. The aim of this project is to raise awareness for breast cancer. If you find these images offensive please hide them from your feed.

'Each day we walk past people. These individuals appear normal but under their clothing sometimes their bodies tell a different story.

'She added that self-examination was vital. 'It can happen to you,' she posted.

One commentator Andrew Young said Facebook was not the platform for the photographs.

'I
 personally do not agree with posting confronting pictures on a site 
where people do not get a choice whether they wish to view it, as 
happened to me when scrolling through my news feed,' he posted. This may
 also occur to children scrolling through their feed.'

Mrs Whaanga responded by saying everyone was entitled to their opinion, while Ms Masot defended the photos by reminding people that cancer did not discriminate.

Mrs Whaanga has undergone a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in November last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer

Confronting: Many of Mrs Whaanga's Facebook friends were offended by the images

Despite the images being reported to Facebook, the social network has promised that they will not be removed

'For the people who think it’s 'just not for them' may just end up being the one who will wish one day they'd payed a bit more attention when it happens to them, only worse because they chose to be offended instead of listening,' Ms Masot posted. 'Ignorance is never a better option.'

Mrs Whaanga told The Courier-Mail she was glad she posed for the photos.

'And after the surgery I feel that I will live longer, and that is the best thing for not just me but for my family,' she said,

'I really wouldn’t want to 
take away from people who are fighting that fight against breast cancer;
 I was really fortunate given my family history and gene mutation that 
my cancer wasn't as aggressive as others have suffered.'

Despite the images being reported to Facebook, Mrs Whaanga has been advised they will not be removed.

THE GENES THAT COULD LEAD TO CANCER

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. The proteins help repair damaged DNA and ensure the stability of cells' genetic material

A woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer increases if she inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2

About 12 per cent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer in their lives, while about 55 to 65 per cent of women who inherit a BRCA1 mutation and around 45 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by 70

About 1.4 per cent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer in their lives, while about 39 per cent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and about 11 to 17 per cent who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by 70

Tests that look for a known mutation in one of the genes and tests that check for all possible mutations in both genes are available

As BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are relatively rare in the general population, those with a possible family history suggests are candidates for testing.
