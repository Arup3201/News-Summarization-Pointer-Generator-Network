Children at a Christian school were asked by Ofsted inspectors if anyone there was gay, it emerged yesterday.

It was just one of the ‘inappropriate’ questions posed to pupils when watchdogs visited Durham Free School, which is set to close after being branded ‘intolerant’.

The youngsters, aged 11 to 13, were also asked whether they had met someone who was gay or bisexual and whether they had learned how to make a baby. 

Pupils at The Durham Free School reported being asked questions by a bald man who they thought was in charge, staff said

A follow-up question asked what they would do if someone who was gay or Muslim came to their school.

Details of the questions emerged a day after it was revealed how children were branded bigots because one boy gave the wrong answer when asked what a Muslim was. His answer apparently included a reference to terrorism.

Following the latest revelations, chairman of the board of governors John Denning blasted the ‘aggressive and intimidatory’ examination by watchdogs during the inspection last November

He said officials arrived ‘expecting to find evidence of religious extremism’ and that the pupils described how they had been quizzed by a ‘tall bald man’ who appeared to be in charge.

‘The trust believes that there is clear evidence that the inspectors were prejudiced by the allegations,’ he wrote. ‘Pupils were embarrassed by some questions from inspectors.’

Mr Denning said inspectors also asked how the school, which serves a prominently white British population, was raising awareness of female genital mutilation – an issue facing communities originating from Africa and the Middle East.

He added: ‘Whilst important in some contexts, [it] was not a priority for 11 and 12-year-olds in the context of the characteristics of the communities served by the school.’ 

His eight-year-old daughter Naomi, a pupil at the school, has written an open letter to the Education Secretary criticising inspectors’ ‘searching questions’.

It is the latest school to complain about being unfairly penalised by new rules forcing schools to teach British values such as tolerance – designed to combat extremism in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal in Birmingham.

Nearby Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland was put into special measures after children were branded intolerant.

Durham Free, which has 94 pupils, was opened by parents and teachers in September 2013 but will now close at Easter after Ofsted failed it on a range of factors.

Following the visit last year inspectors criticised its poor teaching, attainment and behaviour.

But they also claimed some children were ‘discriminatory’, adding: ‘Leaders are failing to prepare students for life in modern Britain. Some students hold discriminatory views of other people who have different faiths, values or beliefs from themselves.’

However, teachers say the accusation is based on conversations held with a few confused pupils.

The school’s acting headmaster Julian Eisner said parents were ‘disturbed’ about the questions and said children were left ‘distressed and upset’.

Calling for Ofsted to review its approach with ‘age-appropriate’ questions, he added: ‘[Pupils] should never be asked questions that make them feel uncomfortable or caught out by the narrow agenda of the person asking the questions.’

Staff also claim teaching has improved under a new leadership team and say inspectors were ‘prejudiced’ by allegations made by a disgruntled former employee.

The school, in County Durham, is preparing to mount a challenge against the Department for Education’s decision to withdraw its funding. Parents were told yesterday they had a week to decide on a new school for their children.

But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said Ofsted’s findings come after the Education Funding Agency identified ‘serious concerns about financial management, control and governance’, saying Durham Free had been a ‘troubled school’ for some time.

New rules: Guidelines, introduced by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) last year, require schools actively to promote 'British values' including democracy, liberty and tolerance'
