A Florida woman who tried to shoot a snake with a borrowed gun at a Pop Warner football practice was arrested Monday for discharging a weapon on school grounds.

April DeMarco, 30, was watching a football practice at Bay High School field when coaches discovered what was described as a water moccasin on the field and ordered the kids to leave.

The Panama City News Herald reports as coaches tried to whack the snake with sticks, Miren Gregory, 31, told DeMarco she had a concealed carry permit and had her handgun with her.

Shooter: April DeMarco borrowed a gun from a parent carrying at a Pop Warner football practice and fired at a snake on the field

As DeMarco took the .380-caliber pistol and lined up to take the shot, another parent warned her it was against the law to have a weapon on school property, DeMarco replied: 'I will take the blame.'

With children 20 to 50 yards away, DeMarco squeeze off one shot at the snake and missed.

DeMarco later admitted to police she was carrying a weapon on school property and shot the snake to protect the children, justifying it because she was a mother.

She was arrested Monday discharging a firearm on school property and possession of a firearm on school property.  

Gregory was arrested a day later on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a firearm on school property.

Deadly: A water moccasin's bite can be fatal for individuals with a smaller body mass, though it is often confused with other non-poisonous snakes

Concealed carry permit holders are prohibited in Florida from bringing weapons onto school grounds except during school-sanctioned events directly related to those weapons.

Police had no word on what became of the snake.
