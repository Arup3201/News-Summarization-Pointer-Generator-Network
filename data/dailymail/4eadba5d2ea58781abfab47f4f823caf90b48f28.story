Thanksgiving travel plans for millions in the Northeast are at risk from a storm which could dump snow on clogged freeways and busy airports at a rate of an inch an hour.

Forecasters said a nor'easter brewing over the Atlantic is likely to sweep up the East Coast during Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing a mixture of snow and freezing rain.

Some forecasts said as much as eight inches of snow could hit New York City in a single day, however it is likely to be between three and five inches.

Transport experts told people to change plans to leave Wednesday. The AAA recommended that the 41 million road travelers due to drive over Thanksgiving choose to either leave today or wait until Thursday in order to dodge the storm.

Start: The nor'easter, dubbed Winter Storm Cato by the Weather Channel, was set to sweep up from the south, through the Carolinas, reaching D.C. and Philadelphia with potential snow by Tuesday night

Snow day: Wednesday is forecast to bring the bulk of the snow, with areas from Washington, D.C. to Maine all at risk. Some areas had as much as ten inches of snow predicted

Intense: Wednesday night could bring more snow - even in Virginia - with the most intense fall set to hit an inch an hour

On its way: A nor’easter is expected to dump New York City with anywhere from 3 to 5 inches of snow Wednesday afternoon, turning the after-work commute and out-of-town travels into a nightmare

And the west: This NOAA satellite image taken Tuesday shows an area of low pressure over the Pacific Northwest along a stationary front. Widespread rain and mountain snow will overtake Washington, Idaho and Montana

Nast predictions: The Weather Underground forecast for Wednesday shows the East Coast's chances for rain and snow the day before Thanksgiving

Travelers wait in lines to pass through security and get to their gates at LaGuardia Airport in New York, Tuesday on November 25, 2014. A nor'easter was expected to develop along the East Coast just as millions of travelers head to their Thanksgiving destinations

Between three and five inches is expected to drop on New York on Wednesday afternoon, however most of it is likely to have melted by Thanksgiving, according to The New York Daily News.

The storm will hit the eastern corridor from Boston to Washington.  

Meanwhile airlines - which canceled flights yesterday and are due more high winds and bad weather - were offering passengers the chance to switch their flights away from Wednesday for free.

American Airlines told fliers they can switch some Northeastern routes from Wednesday to Tuesday or Thursday for free.

Delta was offering switches from Wednesday flights to ones on Thursday and Friday.

The storm will bring a mixture of snow and rain across the East Coast - and especially the I-95 corridor, though it is uncertainly exactly where the divide between the two will fall.

(Predictions from The Weather Channel, valid 9.30am ET)

Snow map: The interior of New England is due the mos snow - but much of the I-95 corridor is within the 5 to 8 inches category above. The National Weather Service said 5 inches could hit New York City in the daytime, with another 3 inches at night

Second opinion: The above map shows how likely an area is to receive at least two inches of snowfall - with dark red areas practically certain to be hit. New York City sits around the 60-70 per cent band

According to the Weather Channel, the dividing line itself will see the most intense precipitation, with as much as an inch an hour falling. One line of thinking pegs the dividing line almost exactly over the I-95.

'I would pack your patience,' said Robert Sinclair of AAA New York. 'Unfortunately, the storm is scheduled to hit right in the middle of getaway day.'

Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said that the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine.

Officials at the three major airports in the New York City area — Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were 'monitoring weather forecasts carefully,' and were ready to take action if needed, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports.

All the major U.S. airlines were closely monitoring the situation but have not yet canceled flights or made any other changes. 

Nationwide: Much of the nation is due to be clear Tuesday, as the beginnings of the winter storm can be seen hitting the East Coast

Storm proper: Wednesday brings the largest bands of snow in the north, while rain continues in the south. The west of the country is due a clear day

Holiday: On Thanksgiving itself snow is not due over much of the country - though Washington, D.C. could be hit by flurries
