Killer: Adam Lanza may have had a much broader plan when he forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday

The crazed gunman in the Connecticut shooting was carrying an arsenal of ammunition big enough to kill just about every student in the school if given enough time, according to police.

Adam Lanza shot himself in the head just as he heard police drawing near to the classroom where he was slaughtering helpless children.

He blasted his way into the building 
and used a high-powered rifle to kill 20 children and six adults, 
including the principal who tried to stop him.

But now it has been revealed he had more ammunition in the form of multiple, high-capacity clips each capable of holding 30 bullets, raising the possibility Lanza had planned an even deadlier massacre and was stopped short.

'There was a lot of ammo, a lot of clips,' said state police Lt. Paul Vance.

'Certainly a lot of lives were potentially saved.'

The chief medical examiner has said 
the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim's body 
and inflict the maximum amount of damage, tearing apart bone and tissue.

Mr Vance said that Lanza had 'hundreds' of bullets remaining when he killed himself in the school, and was in possession of multiple high-capacity magazines for all of the four guns he brought with him.

Lanza had a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle and two handguns on his person when his dead body was found by police, and he also had a shotgun in the car parked outside of the building.

'The Bushmaster was used in the school in its entirety and the handgun was used to take his own life,' Mr Vance said in a Sunday afternoon press conference.

Speaking on ABC's 'This Week,' Gov. Dannel Malloy said Lanza shot himself as police entered the building.

'We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that, decided to take his own life,' Malloy said.

Malloy offered no possible motive for
the shooting and a law enforcement official has said police have found 
no letters or diaries left behind that could shed light on it.

All
the victims at the school were shot with a rifle, at least some of them
up close, and all were apparently shot more than once, Chief Medical 
Examiner Dr H. Wayne Carver said.

There were as many as 11 shots on the bodies he examined.

All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls.

Asked whether the children suffered, Carver said, 'If so, not for very long.' Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, 'I'm lucky if I can tell you how many I found.'

Parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock, Carver said.

The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages - the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56.

Witnesses say Lanza was going from room to room shooting people, after first killing the principal Dawn Hochsprung and the school psychologist Mary Sherlach execution-style when they confronted him in the hallway

They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him.

The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change.

Residents and faith leaders were sure to reflect Sunday on the mass shooting and what meaning, if any, to find in it. Obama planned to attend an interfaith vigil â€“ the fourth time he will have traveled to a city after a mass shooting.

On Saturday, overflow crowds packed St Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church. The Rev. Richard Scinto, a deacon, gave a homily.

'In the past 48 hours I've said the phrase "I don't know" about 1,000 times,' he said. 'That not knowing has got to be the worst part of this whole thing.'
