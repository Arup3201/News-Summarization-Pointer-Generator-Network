A delivery man died today after a tape measure fell 50 stories and hit him in the head after slipping off a workman's belt.

Gary Anderson, 58, was bringing drywall to a construction site in Jersey City this morning when the one-pound tape measure plummeted, bounced off construction equipment and struck him.

Ambulances rushed to the scene after the accident, which took place around 9am, but an hour later he had died in hospital.

Site: The tape measure fell 50 floors from this apartment building, killing Gary Anderson, 58

Anderson, from Somderdale, New Jersey, an hour and a half south of Jersey City, had a hard hat in his car, but wasn't wearing it, police said.

A spokesman for Jersey City's department of public safety said the tape measure fell from the fiftieth floor of an under-construction apartment block on Christopher Columbus drive.

As it fell, it ricocheted off construction equipment around 10ft above the ground, and hit Anderson in the head.

Seconds before, he had been speaking to another worker, who was inside a pickup truck.

A police report listed Anderson as working for Charlotte, North Carolina-based National Gypsum, a company based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

A spokesman for the company said he was delivering their product at the time of the accident but was employed by an independent trucking company.

Two 50-story residential towers and an attached hotel are being built at the site of the accident.
