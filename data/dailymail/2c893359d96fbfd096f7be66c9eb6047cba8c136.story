Shoppers will boycott milk from farms in areas where badgers are being shot to stop the spread of TB among cattle, the RSPCA has predicted.

The charity said that while it is not calling for a boycott, consumers will vote with their feet.

Those opposed to planned cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset may also choose not to holiday there.

Badger boycott: The RSPCA is predicting that shoppers will boycott milk from farms in areas where badgers are shot to stop the spread of TB among cattle

Gavin Grant, the RSPCA’s chief executive, said: ‘Those who care will not want to visit areas or buy milk from farms soaked in badgers’ blood.’ 

Mr Grant said that supermarkets should label milk produced from areas outside the cull zone as being ‘badger friendly’, in the same way as some cans of tuna are marked out as being ‘dolphin friendly’.

RSPCA spokesman David Bowles said: ‘What we would like to see is people being given a choice when they go into their supermarket, whether to buy milk from a badger cull area or not.

‘It’s a very simple consumer choice issue, it’s not about a boycott.’ 

However, the National Farmers Union has warned that labelling would not be simple and says that if the spread of bovine TB is not stemmed, customers will ultimately end up paying more for their milk.

NFU president Peter Kendall told 
BBC2’s Newsnight that to try and bankrupt farmers and put them out of 
business is ‘a really dangerous message’.

Bovine
 TB, which can be spread by badgers, leads to up to 30,000 cattle being 
slaughtered a year, at a cost to the dairy industry of around 
£90million.

The row over the best way to control it has been inflamed by the Government giving the go head for trained marksmen to shoot up to 70 per cent of the badgers on 300 farms in West Gloucestershire over the next four years.

Approval for a similar scheme in Somerset is expected later this week.

Fosters disease: Critics say that some studies have shown that culling badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease

The NFU says that with the number of cases of bovine TV ‘exploding’ in recent years, a cull is the only option.

Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh says there is widespread concern about the decision to continue the cull

But critics favour other methods, 
including vaccination. They accuse the government of making a decision 
based on politics rather than science and say that studies have shown 
that culling badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease, 
rather than slow it.

This may be because disturbing a badger population causes survivors to roam further afield, taking the disease with them.

A petition to halt the cull has gathered more than 100,000 signatures, meaning the issue could be debated in parliament.

More extreme animal welfare groups are planning other methods of protest including sabotaging culls and vandalising supermarket cash machines.

Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘There is widespread concern about the Government’s decision to press ahead with a badger cull despite their own official advice that it will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by the shooting.

‘Ministers should listen to the scientists and can this cull which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.’
