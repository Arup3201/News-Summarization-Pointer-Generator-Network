Last week scientists at Birmingham University claimed to have come up with the perfect formula for stacking a dishwasher.

But rather than causing cheers all round, it has intensified the bitter arguments that rage every day among the millions of dishwasher-owning households nationwide. So who are the best dishwasher stackers? Husbands — or wives?

Alice and Justin Smellie (pictured) like many couples, have long battled over the best way to stack a dishwasher

Alice and Justin Smellie, who have been locked in a dishwasher war for most of their 12-year marriage, invited Emily Wimborne, dishwasher expert at retailer John Lewis, into their home to settle the argument once and for all.

Alice says:

Early evening, and peace has descended. The children have been fed and watered and the house is (reasonably) clean. I’m about to settle into the sofa with a well-deserved glass of wine when I hear bad-tempered clattering in the kitchen.

I peer around the door and see Justin, crouching in a cloud of steam, hastily rearranging the contents of the dishwasher mid-cycle.

He just cannot help himself. Convinced of his dishwasher-stacking superiority, he cannot bear to leave this most vital domestic task in my — in his opinion — incapable hands.

Justin clearly is not alone. Those Birmingham University scientists actually published a research paper on dishwasher stacking.

They solemnly tracked water movement inside the machine, deciding what should be put where — in relation to the position of water jets and dirtiness of the crockery — to come up with the perfect formula.

I’m afraid I read this report and snorted; just as I do when Justin nitpicks over the placing of plates and bowls when he could be enjoying a glass of wine on the sofa with me.

It’s a machine for washing up. Just chuck your dishes in, I say. Every day after breakfast I throw cereal bowls, spoons, milk pan and toast plates willy-nilly into our ten-year-old Bosch and leave it to do its stuff.

Alice takes the view that it's a machine for washing up and therefore everything that goes in will somehow end up getting clean 

In my opinion, all the dishes will get clean somehow.

The worst case scenario is that I end up hand-washing a few less-than-perfect items afterwards. Really, what’s the problem?

But when I return from the school run, invariably I find that a scientifically-minded pixie has popped in for a visit. That’s a male pixie in his mid-40s, wearing a cardigan and harrumphing as he rearranges the dishwasher to his own satisfaction.

Crockery is rinsed, glasses arranged in height size and all the cutlery is facing upwards. This same pixie has also taken out anything heavily soiled ‘to hand wash’. I’m afraid Justin thinks I am a slattern and I think he is an insane perfectionist. Some of the bitterest words of our marriage have been spoken over a box of Finish dishwasher tablets.

But now scientists are on the case, I realise there may be more to dishwasher stacking than I thought.

Although they vary widely in price and size, dishwashers all work on the same principle: water in the bottom of the appliance heats up, then two rotating spray arms — one under the lower rack and one under the upper one — spray the water at the dishes.

Currently, around 30 per cent of us own a dishwasher — which horrifies me. How do the rest cope? I always thought it was as vital to a kitchen as pots and pans.

Alice values speed over efficiency when dealing with the dishes, whereas Justin takes a more methodical approach

And dishwasher wars are rife: 42 per cent of people surveyed last September admitted they had reloaded the dishwasher after their family had gone to bed because they thought it was done incorrectly.

And there is the entirely reasonable sounding statistic that 79 per cent had put a load through again just to save the bother of unloading the dishwasher. Guilty as charged, M’Lud.

Justin, in a tragic attempt to impose order on a chaotic world (or rather, his chaotic wife) once talked me through his method. It did not end well. I still could not see why his method was better than any other.

For our test together, I coated a number of plates with egg, lasagne, Weetabix and baked beans, swilled milk and red wine around glasses, and filled cups with coffee then tipped it away.

I gave Justin and myself an identical number of dishes to stack, then we put them through the same 45-minute cycle.

Emily actually looks sad as she watches me throwing everything in. As far as I’m concerned it’s all about speed — and nothing else.

I stuff the cutlery into the basket, not caring whether it’s handle-end or blade-end facing down. Plates are put in any spare slot, and I don’t care whether serving dishes go on the bottom rack or the top. Glasses and mugs are also placed wherever I can see a space.

Poor thing. Emily has devoted her life to appliances and here I am, abusing one.

I actually see her wince at one point of the process and begin to wonder if I should be giving the whole thing more thought.

Yet the job is done in minutes. The door is slammed shut and the reassuring sound of churning water fills the kitchen. I still cannot imagine how the end result would differ from anyone else’s.

Emily's verdict: The only good thing I can say about Alice’s stacking is that it’s fast. Otherwise, it’s a disaster.

She has put the lasagne pan on top, taking up masses of space. It’s further from the powerful jets of water at the bottom and so is unlikely to get clean.

Emily (pictured) said: 'the only good thing I can say about Alice’s stacking is that it’s fast. Otherwise, it’s a disaster'

All the cutlery is facing downwards, where the water can’t get to the business end as easily and she’s barely scraped the dishes. The glasses at the bottom are more likely to get damaged because they’re more likely to get knocked over by the powerful bottom jets.

Most of it is filthy when the wash is finished and I am particularly disgusted by the glass of water which she shoved in upside down and which ended up full of cloudy water and old baked beans. A total dishwashing fail.

Time taken: Two minutes

Stacking: 4/10

Cleanliness: 3/10

Justin says:

When I read the University of Birmingham paper, it resonated with good sense.

Lead researcher Dr Raul Perez-Mohedano, suggested packing the dishes according to the type of stain they demonstrate. So potato and tomato need as much force as possible from the water jets. Proteins such as egg yolk need more chemical detergent. In our household, where I am the only person with the ability to stack a dishwasher, this, sadly, will never happen.

One of my daily chores, as necessary as the dog walking and school run, is re-stacking the dishwasher. At least twice.

If Alice turns it on before I catch her, I often have to pull it open at the end of a cycle, look despairingly inside and put it on again because not one of the plates or cups is clean.

My approach is — I believe — obvious, straightforward and logical. I rinse dirty food from plates before putting them in. Cutlery faces upwards and the more tidily it is lined up, why, the more likely it is to get clean. Anything which is too dirty is washed by hand.

Justin, pictured with Emily, has a logical approach which involves rinsing the worst affected dishes and stacking cutlery upright

I wonder whether the oft-quoted idea that men have superior spatial awareness skills, and a natural leaning towards creating ‘systems’, such as filing and rotas, may be why I am so much better than this than Alice.

There’s also an argument that testosterone helps us achieve dominance in whatever goal we set ourselves. Perhaps my determination to stack the dishwasher correctly makes it a success. (Though I can’t help thinking it’s a bit of a waste of my testosterone).

There is clearly never going to be any resolution of the argument in our house, as each of us is convinced they are right. Realistically, neither of us is prepared to concede any ground.

So, I was happy to hand the argument over to an expert, in a bid to prove that my way is right.

Emily’s verdict: Every single item emerged sparkling and clean.

Justin’s method is beautifully orderly. All the mug handles are pointing in the same direction, so you can just pull them out together and put them away quickly.

Justin (pictured) scored a massive 9.5/10 for his stacking abilities and 9/10 for cleanliness, losing marks only for putting the detergent in the cutlery basket 

The same size plates are carefully stacked together and pans and heavy objects are on the bottom — nearer to both the detergent and the jets of water.

Everything is placed at a careful angle so all the water runs off.

I removed half a point from Justin’s score, but only because he put the detergent in the cutlery basket. For optimal cleaning the detergent should only be released when the water is at the right temperature. But otherwise this is brilliant. Almost professional.

Time taken: Six minutes

Marks for stacking: 9.5/10

Marks for cleanliness: 9/10

Justin’s reaction: I suspect that the smug look on my face is unbearable. I am grinning and holding up two shiny clean plates I’ve pulled from our dishwasher. I am clearly the overall winner of the decade long Dishwasher Wars in the Smellie household.

Alice’s reaction: OK, so some of the plates came out a little grubby. So what? Now Justin’s superiority has been confirmed, I am happy to hand over the task in its entirety to him.

I hope he and the dishwasher are very happy together.
