The man who was caught on camera fleeing a New York City subway station with a grin on his face after attacking an MTA worker has surrendered, and he's a New York Police Department officer, authorities say.

On December 23, around 2.30am, on a New York southbound D Train platform at the Tremont Avenue station near Grand Concourse, a 28-year-old Metropolitan Transportation Authority worker was grabbed by the then-unknown assailant, according to PIX11.  

The man grabbed her, threw her to the ground and began choking her before fleeing the scene, the New York Daily News reports.

Recognized Himself: Police say the officer recognized himself in the video and turned himself in at the 25th Precinct in Harlem

The woman was taken to a hospital where she was treated for minor injuries to her neck and back, CBS reports.  

The NYPD released a surveillance video of the attacker running through a subway turnstile and smiling. Once the video circulated, police realized they were looking for one of their own. 

The Daily News reports that people called investigators, identifying the assailant as a Harlem cop. 

The off-duty officer surrendered and was questioned Thursday, claiming he attacked the woman after she tried to grab his cell phone, according to CBS. 

The officer reportedly told investigators that the woman cursed at him when he asked her a question. Then the woman grabbed his phone to keep the officer from taking a picture, CBS reports. 

Police say the officer recognized himself in the video, that has received nearly 100 views on YouTube, and turned himself in at the 25th Precinct in Harlem.

No charges were immediately filed, according to the Daily News, but the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident.
