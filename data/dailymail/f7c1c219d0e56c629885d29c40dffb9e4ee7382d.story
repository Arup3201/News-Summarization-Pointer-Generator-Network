Ed Miliband was accused of ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ last night after urging the Government not to ‘wash its hands’ of Syria.

The
 Labour leader, who effectively blocked Britain from joining plans for 
allied strikes on Syria this week, said the Prime Minister must now find
 ‘other ways’ to end the slaughter in the war-torn country.

Mr
 Miliband’s U-turn on Syria infuriated Mr Cameron this week and led to a
 shattering Commons defeat on Thursday night over his plan for 
intervention.

Former Labour Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said that public opinion could quickly change from anti-intervention as reports of gruesome attacks in Syria increase

The PM also accused the Opposition leader of siding with Russia while betraying America in terse phone exchanges.

When
 he finally revealed he would not support missiles going into Syria 
without more conditions, Mr Cameron accused him of ‘letting down 
America’ and ‘siding with [Russia’s foreign minister Sergei] Lavrov’, 
who is an ally of Syria.

But 
yesterday Mr Miliband insisted he was not turning his back on the 
victims of the civil war, including the hundreds of children attacked 
with nerve gas by the regime of tyrant Bashar al-Assad.

‘We need the peace talks to get going,’ he said.

‘So there are other things the Government should be doing.’

A
 Government source last night accused Mr Miliband of ‘breathtaking 
hypocrisy’, adding: ‘It’s beyond parody. He needs to start taking some 
responsibility for his own actions.’ 

Business
 minister Matthew Hancock took to Twitter, saying: ‘Didn’t think Ed 
Miliband could sink much lower but having given in to his party to 
scupper action, now he asks Government not to “wash its hands”.’

The
 row came amid mounting speculation that Mr Miliband, who initially 
indicated cautious support for intervention, pulled back after being 
warned that as many as seven members of his frontbench team could resign
 if he backed retaliatory strikes against the Assad regime.

Health spokesman Diane Abbott indicated she would consider quitting if Mr Miliband backed the Prime Minister.

Transport
 spokesman Jim Fitzpatrick resigned anyway, saying he was opposed to any
 prospect of intervention.

A senior Labour source said it was 
‘categorically untrue’ that any members of the Shadow Cabinet had 
threatened to resign.

Labour's Transport spokesman Jim Fitzpatirck resigned before the vote. Seven frontbench Labour ministers were said to be preparing to resign if action went ahead

Meanwhile,
 Labour’s Blairites descended into soul-searching about the fact that 
the party now appeared to have adopted a clear anti-interventionist 
stance.

Former Labour Culture 
Secretary Ben Bradshaw blamed Mr Cameron for the outcome, but insisted 
that Labour must not turn its back on the unfolding crisis in Syria.

Mr Bradshaw said MPs had voted against military action ‘by accident’.

He
 added: ‘Public opinion is fickle. More reports like last night’s on the
 BBC of an appalling attack on a Syrian primary school could quickly 
change the public mood.’ 

Peter
 Watt, Labour’s former general-secretary said he was ‘slightly ashamed’ 
of the outcome of Mr Miliband’s manoeuvrings, adding: ‘I just hope that 
if the evidence is compelling (not conclusive) that the Americans take 
action.’

Yesterday Mr Miliband
 said he had not ruled out ever backing military action in Syria, but 
added: ‘Given where we are and given what’s happened, I think now 
Britain needs to focus on what Britain can do for the people of Syria. 

‘The innocent of Syria have been let down by domestic politics and domestic political calculation.’

Mr Miliband said it was right that Britain and the US made their own decisions about how to respond to the situation in Syria.

‘America
 has got to take its own judgment about what’s right for America, but 
Britain also has to take its own judgment about where its national 
interests lie and how we should be acting,’ he said.

But Mr Miliband insisted the UK-US relationship ‘remains strong’.
