A police force is to equip every officer and community support officer with a body-worn video camera.

Staffordshire Police say supplying front-line staff with the cameras will help cut crime and speed up prosecutions.

But civil liberties campaigners warned the public could be filmed unwittingly if they are not aware the camera is on.

Staffordshire Police will become the first force in Europe to have every officer equipped with such devices

The force is spending £330,000 on 500 lapel-worn cameras for officers, PCSOs and volunteer specials.

It will become the first in Europe to have every officer equipped with the devices.

Police say video footage is much more effective in securing convictions than police verbal accounts, which can be challenged in court.

They say the cameras are a huge money-saver because they save court preparation time and often force an early guilty plea.

But critics have described them as an unnecessary extension of State surveillance.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch said: ‘As a bare minimum, no member of the public should be subjected to this kind of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place, why and how they can access a copy for themselves.

‘This is hardly a measure that will reassure communities that the police are working for them, not treating everyone as suspects to be recorded.

‘Is it worth such a serious shift in the relationship between the police and the public to save a few hours of paperwork, rather than to ask why the paperwork is there in the first place?’

The cameras record high-definition video and can record sound from up to 20 feet away.

Staffordshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Ellis said: ‘These cameras are exceptional value for money.

‘They will free up officer time and create thousands of extra hours of visible policing.

‘It will help officers get the best possible evidence. It will protect people who are being arrested and it will save a vast amount of time by providing actual pictorial evidence in court rather than thousands and thousands of words.

‘One of my officers went to break up a fight at a pub in Newcastle the other day - and as soon as he pressed the record button, the fighting stopped.'

The move was backed by frontline officers’ representatives.

Andy Adams, chairman of the Staffordshire Police Federation, said: ‘I imagine that as a matter of course officers will turn on their camera during violent or domestic incidents, but they will have some discretion over when they choose to record arrests.’

In May, Home Secretary Theresa May said all officers walking the beat should wear body-mounted cameras.

As well as helping convict criminals, they help make sure ‘vexatious’ complaints against officers are promptly dismissed, she said.

Improvements in technology make them much more affordable than in the past.

Mrs May said five forces were already using them routinely in England and Wales. They are also in use in Scotland.

She told the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth: ‘Body-worn cameras can help improve the collection of evidence.’
