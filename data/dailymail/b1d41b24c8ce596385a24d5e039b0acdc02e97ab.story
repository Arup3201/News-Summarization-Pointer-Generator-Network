Ministers came under fresh criticism for their handling of the NHS last night after it emerged  the ambulance service will be hit with £90 million in fines – as punishment for the chaos blighting casualty departments. 

Critics said the fines will simply deprive trusts of vital funds that could help tackle the deterioration in patient services.

A new penalty clause that was written into ambulance trust contracts from last month will levy fines of £200 for every patient who has to wait for longer than 30 minutes for admission to A&E, and £1,000 for each patient forced to wait more than an hour.

Closures: The devastating impact of casualties shutting across the nation

Delays: The ambulance service faces millions of pounds in fines if patients cannot be delivered to A&E units

But acute overcrowding in A&E 
departments has led to increasing ambulance ‘jams’ formed as they queue 
to unload, with waits of four hours recorded at some hospitals at the 
busiest times.

Damning new 
figures reveal that during the past year there were more than 265,000 
occasions in England when ambulance staff took more than half an hour to
 deliver patients into the hands of hospital doctors.

Doctors and MPs have vowed to fight ‘disastrous’ new plans to close two more A&E departments that will affect more than a million people.

The proposals come despite growing concerns about  over-burdened emergency departments across the country, with record attendance figures and soaring waiting times.

NHS bosses have tabled plans to close A&Es at hospitals in Epsom, Surrey, and St Helier in nearby Carshalton – even though they are highly regarded by patients.

It means eight A&Es within the M25 are now threatened with closure, joining a growing list nationwide. 

Proposals to downgrade Epsom and St Helier A&Es to ‘urgent care centres’ were slipped out on the website of an NHS review panel for South-West London called Better Services, Better Value. Some of these UCCs are staffed only by nurses. Consultant-led maternity services at St Helier could also go.

The review panel says that concentrating services at three hospitals in the region is necessary because the existing five are failing to meet quality standards.

Centralising will mean senior staff are available round the clock, it says. The plan is to beef up  GP surgeries and other ‘community services’ to stop people going to A&E.

But Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam, said: ‘Proposing the closure of A&E and maternity at St Helier without a clear idea of how the GP and community services will be improved is a recipe for disaster. 

‘It will shunt more people  into what are already busy and often overloaded A&E and maternity units.’

He is being supported by other MPs, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Tory MP for Epsom and Ewell, who says the plans would mean ‘cannibalising’ two hospitals to ‘bolster’ the remaining three, in Kingston, Croydon and Tooting.

In England and Wales, at least  14 hospitals have either closed their casualty wards or have cut their services. 

A further 14 A&E departments are under threat of being closed down or merged.

And shockingly, more than 37,000 patients had to wait over an hour to move on to the wards. 

Official guidelines say ambulances should deliver patients, clean the ambulance and be back out on the road within 15 minutes. A longer wait is seen as ‘unsafe’.  

Yet the chaos in A&E departments is so bad that at one, the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, doctors were forced to put up a  tent to act as a makeshift ward to treat patients alongside the ambulance queue.

If the ‘handover delays’ continue at their current level then the ambulance trusts will have to find nearly £90 million to pay to the Department of Health over the next financial year.

The fines were introduced after NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson said last year that he would like to see handover delays treated as ‘never events’ because of their impact on patients.

Fewer than a third of trusts hit their target of achieving a 15-minute turnaround in 95 per cent of cases. In London, where the situation is at its worst, the 15-minute target is missed in nearly half of all cases.

Last night Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said that depriving one part of the Health Service of money as a ‘punishment’ for delays beyond its control was divisive and counterproductive.

‘This is a clear sign of the chaos 
that is now engulfing the NHS,’ he said. ‘People expect to see the NHS 
pulling together to protect patients. They do not expect to see one part
 of it fighting another.

‘A&E
 departments across the country are reaching crisis point. Thousands of 
nursing posts have been lost, leaving hospitals understaffed. David 
Cameron has slashed council budgets to the bone, resulting in cuts to 
home care and support, leaving elderly patients stranded unnecessarily 
in hospital beds.

‘Hospitals can’t move patients from A&E through to wards so ambulances are unable to discharge patients.

‘Now, to top it all, hospitals are having to pay thousands of pounds in fines because of the delays. 

‘This
 is no solution and it will only make matters worse. These are problems 
made in Downing Street, not in our hospitals. It is David Cameron’s 
toxic medicine of budget cuts and top-down reorganisation that has 
brought the system to its knees.

‘He
 urgently needs to get a grip and sort out this crisis. This money 
should be used to put nurses in our hospitals not paid out in fines.’

Queues: Problems in A&E are causing  some patients waiting over an hour to be moved into hospital

The region with the greatest number of handover delays was London, which had 63,962 delays longer than 30 minutes.

Of these, 4,240 were over an hour. If that is repeated this year, the trust will have to pay more than £17 million in fines.

West Midlands Ambulance Service faces 
the highest fine – more than £20 million – if it repeats its 63,426 
delays. Its fine would be the highest because an alarming 8,010 of these
 were longer than an hour. 

Critical: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said fining ambulance services was divisive and counterproductive

The best performance came from the South West Ambulance Service (North), where just 10,596 delays of more than 30 minutes were recorded last year.

Even this performance would see the trust hit by a fine of £6.4 million.

Delays at A&E mean ambulance crews may be prevented from attending other emergencies, if paramedics are stuck in corridors or in their vehicles with patients waiting for a nurse or doctor to take over.

Although procedures are in place to ensure that those whose lives are in danger can be fast-tracked into hospital ahead of those not at immediate risk, critics say patient care is still seriously jeopardised.

Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb, who as North Norfolk MP has observed the problems of the Norfolk and Norwich first-hand, said: ‘The situation with ambulance handovers has been unacceptable, and can mean that they miss their response times to other incidents.

'We have got to try to understand why the demand for A&E services is going up so much.’

Last night, a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We believe that everyone should be seen quickly when they arrive at hospital, even more so when they arrive in  an ambulance. It is unacceptable for patients to be left waiting in ambulances outside hospitals.

‘The NHS needs to ensure it has proper plans in place to deal with high demand and we are doing everything we can to support the service in treating patients as swiftly as it can.’

Tens
 of thousands of readers have backed The Mail on Sunday’s campaign 
against A&E closures since it was launched last September. 

We have received a total of 32,074 protests from our readers – 17,290 coupons, 9,745 emails and 5,039 text messages. 

They
 are concerned that closing down their local A&E departments could 
risk lives as  it will lead to longer journey times to hospital.

In
 October, we delivered your response to David Cameron’s doorstep, when 
our reporters handed over two bulging mailbags of your petitions to 10 
Downing Street. In the same month, a powerful lobby of 140 senior 
physicians, academics and surgeons signed an open letter to Mr Cameron 
calling for an end to the ‘indiscriminate’ closure of A&E units 
across the country. 

They accused health chiefs of driving through changes just to save money, rather than for valid clinical reasons.

It
 is believed that more than 25 A&E wards out of 220 units have 
closed down, been downgraded or face being shut. Such cuts are having 
devastating impacts on local residents.
