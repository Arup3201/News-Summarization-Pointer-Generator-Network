A British company director took pictures of children holidaying at a French naturist resort, using a mini spy camera hidden in a car key fob.

Adrian Harvey, 43, sneaked up on the children and teenagers after driving alone to the beachside complex, dubbed Naked City, a French court heard yesterday.

The married father-of-four had bought the gadget days before he arrived at the Village Naturiste, a self-contained resort which attracts up to 40,000 visitors each day, at Cap d’Agde on the Mediterranean coast.

He was spotted pointing the key fob at groups of youngsters on the resort’s beach, where nudism is obligatory.

Gendarmes were summoned and discovered the fob housed a hidden camera which contained images of naked or nearly nude children, aged from six to 18.

Harvey told the court, in the medieval town of Beziers, that he travelled to the resort after taking a few days off from the IT business he runs with wife Kate from their bungalow in Inkberrow, Worcestershire, because the pair were going through marital difficulties.

He checked into a hotel near Cap d’Agde and said he had chosen the nudist beach because of its beauty.

Asked why he had not visited beaches in Britain, Harvey replied that they were too cold.

The presiding judge suggested Harvey may have been attracted to Naked City because of its reputation for voyeurism and exhibitionism.

Cameras and the taking of recorded images are banned, but the court heard there have been numerous cases of paedophiles caught filming youngsters naked at the site.

During the past ten years there have been clashes between people describing themselves as pure naturists and voyeurs and exhibitionists who engage in sex acts on the beach. Nightclubs at Cap d’Agde regularly feature group sex parties.

Harvey claimed he only took the images out of ‘curiosity’ and told the court he planned to delete them, adding that he was ashamed of his behaviour.

Harvey, who has no previous convictions, admitted possessing pornographic images of minors and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, suspended for five years.

He told the panel of three female judges: ‘I fully understand the gravity of the situation. I am deeply ashamed. It will not happen again.’

Asked why he took the mini camera to Cap d’Agde he said, through an interpreter, that he ‘liked model aeroplanes and he intended to use it to film them’.

‘I thought it would be less intrusive than a normal camera’, Harvey added.

When the judge suggested he had brought the camera with him to film naked children, Harvey did not reply but hung his head in the dock.

Mrs Harvey, listed as company secretary of her husband’s firm – Common Nonsense – last night claimed not to know about her husband’s court appearance.
