Hackers have launched an attack on eBay which meant that bidders were redirected to a malicious site designed to capture their names and passwords.

The scam was spotted by an eBay user based in Scotland, who accused the company of taking too long to remove and shut down the rogue account.

He said the auction site was alerted to the problem on Wednesday night but did not remove the suspect listings until more than 12 hours later.

Paul Kerr, an IT worker from Alloa in Clackmannanshire, said that other less tech-aware users might not have realised the danger they were in. 

‘You can bet your bottom dollar that somebody’s going to click on that and be redirected to a third-party site and they’re going to enter their details and be compromised,’ he told the BBC. 

‘You don’t know how many of the people who use eBay will have done that.’

An eBay spokesman said: ‘We take the safety of our marketplace very seriously and are removing the listing as it is in violation of our policy on third-party links.’

In May, eBay revealed that a database containing encrypted passwords and other non-financial data had been compromised.
