Chris Evans has flown in by helicopter to view the world famous Dunlop Bridge he paid just £250 for - boasting he had got 'one of the greatest bargains of all time'.

BBC Radio 2 DJ Evans - who has an £87million fortune - snapped up the bridge which has been dismantled after 30 years at the Donnington Park circuit in Leicestershire.

But he was taken aback today when he saw just how big it actually was exclaiming: 'Sh*t it's massive.'

Bargain: DJ Chris Evans checks out his latest purchase after Saturday's auction

Evans, 46, bought the whopping 230ft-long bridge - which resembles a huge car tyre - after it was auctioned by Bonhams at the Goodwood Revival race meeting in Surrey on Saturday.

The ginger-haired DJ, who has a fleet of top-of-the-range Ferraris and classic cars, told listeners on his breakfast show he had bought the bridge.

All mine: The ginger-haired DJ seemed thrilled with the results of the auction.

He joked that he was going to erect it over the top of his neighbour’s house in Berkshire but yesterday vowed to have it re-built in Leicestershire for race fans to enjoy.

After touching down on the race track by helicopter, he took a spin in a white Mazda around the course before spending half an hour sitting on one of the 18 large sections of bridge.

Touch down: the car enthusiast used an alternative mode of travel to visit Donnington

He said: 'It’s a lot bigger than I thought. Sh*t it’s massive. I didn’t realise how chunky it was. I can’t believe how big it is.

'It’s huge isn’t it? It’s the kind of thing you have on a farm to hold livestock in.

Oops: The bridge was a bit bigger than Chris had imagined when he put in his bid

'We’ve got to erect it somewhere. That’s what we are going to talk about while we are here.

'We were going to take it back to Berkshire and erect parts of it in my garden with my neighbour’s and the local council’s permission but there have been calls this morning to leave it here because this is its home.

National landmark: The bridge's new owner has sparked a lot of interest

'It’s one of the most important pieces of sporting memorabilia in the world so if Donington wants it to stay here then it can.

'We would like to find somewhere to re-erect the bridge and we would like things to happen under that bridge.

Flying visit: Chris looked excited but a little overawed with the bridge

'It was only £250, it was one of the greatest bargains of all time. It’s just over a pound per foot. It’s beyond a bargain, it redefines the term bargain.

'The auction price was a few thousand, then it came down to £1,000, then £500 and I thought I’d bid £250 just to start it off.

'But no-one else bid so I got it. I want to form a society and have an annual meeting at the bridge.

'I think the bridge should have its own Twitter account. It’s big, it’s cumbersome and right now it’s a bit of a problem but we need to get it back up.'

Asked if he would sell the bridge to be used at music festivals such as Download, Evans added: 'I don’t want to sell the bridge. I want to retain ownership of the bridge and keep it safe.

'It’s available for hire or to be played under so we will see.'

On his show Evans, who also presents The
One Show described his new purchase as a 'national landmark' and 
appealed for help getting it from the track to his house.

And despite conceding 
there could be 'planning issues', Evans, who also presents The One Show,
joked he was going to put up the bridge in his garden over the top of 
his neighbour’s house.

Landmark: The Dunlop Bridge at Donington Park was placed over the Leicestershire track in 1977

Car mad: Evans, 46, has a fleet of luxury cars, including a £5.6m Ferrari Spyder

He said: 'All kids listening to this show would say ‘yeah, why would you not buy a bridge?’

'There will be planning issues of course, with a temporary structure, but if we whittle it away at either end, affectionately and sympathetically, because it is a national landmark, I think I can get it down to four metres?'

Evans owns a fleet of luxury cars, including a £5.6m Ferrari Spyder.

Tyre company Dunlop originally paid for the bridge to be put over the Leicestershire track in 1977.

The structure was based on an identical bridge which has stood over the Circuit De La Sarthe, home of the Le Mans 24 hours, since 1932.

In 2009 the bridge was dismantled during planned renovations for the circuit’s former operator’s botched attempts to host the British Grand Prix.

When the move collapsed the owners of the circuit were unable to restore the bridge to its position over Starkey’s Straight due to health and safety laws.

Auction: Construction workers remove part of the iconic bridge earlier this month

Christopher Tate, managing director at the circuit, said: 'It had just been lying there in twenty pieces in a yard, which needs tidying up - so somebody had the idea of auctioning it off.

'Every now and then you’ve got to make some changes and we’ve got to tidy up the yard.'

The lot bought by Evans comprises 16 panel pieces which made the arch that decorated the footbridge.
