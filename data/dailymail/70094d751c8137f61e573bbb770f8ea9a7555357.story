David Cameron has revealed that his daughter Nancy is a budding entrepreneur who sold mince pies to his protection officers for £1 each.

At the launch of a new business campaign, the Prime Minister told how his eldest daughter asked to make the pies on New Year's Day and then flogged them to his detectives.

'Eight years old, I think it's a good spark of enterprise,' he told a group of entrepreneurs during a visit to Leeds.

Mr Cameron's anecdote came as he 
risked another row with France by declaring that the country's 35-hour 
working week had been bad for its economy.

The
Prime Minister said it was a 'mistake' for countries to think there is a
fixed number of jobs that can be 'carved up' equally between workers.  During
visit to Leeds, Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think the right way to think 
about an economy is that there's just a fixed number of jobs and it's a 
question of how you carve them up between young people, middle aged 
people and older people.

Mr Cameron once again risked the ire of Nicolas Sarkozy after suggesting that a 35-hour week for France had failed

'I
think that's the sort of mistake that other countries have made, when 
for instance, they've introduced a 35-hour working week.  

'They think 'Well, let's have a 
35-hour working week for everybody and then we share out the jobs that 
are available, what we find happens then is that your businesses become 
more expensive to run than anybody else's, you lose out to the 
competition and you have less jobs in the economy.'

French President Nicholas Sarkozy recently objected to the Prime Minister lecturing Europe over its debt crisis.

'We
are sick of you criticising us and telling us what to do,' he said at 
the time. 'You say you hate the euro and now you want to interfere in 
our meetings.'

Meanwhile, 
Mr Cameron announced that hundreds of empty Government offices will be 
thrown open to small firms in a bid to kick-start the economy.

Mr
Cameron wants budding entrepreneurs to be offered cheap rent deals on 
vacant and under-used Government buildings until they have established 
themselves.

The Prime Minister said that it was wrong for so many of the buildings to be sitting 'idle' when they could be used by small businesses.

There are an estimated 300 vacant Government buildings across the country – some of which have been empty for more than a decade.

While the properties lie empty, some have been costing taxpayers large sums in rent, business rates and other charges.

The Prime Minister also launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to believe 'there is a business in everyone'.

The Business in You drive will see companies hold workshops and give advice on tackling some of the issues faced by would-be bosses, with the scheme highlighted in radio, newspaper and billboard adverts throughout the year.

Mr Cameron said: 'I said 2012 has got to be the year we go for it, the year we light new fires of ambition in our economy, the year we get behind Britain's grafters, doers, hard-workers and entrepreneurs.

'This isn't something we'd quite like to do - it's something we've got to do because enterprise is critical to this country's future.

'Enterprise is what we do in Britain. This is the year that, more than ever, we've got to go for it.'
