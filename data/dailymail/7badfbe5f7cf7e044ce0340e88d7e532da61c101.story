Mel Gibson has accused police of 'harassing' him during a furious outburst after he was stopped while driving without his license.

The troubled Oscar-winning actor exploded with rage after being pulled over by Malibu police at a drink-drive checkpoint, according to TMZ.com.

The Hollywood star, 57, who had a woman in the passenger seat at the time, erupted when officers asked him to show his driving documents, ranting: 'Why are you harassing me?'

When asked why he was so angry, Gibson is reported to have said: 'I have had problems with 
you Lost Hills [Malibu] deputies in the past.'

Gibson was sober, and after his temper cooled, Gibson was let off with a warning for not having the correct documents on him, TMZ.com reports.

The incident is said to have occurred last Saturday 1am on the same stretch of road where he was infamously caught drink-driving in 2006.

A police report filed at the time cited the Braveheart star as cursing: 'F****** Jews... The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.'

He allegedly then asked the arresting deputy, 'Are you a Jew?'

Gibson's violent rages have been widely reported in the past.

His ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva has told how she feared he would kill her in a vicious assault.

She had said the actor brandished a gun at her during the violent argument.

The
Russian-born musician said the star choked her and insisted: ‘I thought
he would kill me…I was scared for my life and my daughter’s.’

Miss Grigorieva said Gibson often flew into jealous rages and talked about suicide.

On another occasion she claims he threw her son onto a table, but the Oscar-winning director has denied the allegations.

The pair went through a protracted and bitter custody battle after separating in 2011.

Gibson pleaded no-contest to a charge of  battery against Oksana Grigorieva in March, 2011, and has since completed the community service portion of his charge.

During this time, Gibson underwent a year-long course in anger management and domestic violence counselling.

A number of recordings made by 
Grigorieva were leaked online, allegedly showing Mel using violent, 
racist and abusive language towards her.

He tried to play them down, saying: 
'You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an 
irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to 
get out of a really unhealthy relationship.

'It’s one terribly, awful moment in 
time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn’t represent 
what I truly believe or how I’ve treated people my entire life.'
