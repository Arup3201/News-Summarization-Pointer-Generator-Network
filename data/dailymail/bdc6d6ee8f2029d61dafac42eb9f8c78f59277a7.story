Ricky Hatton has revealed how he self-harmed while on the brink of suicide as his life became enveloped by drink and drugs.

The retired fighter admits that depression took hold after his first ever loss, to Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in 2007.

He has described how he broke down in tears following the fight, feeling that he’d let everyone down, and turned to alcohol in a bid to block out his anguish.

The revelations come in Hatton's new book – War And Peace: My Story – extracts of which were published in The Sun on Sunday.

The 34-year-old said: ‘I was losing myself in Guinness after Guinness. I didn’t care what I looked like. I was on a suicide mission.’

He also said: ‘I lift the blade and terrible thoughts come into my head. I should end it sooner rather than later. The cold blade makes contact. I break the skin, pierce the flesh of my wrist. I just want to die.’

On the up: Ricky has said that he's in a much happier place now - partly due to the help he received from Sporting Chance

After losing to Manny Pacquiao in May 2009 in Las Vegas Hatton’s depression worsened and he turned to drugs.

He said: ‘I hoped drugs might make things better, shortly after the Pacquiao fight.’

A year later he was filmed by a newspaper snorting cocaine in a hotel room.

Hatton’s state of mind has much improved, in part thanks to help group Sporting Chance - founded by former Arsenal captain Tony Adams - which he said has taught him how to cope when things flare up.
