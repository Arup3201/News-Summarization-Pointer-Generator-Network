Yesterday, the Duchess of Cornwall revealed that the royal birth is imminent. Today, she had to make do with a tour of a Devonshire fishing village as another day passed without an appearance from the new third-in-line to the throne.

Despite the lack of a new Royal heir, the Duchess appeared to be in good spirits as she toured  the pretty town of Brixham, famous for its fish pie and picturesque harbour, with the Prince of Wales.

During the tour, Prince Charles found time to present the King George V Cup to the crew aboard the Pilgrim, a restored fishing trawler and the winner of the town's annual working trawler race.

The race, which has been run almost every year since the early 1800s, was originally for the Perpetual Challenge Cup before the race came to the attention and approval of King George V, after whom the modern cup is named.

After presenting the silver cup to the Pilgrim and its crew, the Prince and Duchess decamped to one of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute vessels moored in the harbour.

The visit to Brixham was part of the 
Duke and Duchess' annual three-day visit to the West Country, which yesterday saw 
them in the Cornish ports of Bude and St. Austell.

It was during a visit to a children's
hospice in Porthpean near St Austell, the Duchess of Cornwall hinted 
that royal baby was on the way, telling well-wishers to expect a bundle 
of joy by the ‘end of the week’.

With a due date of yesterday confirmed by Clarence House, the couple will have been on tenterhooks as they walked through the town, with the baby expected at any moment.

Should the child arrive during the couple's stay in the South-west, the drive back to London would take around five hours, although they have no plans to be present at the birth which is due to take place in the Lindo Wing at Paddington's St Mary's hospital.

Yesterday's tour took in Bude Town Centre where Camilla, who already has five young grandchildren of her own, was particularly taken with some of the young fans they met.

Many mothers brought their babies to meet them including Trudi Lindsay, with her three-week-old daughter Ellie-Mae, who told Charles: ‘You have got one of these coming soon’, to which the prince replied: ‘Hopefully!’ 

Later. Camilla gave an impromptu speech to assembled guests at the Porthpean hospice during which she said: ‘We are all just waiting by the 
telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be 
here.’

While his father and stepmother are touring Devon and Cornwall, it is understood that the Duke of Cornwall has taken a few days off from his work as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in North Wales.

Following
two long-standing charity polo matches at the weekend, during which the
Duchess decided stay with her parents in Berkshire, he and his wife 
will now remain at their Kensington Palace residence.

The palace is just a few minutes’ drive from St Mary’s in Paddington where Kate is hoping to have a natural birth.

The Duchy of Cornwall is one of England's two Royal Duchies, the other being the Duchy of Lancaster which is held in trust for the Queen.

Despite the name, more than half of the 133,658-acre estate is in Devon, while the rest is split between Cornwall, Herefordshire, Somerset and Wales.

As the eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Charles has held the Duchy since the moment he was born and it will pass to the Duke of Cambridge when Charles takes the throne.

The Duchy of Cornwall itself was created in 1337 out of what was the Earldom of Cornwall by King Edward III for his son, Edward, Prince of Wales who was better known by the nickname, the Black Prince.

Although the Black Prince died before he could become king, the Duchy has since been held by every monarch-in-waiting since, with the exception of Charles II, who was unable to occupy the Duchy thanks to the English Civil War.

After the Restoration in 1660, the Duchy was returned to the Crown.
