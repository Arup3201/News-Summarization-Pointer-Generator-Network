A swan dubbed 'Asboy' has become the latest in his family to terrorise punters and kayakers as they try to enjoy a relaxing jaunt on an idyllic Cambridge river.

The feathered fiend, who is the son of 'Mr Asbo', is now causing his own havoc on the River Cam after his father was removed in 2012 after becoming too violent.

'Asboy', who rules the roost by swimming up and down pecking at punters and flying into families on the waterway, has already attacked a canoeist and swimmer.

It has prompted locals to describe him as 'the most vicious swan ever' amid fears the animal may soon seriously injure someone.

At their last meeting the river authorities, The Cam Conservators, revealed how the bad-tempered bird attacks any boat which gets too close, including canoes and rowing boats.

'He's the most vicious swan I have ever seen. When I was punting with my family he stuck his neck in the boat and hissed and pecked at us,' said John Gale, 45, from Cambridge.

'I even saw him trying to bite through the chains which tether the punts to the wall of the river.'

Resident Mary Samuels, 67, who lives near the river, said many believed 'Asboy' was now worse than his predecessor.

'He swims up and down the river as if he is patrolling it and flaps his wings and hisses at anything which gets in his way,' she said.

One resident said 'Asboy' was now worse than his vicious father who had to be moved 60 miles away 

Punt operators believe some tourists are flocking to Cambridge just to see 'Asboy' and take photos of him

'We thought things would settle down when they removed Mr Asbo, but his son is much worse. There have been some near misses and I don't think it will be long before someone is really injured.'

One punt operator said: 'Asboy seems to have become a bit of a tourist attraction and people are even more interested in taking photos of him than King's College.'

The Cam Conservators moved 'Asboy's' father 'Mr Asbo' to a secret location about 60 miles away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself.

His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises and a special marshal even had to be employed during a university rowing race to prevent him from injuring the students.

Ever since, 'Asboy' has taken over as chief of the waterway and has spent the last 18 months trying to scare visitors away.  

He hasn't just taken a disliking to humans though - he has also been spotted attacking one his own, as well as confronting a huge bull.

Last year, horrified tourists watched on as 'Asboy' ferociously grabbed a passing swan by the neck with his beak, held it under the water for 15 seconds and then sat on it to stop it wriggling free. 

The hapless victim only escaped the attack when its partner came to the rescue.

The river authorities, The Cam Conservators, confirmed the bird had already attacked a swimmer and canoeist

However, 'Asboy' met his match when he left his safe haven of the water and tried to scare off a huge bullock.

The huge animal was simply grazing on the riverbank when the swan approached and prepared to launch an attack.

However, the bullock was having none of it and, unperturbed, simply advanced towards 'Asboy' and put him back in his place by forcing him back down into the river.
