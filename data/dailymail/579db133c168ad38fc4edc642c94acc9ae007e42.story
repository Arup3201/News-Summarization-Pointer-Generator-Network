The FBI has been called in to help analyse the home flight simulator belonging to the pilot of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane.

A US official, speaking anonymously, says the FBI is currently working on data from the simulator while Malaysia's defense minister says investigators are trying to restore files.

It is thought the files were deleted last month by pilot Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Files containing records of simulations carried out on the program were deleted February 3.

Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday U.S. investigators are prepared to help any way they can.

Diego Garcia, a remote island in the middle of the Indian Ocean with a runway long enough to land a Boeing 777 was programmed into the home flight simulator of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, it has been revealed

Police are now urgently investigating whether Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had practised landing at Diego Garcia, an island south of the Maldives occupied by the US navy

Malaysia's defense minister 
Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the pilot, Capt. 
Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is considered innocent until proven guilty of any 
wrongdoing, and that members of his family are cooperating in the 
investigation.

Deleting files would not necessarily 
represent anything unusual, especially if it were to free up memory 
space, but investigators would want to check the files for any signs of 
unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane 
went.

Today it was also revealed that a remote island in the middle of the Indian Ocean with
 a runway long enough to land a Boeing 777 was programmed into the home 
flight simulator of the pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

 are now urgently investigating whether Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had 
practised landing at Diego Garcia, an island south of the Maldives 
occupied by the US navy.

People on the island of Kuda Huvadhoo reported seeing ''low flying jumbo jet' on the morning of the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370

 seized the simulator from his home outside Kuala Lumpur over the

information on the flight's fate.

The investigation into the Diego Garcia,
 an overseas territory of the UK, which is rented to the US and is now a
 huge American naval base follows fresh eyewitness accounts of a 'low flying jumbo jet' being spotted in the Maldives.

People on the
 island of Kuda Huvadhoo reported seeing a plane on the morning of the 
disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to a 
Haveeru, a news website in the Maldives.

An eyewitness told the website: 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly.

'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.'

Captain Shah, a father-of-three, was passionate about his simulator, which he built using off-the-shelf parts.

His best friend Peter Chong insisted the simulator was just for fun and told MailOnline: 'His hobby was flying. It’s nothing special. He loves flying and he wants to share with my his friends. He was open to his friends.’

Capt Zaharie had joined an online flight simulator community called X-Sim and after making his simulator, in November 2012 he posted a message about its 'awesome view' inviting 'buddies' to get in touch so they could take the simulator 'to the next level of simulation. Motion!'

'Elo guys, zaharie here,' says the post.

'Awesome view on 3 panasonic 32 in. LCD HDMI and and 3 touchscreen Dell 21 inches for main (MCP) , center pedestal, overhead panel.

'Time to take to the next level of simulation.Motion! looking for buddies to share this passion.

Investigators probing the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board believe it most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said today.

No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.

An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search 'corridors': one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia.

'The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.

China, which is leading the northern corridor search with Kazakhstan, said it had not yet found any sign of the aircraft crossing into its territory.

Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.

The minister in charge of the operation said the multinational search team was deploying the most sophisticated equipment available to find the plane.

'It probably is the largest peacetime armada of assets and satellite information-sharing that we have ever seen for a rescue and search operation,' Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.

Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.

The source close to the investigation said that it was thought 'highly probable that ACARS was switched off prior to the final verbal message' received for the cockpit.

That message, an informal 'all right, good night' radioed to Malaysian air traffic controllers to acknowledge their handover of the plane to Vietnamese airspace, was believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline said earlier this week.

Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that minutes later the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India.

After that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. The data from the satellite placed the plane somewhere in one of the two corridors when the final signal was sent at 8:11 a.m.

The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, have been interpreted as suggesting strongly that foul play, rather than some kind of technical failure, was behind the disappearance.

Last week, a source familiar with official U.S. assessments said it was thought most likely the plane flew south, where it presumably would have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.

If it did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.

U.S. government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives.

A senior U.S. official said he was 'not aware of any stones left unturned'. China has said there is no evidence that Chinese passengers, who made up over two-thirds of those on board, were involved in a hijack or act of sabotage.

Australia is leading the search of the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.

It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.

The U.S. Navy said it had switched mainly to using P-8A Poseidon and P-3 Orion aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters.

'The maritime patrol aircraft are much more suited for this type of operation,' said Navy Lieutenant David Levy, who is on board the USS Blue Ridge. '...It's just a much more efficient way to search.'
